@entity0 will show @entity1 the way when it comes to transparency around a major inquiry when their doping investigation reports in february			1
@entity1 continue to prevaricate on how much of @entity8 ’s probe into @entity10 bid corruption will ever be made public because of confidentiality issues despite a global demand that it is seen in full			1
but @entity14 , @entity15 president of @entity16 — cycling ’s ruling body — has promised their own investigation into cycling ’s chronic drugs problem will be published in full			1
@entity16 president @entity14 ( left ) says his organisation , unlike @entity24 's @entity1 , will publish their report the question of confidentiality will be solved by redacting any names or detail where there is an issue			1
@entity1 , who have left it to compliance chief @entity34 to decide how much of @entity8 ’s findings to release , should follow @entity38 ’s lead			1
@entity39 lawyer @entity8 has criticised @entity1 's refusal to publish the report which he wrote meanwhile , @entity14 flew business class from @entity43 to @entity44 yesterday for the @entity45 in @entity46			1
in contrast , @entity47 , head of the @entity48 , was in economy			1
the only @entity15 presidents of @entity53 summer sports had never met and were introduced on the @entity55 bus taking them from @entity44 to @entity46			2
@entity57 , who can not compete with the @entity60 ’s big spenders , are looking to @entity61 for football prospects			2
a delegation led by new palace ambassador @entity64 went to the @entity65 yesterday to search for a young star and forge long - term links			2
@entity57 have set up a partnership with @entity70 - managed @entity69 and will be holding trials for the most promising 16 - 19 - year - olds			2
@entity74 's @entity57 side are looking to foreign markets to compete at the highest level they will also offer the winner of a @entity60 talent festival an opportunity to train at the @entity57 academy			1
@entity83 ’s announcement that her new @entity85 contract will see her present just @entity87 and @entity88 racing did not go down well at @entity90			2
not only did it coincide with their free racing day to encourage newcomers to the sport , but @entity83 has prioritised working on the @entity96 for @entity97 rather than @entity100 ’s @entity99 flagship when the two clash in 2015			2
@entity90 are not happy that @entity83 will not be presenting @entity103 's coverage of the @entity99 an @entity90 spokesman described the timing as ‘ unfortunate ’			1
@entity83 wanted to tell her @entity85 colleagues first at @entity107			0
. @entity1 president @entity24 should be suitably embarrassed at the @entity108 when age - limit proposals are rubber - stamped that will mean him stepping down when he reaches 80 in may 2016			1
by then he could be just a year into an unbelievable fifth term as @entity1 overlord with three more years to go			1
@entity24 made his most impassioned @entity55 speech during the @entity114 when he argued that any age limit was ‘ discriminatory ’			0
@entity24 may be forced to step down from the @entity55 in 2016 , although he is likely to still be running @entity1 @entity116 needs a push @entity116 ‘ s two majors and a @entity120 success makes him the strongest candidate to become @entity122			1
nothing is certain , however , with golf always seeming reticent about promoting its cause — as seen when the @entity127 ’ rugby league side beat @entity129 ’s victorious @entity120 squad to the 2006 team award			0
despite his two major wins , @entity116 might be hampered in the @entity97 poll by golf fans ' refusal to vote now it is likely that @entity137 ’s bigger social media traffic will see world champion @entity138 over the line first			0
@entity141 chief @entity140 has defended his organisation ’s use of the @entity144 when it come to deciding funding			0
@entity144 was due to be published last thursday but flaws in an outside company ’s data research means it has been delayed until the end of next month			0
this brought criticism from some sports that @entity141 are far too influenced by @entity144 findings when awarding funds			0
one leading figure calling the statistics ‘ deeply flawed civil servant nonsense ’			0
but @entity140 said : ‘ @entity144 is a fantastic tool that we have trusted to deliver long - term trends in participation			0
but it is not the only research we use and sports tend to like or dislike @entity144 depending on how the results affect them			0
’ the @entity168 have stayed in - house when choosing their director of communications			0
the job has gone to the loyal @entity172 after she showed great passion and enthusiasm for the role — despite there being a long list of outside candidates .			0

@entity14 confirms cycling *governing* body will push for transparency
@entity1 have so far refused to publish @entity8 's report in full
@entity16 will get round confidentiality issues by redacting names or details
