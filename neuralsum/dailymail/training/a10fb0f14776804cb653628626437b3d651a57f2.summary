by @entity0 police are hunting for two fraudsters who pocketed £ 50,000 by selling someone else ’s house			2
the two men put the terraced home in @entity8 , @entity9 , on the market through a specialist agency and managed to complete a sale using fake driving licences			1
their scam was only uncovered when the @entity15 looked at the sale and found out that the names on the two ids - of the man and woman who actually owned the house - did not match the photos , which were of two men			1
suspects : @entity9 police are looking for the two men pictured above in connection with the scam			2
the names used on the ids used in the sale , of a man and a woman , were correct , but did not match the photos police are now unable to trace the pair - who had no link to the property - and believe it is the first time the scam has been pulled off in @entity40			1
@entity25 has released the pictures of two @entity43 men used on the fake driving licences in a bid to track down the fraudsters			1
the terraced home was listed for sale on a specialist buy - to - let website in 2012 and the sale was finalised in december that year			1
it was vacant at the time because the occupants had moved elsewhere			0
although the sale had been completed by the fraudsters , when the documents were lodged for registration with @entity15 the fraud was detected and the forged deeds rejected			2
and a man from @entity59 who had bought the property managed to get his money back from insurers			0
detective constable @entity63 , from @entity25 , said : ' the money that went into the bank account was very quickly withdrawn and spirited away to purchase gold bullion and other things			0
listed online : a street in @entity8 , @entity9 , where the property was put up for sale			1
@entity9 police said that the owner of the home had no idea what was going on ' they knew what they were doing			2
we ’ve spoken to the owner of the home who was n’t particularly impressed - he certainly had no idea what was going on			0
' this gentleman became aware that this property was for sale			0
he asked a solicitor in @entity88 to carry out a purchase for him which they did via a company in @entity92			0
' two @entity43 males purporting to be the owners of the property provided proof of @entity97 as required to the @entity92 solicitor and the sale went through			0
' fortunately the @entity15 were carrying out some sample testing and they looked at the driving licences of the owner and his wife used in the sale			1
' the names were correct but the pictures used were both of males			0
' the property was listed at a reduced price which drew the buyer ’s attention to it			0
this was an extraordinary crime , in which those involved were able to fraudulently deceive everyone involved in the sale of the house for their own gain			2
' we have been investigating all lines of inquiry into this case , and we hope that by releasing the photographs which were used on the fake driving licences , we can track down the individuals whom we wish to speak to			1
