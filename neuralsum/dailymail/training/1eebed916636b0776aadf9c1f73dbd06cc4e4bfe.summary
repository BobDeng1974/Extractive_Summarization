a deal has reportedly been reached to secure the release in a ceasefire agreement terrified : some 276 girls were seized from their dormitories at the @entity26 in the remote town of @entity15 in @entity28 , northeastern @entity2 , in april , but dozens managed to escaped eight @entity32 soldiers and 107 @entity8 militants have been killed in fighting in the far north of @entity32 , the defence ministry said in a statement read on state radio on friday			1
@entity8 has stepped up cross-border attacks into @entity32 this year as part of its campaign for a de facto @entity41 state in northeastern @entity2			2
@entity8 negotiators ' assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well , ' @entity47 , the government spokesman on the insurgency , told a news conference			0
@entity8 has been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls			1
there was no immediate word from @entity8 , which limits its announcements almost exclusively to videos of its leader @entity58			1
it could take days for word to get to its fighters , who are broken into several groups			0
they include foreigners from neighboring countries @entity67 , @entity32 and @entity68 , where the insurgents also have camps			0
there have been unconfirmed reports that at least some of the girls have been carried across borders , and some forced to marry their captors			2
a @entity8 video in may showed two of the girls explaining why they had converted from @entity80 to @entity81			2
the chief of defense staff , air marshal @entity82 , announced the truce and ordered his troops to immediately comply with the agreement			0

he confirmed there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the abducted girls			2
another official said the talks took place in neighbouring @entity67			0
he spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to reporters			0
@entity8 was founded in 2002 by @entity111 – but it did n’t gain worldwide notoriety until it began a violent insurgency in earnest in 2009			0
ultimately , the group wants @entity2 to become an @entity81 state			1
since mid- 2009 , it has killed thousands and has destabilised swathes of the northeast of @entity2 , as well as neighbours @entity32 and @entity68			2

firefighters and rescuers extinguish a fire at the scene of a bomb blast at @entity136 in the central city of @entity138 , @entity2 , in may , in one of two explosions blamed on terror group @entity8 @entity111 established an @entity81 school and mosque , which proved popular with many poor @entity130 families			1
he was killed by @entity2 security forces in 2009 , but rather than weaken the group , it re-emerged with increased ferocity under the leadership of @entity58			1
it has bombed churches , barracks and even the @entity153 headquarters and often uses gunmen on the back of motorbikes to ruthless cut down those who criticise it			0
president @entity158 became so alarmed at the chaos the group was spreading that in 2013 he declared a state of emergency in the areas where it was most active – @entity28 , @entity164 and @entity165			2
the @entity2 military has been fairly ineffective against the heavily armed group			1
a lack of investment in training , failure to maintain equipment and dwindling cooperation with @entity127 forces has damaged @entity2 's armed services , while in @entity8 they face an increasingly well - armed , determined foe			1

‘ in a typical unit , @entity8 has between 300 and 500 fighters			0
it 's not a guerrilla force that you can fight half heartedly , ’ said @entity196 , a @entity8 expert at @entity198 counter-terrorism institution @entity197 said in may			0
it 's getting more weapons , more recruits , their power is increasing every day			0
’ on february 12 dozens of fighters loyal to @entity8 attacked a remote military outpost in the @entity210 hills			0
a security source with knowledge of the assault said they came in @entity216 tracks with mounted machine guns and showered the camp with gunfire			0
@entity8 's fighters had little cover and were easily picked off - 50 of them died against nine @entity2 troops - but they still managed to make off with the base 's entire armoury stockpile of 200 mortar bombs , 50 rocket - propelled grenades and hundreds of rounds of ammunition , the source said			1
their ability to dart over the border into @entity32 , whose own security forces have shown little appetite for taking them on , gives the militants an added advantage			0
ethnic and religious divisions within the military have also bred some collusion with @entity8 , sources say			0

' the @entity2 military has twice claimed its leader @entity290 had been killed , but @entity8 later issued video denials			1
the latest one came earlier this month when he was apparently seen in a video that shows the beheading of a man who identifies himself the pilot of a missing @entity2 @entity298 jet their plight drew global attention , magnified by a # @entity249 @entity248 campaign that drew in celebrities including @entity267 and @entity268			2
