by @entity1 reporter published : 02:26 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 28 november 2013 what will they think of next ? students at the @entity5 have developed a tangible display platform that allows users to touch things through their computer screens			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , @entity13 candidates at the @entity14 in @entity15 , are the creators behind @entity17 , a machine that uses a camera feed to turn things into @entity22 objects in real time			1
it works just like a pin - screen toy - as in the kind you find in museum novelty shops - except that under each pin is a motor that reacts to a ‘ kinect ’ depth - sensing camera made by @entity33 , which is usually used in games , according to @entity36			1
the camera is able to capture depth data and transmits it to the table , which then forms a physical object			2
what we can expect in the future ? a demonstrator shows how , by using camera footage of his hands , he is able to pick up a ball using the @entity17 grid remember these ? the @entity17 grid uses the same principles as an old - school pin board toy , however instead of a physical touch , it just needs a camera feed , which the machine then mimics			1
pictured is one of the @entity17 creators , @entity10 the @entity5 students who created the screen say it is only very early days in the technology , with the grid pins only able to move up and down to form an object essentially @entity17 is just mimicking what the camera sees , thanks to a grid of 900 columns arranged in a 30 by 30 grid , which adjusts in height based on the image it receives			1
@entity11 said the idea was borne out of frustrations with modern touch - screen technology			1
' if you think about things like @entity79 or video conferencing tools , it misses out on some of the ways we naturally interact , ' he told @entity83			0
' things like hand gestures can be lost when you 're collaborating at a distance			0
' the pair hope the idea will one day apply to smart phones , rendering buttons and menus when they are needed			0
' we see a need for displays to become more physical again , ' said @entity10			0
the next step : it is hoped the technology will one day apply to phones , with the device being able to become another object and create buttons for users developers use a ball to show how physical the @entity17 machine becomes when forming an object ' this could make future smartphones and tablets much more intuitive and satisfying to use			2
' the team has already attracted the attention of several businesses , ' musicians who want to create new musical instruments , or people who want to make an interface for blind users ' , according to the @entity118			2
' it ’s inspiring people and we ’re glad so many ideas are coming in , ' @entity10 said			0
however there is a long way to go until @entity17 is a consumer product , with its creators acknowledges these are very early days			2
' in the future , more and more devices will be able to change their shape , ' @entity11 said			0
' i envision a future where a device changes shape to better interact with its owner			0

two students at the @entity5 have developed a display grid that is able to mimic the vision of a camera feed and form *3d* objects
the machine , called @entity17 , uses principles similar to that of an old school pin - screen toy , only without the need for physical contact
having already attracted the interest of several businesses , the platform could well be the next stage in touch screen phone technology , with devices being able to form into objects and produce buttons
