by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor a law to allow assisted suicide for the terminally ill could become ‘ state - approved self - extinction ’ , @entity2 has warned			1
the @entity7 mayor said plans to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to anyone who could ' reasonably be expected to die within six months ' could mean some people come under pressure to end their lives too soon			1
mr @entity2 warned ‘ life is precious and our psychology fragile ’ and any change to the law must be made with caution			2
on friday peers will debate a law allowing doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live			1
the legislation has been drawn up by @entity27 , a former @entity28 lord chancellor who served in @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
the @entity31 has urged @entity27 to drop his @entity32 in favour of a @entity34 into the issue			1
mr @entity2 revealed he has met the campaign dignity in @entity37 to discuss the issue ahead of this week ’s debate			1
he said he found the young woman he met ‘ charming and persuasive ’ , he became concerned about the wording of the @entity32			2
writing in the @entity42 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i started to worry that it might indeed pave the way for something unintended – something ugly and distressing : not exactly a culture of death , but a world in which it was simply too easy to opt for this state - approved self - extinction			0
’ the @entity52 , to be debated on friday states that doctors would be able to prescribe a lethal dose of medicine to people who could ‘ reasonably be expected to die within six months ’			1
mr @entity2 suggested that the wording be ‘ tighetned up ’ to cover only those people who ‘ could not reasonably be expected to survive more than six months ’			2
he added : i think it right to be cautious , because we are proposing to make a very big change in our approach to death and dying : giving people much more of a right to choose when to die , and above all giving the state an obligation to help us consciously to do away with ourselves , if certain conditions are satisfied			1
‘ i am sure it is a change the public broadly supports , and one whose time has come			0
but life is precious and our psychology fragile			0
‘ those suffering terminal illnesses can easily find themselves under pressure – external or internal – to make decisions from which , obviously , there is no going back			2
’ archbishop of canterbury @entity81 warned a proposed new law on assisted dying is ‘ mistaken and dangerous ’ , but his predecessor @entity84 insists it would not be ‘ anti-christian ’ to change the law former archbishop @entity87 says he would not like his life to be ' prolonged artificially ' @entity27 ’s @entity89 would require patients to administer the poison themselves			1
it would not help those who are paralysed or lack the capacity to operate a mechanism to inject the drugs			0
existing rules effectively mean no relative or friend will be prosecuted for aiding a suicide if it is done out of compassion and not for gain			0
but they ban @entity104 doctors taking any role in a death			2
@entity27 ’s @entity32 would enable doctors to help a patient die by prescribing deadly drugs if they are terminally ill and expected to die within six months			1
the patient would have to be over 18 and to have lived in @entity111 or @entity112 for at least a year			0
two doctors would have to certify the patient was terminally ill and it was their informed wish to die			1
the patient would also have to signify their consent			0
there would be 14 days before drugs were provided , or six days if death was expected within a month			0
last week former archbishop of @entity122 revealed that he had dropped his long - standing opposition to the legalisation of assisted dying – and declared that it would not be ‘ anti-christian ’ to change the law			1
he warned that by opposing reform , the @entity31 he led risks ' promoting anguish and pain , the very opposite of a @entity133 message of hope			0
’ however , current archbishop of @entity136 , @entity81 , said warned the @entity52 would leave a ‘ sword of damocles ’ hanging over the elderly , putting them under pressure to end their lives			1
yesterday former archbishop @entity87 came out in favour of a change in the law on the right to die			1
writing in @entity145 , he said : ‘ yes , i think a lot of people would be upset if i said i wanted assisted dying			1
i would say i would n't mind actually			0
‘ i have come to realise that i do not want my life to be prolonged artificially			0
‘ i think when you need machines to help you breathe then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent			0
this may be hard for some people to consider			2
’ he argued that money should be focussed ‘ a mother giving birth to a baby , or an organ transplant needed by a young person ’			0
the @entity163 , the right reverend @entity164 , yesterday became the first serving bishop to back the right to die			2
he said : ‘ i have come to support assisted dying precisely because i do believe strongly in the sanctity of life			1
' part of honouring this is respecting people ’s integrity to make decisions about themselves			2
’ about right : sir @entity174 is backing the bill sir @entity174 , the former chief inspector of schools who is now a quadriplegic , yesterday gave his backing to @entity27 ’s @entity89			1
he believes the proposals are ‘ about right ’ and in tune with public opinion			0
and he said the @entity27 law would allow doctors who help suffering patients to die to be free from the threat of prosecution and career disaster			1
‘ they would have the option and they would know that they were not going to be prosecuted under any circumstance			0
’ sir @entity174 made his reputation challenging the educational establishment over school standards in the 1990s			1
he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2006 and subsequently told he has cancer and other complications			0
he told the @entity201 programme on @entity202 that the decision to end one ’s life ‘ must be a matter for consideration within the family and arguably with close friends as well ’			0
‘ i would n’t dream of proceeding with the decision to kill myself or to have my death assisted without the acceptance of those who are nearest and dearest to me , ’ he said			0
the @entity27 proposals were ‘ about right , given the range of public opinion on this issue ’			2
alternatives were ‘ bleak ’			0
‘ i would be far better if i could have my death assisted in a peaceful , dignified way so that my suffering was n’t prolonged			0
