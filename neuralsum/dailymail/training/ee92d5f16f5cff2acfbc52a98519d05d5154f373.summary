' ' still , covering the @entity3 is a big deal			0
stations like @entity41 and @entity42 entrust their programming to veterans			0
so when people talk about all networks making a turn to a particular type of girl on the sidelines , it does n’t hold water			2
' the 53 - year - old says @entity19 told her they wanted the network to look radically different , which she assumes meant they wanted to look younger @entity11 pursued a career in broadcast journalism after excelling in college sports , notably track and field , where she was selected @entity60			1

after the nfc championship game , it was @entity5 , not @entity11 , who got the sideline interview with @entity96 , where the adrenaline - fueled corner called out 49ers receiver @entity86			1
