@entity0 signed for @entity1 for £ 16m to plug a hole in their porous defence			2
the @entity6 star played left back for @entity6 in the @entity7 and on his debut for his new club at @entity10 against @entity11			1
but he will be played more through the middle , possibly starting against @entity13 this weekend , and here our @entity15 blogger @entity14 , who watched @entity0 extensively for @entity17 , rates him as a left back and centre half			1
@entity0 played left back against @entity11 but could play centre half against @entity13 @entity0 is a better left back than a centre half , in my opinion			1
here in @entity15 he played almost all of @entity17 's matches at centre back but for @entity6 , he deployed is on the left side of the defence			1
at left back he has more confidence - he made more interceptions , tackles and even completed a greater number of passes playing there			0
as we say in @entity35 , at full back he is ' on the beach '			0
as a centre back - where he played the majority of his games for @entity17 - he prefers to use his physicality and his excellent anticipation to disturb his opponents on the ground , but he could do better in the air			2
he is also sometimes found wanting in his marking and positioning , which for a player in that position is crucial			0
the @entity6 defender ( right ) played most of his football at @entity17 in the centre of defence @entity0 ( left ) showed he is not afraid to put in a challenge during his @entity1 debut against @entity11 however , do n't think he will make mistakes in all of his matches			1
@entity0 is the kind of footballer that has an excellent game one week but then his weaknesses appear in the next game , particularly at centre half			2
he is not a panicker			0
when he plays left back , @entity0 is able to go forward with possession			2
he is good on the ball , has excellent vision and the eye for a pass in attacking areas			0
he made plenty of goals for sporting last season			0
but to do a great job at centre back , he has to have an excellent covering defender at his side			0
here in @entity15 he did well because he played with a great partner , @entity78 - they conceded 19 goals in 29 games , the fewest in the @entity81 - who had more experience in that position			0
the defender 's disciplinary record at @entity17 was not brilliant and he was sent off five times last year @entity0 could be deployed at centre half when @entity1 travel to @entity13 this weekend although he was often played at centre back , @entity0 struggled unless he had an experienced player alongside if @entity0 does not have a solid player alongside him , however , there will be more mistakes			1
i can say that the £ 16million which @entity1 paid was for @entity0 the left back - he is n't worth that kind of money at centre half			1
he can still do it but not with the same effectiveness as in his favourite position of left back			0
it will be a tough examination for @entity0 at centre half in a porous @entity1 defence vs the newly - promoted foxes @entity0 was deployed at left back for @entity6 during the @entity7 , when they reached the final in @entity108 follow @entity14 on @entity109 @ _ @entity110			1

@entity0 made his @entity1 debut against @entity11 at left back
he also played left back for @entity6 during the @entity7 in @entity108
@entity0 played centre half for long periods for @entity17
he is a better left back than he is a central defender
@entity0 struggles in the air and with positioning and marking
he is excellent physically on the ground and has good anticipation
the @entity125 could be deployed at centre half against @entity13
