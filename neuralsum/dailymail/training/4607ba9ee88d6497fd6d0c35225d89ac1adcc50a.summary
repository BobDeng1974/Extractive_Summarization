leading musician : @entity6 , 60 , and his grand piano ( rear ) in a family photo			2
he is now in a care home and has been left with a cheap £ 99 keyboard he has been forced to play the cheap children 's instrument despite complaints from his wife - and having two grand pianos worth £ 30,000 in his home in @entity28			1
@entity29 , 48 , is pleading for him to be discharged but he will need 24 hour home care because she has a spinal disease and osteoarthritis so is unable to look after him alone			1
the pianist has performed around the world raising thousands for charity and has taught generations of youngsters how to play			2
but his world changed in may 2010 when he was diagnosed with @entity39 , a rare degenerative condition which is similar to @entity41 's			1
he was finally put in @entity42 care home in @entity44 , @entity45 , last december as his condition got worse			0
happy : mr @entity6 , a leading pianist , with his wife @entity29 , 48 , during a day out			1
she is fighting to have him brought home ' @entity49 ' : the £ 99 keyboard which has been put in mr @entity6 's room in a care home			1
his wife describes it as an ' insult ' his wife , who is also a piano teacher , said he could have just a few weeks left to live and has appointed a solicitor as she fights to have him brought back			1
she has been fighting the decision to put him into care since last december - and has accused the @entity58 of using ' delaying tactics ' to keep him in care for the last six months			2
she said : ' giving him a cheap keyboard is an insult			0
one of the biggest arguments for him being brought home is his need for music but they came up with this keyboard which i was totally against			0
treatment : mr @entity6 in his care home			1
he is suffering from the advanced stages of @entity9 's disease ' he has always argued about the best way to make a beautiful sound and would never play a keyboard			1
' it is a misunderstanding of who he is			0
' i told them my husband does not play keyboards but they did not listen and refused to take it away			0
he was asked by care home staff if he likes it and he said " yes "			0
' he knows all about keyboard and because of his condition they thought they were asking about music - so he did not understand the question			0
' rather than provide him with a more expensive instrument , mrs @entity92 wants her husband back home - which she says would be the best possible treatment for him			2
she has accused @entity45 of putting mr @entity6 in care because it is cheaper than caring for him in the home - which they deny			1
the pianist grew up on a council estate and rose to become one of the country 's leading performers			0
he met @entity29 , his second wife , on a piano weekend in @entity108 in 2006 and they married two years later			2
mr @entity6 does not have any children but has two step - children who he treats as his own			1
mrs @entity92 added : ' his illness is at an advanced stage and he could die at any time			0
he is in a stable condition but he has suffered fitting and has difficulties swallowing			0
' ' he has been in a home since december 15 but i want to bring him home so he can be cared for here and he wants to be home			0
happy couple : mr @entity6 with his new wife @entity29 on their wedding day in 2008			1
they had met just two years beforehand during a piano weekend in @entity108 ' the @entity127 are refusing to let me bring him back and for the last few months they have come up with reasons why they should delay things			0
it has been a really difficult time			0
' mrs @entity92 still teaches piano and worked in a childrens ' hospice for eight years before she met her husband			0
the couple have grand piano 's made by @entity138 and @entity139 in their home			2
a spokesman for @entity45 said a decision on whether the patient should be sent home will be taken by the end of the week			0
' @entity45 is already providing 24 hour care for mr @entity6			1
we are now looking at whether we can provide this care at home and are considering the wide range of issues that need to be addressed to achieve this			0
' mrs @entity92 is aware that we are making our decision this week			0
this will be based solely on what is considered to be most appropriate to meet mr @entity6 ’s ongoing healthcare needs , following a very detailed assessment			2
' @entity45 is responsible for funding mr @entity6 ’s continuing health care and was not involved in providing him with a keyboard			1
' happy : mr @entity6 , left , was put in a care home last december after being diagnosed with @entity9 's disease in may 2010			1
