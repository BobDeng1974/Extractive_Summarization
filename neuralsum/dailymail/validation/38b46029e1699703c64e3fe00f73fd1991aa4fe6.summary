pm @entity0 has said he would not bid for a third term for many of the greatest leaders in our history , one word was simply beyond them			1
from @entity9 and @entity10 to @entity11 and @entity12 , they could not bring themselves to say goodbye			2
so by historical standards , @entity0 ’s revelation that , if the voters send him back to @entity1 in may , he will step down after five years and allow somebody else to lead the conservatives into the 2020 election , counts as a genuine bombshell			1
for some time , this has been predicted in @entity22			2
but nobody expected him to say so publicly , and certainly nobody thought he would do it on the brink of one of the tightest and most unpredictable election campaigns in history			1
not for mr @entity0 the solemn goodbye in an address to the nation			1
instead , he announced his intentions in a throwaway interview with a @entity36 journalist			2
it was absolutely typical of the man , the quintessence of laid - back insouciance			2
even his rhetoric seemed remarkably casual			2
terms in office , he remarked , ‘ are like @entity44 : two are wonderful but three might just be too many ’			1
what makes mr @entity0 ’s announcement so extraordinary is that there is simply no historical precedent			1
the great majority of his predecessors tried to cling on to power as long as possible , and had to be dragged kicking and screaming from office			0
@entity11 , for example , famously led her party into a third general election in 1987 with a promise that she would go ‘ on and on ’ – a remark that delighted her admirers and horrified her critics			1
few people doubt that had she not been toppled in a coup in 1990 , she would have led the @entity63 into a fourth election two years later			1
indeed , if the @entity65 had had her way , she would have led them into the 21st century , too			0
but mrs @entity11 was far from unusual			0
the @entity69 titan @entity9 led the @entity70 to victory in 1892 at the staggering age of 82 , long after most of his colleagues thought he should have stepped down			0
@entity10 , too , had to be prised from office like an oyster from a shell			0
he should have resigned in glory after winning @entity78 and losing the 1945 general election			1
instead , he refused to budge , even though he was increasingly debilitated by old age and a series of strokes			0
the most obvious recent example , though , is @entity12 , whose premiership was undermined almost from the very beginning by gossip about the succession			0
according to @entity88 and his friends , mr @entity12 had promised to step aside after two elections for his ambitious chancellor			0
but when he refused to do so , their relations degenerated into virtual civil war			0
in 2004 , mr @entity12 promised that if he won a third election he would soon resign to give his successor time to prepare for @entity98 ’s tilt at a fourth term in office			1
the @entity101 were furious at the delay			0
but far from lancing the boil of speculation , mr @entity12 ’s announcement only made matters worse			0
from that moment , his aura of leadership began to seep away			0
since everyone knew he was going , they had nothing to lose in challenging his authority			0
and so it was that mr @entity12 ’s final two years in office , overshadowed by constant bickering over the date of his departure , were effectively a drawn - out public execution , as the former master of @entity121 politics suffered an agonising death by a thousand cuts			2
i am sorry to say this is almost certainly the scenario that awaits mr @entity0			1
and his decision is all the more mystifying because he is under relatively little pressure to step aside			0
whatever you think of mr @entity0 , the unarguable fact is that he remains the @entity63 ’ single biggest asset			1
for the past ten years he has been comfortably more popular than his party			2
on top of that , mr @entity0 is clearly the most popular and credible of the major party leaders			1
neither the laughable @entity141 or the anodyne @entity142 comes close to challenging his public standing			0
while he has his critics on the @entity147 backbenches , a leadership challenge would be almost unthinkable if he managed to win another term in may			2
if i had been advising mr @entity0 , i would have urged him to emulate @entity150 , who showed no sign of going anywhere until his shock resignation in 1976			1
like mr @entity0 , the @entity98 prime minister was the dominant political personality of his age			1
he shrugged off accusations that he lacked substance to win election after election			2
he even managed to bounce back from defeat in 1970 – as i believe mr @entity0 could , too , if he really wanted to			1
so @entity150 ’s resignation , at the age of 60 , stunned the nation			0
there had been not the slightest public suspicion that he was planning a quick exit			0
by contrast , mr @entity0 has , i think , made a rod for his own back			1
if he returns to no 10 in may , which looks increasingly likely , then it will be as a lame - duck prime minister			0
for the awkward squad on the @entity147 backbenches , the penalties for rebellion will seem trivial and short - lived , since a new leader will be along in a year or two			0
and for the prime minister ’s ambitious colleagues , the leadership campaign will begin on the day he walks back into @entity183			0
@entity0 and his wife @entity184 invited the cameras into their @entity187 home ahead of the election , during which the prime minister made the revelation that he would step down before a third term indeed , for @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 , that campaign may well have already begun			1
and if mr @entity0 sticks to his promise to serve a full five - year term , it will drag on until the beginning of 2020			1
i can hardly think of anything more likely to undermine and debilitate a future @entity147 government – especially one with a narrow or non-existent majority			0
and i firmly believe that at some stage in the next few years – and probably sooner rather than later – mr @entity0 will have cause to regret his decision			1
it is , of course , to his credit that , far from clinging to the baubles of office , he is already preparing for a dignified exit			0
but , only weeks before the most uncertain election in living memory , it was surely a mistake to telegraph his intentions as he did			2
and if mr @entity0 manages to retain power on may 7 , then i believe he will bitterly regret the casual manner in which he threw away so much of his authority .			1

@entity0 said he would not bid for a third term if he wins election
the pm said two terms were ' wonderful ' but three ' might just be too many '
if *re-elected* in may , he will serve a full five years but then quit @entity230
