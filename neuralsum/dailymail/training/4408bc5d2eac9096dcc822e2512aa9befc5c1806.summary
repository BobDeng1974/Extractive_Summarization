he called the attorney general ' a political hack looking to get publicity '			1
mr @entity7 said during group seminars he attended in @entity48 hotel conference rooms in 2009 and early 2010 , an instructor ' was flashing his @entity67 watch and wearing a very expensive suit and fancy cufflinks as he told us his rags - to - riches story '			1
' we followed powerpoint presentations , and they gave us loose - leaf manuals and websites you could pull up on your home computer			0
we were all scammed , ' mr @entity7 claimed			0

' it was an education that opened the door for us in real estate , ' @entity85 said			0
ms @entity85 and her husband paid $ 25,000 for a private three - day mentorship progam in @entity92 with a real estate expert chosen by @entity2 's organization			2
@entity95 is another student who has called the lawsuit baseless			0
after a free introductory presentation , the @entity98 resident spent $ 500 for an online tutorial offered by @entity2			2
' i got my value , and it was real value , ' mr @entity95 said , adding that he never felt pressured to pay or do any more than that			0
' i got my money 's worth , ' he added			0
complaint : @entity48 attorney general @entity47 brought the suit against @entity2 according to the lawsuit , some students in the initial three - day group seminar costing $ 1,495 were upset that they were pressured to take more expensive @entity2 ' @entity113 ' programs			1
when @entity115 asked for names of students who testified for the lawsuit , mr @entity47 's office provided only two - mr @entity7 's and mr @entity119 's			1
another student claiming the program failed to fulfill its promise of insider expertise is @entity125			0

mr @entity145 filed the suit on saturday , and @entity2 immediately shot back that it was false and politically motivated			1
mr @entity47 claimed many of the 5,000 students who paid up to $ 35,000 thought they would at least meet @entity2 but instead all they got was their picture taken in front of a life - size picture of him			1
' @entity22 engaged in deception at every stage of consumers ' advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm , ' @entity47 said			2
' @entity22 , with @entity2 's knowledge and participation , relied on @entity2 's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of consumers who believed in the @entity2 brand			1
' @entity167 officials told @entity2 to change the name of his enterprise years ago , saying it lacked a license and did n't meet the legal definitions of a university			1
in 2011 it was renamed the ' @entity175 ' , but it has since been dogged by complaints from consumers and a few civil lawsuits claiming it did n't fulfill its advertised claims			0
mr @entity47 's lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011 and it claims that students paid between $ 1,495 and $ 35,000 to learn from the mogul			2
he said the three - day seminars failed to teach consumers everything they needed to know about real estate , as the ' university ' had promised			2
the @entity22 manual tells instructors not to let consumers ' think three days will be enough to make them successful ' , mr @entity47 said			2
angered : @entity2 accused the attorney general of being politically motivated with his lawsuit and said it was a way for @entity47 to try to extort campaign contributions from him at the seminars , consumers were told about ' @entity200 ' mentorships that cost $ 10,000 to $ 35,000 in which students were promised individual instruction until they made their first deal			1
mr @entity47 said participants were urged to extend the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals , but then used the credit to pay for the @entity113 programs			2
the attorney general said the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised			1
the lawsuit added that many of students were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far worse off than before the lessons , facing thousands of dollars in debt			0
but @entity2 's attorney accused mr @entity47 of trying to extort campaign contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation			1

mr @entity224 insisted that @entity2 and his university never defrauded anyone			2

' this entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous waste of taxpayers ' money			1
' @entity237 records show @entity2 has spent more than $ 136,000 on @entity48 campaigns since 2010			0
