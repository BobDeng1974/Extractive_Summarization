a man serving 26 years for a murder he claims he did not commit could possibly be set free if one high - profile attorney has her way			2
@entity4 , of @entity5 , @entity6 , was convicted last year in the 2002 killing of @entity8 , even though a body was never found and the prosecution admitted he never laid a finger on his victim			1
now , lawyer @entity13 thinks she has evidence that wo n't only set @entity4 free , but also reveal who killed @entity8			2
@entity4 and @entity8 were both employees at @entity24 , the last place @entity8 was ever seen alive on december 20 , 2002			1
his blood was found in the produce cooler at the grocery store , but no one was ever arrested or charged with his murder or disappearance			1
then , a story began to circulate that @entity4 was dealing drugs , and had @entity8 working for him			2
people started to say he had the boy killed over a debt of $ 400 to $ 500 , including @entity8 's father			1
at this point the @entity38 was also investigating the death , but found no truth to any of these rumors			0
everything changed however in 2010 , when @entity44 , who also worked with the boys at @entity46 's , was arrested on cocaine charges			1
he told prosecutor @entity48 that @entity8 did owe @entity4 money and he was called in to ' take care of him			1
' @entity51 says he punched the 17 - year - old @entity52 and knocked him out , killing him			1
@entity4 then said he would take care of the body			0
new evidence suggest that @entity4 might be set free and so @entity4 was charged with first - degree murder with intimidation , while @entity51 received no charges as part of his plea bargain and a reduced sentence for his cocaine charge			1
@entity51 is now saying he lied and was coerced by @entity48			2
' i was following what [ @entity48 ] wanted me to say			0
they just wanted to close the case , ' @entity51 said			0
he also claimed that @entity48 was determined to charge one of the two boys with murder			0
' i was like , " if you , you know , you brought me into this			0
my family does n’t have money to pay for a lawyer			0
they do n’t have money to bond me out like yours does			0
" ' @entity51 said he told @entity4			2
“ ' you know , i ’m like , " they were trying to indict me for murder , " and i ’m like , " i did n’t have money to fight this case			0
" ' @entity51 , however , is not who @entity13 thinks killed @entity8 , but rather another young man working at the store with the boys - @entity88			1
@entity88 's fingerprint was found in @entity8 's blood splatter and one store employee , @entity92 , says he saw the two boys fighting over drug money on the night he died			1
' @entity8 had told @entity88 , " if you do n't have it by friday , it 's 60 , ” ' @entity92 recalled			1
' and to me , that meant , " if you do n't have the $ 30 you owe me for weed by friday , then it 's double			0
” ' old video shows @entity44 speaking with prosecutor @entity48 lamb now says he lied on the stand , and that @entity48 coerced him @entity88 was also missing for almost two hours that night , between 5 pm and 7 pm , which is when @entity8 disappeared			1
an employee later found underwear soiled with blood hidden in the ceiling of one of the store 's bathrooms , underwear that was never tested for dna or admitted as evidence in the trial			0
@entity13 is convinced that @entity115 will prove @entity88 was the killer			0
@entity88 did not testify in the first trial , and died of a heroin overdose before @entity4 's second trial			1
his first trial ended in a hung jury			0
' the only person that really dislikes @entity8 is @entity88			2
the only person … that owes money to @entity8 is @entity88 , ' @entity13 said			2
' the only person who 's ever described wanting to jump him with a weapon is @entity88 , and the only person in that back hallway is @entity88			0

@entity4 was arrested in 2010 for the 2002 murder of @entity8 , and charged with first degree murder by intimidation
the now *31* - year - old from @entity5 , @entity6 , was said to have had his friend @entity44 fight @entity8 over drug money he owed him
@entity51 has now said he lied at the urging of prosecutors about what happened
furthermore , the fingerprint of another man , @entity88 , was found in @entity8 's blood splatter
