@entity0 relieved some of the pressure on under - fire boss @entity3 as his second - half winner handed @entity5 a narrow 1 - 0 win over @entity7 at @entity8			1
the vultures have been circling @entity3 ever since his side slumped to a shock 3 - 2 defeat to part - time @entity13 on wednesday			1
but while his side again looked anything but assertive , @entity0 ' 58th - minute strike did hand the manager some much - needed breathing space			1
@entity5 midfielder @entity0 celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity7 @entity3 can still feel the sting of the @entity21 ' @entity20 semi-final but he has already insisted he will not walk away from the job until he leads the @entity25 giants back to the @entity26			1
but the fans who once idolised him during his days as a record - breaking frontman are quickly losing faith in his management			2
that was evident by the size of the 28,137 crowd - the lowest league attendance at @entity8 since @entity35 was just starting to make his mark as @entity38 boss in december 1986			1
despite such a woeful performance in midweek , @entity3 made just one change for @entity42 's first league visit to @entity8 since september 1970 - and even that was enforced as @entity0 replaced the injured @entity44			1
@entity5 ' @entity45 and @entity7 's @entity47 tussle for the ball @entity5 had plenty of decent possession in the first half but failed to make the most of it as time and again the final ball let them down			2
the first time they got in behind the @entity58 was after 11 minutes but @entity0 arrived too late to connect with a low cross swept in by @entity60			1
when they did carve @entity7 open , the men in blue seemed to suffer a collective rush of blood to the head			0
@entity60 's cushioned cut - back into the danger zone seemed perfect for @entity45 , but the striker got the ball caught under his feet			2
when it squirmed out to @entity72 , he crashed it onto the post when he should have netted			0
@entity60 was in again moments later but tried to be unselfish and square for @entity45			0
his generosity , though , only allowed @entity47 time to recover and then clear the danger			0
it was becoming another ragged display and the @entity8 crowd responded with an angry groan			1
a faint chant of " @entity3 " could be heard from one corner of the ground - but it was the one housing the @entity7 's supporters			1
@entity5 ' @entity85 climbs above the defence to direct a header at goal the groans developed into outright jeers as the home team trudged off at the interval			0
but within 13 minutes of the second period starting , @entity0 finally gave the @entity38 faithful something to cheer			1
a chipped ball by @entity96 up for @entity60 was nodded down perfectly into @entity0 ' path			1
the former @entity98 forward took a touch to set himself and then calmly rolled the ball past visiting keeper @entity102 for the opener			0
while @entity0 was enjoying his first start since the end of september , @entity45 was having another afternoon to forget			2
he had snatched at a couple of chances in the first period then missed an even easier one as @entity0 sent him through on goal , mishitting the ball when he had just @entity102 to beat			2
and he bore a frustrated look as he was replaced by @entity113 with 22 minutes left			0
by then , a deflated atmosphere had fallen over the stadium			0
but @entity116 had to act decisively to prevent another outburst of fury from the @entity5 fans as he beat @entity120 to a header just as it looked like the @entity124 striker was shaping to score			0
@entity60 was presented with his big chance to score as @entity96 picked him out in the box			0
but he needed an extra touch and found himself crowded out by @entity47 again			2
@entity5 should have added to their lead in the final few moments			0
@entity113 , though , headed over the bar , while @entity131 saw @entity102 pull off a fine save with the last kick of the game .			0

@entity0 ' 58th - minute strike handed manager @entity3 some much - needed breathing space
