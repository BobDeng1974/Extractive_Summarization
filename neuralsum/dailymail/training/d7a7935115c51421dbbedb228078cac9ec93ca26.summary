it wants to humiliate the firm , which uses a global network of sources to create daily intelligence briefings on security and financial risk , by publishing the communications			1
and it said they could provide the ' smoking gun for a number of crimes '			2

they were then used , it claimed , to donate $ 1 million to charity			2
activist @entity39 told @entity40 that , if the emails were published , the sources risked exposure			2
he said : ' people talking off the record to a think - tank are going to disclose a lot of information			2
their identities are likely to be in the emails			0
' both my grandfathers dropped bombs on people			0
i 'm not blowing up any villages			0
i want to not inconvenience or damage people but , if we do , i 'm not terribly worried about it			0
' we 're in a state of conflict with the government			0

' promising more : @entity9 recently hacked into think - tank @entity3 pictured above , and stole thousands of emails he said the emails could ' provide the smoking gun for a number of crimes of extraordinary importance ' and revealed @entity3 may have the opportunity to redact some of the communications			1
the threat to publish the emails mirrors that of @entity76 who leaked thousands of unredacted diplomatic cables earlier this year			0
a total of 1,195 @entity81 credit cards have been leaked			0
@entity9 boasted on monday of stealing @entity3 's confidential client list , which includes entities ranging from @entity84 to the @entity85 to the @entity86 , and mining it for more than 4,000 credit card numbers , passwords and home addresses			1
the hackers said @entity3 , based in @entity91 , @entity92 and who charges subscribers for its reports and analysis , were ' clueless ' when it came to database security			1
they taunted on a message on @entity100 : ' not so private and secret anymore ? ' before promising that the attack was just the beginning of a @entity12 - inspired assault on a long list of targets			0
@entity9 said the client list it had already posted was a small slice of the 200 gigabytes worth of plunder it stole from @entity3 and promised more leaks			1
it said it was able to get the credit card details in part because @entity3 did not bother encrypting them - an easy - to - avoid blunder which , if true , would be a major embarrassment for any security - related company			1
@entity119 , @entity3 's vice president of intelligence , said the company had reported the intrusion to law enforcement and was working with them on the investigation			1
and he added that @entity3 has protections in place meant to prevent such attacks			2
he said : ' but i think the hackers live in this kind of world where once they fixate on you or try to attack you it 's extraordinarily difficult to defend against			0
