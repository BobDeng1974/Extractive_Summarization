a new @entity0 : the debate will exercise the hearts and minds of voters in that country until next month 's referendum			1
it was also a question faced by a generation of @entity9 250 years ago			0
but they had to sail across the @entity11 to find their @entity0			1
disappearing act : @entity14 raises a glass to the joys and freedom of travel in @entity0 as the independence arguments raged - and as my husband and i yearned for traffic - free roads , trees and foodie treats - we booked a last - minute @entity27 flight to @entity28 , @entity0 's capital , and for a week toured parts of this isolated eastern peninsula of @entity31			1
over two - thirds of the province is covered by forest - conifers , of course , but maple , birch , oak and mountain ash too			1
@entity0 is also the world 's largest exporter of blueberries and @entity44 trees			1
@entity46 music is very much alive here and is one of the highlights of a visit ; another is the freshly cooked lobster ; yet another the whalewatching			0
in short , there 's a lot on offer			1
there 's certainly a lot of genealogy to discover			1
within five minutes of our arrival , the jolly doorman at @entity61 in @entity28 proudly told us that he was a quarter @entity64 and a quarter @entity65			0
he waxed lyrical about how thousands of @entity66 came over and mixed in with @entity64 , @entity67 and @entity68 to form the unique strain of folk known as @entity71			0
a haven in the @entity73 : @entity0 's capital @entity28 boasts a lovely waterside setting the major @entity65 influx to @entity0 began in 1773 , when the @entity76 sailed into @entity77 - acknowledged as the birthplace of @entity0			1
it 's an easy drive there from @entity28			1
an impressive full - size replica of the @entity76 was built in the town and is now in the harbour			2
many of the guides are descendants of families that came over on the @entity76			0
but it 's hard to believe such a small vessel made it across the @entity11			2
a walkabout below deck gets you wondering at the bravery and tenacity of those 200 early settlers			0
you can almost hear the melancholic notes of the pipes as you emerge blinking into the sunlight			0
from @entity77 we took a two - hour scenic drive to the luxurious golf - focused resort of @entity104 on the @entity105 , passing small marshy tidal inlets and gentle rolling farmland on the way			2
you do n't have to be obsessed with golf to stay here , but the gorgeous coastal panorama and the manicured course are enough to make you really want to learn			0
we chose to cycle and swim in the impressive 25 - metre pool			2
splendid sights : @entity14 encountered the @entity118 waterfalls ( left ) , and the @entity119 in @entity120 ( right ) we also went on wonderful walks on the beachfront and in the forests of the @entity124 , discovered the lovely local @entity126 wines , and slept like babies on down pillows in gigantic beds			2
unsurprisingly for a province called @entity0 , there are a fair few top golf courses			1
we drove for half a day to get to @entity120 in western @entity133 , in order to stay at the beautifully chic glass - fronted @entity136 golf course , and to tap our feet to @entity46 reels at the famous @entity138 @entity136 hugs the shore , and is recognised as one of the world 's greatest golf courses			1
the splendour of the place is truly appreciated from the @entity146 restaurant			0
we witnessed two sublime sunsets and enjoyed two lots of lobster - stuffed ravioli and blueberry cobblers			2
scenic , serene and scrumptious			0
we were very keen to cycle part of the @entity153			0
this 60 - mile well - kept coastal track stretches from @entity155 to @entity120 , and has been on my bucket list for some time			2
it is accessed just down the road from @entity136 , and is a pure pleasure to cycle			0
we went as far as @entity162 and back , breaking the journey with a late lunch at the @entity138 , which is owned by the folk - singing @entity166 sisters			2
both food and musicianship are second to none			0
@entity170 : the harbour at @entity77 has a replica of the @entity76 , which brought @entity65 immigrants to @entity0 we tucked in to crab dips with flatbreads and mussels and sweet potato chips , enjoying the heady combination of food , fun and fiddling , and staying far longer than we expected			1
we enjoyed sunny gin - clear skies while on @entity133 , so saved the indoor attractions till last , just in case the weather misbehaved			1
it did n't , so we rather rushed around must - visit attractions like the @entity187 and the @entity188 , where we helped weave a kilt			2
both places were entertaining and enjoyable and left us wondering whether we should have spent quite so much time at the splendid @entity192 ; or chatting with lobster fishers at @entity195 's lovely village market ; or loitering over breakfast with owner @entity197 at the @entity198			2
this place is a @entity133 gem , intimate and tranquil , and serving local products , such as fiddlehead fern soup and local cranberries and blueberries			2
the menu changes nightly and names all the food sources			0
our line - caught halibut was from @entity209 , about 50 miles away			0
the bread at breakfast was fresh from the oven			0
even the oatcakes were home - made			0
we left with a generous pile and munched away merrily on our journey to @entity217 on the @entity218			0
as we know her best : until recently , @entity14 had worked for @entity220 since 1990 @entity217 village is a charming living museum			1
it 's an actual village , though , superbly restored to its 19th century appearance and staffed by people in costume , portraying the experiences of the time			0
i rode a penny - farthing , got a recipe card from the printing press , watched wild rose hand - cream being made at the pharmacy , visited the telephone exchange , ate fresh - baked biscuits in the jailer 's kitchen and spun some wool at the weaver 's home			1
@entity242 , eat your heart out			0
this is the real deal , and that 's the thing about @entity0 : it is warm , accessible and authentic			1
scratch almost anyone and you 'll find a @entity249 or two in the family tree , a kilt or a fiddle in the closet			0
it 's as if a chunk of auld @entity0 has been broken off by ancient giants and hurled on to @entity31 's north - east coast			1
the land and soil look the same , the weather 's the same and you find the same hardy people			1
in some ways , it is more traditionally @entity65 than @entity0			1
if @entity267 loses the referendum , to ease his sorrows i 'd thoroughly recommend a trip to @entity133 , a dance along the @entity272 … and plenty of the island 's own single - malt whiskies			1
@entity277 ( @entity278 , 020 8742 1556 ) offers a seven - night package to @entity0 from £ 1,300 per person , including flights from @entity282 on @entity27 , car hire , two nights at the @entity284 in @entity28 , one night at the @entity285 , two nights at the @entity287 and two at the @entity289 , all room - only			1

long - serving weather *forecaster* has been at the centre of an ageism row
she has vanished from @entity220 's weather reports without formal *announcement*
she reports from @entity31 , where she has toured the sights of @entity0
