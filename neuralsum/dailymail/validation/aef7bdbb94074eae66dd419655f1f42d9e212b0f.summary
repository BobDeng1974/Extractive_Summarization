@entity0 refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of @entity2 national income on defence @entity0 infuriated @entity5 mps yesterday after he refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of @entity2 ’s national income on defence – despite a steep rise in the foreign aid budget			1
the chancellor dodged the question repeatedly during a post-budget interview , even though there is growing pressure from politicians and military chiefs			1
mr @entity0 refused four times to guarantee that he would meet the 2 per cent target in the next @entity18 , saying only : ‘ we are promising to keep our country safe			2
’ last night @entity5 mps , who have been campaigning to have the commitment enshrined in the @entity5 party manifesto , were enraged by the chancellor ’s response given escalating tensions with @entity26 and the rise of @entity28			1
they are particularly angry given that the government has committed itself to spending at least 0.7 per cent of gdp – currently around £ 12billion a year – on foreign aid			1
@entity5 mp sir @entity32 , a former defence minister , said : ‘ defence of the realm is the first duty of government and in these very dangerous times it seems to be inexplicable that the @entity5 party is unable to commit to maintaining the defence budget at 2 per cent in accordance with the @entity41 commitment			2
‘ it does n’t make sense , especially when we are just one miscalculation away from a possible @entity47 war			0
’ @entity5 mp @entity48 echoed added : ‘ two per cent should be a commitment in the @entity5 manifesto			2
it is a @entity41 target and we are now putting 0.7 per cent of national income into overseas aid			0
if you can do it for overseas aid then you can definitely do it for defence			0
’ the @entity59 warned that it would be impossible to meet such demands to protect defence spending without imposing huge cuts on other areas of spending such as policing , transport and energy – especially with health , schools and foreign aid already protected			1
economist @entity71 said that unprotected departments are already facing real terms budget cuts averaging 9.4 per cent by 2020			0
protecting defence spending at 2 per cent would mean that other departments would have to be slashed by 16.4 per cent			0
yesterday mr @entity0 told @entity78 ’s today programme that the @entity5 party was ‘ not proposing deeper cuts ’ to defence spending			1
but he failed to say whether the party would commit to the @entity41 target of 2 per cent			0
shadow chancellor @entity82 ( pictured with @entity0 ) waded into row saying the chancellor 's desire to get an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts to police and defence forces in years he said : ‘ we are helping in @entity91 , training @entity93 forces , our fighters are protecting the @entity95 , our military is doing a brilliant job in @entity98 , we are playing a global role			1
’ shadow chancellor @entity82 waded into the row yesterday , saying : ‘ his ( @entity0 ’s ) desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police , our defence forces than we ’ve seen in the last few years			1
’ @entity106 will give £ 20million to help former @entity108 countries fend off @entity26 aggression			2
the fund , drawn from the foreign aid budget , is based on a scheme set up by @entity113 to help @entity114 and @entity115 move towards democracy after the fall of the @entity118			0
@entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity93 all face @entity124 intimidation .			0
