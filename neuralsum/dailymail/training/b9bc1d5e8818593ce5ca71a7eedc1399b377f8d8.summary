@entity0 , social media manager at @entity1 , calls himself a ' web alchemist ' and ' aggressive engineer of perception ' on his @entity6 profile			1
his boasts will be taken in a very different light today as he emerged as a manager at the @entity1 social media team behind what has been branded the ' worst tweet of all time '			1
an employee sparked a firestorm on @entity15 yesterday after an extremely graphic picture of a woman engaged in a sex act with a model @entity20 was tweeted to a customer who complained about her @entity25 flight - and to its 418,000 followers			1
but for @entity0 it was n't the ' perception engineering ' he had in mind			0
while it is not yet known which employee was behind the monumental error , @entity0 apparently had some choice words for him or her			2
reacting today in the only way he would - on social media - he posted on @entity53 : ' whenever someone says : " i 'm sorry , it 's just who i am			1
" what they really mean is : " i am a giant a * * hole and have no plans of improving myself as a human " '			1
he has since deleted the message from his public profile			0
this was hours after he posted , in a huge understatement : ' i 've seen better days '			0
@entity0 , who works out of the airline 's headquarters in @entity70 , @entity71 , was unavailable for comment			1
but a spokesman for @entity1 ' partner @entity74 said @entity0 had no involvement with the incident and was not managing the team			1
the spokesman claimed the @entity53 messages were unrelated			0
the 30 - year - old , who says on @entity53 he is in an open relationship , went to @entity83 in @entity84 , and boasts on his @entity6 profile that he is the ' @entity86 ' and his responsibilities include being part of the @entity89			0
those skills will be sorely needed now			0
choice words : @entity0 reacts , appropriately on @entity53 , to the monumental error that has attracted all the wrong sort of attention to @entity1 captain of crunch time : @entity0 talks the language of the internet on his @entity6 profile @entity1 has had to profusely apologize for the mistake which has spawned a torrent of puns mocking the airline online			1
today , the airline said it will not fire the employee , adding that it was an ' honest mistake ' and and an ' attempt to flag the tweet as inappropriate '			2
' we captured it , flagged it as inappropriate , ' a spokesman for the airline said			0
' we are in the midst of reviewing our processes but for the most part we have an understanding of what happened and how to ensure how it wo n't happen in the future			0
' it all started when the image was initally posted to the @entity15 stream by a user			0
it was flagged as inappropriate by the team that manages their @entity15 account			2
but then a young woman , @entity128 , tweeted directly to @entity1 early on monday morning that her flight to @entity130 had been delayed - demanding ' free stuff ' because her vacation was off to a bad start			2
in reply , the airlines official @entity15 account replied , ' we do n’t like to hear this , @entity128			0
please provide feedback to our customer relations team here , ' and attached the explicit photograph of the nude woman out to its followers ' by accident '			0
@entity1 said : ' we apologize for an inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses			2
we ’ve removed the tweet and are investigating			0
' the tweet was deleted but spent 22 minutes online - enough time to cause a frenzy of sharing among incredulous users of the social media app. incredulous : the public 's reaction to @entity1 staggering tweet ranged from humor to sympathy for whoever was responsible the replies to the offensive tweet ranged from laughter to outrage			1
the image in question was attached to a tweet sent to @ @entity172 at 1:59pm , 30 minutes before @entity1 sent out a tweet with the same image attached			2
@entity74 and @entity1 use the same social media tool , @entity175			1
the timing was particularly amusing since it overlapped with the announcement of the @entity179 winners and gained more traffic online			0
the tweet is even more embarrassing for @entity1 as they prepare for their merger with @entity74 which will create the world 's largest airline company			1
help ! @entity0 boats he is part of the crisis response team at @entity1 do you know who is responsible for the social media faux pas at @entity1 ? please phone the @entity37 at 212 775 8126			1

@entity1 social media manager @entity0 reacted to the *humiliation* of tweet which caused a firestorm on @entity15
left red - faced after *pornographic* picture sent attached to replies about late flights to customers
the image and tweet was online for around 22 - minutes - but was shared *millions* of times when it was sent to 418,000 of the airline 's followers
@entity0 said on @entity53 : ' whenever someone says " i 'm sorry , it 's just who i am . " what they really mean is : " i am a giant a * * hole " '
@entity1 today said it will not fire the worker and denied @entity0 was the manager of the team involved or had any involvement with the situation
offensive image *originally* sent to @entity1 partner @entity74 in bad taste
it was *re-sent* to appalled customers in error after it was supposed to be marked ' inappropriate '
@entity1 has issued an apology and begun an investigation
do you know who is responsible for the social media faux pas at @entity1 ? please phone the @entity37 at 212 775 8126
