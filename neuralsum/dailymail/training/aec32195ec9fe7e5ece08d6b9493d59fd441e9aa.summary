by @entity0 it just goes to show that engraving jewellery is not just sentimental , but smart			0
a @entity4 couple have been reunited with the wedding they lost two years ago - and it 's all thanks to the message that was scrawled on the inside of the band			1
and @entity11 , of course			2
@entity13 was at @entity14 in @entity15 with her family when what she thought was a bottle cap that had washed up on the rocks was actually a ring			1
@entity15 couple @entity21 and @entity23 ( right ) were reunited with a wedding ring they lost at @entity14 two years ago , after @entity13 ( left ) found it washed ashore and put a photo on @entity11 the power of social media : it took just four days for @entity31 to track down the owner of this ring after she posted it on her @entity11 page the ring was lost here , at @entity14 in @entity4 , close to @entity37 , two years ago and found recently as she inspected it , @entity13 found an inscription that said ' @entity39 , my lobster '			1
she thought that meant it belonged to a fisherman , but either wat , it might be just be enough to try and find its rightful owner			2
@entity13 put a photo of the ring on @entity11 , which was subsequently shared over 25,000 times			1
one of the people that came across worked with a woman named @entity55			0
@entity21 knew straight away the ring belonged to her husband , @entity57 , because it was her message engraved on it			1
they had lost the band at the same beach two years prior			2
' i thought it was somewhere in the @entity63 , ' @entity57 told @entity64			0
' there 's no way , i thought after losing it , there 's no way it would come back on shore			0
' amazingly , the picture had only been on @entity11 four days before @entity55 came across it			2

' @entity85 resorted my faith in humanity , ' @entity57 said			0
' i was like wow , there are still honest good people out here like @entity31 , to be able to do the right thing			0
so it was pretty cool			0
' but hang on , what does ' my lobster ' mean ? turns out it is a nickname @entity21 and @entity57 have for each other , based on an episode of friends			1
