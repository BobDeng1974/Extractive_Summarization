@entity0 urged me to be more positive about @entity2 after my @entity4 column last week			1
i thought about it for a while , i considered @entity2 ’s worst ever showing at a @entity7 , and realised i did n’t have a clue what he was talking about at all			1
so i asked him to come on to my radio show and give me the reasons to be positive			0
it all went quiet from @entity0			2
of course there were positives – @entity18 did well , @entity19 showed flashes , @entity21 managed to score at a @entity7 ( i ’m scraping the barrel a bit here … )			1
it ’s not qualifying for a @entity7 they are judged on , it ’s what they do when they get there			2
i never expected @entity2 to win the tournament but i did n’t expect us to go out after two games			2
how can i be positive about that ? for @entity0 as an individual , the @entity47 connection granted him the incredible fortune to get an @entity2 reprieve and he took @entity52 ’s place in @entity26 , despite the @entity53 keeper turning up for all the qualifiers without a chance of playing			1
@entity0 kept a clean sheet in a dead rubber game against a @entity59 side who , once they realised @entity2 were n't intent on flying into challenges full force , barely got out of second gear			1
is that what he wants me to be positive about ? if so , well done @entity0 , but that ’s not what defines positivity for @entity2 at this @entity7			1
maybe he was out of the @entity2 loop a bit too long and just does n’t understand			2
game over : @entity2 crashed out of the @entity7 at the group stage positives : both @entity18 and @entity19 made a good impression in an @entity2 shirt for @entity0 , @entity2 was something he could opt in and out of			1
but for fans it ’s a lifetime commitment , and players should respect that a little bit more			0
for all the plaudits this @entity7 has had - some of us have admired the football played , and the attacking spirit of the games - it was still rubbish for @entity2 fans			1
i was in @entity88 for most of the tournament , and possibly got caught up in the moment			0
but upon my return to @entity2 i realised that for us to go out and come home so quickly was a total embarrassment , and to miss out on being a bigger part of this fantastic tournament in @entity26 is a huge disappointment			2
down and out : @entity98 looks dejected as @entity2 went out after three games i could say @entity2 played well and the games could have gone either way			0
but the truth is we had six months to prepare for @entity104 and @entity105 and we could n’t handle either of them			0
i said before the tournament i was not putting any pressure on the team , i only expected them not to embarrass us as they did in 2010			0
but going out after two games was an embarrassment			0
loyal supporters : @entity2 fans who travelled to @entity26 will feel let down by the performances i ’m happy to give @entity47 another crack at it though for @entity120 , i believe he will have learned from his mistakes			0
and the invitation to @entity0 to come on my show and tell me all the positives from @entity2 ’s @entity7 is still open			1
i am happy to be educated by him and i ’m disappointed he has so far bottled the chance			0
and there is a lesson to be learned from @entity0 ’s words – or lack of them			0
if @entity2 are going to turn failure into success , players will need to show courage when rising to a challenge			1
i hope the rest are made of stronger stuff .			0

@entity0 says critics should look at the positives of @entity2 's @entity7 campaign
players must realise being knocked out at the group stage is not good
@entity2 must show courage in the *future* and rise to challenges
