by @entity0 published : 18:09 est , 1 june 2013 updated : 18:09 est , 1 june 2013 support : sir @entity2 is behind @entity4 's theatreland on its stance over keeping its traditional lights actor sir @entity2 is backing a campaign to stop @entity8 pulling the plug on @entity11 ’s theatre lights			0
the star of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 has joined the fight to save playhouses from tough new @entity19 measures requiring them to do away with old - style lighting and install ‘ eco-friendly ’ systems instead			1
sir @entity2 urged @entity8 to rethink the crackdown amid fears it will ‘ ruin ’ the look of hit @entity4 shows such as @entity30 and @entity31			1
critics also say the move will threaten the survival of struggling amateur theatre companies which would not be able to afford new lights			0
the ‘ @entity8 ’ row centres on the @entity19 decision to phase out traditional tungsten incandescent light bulbs in favour of ‘ greener ’ led units			1
it is already illegal to import or manufacture the old - style bulbs , although people can use them while stocks last			0
but campaigners say the new led ( light emitting diode ) units are unsuitable for the stage			0
@entity52 , a lighting designer and co-ordinator of the campaign , said : ‘ of course , we all agree with moves to save the environment			1
' but telling people to use led units to light theatre productions is like telling @entity60 to swap his oil paints for felt - tip pens			0
in jeopardy : plays such as @entity31 at @entity65 would have their appearance ruined by the new lights ' led lighting can not yet replicate tungsten			2
' you could n’t have an led bulb in a bedside lamp in a period production or in a chandelier in a 19th century play – it would just look totally wrong			0
’ mr @entity52 fears many amateur theatre companies could go to the wall			2
he said : ‘ they ca n’t afford these changes			2
replacing an existing fitting may cost you £ 20 compared to £ 2,000 for an led			0
’ former @entity82 minister @entity81 said : ‘ a big mistake has been made that could have serious consequences for theatres			1
’ a spokesman for sir @entity2 said yesterday he was ‘ very happy ’ to lend his backing to the campaigners , who include lighting directors behind box - office successes such as the @entity93 , starring @entity94 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
hit show : the lighting director behind the @entity93 is campaigning against the new rules last night , the @entity98 insisted that theatres were free to continue to use tungsten lighting			2
a spokesman said : ‘ the regulation has specific provisions exempting the production and use of special lighting such as that used in theatres			1
’ however , campaigners say the exemption does not cover many of the lights needed for theatre productions .			0

@entity19 measures require theatres to install ‘ eco-friendly ’ lighting systems
