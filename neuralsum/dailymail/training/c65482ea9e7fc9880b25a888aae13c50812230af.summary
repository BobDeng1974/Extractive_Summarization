left - handed people have a ‘ strikingly higher ’ chance of suffering from schizophrenia , research suggests			1
a study revealed left - handers accounted for 40 per cent of those with the mental illness			1
however , only around 10 per cent of the general population is left - handed			1
famous left - handers : prince @entity9 , left , and @entity10			1
it is also seen as a sign of greatness it is thought that the changes in the brain that make people left - handed may also contribute to schizophrenia			1
famous left - handers include prince @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity19 , sir @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
left - handers are more likely to develop psychotic disorders , such as schizophrenia , than mood disorders , research suggests ( posed by model ) several @entity29 presidents have also written with their left hand , including @entity31 and @entity32			0
@entity33 is said to have been ambidextrous			0
four of the five original designers of the @entity36 computer were left - handed , as were one in four @entity39 astronauts			2
researcher @entity40 , of @entity41 , @entity29 , said : ‘ our results show a strikingly higher prevalence of left - handedness among patients presenting with psychotic disorders			0
’ in contrast , just 10 per cent of those being treated for bipolar disorder or depression were left - handed – a figure much more in line with the rate of left - handedness in the general population			1
@entity55 , a psychiatrist at @entity56 , said : ‘ this link between handedness and psychosis builds on previous work that seeks to understand how the development and connections within the brain help us better understand schizophrenia			0
that is an important prelude to developing better treatments			0
’ the study , published in the journal @entity69 , could also help remove some of the stigma surrounding the illness			0
professor @entity55 added : ‘ it also serves to highlight that severe psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia have a very real physical basis in the brain and body and are not just “ all in the mind ”			0
’ despite the link , most schizophrenics are not left - handed – and most people who are left - handed do not develop schizophrenia			2
independent minds ? mr @entity19 may be left - handed but @entity85 's first minister @entity84 , left , is not some argue that the dominance of lefties in the top is simply a coincidence and the numbers will even out over time			1
others claim left - handedness is associated with greater levels of creativity and skill - a disproportionate number of gifted artists , musicians and sportsmen are left - handed			2
or it could simply be that living in a right - handed world means left - handers get used to fighting for their rights from an early age			2
the proportion of left - handers in @entity108 as a whole has risen fourfold in the past 100 years			0
around 13 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women are now left - handed , compared to just 3 per cent of those born before 1910			1
experts say the rise can be partly explained by a growing acceptance of left - handedness			0
in the 18th and 19th centuries it was regarded as a handicap and teachers would try to beat it out of their pupils , or tie their hand behind their back to train them to use their ‘ correct ’ hand .			0
