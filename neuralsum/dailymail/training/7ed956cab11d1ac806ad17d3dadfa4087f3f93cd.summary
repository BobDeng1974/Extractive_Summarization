by @entity0 rebuttal : @entity4 , with his wife @entity2 , has had previous clashes with mps commons speaker @entity4 was yesterday accused of driving @entity8 ’s most senior official to resign by treating him badly and swearing at him			1
in an extraordinary intervention in the chamber , @entity10 mp @entity9 said that the @entity13 was retiring early after mr @entity4 used the f - word			1
the speaker immediately denied the allegation about sir @entity17 , saying : ‘ i ’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong			1
’ but mr @entity9 stood by the claim , declaring he does not believe things should be ‘ swept under the carpet ’			1
the @entity24 mp made the assertion under parliamentary privilege during a motion to mark sir @entity17 ’s retirement this summer after a 42 - year career in @entity8			1
it has previously been suggested that the 64 - year - old is leaving early because of a difficult relationship with mr @entity4			1
sir @entity17 , who has a £ 200,000 salary and grace - and - favour home , is the arbiter of the rules of debate			1
he sits at a desk facing the speaker ’s chair at part of every sitting in the @entity44			2
in his prepared speech , mr @entity9 told mps : ‘ our clerk is one of the most popular we have had and , certainly in my 23 years , i can say that ’s probably the case			1
‘ his cheerful disposition , often under difficult circumstances , has been an illumination to many of us and his detailed knowledge of procedure is important			0
' sir @entity58 is standing down as clerk of the @entity44 , ending a 42 - year parliamentary career he added : ‘ so this clerk will be sorely missed by the @entity62 and by me			0
we do n’t know why he has chosen to retire early , though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been easy , as those in the know have already alluded			1
’ the mp continued , spelling out the swear word : ‘ in that respect , despite sir @entity17 having studied @entity70 at @entity71 and being told at least once in front of others to @entity74 *			1
* off by you mr speaker , i think that would n’t have encouraged him to stay			1
’ last night , mr @entity9 , who is known as a flamboyant and often outspoken mp , defended his claim			1
‘ i got this from witnesses , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve heard of this type of thing happening more than once			0
a very well - known member of the @entity84 , with a capital “ e ” , was present and was very shocked			0
this is a knight of the shires , a very well - known person , but no one directly to do with the @entity44			0
‘ i asked him “ did he really say that ? ” i could n’t believe it			0
’ mr @entity9 was the last to be called in the motion and left the chamber after giving his speech			2
‘ i said it , then i left and bowed at him [ mr @entity4 ] as i left the chamber because i respect his position , if not him personally , ’ he said			2
‘ a number of colleagues came up and congratulated me and said it was a brave thing to do			0
a @entity103 mp said it was not the appropriate place to say it , but when i asked “ where was ” she could not answer			0
‘ i do believe these things should not be swept under the carpet			0
we know what happens when that occurs			0
’ @entity114 mp @entity9 claimed mr @entity4 had told sir @entity17 to ' f * * * off ' there have been previous confrontations between mr @entity9 and mr @entity4 , who had proved unpopular with some @entity114			1
the mp has claimed mr @entity4 does not treat him well in the chamber and will often call him last during debates			2
but yesterday mr @entity9 strongly denied making the comments to get back at the speaker			1
‘ this is not revenge at all , ’ he said			0
‘ i do not do revenge , that is far too childish			0
what i did took a lot of personal courage			0
’ last night , a spokesman for mr @entity4 said he did not have anything to add to his comments in the chamber			2
sir @entity17 became @entity13 in 2011 after a career which started in 1972			1
he is technically the legal owner of all the @entity62 ’s property , including @entity137			0
mps gave him a spontaneous round of applause when it was announced that he was retiring			0
during yesterday ’s motion , @entity62 sir @entity142 , the longest serving mp , warned that any speaker would be left ‘ hopelessly floundering ’ without the assistance of an expert clerk			2
mr @entity4 has aroused controversy by bringing in headhunters for an external search for a new head clerk as the role is usually filled by an existing official .			2

commons speaker accused of being difficult ' behind closed doors '
@entity138 line up to *express* *regret* at the early retirement of sir @entity17
@entity114 @entity9 says he was told ' in front of others to f * * * off '
@entity4 said the claim ' suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong '
