@entity0 has expressed his interest in becoming the new director of @entity3 following the sacking on wednesday of managing director @entity5			1
@entity0 , who played in a record 133 tests for @entity3 and is currently director of cricket at @entity9 , has not yet been approached by the @entity10			1
but he said : ‘ when @entity3 come calling , you should n’t say no. ’ the early bookies ’ favourite for the post is @entity15 , the former @entity3 captain who is close to the incoming @entity10 chairman @entity16 , and has also made clear his desire to help @entity19 cricket out of its current state of chaos			1
@entity0 stands at the @entity23 ahead of a @entity9 team photo shoot on thursday @entity0 lines up with @entity9 players for the team photo at the @entity23 test matches : 133 highest score : 190 runs : 8463 centuries : 15 half - centuries : 45 batting average : 39.54 @entity33 : 14 first test : @entity35 , @entity36 , feb 24 , ' 90 last test : @entity38 , @entity23 , sep 4 , ' 03 stats via @entity40 but @entity0 , who also spoke highly of the early impression @entity42 has made on his return to the @entity9 team , remains a respected figure in the game			1
and he is open to offers			2
asked whether he ’d be interested in the post – created by the @entity10 ’s new chief executive @entity49 , who confirmed @entity5 ’s demise wednesday evening – @entity0 said : ‘ i ca n’t just say yes until i know what the role and the responsibility are			1
but , of course , if it was the right role , you ’d be stupid not to look at it			2
‘ as a player i did just about anything that was asked of me			0
if they asked me to take on a role , and it ’s the right role , of course i ’d listen and have a big conversation – once the @entity10 have asked @entity9 permission to speak to me , of course , because i ’m under contract here			1
‘ i just want @entity3 to be the best side in the world			1
and if the @entity10 felt i was the right person to help take them to no 1 , then of course i ’d look at it			2
‘ i ’ve got a big job here , and that ’s what i ’m concentrating on			0
but at the same time you ’ve got to make yourself aware of other opportunities , and when @entity3 come calling , you should n’t say no. ‘ if they want someone with experience of being a director of cricket , then i ’d have thought i ’d be very close to being at the top of that list			2
’ @entity0 ( centre front ) poses in the @entity9 team photo ahead of the start of the @entity88 season @entity0 was a wicketkeeper - batsman for @entity3			1
here he looks on as @entity90 's @entity89 plays a shot towards @entity3 fielder @entity92 in the fifth test of an @entity95 clash at @entity96 in 1993 @entity0 is carried by team - mates @entity98 ( left ) and @entity99 , after playing his final test match , at the @entity23 in september 2003 against @entity38 but @entity0 made clear he ’d be interested in the job only if there was a clear definition of his accountability			1
‘ if you do well , you get patted on the back , if you do n’t do well , you get moved on			0
to me , it ’s straightforward			0
but if there are too many bits and pieces in the jigsaw , people can hide			0
‘ i ’m not one for hiding			0
it ’s about making tough decisions , and living and dying by those decisions			0
and making sure the players play without fear			0
’ @entity0 , who led @entity3 in 15 tests and scored nearly 8,500 runs , was effusive in his praise of @entity42 , whose chances of a surprise @entity3 recall increased from highly unlikely to merely improbable following the sacking of @entity127 – who in turn had sacked @entity42 over a year ago			1
@entity42 will feature for @entity0 's @entity9 outfit in this year 's county championships and the former wicket - keeper batsman believes the 34 - year - old could still make a comeback at international level ‘ we ’ve never had a problem with him , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i ’m sure other dressing - rooms may not say the same , but we do n’t have to handle him			2
‘ he fits in well			0
when he walked in , he went to his locker straightaway : it was like he ’d never been away			0
we can only speak in glowing terms of him			0
and that ’s how i judge people , is how i find them – not hearsay , or from other people			0
‘ @entity3 have said he ’s not on their radar			2
but you should never say never			0
if he ’s racking the runs up , and @entity3 are struggling , if the players are n’t getting runs or there ’s an injury to a batsman , and he ’s in top form – why would n’t you want to bring him back ? ’			1

@entity0 admits he would *happily* consider a role within @entity10
@entity3 would need permission from @entity9 before *contacting* @entity0
@entity163 wicketkeeper - batsman claims it would be silly not to listen to an offer
