his partner @entity24 filmed their daughter 's performance and posted the video on @entity7			1
but the next day she was asked to take it down by a teacher who appeared in the video			0
mr @entity0 , 30 , said ' my partner does n't usually post videos on @entity7			1
but some parents could n't go to the play because of work			0
a friend of ours could n't make it and we managed to catch her daughter in our video so she posted the video			1
' she was n't offending anybody but she was asked to remove it			0
we have removed it just in case they decided to take any further action			0
' i was very angry when she came back from the school and told me they wanted her to take it down from her personal profile			0
we should be allowed to share our daughter 's experience with other people if we want to			0
' the incident follows a number of disappointments for children who have seen nativity plays cancelled in recent years or their parents charged to watch			1
a spokesman for @entity68 council said schools do not want to spoil parents ' enjoyment of special occasions such as @entity74 concerts , but there were occasions when the protection of children is necessary , particularly due to the widespread nature of social media			1
he said at @entity2 some parents had specifically requested that the child 's images were not shared on social media			1
one group that campaigns for personal freedom called for ' common sense ' to be used and urged the school to stop behaving like ' @entity89 '			1
mother - of - four miss @entity24 , 33 , said she felt the school 's reaction had been extreme and that she did not understand it because its website has a picture of every child anyway			1
she said : ' it is absolutely outrageous and has been blown out of all proportion			0
' as far as i am concerned my parental rights have been taken away			0
' we were n't told specifically told by the school not to put up any videos but politely asked if we could refrain from doing so - but it certainly was n't an order			1
i never usually post videos - i only did it because a lot of parents had work commitments and could n't make the play			2
' one of the mum 's was really grateful i 'd posted it up and she thanked me because she had n't been able to make it			0
' miss @entity24 said she posted the video on monday evening and was told by teacher to remove it the next morning , when she dropped her daughter off at school			1
she added : ' it was then that her teacher told me she had been made aware of the video and asked me to remove it because she was in it - for just three seconds			2
proud mother @entity24 was told to take down a video of her daughter @entity4 as the nativity innkeeper miss @entity24 , pictured with her daughter @entity4 , said she felt the school had over reacted about the video ' she did not mention the children or child protection - if she had of course i would have removed it immediately			1
' ' my @entity7 settings are extremely protected and private - only my close friends can see anything i can post			2
' the whole thing is totally crazy - at the end of the day the school website has a picture of every child in the school and that is open to anyone to see			0
i really do n't know what all the fuss is about			0
' a spokesman for @entity68 council said schools needed the permission of all parents to allow filming or photography of their children in school			2
he said : ' if just one parent or carer objects to group photography , then the head teacher does not allow it to happen			0

miss @entity24 ( left ) was angry after she was told to remove the video of her daughter ( right ) in the school play mr @entity0 , 30 , said the couple believe they should be allow to share a video of their child if they wish to ' the headteacher made it clear to the audience that photography was allowed , but not for distribution on social media			1
' unfortunately a minority ignored those wishes and published them anyway			0
' there are children in our schools who are protected by means of court orders and under no circumstances can the identity or location of these children be revealed			0
to do so could expose them to unacceptable risk			0
' he said headteachers felt it was necessary to ban photography or filming of some events because they work closely with adoptive and foster carers to ensure the well - being and safeguarding of their children			2
@entity203 , from the @entity204 said that ' common sense ' was needed			2
he said : ' child protection is obviously a serious issue , however , some common sense is needed here			2
sharing a video of your child in a nativity play is a natural thing a proud parent does			0
' considering there is a photograph of every pupil on the school 's website , and miss @entity24 ' security settings on @entity7 are set to private , the school should stop behaving like @entity89 and allow other parents who could n't attend the nativity play a chance to share the experience			1
' the incident in @entity23 follows a number of disappointments for children who have seen nativity plays cancelled in recent years or their parents charged to watch			1
according to a @entity235 survey conducted earlier this month , just two in five schools allow parents and loved ones to take photographs freely at school plays			0
staff at @entity241 in @entity23 requested that miss @entity24 removed the video of her daughter at one in six , cameras are banned completely , while 14 per cent of schools video the performance then charge parents for copies			1
and a third of schools ask parents to sign forms stating they will not share snaps on social media , the survey said			1
one mother who responded to the survey online said that she agreed with photographs not being shared on social media , pointing to her own situation involving her adopted son			2
she said that if his photograph was to be posted on social media his birth parents might be able to determine his location - something , she argued , that would threaten his well - being			1
online advice issued by @entity270 states that adoptive parents should be wary of information posted on social media - by their family , and others			1
it states that ' without proper precautions children can be exposing details of their lives to anyone who logs on '			0
one school in @entity282 was today praised after it sent a letter to parents urging them not to post any photos taken at the school nativity on social networking sites			2
the letter , sent by @entity290 â€™s @entity289 , said it was a ' priority ' for children to be kept ' as safe as possible '			0
the letter stated : ' please could you ensure that you have not placed any photographs of @entity294 or @entity74 performances on to any social media websites including @entity7 , @entity297 or @entity298			1
' and the school , which was named best state school in the north - east by the 2014 sunday @entity303 publication last month , has the support of parents who agree with the message , according to @entity307			2
official guidance issued by the @entity309 states that parents should be able to take photos of their children at events such as school plays and sports days , without fear of breaching the @entity317			0
in 2010 , @entity318 , the information commissioner , urged parents of children appearing in plays and other school events to ' stand ready to challenge any schools or councils that say " @entity328 " to a bit of festive fun '			0
his comments came after one father , @entity330 , spoke out over being threatened with arrest when he notified a school that he wanted to take a photo of his daughter , then five , in her nativity in 2007			0
however , photographs are only exempt of the @entity317 if they are taken for personal use - to be put in a family photo album , for example			0
