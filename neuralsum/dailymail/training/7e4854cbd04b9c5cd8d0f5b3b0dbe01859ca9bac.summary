the @entity1 pump will inflate footballs and other sports equipment to precisely the right pressure from goal line monitoring technology to high - tech boots and cooling shirts , football has got smarter			1
now there ’s a pump called @entity1 that automatically inflates footballs and other sports equipment to precisely the right pressure , in a bid to boost athletes ’ performance and the quality of the game			1
the idea is that balls that are correctly inflated travel further and faster in a straighter line than balls that are under or over inflated			1
the @entity1 electric pump will work on the same principle as a pump used to inflate car tyres so users can set the desired @entity28 ( pounds per square inch ) , in order to keep balls at a specific hardness			1
the @entity34 - based inventors of the pump are raising money to put it into production on crowd funding website kickstarter			2
users begin by pushing in the electric pump ’s end cap in order to switch it on , which will reveal the needle , like a conventional pump			0
the needle can then be inserted into the ball ’s air valve			0
the pump will read the ball 's air pressure , displaying it on the device ’s screen , in either @entity53 - which is equal to the atmospheric pressure on @entity55 - or @entity28			1
users who select manual mode , can then raise or lower the pressure of the air inside a ball by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the pump and feeling how well the ball is inflated			2
the @entity1 electric pump will work on the same principle as a pump used to inflate car tyres so users can set the desired @entity28 ( pounds per square inch ) , in order to keep balls at a specific hardness			1
the device shows the pressure of a ball and buttons can be used to manually increase or decrease the @entity28 ( pictured ) what : smart ball pump that inflates or deflates balls to a precise pressure			1
function : three buttons allow balls to be inflated or deflated manually , or an automatic mode means equipment can be inflated to a set pressure			2
display : the pump ’s display shows a ball ’s current and target pressure in either @entity28 or @entity53			2
battery : the pump contains a lithium - ion battery that can be fully recharged in 90 minutes using a @entity95 connection			0
capacity : a full charge is enough to inflate 50 balls			1
or , they could type in the desired pressure and press the ' a ' button for the ball to inflate , or deflate to the desired hardness automatically , without the need for manual labour			2
the company said : ‘ the @entity1 smart ball pump makes every ball perfect so you can focus on your game			2
’ the electric pump contains a lithium - ion battery that can be recharged via a @entity95 cable			0
it can top up or inflate 50 balls , with one full charge , its inventors claim			1
they say it takes approximately 90 minutes to charge up fully			0
the pump is available to pre-order on @entity120 from £ 32 ( $ 49 ) , while the planned @entity121 will be £ 52 ( $ 80 )			1
the affordable pump is set to be of interest to many amateur players and coaches , because balls that are correctly inflated , travel further and faster in a straighter line than balls that are under or over inflated , improving the game the @entity130 in @entity131 was the most scientific and technologically advanced football tournament ever seen			1
from smart clothing that keeps players cool , to advanced boots that enhance speed and skill , no stone was left unturned in providing the best experience for audiences and players alike			0
@entity130 referees used a foam , water - based vanishing spray to mark out lines for a free kick , which disappeared shortly afterwards			0
the @entity130 in @entity131 was the most scientific and technologically advanced football tournament ever seen , and included products from smart clothing that kept players cool to advanced boots that enhanced speed and skill ( as illustrated in this graphic ) goal line technology was supplied by @entity152 company @entity151 , who used seven high - speed cameras at each goal mouth to monitor the action			0
used in every stadium , the system was able to tell the referee if a goal was scored within a second to an accuracy of 0.2 inches ( 0.5 centimetres ) , with the word ' goal ' transmitted to a watch on the referee 's wrist if the ball had crossed the line			0
smart boots also played a role in creating some memorable goals			0
@entity174 created the @entity176 boot , for example , which was sported by @entity179 star @entity178 and used a three - knit eave to put less material between the foot and the ball , enhancing the player 's touch			0
similarly , shirts were engineered to keep players cool in the stifling temperatures and a smart training ball by @entity190 helped players in training to provide analysis on their techniques via an app.			0

@entity1 pump is designed to inflate footballs to exactly the right pressure
device measures the pressure of a ball and the *psi* can be typed in
correctly inflated balls travel further and faster , improving sports games
the pump , designed in @entity34 , can inflate 50 footballs on one full charge
it is available to pre-order on @entity120 from £ 32 ( $ 49 )
