@entity0 hopes to turn his recovery from a ' freak ' neck injury into the start of his long quest for @entity7 2015 selection			1
the @entity9 hooker expects to be sidelined for 12 weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a prolapsed disc in his neck			1
the 27 - year - old will miss @entity15 ' autumn test schedule , but is steeling himself for a makeshift pre-season as he eyes @entity19 action			1
@entity9 and @entity15 hooker @entity0 is to see a neck specialist following an injury the @entity23 - born front - rower battled back from a first bout of neck surgery to make @entity27 squad , and is now aiming to make history repeat itself			1
' it was obviously frustrating but injuries are part and parcel of rugby , ' said @entity34			1
' it was just a freak injury towards the end of a scrummaging session in training to be honest			2
' i 've had it now : maybe that 's one way to look at it			2
' so i can get good rest , good rehab and conditioning , then the boys , some of the players will have a big couple of months of rugby leading into the @entity19 and what have you , while i 'll hopefully be fresh			0
' but you can never predict these things			0
' in the last @entity7 year , i had my neck operation in the january and thought i would n't be able to get back in contention for the @entity7			2
' but then some of the other boys started picking up injuries towards the end of the season and i ended up going to the @entity7			0
@entity34 ( left ) at the 2014/2015 @entity60 & @entity61 ' things happen for a reason but you 've got to look after your own health and wellbeing as well			2
' thankfully it is only just a 12 - week injury , so hopefully i 'll have chance to get back and try to get a bit of form to prove to the international selectors i deserve a spot			1
' it 's just part and parcel of rugby , you 've just got to make sure your body 's right and healthy , then look at the rest of it after that			0
' @entity34 described neck and back problems as par for rugby 's front - row course , playing down the ' light shave ' surgeons performed on his problem disc			1
the 26 - cap hooker believes the increasing media spotlight in rugby 's professional era accounts for a perceived rise in injury rates			1
' i do n't think there are more injuries , ' he said			0
' @entity7 's more scrutinised now , there 's more media interest , right across the board it 's highlighted more			0
' i would n't say there are any more injuries now than when i first started : you just hear about them			0
' when one or two players pick up several injuries on the bounce i think it makes things generally sound worse than they really are			0
' but we play a contact sport with big athletes playing it , and inevitably there are going to be some injuries			0
' something 's got to give at the end of the day - and it tends to be necks and shoulders ! '			2
