@entity0 , 30 , has been left with more than 50 tumours around his body after doctors dismissed his concerns about a mole on his back a teacher has been left with terminal cancer after doctors refused to remove a suspicious mole from his back for nine months			1
@entity0 , 30 , sought medical help after spotting the worrying blemish on his skin - but was repeatedly told there was nothing wrong			1
over the next six months , the spot started to bleed and crack but a dermatologist insisted it was benign			2
his gp finally agreed to remove the mole because of mr @entity0 's worries and sent off samples for routine analysis			1
within days the father - of - one 's worst fears were confirmed when hospital staff broke the news that he had skin cancer			1
the cancer has since spread to his brain , heart , adrenal glands and lymph nodes , leaving him with more than 50 tumours around his body			1
experts say spotting the disease as early as possible is key to surviving cancer but mr @entity0 , dad to a five - year - old son , @entity37 , says experts repeatedly botched his diagnosis			1
the maths teacher , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ' i started going to the doctor about a mole on my back in 2007			1
' my gp said they do n't remove them anymore and i was referred to a dermatologist at @entity50 [ in @entity41 ] who said there was nothing wrong with it and he would leave it and see how it went			1
' three months later all the original problems were still there			0
it kept bleeding and it was bleeding so often it would n't be long before there was a blood mark on my shirt and i would have to change			0
' this was happening every day			0
i was n't too worried - it was more annoying than anything else			2
' six months later the dermatologist said it seemed unchanged and it was all fine			2
' mr @entity0 was n't happy with the diagnosis and went back to his doctor , who once more referred him to a dermatologist			1
mr @entity0 shows the scar left from the removal of the original mole which doctors dismissed he said : ' i went back to my gp after nine months because i was n't happy and i wanted it taking off			1
' she referred me to the dermatologist again and he was quite insistent he was n't going to remove it			2
' it was black , raised , cracked and bleeding - you do n't have to be an expert in skin cancer to know something was n't right			1
' i was n't panicked at all			0
i just thought it was a case of getting rid of it			0
' my gp ended up removing it as a favour			2
they 're obliged to send it away for tests and a week later i had a phone call from the hospital in a complete state of panic			2
' i went in and was put in a room with a few people who were extremely apologetic , including a specialist cancer nurse and the dermatologist , who i have n't seen since			1
' at the time my son was being born so i just wanted anything that needed to happen to happen so i could get on with my life			0
' nine months after his original visit to the gp , mr @entity0 was finally admitted for surgery on his back			1
he said : ' they did the first operation and they were n't happy with the lesions and felt there was more they could have chopped out			0
' i had a second and then third operation			0
they kept having to open up the scar and search for more and more			0
' i went from being told there was nothing wrong to having this giant scar			1
in the following months i went for check ups but i felt they were quite brief and a bit useless			0
' a dermatologist at @entity41 's @entity50 said there was nothing wrong with the original mole after the three operations in 2007 to remove the infected tissue , mr @entity0 hoped he had beaten the disease , but in january last year he noticed some new lumps			1
by the time the results came back on april 15 last year it had reached his adrenal glands , which are at the top of the kidneys and his lymph nodes			2
figures show there are around 10,000 new cases of skin cancer every year and it 's the fastest growing cancer for 18 to 30 - year - olds			1
one in four diagnosed with melanoma , the most serious form of the disease , do not survive beyond five years			2
mr @entity0 's plight emerged after shock figures revealed that the number of new cases in @entity42 and @entity148 is double the @entity150 average			1
according to a new campaign from @entity152 ( @entity152 ) you are twice as likely to fall prey to the disease if you live in the two counties			2
but the heath group is urging anyone who spots anything strange on their skin to see their gp			0
@entity152 centre director , professor @entity164 , said : ' the campaign message is clear , if you notice any unusual or persistent changes to your skin , you should visit your doctor			2
' he was diagnosed as being stage 4 - which is terminal			1
mr @entity0 was given pneumotherapy , which he said was hailed as a ' wonder drug ' , but did n't well respond to the treatment			1
the @entity176 classics graduate added : ' i was going up to the hospital every three weeks for four months and being put on a drip			2
' even though it did n't work i felt well enough to carry on with my job and my day to day life			0
' they left me for two to three months to see how i was and after a scan they found the cancer had spread to my heart			1
' doctors told me it was untreatable and any treatment would leave a hole in my heart			1
they said the tumour was new and it had grown quickly			0
' i had a specialist heart scan and it found the tumour was n't new - it had been missed on previous scans and was actually treatable			1
' despite all this i was still well , but i became ill in february this year			0
i was behaving quite strangely and could n't do simple things like use my phone			0
' i found out i had 10 new brain tumours so the disease had progressed quite severely			1
' mr @entity0 is now taking @entity200 - the last of the licensed drugs he is able to take			1
if he does n't respond after six months he will try to take part in clinical trials to be able to use unlicensed treatments			2
he said : ' it is very toxic and does n't make you feel great			0
after this six months there is no more treatment			0
the best case scenario is that by the time i stop responding i would be put on a drug trial			0
' mr @entity0 is now urging anyone who sees something unusual on their skin to see their doctor			1
file photo he added : ' i would be very happy to take part in trials			0
they said i have between one and five years when i was diagnosed in april last year			0
' i 'm 30 and have a terminal illness - it 's all very well if you 're 70 but i was hoping for another 40 years of life ahead of me			1
' i did n't realise it would spread to where it has or so aggressively and quickly			0
' i was quite resentful to be honest - there 's a slight injustice in it			0
i know people are dying of cancer all over the world but when you 're 30 you think you have lots of time left			0
' there 's nothing i did to contribute to it			0
i did n't sun worship or get burnt			0
' i want people to know that skin cancer exists			0
i had a mole and i had it removed and i really thought that was as far as it would go			2
' i do n't want to be an anti-sun bed person and they 're not part of my story but if people could think twice about using them and use sun cream - whether it 's factor five or 50 - just think about it and use some protection			0
