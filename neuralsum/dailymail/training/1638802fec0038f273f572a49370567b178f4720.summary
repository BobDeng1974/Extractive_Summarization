by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 11:40 est , 12 october 2013 an aide to the @entity3 candidate running against @entity4 , @entity5 , mayor @entity6 for the state ’s vacant @entity8 seat has been fired after a profane rant questioning his rival ’s sexuality			1
@entity14 aide @entity13 was fired after an explicit tirade to @entity16 about mr @entity6 ’s unwillingness to ‘ take advantage of the perks of office ’ during interaction the @entity4 mayor had with a vegan stripped from @entity24 , concluding he tweets like ‘ a gay guy			1
’ published friday , the rant came after mr @entity13 was asked why he felt mr @entity14 was gaining in the polls against his more well - known rival			1
the misguided attack also saw the strategist compare mr @entity6 to disgraced former senators @entity31 and @entity33			2
misguided : @entity3 operative @entity13 's rant against @entity4 mayor @entity6 cost him his job mr @entity13 ’s first shots at the mayor were directed at his @entity40 exchange last month with the stripper			1
i mean , to me , you know , hey , if he said , ' hey , you got really hot breasts man , i 'd love to suck on them			0
' then like , yeah , cool			0
but like , he did n't say that , ’ mr @entity13 explained to @entity16			1
‘ it was like kind of like , i do n't know , it was like what a gay guy would say to a stripper , ’ mr @entity13 continued			1
‘ it 's the way he was talking to her			2
it 's just like like there was no sexual interest at all			2
’ the @entity14 aide then bragged that if he was single and a stripped was tweeting him , that he ‘ might take advantage of the perks of the office			1
’ they 've even met ! : mr @entity13 posted this picture , taken with @entity4 mayor @entity6 , to his @entity70 page mr @entity6 met stripper @entity71 while filming a still - unreleased documentary about @entity40 , according to @entity16			1
the @entity40 exchange between the two , which @entity75 made public last month , was brief and fairly innocuous			0
‘ and the @entity78 loves you and by the @entity78 , i mean me , ’ @entity6 wrote			0
‘ well now i 'm blushing : ) , ’ ms @entity71 replied			0
" its only fair , ’ @entity6 retorted			0
the faux - controversy soon blew over			0
a @entity6 adviser even joked that the real story was that a vegan strip club exists			0
she caught someone 's attention : mr @entity13 ridiculed mr @entity6 for not ' taking advantage of the perks of office ' after not taking things further with vegan stripper @entity71 the messages in question : this @entity40 exchange gave mr @entity13 fits , leading him to say mr @entity6 tweets like a ' gay man ' big fan : ms @entity71 's prolific appreciation of mr @entity6 via @entity40 shows up almost daily , she has even claimed to ' have dibs on first lady ' the mayor himself touted the @entity40 exchange as proof he is still ‘ engaging with people no matter what their profession , ’ @entity16 noted			1
remarking about the non-stop flood of naked pics posted to social media by the gregarious stripper , mr @entity14 gnashed his teeth over @entity6 ’s lack of interest			1
‘ i do n't know who she is			0
i do n't know anything about her			0
' get the f * * k out of here dude , ’ mr @entity13 ranted			1
‘ you ca n't follow her @entity40 page and not know she 's got those great breasts			0
how do you f * * * * * g not know ? ’ ‘ who does this guy really want to work for ? who 's he representing ? ’ mr @entity13 wondered aloud			1
the unhinged aide also questioned the frontrunner ’s willingness to allow speculation over his sexuality to continue , his fondness for pedicures and @entity132 fundraisers			2
you 're fired ! : @entity14 immediately fired mr @entity13 and apologized for his remarks ‘ i love seeing on @entity40 when someone says i ’m gay , and i say , ‘ so what does it matter if i am ? so be it , ’ mr @entity6 said earlier this year			1
‘ i hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that i ’m straight			0
’ the soon - to - be - fired aide ’s rant began to finish up after he compared mr @entity141 to former senators @entity31 and @entity33			1
mr @entity31 ’s political career came to a screeching halt after he was busted in an airport sex sting trying to solicit sex in a men ’s bathroom , infamously tapping his foot on the ground between stalls			2
mr @entity33 ’s numerous affairs , most notably with @entity150 , brought a disastrous end to his 1988 presidential candidacy			0
no comment : mr @entity6 has not publicly remarked on mr @entity13 's comments finally satisfied he had exorcised all of the @entity6 demons from his system , mr @entity13 touted his candidates ‘ surging ’ place in the polls			1
mr @entity14 fired him almost immediately after the article was published friday afternoon , and publicly apologized for his comments			2
mr @entity6 has not publicly addressed the incendiary comments			0
neither he , nor his campaign could be reached by @entity166			0
