a quarter of children in @entity5 are living in poverty , a controversial report by a @entity2 agency claimed yesterday			1
millions ‘ have fallen prey to the dangers of austerity ’ during the recession years , @entity7 said			2
@entity5 was even ranked 25th on a child poverty league table of 41 developed countries – below @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the proportion of children in poverty is higher in the @entity5 than in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 or @entity22 however , critics last night described a measurement that assesses children in the @entity5 as worse off than those in @entity27 as ‘ worthless ’			1
they said @entity7 was using distorted measures to paint a false picture of the real levels of poverty in @entity5			1
calculations are relative to average income – so @entity5 appears to be worse than countries where most people are poor , because average incomes in the @entity5 are higher			1
in the latest of a succession of highly critical reports about @entity5 by @entity2 agencies , @entity7 said child poverty in the @entity5 increased by 1.6 percentage points between 2008 and 2012 to 25.6 per cent			1
topping a table of countries deemed to have best protected children during the recession was @entity15 , where child poverty was said to have dropped by 8.6 points			1
@entity7 attacked the government 's cuts to benefits for contributing to a rise in child poverty since 2008 policy : @entity52 is behind the report the @entity2 official behind the children of the recession report is @entity7 director of policy and strategy @entity57			1
the @entity60 has spent his career working for the @entity2 and other global organisations			0
mr @entity57 is an active user of @entity63 , which he uses to publicise not only the @entity2 agency ’s activities but his other interests , which include campaigning against climate change , and supporting the @entity69 , which wants to see drug abuse decriminalised			0
before joining @entity7 mr @entity57 spent 20 years working for @entity72 and @entity72 campaign groups			0
for 11 years he ran the @entity73 , which is claimed to be ‘ the world ’s largest international development non-governmental organisation specialising in @entity72 ’			0
he then moved to the @entity76 , an agency which has also provoked controversy in @entity5			2
in 2011 it published a ‘ human development index ’ that put @entity5 in 28th place , below recession - ravaged @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
mr @entity57 took over the policy role at @entity7 in 2012			0
in @entity13 , in 12th place , child poverty fell 2.3 points , while the measure dropped by 0.6 in 20th - placed @entity14			1
the children of the recession report said many affluent countries had suffered a ‘ great leap backwards ’ in terms of household income			1
@entity57 , @entity7 ’s head of global policy and strategy , added : ‘ the impact on children will have long - lasting repercussions for them and their communities			2
‘ all countries need strong social safety nets to protect children in bad times and in good – and wealthy countries should lead by example , explicitly committing to eradicate child poverty , developing policies to offset economic downturns , and making child well - being a top priority			1
’ @entity7 ’s use of ‘ relative poverty ’ in its report is unpopular in @entity5			1
work and pensions secretary @entity115 has been trying to stop @entity116 using such measurements because they are seen by many to record levels of inequality , rather than poverty			0
relative poverty counts people as poor if they live on an income below a poverty line , set at 60 per cent of median income			0
but if the median income in a country rises , so do the number of people who appear to be in ‘ poverty ’			0
conversely , if everyone is poor , but median incomes are low , it will suggest fewer people in poverty			0
however , critics condemned the methods used by the @entity2 agency to arrive at its figures			0
@entity142 , former chief of the @entity144 think - tank , described the findings as ‘ worthless ’ and said @entity7 should be using measures of ‘ real deprivation ’			0
a source close to work and pensions secretary @entity115 said @entity7 is using ‘ out of date statistics ’ and said national data showed that around 300,000 fewer children are now in poverty			2
in another unflattering table of national comparisons , yesterday ’s report also highlighted @entity5 ’s ‘ neets ’ – young people who are not in employment , education or training			2
@entity7 found that @entity160 rose from 12.1 per cent in 2008 to 13.3 per cent in 2012 , placing the @entity5 14th out of 41 on the league table – below @entity162 and @entity163			1
‘ many will suffer the consequences for life , ’ the report said			0
in fact @entity162 has more than doubled the percentage of @entity170 aged 15 to 24 compared to @entity5 , and @entity163 close to double			2
but by looking at relative changes in the years 2008 to 2012 , @entity7 put both countries higher in its league table			2
the report said @entity5 should ‘ review ’ its economic policies as a ‘ priority ’ and raise working tax credit , increase benefits in line with inflation , and push up the minimum wage for under 21s			1
other @entity2 reports have criticised @entity5			2
last year the @entity2 ’s special rapporteur on adequate housing , @entity188 @entity187 , angered @entity190 politicians when she demanded the abolition of the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’			0
and @entity194 official @entity193 claimed that sexism in @entity5 is worse than elsewhere and that public spending cuts were making things worse			1
bad parents should be given government classes on how to cuddle their children , according to a major new report published last week			0
politicians have been reluctant to ‘ call out ’ bad parenting , despite this having a bigger impact children than money or schooling , the former @entity203 minister @entity202 said			0
mr @entity202 , who was brought in by @entity210 as the government ’s social mobility @entity213 , attacked mps for being ‘ tentative and timid ’ about bad parenting			0
deputy prime minister @entity215 ( left ) has attacked the @entity216 for blocking the introduction of ‘ meaningful ’ new child poverty targets following @entity202 's report into social mobility child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s , the @entity221 warned last week			1
it said @entity5 is at risk of becoming a place where ' children 's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate , parallel worlds			1
' it found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s			2
he called for a national parenting campaign , funded by cutting childcare tax breaks from families with at least one parent earning more than £ 100,000 a year			0
mr @entity202 ’s report also calls for the best teachers to be paid more to work in deprived areas , action to close the gap in gcse results between rich and poor youngsters and for universities to admit 5,000 more students from disadvantaged backgrounds by 2020			0
it also says that unpaid internships should be made illegal , and that the ‘ living wage ’ should be introduced by 2025			0
the recommendations come amid warnings that the generation of workers will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless ' urgent action ' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment			0
mr @entity202 said the @entity5 was at risk of becoming a ‘ permanently divided ’ nation , with the poorest in society left behind			2
it says that the country is likely to see an unprecedented rise in child poverty over the next decade , amid the biting impact of welfare cuts and low pay .			1
