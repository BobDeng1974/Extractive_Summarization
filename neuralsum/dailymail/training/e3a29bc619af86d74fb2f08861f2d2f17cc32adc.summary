spies around the world could soon be able to listen in on secret conversations without any fear of being found out thanks to the first ever one - way sound machine			1
sound waves traditionally travel forward before bouncing back , and with sound this means you can speak , hear yourself speak , and hear any responses			1
called an acoustic circulator , the first - of - its - kind system uses fans to change the flow of air as the sound waves travel through it , and this prevents the waves from bouncing back			1
the arrows show how sound waves flow from one port , to the next , in sequence , and never bounce back			1
the circulator is the first - ever one - way sound machine the circulator was created by a team of researchers in the @entity34 at @entity35 led by professor @entity36			1
@entity36 said his experiments successfully prove that the ' fundamental symmetry with which acoustic waves travel through air between two points in space - for example , if you can hear , you can also be heard - can be broken by a compact and simple device '			1
the inspiration for the device came from current three - port electronic circulators that are typically used in communication devices and radars			1
for example , microwaves and radio signals are able to move from one port to the next in sequence , meaning they 're never sent back to the recipient			1
in the middle of the team ’s acoustic circulator is a ' resonant ring cavity ' fitted with three small computer fans ( pictured right )			1
these fans circulate and keep the airflow travelling at a specific velocity			0
the ring is connected to three ports , each with a microphone fitted to the end that can record sound			0
during professor @entity36 ’s experiment , researchers sent sound from one port to another			0
when the fans were turned off , the sound signal from @entity79 split in half and travelled through the two other ports , @entity77 , as expected - known as ‘ transmission symmetry ’			2
however , when the researchers turned the fans on and delivered a moderate airflow into the ring , with specific velocity tailored to the ring design , transmission symmetry was broken and the signal from @entity79 would flow into @entity77 , leaving @entity77 3 isolated			0
similarly , when a signal was sent from @entity77 , it would flow into @entity90 , leaving @entity77 1 isolated , and so on			0
the sound waves continued to move through the ports in sequence , and never travelled in the opposite direction or bounced back			1
in these electronic circulators , when one of the ports is n’t being used , the system acts as an isolator , letting signals to flow from one port to the other , but not back			2
the @entity35 team realised the same principles could apply from sound waves traveling in air , which led to the team 's building of a first - of - its - kind three - port acoustic circulator			1
' using the proposed concept , we were able to create one - way communication for sound traveling through air , ' said professor @entity36			2
' imagine being able to listen without having to worry about being heard in return			0
‘ it is just the right spin of fluid ( air ) coupled with the strong resonance of our ring cavity , which makes our design powerful			0
' to test the circulator , researchers sent sound from one port , pictured , to another			2
when the fans were turned off , the signal from @entity79 split and travelled through the two other ports - known as transmission symmetry			0
however , when the researchers turned the fans on transmission symmetry was broken ' these two combined mechanisms create strong nonreciprocity in a compact device			0
sound waves are routed in one direction only - always contrary to the direction of the airflow			2
' the findings , @entity138 and @entity139 in a @entity140 , are published the journal @entity142			0
this research may eventually create an ‘ acoustical version of one - way glass , ’ said @entity146 , acoustics expert and associate professor in the @entity148			0
‘ it also opens up avenues for very efficient sound isolation and interesting new concepts for active control of sound isolators			0
' the researchers are now working on using these concepts to create nonreciprocal circulators and isolators for radio waves and light , as well as a design for the sound circulator that does not use moving parts .			2

the one - way sound machine is called an acoustic circulator
waves traditionally travel forward before reversing and bouncing back
with sound , this lets you speak , hear yourself speak , and hear responses
the circulator chambers move waves through its three - port *formation*
fans change the flow of air and stop the sounds from bouncing back
*scientists* in @entity35 claim it works in a similar way to one - way glass
