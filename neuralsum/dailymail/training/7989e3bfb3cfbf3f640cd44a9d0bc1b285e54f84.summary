by @entity0 @entity1 , 67 , is reported to be under house arrested charged with funding foreign political parties the mayor of @entity5 is among 35 people arrested after a multi-billion pound project to stop the city from flooding was hit by an anti-corruption probe			1
mayor @entity1 , 67 , is under house arrest , accused of illegally financing political parties			1
authorities say 20million euros ( £ 16million ) was diverted to overseas bank accounts and used to fund foreign parties			1
according to the @entity16 , the corruption took place during the tender process to build the so - called @entity20 barriers			2
the £ 4billion @entity20 project involves building more than a mile of barriers to seal off @entity23 in the event of high tides or flooding			1
the project was first put forward in 1966 but the barriers only started being built 11 years ago , and the first was installed last year after delays and financial problems during @entity32 's economic crash			0
@entity32 financial police confirmed that @entity1 had been arrested and the @entity35 news agency said he was being investigated for alleged corruption , extortion and money laundering			1
prosecutors @entity39 and @entity41 said : ' the investigation shows that a great portion of the funds was used to finance political forces at the city , regional and national level , and corrupt high - level public officials			2
' a spokeswoman for the @entity5 city government had no immediate comment , and centre - left mayor @entity1 's spokesman did not respond to phone calls			2
the arrests were the result of a three - year investigation that led to the arrest last summer of the head of the consortium building the ambitious but long - delayed system of so - called @entity20 barriers			0
it is the latest in a series of @entity32 bribery investigations involving high - profile public works projects			0
a series of unrelated corruption investigations , mostly involving bribery or embezzlement accusations , have implicated former high - ranking government ministers in recent months			0
the £ 4billion @entity20 project involves around a mile of barriers being built to seal off three entrances to the lagoon in the event of high tides and flooding investigations have revolved around some of the biggest @entity32 public works projects including the @entity84 world 's fair , @entity82 , and an @entity32 - funded water project in @entity86			1
most recently , a former interior minister was accused of helping a businessman flee @entity32 to escape a @entity90 association sentence			0
the string of arrests has prompted comparisons to the @entity95 anti-corruption investigations of the 1990s that toppled an entire political class			0
the one clear difference this time is that the alleged bribery involves individuals from across the political spectrum rather than political parties enriching themselves			1
the latest arrests put more pressure on premier @entity106 to take action , after his appointment of an anti-corruption czar earlier this year			0
over the weekend , the @entity110 flagged the deep - rooted problem of corruption as an issue hampering investment and economic renewal in @entity32 , which ranked 69th in @entity117 's perceived level of public sector corruption last year - behind @entity119 and just ahead of @entity120 .			0
