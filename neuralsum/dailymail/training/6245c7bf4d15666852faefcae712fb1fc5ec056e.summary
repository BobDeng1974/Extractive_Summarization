by @entity0 as the inimitable @entity1 in @entity2 , she was memorably dumped at the altar by @entity4			1
' when i die my obituary will probably be " @entity1 dies " , ' admits the actress in a short film she 's made with @entity9 in which she models one of its latest collections			1
however , her new role in season five of @entity13 might soon shake up the public 's perception			1
we shall have to wait until september to find out if @entity17 captures our imaginations in the same way as her breakthrough role in @entity22			1
clearly keen to tap into her very @entity24 appeal , @entity9 has snapped the actress in the quintessential seaside town , @entity28 , for its @entity30 section			1
@entity38 , from £ 6.99 , @entity39 , £ 49.50 @entity34 , 49 , is the perfect poster girl for @entity9 ' range of cosy knits , polka - dot blouses and tailored blazers			1
clearly throwing herself into her latest venture , the actress can be seen frolicking on a @entity24 beach and even jumps into the sea in the new imagery			1
down - to - earth she might be , but @entity34 comes from illustrious stock : she 's the granddaughter of the 4th @entity53 , her uncle is one - time spectator editor @entity54 and her ­ sister ­ @entity56 was formerly ­ married to acerbic writer @entity57			1
speaking about her well - connected family , she said : ' i am related to a prime minister , @entity61 and @entity62 was my great aunt , though going back eight generations			1
my parents came from quite an aristocratic background			1
but how that has affected me ? it ’s difficult to say			2
' you are what you are are n’t you ? genetically i suppose it has given me certain qualities but then it ’s difficult to know which qualities came from whom , because of course by this stage it ’s just stories - they were n’t anybody i actually knew			2
' @entity62 , i ’m obviously very proud to be related to her			2
she was a famously good aunt , did n’t have any children herself but was very keen on her nephews and nieces so if i ’m feeling a bit stressed or feeling that things are n’t going very well , i ’m like " are you looking out for me , i hope you are looking out for me			2
" @entity89 style : @entity34 , 49 , is the perfect poster girl for the range of cosy knits , polka - dot blouses and linen blazers @entity34 , who stays in shape by swimming , can be seen splashing around in the sea in the new imagery ' otherwise , maybe i was a bit rebellious about my background			1
maybe i ’ve embraced it on some levels - and probably a lot my acting skills and my ability with language is inherited			2
' my father is very articulate and funny and probably would have made a good actor – there are quite a few hidden theatrical people in my family who were n’t actually actors but probably would have been quite good ! ' speaking about her family - her parents divorced and married other partners , so she has step - siblings - she said : ' it was chaotic , we were outdoors a lot and rode a lot - very privileged but i think it was difficult at times because we were quite wild , that ’s for sure			2
@entity34 went to a convent school and says she was one of those people who found learning ' very difficult			1
' ' i think i had learning difficulties actually , in fact , a lot of actors do find that they ’re not that academic or intellectual			2
i often play parts where you would have had to have a very good education , a lawyer , doctor things like that - but i never could have been that in my own life			2
i could hardly get an o level			2
i was basically thick , ' she said			2
colourful history : speaking about her family she said : ' it was chaotic			2
we were quite crazy ' @entity141 , £ 39.50 she adds that she was ' incredibly lucky ' to have found acting ; otherwise she could have felt that she was an underachiever			1
' i feel i should be able to tell people that it is possible , to earn a living doing something you love - it ’s a great privilege and if you have that you should be very grateful			2
' reminiscing on starting out as an actress at the age of 18 , she explains how she ' fell into ' becoming a naked artist ’s model to earn a bit of money			0
' i was n’t physically shy , ' she said			0
' i ’d turn up and they ’d say " will you take your clothes off " and i ’d think it was fine			0
i guess coming from the country side i was never self - conscious			0
so that was how i earned a living when i should have been at school ! '			0
@entity34 had a baby , @entity165 , who was the somewhat unexpected result of a romance the actress had at drama school with cult poet @entity170 at the age of 21			1
she admits that everything looked like it was going to go ' tits up ' and ' disastrously wrong ' at the time			0
beach babe : @entity34 worked as a naked artist 's model when she was younger as a way to make money when she first moved to @entity179 she said : ' i think one of the hardest things about having a child is who is going to look after them when you ’re working			1
and i was lucky because my mum would take her			0
but when you ’re acting you get up very early , you could leave for work at 5am and if you ’re a single mum , which i was at times , not always , you would have to think who would take @entity165 and maybe drop her off somewhere the night before			0
' so it was n’t easy for @entity165 or me , she did n’t have know that mum would pick her up all time - but i was very lucky because i was very unsuccessful and very unemployed , so actually , i was around a lot ! ' working mother : @entity34 , who had a baby when she was 21 , said one of the hardest things about having a child is who is going to look after them when you 're working - she was lucky to have her own mother on hand to help			1
skirt £ 22.50 @entity34 , who describes her personal style as ' scruffy ' , ca n't speak highly enough about her best friend and daughter @entity165			1
she said : ' i feel that it was one of life ’s incredible coincidences that i happened to have a child that i love			0
of course i love my child , but we just really click			0
' i always found her so funny , witty , even when she was young she would say things and i ’d think that ’s actually really funny - you ’re a genuine wit			0
she ’s a wonderful person and we have so much in common			0
' so of course you can love your child very much but find you do n’t have anything in common - for either of you , but we can go to galleries and do things together - go for walks , we love animals - we ’ve got a lot in common and that ’s just a coincidence i think			0
' she also says she has been ' incredibly lucky ' to have shared 16 years of her life with her husband , @entity225 - born former minicab driver @entity224 , who is seven years her junior			1
' i was mad about him , ' she reminisces			0
' it ’s very sweet actually , very romantic and we ’ve been together a long time			0
' we lead quite separate lives , he ’s busy and i ’m busy - we come and go			0
despite her enduring success , @entity34 is modest and does n't believe that she has all the qualities of a leading lady			1
' they always seem to think i ’m more the dominatrix , the stalker , the nutter or the evil , ' she said			0
fit and fabulous : revealing her secrets to looking good , @entity34 says she tries to swim every day as she 's so bored of the gym			1
@entity242 , £ 29.50 ' i was always a character actress , i suppose			1
i think it ’s a bit more fun – although sometimes it ’s quite narrow the view that they see the heroine as			0
' her most defining role has to be alongside @entity4 in @entity22 , of which she laughs : ' when i was in four weddings i did n’t realise that @entity1 was my name - i thought it was @entity257 so it took me ages to accept that @entity1 was my actual , official name			1
when i die my obituary will probably be " @entity1 dies "			0
' what can i say about that – do i mind ? no. ' revealing her secrets to looking good at almost fifty , @entity34 says she tries to swim every day and that she 's so bored of the gym			1
' i hate being told i have to do 50 of this and 20 of that , by then i ’m literally praying			0
i become a @entity269 and revert to my roots , praying to the @entity271 for it to end			0
i ca n’t take any more of it			0
i just ca n’t do exercise in that form , but swimming is different			0
' and when i come out i ca n’t be bothered to get dressed so i put on my dressing gown and get in my car , or sometimes i walk back home in my towelling dressing gown and i think everyone will see @entity1 and think i ’m a nutter , ' she said			0
remember when ? @entity34 as the inimitable @entity1 in @entity286 , where she was memorably dumped by @entity4 at the altar leading roles : @entity34 as miss @entity289 , left , and as @entity292 in @entity293 's @entity291 , right			1
