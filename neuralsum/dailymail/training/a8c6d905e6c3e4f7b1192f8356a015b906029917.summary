by @entity0 published : 09:07 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 02:29 est , 12 june 2012 a four - year - old boy who went into hospital to have his tonsils out died after drowning in his own blood as a result of a 15,000 - to - one complication , an inquest heard			1
@entity8 seemed to be recovering well after the routine operation at his local hospital in @entity11 , @entity12 , and was sent home			1
but six days after the surgery , he began losing large amounts of blood during breakfast and his terrified parents paramedics @entity18 and @entity20 called an ambulance			2
doctors at the same hospital were unable to save @entity8 , who had suffered cardio - respiratory failure when his lungs filled up after a ' catastrophic bleed ' from a tiny artery			1
procedure : @entity8 had seemed to be recovering well after the routine operation at @entity30 in @entity11 the inquest heard that @entity8 had been back to hospital with a temperature and with low blood oxygen levels but was discharged again , with no indication of what was to come			1
coroner @entity37 told his grieving mother and father : ' i have heard what happened that day			2
he seemed ok and suddenly , during breakfast , he had this catastrophic bleed			1
' what happened then will always be with you			2
i feel so sorry for you because it must have been absolutely awful			2
' clinicians had recommended surgery for the youngster because he suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea , where his pronounced adenoids and tonsils made it hard for him to breathe , especially at night			1
dr @entity55 said the operation on the boy 's tonsils was one of three similar ones on the day , and that he had carried out 142 of the procedures in the @entity62 and about 40 more in his native @entity63			2
he used a bipolar diathermy , which uses a low electrical current to heat a concentrated area of tissue to cauterise arteries and veins to stop bleeding			0
he also tried to attach ties as an added measure but could only manage it on one of them , despite trying twice on the second one			0
his senior consultant colleague also tried but could not fit the tie			0
' i could nâ€™t get a grip on the tissue , ' he said , yet he added that he believed he was the only surgeon in his department who used both diathermy and ties , as his colleagues were satisfied with just diathermy			0
he explained how , following the operation at the @entity30 , the usual checks were conducted and @entity8 was not bleeding			1
tragedy : the post-mortem examination on @entity8 was carried out at @entity89 @entity90 , who carried out the autopsy at @entity89 , told the coroner : ' at post mortem examination there was actually very little to see with the naked eye			1
it seemed to have healed as well as expected			0
' i also examined to see if any damage had been done to the major arteries supplying that area and they were all intact			0
' she said it was only when she examined samples under a microscope that she found an artery with necrosis , or dying tissue , in its wall			1
in the absence of any infection , she suggested a possible cause of the so - called secondary haemorrhage could have been part of the healing process itself			1
' granulation tissue is healing tissue and it has lots of blood vessels growing in it because it is the new tissue growing in to repair			0
it is very vascular , ' she said			0
' the granulated tissue is all healing and you have the broken surface on top			0
the tissue is gradually replaced but just at the stage when the damaged tissue is coming off it is possible to have secondary haemorrhage			0
' the next area is very rich in vessels and is exposed to the surface			0
it is typical of how catastrophic haemorrhage happens			2
' explaining that the condition was ' recognised , albeit rare ' , she warned : ' there are many publications demonstrating that it can even happen in hospital , that patients can die because of the rapidity			0
' dr @entity55 added that the only way @entity8 would have stood a chance of survival were if he and an anaesthetist had been standing by him with their equipment when the haemorrhage occurred			1
mr @entity37 recorded a narrative verdict on @entity8 at the inquest in @entity155 , adding : ' i will record that @entity8 died from a recognised late complication from an operative procedure			1
' he told the parents : ' one of the sad things is that what happened here is extremely rare but not rare to the people who suffer from it , because it happened to you			0

@entity8 died after he suffered cardio - respiratory failure when his lungs filled up after a ' catastrophic bleed ' from a tiny artery
