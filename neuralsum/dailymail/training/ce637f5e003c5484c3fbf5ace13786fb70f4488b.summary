by mail online reporter a baby girl has been saved from a deadly brain tumor after an insurer which refused to fund surgery at a specialist hospital had a change of heart			1
@entity8 's tumor was removed during a six - hour surgery at the renowned @entity10 in @entity11 about two weeks ago			1
pediatricians told the eight - month - old 's family yesterday that the growth was non-cancerous and she was on the mend			2
' we have tears of joy			0
we are so thrilled , ' @entity20 's mother , @entity19 , told @entity21			2
' there is some risk for re-growth and continued epilepsy , but this is the best news we could hear			0
@entity20 's brain tumor was detected in march when she was three - months - old			1
she suffered major seizures , at one point being hit by 15 in the space of a single day			0
the @entity8 's insurer , @entity41 , referred @entity20 to @entity10 for the last four months for her treatment			1
specialists at the hospital then produced a plan for beating the tumor , scheduling several procedures for which , @entity19 claims , her insurers happily paid			2
however , at the last minute , the insurer refused to cover the final surgery , saying the hospital was outside its ' network '			1
they instead referred her to another facility in @entity56 , @entity57			0
the family fought the decision , creating a petition on @entity61 that 's been signed by more than 1,600 people			1
suffering : @entity63 was diagnosed with a brain tumor when she was just three - months - old the family claimed that @entity10 had a 90 per cent survival rate for the operation @entity20 was booked for , compared with just 47 per cent for the other facility			1
' i was absolutely stunned because they had been sending us to @entity10 's all this time , ' 38 - year - old @entity19 told @entity21			2
' it 's rare for a tumor to be found in a child this young , it so clearly called for a neurosurgeon specialized in operating on babies - not just any surgeon			0
would you accept less than a 50 - 50 survival rate when you can have almost 100 per cent ? ' @entity41 insisted that the new provider would be just as good			1
however earlier this month they reversed their decision , allowing @entity20 to undergo surgery at @entity10 on july 11			2

we will continue to assist this family in making sure they receive the care they need			0
