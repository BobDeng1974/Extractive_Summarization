by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 21 july 2013 updated : 10:18 est , 21 july 2013 cashing in : bookies are taking bets on everything from the baby 's birthday to its name and hair colour first everyone was convinced it was july 13 , then july 19 , but whatever the @entity12 's actual due date , one thing is certain : there is still no royal baby			1
and that means bookies are cashing in as thousands of pounds are lost by those who were certain @entity12 's revelation she was due ' mid july ' meant the baby would arrive last week			1
bookmakers said the most popular day for due - date bets was thursday , july 18 , when 1,142 people lost money with @entity25 alone			1
one punter in @entity27 is £ 1,000 down after putting their money on july 17			2
the company said it will make £ 23,000 if the baby is n't born by midnight tonight , while @entity31 told the @entity32 it had made £ 25,000 from lost bets			1
@entity34 said it had already taken £ 100,000 in due date bets but could not say how many people had lost out as all bets remain open until the baby is born			1
the bookmaker has now stopped taking bets on when the baby will arrive , and said the majority of people had bet on it being tomorrow			1
spokesman @entity42 said : ' the money would suggest that it will be monday or tuesday at the very latest			0
' @entity44 , from @entity25 , said : ' in an ideal world we 'd love it if @entity48 have completely pulled the wool over our eyes and are actually expecting a late july or early august baby , because all the mathematicians and media thought it would be an early birthday and so that 's where all the money went			1
' yesterday @entity34 revealed it had seen a surge in bets for a due date in august , as punters appeared to decide the baby would have to be induced			1
doctors do not normally induce births until two weeks after the due date , which would be august 2 if the @entity12 was due on july 19			1
bookies are also taking bets on everything from the baby 's name to its hair colour , and whether @entity72 or @entity12 will be holding it when they first emerge from hospital			1
here , @entity83 's @entity82 and @entity84 speak to @entity86 's royal correspondent @entity85 waiting game : the world 's press has been camped outside the @entity90 of @entity91 in @entity92 for a fortnight , and social media is continually awash with rumours that she has gone into labour the @entity98 said on monday she was expecting the baby ' by the end of the week ' , suggesting it could arrive today			1
however , on wednesday the @entity102 appeared to suggest that the baby was already late			2
she told a 10 - year - old schoolgirl on a trip to @entity105 : ' i would very much like it to arrive because i ’m going on holiday soon ... i wish it would hurry up			2
' @entity72 and @entity12 's private office at @entity111 has refused to confirm the @entity113 's exact due date , although @entity12 herself let slip during a public walkabout earlier this year that it is ' mid-july '			1
@entity72 was said to have had a few days off from his job as an @entity119 pilot in @entity120 this week , which he was thought to have spent with his wife at their @entity111 residence			0
however , @entity12 , 31 , has also been staying at the home of her parents @entity127 and @entity128 in @entity129			0
thrilled : @entity130 ( left ) asked the @entity102 : ' would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl ? ' to which the @entity102 replied she would like the royal baby to ' hurry up ' before she goes off on holiday to @entity138 next week the world 's press has been camped outside the @entity90 , at @entity91 in @entity141 , where the @entity12 is expected to give birth , for over a fortnight			1
reporters have resorted to interviewing each other while they wait for news that @entity12 has gone into labour			0
the packed press area has itself become a tourist attraction for visitors to @entity92 , and those who drop by are interviewing and pictured by the waiting press			0
outside the hospital scores of royal fans from @entity154 and all over the world are waiting for the royal arrival			2
@entity157 and @entity158 took two months to get to @entity91 , @entity141 because the retired fruit and veg merchants travelled from their @entity162 home to @entity92 via @entity154 ’s canal network at four mph			2
their 55ft canal boat @entity165 , is moored just behind the royal hospital , filled with bagfuls of cards and presents for the baby , and its cabin draped with bunting			2
dedication : @entity157 and @entity158 who have sailed down from @entity162 on their narrowboat to be near the hospital for the royal birth			0
with a top speed of 4mph the journey took two months ‘ as soon as we heard @entity12 was pregnant , i said that we should aim to get there for the birth , so we left home on may 1 , ’ mrs @entity180 said			0
‘ and we hope to be here as long as it takes			0
after all , we ’re not paying for a hotel			0
’ @entity188 is now in his second week of living on a wooden bench opposite the street entrance to the @entity191 , @entity91 ’s private maternity unit			0
the retired carpenter from @entity78 has been a familiar fixture at major royal events for years , always dressed head to toe in @entity199 clothes beneath a @entity199 umbrella hat			1
the @entity201 , he says , know him as ‘ @entity202 ’			0
@entity188 , 78 , has been here so long that , a few days ago , he felt compelled to take himself back to @entity78 for a bath and a change of clothes			2
he then returned to @entity92 with enough spare @entity199 kit to last him as long as it takes			0
‘ what ’s another week ? ’ he says			0
‘ it ’s not boring and it gives my wife a rest from me			0
’ @entity214 presenter @entity213 has been knitting a pink bootie live on @entity214 ’s flagship today programme			0
‘ i think it may be even bigger news at home than it is here , ’ she said , adding : ‘ once @entity12 goes into labour , ’ she says , ‘ we ’ll be sleeping right here			0
’ fan : royal supporter @entity223 poses with his royal baby memorabilia as he waits across the street from @entity91 prime position : @entity188 , who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently for news camped out : some people have been staying outside the hospital for several days			1
