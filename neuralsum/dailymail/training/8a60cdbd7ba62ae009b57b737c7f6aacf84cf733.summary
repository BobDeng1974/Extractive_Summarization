when it comes to our sex lives it seems that , for many of us , the most action we 're getting is a poke on @entity7			1
a new survey from condom brand @entity9 has revealed that @entity12 lovers are allowing technology to get in the way of their sex lives			1
in a poll of 2000 men and women over 15 per cent of women and 17 per cent of men admitted to answering their phone or reading a text message during sex , a figure that rises in the capital to 20 per cent			1
men are twice as likely to make the social media faux pas as women with eight per cent of men admitting to checking a social network compared to just four per cent of women			0
it appears that our infatuation with our tech could be damaging our real life relationships			0
some 30 per cent of respondents said that their partner had been distracted by some sort of tech device whilst they were getting intimate , nearly three in ten believing that it gets in the way of their sex life and 40 per cent agreeing or strongly agreeing that it has a negative effect on their relationship			0
a further 60 per cent also admitted that they actually spend more time using technology while in bed with their partner than having sex			1
this problem of third wheeling laptops and gooseberry @entity65 is something that , unsurprisingly , is affecting the younger generation more than their older counterparts			0
over half of 18 - 24 year olds believe that technology is adversely affecting their relationship compared with only a quarter of over 55s			0
sex and relationship expert , @entity76 , said : ' many people find love through dating websites or social media - but it 's a worrying trend that many are also feeling gradually ousted in their relationships in favour of interaction online			0
' as a call to action , @entity9 is releasing a short film which follows the stories of several couples who , like most of us , have become seduced by the lure of a screen and encourages people to make the most of @entity96 by reconnecting whilst the lights are off			1
@entity96 is an annual event organised by charity , @entity99 to encourage people around the world to turn off their lights for one hour to celebrate their commitment to the planet			2

as part of @entity96 on 29 march , @entity9 is encouraging us to turn our tech off and turn our partners on @entity76 goes on to say : ' there is , of course , a great place for technology in our lives but habitual use and reliance on our gadgets can lead to bad habits in relationships			1
@entity9 ’s film is a great reminder that we need to take time out to get up close and intimate with our lovers , and reconnect with their needs face - to - face			2
' @entity129 , global marketing manager at @entity9 said : ' @entity9 believes nothing should get in the way of great sex but our growing obsession with phones , laptops , tvs and @entity138 is n’t bringing us closer together , it ’s pushing us apart			2
' so , this @entity96 let ’s log off and switch off ; use it as an excuse to swap our laptops for some loving and ditch our phones to enjoy some foreplay			0
let ’s turn off to turn on ! ' the @entity146 film can be viewed on @entity147 from 19 march # turnofftoturnon			0
