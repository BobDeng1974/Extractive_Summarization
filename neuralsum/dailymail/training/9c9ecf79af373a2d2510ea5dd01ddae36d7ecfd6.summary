by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:11 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 16:32 est , 10 january 2014 @entity3 announced on wednesday that they will be improving their animal care policies after shocking undercover footage of abuse at a supplying pig farm surfaced from an animal rights group			1
tyson food sent out letters on wednesday to farms requiring that they stop employing ' blunt force euthanasia ' as a means of killing piglets			1
they also told farms to use ' pain mitigation techniques ' when castrating the piglets and when removing a part of the tail			1
@entity21 reports that @entity3 wrote in their letter that they understood how using blunt force to kill pigs ' has been historically acceptable ' for some time in the meat industry but may not match the expectations of today ’s customers or consumers			1
farms not under contact can choose to apply the new standards or not to			2
' we ’re trying to balance the expectations of consumers with the realities of today ’s hog farming business , ' said the letter signed by a senior vice president and the vice president who runs the company ’s @entity57			0
' we look forward to working with you on our current challenges , ' it said			0
the executive director of the animal rights group who filmed the video , @entity62 was encouraged and appreciative of @entity3 's efforts			1
' the announcement that @entity3 is making significant animal welfare improvements , including urging its pork producers to move away from inherently cruel and restrictive gestation crates , signals an important new era and direction for the company , ' said @entity62			1
' we urge @entity3 to add more teeth to the new guidelines by making them a mandate for all of its pork producers , rather than a mere recommendation			1
' the appalling video aired by @entity21 in november was shot at @entity83 between september and october by an activist with @entity85 and shows pigs being punched , kicked , smashed into concrete and locked in cages so small they ca n’t even move			1
the undercover worker who shot the video named ' @entity90 ' told @entity21 news that the abuse was ' commonplace ' at the farm			1
@entity83 , in @entity94 , supplied meat for @entity3 , according to @entity85			1
@entity3 severed all ties after the video was made public			1
‘ we ’re extremely disappointed by the mistreatment shown in the video and will not tolerate this kind of animal mishandling , ’ a @entity3 spokesperson told @entity98 following the incident			1
‘ we are immediately terminating our contract with this farmer and will take possession of the animals remaining on the farm , ’ he added			1
no anesthesia provided : piglets have their tails cut and testicles removed without the benefit of any medication to dull the pain appaling : this worker sits on the pig , repeatedly punching it no big deal : a former hog farm worker commented on @entity121 that the pigs do n't even feel the punches despicable : this piglet is kicked by an out - of - control farmhand over the top : it is not uncommon for animals to be hit , the former farmhand said , but it usually never approaches this level of violence farm owner @entity134 reportedly fired all employees involved in the video , but their faces were often obscured from sight			1
the disturbing footage begins with a montage of animals being hit with wooden boards , kicked , beaten and lying in pools of blood or locked in cages			2
the deplorable physical abuse did n’t just stop at kicking and punching the defenseless pigs			2
piglets also endured being violently shaken , thrown through the air only to be spiked on to the concrete floor like footballs or even held by the tail and swung repeatedly into the floor			2
a walkway is shown with several bloody piglets on the ground having seizures or writhing in agony , blood is splattered everywhere			2
multiple piglets have their tails removed either with a shovel swung violently down on the tail , severing it , or with a pair of shears – no painkillers are administered			2
another unfortunate piglet is also shown being held by their hind legs and having their testicles removed , again without painkillers or anesthesia			0
the suffering causes it to let out a loud squeal and violently shake			0
a pregnant pig too fat to move is kicked , punched and has clumps of hair ripped out			0
horrifying : this pig is still alive , but has begun to rot after being tossed on a pile of other dead pigs even live pigs are left to starve and rot amongst corpses this is not right : piglets writhe in agony after being slammed onto the concrete floor , some have seizures not uncommon , but being done wrong : ill or infirm piglets are often slammed into the ground to instantly kill them , according to a former pig farm employee one pig had a bowling ball thrown at its head , other had their eyes gouged out or their ears violently pulled			2
pigs barely clinging to life are tossed in piles of dead pigs , they start to rot even though they are still living			0
a @entity121 user who once worked on a hog farm commenting that the abuse shown in the video is far from uncommon , but that this farm took it too far			1
‘ piglets are killed by having their heads smashed against the concrete because it ’s quick and if done properly ( which those guys are n’t doing ) the piglets are dead before they even know what happened , ’ said legless_kraig			0
close quarters : pregnant pigs are kept in tightly - packed pens that provide no room to move waiting to die : the miserable pigs have nothing to live for , they are stripped of their dignity several times a day dead inside : the sad images show pigs suffering from depression , malnourishment and a host of other issues ‘ pulling by the ears to get them to move somewhere specific was common and kicking in the back end was too but realistically the pigs feel nothing from the kicking , ’ he continued			0
‘ gouging of the eyes was something that was done to the adult pigs when they were n't moving down the aisles or being stubborn and hard to handle , ’ the @entity241 further explained			0
they are mistreated , malnourished and then sent to slaughter – if they endure the torture long enough to be that lucky			0
most of the employees are miserable too , @entity251 wrote			0
‘ it was n't a job i felt proud of doing but i was young and needed a way to get money … that last year was a struggle every day to just drive to work			0
’ the owner of the farm , @entity134 , said he was also shocked by the video			2
' i was stunned that anyone could be that callous in their treatment of any animal , ' said @entity134 to @entity21			0
' after viewing the video , i immediately returned to my farm and terminated the employees seen in the video			1
' @entity134 said that he used approved euthanasia methods he calls ' humane			0
' he also said workers are instructed to make sure an animal is dead before they leave it			0
' it is a part of the business and there are prescribed methods of euthanasia and i follow those to a @entity279 , ' said @entity134 .			0
