@entity0 was delighted @entity1 once again took a point from a trip to one of the @entity6 's major sides but feels games like saturday 's against @entity8 hold the key to the @entity11 ' season			1
ending a run of four straight defeats , @entity13 's men drew 1 - 1 with @entity16 at @entity17 after a strike around the hour mark from substitute @entity20 cancelled out @entity22 's first - half opener for the hosts			1
@entity1 - above the relegation zone on goal difference alone - have also secured creditable draws at @entity26 and @entity27 this term			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 's result against @entity8 on saturday is vital if they are to stay up this season but @entity0 sees the truly vital fixtures for the team being those where they are taking on outfits lower down the table			1
@entity1 boss @entity13 stressed after wednesday 's match that the points his side claimed from such matches last term , their top - flight comeback season , were ultimately the reason they beat the drop			1
and when asked if games like saturday 's visit to the @entity47 of @entity8 are what will define @entity1 's 2014 - 15 campaign , @entity11 centre - back @entity0 said : ' yes , of course they are			1
' you look at our recent performances away from home , when we have been to the @entity56 , @entity57 and now @entity17 , and we have taken a point each time			0
' we can take a lot out of this - even in the first half ( against @entity16 ) , with as much possession as they had , how many shots did they have on goal ? not too many			1
' but yes , the games against the likes of @entity8 and other teams that are going to be around us are where we really need to pick up the points			2
' @entity0 ( right ) played a commanding role at the heart of @entity1 's defence at @entity17 on wednesday night while it proved a constructive evening for @entity1 , wednesday was frustrating for @entity16 , who had looked well in control in the first half but faded badly as the contest wore on and were booed off at the end by some fans			1
@entity16 boss @entity83 - whose side have been playing in the @entity86 group stages on top of their domestic fixtures , qualifying for the knockout rounds - admitted tiredness had been a factor			2
the @entity93 have also had injuries to contend with , but @entity16 defender @entity95 says the squad must keep pushing on , with a tough - looking trip to @entity98 on saturday up next			2
reflecting on the @entity1 game , @entity95 told evertontv : ' it was very frustrating			0
' we did n't lose the game but we feel like we have lost			0
we felt the frustration from the fans as well			0
@entity16 defender @entity95 ( right ) admitted wednesday 's night draw felt like a defeat after the match ' @entity1 made it tough for us and it was difficult to play forward at times			1
' we have had a lot of games and that 's going to continue			0
' we have to move on because it is a big game this weekend , then next week , then the following weekend			0
' meanwhile , @entity1 midfielder @entity115 is set for scans on his knee after limping off in the @entity16 game due to an ongoing tendon problem			2
and @entity13 fears @entity120 could be out for as long as six weeks			0
@entity1 midfielder @entity115 ( right ) is set for scans on his knee dut to an ongoing tendon problem the manager said : ' it 's been an ongoing tendonitis problem and the alternative may be an injection			2
' that could rule him out for a month or six weeks			0
' we 'll have some more scans and see how he is			0
' @entity13 also said a knee injury that forced @entity133 off only appeared to be a nasty cut .			0
