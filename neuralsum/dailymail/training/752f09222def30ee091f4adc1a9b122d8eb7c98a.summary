@entity1 ’s plans to take on tv with a live streaming box may have been pushed back until next year , but a patent has revealed clues about how it could be controlled			1
the application details a digital remote , in the form of an app for an @entity11 or @entity12 , that changes channels , browses menus and could be used to schedule recordings			1
it would automatically connect to @entity1 ’s set - top tv box , and unlike the current remote app , the patent shows a system that would work across phones , tablets and laptops			1
it would connect to @entity1 ’s set - top tv box , and unlike the current remote app , the patent shows a system that would work across phones , tables and laptops			1
it could be used as an alternative to , or as well as , the current control the patent appears to show @entity1 following @entity41 ’s @entity40 lead , which can already be controlled using a range of mobile devices			1
‘ many media devices utilise remote controls for browsing through and selecting content , ’ explained the patent			2
‘ however , known remote controls are too simplistic and are not user friendly			0
’ rumours claim that @entity1 's tv set will use a @entity53 screen , making is four times sharper than even current hdtv pictures			2
the firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live tv as well as but films ans tv shows			0
previous reports claimed it would run apps , and work with an @entity12 or @entity11 as a remote control , which has been given a boost with the latest patent application			1
it may also include gesture controls , after @entity1 bought @entity71 firm @entity69 , or be controlled using voice			2
it continued that common remote controls are configured with up , down , left and right buttons , a selection indicator button , and maybe a keypad			0
but this layout is mainly suited for browsing ‘ old - fashion numerical list television programming ’ , said the firm			0
@entity1 stated that a new paradigm exists for the way people browse for content , and text entry is now ‘ very time - consuming when using a simplistic remote control			2
’ it also said that mirroring the display is n't a viable alternative , which is why it 's proposing a digital remote			2
‘ mirroring a display of a media device onto another display of another electronic device can result in the poor representation of the content			0
‘ for example , suppose a large screen television display can clearly display one hundred icons that are clear enough to decipher			0
‘ the same one hundred icons mirrored onto the small screen of smartphone would clearly be indecipherable			0
the patent appears to show @entity1 following @entity41 ’s @entity40 ( pictured ) lead , which can already be controlled using a range of mobile devices @entity1 said controls ( current @entity107 remote pictured left ) are simplistic and not user friendly			1
it continued that many feature up , left , down , menu , select , right and play and pause buttons ( labelled one to seven on the left - hand image ) , but this layout is suited for ‘ old - fashion ’ menus			0
@entity1 's proposed digital remote is pictured right ‘ alternatively , the smartphone could only view a small portion of the mirrored display at a time , but doing so is not user friendly			1
‘ mirroring technology does not adequately address the need for remote browsing of content			0
’ the application was filed last year , but only awarded last week			0
@entity1 sold more than $ 1 billion ( £ 622 million ) worth of @entity107 set - top boxes in 2013 and is investing heavily in the next generation of products , boss @entity126 said at the company 's annual meeting earlier this year			1

future versions are expected to include apps and the ability to watch live tv as well as buy movies and tv shows			0
previous rumours have stated that the new system may also be controlled by voice , similar to the way @entity152 ’s @entity151 is controlled .			2
