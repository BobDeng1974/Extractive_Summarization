daredevils @entity9 , 20 , and @entity10 , 24 , have scaled some of the most recognisable tourist attractions on the planet and captured every moment			1
@entity18 up with queues and typical tours , the thrill - seeking duo have taken to the rooftops of @entity21 's @entity20 , @entity23 's @entity22 , and the @entity24 and @entity25 in @entity26 down for video sky high : travellers @entity10 ( pictured dangling from the cathedral in @entity23 ) and @entity9 have scaled some of the world 's most recognisable tourist attractions also taking on @entity35 's pyramids and @entity37 's latest skyscrapers , the @entity33 travellers have been labelled ' the @entity38 '			1

mr @entity9 said : ‘ we are just chasing the dream and always looking to go to the next highest point to see the things no one else gets to see			0
oh la la ! mr @entity9 gets a view of the @entity24 that few tourists in @entity49 get from a nearby rooftop			1
the pair capture every thrill - seeking moment on camera do n't look down : the daredevils have gained the name ' @entity69 ' for photographs such as this , legs dangling from the @entity24 at a dizzy height from where you 'll never be : the pair often stake out locations for hours , trying to find the best way to scale the structures and get past security , who have been known to have beaten the @entity33 travellers when they 've caught them ‘ we do n't mean to trespass or harm anyone one so we do often have to wait until the coast is clear			1
‘ but when you get there the views are spectacular and we want to keep going until we have mastered every city			0
’ the pair regularly stake out locations in the early hours of the morning , waiting for guards and security staff to turn their back			0
mr @entity9 said : ‘ sometimes you can wait around all evening for the perfect chance , but you get there and then you are seen			0
say cheese ! mr @entity9 and mr @entity10 ( left to right ) pose for a photo ' skywalking ' above @entity45 after they got sick of waiting in queues at popular tourist attractions cool , calm and collected : mr @entity9 chats on his mobile phone while sitting on a ledge of a skyscraper building in the @entity109 town @entity50 ' chasing the dream ' : the pair have scaled buildings and structures in 12 cities in seven countries including @entity49 ( left ) in @entity116 and @entity45 ( right ) in @entity117 and are ' always looking to go to the next highest point to see the things no one else gets to see , ' mr @entity9 said trespass trapeze : mr @entity10 holds his balance on a structure in @entity50 , one of many off - limits buildings in which the pair sneak past security guards to access ‘ when that happens and you are caught guards can beat you up quite a bit - but it 's never too bad			1
‘ the views are worth it overall as you 're taken to the top of the world with some of the most beautiful surroundings			0
‘ it 's usually quite straightforward to scale roofs but in @entity33 it 's a little bit more tricky - that 's the main place where it can be dangerous			2
’ the death - defying ‘ skywalkers ’ have garnered a huge following online and insist they do n't do it for the attention			2
mr @entity10 said : ‘ a lot of people really like what we do and say ' well done ' but we 're just focused on enjoying what we do and seeing the most spectacular cities from above			0
‘ you can get better than that - but we certainly would n't recommend everybody having a go because of course it is dangerous			0
’ greetings from @entity50 : people and beach umbrellas look like ants from the skywalkers ' view from the top , who now have a huge following online but insist they do n't do it for the attention will master every city : climbing to death - defying heights to take their photographs , the pair ( mr @entity10 pictured ) plan to keep scaling sky high structures in cities around the world see the world like no one else : mr @entity9 leans precariously from a building to get his desired shot high above the streets of the picturesque city of @entity46 in the @entity185 do n't look down : the duo , who scaled structures in @entity49 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) , do not recommend other punters try out their stunts , saying it is too dangerous skyscraper scaling : mr @entity10 and mr @entity9 ( left to right ) stand overlooking the @entity117 city of @entity45 , saying it is ' quite straightforward ' to scale roofs view from the top : mr @entity9 multitasks his climb and a phone call in @entity50 , terrifyingly high above the world below no freefall in @entity47 : the ' skywalkers ' say they 're focussed on enjoying their adventures and seeing the most spectacular cities in the world from far above sunshine on high : the incredible view that mr @entity9 and mr @entity206 enjoyed as the sun goes down over @entity49			1
