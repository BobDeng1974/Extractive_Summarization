trekking through the dunes of the @entity1 in 40 degree heat can be thirsty work even for camels			1
and one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves			1
the herd of camels were on a trek across the @entity13 dunes in @entity14 , where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink			1
a camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the @entity1 desert tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees but rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink			1
photographer @entity31 , who captured the image , said : ' the picture where a camel drinks from a bottle , it was obviously just for fun			2
' they do n't usually drink too often and while we were there , i had n't seen any camel drinking			1
' we only made a short stop - i would say not more than 15 minutes - but judging by how fast they drank it , i guess they were thirsty			2
' mr @entity31 travelled over 370 miles across the @entity49 mountain range from the @entity14 city of @entity51 to reach the sand dunes			0
the pictures were snapped by photographer @entity54 , who spent time trekking across the @entity13 dunes in @entity14 the 26 - year - old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes , they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area			1
and while there , they experienced extreme temperatures ranging from soaring heat during the day to freezing temperatures around minus five late at night			0
mr @entity31 , from @entity67 , @entity68 added : ' i was photographing the route from @entity51 to @entity13 through the @entity49 region			0
the group experienced extreme temperatures on their trek ranging from soaring hear during the day to freezing temperatures at night ' we stopped at a base camp for the dunes where we spent the night			2
' like any other desert , it was incredibly hot during the day and cold at night			0
' riding the camels was a little uncomfortable to be honest			0
' after two hours , your back really starts to hurt but i would say that was a nice experience because it 's a huge animal that goes on a paced rhythm in a majestic environment			0
