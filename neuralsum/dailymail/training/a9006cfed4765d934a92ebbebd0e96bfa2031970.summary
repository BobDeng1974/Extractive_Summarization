a leading public school is to give pupils lessons in ‘ grit ’ to help them emulate children in high - performing @entity6 nations such as @entity7			1
@entity8 will encourage youngsters to adopt beliefs more commonly associated with so - called ‘ tiger mothers ’ – that ability is not fixed and hard work will eventually pay off			1
the @entity15 school – which charges boarding fees of £ 34,125 a year – aims to find the best way of teaching pupils to persevere in the face of academic setbacks , instead of assuming they are simply not clever enough			1
@entity8 in @entity15 , a leading public school which charges £ 34,125 boarding fees per year , will teach youngsters to adopt the belief ability is not fixed and hard work will eventually pay off it has become known for adopting innovative approaches including ‘ happiness ’ lessons to boost pupils ’ well - being and outlook on life			1
working with a @entity33 researcher in a two - year project , pupils will be introduced to cutting - edge brain science which emphasises the role of effort and practice – rather than relying on innate talent			1
if successful , the initiative could be introduced in other schools			0
the lessons will aim to explode the widely - held view that only some children are born ‘ smart ’			1
instead of giving up , they will be told that working hard will boost their abilities in areas they find difficult			0
schools in countries such as @entity7 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , which regularly top global league tables , are known to value hard work rather than focusing on natural ability			1
but experts warned youngsters should not be ‘ drilled at all costs ’			1
project leader dr @entity61 , of @entity62 , said she believed it was right to encourage hard work , but that the approach ‘ should be paired with compassion ’			1
dr @entity66 said : ‘ the results would show these countries excelling and they would also show that they adopt a growth mindset , that the harder you work the better you will do			1
‘ you ’ll hear things like , “ that ’s such a beautiful project , you must have worked so hard ” as opposed to “ that ’s such a beautiful project , you must be so bright or so talented or so smart ”			1
‘ right away , the cultural assumption is that if you did something very well then you worked very hard , as opposed to then you are talented			0
‘ actually that is more accurate from a neuroscience point of view			0
working really hard at something does develop your brain and your abilities			0
‘ it ’s a really important concept and important to correct that misconception in pop culture and definitely with children			2
’ dr @entity66 said she believed tiger mothers were ‘ right ’ in their belief in encouraging hard work			1
but she added : ‘ it should be paired with compassion			0
it ’s good for students to work really hard but it ’s important to really invest in things that they personally feel are important and interesting , not what someone ’s forcing them to do			2
‘ if a student is really passionate about something themselves and they are working really hard , that ’s the ideal case			0
they will be more what we call intrinsically motivated or internally motivated			0
i think it ’s problematic if there ’s too much pressure coming from external forces making them do things			0
‘ i do think it ’s good to encourage hard work , but hard work toward their own personal goals and in the context of compassion			2
‘ kids ca n’t just do what they want all the time , of course			0
but it needs to be a supportive environment , and for them not to be drilled at all costs , that ’s not good education			0
‘ some neuroscience shows that if your brain is too stressed in that way , it ’s not as effective at learning			0
you really want to support them emotionally while you are supporting them to be hard workers , i think that ’s important			0
’ the project is being carried out in conjunction with three local state schools and the techniques it develops could be adopted by schools around the country			2
it is one of the first to emerge from @entity145 ’s new educational research centre which was launched this month to eliminate ‘ guesswork ’ and ‘ hunches ’ from teaching practice			2
tasks are likely to include spotting shortcuts around the school which have become well - trodden paths as more people have walked on them			2
‘ we use that as a metaphor for what ’s happening in the brain - that the more you are using your circuits the more strengthened they are becoming , ’ dr @entity66 added			1
‘ there are genetic contributions but the environment has a really powerful impact on the brain			0
nothing is set in stone genetically			0
’ the moniker ‘ tiger mother ’ was popularised by @entity172 law professor @entity171 who described how she chivvied her daughters to achieve academic and musical success @entity53 - style in a best - selling guide which provoked fierce debate in @entity177			1
the @entity178 , published in 2011 , was described as ‘ the story of my family ’s journey in two cultures ’ .			2

@entity8 , @entity15 , will teach children that ability is not fixed
students will work with a @entity33 researcher on two - year project
aim to emulate pupils in high - performing @entity6 nations like @entity7
school known for innovate approaches including ‘ happiness ’ lessons
