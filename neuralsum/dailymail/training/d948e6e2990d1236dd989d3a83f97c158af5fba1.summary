sergeant @entity0 encourages his officers to catch up on their paperwork using laptops in coffee shops around the community years of hard work are finally paying off for dedicated police officer @entity0 - who is celebrating the first crime free day in 25 years on the same beat			1
sergeant @entity0 has tirelessly worked to reduce crime in @entity11 , @entity12 , since 1988			1
his days are normally spent dealing with burglaries , muggings , robberies , car theft , vandalism and drunken fighting			1
but a string of initiatives have seen crime fall - and earlier this week not a single incident was reported in a 24 - hour period for the first time on record			1
@entity26 said from 6.30am on monday to 6.30am on tuesday this week , nobody in a town of more than 30,000 people reported a crime			1
not even a single domestic incident was recorded - which is normally a daily occurrence			2
@entity26 said nobody even had a bike stole and there was not a single complaint of shoplifting			1
the town will typically see about 10 crimes a day			0
he said : ' i was really surprised			0
i certainly have never known that to happen before and i first started here 26 years ago			2
' twenty years ago , @entity11 was horrendous			1
you could n't walk from the station to the town centre on a saturday night without immediately getting involved in some kind of incident			0
' there are things we are doing that are having an impact , though , and our emphasis on being out and about in the town and visible as much as we can has certainly had a positive impact			0
' we are also better at targeting repeat offenders as it is true to say that there 's only a small number of individuals responsible for the large majority of crime in @entity11			1
' this week was the first time in 25 years @entity61 went 24 hours without any crimes reported officers based at @entity66 ( pictured ) do their admin work in public using wifi enabled laptops but the crime - free days for @entity11 did not last longer than around 30 hours			1
by lunchtime on tuesday , a domestic violence offence , a theft and a burglary had been reported			0
@entity26 pointed to @entity76 's increased use of bikes to increase their visibility on patch , which has helped reduce crime			1
officers are also now doing admin work in public thanks to 3g and wifi enabled laptops , giving them more time on the beat			2
@entity0 said : ' to not have any reported crime at all is incredibly unusual and it is obviously a bit of an anomaly			2
' i 've not completely wiped out all crime from @entity11 forever			2
' if it was just one thing that i could put my finger on then i would replicate it , but it 's not as easy as that			0
' a spokesman for @entity96 said : ' the comments made by sergeant @entity0 related to a period when no live crimes were reported in the @entity11 and @entity101 areas			1
' clearly , officers would have still been investigating crime reported before this period and going about their daily patrols during this time			0
the @entity12 town , with a population of 30,000 , normally has about 10 crimes reported each day officers are also using bicycles to increase their presence within @entity112 ( pictured ) ' the @entity113 has increased its visibility over the past few months which has resulted in a drop in reported crime			1
' we would always urge anyone wishing to report a crime to do so by calling @entity96 on 101 or @entity120 on 0800 555 111 where information can be left anonymously			0
' @entity11 police are making a strong push to ensure police officers are constantly seen by possible offenders by ensuring they are using bikes and doing paperwork on the go			2
@entity26 said : ' we 're also out and about a lot more			0
we 're leading the way with things like getting police back on bicycles - we can do 2,000 miles in a month on the bikes - and more and more foot patrols			0
' i 'm also very keen that when my officers have paperwork to do , it 's done on laptops now so they can go and do it in a coffee shop in town , or at a community centre			0
' they are working doing admin , but they are visible			0

sergeant @entity0 started working the @entity11 , @entity12 beat in 1988
his days are normally spent dealing with burglaries , muggings or robberies
but for first time in 25 years , not a single incident was reported for 24 hours
@entity26 puts it down to new initiatives increasing police 's public presence
