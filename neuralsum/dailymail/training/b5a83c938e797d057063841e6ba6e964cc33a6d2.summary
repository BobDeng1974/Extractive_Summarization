by @entity0 @entity1 : food writer @entity2 has criticised farmers ' markets his acerbic put downs are usually restricted to hapless chefs and pretentious restaurants			1
but food critic @entity2 has now served up a withering assessment of farmers ’ markets – to the fury of those who run them			1
the @entity15 star , who also works as a critic for @entity19 programme @entity17 , said that the overpriced fare sold at local markets is nothing more than a ‘ status symbol ’ for wealthy shoppers			1
instead , the 47 - year - old has extolled the virtues of sprawling supermarket chains who offer cheap ingredients , while dismissing the idea of buying a £ 15 chicken as similar to splashing out on a @entity33 handbag			2
while mr @entity2 said that he enjoyed the experience of visiting local markets , the increasing difficulty in feeding a growing worldwide population meant that a minority of shoppers who insisted on buying expensive , locally - grown food resulted in ‘ a veneer of self - righteousness ’			1
in an interview in the local @entity43 , @entity2 said : ‘ as i say repeatedly , i like a good farmers ’ market			1
but if you think they ’re a genuine answer to food retail in the @entity50 , you ’re sadly mistaken			1
‘ buying a £ 15 chicken is no more a challenge to the supermarkets than buying a @entity33 handbag is a challenge to @entity56			2
it ’s a status symbol			0
it ’s a nice one and one i ’m able to enjoy ; and one i suspect a lot of your readers in the @entity61 are able to enjoy because they ’ve got a penny or two			0
‘ i ’m not a head - banging old trot			0
there is nothing wrong with spending your expendable income in whatever way you wish			0
but what you must n’t do is to allow there to be a veneer of self - righteousness across the top of it , which makes that indulgence of an aesthetic into some political statement			0
because that it ai n’t			0
’ it was last year that mr @entity2 released a book called a @entity79 in a @entity80 , which championed supermarkets , super-dairies and industrialised production methods			1
he argued that a growing global population , especially in @entity85 and @entity86 , are putting growing pressure of food resources around the world			0
he warned in the interview with @entity43 that the increasing difficulties in feeding so many people will ‘ make the sight of young chefs on telly talking about their passion for cooking and their commitment to local and seasonal ingredients sound like the screeching of fiddles while @entity100 burns			0
’ not accessible : mr @entity2 said farmers ' markets were the designer label of food shopping while supermarkets the high street chains talking about the benefits of foreign imports and giving the example of being able to buy cheap produce such as corn from the @entity114 , he added in the interview : ‘ you do n’t own a local mobile phone because they make them better and cheaper in @entity85			1
’ however , mr @entity2 ’s comments have angered the @entity121 , who claim that traditional @entity50 markets employ almost 100,000 people across the country			1
@entity126 , ceo of the @entity121 hit out at mr @entity2 , saying : ‘ this kind of thing really gets my goat and i ’d like to put mr @entity2 right			2
‘ he is clearly taking this to the extreme by criticising what he sees as “ fashionable ” farmers markets			1
there are 1,400 traditional markets operating across the @entity50 , all of which could beat supermarkets hands down in terms quality of meat , fish and vegetables			2
‘ i can name markets which will offer 30 different types of potato , while most supermarkets will offer just three			2
@entity149 ’s markets have a huge appeal with the @entity50 public , and these traditional markets have seen a huge increase in popularity following the horsemeat scandal , because clearly people trust the produce			0
‘ turnover from farmer ’s markets in the @entity50 reaches almost £ 4bn each year , and we ca n’t ignore that they are a major employers			0
there are almost 100,000 people working on markets across the @entity50			0
to suggest supermarkets are a better alternative to traditional farmer ’s markets is wrong			2

critic @entity2 praised supermarkets as being *affordable*
@entity174 farmers ' markets are ' not a genuine answer to food retail '
*compared* them to designer *clothes* and high street chains
