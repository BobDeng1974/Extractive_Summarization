a new species of glass frog has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides			1
the creature , named @entity6 , was found in the mountains of eastern @entity8 and has a distinctive call			1
while most of its body is a brilliant lime green , like all species of glass frogs , the skin on its underside is see - though , making its organs easily visible			1
a new species of glass frog has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides			1
@entity6 ( pictured ) was found in the mountains of eastern @entity8 and has a distinctive call the animal ’s heart , liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible			1
scientists were surprised to stumble across the frog , given that a through survey of the region was conducted late last century , and reported their find in the journal @entity30			0
the frog was named by @entity33 who discovered it , after his mother @entity35 to thank her for supporting his interest in science , @entity8 ’s @entity31 reported			2
the animal ’s heart , liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible ( pictured ) thanks to translucent skin on its under side			1
it 's distinguishable from other glass frogs which have this strange characteristic , by its long toes and black and white eyes the bodies of glass frogs are bright green on their backs , while their abdominal skin is translucent			1
this means that the animal 's heart , liver and gastrointestinal tract are visible			0
the first glass frog was discovered in 1872			1
they are thought to have originated in @entity60 before spreading into @entity61			0
glass frogs are generally small , ranging from an inch to three inches in length ( 2.5cm to 7.5cm )			1
they may look similar to tree frogs , but their eyes face forward , instead of sideways			2
the frogs are mostly arboreal , meaning that they live in trees and can be found along rivers and streams during the breeding season			2
lead author of the study , dr @entity35 said : its advertisement call is quite unique … it ’s different than any other species that has been discovered			0
’ the study says the frog ’s ‘ advertisement call ’ consists of ‘ a single tonal long metallic whistle - like note with a duration of 0.40 – 0.55 s.			2
. and a dominant frequency of 3.35 – @entity86 ’			0
it ’s likely the frog uses it to find a mate in the mountain forests			0
dr @entity35 said that the amphibian sounds more like an insect than a frog , which may explain how experts missed it during their extensive survey			0
the frog also measures just one inch ( 2.5cm ) long , making it relatively difficult to spot among the foliage in the west forests and rainforests of the @entity102 foothills of @entity8 where it was discovered at elevations of between 1,312 ft to 2,624 ft ( 400 – 800 m )			2
there are 149 known species of glass frogs in @entity107 , 14 of which can be found in @entity8			1
@entity108 stands out from the others because of its captivating black and white eyes - which look similar to @entity111 the frog ’s - as well as its long , thin feet			1
they have historically been mistaken for tree frogs , but there is a major difference – in that their eyes face forward , instead of sideways like a tree frog 's			2
@entity108 stands out from other glass frogs because of its unusual black and white eyes ( pictured left ) , which are similar to those of @entity111 , of the @entity126 ( pictured right ) in that they face forward the frog was found in the mountains of eastern @entity8 in the provinces @entity131 and @entity132 ( shaded in pale green ) and has a distinctive call scientists have discovered an aphrodisiac for frogs and fish			1
added to water , a supplement has been shown to boost reproduction in frogs , fish , mollusc and roundworms - and it could work for humans too , @entity139 reported			2
experts from the @entity149 observed guppy fish at @entity151			0
when the fish were given a peptide , or short protein , they produced four times as many offspring in six months as fish that had not nothing placed in their tanks			0
similar tests were carried out on brown mentalla frogs at @entity162 , leading the endangered amphibian from @entity164 to breed for the first time			0
dr @entity166 of the university , who is an expert on nematodes , or roundworms , said : ' the supplement brought reproductive activity forward and increased the number of offspring by about 80 per cent in the famous soil nematode , caenorhabditis elegans			0
' what is suggested by our work is a biochemical mechanism of action that is conserved across the animal kingdom			0
' the scientists hope to extend their research so the aphrodisiac can be developed for mammals and humans .			0

*hyalinobatrachium* *dianae* was found in the mountains of east @entity8
it 's lime - *coloured* on top but has translucent skin on its underside
glass frog has a distinctive mating call that *resembles* a tin whistle
distinguished from other glass frogs by its eyes , which look like @entity111 's
