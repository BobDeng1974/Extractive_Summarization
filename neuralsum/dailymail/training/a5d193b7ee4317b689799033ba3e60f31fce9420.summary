as a child @entity6 , 23 , was refused an audition and told he would never succeed but went on to stubbornly defy the odds and the pessimists to reach the milestone today			1
the pianist from @entity12 in @entity13 is also part of the @entity15 , the country ’s first disabled orchestra , which played to welcome @entity18 athletes to @entity19			1
he said : ‘ it was soul crushing because that ’s all i wanted to do - i could feel it would be an uphill struggle , but it made me more determined , i ’m quite a stubborn character			2
’ he taught himself to play on a cheap , electric keyboard from @entity36 and did not start piano lessons until he was 14			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ i had never experienced anything that came so naturally			1
i found i could play a one - note melody accurately with my little arm - although anything with big chords was out of the question			2
i practised for hours and hours			0
‘ i vaguely knew how to read the notes from my compulsory music lessons at school , but i played a lot by ear at first : @entity51 sonatas , pieces by @entity53			2
‘ one day i had the volume quite loud and @entity60 called up : “ turn off the stereo , @entity62 ” , and i said : “ it ’s not the stereo			0
it ’s me on the keyboard			0
” there was silence from downstairs			0
my parents obviously realised something was happening			0
self - taught : playing the piano came ' so naturally ' and after teaching himself on a cheap keyboard , he started piano lessons when he was 14 ‘ it was then that i asked them for piano lessons … @entity73 and @entity60 never denied me an opportunity			2
’ the pianist had planned to become a chef but on hearing a piano sonata by @entity51 he was left ‘ dumbfounded ’ and changed his career path			1
he said : ‘ i just fell in love with it and decided that was what i wanted to do			0
i started playing around with the piano and found it came very naturally			0
’ when he was 17 - years - old he secured a place at the junior department of @entity19 ’s @entity87 , winning the annual piano prize			1
he then went on to the prestigious @entity5			1
professor @entity89 , the head of keyboard at the college , said he had been ‘ incredibly enterprising ’ in overcoming big challenges such as developing the stamina to present a 50 - minute recital with one arm			1
she said : ‘ he has been a great inspiration to many of his fellow students in showing what it is possible to achieve with a disability			0
’ he plays music written specifically for the left hand including works by @entity106 composer @entity105 who lost his right arm in the @entity109			1
mr @entity6 said : ‘ there is a lifetime ’s worth of work available			1
there are more challenges than for a two - handed pianist because you have to cover the whole piano			1
‘ it does sound like there are two hands playing			0
’ various other well - known composers such as @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 have written pieces for just the left hand which mr @entity6 plays at performances			1
he believes much of his audience is drawn in by curiosity			0
he said : ‘ for many , the first reaction is astonishment , that wow factor			0
i ’ve had some people who thought i ’d played with a backing track , but it is just me and my left hand			1
’ when he first joined the @entity15 , some of the sight - impaired musicians were unconvinced that mr @entity6 could play with only one hand			1
he said : ‘ when i first joined the orchestra , a couple of the musicians who are partially sighted and blind did n’t believe i was playing with one hand , that was a big compliment to me			2
welcomed @entity18 : mr @entity6 is part of the @entity15 , the country ¿ s first disabled orchestra , which played to welcome @entity18 athletes as they arrive in @entity19 ‘ the music is all written for the left hand alone , i ’m not changing anything , i ’m playing the music as it was written			1
‘ it ’s written very cleverly but you ’ve got to be very quick and good with the pedalling to sustain the bass notes while playing the top notes			2
’ his determination has allowed him to turn an apparent disadvantage into an advantage , learning to ride a bike and drive a car			0
mr @entity6 said : ‘ there are people in my position having counselling , and i just think : “ please get over it and make something of yourself ! ” last week he performed in @entity169 at the country ’s prime ministerial offices and on september 13 he will headline his first evening concert at @entity173 in @entity174			1
father @entity175 , a 46 - year - old salesman , always let his son do things that other said he could not do			2
he said : ‘ you can do two things when you have a disabled child			0
you either wrap them in cotton wool and pretend the world is n’t there or you make them do anything and everything			0
