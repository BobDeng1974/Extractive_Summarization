@entity0 knows how to pull off a great escape but the @entity3 boss insists there are no quick fixes to save the @entity6			1
they are bottom of the @entity8 at @entity9 ahead of the @entity11 visit of @entity12			1
only two sides have ever survived being bottom on december 25 - @entity15 last season and @entity17 in 2005			1
@entity0 knows how to pull off a great escape but the @entity3 boss insists there are no quick fixes and @entity0 was @entity21 's assistant when the @entity17 became the first team in @entity8 history to survive the traditional relegation			1
they stayed up on the final day of the 2004 - 05 season with the lowest ever points total to beat the drop , 34			2
now , @entity3 are winless in 12 games and five points from safety and @entity0 insisted they must match the @entity17 ' ethic and strength to survive			1
he said : ' you 're looking at strength of character and we made additions and key players came in then : @entity40 and @entity41 added to what was a really good group of people who had a common goal and worked exceptionally hard			0
@entity0 was @entity46 's assistant when the @entity17 avoided relegation in 2005 ' that 's always going to be the base line			1
' to win things you need those qualities , to avoid relegation you need those qualities			2
ability gets you so far , strength of character too , but it 's trying to get a balance of the two			0
' there is a desire and a willingness to look for the answers			0
there are no quick fixes in life , well there might be but they do n't have enough longevity			0
it 's about winning the next game , as it always has been for us			0
' @entity17 beat @entity70 2 - 0 on the final day in 2005 to send @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 down			1

@entity0 has highlighted the importance of his squad sticking together during the difficult months ahead ' i do n't think there 's any one recipe for dealing with these situations , ' he said			2
' my time at @entity17 was the lowest points total ever to stay up			2
' you can never be in control of the situation but there has to be a bit of clarity in your thinking			0
it 's important there 's a common goal and ultimately you need people to stay together			0
' you will hear other people talking about siege mentalities and utilising some negative aspects to galvanise you but it depends on the chemistry within your own club			0
' i do n't think there 's ever one absolute answer - it 's not like the @entity104			0
