a top @entity1 general has warned that president @entity2 must use the might of the @entity5 military to ‘ eradicate ’ @entity6 now – or risk paying the price later with more attacks on the @entity9			1
general @entity10 , who led international forces in @entity12 , warned that if @entity6 is allowed to build a stable base of power in @entity16 and @entity17 it will be able mount more attacks on @entity5 and @entity5 interests			1
he spoke out in @entity20 , days after the brutal execution of @entity22 – and on the day @entity23 admitted that the threat from @entity6 could surpass even that posed by @entity25			1
‘ they are beyond just a terrorist group			0
they marry ideology , a sophistication of ... military prowess			0
they are tremendously well - funded			0
this is beyond anything we 've seen			0
’ writing for the @entity20 website , @entity10 was quick to praise president @entity2 for the airstrikes he had already ordered on @entity6 camps in northern @entity16 , but he went on to urge the president to ‘ move quickly to pressure the organisations entire “ nervous system ” , break it up , and destroy its pieces			1
’ ‘ the @entity5 is now firmly in the game and remains the only nation on the planet capable of exerting the kind of strategic leadership , influence and strike capacity to deal with @entity61 , ’ he wrote			2
‘ it is also the only power capable of organizing a coalition ’s reaction to this regional and international threat			2
’ ‘ this group is not a flash in the pan that will go away of its own accord or if we do n’t poke at it			0
’ @entity10 did not propose a return to ground combat , but urged a ‘ focused advise and assist ’ mission to bolster @entity16 and @entity77 soldiers and non-jihadist @entity17 rebels , a commitment that would require a reintroduction of significantly more @entity5 military advisers			1
general @entity10 praised @entity2 for recent airstrikes , but urged him to ' move quickly to pressure the organisations entire " nervous system " ' he also warned that the threat from @entity6 was not something that was simply limited to the countries in the in @entity89 , but provided a very real treat in the western world too			1
@entity6 foot soldiers with @entity93 , @entity94 , and @entity5 passports pose a serious threat to all our safety , he warned - and the organization was clearly more advanced than @entity25			1
' it ’s worth remembering the @entity101 provided the perfect platform from which @entity25 attacked the @entity5 , and the @entity101 were and remain as cavemen in comparison to @entity6 , ' he wrote			2
general @entity10 denied that the @entity5 military was war weary and was fully capable of attacking and reducing @entity6			1
‘ we should do it now , but supported substantially by our traditional allies and partners , especially by those in the region who have the most to give – and the most to lose – if the @entity114 ’s march continues			0
' @entity10 wrote that @entity22 ’s killing ‘ embodies ’ the threat from @entity6 , which he called ‘ an entity beyond the pale of humanity ’			1
‘ if we delay now , we will pay later , ’ he warned			0
general @entity10 's comments came hours after secretary of defense @entity23 dramatically upgraded the @entity5 government 's estimation of the threats @entity5 faces from the terrorist organization			1
@entity6 is ' as sophisticated and well - funded as any group that we have seen , ' @entity32 told a group of reporters during a joint press conference he held with @entity131 chairman gen. @entity130			2
' they 're beyond just a terrorist @entity134 marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
they are tremendously well funded			0
... this is beyond anything we 've seen , so we must prepare for everything			0
' ' and the only way you do that is that you take a cold , steely , hard look at it and – and – and get ready			0
' grave threat : secretary of defense @entity23 and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general @entity130 at the press conference where they delivered the dire warning not just airstrikes : @entity32 and @entity130 said that much of @entity5 's long - term involvement in @entity16 will continue to consist of assistance to @entity16 's nascent government as it trains volunteers like these @entity159 , who have joined the battle against @entity6 battling @entity6 ' is going to be a very long contest , ' @entity131 chairman gen. @entity130 warned on thursday ' it 's a long - term threat , ' he conceded under questioning from reporters , adding moments later that ' the president has been very clear on mission creep			1
and he 's made it very clear that he will not allow that			0
' gen. @entity130 warned that @entity5 's involvement in @entity16 will continue for years to come , citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic , religious and tribal groups there			1
' the conflict against those groups – most of which are local , some of which are regional , and some of which are global in nature – that 's going to be a very long contest , ' he said			0
it 's religious in many cases			0
so , yes , it 's going to be a very long contest			0
' at the same time the decorated general cautioned that the ' required participation ' of the @entity5 would remain one of coalition leadership ' to provide the unique capabilities that we provide , but not necessarily all the capabilities ' – a suggestion that an unlimited release of military might to crush @entity6 is off the table			1
@entity130 added later in the briefing that @entity6 ca n't practically be contained in @entity16 , since it also has deep roots and tremendous resources across the @entity17 border			1
forget about @entity205 : @entity207 deputy spokeswoman @entity206 said thursday that the @entity5 does not ' make concessions to terrorists ' – including the payment of ransom for the safe return of kidnapped hostages the terror group ' has an apocalyptic end - of - days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated , ' the general explained			1
' can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in @entity17 ? the answer is no. that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border			2
' @entity32 fielded a question about whether future @entity5 military action could include a direct focus on @entity17 , answering : ' we continue to explore all options			1
' as @entity5 military action expands in @entity16 , he said , much of that help is in the form of ' a tremendous amount of military assistance to the @entity238 through the @entity16 security forces			1
' ' there 's no question that we have been accelerated – as a matter of fact , all year long , we have been accelerated – [ through ] all the requests made by the @entity16 government for lethal assistance and equipment , and we continue to do that			2
he downplayed the long - term strategic value of the limited airstrikes that president @entity2 has authorized , saying that in the long term they could be just a table - setter			2
defeating @entity6 ' is n't going to just come as a result of airstrikes , ' @entity32 said			2
' strategically , there are limits to how much you can accomplish with airstrikes			0
tactically , you can accomplish a significant amount			0
i think we 've seen that			0
' @entity6 will only truly be defeated when it 's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised sunni that happen to reside between @entity270 and @entity271 , ' he explained			2
' it requires a variety of instruments , only one small part of which is airstrikes			0
i 'm not predicting those will occur in @entity17 , at least not by the @entity5			2
but it requires the application of all of the tools of national power – diplomatic , economic , information , military			0
' @entity32 and @entity130 also discussed a failed mission to rescue @entity5 photojournalist @entity22 and other @entity6 hostages this summer			1
an @entity6 militant with a @entity93 accent beheaded @entity22 this week in a shocking video that rocketed across the @entity288 , blaming @entity2 for airstrikes against @entity6 positions in northern @entity16			1
earlier on thursday , @entity207 deputy spokeswoman @entity206 told reporters that winning @entity22 's return by paying off @entity6 was never an option , and that ' the @entity294 did not have contact with ' @entity6 after a warning came that @entity22 would be killed if airstrikes continued			1
' we do not make concessions to terrorists , ' she said			0
' that includes – we do not pay ransoms			0
' ' one of the main ways @entity305 [ @entity306 ] has been funded throughout this conflict has been from ransom payments that others have paid			0
we believe just in 2014 that that ’s in the millions of dollars			0
' end of the world : the terror group ' has an apocalyptic end - of - days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated , ' @entity130 explained @entity315 @entity22 : the journalist , dressed in @entity318 - style orange clothing , was killed on - camera by a masked @entity320 belonging to @entity6 , who beheaded him with a short knife ' so we believe that paying ransoms or making concessions , ' @entity206 said , ' would both put our – all @entity5 overseas – at greater risk for kidnapping and in harm ’s way , but that ransoms would also fund and finance exactly the groups we are trying to degrade their capabilities			1
' @entity206 did not address the recent return of @entity336 sgt. @entity205 from @entity101 forces , which was achieved through a prison swap that required the release of five high - value @entity101 @entity340 from the @entity5 military detention facility at @entity342 , @entity343			1
the @entity2 administration seems to be treating @entity6 as a completely different animal			1
' this is not about @entity305 [ @entity306 ] versus the @entity5 , ' @entity206 said thursday			2
' they are killing anyone who gets in their way – @entity351 , @entity159 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity16 , @entity17 – anyone who gets in their way , and now an @entity5			1
so this is not about what the @entity5 is or is n’t doing			2
this is about @entity6 ’s stated commitment to murder , rape , enslave people who do n’t agree with their ideology			0

general @entity10 is the latest military leader to speak out against the growing threat of @entity6
@entity10 , who led international forces in @entity12 , said the @entity5 had to ' eradicate ' the terrorism organization now - or risk attacks in the future
he praised @entity2 for recent airstrikes , but urged him to ' move quickly to pressure the organisations entire " nervous system " '
@entity10 's comments come the same day as defense secretary @entity23 warned of the threat from @entity6
terror network in @entity16 and @entity17 is ' an imminent threat to every interest we have , ' he said
tensions are high in the @entity2 administration following a *gruesome* video showing an @entity320 beheading @entity5 journalist @entity22
