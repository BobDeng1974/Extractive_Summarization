on a gloomy november afternoon , i helped carry the inexpensive wooden casket of @entity2 to a grave on a slight rise dotted with dying grass			1
with no mourners around to serve as pallbearers , it was a task that fell to me and a few other reporters covering the funeral of @entity12 's assassin			1
fifty years later , i remain a reluctant and minor footnote in @entity15 history			2
it was a story that began with a tip : @entity2 would be buried at @entity18 in @entity19 , where he had spent part of his childhood , just one day after nightclub owner @entity22 shot and killed him during a jail transfer on nov. 24 , 1963 , itself just two days after @entity12 's death			1
as the @entity19 correspondent for @entity27 , i drew the assignment			2
@entity27 reporter @entity35 is pictured holding his notepad , front i arrived to discover dozens of police and federal agents , writers and photographers , but no mourners waiting to bid @entity2 goodbye or good riddance			1
a police escort delivered @entity2 's casket in the early afternoon			1
much later , officers arrived with his family : mother @entity48 , brother @entity49 , widow @entity50 and her two daughters , @entity53 , 2 , and infant @entity54			1
no one else would follow ; even the minister failed to show			0
shaking his head ever so slightly , @entity58 of the @entity59 turned to me and said , ' @entity35 , if we 're gon na write a story about the burial of @entity2 , we 're gon na have to bury the son of a bitch ourselves			1
' sure enough , officials asked the gathered reporters to serve as pallbearers			1
i was among the first they asked , my reply not just ' no ! ' but ' hell no ! ' today : @entity35 , pictured at his home in @entity71 , @entity72 , said he initially said ' hell no ! ' to carrying the coffin then @entity74 of @entity75 stepped forward and volunteered , and with my top competition for scoops accepting the duty , i realized my error and joined @entity74 and other reporters			1
the ceremony itself was as brief as it was simple			0
the rev. @entity83 , executive secretary of the @entity84 , had been drafted to fill in for the missing minister			0
his words - ' we are not here to judge , only to commit for burial @entity2 - were barely audible , mingled with muffled sobs by @entity2 's mother and widow			1
her eyes red and swollen , @entity93 stepped beside her husband 's casket and quietly whispered something			2
not long after the nation 's slain president was laid to rest at @entity101 with tearful family members and millions of television viewers around the world looking on , @entity2 's body was lowered into his grave at 4.28pm			1
surreal : he holds a photograph showing him carrying the casket 50 years ago beside other reporters making history : @entity35 uses a magnifying glass to highlight his face along with the other reporters for years , i would continue to report on the assassination , interviewing @entity2 's mother , investigating conspiracy theories and writing stories on the anniversary of that dreadful day in @entity119			1
for one of the first of those anniversary stories , i wanted to interview @entity2 's widow			1
she had remarried , moved to suburban @entity119 and rarely spoke to reporters			2
her new husband had reportedly brandished a pistol and chased one writer away			0
early on a cloudy november morning , i staked out their house and trudged up the steps after he left for work			0
i had not called ahead , but identified myself as an @entity27 reporter when @entity93 opened the door			0
' i am no longer news , ' she said , making it clear she did not intend to talk with me			0
she was slim and blonde , with arresting eyes of an intense blue - green and a distinctive @entity141 accent			2
she was 24 and i must have stared like a smitten dolt			0
empty : only his widow @entity93 , his brother , mother and two children had attended to the funeral overwhelmed : @entity50 is pictured at the funeral			1
years later when @entity35 knocked on her door for an interview and told her he had been there that day , the long - silent widow welcomed him inside ' is something wrong ? ' she asked			1
embarrassed , i babbled something about not having seen her since that day at @entity18			2
' you were there ? ' she asked			0
i told her i was a pallbearer			0
surprised , she said the least she could do was invite me in for coffee			0
several hours later , we were still talking and smoking			0
denied cigarettes by @entity2 during their marriage , she was now a chain smoker			2
' have you ever tried to analyze yourself ? ' she asked me at one point , then added : it 's very hard to do			2
' killed : @entity2 was arrested for shooting dead president @entity12 on november 22 , 1963 as he drove through @entity119 , @entity72			1
@entity2 was shot dead two days later as he was transferred to a jail asked about the @entity171 's conclusion that her husband was the lone assassin , she said : ' i think about it a lot			1
it is like a nightmare			0
' years later , in 1983 , when working on a story about the 20th anniversary , i interviewed @entity93 for the second and last time			0
she was no less candid and still a heavy smoker			0
' for a while i thought it would all blow over , just go away , ' she said			0
' but now i accept the fact that i must live with this the rest of my life			0
' i may still be naive , but i 'm not stupid			0

@entity35 was sent to @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity72 to report on the funeral - but no mourners turned up to carry the casket
officials asked reporters on the scene to step up and @entity35 initially thought ' hell no ! ' until he realized his competitors had agreed to do it
years after , @entity2 's widow @entity50 turned @entity35 down for an interview - before learning that he had been at the funeral too
