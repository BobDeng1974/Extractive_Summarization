the former defence secretary dismissed @entity9 ’s ‘ absurd ’ plans as a form of ‘ social engineering ’ that is ‘ divisive , ill - thought - through and constitutionally wrong ’			1
in a letter seen by the @entity13 , dr @entity1 said same - sex unions will alienate @entity16 members and weaken the @entity17			2
he warned that pressing ahead with plans to introduce gay marriage is enraging ‘ sections of the @entity22 public who are not normally stirred to political anger ’ , and called for a rethink before ‘ things get out of hand ’			1
the one - time @entity16 leadership contender said the determination of mr @entity9 and other senior ministers to push through legislation this spring ‘ smacks of a form of social engineering of which conservatives should be instinctively wary ’			1
of the consequences of the policy , he wrote : ‘ it has led to the alienation of many loyal and , in many cases lifelong , supporters of the @entity16			0
’ he added that the claim by @entity48 that @entity50 courts would not be able to force religious groups into conducting same sex weddings ‘ carries little credibility with those of us who have watched similar assurances trounced in the past ’			2
dr @entity1 also issued a coded criticism of mr @entity9 for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters			1

however , he denounced proposals to ‘ change the definition of marriage for all ’ , claiming that there is no ‘ clamour ’ for the change from homosexuals			2
he also said plans to allow gay marriage in some religious denominations while exempting the @entity17 were ‘ anomalous and absurd ’			2
‘ the idea of making certain practices illegal for one @entity91 church , but not others , risks further weakening and splintering @entity22 ’s traditional religion at a time when many @entity91 feel that they are under threat on a number of secular , political and cultural fronts , ’ he continued			0
‘ to fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent			0
’ dr @entity1 also issued a coded criticism of mr @entity9 for pushing the reforms as a way of winning back floating voters dr @entity1 rejected the charge levelled at mr @entity9 by some @entity111 that he has deliberately pursued gay marriage to antagonise the @entity113 of the party as ‘ far - fetched ’ , but concluded : ‘ i believe these proposals are divisive , ill - thought - through and constitutionally wrong			1

‘ and it ’s that secure environment which gives children the best chance of prospering			0
’ he added : ‘ society has a duty to create the circumstances in which those civil institutions can flourish			0
’ a spokesman for mr @entity9 said : ‘ the prime minister is a strong advocate of gay marriage and this does n’t change everything			1
