the drama happened on monday evening just seconds after the @entity32 registered jet had taken off from @entity34 's malpensa airport bound for the @entity36 capital of @entity37 with 174 passengers and six crew onboard			1
it had reached a take off speed of more than 200mph when it lifted off the runway and the engine cover fell away seconds later - creating a potential disaster for other jets - in 2000 a @entity48 crashed in @entity49 after one of its tyres was punctured by debris lost from a previous plane			0
holidaymaker @entity55 , from @entity56 , who was on the @entity5 flight with his girlfriend , posted on his @entity60 site , how the engine cover came away in front of his eyes			2
he wrote : ' we had just taken off and i looked out the window and saw this piece of metal fly off			0
' it fell away right in front of my eyes and i started screaming ' a piece of the wing has gone flying ' the cabin crew came and had a look and then one went to tell the captain			0
he came over the @entity78 system a few minutes later and said there had been a problem and we were turning back			0
' we were circling for twenty minutes before we landed again and the crew were trying to keep everybody calm but it was an experience i do n't want to go through again			0
' unfolded : the drama happened on monday evening just seconds after the @entity32 registered jet had taken off from @entity34 's malpensa airport bound for the @entity36 capital of @entity37 with 174 passengers and six crew onboard passengers held their breathe as the plane touched down safely with the airport closed while maintenance teams cleared the debris from the runway which had also been spotted falling away by the control tower			1
