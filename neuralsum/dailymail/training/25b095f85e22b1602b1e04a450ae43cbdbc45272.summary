it broke to @entity1 , 30 yards out and all alone ; the @entity2 sauntered up before unleashing the sort of effort stunning for its sereneness rather than overriding power			1
tuesday night 's finish - away at @entity8 in a game @entity10 cruised through - ranks as one of the best in @entity15 history			1
but where does it stand against the net - bulgers and fluent team moves witnessed since the competition 's inception ? @entity22 takes a look			1
@entity1 celebrates after scoring his second goal of the night against @entity8 20			1
@entity25 ( @entity26 vs @entity27 - 2000 ) just look at that @entity29 flick			2
the big @entity30 held off his marker on the edge of the box , waiting for the onrushing @entity25 - who 'd started the move in midfield - and the striker poked home in the @entity39			2
@entity25 was as cool as you like as he swept @entity26 into a lead away at @entity27 back in 2000 19			0
@entity42 ( @entity43 vs @entity44 - 1997 ) the opening game of the 1997 @entity15 , and @entity43 set about gaining points			0
@entity44 attacked , the hosts broke and there was @entity42 - he of @entity50 fame latterly - to scream in an effort from 30 yards			0
@entity52 ( @entity53 vs @entity54 - 2006 ) this was beauty personified			0
the @entity57 stood over the ball at a hushed @entity59 with the scores goalless before sending that pocket of @entity63 wild as they beat sir @entity64 's @entity54			0
@entity52 bent a wicked free - kick over the @entity54 wall at @entity59 in 2006 17			0
@entity68 ( @entity67 vs @entity69 - 1994 ) two to the good in the @entity15 final , @entity68 put the game beyond @entity69 with a wonderfully weighted lob before @entity74 wrapped up a 4 - 0 win			0
@entity67 's @entity68 celebrates scoring his team 's third goal against @entity69 in the 1994 final 16			1
@entity80 ( @entity79 vs @entity81 - 2012 ) back to goal , @entity80 only needed one touch to take himself beyond @entity85 and @entity86 before bending a wicked effort into @entity89 's top corner			1
@entity80 had clipped the ball beyond @entity85 before this effort soared into the @entity81 net in 2012 15			0
@entity93 ( @entity94 vs @entity81 - 1997 ) the break was one in the ' 97 final , but @entity93 did n't have an awful lot of options			0
thirty - five yards out , he opted to audaciously chip @entity100 in the @entity81 goal and clinch victory for the @entity103 ( and @entity104 )			0
@entity93 scored this 35 - yard lob as @entity94 went on to clinch the 1997 @entity15 title 14			1
@entity107 ( @entity10 vs @entity108 - 2005 ) nudge the ball out of his feet running the wrong way , stopping in his tracks and curling a shot with the outside of his foot across the goalkeeper			1
@entity107 was in an improvising mood as he swept an effort home for @entity10 at @entity108 13			1
@entity123 ( @entity54 vs @entity124 - 2000 ) what a team goal this was			1
pass , pass , pass			0
thirty later and @entity123 caps a glorious move with a deft lob			1
what @entity54 fans would now give ... @entity123 finished off the @entity54 move with this deft lob against the @entity134 12			1
@entity135 ( @entity136 vs @entity137 - 2013 ) you could quite easily compile one of these lists for @entity135 himself , but this has to be his best @entity143 strike			1
a few strides before viciously lashing home from way out			0
@entity135 plundered home this effort against @entity137 in @entity148 last season 11			1
@entity150 ( @entity69 vs @entity151 - 2001 ) there have n't been many better teams goals scored in the @entity15 and this was all the more impressive given @entity69 were away at @entity155			2
@entity150 dances beyond @entity151 's @entity157 goalkeeper @entity156 in november 2001 10			0
@entity158 ( @entity159 vs @entity160 - 1999 ) technique , poise and power : the best goal @entity158 ever scored			2
a long direct ball from halfway dropped over the @entity167 's shoulder and he volleyed left - footed across the goalkeeper into the top corner			2
@entity1 ( @entity10 vs @entity8 - 2014 ) so this is where @entity1 's effort makes @entity22 's top 20 - a goal @entity10 fans will be talking about for some time			1
@entity175 ( @entity69 vs @entity176 - 2011 ) @entity175 's individual brillince is unquestioned , but the magnitude of this @entity179 makes his slaloming run through the @entity176 defence all the more elegant			1
@entity175 completed his weaving run at @entity176 by sliding beyond @entity183 in 2011 7			2
@entity184 ( @entity136 vs @entity185 - 1994 ) never a man to appear rushed , @entity184 beat a number of the @entity103 defence at his own pace before firing beyond keeper @entity190 at his near post			0
@entity184 gallops over a @entity185 defender on his way to scoring a brilliant solo goal 6			0
@entity196 ( @entity195 vs @entity197 - 2011 ) an example of @entity199 getting his rush goalkeeping role wrong but @entity196 still had to control a volley from the halfway line to get the ball above the stopper and into the @entity206 net			0
@entity196 wheels away after scoring from the halfway line against @entity199 's @entity197 5			0
@entity209 ( @entity54 vs @entity44 - 2009 ) forty yards from goal away from home , three yards of space and only one outcome			1
@entity209 scored from way out when @entity54 played at @entity44 five years ago 4			1
@entity216 ( @entity176 vs @entity217 - 2002 ) another goal from a final and this was superb			1
from a standing start , @entity216 took @entity222 ' looped cross on with his wrong foot and volleyed in at @entity224			2
@entity216 's volley in the 2002 final at @entity224 is one of the greatest ever scored 3			1
@entity229 ( @entity228 vs @entity185 - 2004 ) potentially the greatest free - kick taker of all time , @entity229 beat @entity190 from 35 yards with a shot which was forever above the line of the crossbar and had the goalkeeper sprawling so far to his left that he bashed his head on the post			0
@entity228 's players celebrate with @entity240 @entity229 after his thumping free - kick away at @entity185 2			2
@entity242 ( @entity69 vs @entity79 - 2005 ) just marvel at the footwork			1
on the edge of the box at @entity246 , desperately needing a goal at 3 - 1 down , the @entity240 shimmied his right foot this way and that before clipping a ball around @entity253			0
@entity242 had @entity254 completed bamboozled by his footwork at @entity246 in 2005 1			2
@entity256 ( @entity257 vs @entity69 - 1999 ) the ultimate display of control			0
there a ball broke just inside the @entity69 final third during a scrappy piece of play and the midfielder - who only found the net twice for @entity257 - performed a stunning bicycle kick to tee up a six - goal thriller			0
@entity270 and @entity271 scored for the visitors as the teams drew 3 - 3 in the group stage			2
@entity275 here to @entity278 's facebook page .			0
