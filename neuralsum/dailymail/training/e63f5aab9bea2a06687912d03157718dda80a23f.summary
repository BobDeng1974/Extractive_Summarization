these entertaining monster sandwich sculptures are painstakingly made from bread and various sandwich fillings , including sausage meat , olives , peppers and cheese			2
the funny characters have been so well received in the art world that some have even been commissioned for tv - shirt prints			1
good enough to eat : at first they will make you laugh and then , perhaps , feel a little hungry skewered : @entity21 artist @entity20 's monster sandwiches have proven so popular they have been commissioned for tv - shirt prints @entity21 artist @entity20 , 29 , made her first sandwich - saurus while at design college			1
but it took a couple of years before she decided to make a collection of edible monsters and now devotes much of her time to her hobby			0
@entity20 said : ' i had the idea when i was going to design school in @entity33			1
i wanted to make something unique and i 've always loved food art , so i made a @entity36 as a one - time thing			0
' then a couple of years later , i stumbled upon that picture and decided i should be doing more with sandwiches than just eating them			0
i 've been making a few monsters a month ever since			2
double act : the funny creations started off as a college project for artist @entity20 in demand : the amusing creations have proven so popular that @entity20 is now being commissioned to make them for tv - shirt prints baguette head : it can take up to an hour to make a sandwich monster , but once completed , they do n't last long , and are quickly eaten by herself and her fiance ' i have n't sold the sandwiches as food , only as commissioned art prints			1
people tell me i should open a deli - which would be fine as long as my customers do n't mind waiting an hour or two for their lunch			0
' @entity20 said her life is always full of new sandwich ideas			1
what 's lurking inside your bacon and cheese bagel ? the olive eyes have it : while meat and cheese are ' versatile , easy to manipulate , and delicious ' @entity20 says she loves to use olives for eyes always experimenting with new ideas , @entity20 likes to create scenes with her funny creations she said : ' i get excited finding new types of bread and fillings to work with , but my favourite ingredients are meat and cheese because they just seem inherently funny to me			1
' plus they 're versatile , easy to manipulate , and delicious			0
i also love the olive eyes			0
they give a consistency to my sandwiches , although i am considering branching out to new eyeball materials			0
amusing : @entity20 's creations keep evolving , she says , as she comes up with new ideas every day this rare piece is a copy of popular kids ' character @entity96 - an exception among @entity20 's collection of scary and funny monsters i 've made almost 50 monsters			1
the ideas are coming quicker to me and i 'm getting faster at it , so lately i 've making more and more			2
' building a sandwich can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours			0
then i can spend up to an hour shooting them in various positions and settings			0
' i try to get done taking pictures as quickly as possible because as soon as they 're done , they get to go to my belly - unless my fiance beats me to it			0
' irony : this clever design shows an @entity116 hot dog man , grilling sausages on a barbeque many of @entity20 's creations appear to represent stereotypes from different nations			1
can you guess which one this is ? fill me in : a smorgasbord of ingredients is used adorn and stuff her her sandwiches , which are usually happily consumed by her fiance while some of the sandwich monsters are funny , others are simply bizarre , but equally as appetising			1

it started off as a college design project
now it has turned into a *business* - making sandwich monsters for t - shirt designs
@entity21 artist @entity20 , 29 , says she 's constantly thinking of new monster ideas
