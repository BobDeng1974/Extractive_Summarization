@entity7 , 60 , ( with fiance @entity17 ) had most of the left side of his face removed after he was diagnosed with an aggressive tennis - ball sized tumour @entity7 and fiance @entity17 , pictured on a night out before @entity7 's cancer , which was discovered at an advanced stage during a routine operation for four years , he had to be fed through a tube directly into his stomach and was unable to speak clearly @entity7 was fitted with a new prostethic face after appearing on @entity28 's @entity27 with fiance @entity17 but four years later , after appearing on @entity28 ’s @entity27 , mr @entity7 has been fitted with a new prosthetic face and is planning to marry his fiance @entity30 , 48			1
his new face - believed to be the first of its kind in the @entity34 - was made using pioneering 3d printing technology			1
this uses scans to build images of how his face should look - using a mirror image of the undamaged side of the face			2
the new 3d printer then built a nylon mould of his face layer by layer - and this was used to create a silicon prosthesis			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity49 , @entity50 , was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma - which occurs when small growths called polyps grow into tumours - four years ago			1
by the time the lump was discovered - during a routine operation to remove nasal polyps - the cancer was very advanced			0
in order to save his life , surgeons at @entity60 removed his left eye , cheekbone and most of his jaw			1
as a result , he had to be fed through a feeding tube and had to hold his face still to be able to talk			2
he was referred to dental surgeon , @entity69 who used digital scanning technology to scan his face mr @entity69 created scans of what was left of @entity7 's skull and then used computers to create a mirror image of the unaffected side of the face to show what his face would look like with a prosthesis mr @entity7 told @entity80 : ' when i went in for the emergency surgery , i never expected to have so much of my face removed			1
' when i woke up from thought " i 'm never going to get my face back again "			2
it was so shocked that it did n't sink in for a while			2
' but in the weeks and months that followed , he felt increasingly depressed about his appearance and quality of life			0
' i could n't eat as food just came out of the side of my face - and i had to hold my mouth to talk , ' he said			1
' i felt very depressed as could n't see how anything was ever going to change			2
i did n't want to get out of bed			2
' mr @entity69 then used 3d printing technology to create a nylon plastic mould from which he could create the silicon prosthesis eventually , in desperation , the couple decided to visit dr @entity102 on embarrassing bodies to see if there was any hope			1
mr @entity7 was referred to dental surgeon @entity69 , at @entity106 and @entity107 in @entity108			1
mr @entity69 created a mouth implant ( pictured ) which creates a seal meaning that @entity7 can eat and drink again mr @entity69 used digital scanning technology to scan mr @entity7 ’s face			1
he then used digital software to create a model of the unaffected side of his face			2
from this model , he was able to use 3d printing technology to create a mirror image of the undamaged side of the face			1
the new 3d printer then built a nylon mould of his face layer by layer - and this was then used to create a silicon prosthesis			1
mr @entity7 now wears the facial prosthesis and a mouth implant which is used to separate the mouth from the hole in his face			1
this creates a seal which means he can eat and drink again			1
the prosthesis is supported by titanium scaffolding that is held in place by screws in his eyebrow and in his other cheek bone , mr @entity69 told @entity80			1
magnets help secure the silicon mask in place and make it easy to remove at night			2
since having the prosthesis fitted , mr @entity7 has eaten his first meal in five years - @entity146 and hot milk			1
he said : ' i have lost my sense of smell , but i could still taste some of it			2
and i no longer have to hold my mouth to talk any more			0
it 's transformed my life			2
' it is a great feeling to look in the mirror and see a whole face again			0
i am amazed at what they have done - it just looks so like me			0
i also have something to look forward to , as @entity17 and i are planning to finally get married this summer			1
' @entity7 can now eat , drink and speak clearly again and is awaiting further treatment to add teeth to his implant describing the moment when the prosthesis was fitted , ms @entity30 said : ‘ it was unbelievable , i ’ve got him back			1
3d printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file			0
they work in an extremely simple way , by building up a 3d object from layers of material			0
like a traditional inkjet printer , material , usually plastic , is laid down on a base			0
further layers are simply printed on top , gradually revealing a 3d object			0
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
shoes , jewellery and even dresses have been created , with designs often sold online			0
many believe it could even lead to ' mini factories ' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance			0
‘ hopefully he can now go out with his friends to the pub ; it will give him a real confidence boost			0
’ she added : ' his appearance before did n't bother me			0
who i fell in love with is in here , this bit is just the outside			0
he has n't changed on the inside			0
‘ @entity7 is now completely cured of the cancer so you have to take some things to gain others			1
' it is so good to see him happy again and what it has done for his confidence			0
' people did stare at him before but i think the main problem was he felt so low , he did n't want to get out of bed			0
now , he is out in the garden and is happy to go out to the shops			0
' she added : ‘ it ’s not been easy			0
i have down days but family support helps me and my granddaughter @entity233 brightens up my days			0
‘ she is great with @entity7 , she is only three and never frightened of him , it ’s remarkable			1
’ the next stage of mr @entity7 ’s treatment will see him return to mr @entity69 ’s clinic where he will have teeth fitted to his implant			2
he will even receive a prosthesis in a darker tone for summer , when his skin tans			0
ms @entity30 added : ‘ we want to tell our story and show others that life is n’t all doom and gloom and that there are ways of curing these things ; there is a light at the end of the tunnel			0
