the @entity1 family served to form a further wedge between themselves and @entity5 ’s fans after a pensioner was forced to pay a staggering £ 20,000 in damages for allegations made online			1
@entity9 , a lifelong supporter of the @entity10 , was ordered to make a public apology after posting a disparaging status on his @entity14 page this time last year			1
@entity9 currently has 34 friends on his private account and this is the third instance in a matter of months whereby a fan of the club has settled before court proceedings with owner @entity1 and his son , chairman @entity23			1
@entity5 fans vent their disgust at the @entity27 family , who own the club , last week supporters have been protesting against the @entity29 before matches and then not attending the games another supporter is awaiting a court date with the @entity29 after making defamatory remarks online			1
@entity35 is to soon find out his fate for branding a fan a ‘ retard ’ before @entity42 , telling him to ‘ enjoy your special needs day out ’ and claiming he was banned from the ground because he was a ‘ p * * * * ’			0
@entity5 ’s recent history has been entrenched in bitter disputes off the pitch , with paying customers regularly protesting at the ownership of their club			1
that was compounded last week when @entity51 and his team ’s relegation to @entity54 was confirmed			0
dozens pelted the @entity57 reception with eggs and flares before their draw against @entity61 last tuesday			0
@entity5 chairman @entity35 speaks on his mobile phone during tuesday 's draw with @entity61 owner @entity1 watches the match huddled under a blanket in the stands @entity5 fan @entity9 posted an apology on a supporters ' messageboard on thursday a group also travelled to the @entity27 home near @entity72 , @entity73 on sunday to vent their fury			1
members of the family stood within the grounds and watched as they protested in front of the gates			0
and @entity9 ’s apology will only serve to exasperate the problem further			1
posting on a fans ’ messageboard , the pensioner said : ‘ i now regret making these allegations , i fully accept that they are false and i wish to sincerely apologise for them and also for the harm , distress and financial losses my comments have caused both @entity92 and the @entity29 and i wish to unreservedly withdraw them			2
‘ i accept that my publication of the allegations on @entity14 and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel			2
it has injured the reputation of the @entity29 and has caused them considerable embarrassment and distress			0
@entity5 's main reception at @entity57 was pelted with eggs before their game with @entity61 broken eggs on the floor outside @entity57 ‘ it has damaged their reputation in business and it is considered to be grossly defamatory of the position of the @entity112 , within the football hierarchy and within the football community in general , as well as within the local community for it to be even suggested that either or both of the @entity29 were not only aware of such alleged activities but also that either or both of the @entity29 actually condoned them			2
‘ in recognition of this , i have agreed with their suggestion that i should pay to @entity92 , by way of damages , costs , disbursements and interest and in full and final settlement of all matters in issue between myself and @entity92 and the @entity29 , the sum of £ 20,000.00			2
‘ after a frank discussion with the @entity29 , i acknowledge that they are both genuine fans of @entity92 and they and their families have only the best interests of @entity92 at heart			0
i recognise that @entity92 is now in a significantly healthier situation than when the @entity1 family first became involved in it			0
i note that the combined net assets value at cost of @entity142 and @entity92 were £ 32 million as at may 2014 , compared with - £ 42,000 as at may 1987 , when the @entity29 took over @entity92			0
i accept the @entity27 family ’s main objective is and always has been , for the financial stability and success for and of @entity92			0
