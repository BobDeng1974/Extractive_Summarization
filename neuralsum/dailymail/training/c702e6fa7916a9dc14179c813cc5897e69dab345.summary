by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:37 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 11:10 est , 4 september 2012 @entity2 was devastated when doctors found cancerous cells in his nose three years ago and he was faced with a choice between radiotherapy or face disfiguring surgery to remove a cancerous tumour			1
the doctors recommended surgery as his best chance and so mr @entity2 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , underwent an operation to remove his nose and top lip and six weeks ago he was fitted with a prosthetic nose made out of silicone and held onto his face using magnets			1
determined not to let his deformity bring him down @entity2 , who now has the all clear , has been using his wicked sense of humour to keep his spirits up , even using his magnetic nose as a fridge magnet to make sure he does n't misplace it			1
@entity2 has been fitted with a magnetic nose following nasal surgery appearing on this morning today with his wife @entity30 says that it is a sense of humour that has helped him and his family get through the past few years			1
he said : '' you do n't know what you are capable of until you have to go through it			2
' it was devastating to hear the diagnosis , like the bottom had dropped out of the world			1
' when people hear cancer they think " i 'm dead " ' ' after the shock i said i am going to banish negative thinking from this house , we have to be positive			2
' i have always had a sense of humour , and you have to laugh in a situation like this			2
' now i have the perfect face for radio			2
' @entity2 shows this morning 's @entity57 and @entity58 how easy it is to remove his new nose the nose is made of silicone and mini metal poles and @entity2 uses @entity63 to smooth it on to his face ' it is really sturdy ! ' @entity66 holds the prosthetic nose @entity2 's wife @entity68 , 62 , said : ' his sense of humour carried us through , listening to him being so positive and funny at times made me think : we can win this			1
' we had no intention of crumbling			2
' the nose is made of silicone and attached with two magnets , and @entity2 demonstrated how easy it was to take on and off by handing it to a surprised @entity57 live on air , asking : ' do you want to feel ? can you wipe it for me while you have got it ? ' @entity57 said : ' it is really sturdy ! ' mr @entity2 admitted that he was almost unable to look at himself in the mirror before getting his new nose and thanked the prosthetic surgeons who created it before joking to @entity57 : ' my story is not to be sniffed at			1
' novel storage : the prosthetic nose has magnets that attach to magnetic studs implanted in mr @entity2 's face - this also means it easily sticks to the fridge in his kitchen speaking about the magnetic nose earlier last week he said : ' my new nose has given me a new lease of life but i was so worried we would lose it			1
' after repeatedly buying fridge magnets as souvenirs from his holidays , mr @entity2 came up with a brainwave and now sticks his prosthetic nose alongside the others on the side of the fridge freezer before he goes to bed			1
' i used to wear my nose to bed when i first got it , but one night it fell off and landed in one of my slippers , when i got up in the middle of the night , i stood on my own nose			2
i got the shock of my life			0
keeping it safe : @entity2 wearing his prosthetic nose which was fitted last month ' it was only when i noticed the fridge magnets in our kitchen that i thought i would test out whether my new nose would stick to the side too			1
' now if i ’m cooking dinner , sometimes i ’ll just stick my nose on the fridge next to the magnets because i do n’t know when my nose is running and i would n’t want anything going into the food			1
' or if i ’m at a party with my friends , i ’ll maybe stick it on the fridge just to lighten things up			0
i ca n’t wait for the next time we go on holiday and go through security because i ’ll have to take my nose off - i bet they wo n’t have seen that before			2
' mr @entity2 was diagnosed with nasal cancer in 2009 , after noticing growths on his face			1
he said : ' for a year i had two scabs at the entry of each nostril , which i assumed were cold sores			0
i just used to pick them off - i did n’t think it was anything serious			0
' the sores were swabbed and @entity2 was prescribed antibiotics but in february 2009 , he was transferred to @entity156 for a biopsy where he was diagnosed with cancer			1
mr @entity2 , who lives with wife @entity68 , an accounts manager said : ' i felt like i was in a dream , you always know someone with cancer but you never think you ’ll be the one to get it			1
' it was such a blow - i had been made redundant the month before , so it was already a difficult time			2
' mr @entity2 , who has seven grandchildren , was told the operation would be the most effective treatment so he agreed to go for it - even though his face would never be the same			1
replacement : mr @entity2 waited more than three years for his new nose , and it was fitted last month result : ' i burst into tears when i saw it for the first time - it looked so real ' , said mr @entity2 he said : ' i was told it would leave me very disfigured but would be the best option to fight the disease			1
it was life or death - so i did n’t care about losing my nose			2
' i wanted to carry on living and see my grandchildren grow up , that ’s what was important to me			0
i must have sat in the car outside the house for 40 minutes thinking of ways to break the news to my wife			2
' she burst into tears - she was n’t expecting it			0
she phoned our family who came round , it was very emotional			0
they were all so positive and told me they were behind me			0
' mr @entity2 on his 60th birthday before surgery mr @entity2 underwent the operation to remove his nose and most of his upper lip on april 16 , 2009 , before receiving four weeks of radiotherapy in june			1
he said : ' it was all very quick - i was home the next day			0
i was looked after by a fantastic team of nurses who would come to change the dressing - i ca n’t praise them enough			0
' the dressing was removed every day until it healed - but i just could n’t force myself to look at it			0
' although mr @entity2 had the confidence to go out with friends and to the shops within two weeks of his operation , it took him six months to look at himself in a mirror			1
he said : ' i refused to look			0
i thought i looked so ugly the first time i did , my stomach dropped			0
the vain man in me would have likened me to @entity224 - my hero - but i just looked so different			0
' ' i went back for the prognosis , it was the first time i ’d seen the surgeon smile			0
he said it was good news and that i had the all clear			0
it was such a big relief , i just felt brilliant ' , he added			0
up until four weeks ago mr @entity2 wore a triangular - shaped plaster on his face in a bid to improve his appearance - but he added : ' teenagers would actually shout abuse across the street , they would be laughing and pointing at me			1
' adults would avoid me - when they saw me they ’d hurry their kids across the road			0
some people thought i ’d been in a terrible fight and had brought it on myself			0
i felt ignored and was sick of people patronising me			0
' but it did n’t stop me going out , my amazing wife helped me and told me i was better than them - i would n’t let them stop me getting on with his life			1
' family support : @entity2 and @entity254 on their wedding day , 1971			1
he said his ' amazing wife ' helped him dealing with his treatment surgeons operated to improve the appearance of @entity2 ’s top lip last september and he was finally fitted with a silicon nose produced by @entity264 @entity263 last month			1
technicians at the firm spent months designing and producing the prosthetic nose , which was a rare task for them , as they were used to creating eyes , nipples and ears			1
' they looked at photos to create an exact replica of my nose and matched my skin colour perfectly			2
it is so life - like , the detail is incredible - there are even varicose veins			0
' mr @entity2 had waited more than three years for his new nose , which is held on with magnets			1
' i burst into tears when i saw it for the first time - it looked so real ' , he said			0
within the last months , his self - confidence has shot up and he is delighted			0
' when i walked out of the hospital with my new nose , not one person looked at me			2
although i ’ll never look the same , i am so pleased i can get on with my life ' , he said .			0
