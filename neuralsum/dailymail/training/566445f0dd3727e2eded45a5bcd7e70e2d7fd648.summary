it is a town which has struggled with its image for many years			2
previous ' awards ' for @entity3 include being voted the ' dirtiest town in @entity5 ' and the ' worst place to live in the @entity5 '			1
and if these pictures are anything to go by , it looks like the town is still struggling to shake off its poor reputation			2
concerned with @entity3 's image , a local photographer , who did not want to be named , wandered the streets of the @entity17 town and took this disturbing series of images			1
feeding time : a group of rats pictured near @entity3 town centre in @entity24 unattractive : @entity3 has previously been voted as one of the worst places to live in the @entity5 destruction : broken glass scattered on the ground after a car window was smashed following a break - in break - in : a car window after being broken into by thieves with large groups of rats pictured eating on discarded food , cars left with shattered windows following break - ins by thieves and litter left lying on the streets , it paints a grim picture of the town			1
but it seems his concerns about the town may well fall on deaf ears			2
@entity52 , the leader of the @entity54 group on @entity55 , defended the town and said it does not have a problem with street cleaning and refuse collection			1
' yes , the town has got problems but i can not agree that it is a dirty mess , ' he said			0
' i can not agree with that at all			0
what a mess : bags of overflowing rubbish discarded in the @entity70 area of @entity3 wrong award : @entity3 was voted the dirtiest town in the @entity5 in 2002 ' the government has made local government cuts and @entity3 , as with other places , has had to cope with that			1
' in terms of street cleaning , i have not noticed that it has gone downhill			1
parts of the town are run down but that is not really a fault of the council			0
it is doing its best under difficult circumstances			0
' i would not say that refuse collection and street cleaning has suffered in any way			1
with less staff they are still managing to keep the streets tidy			0
for years @entity3 has suffered with this bad image but i do not think it deserves it			0
' with all councils across the country facing cuts in central government grants , the images reflect the challenges faced by towns across @entity5 as they struggle not to slide into neglect			1
the concerns about rubbish in @entity3 follow the decision by the borough council to approve cuts to street cleaning services last year			1
@entity3 is best known for its airport , football club and carnival - the largest of its kind in @entity114			0
the town , which has a population of around 255,000 , has long been proud of its football team , which currently plays in the @entity118			0
its history includes a number of spells in the top flight of @entity124 football			0
in 1988 , @entity125 won the @entity126			1
international links : despite the concerns over rubbish , @entity3 has plenty going for it , including one of the largest airports in @entity124 @entity133 : the @entity134 is the largest one - day carnival in @entity114 one of the biggest employers in the town and a huge source of visitors is @entity140 , which opened in 1938 and is one of @entity124 's major airports			1
also based in the town is the @entity144 , attracting students to the area			0
one of the most popular events of the year in the town is the @entity134 which is held on the final may bank holiday			2
it is the largest one - day carnival in @entity114			0
@entity152 pickings : a pigeon feasting on food that has been thrown on the ground smashed : a disused factory that has been vandalised reflects how @entity3 is struggling to clean up its streets the cutbacks , which the council said would save £ 262,000 a year , resulted in the loss of 12 jobs from the council 's street cleaning team			1
the cuts also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of streets with an ' acceptable level of cleanliness ' , with a decline from 97 per cent to 87.5 per cent			2
cleaning was not reduced in the town centre and other busy shopping areas , but the response time of the graffiti removal service was increased to two days from one , except in cases of racially - motivated or offensive graffiti			1
speaking after the cuts decision last year , @entity180 group leader @entity179 criticised the decision			2
he said : ' the big issue is that they chopped £ 100,000 out of the budget last year and £ 34,000 the year before			0
' they clearly believe that this is not making any difference , but i ’m getting people saying to me that there is more litter , more fly posting			0
' are we going to go back to 2002 when @entity3 was voted the dirtiest town in @entity5 ? ' staff expressed concerns that blood spillages and graffiti would not be cleaned up at weekends during a consultation on the cuts			1
borough council spokesman @entity201 today defended its record for cleaning			0
he said : ' we believe the recent demolition of a multi-storey car park disturbed some rats but there is no evidence to suggest the population is any greater in @entity3 than in other towns and cities across the country			2
' the number of reports of rats and requests for treatment received by the council has actually fallen by around 30 per cent from 886 in 2008/9 to 618 in 2011/12			0
' we put this down to proactive baiting , integrated pest management ( treating an area rather than individual properties ) and working with home owners and landlords to educate about pest proofing measures			0
' it should be noted that the council ’s standards of street cleansing have improved in each of the last seven years and last year 98 per cent of streets were rated good or satisfactory , placing our borough in the top ten per cent in the @entity5			1
' we are also ranked in the top 30 per cent of councils nationwide for taking action against illegal fly - tipping , and the number of incidents has decreased steeply over the last two years - from 3,394 in 2011/12 to 2,134 so far this year			2
' @entity3 council continues to provide an in - house pest control team that carries out proactive and covert baiting in areas that rats are attracted to in the town centre			1
' we also provide a free service to home owners in the borough experiencing any public health pest problem which means they can get a rat problem dealt with at no expense to themselves and helps keep vermin levels to a minimum			0
' decline : the cuts also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of streets with an ' acceptable level of cleanliness ' , with a decline from 97 per cent to 87.5 per cent councillors criticised the cutbacks , saying that they feared the standard of cleanliness will slip further			2
