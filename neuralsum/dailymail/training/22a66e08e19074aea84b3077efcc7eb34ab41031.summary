by @entity0 it has been nine days since the @entity3 jet was shot down over a remote war - torn corner of eastern @entity6			1
but as world leaders prevaricate over their response to an act of mass murder , the disgraceful failure to recover all 298 victims of flight @entity9 was all too evident yesterday			1
three generations of one @entity6 family could be seen picking their way through the wreckage like people inspecting the aftermath of a storm			1
it is one of many to have been rifled through at the crash site since the plane came down on july 17 many bodies are still lost in the fields of sunflowers that surround the area – and could remain until the 5ft high crops are harvested next month			1
but it is the inescapable stench of rotting flesh in 30c heat that is so distressing – at a site controlled by the same heavily armed @entity45 rebels accused of destroying the @entity46 with a missile			1
it can only be guessed what the families of those who lost their lives on the flight from @entity53 to @entity54 must make of it all			0
although the repatriation flights have begun , just 200 bodies and an unspecified number of body parts have so far been sent to the @entity61 for identification			1
almost a third of the 298 killed – who included ten @entity65 – could still be missing and may never be found			1
the band of inexperienced kalashnikov - wielding recruits in charge in this corner of @entity6 has refused access to international forensic experts			1
as a result , the crash scene – which stretches for miles across the farming villages of @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 – remains in a state of ugly chaos			1
59908 143802 60651 71425 29443 distressing : one woman breaks down in tears as she looks at the debris from @entity9 which landed in a field of sunflowers in @entity85 , eastern @entity6 painstaking : @entity87 experts check debris at the main crash site of the @entity91 flight which came down in a remote war - torn corner of @entity6 assessment : forensic experts have spent days at the crash site , near the village of @entity75 , to carry out investigations and attempt to locate the plane 's black boxes persistent looting means vital evidence – and sentimental keepsakes – have been lost			1
parts of the plane have been stolen to be sold as scrap			1
giant pieces of fuselage are strewn for miles , along with twisted burnt metal , suitcases and clothing			0
parts of the doomed jet ’s cockpit lie surrounded by personal possessions that have clearly been tampered with or stolen from			0
wallets – emptied of cash – lie next to children ’s shoes and toys			0
a baby ’s bottle rests by a pile of opened letters			0
nearby , a collection of classical music is scattered across the charred ground			2
also still visible are the remains of animals and birds from the jet ’s hold , including pigeons , two dogs , peacocks and parrots			0
some locals have begun to light candles around the debris and to lay teddy bears in memory of the 80 children who died			0
retired miner @entity144 , 57 , who lives yards from the crashed cockpit , said many bodies are still hidden in the sunflowers as temperatures soar			2
tragic : a toy teddy bear placed at the crash site of @entity153 17 , near the village of @entity155 , eastern @entity6 , shows a mark of respect to the victims wreckage : the @entity3 flight was carrying 298 passengers when it came down over eastern @entity6 on july 17 tragic : one resident surveys the damage of @entity9 which was travelling from @entity53 to @entity54 when it came down over eastern @entity6 , killing all on board the father of two , one of 200 volunteers told by the rebels to search for bodies , said : ‘ you can smell them everywhere			1
there are also wild dogs here			0
the bodies will not last much longer			2
we need international forces to help search the site properly before it is too late			2
‘ the bodies are in the fields but you can not see them for the sunflowers			2
we do not harvest until the end of august so unless someone comes to help , they will not be uncovered until then			0
’ tears streaming down his face , mr @entity144 added : ‘ i saw many dead children here by my house			0
i bring flowers and light candles as respect for them			0
’ grieving relatives have told of how credit cards and mobile phones belonging to victims have been used since the crash			2
the @entity199 yesterday said it will work with relatives to help protect against fraud			0
respect : funeral hearses carrying the first 40 victims of @entity9 arrived at the @entity207 van @entity205 barracks in @entity208 , @entity61 on thursday tributes : hundreds of flowers and tributes were laid n @entity212 , @entity61 , as several of the bodies of the @entity9 victims were transported back to the country the crash investigation is being led by a @entity61 team as 194 of those killed were from the @entity61			1
yesterday , a small group was able to visit part of the scene , while a group of 40 @entity61 policemen are reported to be on their way to try to help secure the area			2
some 90 @entity227 military police are on standby in @entity228			0
@entity227 prime minister @entity229 fears some remains will never be recovered unless security is tightened			0
@entity233 ambassador to the @entity6 @entity234 said the crash site is ‘ a giant crime scene and needs to be treated that way			1
’ ‘ further destruction of the wreckage must be stopped			2
it ’s tragic that the site has still not fully been secured , ’ he added .			0
