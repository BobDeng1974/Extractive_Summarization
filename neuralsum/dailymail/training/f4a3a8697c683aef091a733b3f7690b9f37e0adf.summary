by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 11:07 est , 12 november 2012 more than one million motorists from around the world have exchanged their foreign licences for a @entity6 one in the last 15 years , it emerged today			1
according the figures obtained under the @entity10 , the number of licences exchanged per year peaked at 96,935 in 2007 , before falling to 79,187 in 2009			2
over the past three years , the number has risen steadily once again , reaching 83,553 in 2011			2
currently , the @entity6 recognises the driving licences awarded to drivers by 50 other countries , meaning they can be exchanged after 12 months of residency for a @entity6 licence without the holder needing to pass any @entity6 test			1
drivers from 50 countries can exchange their licence for a @entity6 one after 12 months without taking a test almost half of the licences swapped since 1997 have been gained in a country where the driving test does n't include driving on the left			1
@entity29 , chief claims officer at @entity30 which uncovered the figures , said : ' these figures reflect @entity6 's multi-cultural society demonstrating that we are welcoming an increasing number of motorists to our shores who are choosing to live and drive here			2
' however , @entity6 roads are very different to those overseas so it 's vital that new motorists learn as much as they can , which could include taking a few lessons from an instructor if necessary			0
' since 1997 , drivers from @entity47 and @entity48 accounted for the highest number of licences exchanged with 149,897 and 103,053 respectively			1
however , as more countries entered the @entity52 in 2004 , allowing licences to be exchanged from eastern @entity55 countries , @entity56 ( 135,079 – average of 8,442 per year ) , @entity58 ( 18,719 ) and @entity60 ( 21,714 ) motorists are actively exchanging their licences			1
about 88,000 @entity56 drivers exchanged their licence for a @entity6 version in the five years between 2004 and 2008			1
the data goes on to show that on average each year since 1997 , 2,334 drivers exchanged @entity68 licences for @entity6 one			2
figures also show 2,895 drivers exchanged @entity72 licences and 836 drivers exchanged @entity75 licences for full @entity6 permits			2
research carried out by the @entity78 earlier this year highlighted a scam where drivers obtained a @entity6 driving licence by exploiting the arrangement that the @entity6 has with @entity72 – which saw more than 6,000 exchanged every year for the past five years , even though the average is much lower			1
agreements also exist with some @entity47 countries			0
around 950 @entity87 licences were exchanged in 2011 , down from 1,282 in 2010 and a peak of 6,168 in 2002			0
nearly half of the licences exchanged since 1997 are from countries where the test does not require driving on the left hand lane the @entity6 's agreement with @entity95 was suspended in 2002 then later reinstated , resulting in 242 @entity95 licences being exchanged in the early part of 2012			1
@entity29 added : ' while the fact that the @entity6 recognises licences issued in certain countries shows that driving tests in those countries are likely to be of a high standard , it 's important to recognise that driving in the @entity6 is unique in many ways			0
' as such , it 's important for everyone planning to drive in the @entity6 to take the time to become familiar with @entity6 road signs and speed limits , as well as driver etiquette – exactly as @entity6 motorists should when driving abroad			0
' @entity113 , driving instructor at @entity115 - based @entity114 , commented : ' people who learned to drive abroad will often face difficulties driving in the @entity6			0
' the obvious differences include driving on a different side of the road and new signs and speed limits , but there are also more subtle differences such as etiquette on the road that seem obvious to us , but are extremely important			0
' i 've taught a range of drivers who have originally learned to drive outside the @entity6 , some of whom have settled in with no problems and others who 've needed a little help			0
' it 's a good idea for anyone new to @entity6 roads to take a short lesson or two with an approved driving instructor in order to be on the safe side			0

around *80,000* licences exchanged in 2011 alone , three times the amount exchanged 15 years *ago*
@entity47 , @entity56 and @entity48 drivers account for highest number of licence exchanges since 1997
@entity6 licence exchanging has almost *doubled* in past ten years – up *37,057* since 2001
