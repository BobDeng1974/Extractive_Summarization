by @entity0 published : 09:02 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 12:18 est , 30 october 2012 an abused dog has been found wandering the streets in @entity3 with a coffee can around its neck			2
the bottom and the top circular portions of the coffee can had been removed and the remaining tube had been placed over the head and around the neck of the starving dog			0
when a @entity14 found the emaciated dog , it became clear that the coffee can had been on it ’s neck for a sizeable amount of time because her skin had grown around the edges of the can			1
pitiful : the starving dog may not have eaten for weeks , say rescuers cruel : the dog was unable to eat because the edges of the can gouged into her neck care : the can is painstakingly cut away from @entity29 's neck by @entity30 of @entity31 ‘ her body had tried to grow over the can , ’ a spokesman from the @entity30 of @entity31 told the @entity33			1
rescuers jokingly nicknamed the @entity38 , and took it to @entity39 along with another stray dog named @entity41			2
every one of severely emaciated @entity29 ' ribs was visible , as the edges of the can cut into the dog ’s neck , preventing her from eating for days or weeks			1
one of the worse injuries was to one of @entity29 ’s ears , which was nearly severed by the sharp edge of the rusting can			2
raw : @entity29 's skin was severely lacerated by the rusty , jagged edges of the can bloodied : the coffee can after removal from @entity29 's head			1
the dog is now recovering from its ordeal after the veterinarians cut the can off @entity29 ’s neck , the dog was taken to @entity65			0
‘ the next few days are critical , ’ a @entity65 representative posted on their @entity68 page , where they posted pictures of the injured dog			0
‘ we have to get her stable enough for surgery and watch out for organ failure due to her starved condition			0
but that tail is wagging			0

the dog , named @entity29 by rescuers , was found *trapped* in a coffee can
it *stopped* the starved *animal* eating for days or even weeks
@entity29 's skin was ' growing around ' the sharp edges of the can
