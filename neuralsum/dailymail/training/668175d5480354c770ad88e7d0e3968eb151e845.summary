refusal : a teacher who ignored @entity4 authorities ' orders to evict her parents has been forced to divorce her husband and lost her job ( file photo ) ms @entity8 , who is a teacher at the @entity19 in @entity21 province , said that when she was first handed the edict she thought they wanted her to persuade her parents to leave their home			1
but it soon became apparent they wanted her and her husband to demolish it			0
' i feel this is too ridiculous			1
if i had only been asked to perform ideological work on my parents i would have done , but asking me to demolish it with my own hands is simply incredible			1
i ca n't do it			0
i am supposed to be a model for others			0
i would be cursed to death by students and how could i teach in the future , ' she said			0
it is still not clear why the land is needed - land seizures rank as among the biggest causes of social tension in @entity4 , spotlighting an ugly side of the urbanization drive that has raised it to the world 's second - biggest economy			1
ms @entity8 ignored the local @entity51 request during the summer , but was shocked to be told by the headmaster when she returned in september that she had been suspended and would not be allowed to teach until her parents ' home was demolished			1
although she had not broken any rules , the decision had been taken according to a document signed by local officials			2
ms @entity8 's husband is also a teacher at the school and to make sure he was not embroiled in the messy sage she took the difficult decision of divorcing him last month			1
the pair live apart and take the childcare in looking after their toddler separately			0
last month it emerged that when another woman called @entity70 's home was razed three years ago , she went to @entity4 's capital @entity72 to complain about the city and county governments that ordered the demolition			0
land disputes are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests across @entity4 each year since then , she says family members have been kidnapped at least 18 times , typically having black bags thrust over their heads before being taken to a hotel - turned - illegal jail in the eastern city of @entity88 and locked for weeks in a tiny , windowless room			2
@entity70 's story is shocking even in a country that has become used to tales of arbitrary and sometimes violent land expropriations			0
it illustrates how the stresses from the deep indebtedness of @entity4 's local governments extend beyond banks into the lives of ordinary @entity4 , as hard - up authorities resort to any means they can in a desperate scramble for funds			2
' our @entity88 is now steep in debt , ' said @entity70			0
' the @entity88 today relies on drawing from residents ' financial wealth and stealing residents ' land to survive			0
' her 74 - year - old mother , she says , has been abducted nearly a dozen times and held illegally for almost a year in a campaign to silence the family 's demands for proper compensation			2
@entity117 said in a report last year that land grabs have increased as the economy slows and local governments have sought cash to pay off debt , though other experts dispute the finding			1
there is no official data on land grabs			0
according to reports , local authorities across @entity4 derive between 20 and 90 percent of their income from selling expropriated land			2
land disputes are one of the main causes of the tens of thousands of protests across @entity4 each year			0
most go unreported , although some , like a revolt in the southern village of @entity139 in 2011 , have attracted a high profile and prompted promises of action by @entity72			0
last month a four - year - old girl was killed by a bulldozer that was razing her home during a land grab in the southeastern province of @entity21 , local media reported .			1
