@entity0 has announced a £ 4 million increase in profits over the past 12 months due to its popularity the were once the preserve of middle - class housewives across rural @entity5			1
but the @entity0 - the quintessentially @entity5 oven - has become a sought - after status symbol among @entity9 ’s burgeoning middle - classes			1
as their maker , @entity12 , prepares to sell its first cookers in @entity9 this autumn , analysts said they had become akin to owning ‘ a @entity14 or a @entity15 ’ in the far - east			2
it comes as the firm , which was badly - affected by the financial crisis , announced sales were up 3.3 per cent for the first half of the year , with a 10 per cent rise in the @entity5			1
the cast - iron cooker maker recorded revenues of £ 124million this year , compared to £ 120million in 2013			1
@entity24 , an investment research analyst at @entity26 , said : ‘ there are more and more middle - class consumers in @entity9 and , just like they want bmws and @entity15 , they are also looking for other prestigious consumer items – and the @entity0 is one of them			1
’ the @entity0 for the @entity9 market will include a hob on the top which can be used to cook food in a wok			2
a spokeswoman for the firm said : ‘ we noticed that cooking trends in @entity9 were really changing			0
‘ it used to be that most cooking was traditionally done in a wok , but baking is now becoming more and more popular over there			0
‘ the radiant heat you get from an @entity0 rather than a fan oven gives a more even result when baking and the consumers have responded to that			2
’ currently , @entity9 customers must order the cooker from @entity0 in the @entity5 or from a number of other overseas suppliers			1

’ the company still reported a loss of £ 300,000 during the first half of the year , although this was an improvement on £ 2.4million in 2013			0
