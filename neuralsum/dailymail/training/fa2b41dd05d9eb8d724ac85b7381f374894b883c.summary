by @entity0 smartphones and computers are having to process more information than ever before , but the outdated materials they are made of are not equipped to handle such a steep rise in demand			0
now , scientists have found a way to speed up how fast all this information can be processed by developing a new , future - proof class of materials			1
and they have discovered a quantum effect that enables electrons to dash through the interior of these materials with very little resistance			2
scientists from @entity19 have developed a new material , called topological @entity22 semi-metal			1
its structure means electrons pass through its interior , rather than just along its surface , and this paves the way for electronics , such as phones and tablets , to process information much faster			1
illustration pictured the base material is known as a ‘ topological insulator , ’ in which electrons move along the surface without penetrating the interior			1
this latest research , from @entity19 , found electrons also can flow through the interior of some of these materials			1
these new materials have been called ‘ topological @entity22 semi-metals ’ , after @entity46 quantum physicist and 1933 @entity48 winner @entity22 , who was the first to note electrons could behave like light			1
‘ with this discovery , instead of facing the challenge of how to use only the electrons on the surface of a material , now you can just cut the material open and you have light - like electrons flowing in three dimensions inside the materials , ’ said lead researcher @entity52 , a professor of physics at @entity19			1
in most materials , including copper and other metals that conduct electricity , electrons navigate an obstacle course of microscopic outcroppings , ledges and other imperfections that obstruct the particles and send them scattering in the wrong directions			2
this causes resistance and the conversion of electrical current into heat , which is why electronic appliances become warm during use			0
in topological insulators , and the new class of materials the @entity19 researchers studied , the unique properties of the atoms combine to create quantum effects that coax electrons into acting similar to a light wave , instead of like individual particles			1
these properties were theoretically proposed by @entity93 and a team at the @entity95 in 2005			0
in 2011 , the dr @entity52 detected this fast electron - flow in the interior of a material made from combining several elements - bismuth , pictured , thallium , sulfur and selenium these waves can weave , dodge and even move through barriers that would typically stop most electrons			2
these properties were theoretically proposed by @entity93 and a team at the @entity95 from 2005 to 2007 , but was n't observed experimentally in solid materials until 2007			0
in 2011 , dr @entity110 detected this fast electron - flow in the interior of a material made from combining several elements - bismuth , thallium , sulfur and selenium			0
the term topological insulator is now quite well known , but the term insulator means there are no electrons flowing in the bulk of the material			0
this new study shows that electrons are flowing in the bulk of the material , meaning cadmium arsenide is not an insulator but is still topological in nature , making it a completely new type of quantum matter			2
the research was conducted by an international team of scientists from the @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 and published in two papers in the journal @entity143			0
the materials were named after @entity46 quantum physicist and 1933 @entity48 winner @entity22 , pictured , who noted electrons could behave like light this team demonstrated fast electrons can flow through crystals made from cadmium and arsenic , or cadmium arsenide , as well as elements bismuth and selenium			1
during tests into cadmium arsenide , in particular , the electrons had an average velocity that was 10,000 times more than that of the previous bismuth - based materials identified by the group			1
‘ this is a big deal , ’ dr @entity52 said			0
‘ it means the electrons can flow quite easily in the material and many more exotic quantum effects can now be studied			2
' that just was n't possible in the past			0
’ these materials would be ideal for electronics that do calculations and transmit information			1
the speeds achieved by these electrons have led to comparisons to another novel electronic material - graphene			0
the semi-metals have the potential to be superior to graphene in some aspects , dr @entity52 said , because graphene is a single layer of atoms in which electrons can flow only in two dimensions			0
cadmium arsenide permits electrons to flow in three dimensions , for example .			0

scientists at @entity19 have developed a new class of materials
previous research found electrons move along the surface of materials known as ' topological insulators '
this latest class of materials also lets electrons move through its interior
the materials have been called ‘ topological @entity22 semi-metals ’ , after @entity46 quantum physicist and 1933 @entity48 winner @entity22
during tests , electrons travelled 10,000 times faster than in other materials
these materials are ideal for electronics that do calculations and send data
