pedestrians spotted this traffic warden in @entity2 , @entity3 , parking in double yellow lines before issuing tickets to other drivers traffic wardens are known as sticklers for rules , ready to punish motorists for the slightest violation			1
however , one warden in @entity2 , @entity3 , has provoked outrage after parking on a double yellow line before walking off to issue tickets to other drivers			1
despite being challenged by pedestrians over his behaviour , the @entity18 employee then climbed back into his unmarked car and drove off			2
witnesses say the man pulled on to the double yellow lines at around at around 8.50am yesterday			1
he spent the next 15 minutes waking around nearby streets , and handed out at least one parking ticket			2
@entity27 , 31 , was walking to work at the time and asked the traffic warden why he was parked on double yellow lines			1
he said : ' i had to say something , but he seemed pretty unrepentant			0
' he said " you would n’t be saying this if i was a police officer parked on double yellow lines "			1
' i told him that if they were n’t attending an emergency call then i definitely would be unhappy and besides he is n’t a police officer			0
' but he just said he was doing his job and got in the car and drove off			0
' what gives him the right to park illegally when everybody else gets punished by him for doing the same ? it ’s not on			0
' pedestrians @entity46 and @entity47 , who were walking their dog at the time , said they could not believe their eyes			0
@entity46 , 60 , said : ' we watched this car pull up on double yellow lines			2
' i went over to warn him to watch out as there ’s lots of traffic wardens around here and then low and behold a traffic warden popped out			1
' he issued a ticket to at least one other car as far as i could see , i do n’t think it is right at all			0
' @entity47 , 58 , added : ' it ’s just pure hypocrisy			0
i could n’t believe my eyes			0
' i know they have a job to do but surely they should work within the law themselves because it does not send out a good message at all			0
' a @entity18 spokesperson said : ' @entity91 are exempt from most parking restrictions while carrying out their duties			2
' parking on double yellow lines is included in this exemption			1
while officers will always seek alternative parking this is not always practicably possible			2
' however a council spokesman confirmed wardens are exempt from most parking rules while on duty , and that parking on a double yellow is included			1
