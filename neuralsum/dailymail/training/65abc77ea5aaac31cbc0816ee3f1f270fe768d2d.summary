wildlife rangers believe that the creatures could have eaten toxic substances laid to keep away ' pests ' from the highly lucrative crop			1
the animals live on land in the @entity13 which is very close to palm oil fields			1
thriving : the orphan pygmy elephant is being cared for at a wildlife reserve where it was taken after the death of its mother a total of 14 pygmy elephants are now know to have died			1
four adults were discovered yesterday in addition to ten bodies found earlier in the week			1
vets said that all the dead elephants had suffered severe bleeding and gastrointestinal ulcers , suggesting they had been poisoned			1
among the survivors is a three - month - old calf which was pictured pitifully trying to rouse his mother after she dropped down dead			0
it is now being cared for at a wildlife park in @entity35 where rangers have found it a home with other orphans			0
wildlife workers fear that more elephants could have been poisoned and are lying undiscovered in the remoter parts of @entity5			1
@entity42 , @entity35 ’s director of wildlife , said : ‘ we are very concerned that many more carcasses are going to turn up			0
' because the elephants travel in herds they are going to be picking up the poisons together so we fear that there are still more dead that are going to be found			2
’ ' great loss ' : a three - month - old elephant calf attempts to wake its mother ; one of ten pygmy elephants found dead in @entity57 's @entity35 state attached : the baby elephant sticks close to the body of its mother , while a wildlife department official gives it a drink he said that rangers were scouring the island for areas where poison could have been laid			1
‘ my hunch is that there may be more ( carcasses )			0
i do n’t think it ’s an accident , ' he added , explaining that the area where the dead elephants were found is part of a 100,000 - acre ( 40,469 - hectare ) piece of ' commercial forest reserve ' land managed by state agency @entity76			2
he said the area was slated to be used as a tree plantation for sustainable logging			0
so far , two palm oil plantations and a logging company operate in the area , he said			0
mr @entity42 said far too many jungle areas in @entity35 were being broken up by agricultural or logging activities , without corridors linking them to allow animals to pass through			2
' this should n't be			0
the fragmentation of forests has disrupted the elephants ' traditional routes to look for food			2
' it is highly suspected that the poisoning is blatantly done or that it 's a well - planned programme			0
' police are investigating the deaths and officials have declined to say whether there are any suspects			2
meanwhile , conservationists say they are deeply concerned about the effects the palm oil industry is having on the wildlife of @entity5			1
a spokesman for the @entity106 said that the dead elephants were found in areas being converted for plantations , giving fresh urgency to activists ' warnings of rising conflict between man and wildlife as development accelerates			2
' the central forest landscape in @entity35 needs to be protected totally from conversion , ' the group said in a statement			0
' conversions result in fragmentation of the forests , which in turn results in loss of natural habitat for elephant herds , thus forcing them to find alternative food and space , putting humans and wildlife wildlife in direct conflict			0
' suspicious : conservation officials believe the elephants , discovered in the @entity13 , had been poisoned ' sad day ' : a total of seven female and three male pygmy elephants have been found in the forest over the past three weeks the first ten known deaths of the pygmy elephants were made public this week , capturing wide attention as only about 1,200 of the elephants exist worldwide			1
authorities released several photographs of the elephant carcasses , including a particularly poignant one of the three - month - old surviving calf trying to wake its dead mother			0
most of the pygmy elephants live in @entity35 and grow to about 8 feet ( 245 centimetres ) tall , a foot or two shorter than mainland asian elephants			1
known for their babyish faces , large ears and long tails , @entity5 pygmy elephants were found to be a distinct subspecies only in 2003 , after dna testing			1
@entity35 is one of the poorest states in @entity57			0
@entity76 was granted huge forest concessions , totaling about 14 percent of total land area in @entity35 , by the state government to enable it to generate income to fund its aim of improving the lives of poor rural people			0
the @entity76 website said it had adopted sound forest management policies to ensure the areas are managed on a sustainable basis			0
tragic : the carcasses of the endangered animals were found in the forest over a period of three weeks			1

a total of ten of the creatures have been discovered in the @entity13 , @entity5 , over the past three weeks
conservation officials believe the endangered animals had been poisoned
*estimated* to be fewer than 1,500 @entity5 pygmy elephants in existence
