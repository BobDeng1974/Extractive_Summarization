by @entity0 eliminated three times by @entity3 in past @entity4 , @entity1 vowed a fearless and fighting approach on the eve of saturday 's second round knockout game against the hosts and favourites			1
despite the combative talk , ' @entity1 ' are sweating on the fitness of two key players - midfielders @entity13 , known as ' @entity14 ' , and @entity15 , nicknamed ' @entity16 ' - for the showdown at @entity20 's @entity19 stadium			1
@entity3 , who will again be screamed on by legions of fans expecting nothing less than a sixth @entity25 , knocked out @entity1 with relative ease at the same stage in their last two appearances , 2010 and 1998			1
fitness race : both @entity15 ( left ) and @entity13 ( right ) are doubts for @entity1 as they prepare to take on @entity3 man with a plan : @entity35 is inspired by a chance to beat @entity3 in front of their own fans they also broke @entity42 hearts in 1962 , beating them in the semi-finals when ' @entity1 ' were hosting the tournament			1
' it 's not by chance that @entity3 won those matches			1
they 've won the @entity25 five times			2
statistically , they 're the best team in the world , ' @entity1 coach @entity35 told reporters			1
' but we have a chance to change history			2
we will play with courage as we did in the qualifiers and the group			2
if we do n't fight against a team that has the whole stadium , the whole nation behind them , then the result will be quite clear			2
' @entity1 's 2 - 0 defeat of reigning champions @entity66 sent shockwaves round the world and confirmed the strength of the @entity71 ' aggressive and pacy team			1
' @entity1 have improved a lot , we have developed a lot , nowadays we can play without fear			1
@entity1 will play to win			1
we do n't want to be forgotten			0
@entity3 already have a beautiful history , we want to make a history of our own , ' he said			1
ready : @entity79 's @entity78 will shine in a @entity1 shirt because he is appreciated says @entity35 the @entity82 coach admitted @entity13 would not have played if the match had been on friday due to a muscle injury in his left leg , but held out hope the defender might recover in time for saturday 's lunchtime kickoff			1
' today he would n't play , tomorrow maybe			0
let 's see if the next 24 hours allow him to play			0
like @entity15 , he 's not 100 percent , ' @entity35 said			0
@entity15 is still suffering the effects of recent knee surgery			0
one of the few advantages @entity1 have is that their training base is just a few miles from the @entity19 stadium , so although the atmosphere will be hostile on saturday , the city at least has felt like home over the last two weeks			2
@entity1 do not plan to man - mark @entity101 , but will seek to suffocate @entity3 's leading man at every turn , the coach said			1
at the other end , they are relying on @entity79 forward @entity78 to do the damage			0
@entity35 said it was no wonder he played better for @entity1 than he did for the @entity110 club			2
third time lucky : @entity1 have been knocked out by @entity3 in both of their last two @entity4 appearances ' @entity78 feels very comfortable with the national team			1
he knows that he 's highly appreciated by his colleagues			0
' so that 's why he 's playing so well			0
in his club , maybe his team mates do n't appreciate him so much , ' he said			0
' i think he 's got enough assets to be one of the best players in the world			0
' defender @entity121 echoed his boss 's confidence , saying @entity1 's performances in beating both @entity1 and @entity125 at the group stage had won them respect around the world			2
' it 's the most important match in my career			0
it 's a beautiful opportunity for us to change history for our national team			0
our team is very motivated			0
we 're convinced we can win			0
