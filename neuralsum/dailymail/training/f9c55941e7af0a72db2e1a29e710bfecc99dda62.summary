by @entity0 the public sector has labelled treasurer @entity3 's first federal budget a ' wrecking ball ' after he announced 16,500 public servants will lose their jobs over the next four years			1
mr @entity3 says the job losses , which are 4500 more than the coalition promised would be cut at the 2013 federal election , will make the bureaucracy more efficient and accountable			2
the job cuts are only 2000 more than the 14,500 bequeathed by the previous @entity13 government			0
national broadcasters @entity21 and @entity22 will also take a hit , losing $ 43.5 million in funding over four years			1
the coalition at the election promised not to cut funding to two broadcasters			1
but the 2014/15 budget includes a one per cent cut in their base funding , described as a ' down payment ' on an efficiency study completed earlier this year			2
@entity34 national secretary @entity33 said the 16,500 figure does n't include the ' many further job losses ' that will flow from the government 's program of privatisation and outsourcing			1
the @entity21 will lose $ 35.5 million in funding , a move the @entity34 says ' will do enormous damage to our public broadcaster ' ' not one single job loss that will come from those [ privatisation or outsourcing ] efforts is counted in this budget , ' ms @entity33 said			1
' we could see tens of thousands of jobs go over these next few years			1
'' @entity52 's @entity51 is a wrecking ball that smashes jobs and services ... it 's a myth you can cut this many jobs and not affect services			0
' ms @entity33 was critical of the cuts to the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity18 and the announcement that the @entity60 would lose $ 111.4 million over the next four years			1
' ripping $ 35.5 million out of the @entity21 , closing the @entity61 and cutting $ 8 million from @entity22 will do enormous damage to our public broadcasters , ' she said			1
the @entity18 will carry the largest staff reduction , with 4700 jobs to go in the next four years ' cutting 2300 tax workers is not going to help us collect the revenue @entity70 needs for essential services			1
' cutting 500 @entity60 staff will not help us come up with world - class innovations we need for globally competitive industries			2
' and cutting civilian staff in @entity76 simply means taking soldiers out of the frontline and putting them behind desks			0
' ms @entity33 also said the assertion the previous @entity13 government had bequeathed 14,500 job cuts was ' a myth '			0
' worst year of @entity13 cuts was 2,500 jobs			0
now we 're facing triple that number , ' she said			0
six - hundred public service jobs in the defence department are set to go in the next financial year			1
in total , more than 2000 positions will be lost by 2017/18 through natural attrition and changes to recruitment practices			0
the @entity34 has labelled mr @entity3 's first federal budget a ' wrecking ball ' but defence will get an extra $ 800 million to make $ 29.2 billion in 2014/15 and will benefit from almost $ 33 billion in 2017/18 , the budget papers show			2
the public sector union had feared losses of more than 25,000 , saying 6000 announced before the budget had already stretched government services to breaking point			2
the @entity51 outlined the government 's plan to further shrink the number of assets owned by the federal , state and territory governments to achieve it			0
private health fund @entity112 has already been slated for a hoped - for $ 4 billion sale			0
the @entity22 will lose $ 8 million in funding among other assets the federal government said it was investigating selling were the @entity123 ; the registry services of the corporate regulator , the @entity120 , plus @entity121 and @entity70 hearing			1
' the government is transforming its role to be smaller and as efficient and well - targeted as possible , with some changes informed by the @entity129 's recommendations , ' it said in the budget papers			0
states and territories would be encouraged to sell assets and develop infrastructure too			0
they would receive 15 per cent of the price of an asset sold if the sale proceeds go to new infrastructure investment .			0

@entity18 will wear the most losses with 4700 jobs to go
funding for public broadcasters slashed by $ 43.5 million
@entity60 set to lose $ 111.4 million in funding over the next four years
@entity148 says more losses will flow from privatisation and outsourcing
