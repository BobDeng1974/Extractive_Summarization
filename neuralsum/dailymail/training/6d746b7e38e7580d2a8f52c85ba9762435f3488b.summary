@entity5 now has to be under constant supervision as she has dropped to a skeletal weight			2
doctors fear that the now - 19 - year - old may never recover , but her mother is holding out for a recovery , citing the fact that she is now off of her feeding tube as a good sign			1
while she may be remaining upbeat , her daughter has not come to terms with her inability to move her own limbs			2

' she sees that she can not walk , and when she realizes what happened to her , she cries			0
' @entity5 suffered brain damage in the hour after the breast augmentation finished but now the doctor who performed the surgery is filing to have access to her earlier medical records because he feels she hid key facts from him			1
she allegedly had a complication from anesthesia that she was given during the birth of her son , and if she had told the doctor about that incident he would have approached the procedure differently			1
serious : @entity5 was in a coma for two months after the august 2013 cosmetic surgery and still has not recovered fully as her doctors fear that she may have permanent brain and heart damage for months following the august 2013 operation , the then - 18 - year - old 's toddler son was not told about his mother 's illness			1

they also are in the process of gearing up for a court battle as they are planning on filing a lawsuit against the doctor who put in their daughter 's breast implants			2
while the medical explanation for what exactly happened is still being debated , it is visible that something terrible has happened to the girl because she is so thin			0
before the worst : @entity5 's parents described her as vivacious and spirited before the august 2013 surgery changed roles : now @entity5 's parents are considering filing to be considered the legal guardians of both their 19 - year - old daughter ( right ) and her now - 4 - year - old son ( left ) since she can no longer care for herself or the boy @entity5 had the breast augmentation surgery at the @entity93 in august 2013 after paying $ 2,800 , which is believed to be about half of the normal price of the procedure			1
her family were told that her heart stopped during the operation and she was ' effectively ' dead when she was transported to hospital			0
she suffered brain and heart damage during the procedure			0
@entity20 was admitted to @entity103 following her procedure and her family 's attorney , @entity105 , said that finding out what went wrong will require litigation			0
questions : her doctor now believes that she left critical information about her medical history out of their pre-operation consultations dr @entity115 , who performed the surgery , has a clean record and is a board certified plastic surgeon , according to the @entity120 @entity119			2
dr @entity121 is calling for an investigation into her medical history because he claims that the girl knew she had suffered complications when she gave birth to her son			2
' they put a spinal aesthetic , and she needed to be intubated , ' dr @entity121 said in a report filed by the medical center to gain access to her earlier records			0
he says that the information was purposefully kept from him in order to keep him from calling off the plastic surgery			0
she told the doctor during one of their consultations that she had a history of seizures eight years before the breast augmentation but had stopped taking medication as the seizures stopped and had no known history of lung or heart problems			1
she also said that she had stopped smoking			0

false advertising : the clinic is not in @entity182 as the name would suggest but is above a pet grooming salon in @entity185 video @entity186			0
