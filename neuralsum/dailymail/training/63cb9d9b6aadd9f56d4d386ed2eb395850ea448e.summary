@entity7 , who broke down in tears as she gave her concession speech , had earlier called @entity11 @entity10 to congratulate him on his landslide victory			1

lost in the noise of tuesday 's @entity61 elections is a second potential landslide , with republicans threatening to reassert their dominance over governor 's mansions in a large majority of states			1
the marquee matchup in @entity25 pitted @entity70 , the paraplegic state attorney general , against state sen. @entity0 , a freshly minted feminist icon known for filibustering an anti-abortion bill in pink sneakers			1
@entity70 had pulled away in recent days , enlarging a 6 - point lead to an 18 - point spread in the last two weeks – since @entity7 ran a controversial tv ad making a wheelchair the center of attention - and ended up winning big on tuesday , despite reports that he failed to even make the ballot in one town			1
@entity83 farewell : @entity7 told her supporters it was ok to be disappointed , but they should never be discouraged winner : @entity25 attorney general and @entity11 governor - elect @entity70 ( above ) waves to the crowd before his victory speech in @entity92 accusations surfaced tuesday afternoon that in the @entity25 's third-most populous county , @entity70 's name is n't on at least one touch - screen ballot machine			1
instead , an @entity99 photo of a @entity101 machine shows , the @entity11 slot is taken by @entity102 , the 2012 failed @entity11 candidate for lieutenant governor			0
@entity104 , communications director at the conservative @entity106 organization , told @entity107 that his group had confirmed @entity101 has received ' additional complaints ' and that ' they are currently investigating how widespread the matter is			0
' ' unlike voting machine calibration issues that may switch votes , ' he explained , ' this appears to be a data - entry error when preparing the digital ballots			0
' ' i think it 's a photoshopped deal but we are checking , ' @entity101 elections administrator @entity117 told the @entity121			2
the image , which shows clunky block - like sections of the video template out of place , could reflect a ham - fisted @entity127 attempt , a @entity11 campaign consultant in @entity129 told @entity107			1
' or , ' he said , ' it could be that the voting machine 's software is messed up			0
if it 's pulling in candidates from two years ago , who knows what else is wrong in those computers ? ' the campaign operative insisted , though , that @entity70 would win tuesday			1
@entity7 ( left ) comforts her mother @entity140 ( right ) after her loss on tuesday celebration : @entity10 embraced his daughter @entity143 ( above ) following his win an alert @entity101 , @entity25 voter snapped this picture of a voting machine that omitted the name of @entity11 gubernatorial candidate @entity70 , substituting 2012 failed lieutenant governor hopeful @entity102 instead ' not even the @entity150 could buy enough votes or stuff enough ballot boxes to save @entity0 at this point , ' he said			1

' i do n't have time for that , ' the woman told her			0
@entity154 posted a second photo on @entity169 , showing the same kind of digital goof			0
it 's also unclear how many votes for @entity102 were recorded before the machine was taken out of service			0
election officials said there 's not much they can do about it , and @entity25 election law prohibits them from assigning his votes to @entity10			1
far less @entity183 controversy chased candidates in @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and other states – 36 in all – that are choosing chief executives on tuesday			2
about 14 of those races are rated as toss - ups			0
in 14 states overall , democrats appear to be safely in control either because the races are runaways or because they 're not contested this year			0
that number pales next to the 22 states that @entity11 can easily count on running when the rust settles			0
sending him packing ? @entity187 democrat @entity201 failed to end the rule of gov. @entity203 , even though she got some help from pres. @entity205 gov. @entity203 has attracted scorn and tens of millions of dollars in attack ads from angry labor unions , but still could not be stopped a second photo of the @entity101 , @entity25 machine showed a vote cast for @entity102 , who isn ? t running for office this year big surrogate : @entity217 gov. @entity216 ( front ) stumped last week for @entity185 @entity11 gubernatorial hopeful @entity219 in a race that 's now too close to call by a hair 's @entity222 ? @entity223 ( right ) is @entity185 's lieutenant governor , and @entity205 wanted him to get the top job in @entity187 , organized labor arch - enemy @entity203 's lead was within the polling margin of error against @entity48 @entity201 , but he still pulled of a rather large victory in the state			1
@entity230 has campaigned there for @entity232 personally , making her one of few politicians who welcomed the unpopular president 's help			2
@entity203 is loathed on the political left for trimming the sails of the state 's powerful unions , but he survived a nasty recall effort and has presided over an economic program that added jobs , cut deficits and grew the state economy dramatically			2
@entity185 ultimately provided the upset of the night as businessman @entity219 defeated lt. gov. @entity223 , an african - american whose failure to win the top job could be seen as a repudiation of his boss , gov. @entity250			2
@entity251 is a likely presidential candidate in 2016 , and handing the governor 's mansion keys to a @entity11 will likely hurt his standing immeasurably .			0
