by @entity0 , political correspondent published : 19:20 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 19:23 est , 7 may 2013 cuts to the @entity4 will leave @entity5 defenceless and ‘ ripe for the taking ’ , the @entity2 veteran sir @entity1 has warned			1
in a rare intervention , sir @entity1 , who led the @entity9 task force that helped retake the @entity10 in 1982 , said @entity5 would be left unable to defend its interests around the world unless cuts to the fleet are reversed			1
and he warned that @entity5 could even lose its permanent seat on the @entity18 @entity17 if it is seen to be unable to defend overseas territories like the @entity10			1
fears : falklands veteran sir @entity1 said @entity5 would be left unable to defend its interests around the world and could even lose its permanent seat on the @entity18 @entity17 the warning came in a letter to the commons defence committee , which is investigating @entity5 ’s future defence needs			1
it is jointly signed by a number of other senior figures from the @entity10 era , including brigadier @entity31 , who led @entity32 during the conflict , and admiral sir @entity34 , who commanded the requisitioned troop ship @entity36 which was sunk by @entity38 missiles			0
calling for a change of course , they said defence cuts had already reduced @entity5 ’s standing in the world , with potentially dangerous consequences for @entity5 ’s trade and energy interests			2
they added : ‘ it is evident that the @entity5 is rapidly becoming a different nation by default and one less likely to be respected by friends and foes alike			2
‘ our strategic reach has been severely curtailed because we will no longer be able to support the @entity55 militarily in the key way which the @entity5 has done for decades			2
‘ this might put in doubt our position as a permanent member of the @entity17 if we become unable even to protect our own dependent territories			1
’ sir @entity1 singled out the ‘ debacle ’ surrounding the replacement of @entity5 ’s aircraft carriers , which will leave the fleet with no operational capacity for a decade			1
following a u-turn last year , ministers announced the new carriers @entity70 and @entity71 will be equipped with 12 jump jet @entity72 , at a cost of £ 500 million each			0
but they will not be ready to fly until 2020 , a decade after harrier jump jets went out of service			0
following a u-turn last year , ministers announced the new carriers @entity70 and @entity71 will be equipped with 12 jump jet @entity72 , at a cost of £ 500 million each even when they are ready , sir @entity1 said the new jets ‘ will not provide @entity5 with a full carrier strike capability ’			1
and he warned their use would make it impossible to deploy other key aircraft , such as air - to - air refuelling and airborne early warnings , from the carriers			0
the letter also casts doubt on government proposals to rely on military capability provided by allies , such as @entity93			0
‘ the altogether unreliable response of some @entity97 partners in @entity98 ought to have forewarned defence planners of this delusion , ’ it said			0
‘ further proof of this unjustifiable reliance is the possible withdrawal of the @entity93 carrier from service in the on - going attempts to save the @entity93 economy			0
this completely destroys the defence planning assumption that the @entity93 carrier will be a credible alternative for @entity5 power projection in the absence of @entity4 sea - air capabilities			2
’ sir @entity1 accused ministers of ‘ paying lip service ’ to the need to maintain credible defences , adding : ‘ this will not impress or deter those that would do us harm			1
failing to attend to this issue of great national import is tantamount to saying to our enemies that “ we are ripe for the taking ! ” ’ ‘ the altogether unreliable response of some @entity97 partners in @entity98 ought to have forewarned defence planners of this delusion , ’ it said			0
‘ further proof of this unjustifiable reliance is the possible withdrawal of the @entity93 carrier from service in the on - going attempts to save the @entity93 economy			0
this completely destroys the defence planning assumption that the @entity93 carrier will be a credible alternative for @entity5 power projection in the absence of @entity4 sea - air capabilities			2

sir @entity1 said @entity5 would be left unable to defend its interests
@entity5 could even lose permanent seat on the @entity18 @entity17
