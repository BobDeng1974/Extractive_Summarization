@entity0 was left with a view of a metal gate for the entirety of the @entity5 concert a wheelchair - bound @entity5 fan was left in tears during his concert after her view was obstructed by a metal gate and she was told to stand up when she complained about it to staff			1
@entity0 splashed out £ 77 on two tickets to watch her favourite singer perform at @entity16 's @entity15 ( @entity15 ) on october 18			1
the disabled 24 - year - old was left devastated after the vantage point she was given completely obstructed her view of the stage and she was stunned when told she should stand up when she complained to security staff			1
instead of receiving help , she was forced to stare at large blue metal railings in tears for the duration of the one - and - a - half - hour gig			1
yesterday ms @entity0 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , accused @entity15 of discrimination and said she was disgusted by the way they treated her			1
she fumed : ' @entity5 's other two shows were sold out so we were very lucky to get tickets			1
i could n't wait for it as he is one of my favourite singers			2
' but when i got there i realised i could n't see the stage			2
the gate obstructed the entire view and i do not understand how that is acceptable for the disabled bay			1
' the door supervisor told my sister @entity46 to just move me back and for me to stand up			1
i could n't believe my ears			0
' i found this incredibly rude and disrespectful considering that i ca n't stand up			2
he said the only other option was to move to the back of the arena			0
' they just wanted to shove me out of the way where you barely see anyway			0
' when my sister disagreed he dismissed her and stressed it was the only solution and could not offer any further help			0
' i paid the same as able - bodied people but my view was compromised due to the poor layout and i received no help to rectify the situation			2
' i felt discriminated against and i was left in tears for most of the evening			1
it completely ruined my night			0
' ms @entity0 has @entity67 , a progressive neurological illness which effects her balance and prevents her from standing for long periods			1
when she complained about the view ( pictured ) , the wheelchair - bound fan was told to move and stand up she was diagnosed with the condition when she was nine - years - old but has been in a wheelchair since february			1
she emailed to complain about her treatment at the concert which she attended with her sister and carer @entity46 , 21 , and her friend @entity78 , 21			2
but was outraged with the response she received last tuesday from the @entity15 - which is one of the biggest entertainment venues in @entity82			0
ms @entity0 , who works at @entity83 on the check - in desk , said : ' they basically told me it was all our own fault			1
' the door supervisor we named had a very different recollection of how he had helped us that evening			0
' he said my sister shook his hand and said ' thank you ' for being helpful , but that never happened			0
i know my sister , and she definitely did n't do that			0
' they said the railings had been there for my own safety , what did they think i was going to do , roll off down the stairs in my wheelchair ? ' they then emailed back a couple of weeks after saying maybe the staff member was having an " off - day " , which i thought was a bit of a understatement but unprofessional to say anyway			2
ms @entity0 had paid £ 77 for two tickets to the @entity5 concert to cover entry for herself and a carer , and a friend			1
pictured is @entity5 performing at the @entity114 in @entity115 three nights ago the @entity5 concert was held at the @entity15 in @entity16 ( pictured ) on october 18 ' i 've been to lots of concerts at other venues and have never had any problems like at the @entity15			1
' i wo n't be going back there , they have treated me appallingly			0
' @entity123 , general manager of @entity124 which runs the @entity15 , said : ' our customers ' enjoyment is of the utmost importance and it is always disappointing to hear a visitor is n't satisfied with their experience			0
' the barriers are essential for the safety of our visitors			0
' full consultations were held with the relevant groups and an independent assessor who represented disabled people whereby the use of these barriers was agreed as they are fully compliant in the disabled seating area			0
' we pride ourselves on our customer service and our staff did their utmost to offer a solution as due to the popularity of the event alternative seating was not possible on this occasion			2
' we are continually looking to improve our facilities to ensure complete customer satisfaction and take on board all feedback so this is something we are looking into			0
