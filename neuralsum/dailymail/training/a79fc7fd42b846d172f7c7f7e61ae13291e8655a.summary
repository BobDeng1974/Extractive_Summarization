cattle across @entity2 are being deafened by their own cow bells - which make more noise than a chainsaw on full - throttle , scientists have claimed			1
farmers have been warned not to adorn their livestock with the traditional 12lb - bells in a move that could signal the death of one of the country 's most iconic symbols			1
the large bells - primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures - can reach volumes of up to 113 decibels , which is louder than a chainsaw or a pneumatic drill			1
@entity23 's toll : the large bells - primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures - can reach volumes of up to 113 decibels worse still , researchers found that cows who wear the iron gongs eat less than their bell - free companions , although they are n't sure if that is down to their noise or weight			1
the findings were revealed in a paper by agricultural scientist @entity37 and her team of researchers at the @entity40 ( @entity40 )			0
they spent months testing more than 100 cows in 25 farms , monitoring their activity , head movements , reactions to sound and feeding behaviour			1
the paper suggests that thousands of cows – whose hearing is more sensitive than a human 's – may already be irreversibly deaf			0
anger : one farmer pointed out that the 12lb - bells used in the study were in fact size 31 and only used for one day a year on ceremonial occasions , like this in @entity60 , in the @entity2 @entity61 the bells : cow bells come in many shapes and sizes and are primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures @entity69 of the @entity2 animal protection group told daily @entity71 : ' we did n't need long university research to tell us that the bells are not beneficial to cows			1
' farmers will just have to spend a bit more time finding their cows in bad weather , like shepherds do			2
it 's difficult work ... but they chose it			0
' @entity37 suggested technology could be the answer , saying : ' in this it age we could replace the bell with a microchip and the farmer could then locate his cattle using a smartphone			0
' but farmers have reacted angrily to her suggestion , claiming gps signal would be patchy at best in the remote and hilly terrain of the @entity2 mountains			1
' they ca n't be serious , ' responded @entity98 , director of the @entity99 , in @entity71			0
' these researchers have completely missed the point			0
i wonder if they 've even stepped out of their lab and been to the mountains			2
' he pointed out that the 12lb - bells used in the study were in fact size 31 and only used for one day a year on ceremonial occasions			2
@entity112 spokesperson @entity111 was also displeased with the findings , saying : ' it would be the end of a myth , of an image of @entity2			0
' the row continues .			0

researchers in @entity121 studied more than 100 cows in 25 @entity2 farms
they found that traditional 12lb - cow bells can reach volumes of 113 decibels
they 've warned farmers to stop using the heavy bells to find cows in hills
they say farmers should *implant* chips into cows and find them with gps
but farmers react angrily , saying gps wo n't work in remote mountains
