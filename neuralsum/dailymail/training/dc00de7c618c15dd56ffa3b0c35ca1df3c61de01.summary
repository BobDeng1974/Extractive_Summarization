by @entity0 @entity2 users running older versions of @entity5 's ubiquitous software are at risk of attack , according to a new study			1
security researchers have uncovered a major flaw that affects @entity2 's @entity12 - part of the system responsible for encrypted data and cryptographic keys - on older software releases			1
keys are used to encrypt and hide information as people access certain apps , and the vulnerability means hackers could expose and steal banking data and passwords			1
security researchers have uncovered a major flaw that affects @entity2 ’s keystore - part of the system responsible for encrypted data and cryptographic keys			1
@entity5 has patched the issue in @entity2 @entity29 4.4 ( pictured left ) , but vulnerability still affects older software releases , including @entity32 2.2 ( pictured right ) @entity2 users running older versions of the operating system are being advised to carefully check apps before installing them			1
apps should only be installed from the official @entity37			0
where possible , users should also install the most up - to - date version of @entity2 available for their device			2
go to ' settings ' and then ' update ' to check for new releases			0
it is also advisable to run antivirus software on devices to scan for any malicious code or apps already installed			0
@entity12 is used to identify developers and users when they create , install and use apps			2
a team of experts at @entity54 spotted the flaw nine months ago , and flagged the vulnerability to @entity5			2
@entity5 has since issued a fix for its @entity2 4.4 @entity29 software - but that still leaves all older versions of the software at risk			1
this is believed to be 86 per cent of all @entity2 handsets in current use			0
@entity5 has designed @entity2 so that any installed apps need to be ' digitally signed ' with a certificate			2
@entity5 has designed @entity2 so that any installed apps need to be ' digitally signed ' with a certificate ( pictured )			2
this certificate has a private key that is stored by the app 's developer			0
the flaw in this system means attackers can execute code to apps and steal keys on banking , and other , sensitive apps @entity5 has designed @entity2 so that any installed apps need to be ' digitally signed ' with a certificate			1
this certificate has a private key that is stored by the app 's developer and @entity2 uses it to identify who created the app. it is designed to stop hackers from being able to add malicious code to a developer 's app without their permission			0
the flaw discovered by @entity54 means attackers can execute code to apps that could leak keys used by banking , and other , sensitive apps			1
it could also reveal pin or finger patterns used to unlock handsets , for example			1

the flaw discovered by @entity54 means attackers can execute such code to apps that could leak and steal keys on banking , and other , sensitive applications			1
it could also reveal pin or finger patterns used to unlock handsets , for example			1
but , to get access to the keys , hackers would need to install a malicious app onto a vulnerable handset in the first place			0
in theory , because banking apps ask for passwords every time they are used , and have added security measures , they are more secure than other apps , for example			1

security researchers discovered the flaw in @entity2 ’s @entity12
@entity12 *protects* encrypted data used to gain secure access to apps
attackers could use the flaw to get hold of keys used by banking apps
it could also reveal pin codes and patterns used to unlock devices
@entity5 has released a fix for @entity2 4.4 @entity29 devices
but the vulnerability still affects devices running *4.3* @entity177 or older
