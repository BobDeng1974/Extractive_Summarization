by @entity0 for @entity1 a mother - of - one died after enduring six years of cosmetic surgery to correct facial disfigurement she suffered following a savage beating			1
@entity6 , 44 , had been punched , kicked , battered with metal sticks and had a plate broken over her head after being caught up in a row at a house party in 2007			1
she died a day after being found collapsed at her home in @entity13 , @entity14 on @entity15 last year having suffered a suspected blood clot to the brain			1
@entity6 , pictured , died after enduring six years of cosmetic surgery to correct facial disfigurement she suffered following a savage beating due to the injuries she sustained during the attack , miss @entity6 contracted a flesh eating bug which destroyed the skin around her scalp and round her eyes			1
it left her scarred for life and she had to wear sunglasses to hide her painful scars			2
over the years miss @entity6 underwent several skin grafts including many to her eyelids but was still having problems with her scalp and she told her family she ' did not want to go on			1
' on @entity15 she was discovered collapsed at her home by a friend and rushed to hospital in a ' profoundly comatose state ' and died the following day			1
police who investigated the beating discovered miss @entity6 's attackers were friends of convicted terrorist leader @entity44 ' @entity43 who fled to the @entity46 mainland after being expelled by the @entity47 in his native @entity48			1
miss @entity6 subsequently testified in court over the attack and another woman later went to jail for six months after being convicted of assault			1
charges were dropped against two other people			2
today , following an inquest , the dead woman 's family blamed miss @entity6 's death on the savage beating she received at one of @entity43 's hideouts in @entity63 , @entity64			1
her sister @entity66 , 33 , said : ' she lost her self confidence because of the attack and quite literally never recovered from it			0
the bug she contracted as a result made it all the much worse			1
' she had to have all the skin removed from her face , her nose all the way around to the back of her head and you could nearly see through to the temples			1
@entity6 , pictured with her son @entity81 , was found collapsed at her home in @entity13 , @entity14 by a friend and rushed to hospital in a ' profoundly comatose state ' ' she was always in and out of hospital , she said she had had enough and did n't want to go on			1
it has just been horrendous			0
' her father @entity88 , 69 , said : ' what happened to @entity6 was sickening and she was always blown away by the fact one of her attackers only got six months			1
' it seems her attackers were drugged up and battered her with a steel bar			1
they then kept her in a bedroom until she was brought back to @entity96			0
one of these yobs even urinated on her			0
this attack was so life - changing it must have some connection with her death			2
' my daughter was a beautiful clever girl but her condition stopped her from doing things			0
the operations got too much for her and in some ways it was like she had given up			0
i do n't think she could take it any more even though she was a really strong girl			0
' the beating occurred after miss @entity6 travelled to @entity110 to attend a party with one of @entity43 's closest friends			1
at the party , a bust up occurred between @entity116 and the friend and later she was set upon by another guest , @entity118 , then 44			1
@entity43 himself , who now lives in @entity64 , attended the court case to watch miss @entity6 tell how she was punched and kicked by three people until she lost consciousness			1
the family of @entity116 , pictured left and right with her son @entity81 , blamed her death on the savage beating she received in 2007 she was brought back to @entity96 but she developed an infection of the scalp and after being admitted to @entity129 she was diagnosed as having the flesh eating bug necrotising fascitis			1
her gp dr @entity134 told the inquest : ' it causes the bacteria to destroy the skin and in her case the whole of her scalp , the skin was destroyed and to some extent the skin on her upper eye lids			2
' he said miss @entity6 suffered life changing facial injuries and would wear sunglasses to disguise her painful scars			2
over the years she was to undergo a series of operations and had several skin grafts including many her eyelids and was still having problems with her scalp			2
dr @entity134 said that the procedures had been ' very painful			0
' the inquest heard that for her daily pain she was prescribed strong painkillers , anti-depressants and was also prescribed @entity162 after developing a @entity163 , reducing her blood 's ability to clot			0
shortly before her death she was said to have complained of headaches , hallucinations and confusion			0
police who investigated the beating discovered miss @entity6 's attackers were friends of convicted terrorist leader @entity174 , pictured in @entity13 in 2005 , who fled to the @entity46 mainland after being expelled by the @entity47 in his native @entity48 when miss @entity6 was later found dying at home , it was first believed that she had been the victim of a serious assault and an investigation was carried out - but any third party involvement was ruled out			1
@entity183 dr @entity182 said that her injuries had ' mimicked ' a physical trauma but had in fact been as a result of a naturally occurring source like an aneurysm or infection			0
he said her death was caused by intercranal haemorrhage and @entity162 treatment for @entity163			0
he said : ' @entity193 was caused by bleeding to the brain			0
i have carefully considered the bleeding to the injuries in 2007 and could n't find a link between these two events			0
' this is a naturally occurring bleed although i ca n't be sure what the original source was			0
the blood was not clotting as it ought to be			0
' assistant coroner @entity204 returned a conclusion of natural causes			0
he added : ' the police were originally concerned when admitted that injuries may have been caused by some form of criminal activity			2
' her death may have been in some way related to the clearly horrific injuries sustained in 2007 that required her to have very painful operations over many years			2
' the conclusion of dr @entity182 is that neither of these are correct although very badly injured in 2007 , that incident has not caused her death nor has she been the subject of any trauma or assault			0
' it was a death at a very young age , a bleed on the brain , that has occurred spontaneously			0
' @entity162 therapy was a contributory factor , when the blood starts it is difficult to stop			0
she died from natural causes although her death was contributed to by appropriate @entity162 therapy which was required to treat her dvt			2
