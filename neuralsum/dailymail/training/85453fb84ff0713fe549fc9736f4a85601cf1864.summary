by @entity0 published : 13:24 est , 6 february 2013 @entity2 : 02:41 est , 7 february 2013 plans are underway to recreate the famous @entity5 fields of poppies to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity9 - in @entity10			1
the @entity12 battlefields , which saw some of the conflict 's bloodiest fighting , were immortalised in lieutenant colonel @entity17 's iconic war poem			1
and the image of fields strewn with graves and poppies ' row on row ' became an international symbol of remembrance for all those who died			1
remembrance : the stunning fields of poppies in @entity5			1
plans are underway to recreate the famous scene in @entity32 , @entity33 now @entity10 is set to get its own version , as civic leaders in @entity32 , @entity33 , plan to fill a country park with the blood - red flowers			1
they already have bought thousands of poppy seeds and are looking for an historic aircraft to scatter some of them in a fly - past next year			1
it 's hoped the idea would serve as a poignant reminder of those who sacrified their lives in the ' war to end all wars ' from 1914 - 1918			2
and it could boost tourism as people flock to pay their respects			0
@entity54 councillor @entity53 is leading the project			0
@entity56 said : ' having our own @entity57 this side of the @entity60 would be wonderful			0
' it 's in the very early stages at the moment but @entity64 would like to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the war			1
' here in @entity32 we are keen to be involved with that , especially since we have a great number of veterans amongst us			0
killing fields : the @entity12 battlefields saw some of the conflict 's bloodiest fighting and were immortalised in lieutenant colonel @entity17 's iconic war poem ' we 've identified an area in the @entity78 where we would like to plant some poppy seeds			1
' and we 've made enquiries about possibly getting an aircraft to drop more poppy seeds in a ceremony as well			0
' i will be talking to various groups and organisations over the coming months to see how we can go about taking the idea further			0
' the town of @entity32 has the highest ratio of veterans in the country - with 68 veterans per 1,000 people , @entity89 figures reveal			2
@entity32 has a rich military history and is the home of the @entity98 @entity56 , a @entity99 veteran , said : ' we have a higher than average number of veterans , having been a garrison town for over 250 years			2
' all the armed forces have operated from @entity32 at one time , so there 's quite a background and i want to make sure they 're looked after			2
in @entity109 fields the poppies @entity112 the crosses , row on row , that mark our place ; and in the @entity116 larks , still bravely singing , @entity107 heard amid the guns @entity118 are the @entity119			2
short days @entity120 lived , felt dawn , saw sunset glow , loved and were loved , and now we @entity123 up our quarrel with the foe : to you from failing hands we throwthe torch ; be yours to hold it high.if ye break faith with us who @entity133 shall not sleep , though poppies @entity109 fields			2
' i believe it 's extremely important that we do n't forget the millions of people who gave their lives from 1914 - 1918			0
' and also those people who subsequently suffered a miserable life after fighting			0
' @entity56 has already had an offer of a @entity143 , a single seat bi-plane , to take part in the flypast and drop more seeds and poppies , but more could join in			0
@entity56 said ' i am sure that a lot of people in @entity33 will have fairly historic planes and would like to take the opportunity to fly over this area			1
' the idea of our own @entity57 is a truly exciting prospect			0
' the proposals form part of a 10 -15 year project to revitalise the 150 - plus hectare @entity78 site , which has two lakes and three walking areas			0
@entity164 plans to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of @entity9 include a five million pound education programme for schoolchildren			1
they include trips to the battlefields in @entity12 and @entity172			1
and there 's backing for an overhaul of the @entity175 , south @entity176 , prime minister @entity177 has said			0
the @entity178 is also inviting applications for support to mark @entity9 centenary events .			1
