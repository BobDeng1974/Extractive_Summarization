no one knew she was stealing from 2005 to 2012 until she left and a new finance director found a black hole in the company accounts ' your offending was motivated by greed and the desire to live beyond your means			1
you breached the high level of trust given to you by your employer			1

one of the aggravating features is you sought to blame loyal members of staff , including the former finance director @entity95 saying that he allowed you to borrow £ 40,000 over four years			1
' mr @entity95 is now dead and can not defend his good character , but you knew that in your police interview			2

' @entity52 is a corporate clothing supplier and was founded by tailor @entity154 who died in 2008			0

in one example she made it look like a payment to clothing outworkers in @entity187 , @entity188			0
in another case she paid herself £ 3,875 - a - month mirroring a director ’s company pension payment so it was overlooked or thought to be an error			1

in december 2011 she gave herself an additional £ 4,000 @entity198 bonus			0
