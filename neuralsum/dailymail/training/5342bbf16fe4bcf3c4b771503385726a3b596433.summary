@entity1 chancellor @entity0 raised eyebrows when she was pictured alongside children with blacked - up faces on the steps of the chancellery in @entity7 earlier today			1
fortunately for the @entity10 leader , the visiting children were not part of a political stunt but carol singers dressed up as the three wise men for the @entity1 @entity15 , known as @entity16 ' day			1
as ms @entity0 joined in the charity carolling , news came that her coalition partners , the @entity19 , are struggling to stay in parliament			1
controversial : @entity1 chancellor @entity0 , right , looks at a caroller , depicting one of the @entity16 during a reception for carol singers from all over @entity1 at the chancellery in in @entity7 today the chancellor ’s @entity26 are riding high in national polls at about 40 per cent , but as her partners in power , the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , meet in @entity31 this weekend their future looks bleak			1
current polls indicate that the @entity19 would fall short of the 5 per cent threshold to enter parliament , meaning @entity0 would be forced to seek a coalition with the @entity37 in order to secure a third term in government			2
the @entity19 ’s support has fallen from a record 14.6 per cent in the 2009 election to four per cent in a recent poll			0
although the costumes of the children may appear controversial , the blacked - up faces of the children joining the chancellor today is part of the @entity51 , or star singer , tradition of @entity54 , the @entity16 ' day , when children go from house to house in groups of four and sing carols for charity			2
it is tradition that one of the kings are black and it is not seen as racist , but part of the traditional costume			0
traditional celebration : children carol singers , some with traditional ' blackened ' faces , sing for charity with ms @entity0 in celebration of the @entity1 @entity72 ' day @entity0 approved : the @entity1 chancellor watches a skit during the charity carol service this is a predominantly @entity77 practice where three children dress up as the wise men who visited baby @entity80 and one child carries a star on a stick for the three wise men to follow			1
the three kings and their star ‘ bless ’ houses with magi as their raise money for an annual good cause			0
this year ’s cause in @entity1 is @entity93 hospitals			0
three @entity94 is celebrated in the 6th of january which is a public holiday in three @entity1 states , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , and marks the end of the @entity102 celebrations			0
joining in : @entity0 praised the children for their dedication to this year 's cause			0

@entity0 was joined by carol singers in controversial costumes
