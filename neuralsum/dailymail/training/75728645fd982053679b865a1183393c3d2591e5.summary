those with a fear of flying may want to look away now			2
@entity2 boasts the dubious honour of being known as the world 's most dangerous airport and one look at its unique airstrip will explain why			2
with a fall of 9,200 ft awaiting passengers at the end of the runaway , flying to or from this @entity13 destination is not for the faint of heart			1
braced for impact : a plane pictured coming into land at @entity19 's @entity2 - the most dangerous landing strip in the world pressure : tenzing - @entity23 in @entity2 , @entity24 , eastern @entity19 , does n't have a control tower , radar or navigation devices - meaning pilots have to rely on what they can see from their cockpit to land and takeoff tenzing - @entity23 , also known as @entity2 , is a single landing strip in the town of @entity33 , in @entity24 , eastern @entity19 , and has been named by the @entity34 and many seasoned travellers as being the most dangerous airport in the world			1
these photographs , captured by photographer @entity39 , 34 , capture the petrifying landing			1
' it was a very scary experience flying in the airship , mainly because two days before my flight , the plane from the same company had crashed and 14 people died , ' said @entity39			2
' this airport in @entity2 does not have any radar or navigation devices ; so the pilot can only depend on what they can see from the plane 's cockpit			1
do n't look down : the tiny runway ends at a cliff edge with a 9,200ft drop to the ground below daunting : this image shows the view from the cockpit of a plane coming in to land at @entity2 ' because the airport is on the mountain ridge , when you start descending you have to land			1
there is no option to stop descending and have a second try			0
' with a sloped runway just 20 meters wide and 460 meters long , less than a tenth of the length of the standard 5,500 metres at international airports , this is one of the steepest approach pathways in the world			1
since the 1970 's , @entity33 airport has had an astonishing amount of accidents , with the number now reaching into the double figures			0
the most severe accident to date being the 8th october 2008 flight , where the aircraft crashed on final approach and caught fire , killing eighteen passengers and crew			0
challenging : the 460 metre long runway - less than a tenth of the length of those at international airports - is also situated on a steep incline brave travellers : a group of passengers on a plane coming into land at the most dangerous airport in the world all aboard : a group of tourists wait to board a plane departing from @entity2			1
the airport is the main route for those trying to reach the @entity109 and for those looking to scale @entity111 , @entity2 is the nerve rattling start of many expeditions			0
@entity39 says : ' there are two ways to reach the @entity109 - fly 45min from @entity2 or hike for approximately five days			2
needless to say most of people chose the first option			0
' tourists are the " golden vain " for local community			0
they spend money in lodges , hotels and restaurants			0
' without the airstrip the number of tourists visiting the area will be significantly lower			0
' a plane begins to lift off the ground just a few metres before the end of the runway and the 9,200ft drop easy option : many travellers use @entity2 to reach the @entity109 as the alternative involves a five day hike fast link : it takes just 45 minutes to reach the @entity109 flying from @entity2			1

@entity143 - @entity23 does n't have a control tower , radar or navigation
pilots are forced to rely on the view from their cockpit to land and takeoff
the 460 metre long runway - a tenth of standard length - is also on a slope
if a pilot *misjudges* landing or takeoff , they face a 9,200ft fall off a cliff edge
