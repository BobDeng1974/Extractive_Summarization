for the first time , water ice has been spotted in images of craters on the planet @entity5 by @entity7 ’s messenger spacecraft			1
the groundbreaking discovery reveals the shape and size of the ice in the planet ’s polar regions			1
it might also help us discover how water was transported to other planets in the solar system such as @entity19 and @entity20			1
scientists at the @entity22 have spotted ice in visible image of @entity5 for the first time			1
one area was @entity27 crater , near @entity5 's north pole			0
on the right is a higher contrast image of the crater , revealing an expanse of ice on its floor water ice was speculated to exist on @entity36 back in 2012			2
however , this is the first time ice has been seen in visible images of the surface			2
found in permanently shadowed craters , it is thought to be tens of metres thick but may extend over vast regions of the crater floors			1
in addition the ice may be relatively young , on the order of just ten or 100 million years			0
for all its bland ' dead ' appearance , @entity5 is a very interesting place it is the smallest planet in our solar system - only slightly larger than the @entity20 's moon			1
on its sunward half , the planet sizzles at a temperature of @entity57 ( 800 ° f ) while its night side maintains – 173 ° @entity59 )			0
this means that while one side is cold enough to freeze water , the other quickly boils anything on the surface			0
it is the closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 36 million miles ( 58 million km ) or 0.39 @entity69 ( one @entity69 is the @entity20 - sun distance )			1
@entity5 has a solid iron core that measures more than half the planet 's diameter			1
@entity20 , by contrast , has a solid core that 's just 9.5 per cent of its overall girth			2
one day on @entity5 takes 58 @entity20 days and 15 hours			2
@entity5 makes a complete orbit around the sun ( a year in @entity5 time ) in just 88 @entity20 days			1
why the ice can only exist in these craters , and not elsewhere on the surface , is due to @entity5 's position in the solar system			2
@entity5 is the closest planet to the sun , at an average distance of just 36 million miles ( 58 million kilometres )			1
it completes a rotation about once every 58 @entity20 days , meaning that its entire surface is subjected to the full brunt of the sun. without an atmosphere to protect the surface the temperatures reach a scorching @entity97 ( 800 ° f ) in the day this drops to -173 ° @entity99 ) at night			0
these huge fluctuations make it impossible for ice or water to form on most of the surface			0
however , in the polar regions of @entity5 , some of the crater floors stay in endless shadow			1
as the planet rotates it tilts in such a way that sunlight can never enter some of the craters at these extreme regions , so they stay eternally dark			0
this means that ice can survive , as it is never heated to a high temperature by the sun and instead stays far below zero			0
back in 2012 , @entity7 spotted water ice in its permanently shadowed craters through a number of indirect methods			1
but with these new images the ice has now been directly imaged , something dr @entity125 , the @entity126 , tells @entity127 is ‘ very exciting ’			1
this close - up of the @entity27 crater image shows the ice in more detail			0
dr @entity125 tells @entity127 it is likely tens of metres thick but may extend across almost the entirety of the crater floor			1
how the ice came to be there though is somewhat of a mystery			0
it may have been carried by a comet this image reveals the permanently shadowed surface within @entity144 crater , the largest crater in @entity5 's north polar region			1
the area in yellow , a zoomed in segment of the pink rectangle , is thought to be water ice residing inside the crater ‘ the main implications , aside from it being cool to see ice on @entity5 , is that these cold traps are cold enough to have had ice for billions of years , ’ says dr @entity125			1
however it ’s thought that some of the ice was deposited fairly recently in cosmic terms , perhaps just ten or 100 million years ago			0
‘ even though you have water ice , we do n’t think there ’s the other things you need to have life , ’ she explains			0
‘ we might not have life there , but understanding the delivery of water from the early solar system to @entity20 , @entity19 and other places that might have life			2
understanding how water was distributed has implications for the solar system			0
’ to find the ice the researchers zeroed in on craters that had previously been identified to have bright material that could be ice			0
this included @entity144 , the largest crater in @entity5 ’s north polar region			0
by increasing the contrast in images , the ice in the crater floor was revealed			0
dr @entity125 adds that the discovery may indicate ice formation on @entity5 is something that is still continuing today			1
but , most importantly , ice was likely taken to the planet by comets			0
it is thought that other planets in the solar system , including @entity20 , had water and possibly life delivered in this way			2
discovering how this ice came to be on @entity5 could , in turn , reveal the origins of our own water and ice on @entity20 , and even ourselves			2
messenger ( @entity209 , @entity210 ) is a @entity7 - sponsored scientific investigation of the planet @entity5 and the first space mission designed to orbit the planet closest to the @entity216 it entered orbit around @entity5 on 17 march 2011			0

scientists have spotted ice in visible image of @entity5 for the first time
the discovery was made in the planet 's permanently shadowed craters
@entity5 is the closest planet to the sun and has no atmosphere
this means its surface can get very hot , melting and *evaporating* ice
however at its polar regions some craters are in *constant* shadow
this means ice can survive on their floors for millions of years
until now only indirect evidence for this ice had been found
but by *raising* the contrast on images the scientists revealed ice
dr @entity125 tells @entity127 this could help explain how water and life were brought to planets like @entity20 and maybe @entity19
