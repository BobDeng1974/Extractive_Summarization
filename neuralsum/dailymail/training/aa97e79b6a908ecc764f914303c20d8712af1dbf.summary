click here to read the fa cup final match report from @entity2			0
@entity3 was signed by @entity4 to be the matchwinning difference in their biggest games , but in the club 's most pivotal match of the campaign the @entity9 international again failed to live up to the hype and expectation during their @entity16 3 - 2 comeback win against @entity17			1
the @entity19 ' record £ 42.5million transfer for the midfield maestro in september was met with mild fanfare by fans at the start of the season as they looked to end their nine - year trophy drought			1
however , the former @entity28 star proved relatively ineffective against @entity30 's side in another disappointing big - game performance			0
fruitless : @entity3 ( right ) was disappointing in @entity4 's 3 - 2 extra time fa cup final win vs @entity17 at @entity2 on the ball : @entity3 tries to escape the attention of @entity35 during their @entity2 showpiece on saturday the 25 - year - old was signed by @entity39 as the man that could be the go - to - guy for the @entity43 outfit but on the basis of his first season in @entity46 this notion has a lot to be desired			1
playing ' in the hole ' behind @entity50 , @entity3 failed to cause the @entity17 defence any problems with either a penetrating through ball or a piece of skill that his reputation commanded at the start of the season			2
the midfielder played 84 passes with an impressive accuracy of 82.1 per cent , but none of note that hurt @entity66 captain @entity65 and his team - mates			0
hotspot : @entity69 's heat map of @entity3 shows he rarely got into @entity17 's box during their @entity16 trailing 2 - 1 in the first - half , @entity3 squandered a fantastic opportunity to bring his side level completely missing the ball from a low cross - when a goal looked like an inevitable outcome			2
that chance was @entity3 's only notable contribution to the game as he looked neat in possession , but when compared to team - mates @entity83 and @entity85 the duo were far more effective at @entity2 - highlighted by man - of - the - match @entity83 scoring the winning goal in extra time			1
disappointing : @entity3 contributed just one shot and a 33 % cross completion rate during the @entity2 encounter @entity85 started the @entity4 comeback with a sweetly - struck free - kick in the first - half and his stats show he made 79 passes and with a better accuracy than his team - mate of 89.9 per cent			2
@entity4 's hero @entity83 was as equally as impressive as the @entity99 , making 105 passes with an 87.6 per cent accuracy			0
revival : @entity85 ( left ) started @entity4 's comeback with a first - half free kick against @entity17 @entity105 performer : man - of - the - match @entity83 ( right ) outshone team - mate @entity3 on saturday matchwinning moment : @entity83 ( second right ) scored the winner for @entity4 in the 109th minute vs @entity17 this is evident furthermore by @entity3 's total contribution of one blocked shot , and a 33 per cent cross completion rate during the @entity2 showpiece			1
there have been accusations that the @entity9 needs world - class around him to perform like he did at @entity28 , but if so what does that mean say about the ability of @entity3 or @entity4 's squad ? at the @entity121 he was surrounded by the ilk of @entity123 and @entity124 and while the @entity19 can boast the likes of @entity50 and @entity126 - it is a fair assessment that the latter two are not in the same calibre as the former – but then should n’t the 25 - year - old step up and deliver for his team - mates in the biggest of games ? all smiles : @entity3 ( right ) and @entity134 ( left ) celebrate ending the club 's nine - year trophy drought his signing was meant to be the @entity19 ' game - changer but as @entity28 look to add the @entity141 title to their @entity143 triumph this season , it can be heavily questioned if @entity4 did really get what they bargained for			1
to @entity4 supporters it may not matter as they finally ended their trophy hoodoo and everyone ’s entitled to the odd bad game			0
but , for a £ 42.5million investment , they should expect better from @entity3 .			0
