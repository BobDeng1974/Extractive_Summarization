by @entity0 correspondent a future king sleeps peacefully in the arms of his doting mother in a family snapshot ... taken by his grandfather			0
previous royal heirs , prince @entity7 included , have had their first official portraits taken by society legends such as sir @entity10 and @entity11			2
but prince george alexander louis of @entity13 owes his to a humble ‘ point and shoot ’ wielded by @entity17 ’s father , @entity16			1
the @entity13 's cocker spaniel @entity29 , right , emerged unscathed that 's better : mr @entity16 's second photo produces much more appealing results , with the couple and their sleeping prince emerging from the blinding sunlight and the setting ? the @entity38 ’ sun - dappled back garden in @entity40 , with family pets @entity29 and @entity26 even getting in on the act			1
the finished result may have charm but is technically poor and lacks the gravitas of previous official photographs , according to experts			1
critics will also no doubt seize on mr @entity16 ’s decision to break the cardinal rule of photography – shooting into the light			1
but according to celebrity photographer @entity54 , the snapshots are ‘ refreshing ’			0
he told the @entity55 : ‘ it ’s an unusual decision but perhaps reflects the young approach that prince @entity7 wants to bring to bear			0
‘ the decision to take them in such an informal manner means they , perhaps , lack the level of gravitas that would normally be expected			0
' but on the whole i would say this is quite refreshing			0
’ the boy who will be king : @entity24 in his mother 's arms he added : ‘ taking a professional portrait of a young baby is quite an intrusive procedure , given the lighting and strobes you would need			1
‘ so perhaps they have had the right idea after all			0
it ’s just a different approach and the images are rather charming			0
’ @entity82 said the photographs were taken with an inexpensive camera in early august while the @entity23 and @entity17 were staying with internet millionaires @entity85 and @entity16 at their £ 4.8million @entity40 mansion			1
both photos show the couple posing with @entity24 , who is swaddled in the same shawl by @entity92 firm @entity91 that he left hospital in			1
was this the maestro 's first effort ? mr @entity16 , left , took this photo of wife @entity85 and daughter @entity17 in 1982 ( right ) similar : mr @entity16 's pictures of the @entity99 on the grass in his @entity40 garden echo those of the young @entity7 taken in the grounds of @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 @entity17 is wearing a £ 46 fuchsia - coloured knot front dress by maternity wear firm @entity108 , but appears to have shed a great deal of her baby weight			1
@entity7 is casually dressed in a blue checked shirt , tucked into jeans , and his favourite @entity114 - style belt			0
both look a little baggy - eyed due to lack of sleep – the prince more than his wife – but are clearly overjoyed at being parents to a beautiful , healthy baby boy			0
given the illustrious history of royal family portraits , the @entity122 ' decision to use one of proud grandpa @entity125 's happy family snaps is a startling break with tradition			1
according to well - placed sources , the decision was very much @entity7 ’s and @entity17 ’s			1
it is understood the couple were keen ‘ not to burst the happy little family bubble ’ they have existed in at the @entity137 home since @entity24 ’s birth			1
first shots : mr @entity16 's images are the first pictures of the young @entity99 since @entity24 was introduced to the world outside @entity143 last month ‘ they are a young couple who have just had their first baby and are enjoying time as a family together but , of course , there has been huge demand from the public to see some official photographs of @entity24 , ’ said an aide			1
‘ it seemed perfectly natural to them to pose for a few nice family snapshots which they could then issue			0
it [ the @entity137 home ] is just where they feel happy and most comfortable			2
’ the @entity55 also understands the couple were keen to take the wind out of the sails of the huge international market for unofficial paparazzi pictures of @entity24 by releasing their own as soon as possible			1
the first official portrait of prince @entity170 is a study in royal portraiture			1
taken by legendary @entity174 photographer , sir @entity10 , the image of the @entity176 gazing at her son was shot at @entity178 in december 1948 when he was just a month old			2
fast - forward more than 30 years , and a startled - looking prince @entity7 is introduced to the world by the @entity176 ’s brother - in - law @entity11 , another celebrated photographer			0
traditional : @entity10 's 1948 photo of @entity170 ( left ) and the formal portrait of prince @entity7 and his parents ( right ) by @entity11 in 1982 although more relaxed , the photo is still a formal portrait of a future king , proudly showing off the next generation of the family line			2
the @entity23 and @entity17 of @entity13 ’s decision to use one of @entity191 ’s happy family snaps is thus a substantial break with tradition			1
according to sources , the decision was very much @entity7 and @entity17 ’s			2
‘ it ’s where they feel happy and most comfortable , ’ said an aide			0
they went on to explain that the pictures were a mark of thanks for the privacy they had been given after the birth			0
‘ they asked the media to give them some time as a family and the @entity213 media have done that , ’ they said			0
@entity17 ’s father ignored photography advice on his own website when he took the first snaps of the @entity23 and @entity17 with @entity24			1
the @entity220 website tells amateur photographers to ensure ‘ natural light is behind you ’ when taking pictures at family occasions			2
but in his images of the couple with the newborn prince , mr @entity16 pictured them with the sun behind them , casting their faces into shadow			2
other advice on the site includes dressing children so their outfits do n’t clash and using ‘ toilet humour ’ to make them laugh			0
as the photographer , @entity16 is automatically entitled to copyright of the image under the @entity241			2
but last night it emerged that he has already handed over ownership of the pictures			0
this means he wo n’t be entitled to any money when they are printed – and @entity17 and @entity7 will be able to control their use .			0

@entity16 took the official portrait at their family home in @entity40 and even included dogs @entity29 and @entity26
pictures show a *smiling* @entity23 and @entity17 holding a sleeping @entity24 in the sunny garden
critics say the photographs are charming but technically poor as he shot into the light
sources said the couple chose not to have a professional photographer so not to ' burst the happy little family bubble '
