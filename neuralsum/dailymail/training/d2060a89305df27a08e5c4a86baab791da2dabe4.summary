by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 17 may 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 18 may 2013 the inquest into the death of poisoned spy @entity3 could be scrapped and replaced with a public inquiry to allow evidence to be heard in secret			1
coroner sir @entity7 ruled today that he can not hear evidence on whether mr @entity3 's death could have been prevented , or any alleged links to the involvement of the @entity13 state , in public			1
mr @entity3 's widow @entity15 described the decision as a ' frightening precedent ' and ' a tragedy for @entity20 justice			1
' justice : the family of @entity3 want his inquest to be held in public but a coroner has upheld an appeal by the @entity20 @entity27 for parts to be heard behind closed doors mr @entity3 , 43 , was poisoned with radioactive polonium - 210 while drinking tea at the @entity32 in @entity34 's @entity33 in 2006			1
his family believes he was working for @entity36 at the time and was killed on the orders of the @entity39			0
under fire : foreign secretary @entity41 has been accused by mr @entity3 's family of putting trade with @entity13 before exposing the truth about his death the coroner 's ruling was published today after he accepted an application by the @entity20 @entity27 to keep certain information under wraps			2
evidence can not be heard in secret as part of an inquest , but could be as part of a public inquiry			2
sir @entity7 said : ' it is my present view that i should hear submissions as to whether i should invite the secretary of state ( the home secretary ) on behalf of @entity64 to consider whether the power to hold an inquiry should be exercised in this case			2
' he said that the issues of preventability and @entity13 involvement are of ' central importance ' to the investigation into mr @entity3 's death			2
addressing the first issue , he said his duty to carry out ' a full , fair and fearless investigation ' would be hampered if it was not included			0
he also said that excluding key evidence on the issue of @entity13 involvement would cause him ' grave concern '			0
the coroner went on : ' were an inquiry to be held into the circumstances of mr @entity3 's death , the relevant material could be taken into account			0
' a statement from mrs @entity3 's solicitors said : ' this is a very sad day for mrs @entity3 , a tragedy for @entity20 justice which has until now been respected around the world , and it is frightening precedent for all of those , around the world , who have been trying so hard to expose the crimes committed by conspiracy of organised that operate from the @entity39			1
' it added : ' mrs @entity3 is utterly dismayed by the coroner 's decision to abandon his search for the truth about @entity13 state responsibility for her husband 's death			0
' the effect of today 's ruling is to protect those responsible for ordering the murder of a @entity20 citizen on the streets of @entity34 , and to allow the @entity13 government to shield behind a claim for secrecy made by @entity41 with the backing of the prime minister @entity117			1
' ' all those concerned with exposing the truth will be shocked and saddened that a political deal has been done between the two governments to prevent the truth from ever seeing the light of day			0
' the statement from mrs @entity3 's solicitors said they would now be pressing the coroner to order a full public inquiry as a matter of urgency as this is ' the only way now that the truth can be exposed ' despite meaning secret evidence will be considered in a closed session			1
@entity132 , a friend of the @entity3 family and his widow @entity15 , said the decision was ' deeply dismaying ' , and that it was ' upsetting ' that in his view @entity20 government had prioritised its political relationship with @entity13 over the need to hold an open inquest			1
he said : ' it appears the @entity20 government is more concerned about the use of chemical weapons in @entity144 than radioactive weapons being used on the streets of @entity34			0
' however mr @entity132 added : ' on the other hand , it 's an admission by the @entity20 government that the @entity13 state is culpable because otherwise they would not have requested immunity			0
that in itself is a partial victory for @entity155			0
