it is @entity1 versus @entity2 on saturday evening , a match that has in every season since the @entity5 began featured at least one team with genuine title credentials			1
where once , @entity8 and sir @entity9 knew the result would likely shape the destination of that over-sized silverware , now the clubs are in a modest battle for the final @entity17 spot			1
neither side is in the top four currently and you have to trawl back to september 1998 for the last occasion that was the case heading into this fixture			1
@entity2 beat @entity40 to edge their rivals by a point and went on to claim the @entity43			2
it seems improbable in the extreme that a similar story could unfold this year			0
before and after that match at @entity49 in september 1998 , when @entity1 were eighth and @entity2 10th , the fixture was a premium one in the top - flight calendar			1
for nine consecutive seasons from 1995 - 96 to 2003 - 04 , @entity2 and @entity1 shared the crown between them , many times finishing one and two in the table			1
the matches where they faced off directly would often define each of those seasons			0
@entity62 did for @entity63 in march 1998 to get @entity8 a win that would see his side claw back an 11 - point gap on route to the double			2
@entity2 's players spray champagne as they celebrate winning the @entity5 title in may 2000 @entity62 ( left ) scores past @entity73 at @entity74 to give @entity1 a 1 - 0 win in 1998 @entity8 's men celebrate being crowned @entity5 champions at @entity49 back in may 1998 in april 2003 @entity2 clinched a 2 - 2 draw at @entity49 from behind that invigorated their charge and had @entity9 running across the pitch to celebrate			1
had @entity83 converted a last - minute penalty at @entity74 in september 2003 , the @entity82 would never have happened			0
the reaction from @entity86 et al following the 0 - 0 draw painted a picture of its importance			0
fast - forward 13 months and to the 2 - 0 defeat in @entity92 that stopped @entity1 's unbeaten run at 49 games and triggered a food fight in the tunnel which left @entity9 with pizza on his lapel and a @entity100 nickname coined			2
@entity22 's fury at @entity23 in the @entity49 tunnel in february 2005 was fuelled because he was aware of the overall significance of the game			0
@entity105 defender @entity86 shouts in the face of @entity83 during a feisty encounter in 2003 @entity23 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) had to be calmed down in the @entity49 tunnel in 2005 @entity22 ( left ) and @entity23 also came to blows during @entity2 's away win during the 1999 - 2000 season @entity111 , under @entity112 , would finally end the dominance of the two clubs that season but back then @entity1 versus @entity2 was still the fixture to watch			1
it was a @entity117 for the @entity5 , pitching a side from the nation 's capital against another from far outside , with all the cultural differences that brings ; and two clubs steeped in success			2
in @entity22 's latest autobiography , his index requires 20 separate page references for all mentions of @entity1 , such was their impact on his career			2
' which of us was the better team ? ' he asks at one point			0
' you could n't call it			0
we were like two heavyweights battering each other			0
' saturday 's bout might push cruiserweight , if you 're being generous ; an undercard contest when once it was the main event			0
@entity2 's players are looking to jump above @entity1 in the @entity5 table with three points on saturday @entity1 forward @entity34 , pictured celebrating against @entity36 , is set to start against @entity2			1

@entity1 are sixth in the @entity5 , @entity2 are *seventh*
the last time both sides were out of the top four heading in to this fixture was over *16* years *ago* in september 1998
the game is a battle for the @entity17 instead of a title *decider*
