by @entity1 reporter published : 12:33 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 13:15 est , 31 october 2013 a man suffered severe injuries to his leg after a base jumping accident in @entity6 , @entity7 earlier this week			1
the story has gone viral after the injured man , @entity9 , 43 , posted a video of himself reacting calmly in the moments after the accident			1
according to a post on the man ’s @entity15 page , the accident happened after several others in the group had already jumped			2
as he fell , he hit the rock wall several times before finally coming to a rest on a cliff 600 feet above @entity37			0
' i jumped , probably took a tad longer delay than i should have , i struck the cliff with my left foot and continued rag dolling down the cliff where i finally came to rest on a sloping ledge			1
i knew i was banged up but to my utter surprise my foot was flipped on its side looking very similar to a nalgene bottle with just a sliver of skin keeping it on			2
misjudged : @entity9 had just free fallen around 250 feet before his parachute opened the wrong way dashing him into the cliff where he ' rag dolled ' another 150 feet seconds from disaster : @entity9 said he used parachute settings he wasn ¿ t used to , jumped off a landing site that was brand new to him , and went a tiny bit lower than he should have my first thought was , i want to wiggle my toes , because this is the last time i will ever feel that sensation ' there on a ledge where he came to rest , @entity9 pointed the video camera to his stump of a leg , and amidst painful expletives said : ' i think i lost my leg on that one ; ' then he apologized to his mom , and said ' not cool			1
' fortunately for mr @entity9 , one of the men in his group was an emt			1
it took around 45 minutes for search and rescue crews to reach him and airlift him to hospital			2
' i lost nearly three pints of blood and was very close to leaving this world by the time the helicopter got me to the hospital			0
on the extremely graphic video posted to @entity82 , @entity9 remains surprisingly calm throughout the video , casually panning back and forth between his face and his mangled leg			1
he also repeatedly says he believes he ’ll lose his leg			2
composed : viewers have been surprised how calm @entity9 remained in the minutes after the accident in base jumping , typically the jumper only has a few seconds to pull the parachute chord to prevent impact			1
on this occasion @entity9 said he used parachute settings he was n’t used to , jumped off a landing site that was brand new to him , and went a tiny bit lower than he should have			1
' if you take one of those equations out of it , i would have been fine , but with all … of those it gave me a problem , ' he said			0
according to his @entity15 post , which contains a graphic image of the mangled limb , mr @entity9 said the leg has been saved for now , but he said the possibility of infection means he could still lose the leg			1
at the hospital , over a period of two days , doctors performed four reconstructive surgeries and got his leg re-attached			1
' the doctors said that it was a miracle that they saved the leg , ' mr @entity9 makes it clear that he is well aware of the risks of his sport			1
risky business : @entity9 has had several major accidents while both climbing and @entity125 jumping ' base jumping is a very hard activity to explain to those who have never experienced the sensation and freedom of leaping off a cliff			1
just like rock climbing it 's something that you have to be very passionate about to except the risks that come with the amazing feeling you get while following your dreams			0
i was absolutely prepared to wake up the next morning , minus a foot			2
i joked about going full pirate mode with a peg leg but knew it could be a reality and was very sad about it			2
somehow , they saved it			0
i 'm not completely in the clear at this moment , due to possible infection ... but , i survived			0
so , the question is ; do we stand up and take the risks and have a blast enjoying our passions in life ? or , do we hide in the shadows , being afraid of what might happen if we are so bold to follow our dreams ? ' @entity9 ’s expecting another two weeks in the hospital if all goes well , and then a further six to nine months before he can walk again			1
he ’s hoping within a year ’s time , he can get back at it , he said , although , ' it ’ll never be the same again			0
' sorry mom : @entity161 's apologizes to his mother for taking the risks that caused the tragic accident			0
' that did go too well , ' he says in the video recovering : despite the horrific nature of @entity9 's injury , doctors were able to reattach the foot and there is a 70 per cent chance he will recover well enough to be able to use it again @entity9 has had several major accidents while both climbing and base jumping			1
one of them occurred on a big wall - climbing route in @entity180 – one of his favorite places in the world , he said ; that injury took months to recover from			0
he also took an 80 - foot fall climbing @entity185 in @entity186			0
he shattered his tibia last year in a base jumping accident ; and he was injured after @entity125 jumping off a building in @entity190			0
aware of the risks of his activities , @entity9 said that the benefits greatly outweigh them			1
' in those moments everything in life just makes sense , ' he said			0
most people on this earth are looking for those moments , @entity9 said			2
his activities bring him serenity			0
they do not bring him much of an adrenaline rush , he said , as most people wrongly assume			0
instead of adrenaline , he said he finds a focused meditation			0
' it ’s something that is very very hard to explain , it ’s a very personal thing , it ’s hard to put into words why i do it			0

@entity7 man nearly snapped off his lower leg and foot during *botched* base jump
@entity9 , 43 , suffered injury after parachute did not fully deploy
remained *remarkably* calm as he sat on a ledge waiting for rescue
doctors reasonably *confident* leg and foot can be saved
