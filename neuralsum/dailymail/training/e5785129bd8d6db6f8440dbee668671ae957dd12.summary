former @entity1 ace @entity0 and @entity3 captain @entity2 led @entity4 in their final training session ahead of the @entity8 opener against @entity9 in @entity10			1
rejuvenating an ageing squad has been @entity4 coach @entity13 's primary focus since taking charge but his greatest asset remains his oldest player , @entity0			1
the @entity18 attacking midfielder stands out in a crowd of relative unknowns on the international stage and his influence on the squad and their results is undoubted			0
@entity4 captain @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 stretch out as the @entity26 hosts prepare for their opener @entity0 , at 35 , remains @entity4 's most dangerous player having scored seven of their 11 goals in 2014 ( from left ) former serie a star @entity32 , @entity0 and @entity2 are the old heads for the @entity4 @entity0 scored seven of the 11 goals @entity4 managed in 2014 , including two at the @entity38 in @entity39 where they won many admirers despite losing group matches to @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
the 76 - cap veteran also delivered a goal of the year contender with his incredible left - footed volley in the 3 - 2 defeat by the @entity51 which took his tally in @entity53 to five - the same total as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
a buoyant figure within the camp , @entity0 was often laughing during their session on thursday and says he 's enjoying his football as much as ever ahead of what is likely to be his international swansong			1
it 's also the second favourites ' best chance of claiming their first major tournament triumph having been beaten by @entity69 in extra-time in the final four years ago			0
this is a big tournament and i really want to do well in it			0
i still love the game			0
i love it the same way i did when i first started playing at @entity77 as a 16 - year - old , ' @entity0 told the @entity80 's @entity79			2
@entity3 will miss @entity2 ( no 15 ) as the @entity4 captain leads his country on home turf @entity85 's @entity84 ( front ) will be another danger man for the @entity87 , along with @entity0 @entity3 and @entity87 captain @entity2 is the only @entity4 plying his trade as a regular starter in one of @entity93 's top leagues , with @entity95 's newly signed 42 - year - old keeper @entity94 retired from internationals			1
@entity32 , the former @entity97 journeyman now playing in @entity98 , is just one year @entity0 's junior and a frontrunner to be deployed as one of two no 10 's behind a lone striker alongside @entity103 ( @entity104 ) , @entity105 ( @entity106 ) or @entity107 ( @entity108 )			2
@entity13 's line - up will be an attacking one prepared to be frustrated by a defensive - minded @entity9 side that will sit back and look to catch their more fancied opponents on the break			2
other weapons at the former @entity118 manager 's disposal include @entity84 , who is on the books at @entity85 but is goalless this season in six appearances , mostly off the bench , and powerful @entity123 from @entity124 2 's @entity125			0
@entity4 players prepare to kick off the @entity8 in @entity10 on friday against @entity9 coach @entity13 ( 3rd from right ) leads the final run on @entity130 on thursday @entity0 's laughing now but stresses the importance of the tournament for football in @entity4 is massive @entity135 's @entity134 is @entity13 's preferred keeper , edging out @entity136 who 's played seven times this campaign for @entity139 , behind a possible back four of @entity140 ( @entity141 ) , @entity142 ( @entity143 , @entity144 ) , @entity145 ( @entity146 ) and @entity147 , who 's signed to @entity149 's @entity148 but back at @entity10 on loan			1
in a tough pool that also includes third favourites for the tournament @entity144 and @entity154 , @entity0 's ability to manufacture a goal from very little will be a key for the hosts			1
and the front man will be doing all he can to leave a lasting mark on the game in his home country where football battles rugby league , @entity166 and rugby union for attention			0
' if you ca n't understand just how important this tournament is now , then you 'll never get it , ' he said			0
' you see how well @entity69 and @entity144 have progressed , @entity174 also with the way they performed at the @entity38			2

@entity4 play @entity9 in the @entity8 opener on friday
@entity180 also includes @entity144 and @entity154
veterans @entity0 and @entity2 will be keys figures for the hosts
