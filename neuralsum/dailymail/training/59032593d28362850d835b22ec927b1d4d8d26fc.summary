scans of @entity1 the iceman have already given unprecedented insights into how our ancestors lived , but the latest find could be one of the most significant			2
not only have researchers discovered the 5,300 - year - old mummy suffered from atherosclerosis - narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits - they have found he may have been genetically predisposed to the condition			1
this is significant because evidence of genetic tendencies are notoriously difficult to obtain due to the degradation of remains			2
following a whole - genome study of the iceman ( pictured ) researchers discovered he had an increased genetic risk for coronary heart disease ( @entity26 )			1
in particular , the iceman 's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( @entity30 ) that have been linked with modern - day cardiovascular disease in more recent studies the find also highlights that despite lifestyles becoming more sedentary since @entity1 was alive , genetic predisposition and risk for the condition today appears to be very similar to that in ancient times			1
atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty substances known as plaques or atheroma			0
the plaques cause affected arteries to harden and narrow , which can be dangerous as restricted blood flow can damage organs and stop them functioning properly			0
if a plaque ruptures , it can cause a blood clot			0
this can block the blood supply to the heart , triggering a heart attack , or it can block the blood supply to the brain , triggering a stroke			2
source : @entity61 the research was carried out by professor @entity63 from the @entity64 at the @entity65 of @entity66 in @entity67			1
following a whole - genome study of the @entity71 iceman , a glacier mummy from the @entity73 , the researchers discovered he was at increased risk of coronary heart disease			1
in particular , the iceman 's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( @entity30 ) that have been linked with modern - day cardiovascular disease in more recent studies			1
this is of particular interest because ct scans of @entity1 have already revealed major blockages in several major blood vessels , including the carotid arteries , distal aorta , and right iliac artery			0
this is of particular interest because computed tomography ( @entity91 ) scans of @entity1 ( pictured ) have already revealed major calcification in several major blood vessels , including the carotid arteries , distal aorta , and right iliac artery			0
all of which are strong signs of generalised atherosclerotic disease @entity1 ( pictured ) was unearthed in september 1991 by @entity100 tourists trekking through the @entity101 , after which he was named			2
his perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the @entity105 in @entity67 at a constant temperature of -6 ° c the authors added that modern traditional cardiac risk factors - such as being overweight , smoking , lack of physical activity , and a high fat diet - can generally be ruled out in a person from this era			1
in particular , the genetic sequencing data demonstrates that @entity1 had a very specific genetic mutation - namely that he was homozygous for the minor allele ( @entity118 ) of rs10757274 , located in chromosomal region 9p21			1
this is currently seen as being among the strongest genetic predictors of heart attacks , and has been confirmed in several studies as a major risk factor for heart disease			1
the 5,300 - year - old ice mummy , known as @entity1 , suffered from the world 's first - known case of @entity130 - a bacterial parasite spread by ticks , according to dna analysis			2
analysis also revealed @entity1 was 5ft 2 inches ( 1.5 metres ) tall , had brown eyes , had relatives in @entity137 , and was lactose intolerant			0
he was unearthed in september 1991 by @entity100 tourists trekking through the @entity101 , after which he was named			0
he was believed to have been around 46 years old when he died			0
the iceman has been crucial to the understanding of how prehistoric people lived , what they wore and even what they ate			2
the iceman 's tattoos ( pictured ) which are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear - and - tear , lead archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture , which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress for example , researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat			1
archaeologists believe @entity1 , who was carrying a bow , a quiver of arrows and a copper axe , may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe			0
a hole in his collarbone suggested he was killed by an arrow , then a brain scan concluded he died from a fall			0
but research from the @entity65 of @entity66 / @entity66 ( @entity173 ) in @entity100 more recently discovered he suffered brain damage likely caused by a blow to the head			0
researchers also believe he was arthritic and infested with whipworm , an intestinal parasite			0
the iceman 's tattoos , which are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear - and - tear , lead archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture , which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress			1
his perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the @entity105 in @entity67 at a constant temperature of -6 ° @entity188 can view the mummy through a small window			2
alongside his remains is a new @entity1 model created using 3d images of the corpse and forensic technology by two @entity197 artists – @entity198 and @entity199			0
‘ our ancestors going back thousands of years show signs of atherosclerosis , ’ said the researchers			0
archaeologists believe @entity1 ( reconstruction pictured ) who was carrying a bow , a quiver of arrows and a copper axe when he died ‘ even though our human ancestors lived far different lives than we do , their environments and lifestyles were not protecting them against the development of atherosclerosis			0
’ they added : ‘ what is similar between now and then is the human genetic material , our genome , were uncovered to predispose the carrier to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease			1
‘ however , our ancient ancestors were certainly susceptible to many other conditions , such as infectious diseases , nutritional deprivation , and trauma			0
' [ these ] often resulted in death at an early age , before atherosclerotic heart disease had a clinical impact			1
’ future genetic studies of ancient humans have the potential to provide more insights into the presence and possible changes of genetic risk factors in our ancestors			1
‘ the study of ancient humans and a better understanding of the interaction between environmental and genetic influences on the development of heart diseases may lead to a more effective prevention and treatment of the most common cause of death in the modern world , ’ concluded the researchers .			1

the study was carried out by the @entity64 , @entity67
researchers conducted a whole - genome study of the @entity71 iceman
they found he had an increased genetic risk for coronary heart disease
in particular , the iceman 's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms ( @entity30 )
these @entity30 have been linked with modern - day cardiovascular disease
