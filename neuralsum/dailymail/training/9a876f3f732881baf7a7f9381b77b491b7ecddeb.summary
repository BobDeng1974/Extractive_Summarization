it seems increasingly likely that @entity1 will play a major and far - reaching part in @entity4 ’s title campaign this season			1
the game against @entity7 looked won when he was introduced on saturday , yet it was still @entity1 ’s interception that started the move for the third goal , putting the contest beyond reach			1
as every positive contribution he makes must feel like a dagger at @entity16 , @entity13 has been driven to defend his sale			0
‘ @entity31 and @entity32 are the next 10 years of the club			0
the project is to prepare for 10 years , not next year			0
' @entity35 is a striker , coming to help and support the strikers			0
@entity37 is the best defender in @entity38 , so it does n’t matter how old he is			0
a big player like @entity1 would stop the development of the other guys			2
’ @entity1 has proved useful at @entity4 , both on the pitch and in helping young players develop the former @entity38 midfielder was again involved in a @entity4 goal this weekend , once the game was won this makes no sense			1
for a start , @entity32 is 26 , while @entity31 will be 28 in may — they are not going to do 10 years in the first team at @entity23			2
equally , @entity1 , used exactly as he is at @entity4 , as an impact substitute and occasional starter in a system of rotation , would not have harmed development in the least			1
indeed , as everybody at @entity4 can not stop talking about his professionalism and worth as a role model to the youth and academy players , quite the opposite .			2

@entity1 was *influential* off the bench again this weekend
the former @entity23 star has proved an important @entity4 signing
as part of a rotation system he would have helped @entity23 's title push
