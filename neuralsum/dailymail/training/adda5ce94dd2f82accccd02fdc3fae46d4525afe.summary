after being introduced by mutual friends last year , the pair have remained tight - lipped about the nature of their relationship			2

miss @entity2 is a model , actress and singer who regularly appears on @entity21 television			1

when asked if the golfer was her type she replied : ‘ i do n’t really have a type , to be honest with you			2
