by @entity0 last updated at 4:26 pm on 31st october 2011 checking out : @entity1 spent over 10 years at the @entity2 in @entity3 a 79 - year - old woman has finally checked out of her hotel suite , after staying in the same room for over a decade			1
@entity1 first stayed in @entity7 at @entity8 by @entity2 , in @entity3 , @entity9 , on august 4 , 2001 and only moved out last week			1
the former pilot from @entity11 lost her husband , @entity12 , to cancer 10 years ago and soon afterwards was offered a job at the @entity15 and jumped at the opportunity			1
mrs @entity1 , who spent most of her married life in @entity18 , @entity19 , negotiated a deal which meant that she was paying $ 139 ( £ 87 ) a night for the 500 sq ft , two - bedroom suite			1
her reasoning was simple : that figure was not too much more than most of the flats available for rent in the @entity27 metro area $ 1,700 ( roughly £ 1,060 a month )			1
the extra cost was justified because in addition to freshly washed sheets , a daily cleaned room and continental breakfast , she was also provided with around - the - clock security and free @entity34 and cable television access			1
and , after checking out last wednesday , she succeeded in becoming the longest extended - stay guest in the hotel chain 's history			1
the 79 - year - old has outstayed six managers at the hotel september 2001 : the @entity42 in @entity43 and the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity9 , are attacked , killing almost 3,000 people ( including 19 hijackers ) october 2001 : @entity48 declares war on @entity50 and sends troops to @entity52 march 2003 : @entity48 and @entity53 declare war on @entity55 , believing leader @entity56 has weapons of mass destruction december 2004 : an undersea earthquake resulted in a massive tsunami striking southeast @entity61 killing approximately 230,000 december 2006 : former @entity55 leader @entity56 is hung after being found guilty for war crimes june 2009 : the ' @entity64 ' @entity64 is found dead at his home aged 50 january 2010 : at least 230,000 are killed in @entity66 after an earthquake on january 12 , 2010 and three million people are displaced december 2010 : the @entity69 is ignited in @entity70			1
by the end of october 2011 three regimes - in @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity73 - had been overthown may 2011 : @entity50 leader @entity75 is killed by @entity48 secret service men in @entity77 october 2011 : colonel @entity78 is killed in @entity79 , @entity81 's little surprise that she has become a @entity83 member of the @entity85 frequent guest loyalty program			1
mrs @entity1 began her professional career late in life - when she was 50			2
years of political organising helped her strike up a friendship with @entity90 and @entity91 which led to her first job during @entity94 's administration at the @entity95 in 1981			2
an appointment at the @entity97 followed , where she began work for the campaign ' a @entity100 ' in 1986			2
after moving in to @entity7 mrs @entity1 quickly became a part of the hotel community , and has outstayed six managers , and has developed firm opinions about how the hotel should be run			1
but the only piece of furniture she introduced to the room was an old armchair			2
in addition , there were only some plants , computer equipment , books and photo albums to move out of the room			2
she made friends with staff and neighbours , and recently her @entity121 friend who lived next door to @entity7 brought round traditional meals of spiced stew for them to share			2
' it 's helped my appetite , ' she told @entity128			0
' i call it community planning			0
i turned it into a community			0
' i would give a million dollars to manage a property like this for one year			0
' no matter where we look , there ’s always ways to save a few more pennies			0
' her daughter , @entity140 , added of her mother : ' she turned them into family , and they accepted			0
' now suffering from osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis , mrs @entity1 will move in with her daughter in @entity43 and she intends to use her energies in the church			0
she said : ' if i 've set a goal , i 'm going to reach it			0
' and she said that her goal now is to ' continue offering whatever i am able to give ' and added : ' i have to help			0
i 'm not a sitter			0
' but mrs @entity140 warned her mother with a smile : ' there ’s no continental breakfast at the @entity159			0
