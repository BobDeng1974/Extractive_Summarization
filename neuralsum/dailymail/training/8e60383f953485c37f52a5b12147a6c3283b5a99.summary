it will be less warm in southern @entity108 , but still around @entity109 ( @entity110 )			2
the pleasant conditions caused by high pressure are expected to continue into next week , with no significant drop in temperatures until next weekend			1

it ’s our job to make sure everybody gets water and the environment is protected			0
it ’s been a very , very dry week and river levels are continuing to decrease			0
‘ obviously , it ’s nice to have a sunny weekend but what we really need at the moment is a prolonged period of rainfall			0

if we all can use a little less , we can make the most of what we have			0
