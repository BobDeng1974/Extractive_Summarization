for some people , even the mere thought of running a race is enough to make them shiver			0
but one daredevil was literally left quaking in his boots after subjecting himself to one of the most physically demanding challenges known to man - the annual @entity7			0
@entity8 , a 28 - year - old adventure and travel photographer from @entity11 , was initially unable to celebrate coming in third place in the race in @entity14 , because he was suffering from severe hypothermia			1
@entity7 is among the extreme assault courses offered in the @entity17 to test people to their limits the race features an array of obstacles to over come amid treacherous conditions - hot and cold , mud and even electric shocks			1
the website for the extreme assault course explains : ' tough @entity7 is a window of opportunity to test oneself , on every discipline in life , in one day			0
' in footage shot at the event , @entity8 can seen paddling through freezing waters			1
' after the under water tunnel i lost all sense of time ' , @entity8 slurs afterwards			1
' i did n't really know what was going on			0
' as his body temperature plummets , the participant is unable to speak properly and lacked coordination			1
in the clip from the upcoming documentary , 28 - year - old @entity8 can be seen taking part he is immediately thrown into a warm shower to recover after people rush to help him and remove his ice cold clothing since he is pretty much incapable			1
at the end of the clip , @entity8 is standing over a fire and holds a blanket around him to keep the heat in			2
he is questioned by the cameraman as to why he was motivated to take up such a ludicrous challenge - ' will you tell me why you run this ? ' @entity8 , who has completed five winter @entity7 races and seven summer ones , struggles to answer : ' uh ... i do n't really know any more			1
' this year 's race was won by by @entity64 from @entity65 , who is videoed helping @entity8 into a hot shower after the event			1
speaking exclusively to @entity68 , @entity8 says that it is hard to describe how it feels to know you 're become increasingly hypothermic and still want to carry on and race			2
' any normal sane person would take the first chance to get into the warm and raise their body temperature back to normal , but when you 're racing you have to deal with the knowledge it 's going to get a lot , lot worse before it gets any better			0
' i go into pretty heavy shut - down but i know that whatever happens , if i keep dragging myself forwards i 'll make it to the end , and just hope i can do it quickly enough to finish well			0
it 's a bit of a never surrender attitude , and it does work			0
he also admits that this is not the first time he has subjected himself to hypothermia , although that did not put him off doing it all over again			2
' when i won in 2009 i spent four hours in an aid station afterwards , but i think this year i may have been worse than that - fortunately i had people looking out for me at the finish this time round			0
at times @entity8 is suffering so much from hypothermia that he can barely walk and sways from side to side there is panic in the voices of the two men supporting @entity8 as they realise how cold he is ' i do @entity7 mostly for the competitive side - i want to go back each year to race the event and do as well as i can			1
' that said , i also find it gives you a " reset " where you start the year with a challenge , the pride of completing it , and then the memory of the physical and mental destruction to compare the rest of your year too - it makes everything else seem much tamer ! ' @entity8 is used to putting himself through challenges and feats of endurance , from running from coast - to - coast across @entity17 , to wilderness hikes in the @entity125 or climbing erupting volcanos in winter			2
the competitor comes third but barely has time to celebrate before race winner @entity64 rushes him to have a hot shower even after the hot shower and standing by an open fire , @entity8 ca n't stop physically shaking his friends and family are supportive however , he reassures , ' though for the most part it 's something they would never do themselves			1
' the one person i wish was still around to show all of this to would be my maternal grandfather - he was an incredible mountaineer who climbed in the @entity139 with @entity140 , and a huge inspiration to how i want my life to be			0
' i like to this he 'd have been proud of my racing achievements within this sport			0
' what advice would @entity8 give to somebody entering one of those races ? ' get your clothing right and practice the feeling of sudden cold water in safety			1
i choose to wear lighter layers because i want to be fast , but in reality the safest thing is to rely on neoprene and merino wool layers			0
' he explains that its important for racers to know how it feels to suddenly drop into cold water so that they do n't panic on the day			2
' you can do this at home in your shower or in a safely shallow outdoor lake , ' he advises			0
' but have someone standing by the first time in case it really shocks you , and never jump into deep water - always somewhere you can stand up if it gets too much			2
