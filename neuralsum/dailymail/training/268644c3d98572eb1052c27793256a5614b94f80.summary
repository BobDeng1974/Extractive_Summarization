in most families , dinner table conversation is restricted to what happened at school or whether homework has been completed			2
but @entity5 asked his eight - year - old daughter how she would cure cancer , and it seems she may have got it right			1
@entity10 suggested using antibiotics , ‘ like when i have a sore throat ’			1
her parents , a husband - wife cancer research team were sceptical at first but tested out her theory in their @entity18 lab. and to their surprise , several cheap and widely - used antibiotics killed the most dangerous cancer cells			2
one antibiotic , doxycycline , is widely used to treat acne and is thought to be particularly promising			1
it costs as little as 6p a day			0
in contrast , some of the latest cancer drugs cost several hundred pounds a day			0
cancer charities said the research shows that the answers to some of the biggest questions are right in front of our eyes			0
professor @entity5 and his wife , @entity54 , were discussing their research over dinner one evening when they decided to ask their daughter for her opinion			1
the professor said : ‘ she has heard us talk about cancer a lot and we thought it would be fun to ask her what she thought about cancer therapy			0
‘ we asked her how she would cure cancer and she said “ @entity69 and @entity70 , i would just use an antibiotic , like when i have a sore throat			1
’ rather than completely dismissing the answer , the professor did a @entity74 experiment , rubbing an antibiotic cream on a small growth on his face			1
when the growth disappeared , he did some reading that confirmed that @entity29 may have been on to something			1
seven of the most common cancers , such as breast , prostate ( pictured ) , and hard - to - treat brain tumours , were slowed by the drugs which stopped them producing mitochondria which they use to reproduce unknown to @entity29 , a bubbly bilingual child who wants to be a teacher , some antibiotics stop cell from making mitochondria , the tiny engine rooms that supply them with energy			1
@entity29 ’s parents showed that cancer stem cells – the deadly ‘ mother cells ’ that give birth to tumours , keep them alive and ease their spread around the body – have particularly high numbers of mitochondria			1
they also showed that four common antibiotics killed these stem cells in samples taken from breast , prostate , lung , ovarian , pancreatic , skin and brain cancers			1
importantly , healthy cells were not harmed			0
the experiments on cells in a dish suggest that antibiotics could be used to stop cancer in its tracks and prevent it from spreading through the body – the main way it kills			2
professor @entity5 says that antibiotics could prove to be an inexpensive and safe one - size - fits - all treatment for cancer			1
he now needs funding to test his theory on people , including women with breast cancer			0
researchers say the results are promising and mr @entity5 is now seeking funding to try the treatment on humans ( file image ) if they are shown to fight the disease , they could potentially also be used to prevent the cancer in those at high risk of developing it			1
several previous studies support @entity29 ’s idea			2
this includes one in which lung cancer patients lived longer after being given an antibiotic to treat an infection they had			2
some 75 per cent lived for at least a year – up from the usual 45 per cent			0
in another study , tumours completely disappeared after just three weeks of taking doxycycline for an infection			0
@entity154 cautioned that professor @entity5 ’s work was done in the lab and does n’t tell us whether antibiotics will work on people with cancer			1
but @entity161 , which helped fund the research , is much more optimistic dr @entity163 , the charity ’s senior research officer , said : ‘ the conclusions the researchers have drawn , while just hypotheses at this stage , are certainly interesting			2
‘ antibiotics are cheap and readily available and if in time the link between their use and the eradication of cancer stem cells can be proved , this work may be the first step towards a new avenue for cancer treatment			2
‘ this is a perfect example of why it is so important to continue to invest in scientific research			0
‘ sometimes there are answers to some of the biggest questions right in front of us			0
but without ongoing commitment to the search for these answers , we ’d never find them			0
’ @entity29 ’s parents have acknowledged her contribution to their research by naming her as an author of their study , which is published in the journal @entity198			2
her father said the story emphasises the importance of listening to what your children say			0
professor @entity5 said : ‘ i thought it was very naïve to think you could cure cancer with antibiotics but at the end of the day @entity29 was right			1
‘ she usually is right about things			0
she always has a snappy answer that makes sense			0
‘ i think she will become a diplomat or a lawyer , someone who has to think on their feet			0

@entity5 asked daughter @entity29 how she would treat cancers
replied that she would use antibiotic ' like when i have a sore throat '
discovered antibiotics such as those in acne cream were *effective*
helped fight seven common cancers by limiting *ability* to reproduce
