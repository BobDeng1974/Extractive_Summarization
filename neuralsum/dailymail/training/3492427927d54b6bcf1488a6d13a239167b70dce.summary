by @entity0 for @entity1 fresh - faced and delicate , @entity2 , from @entity3 in @entity4 , might be barely 15 years old but to many in the @entity7 gypsy community , she 's a catch			1
originally from @entity9 , she is just one of the estimated 250,000 @entity7 gypsies to relocate to the @entity11 from @entity12 over the last decade			1
but with the influx of people has come their traditions - including the custom of marrying off girls and boys once they reach the age of 13			1
luckily , her grandmother says no luckily for @entity2 , that wo n't be her fate			2
' today girls and boys are equal , ' insists her grandmother			1
' if she marries at 15 and has many children , she wo n’t have a life			2
' i ’m in love with @entity7 culture , we have beautiful traditions			1
but the early marriage custom is no good			0
it needs to be changed			0
' not every gypsy thinks this way however , and @entity2 's older sister was herself married off aged 14 to a man in @entity9 two years ago			1
while the legal age for marriage in @entity9 is 16 , the authorities often turn a blind eye			1
under the traditional @entity46 code , families must pay a bride price for the girls - often of up to £ 5,000			1
but with many unable to afford so much , girls can change hands for as little as £ 3,000			1
either way , in the @entity11 , youthful marriage often brings unwanted attention from the police			1
one man to fall prey to the authorities ' crackdown on gypsy marriage in the @entity11 is @entity60 , an unemployed father of two who lives in @entity62 in @entity63			1
too young : under the @entity46 code , girls and boys are married off when they hit puberty - sometimes at 13 not happening : @entity2 's mother ( left ) and grandmother ( right ) want her to go to school rather than marry @entity60 , who moved to the @entity11 a year ago , is yet to find a steady job , or indeed , claim benefits as so far , the local council has turned down his application			1
' there 's no job , nothing , ' he complains			0
' what can we do ? if i steal , there ’s food , if not there ’s nothing			0
if we go stealing , the police arrest us			2
' incongruously , he adds : ' the wise never work			0
' with @entity60 and his family live his nephew , 23 , his wife @entity89 , 14 , and his 27 - year - old niece @entity90 , who was married off herself at 13 and , in consequence , has never been to school			1
' i do n’t know how to read and to write , ' she reveals			0
' i ’m 27 and without school , without work , without anything			2
' i got married when i was 13			1
since i was 13 , i 've had to look after myself			2
begging around people for £ 1 , £ 2 ... for one euro to buy food and stuff to live			2
' not , however , that has put her off marrying young as is traditional under the traditional @entity102 , which is known as @entity46			1
' when you 're 11 or 12 , when you 're married you get responsibilities , ' she continues			1
' you have to make a responsibility , you 're working			0
you have to make your own life , make your own house , make your own child			0
you have to grow them up			0
that 's when you get married			2
' the police , however , take a dim view of this approach and have paid frequent visits to @entity60 's home in search of 14 - year - old @entity89			2
different ideas : @entity120 @entity7 gypsy @entity60 lives with his nephew , 23 , and his 14 - year - old pregnant wife not good : despite lying to the police , the girl is eventually taken into care - as are his own two daughters @entity89 , who is in an illegal gypsy marriage with @entity60 's nephew , came to the attention of social workers after being seen by a gp			1
were social workers to discover the truth about @entity89 's marital status , that could cause problems for @entity90 and @entity60 and as a result , they lie to the police whenever they visit			2
' we lied because we did n't want to tell the truth , ' says @entity90			0
' it 's because she 's fourteen , she 's pregnant			0
' she has a husband here			0
she left her mum in @entity143			0
she lives here but we said to them she does n’t live here			0
it 's because if they find her they 'll take her			0
' take her , they eventually do - much to the horror of @entity60 and @entity89 's mother @entity153			0
' he had my daughter taken into care , ' she fumes , blaming @entity60 for what happened			0
' i will cut his nose off , i will take his eyes out			0
i regret with all my heart that i had to come here			0
' nevertheless , she too is happy to see her daughter married to a much older man			2
' i got married at 13 and had a baby at 15 , ' she explains			1
' these are our rules			0
' @entity60 , @entity90 , @entity89 and @entity2 appear on the @entity167 , tonight at 10pm on @entity168			1
