not so long ago , jams , pickles and sauces were simply stored in the kitchen cupboard			1
no one ever seemed to get ill , despite jars of marmalade , mustard and ketchup remaining at room temperature for months on end			2
these days , the very same products come with clear instructions to refrigerate them immediately after opening			1
times have changed : ketchup has less salt than in the past instructions : after opening , refrigerate and eat within eight weeks			1
dr @entity31 says : ' no one kept tomato ketchup in the fridge a decade ago , but then it contained more salt			1
in recent years , food manufacturers have had to cut the amount of salt , a natural preservative , because of its links to high blood pressure			2
' sodium benzoate , a preservative that used to feature in some brands of ketchup , has also been dropped by manufacturers because of its links to hyperactivity in children			2
' the vinegar and tomatoes in ketchup give it a high level of acidity , which slows down bacterial growth			2
' however , while ketchup could keep safely in the cupboard for a couple of weeks , it 's best kept in the fridge and eaten within the stated eight - week period			2
instructions : once opened , keep in the fridge and use within six weeks			2
dr @entity31 says : ' the acidity of vinegar preserves pickles and chutneys by inhibiting the growth of bacteria			1
however , this pickle seems to take a belt - and - braces approach to preservation by using two different vinegars , lemon juice and salt - even the apple is preserved before it is added			2
' the instructions to refrigerate and use within six weeks are unnecessary in my opinion			1
' pickle should be fine at cool , but ambient , temperatures for six weeks , and probably longer , especially if you use the squeezy bottle version , which minimises the potential for contamination			2
' refrigeration is n't necessary , but if chilled it could last for up to 12 weeks			0
' verdict : store in the cupboard			1
jam is safe at room temperature for six months after opening instructions : refrigerate after opening			1
dr @entity31 says : ' thanks to their fruit content , jams and marmalades are naturally acidic			1
this helps to inhibit the growth of any bacteria that might cause a mild stomach upset or allergic reaction			0
' @entity119 are more resistant to acidity , however , which is why fungi sometimes grow on opened jam			0
' normally jam does not need chilling if it is consumed within three to six months			0
however , always use clean utensils to remove jam from the pot. ' dirty knives or spoons can spark mould growth - which , even if removed , can diffuse into the jam beneath , leading to stomach upsets or , in some cases , an allergic reaction			0
' verdict : room temperature , but eat within six months			1
instructions : best - before date but no storage instructions			0
dr @entity31 says : ' @entity139 often contains potassium sorbate preservative , which inhibits yeasts and moulds from forming and ruining the product			1
' it also contains lactic acid , which stops bacterial growth			0
for an item like this not to have a recommendation to use within a few months of opening seems a little careless , however			1
' once it has been opened , over time micro-organisms such as @entity154 bacteria , which can cause a mild upset stomach , or even an allergic reaction , will grow			0
' i would be happy to use this within three months of opening if it had been kept in a cupboard - six months with refrigeration			1
always use a clean utensil to remove jam and peanut butter from jars to prevent contamination instructions : store at room temperature			0
dr @entity31 says : ' this spread contains largely natural ingredients - peanuts , oil , sugar and salt			1
' as it 's not packed with preservatives , the peanut butter could start to degrade , ruining the product and risking tummy upsets			0
' this is unlikely to be a cause for concern if it is used within three months of opening			1
' it does not need refrigeration - but , as with jams and other spreads , always use a clean utensil to remove the peanut butter from the jar to avoid contamination			0
verdict : room temperature , but eat within three months			2
instructions : refrigerate after opening and use within three months			1
dr @entity31 says : ' this is made from simple ingredients - water , mustard flour , sugar , salt , wheat flour and spices			1
some citric acid , a natural preservative , has been added to hinder bacterial growth			0
' the storage advice is sensible , and as mustard is often eaten with meat it is important to always use a clean serving utensil			0
dipping into the jar with cutlery covered in meat juices could lead to bacterial growth in the mustard and , in the worst cases , food poisoning			0
instructions : keep refrigerated for three months after opening - do not freeze			2
dr @entity31 says : ' the long list of ingredients , in particular eggs and cream , indicate it would never be sensible to store this at room temperature			1
' @entity232 , in the form of lemon juice , has been added to slow bacterial growth , but eggs and cream can spoil quickly and cause severe problems if they become infected			0
' the maker 's instructions should be adhered too strictly			0
instructions : store in a cool , dark place - it does n't have to be refrigerated			0
dr @entity31 says : ' just three ingredients here - vinegar , red pepper and salt			1
the only preservatives are vinegar and salt , which are adequate			0
' i would err on the side of caution and use this within eight weeks if unrefrigerated , or within six months if kept in the fridge , because , over time , some bacteria can tolerate and grow in acidic and salty conditions			0
' the label says the colour can change with no impact on the sauce , but this means chemical changes are occurring , so the sauce is not the same as when it was opened , even though it may be safe to consume			0
' verdict : refrigerate .			1

in the past , most condiments were stored in cupboards
but they now come with *warnings* to refrigerate immediately after opening
is it overzealous health and safety ?
