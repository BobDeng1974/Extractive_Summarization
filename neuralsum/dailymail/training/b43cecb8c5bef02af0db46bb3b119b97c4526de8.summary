it is one of the most adnaved surveillance systems ever created - and could already be flying above you			2
researchers have revealed a plane - mounted camera system called @entity5 that can survey a 25 square mile patch of a city for up to six hours			1
it allows police to zoom in to crimes , and even ' rewind ' the video to see them being instigated			1
the @entity5 system kits out planes with an array of high - resolution cameras			1
the cameras are angled to capture the largest area , and can capture a 25 - square - mile patch of @entity30 constantly for up to six hours			1
they fly at around 10,000 feet			2
footage is beamed back to a police control room , where officer can zoom in , and even rewind the footage			1
the system was developed by @entity37 , a retired @entity38 veteran who owns a company called @entity40			2
@entity37 told the @entity41 his product as ' a live version of @entity44 , only with @entity46 capabilities			0
' the firm kits out planes with an array of high - resolution cameras that allow a pilot to record a 25 - square - mile patch of @entity30 constantly — for up to six hours			1
the planes fly at around 10,000 feet			2
the @entity40 system has been tested in cities including @entity56 and @entity57 , and last year police officers in @entity59 used it to track crimes , including a necklace snatching			1
in one case , they could track a criminal as he approached a woman , grabbed her jewelry , and then ran to a getaway car			0
the plane used in @entity59 : live footage was beamed back to operators operators in a police control room are able to zoom and even rewind to footage is they spot a crime in progress ' we literally watched all of @entity59 during the time that we were flying , so we could zoom in anywhere within the city of @entity59 and follow cars and see people , ” @entity37 said			1
' our goal was to basically jump to where reported crimes occurred and see what information we could generate that would help investigators solve the crimes			2
' the firm boasts it has worked with forces across the @entity92 to develop the system			0
' @entity40 has assisted law enforcement organizations throughout the @entity92 with over 30 murder investigations since 2007			0
' the hawkeye system and image analysis have directly led to the apprehension of violent offenders			0
' the system is also relatively cheap , and @entity40 says each unit cost less than a fully equipped police helicopter - but can cover 10,000 times the area			1
the firm behind the @entity5 system says officers have used imagery to : 1			0
backtrack murder suspects to their homes / places of origin 2			0

identify exactly what time and location a suspect or accomplice drove by a ground - based security camera			1
dissect entire criminal networks in 3 - 4 days .			0

system being *trialled* in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity59
allows police to see crimes alive - and rewind to see those committed in the past
uses plane kitted out with high resolution cameras that can fly for six hours at a time
