by @entity1 reporter @entity3 stalwarts @entity4 and @entity5 are cautiously optimistic of emerging from a ' wide open ' @entity7 group			1
the pair are among their country 's most experienced campaigners , sharing 136 caps and a combined 26 years of international football , but both are still searching for a first major tournament appearance			2
there are unlikely to be too many more chances , with @entity4 34 and @entity5 approaching his 30th birthday , and the one in front of them is as enticing as they have experienced			1
strong start : @entity3 midfielder @entity5 has called on his side to beat @entity23 confident : @entity3 - led by @entity24 - will be hoping to seal qualification for @entity7 there are no heavy - hitters in @entity28 - they start against @entity23 on sunday and also face @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31 - and the play - off on offer for the third - placed side seems an achievable aim			1
@entity4 and @entity5 have been around long enough to temper any undue enthusiasm with a shot of realism , but spirits remained high as they touched down in @entity40			1
' i think we can do it , but all the other teams will be saying the exact same thing , ' said @entity4			2
' in our @entity49 group a lot of people would have said @entity50 and @entity51 will be the top two and the rest are fighting for order but it 's very hard to predict this one			2
' @entity56 are consistent and know what it takes to get through but everyone else on any given night can beat each other			2
' that throws the group wide open and we have to be confident we can do it			1
' @entity64 captain @entity5 echoed those sentiments , sensing a real chance to take @entity3 back to the big stage for the first time since the 1986 @entity49			1
high ambitions : @entity5 wants to see @entity3 qualify for the next @entity70 ' you 've got to be confident going in , ' said the midfielder			1
' it 's going to be tough but with the extra teams going through this time it 's got to be the best chance we 've had for a long time			2
' it 's important we get off to a good start in the group			2
the other teams will be thinking of that as well , especially @entity56 , given that they were in the @entity49 but they are n't , with respect , a @entity84 or a @entity85			0
' but you do n't get to the @entity49 knockout stages without being a good side , so everyone expects them to qualify from the group			1
there is second and a play - off place up for grabs though			0
' this campaign is going to be big for everyone			0
i want to contribute and have a successful campaign but it 's down to improving results on the pitch			0
' two of @entity3 's biggest frustrations in recent years have been their poor form on the road and @entity5 's disappointing goals record - just one goal in 46 caps			1
a result against @entity23 would quickly turn around the first of those issues , but @entity5 warned his own search for a second goal may be one of the sacrifices along the way			1
@entity116 objective : @entity117 defender @entity4 is optimistic his side can progress to the next round ' of course you want to score more goals , but if you take away @entity122 then you could probably say it 's a problem for most of us in the camp			1
' it 's a different responsibility at international level away from home			0
a lot of times away from home with @entity3 we 're under a lot of pressure , but we often defend really well and that can impact on us in an attacking sense			1
' if getting a result means more defending i 'll take it			0
it really does n't matter who scores though , even if ( goalkeeper ) @entity143 smacks one in			0
' for @entity4 , this is the second qualifying campaign since he reversed his retirement			0
it is widely assumed it will also be his last but having called it a day once and changed his mind he is no longer willing to predict his future			0
' that question is always going to be around when you 're at the age i 'm at , especially after making the u-turn a couple of years ago , but regardless of whether this was my second campaign or my last this is as good a chance as we 've had in a long time			0
' i 'm taking each game as it comes now and not looking past sunday			0
' look at the guy in the @entity49 ( 43 - year - old @entity165 goalkeeper @entity164 ) , it 's always possible			0

@entity5 believes @entity3 have been placed in an open group
@entity24 is optimistic his side can seal @entity7 qualification
@entity3 take on the likes of @entity23 and @entity29 in @entity28
