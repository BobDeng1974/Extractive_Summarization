this november , mother - of - two @entity0 and her husband , @entity2 , are planning a weekend away in @entity3 to celebrate 30 years of marriage			1
while for some @entity7 couples this would mean a romantic stroll along the @entity9 and a candle lit dinner for two , for @entity12 , and @entity2 , 50 , it will involve a visit to a @entity3 swingers club where anything goes			1
the couple , from @entity17 , @entity18 , have frequented such sexually liberated establishments for years - and @entity12 said it has done wonders for their marriage			1
open relationship : @entity12 and her husband @entity2 enjoy swinging in @entity3 she told the @entity24 of their sexcapades : ' our marriage has been enhanced greatly by fully enjoying our weekends away			1
' in the early days it was a great talking point between us - especially in the bedroom , where without embarrassment or fear of what either would think - we could relive moments we 'd enjoyed or moments we 'd like to enjoy in the future			2
mutual understanding : the couple have been married for nearly 30 years and do n't get jealous seeing their partner with someone else ' i suppose we looked upon it as a kind of hobby , people would go on gastronomic weekends , cultural weekends ( we did many of those also ) we just went on slightly more gratifying weekends			0
' while @entity12 said she and her husband always had a happy sex life , it was after a weekend to @entity3 when she was 29 and they had been married for seven years that they truly had a sexual awakening - after dabbling in sex shows and venues famed for swinging			1
since then she has had numerous sexual encounters with married men , women , a distinguished @entity65 diplomat and - what she rates among her favourite experiences - a team of @entity65 firefighters			1
as previously reported in the @entity24 , @entity12 has written about their sexual liberation in a self - published erotic memoir called @entity73 in @entity3			1
the book has been climbing up the best - sellers lists on @entity76 and @entity12 has been approached by publishers seeking to produce a hardback version			0
tell all : @entity12 said her sexual awakening began when she was 29 and she had since written a memoir of her sexcapades she is also working on a sequel that will bring readers up - to - date with the couples more recent experiences			1
when it comes to her dalliances with other men - and her husband 's with other women - @entity12 said there has never been any jealously or arguments			1
she said they went into situations with ' their eyes wide open ' and always with one another 's consent			0
she explained that at first they established ground rules of ' look but do n't touch ' but these quickly went out the window when they realised how much seeing their partner with someone else turned them on			0
@entity12 writes in her book how this unfolded for the first time when they were approached by another couple in a @entity65 club			0
she writes : ' the atmosphere was electric ... and soon a very attractive couple came and stood beside us , very quickly it became apparent that they fancied having some fun with us , right there and then			0
@entity118 : @entity12 said she and her husband enjoy knowing other people are attracted to them ( posed by models ) ' she started to run her hand up and down my thigh and whispered something in my ear , i looked at @entity2 and he whispered " what about our ground rules ? " i grinned and said " i 'm about to break them ... just a tiny bit ? " a look of pure ecstasy instantly crossed his face , and in a blur i found myself being gently kissed by her partner			1
' @entity12 explained to the @entity24 that ' jealousy was never an issue ' between her and @entity2 , with whom she two grown up children			0
she said : ' i feel this is because we had married so young and had grown up and grown into the marriage together and there was never really a his and hers agenda , we simply did things together as one unit			0
' speaking of that first encounter that led to many more , she said : ' i enjoyed seeing other attractive women sexually attracted to @entity2 , safe in the knowledge that he was mine			2
' it was a boost to both our ego 's that after seven years of marriage , we were both still attracted to and desired by others			1
in the elegant club environment of @entity3 , it was the perfect situation to let go of any inhibitions and to act out your wildest fantasies and fulfill any desires you might wish at the time			2
it was all available and possible			0
' explicit : the writer said her book is an honest account of her experiences @entity12 said that her double life over the years - juggling being a mother at home and a swinger in @entity3 - has added frisson to her sexual encounters and marriage			1
she said : ' the fact it 's on foreign soil gave us a sense of bravado as the chance of bumping into anyone you may have had an inappropriate moment with on the monday morning back in @entity184 was minute to say the least			2
' also we adore the elegance in which the @entity186 do things , it 's all had a little ' @entity188 '			0
they seem to have a different attitude to @entity7			0
' @entity12 admits her book is not ' for the faint - hearted ' but she insists every word is true and while some readers may not condone her behaviour , she hopes others may find it inspiring			2
she said : ' i do n't in any way class my book as pornography but pure and simple factual erotica written for today 's modern woman by a woman who is real and has lived it			2
' i hope it inspires women from wherever and whatever age you are , to embrace your sexuality , and explore fully the deep dark erotic side that we all have ( some hidden deeper than others )			0
