by @entity0 published : 20:09 est , 20 february 2014 @entity2 : 20:19 est , 20 february 2014 email alert : sir @entity4 urged officials three months ago to launch a series of investigations health bosses have been accused of trying to cover up high death rates and alarming waiting times in the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the medical director in @entity14 professor sir @entity4 urged officials three months ago to launch a series of investigations into six hospitals after being alerted to the figures by a @entity21 mp			1
he also pointed out that waiting times in @entity12 were ‘ persistently higher ’ than in @entity14 , with up to 80 per cent of patients waiting more than six weeks for key diagnostic tests for diseases such as cancer			1
however bosses did n’t reply to his email – nor did they launch any investigation			1
the revelation comes amid growing concern over the state of the @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity21 – which has been in power in @entity12 since devolution in 1999 – runs the country ’s @entity11 separately from the health service in @entity14			1
it has not ring - fenced the @entity11 budget as the @entity38 has done			1
instead spending on the @entity11 has been slashed by 11 per cent since 2011			2
there is now growing evidence that the financial cuts are having a knock - on effect on waiting times , in @entity44 and on the overall standards of care in hospitals			1
at one hospital , three nurses have been arrested amid claims of serious patient neglect			2
the @entity52 in @entity53 was already under the spotlight over the death of a patient who waited four hours in an ambulance before being admitted to @entity44			0
in his email , sent to his @entity21 counterpart dr @entity59 on november 28 last year , sir @entity4 pointed to figures showing that around 50 per cent of @entity21 patients wait at least six weeks for bowel cancer scans compared to around 1 to 2 per cent in @entity14			1
similarly for @entity66 scans – which are used to detect everything from cancer , dementia and muscular injuries – 48.6 per cent of patients wait six weeks or more compared to less than 1 per cent of @entity14 patients			2
and 80 per cent of patients were waiting 6 weeks or longer for urine tests which can be used to detect bladder cancer			0
sir @entity4 wrote : ‘ there are six hospitals with a persistently high mortality which warrant investigating			1
‘ i do not have adequate data to form a view			0
‘ waiting times in @entity44 are considerably worse than @entity14 , but the real concern is around prolonged ( longer than 6 weeks ) waiting times for diagnostics ( scans which include cancer tests ) including which , of course , translates to delayed treatment			1
’ last night @entity88 said the situation was ‘ deeply disturbing ’ and accused the @entity90 of covering up the truth about the state of its hospitals			1
they likened the situation in @entity12 to other scandals such as @entity97 , which occurred when @entity21 was in power			2
the @entity52 in @entity53 was already under the spotlight over the death of a patient @entity102 , @entity103 mp for @entity104 said : ‘ this is an abominable indictment of @entity21 ’s attitude to the @entity11			1
‘ now , in the last corner of the country where @entity21 is still in charge of health , what do we see , but exactly the same efforts to protect political self - interest over patients ’ lives			2
‘ just like with @entity116 , we find all the effort focused not on investigating hospitals of concern , but an effort to discredit the data , potentially at the cost of peoples ’ lives			1
’ the six hospitals sir @entity4 said he was concerned about include the @entity52 , @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 in @entity129 , @entity130 near @entity131 , and three community hospitals			1
he was alerted by mp @entity133 , who in 2012 exposed how her husband died like a ‘ battery hen ’ in a @entity137 hospital			2
the @entity21 mp for @entity139 , said : ‘ the situation is deeply disturbing			0
i have been calling for an inquiry into death rates for some time because several of the figures are extremely worrying			0
‘ people in @entity12 ought to be able to have as good care as anywhere else , but instead here are people dying on hospital waiting lists , and suffering appalling failings in care			1
’ a @entity154 spokesman said : ‘ mortality rates in @entity12 are published on a quarterly basis and latest figures demonstrate clear improvement			1
if issues are identified , we work quickly to put them right and we do not hesitate to investigate as needed			0
‘ to suggest that the @entity11 is covering up high death rates is therefore utterly ridiculous and completely without foundation			1
’ concerns : former nurse @entity166 - @entity165 for years campaigners have been trying to get a proper investigation into claims of serious neglect at the @entity52 , @entity53			2
cases where patients have suffered ‘ prolonged , unnecessary suffering ’ haunt the families involved			2
three nurses have been arrested over falsifying patient records at the hospital after staff blew the whistle			0
bereaved relatives have sought help from the @entity181 , but many are calling for a full public inquiry			0
an independent review was ordered by the @entity21 government , prompted by the ‘ unacceptable ’ care of @entity187 , an 82 - year - old amputee who was admitted to the hospital four times before she died there in august 2012			1
her son @entity191 said : ‘ @entity187 was left @entity193 on one occasion for two days without assessment because it was a weekend and the assessment teams did n’t work on the weekends			2
it was nothing short of torture			0
’ doctors told mrs @entity187 ’s family she had pneumonia and that the hospital would withdraw support of all food , water and medication			0
she died four days later when the family insisted on a post-mortem examination			0
mr @entity191 said : ‘ there was no pneumonia			0
she died of a heart attack after days without nutrition and after days deprived of life - saving medications for her heart and diabetes			0
‘ it was the most cruel , prolonged , unnecessarily suffering death			0
’ former nurse @entity222 , who worked at the hospital for eight years before leaving in 2009 , says she raised several complaints about patient care but was ignored			0
she said she saw an infected room poorly cleaned before it was used by other patients , a dementia patient being roughly handled by a nurse and a nurse give the patient the wrong medication			0
an urgent review is under way following the death last month of a 58 - year - old man attended by paramedics in an ambulance outside the hospital for more than four hours before being admitted to the emergency department			0
a statement from @entity242 said : ‘ we apologise sincerely to the patients and families who we have let down at the @entity52			0
‘ in may 2013 we invited an external team – @entity246 – to review quality and safety at the hospital			0
this was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients ; critical ombudsman ’s reports ; mortality rates , and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses			0

professor sir @entity4 urged officials to launch investigations
he said waiting times in @entity12 were ‘ persistently higher ’ than in @entity14
however bosses did n’t reply to his email or launch any investigation
@entity276 comes amid growing concern over the state of the @entity11 in @entity12
