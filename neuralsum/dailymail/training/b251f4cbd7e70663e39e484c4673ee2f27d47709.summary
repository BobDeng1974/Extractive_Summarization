by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 08:26 est , 3 september 2013 @entity2 scientists have invented a flexible computer keyboard that is as thin as a piece of paper and can turn any area into a touch - sensitive surface			1
tech company @entity8 ( @entity8 ) claims its keyboard is the world 's thinnest , at half a millimeter thick and offers consumers a ' glimpse of future computing interfaces ' that are paper - thin , wireless and respond to touch			1
the device can be used to extend the touch - sensitive areas of tablets and smartphones so customers can use a full - size thin keyboard to type messages on their mobile			1
they claim it is the world 's thinnest it combines the company 's low - power wireless technology with cutting - edge printable and flexible electronics			1
@entity36 , director of @entity37 at @entity8 , said : ' the device can do basic text input as well as touch and gesture control , so you can swipe and pinch and zoom , as well as use much more complex gestures , ' that people now use many touch screen devices			2
' it can also be used with a stylus - type pen for handwriting recognition and to draw and sketch , ' he added			1
the device can be used to extend the touch - sensitive areas of tablets and smartphones so customers can use a full - size thin keyboard to type messages on their mobile the company said the keyboard can be integrated into a proprotective cover for a tablet , or used to create large touch zones on a desktop computer			1
it claims the device adds a ' full keyboard experience ' to a tablet without using up screen area like the pop - up keyboard that comes as part of most tablet software			0
the paper - thin surface is wirelessly connected using a new @entity78 chip that is optimised for this ' @entity80 ' technology			0
the keyboard combines the company 's low - power wireless technology with cutting - edge printable and flexible electronics			1
@entity36 , at @entity8 , said : ' the device can do basic text input as well as touch and gesture control , ' that people now use many touch screen devices this allows it to connect to the latest @entity94 smartphones and tablets as well as @entity96 , using much less power of standard bluetooth			2
touch latency is minimised to less than 12 milliseconds , ensuring almost instant visual feedback			0
mr @entity36 said : ' consumers want innovative , portable wireless accessories that just work with their mobile devices			0
' the company said the keyboard can be integrated into a protective cover for a tablet ( pictured ) or to create large touch zones on a desktop computer			0
it claims the device adds a ' full keyboard experience ' to a tablet without using up screen area like the pop - up keyboard that comes as part of most tablet software the technology is inkjet printed so it ' can be rapidly created in different formats and adapted to fit multiple sizes of tablets and smartphones available today , ' he said			2
the company partnered with @entity126 and @entity127 to make the thin surface			0
it uses @entity126 's touch silicon to sense multiple contact points on a surface and @entity127 's printed conductors for the flexible membrane			2
the reel - to - reel printing process enables copper and other conductors to be applied to the surface of the ultra-thin and flexible membrane , and can be printed to fit a range of tablet shapes and sizes			0
the keyboard will make its debut at @entity146 this friday			0
it can also be used with a stylus - type pen for handwriting recognition and to draw and sketch ( pictured )			1
