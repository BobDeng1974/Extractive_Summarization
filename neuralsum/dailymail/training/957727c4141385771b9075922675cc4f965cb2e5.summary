two giggling women have been filmed twerking on the @entity7 - in path of thundering trains and inches from a 600 - volt rail			1
police are investigating the video , in which a male friend can be heard laughing as the tattooed pair in black sweatshirts plead : ' no face ! no face ! '			1
one stuck out her tongue like @entity24 i 've been @entity26 on the railroad : the women perform in an apparently deserted subway station in @entity30 unsafe : the scene is thought to be on the 8th avenue line where trains run 24 hours a day on a live rail a @entity36 spokesman told the @entity37 the video is thought to have been shot on the @entity40 line , which carries subway routes a , @entity42 and @entity43 the three routes run 24 hours a day and trains are as often as every five minutes			1
they also use a 600 - volt live rail - which it appears can be seen in the video and has caused high - profile deaths recently			1
the shocking clip has been viewed more than 50,000 times in the day since it was uploaded to @entity53 , prompting outrage on the video sharing site			1
several users said the pair should ' win a @entity59 award ' for their supposed attempt to eliminate themselves from the gene pool			2
blurred lines : as well as calling the stunt unsafe , some viewers said the women were simply bad at twerking embarrassment : one of the women covers her face as her friend moves round to film her			2
police are investigating after fears the women could have been hit by regular trains or electrocuted themselves craze : @entity26 has gone global since @entity24 and @entity75 performed at the @entity77 awards others complained they were not very good at twerking			0
the rump - shaking craze has exploded since pop star @entity24 performed the energetic dance with @entity75 at the @entity77 awards earlier this year			2
videos have flooded the internet of twerkers performing in some curious places , including libraries , car bonnets , church and even - in one case - on the grave of the performer 's grandmother			0
the video has been passed to the @entity95 , who are investigating			2
one viewer on @entity53 suggested it could also have been shot at @entity100 station in the @entity101			0
it is on the d line , which also runs all night with trains as often as every six minutes			0
it comes after high - profile deaths involving the lethal live rail on @entity30 's subway over the summer			1
@entity109 , 30 , drunkenly urinated on the 600 - volt rail in @entity111 and was killed by the current passing through the stream			1
a friend who tried to help him was also injured			0
another man was fatally electrocuted two weeks later when he dropped his cellphone on the tracks in @entity119 and jumped down to find it			0
in february , @entity30 recorded nine subway injuries - three of which were fatal - over just six days			2
the third rail is used to power trains and usually carries a standard 625 volts			0
