@entity0 met with members of the @entity4 administration 's national security team on june 13 , despite his close ties with a @entity7 leader who advocates for the destruction of @entity9 and has been banned from the @entity10 since 1999 the @entity12 's @entity11 has confirmed that staffers held a june 13 meeting with @entity15 , an @entity16 cleric who shares leadership of the @entity18 , where he is vice-president and the terror supporter @entity21 is president			1
the meeting occurred on the same day the @entity4 administration announced plans to arm @entity26 's rebel factions , in the wake of a determination that president @entity29 had used chemical weapons against his own people			1
the @entity32 , which released a report late tuesday covering the circumstances of the meeting , wrote that @entity15 has referred to the @entity36 ' as " a mountain upon whose peak there is light ” and as " a great reformer " who " spreads knowledge and wisdom			2
" ' @entity46 saw a late draft of that report			2
' like many in the global @entity7 movement who pose as moderates to the press and to liberal intellectuals by issuing condemnations of @entity58 , ' it read in part , ' @entity49 refuses to label the acts of groups such as @entity62 , @entity63 or @entity64 as terrorism			0
' he has also issued ' an endorsement of the push by @entity7 intellectuals to criminalize blasphemy against the @entity7 prophet @entity73 and @entity74 , ' the group reported			0
' ' he also met with a number of experts , ' that claim continued , ' including the director of public relations in the @entity12 , the national security adviser , and representatives from seven government agencies			1
' @entity77 is special assistant to the president and @entity79 at the @entity11			2
@entity87 is the lawyer tapped to implement the ' new beginning with @entity102 around the world ' which president @entity4 promised during a june 4 , 2009 speech in @entity106 , @entity107			2
@entity49 cultivates an image as a @entity7 moderate despite his views			0
@entity21 , meanwhile , is a more vocal proponent of @entity7 suicide bombers killing @entity111 , especially in portions of @entity9 that @entity113 claim as their territory			1
@entity21 ( r ) , shown with @entity62 prime minister @entity115 ( @entity88 ) , leads the @entity18			2
his second - in - command , @entity80 , was welcomed into the @entity12 on june 13 @entity21 is generally considered the leading @entity74 scholar affiliated with the @entity7			1
he has called openly for the destruction of @entity9 and the deaths of all jews , called @entity121 a divine punishment for the ' misdeeds of the @entity111 ' and claimed the @entity124 has been popularly exaggerated			0
@entity21 has also said he wants to die ' in the service of jihad ' by blowing himself up in @entity9 and killing @entity111 in the process			1
' i have supported [ suicide bombings ] for the past 20 years , ' he said in 2008			0
' i do not automatically support martyrdom operations , ' he continued			0
“ i permit them under specific constraints , when necessary , like in the case of our @entity113 brothers who are forced to defend themselves by turning themselves into bombs			0
' the two clerics ' close association has caused reputational trouble for @entity15 among @entity141 governments , and the @entity142 has denied @entity21 entry into the country since 1999			2
but the @entity4 administration welcomed @entity15 into the @entity12			1
@entity49 's own views about @entity113 terror attacks on @entity9 targets may have made inviting him to @entity12 a difficult call			1
@entity4 has made overtures to the @entity9 lobby since the days of his first presidential candidacy , but members of his national security team met secretly with the vice president of a leading @entity157 group this month @entity158 , circled in red , is shown at the december 2012 @entity18 ' board meeting in @entity161 , @entity162			1
@entity21 is shown to his left ( camera - right )			0
the meeting ended with a call for the destruction of the state of @entity9 ' that the @entity170 would invite to the @entity10 a radical @entity7 cleric whose organization supports terrorism and whose leaders have issued fatwas calling for the killing of @entity10 and @entity111 is beyond comprehension. , ' @entity32 executive director @entity169 told @entity46			1
@entity169 called on @entity178 to investigate ' immediately			0
' ' in my 30 years of covering terrorism , i have never in my life been so appalled and outraged at what can only be called criminal behavior by this administration , ' he said			0
@entity11 communications director @entity185 told @entity46 in an email that she was ' unfamiliar with this meeting , ' but later allowed that she was ' not disputing it			1
' separately , a senior administration official confirmed to @entity46 that ' @entity77 and members of the @entity191 met with @entity192 to discuss a wide range of issues including poverty , global health efforts , and @entity49 ’s efforts to counter the @entity58 narrative			2
' ' ms. @entity77 stated that she looked forward to working with him , ' the official added , ' and with other faith leaders on issues of mutual interest			0
' @entity80 's @entity206 website initially reported that ' the national security adviser ' of the @entity10 , @entity208 , was a participant in the june 13 meeting after @entity46 inquired with the @entity12 , but before @entity15 's organization was approached , the ' national security adviser ' language disappeared @entity21 claimed in 2009 that the @entity124 was a ' divine punishment ' directed at @entity111			1
@entity80 , who met with @entity11 staff in the @entity12 , is @entity21 's deputy as vice president of the @entity18 , which @entity21 leads the account of the meeting on @entity15 's website also mentions that he ' called for the protection of the @entity26 people and the @entity7 minority in @entity223			1
' but less than 12 hours after @entity46 made inquiries with the @entity11 , that account was altered to remove any reference to national security adviser @entity208 having attended the meeting			1
the site still claims ' the director of public relations in the @entity12 ' - likely a reference to communications director @entity232 - did attend			0
there has been no confirmation from the @entity12 or from @entity15 that either @entity232 or @entity208 participated in the june 13 meeting			1
a second web page on @entity15 's site was also changed within hours of @entity46 's inquiries			1
according to translations provided by the @entity32 , an arabic language account of the june 13 meeting originally mentioned the ' director of public relations in the @entity12 ' and ' the @entity242			0
' it was changed to refer to ' deputy director of @entity245 in the @entity12 ' and ' deputy national security adviser			1
' the @entity11 would not confirm the attendance of any specific @entity249 deputy			0
@entity87 , @entity10 envoy to the @entity92 , is the @entity4 administration official tasked with rebooting @entity10 's relationships in the @entity7 world during an april 2013 tv interview , prominent @entity18 member @entity253 wished openly of @entity256 's @entity111 that ' @entity121 had finished them off , thus relieving humanity of them ' any connection with the @entity18 could be problematic for the @entity4 administration , since that organization ended its december 2012 board meeting by calling for all of @entity9 to be returned to @entity113 , and for the return of those @entity113 who were exiled after the @entity264 in 1948			1
its most prominent members have also expressed openly anti-semitic views			0
@entity270 @entity74 scholar @entity269 , for instance , said in april on @entity271 that @entity111 ' are cowards ' and ' the most miserly of all peoples ... if only @entity121 had finished them off , thus relieving humanity of them			0
' and @entity62 parliament member @entity274 , another @entity18 member , claimed on the @entity62 - run @entity276 that ' jews are behind each and every catastrophe on the face of the @entity281			0
this is not open to debate			0
... any catastrophe on the face of this @entity281 , the @entity111 must be behind it			0
' that assessment came on sept. 12 , 2012 , as the @entity10 @entity288 in @entity289 , @entity287 lay in ruins and ashes			2
the @entity292 did not respond to a request for information about whether it recommended against issuing a visa to @entity15 for his june 13 meeting			2
typically , a former @entity292 official told @entity46 , that agency would have been consulted before the @entity142 began the process to clear him for entry into the country			2
speaking of the @entity18 , the @entity32 's @entity169 claimed ' the @entity303 has just legitimized a group that is basically no different that @entity62 or @entity63 , except that this group is the one issuing the religious edicts to those @entity74 terrorist groups to carry out jihad against @entity9 and the @entity10			1
' ' this is the equivalent of inviting @entity58 to the @entity12			0

the @entity311 and @entity10 have banned @entity21 , who leads the @entity312 .
the @entity4 administration invited that group 's *vp* , @entity80 , to a private meeting on the day it announced support for @entity26 's rebels
the organization ended its december 2012 board meeting by calling for the end of @entity9 and the return of its lands to the @entity113
hours after @entity46 began inquiring with the @entity11 about its meeting with @entity15 , the cleric 's website was edited to remove the claim that national security adviser @entity208 attended
