@entity0 appears to have done a u-turn by claiming he wants @entity2 to stay at @entity3 - providing his injury problems and wage demands can be managed			1
@entity3 co-owner @entity6 had previously said that the mercurial midfielder was not wanted by the manager , telling @entity9 : ' @entity0 has said @entity2 is not part of his plans but we as a board see him as part of our plans			1
' @entity0 now seems to support the club 's view after insisting the 21 - year - old still has a role to play , especially if he recovers from the hernia problems that plagued him last season			1
u-turn : @entity2 is wanted at @entity3 , provided he gets over injury problems and does n't demand too much money @entity26 spark : the @entity28 under 21 midfielder started well at @entity3 before joining @entity29 on loan ' he 's contracted to @entity3 , ' @entity0 told reporters			1
' i think he 's had a hernia op. once that 's healed up i hope he becomes a better player because he has been playing with it for a while			2
the groins have been causing him a problem for a while			0
' if you 've got pain , i do n't think you perform to your best			0
hopefully that pain will have ended and he 'll be a much freer , more active player for us			0
if he could do what he did last season , that would be great because , when he broke in to the side early last year , he had a great spell			2
unfortunately he could n't sustain it			0
' on the mend : @entity2 has undergone successful surgery on groin injury during pre-seaon u-turn ? @entity6 had previously said that @entity2 was n't in @entity0 's ( above ) plans the @entity28 under 21 player made a bright start to his career at @entity58 before fading out and spending the latter half of the season on loan to @entity29			1
@entity0 is willing to give the talented youngster another chance , but added that @entity2 's wage demands would influence his future at the east @entity67 club			2
' if he continues to do what he did last season then yes [ we want to keep him ] but that does depend on how much players want , how much they demand			0
if that demand is far too great then that becomes a difficulty for us			0
