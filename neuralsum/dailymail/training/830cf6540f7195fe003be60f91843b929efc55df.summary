it 's a stunt that would terrify most men - having a live snake in their trousers			1
but this man did it just to get a few laughs from his fellow participants on a jungle survival skills expedition in @entity9			1
video of the stunt shows the man casually walking away from the camera and unzipping his trousers as he prepares to relieve himself			2
he then finishes with a bit of a shake , before turning around to face the camera			0
as he does so a boa constrictor can be seen poking out of the front of his zipper			0
the snake then proceeds to slither out			0
according to the camera man , the stuntman had several years experience handling dangerous and poisonous animals in the region , and performed the trick simply to lighten the mood			2
according to the @entity30 he said : ' the presence of a boa constrictor at your side will help you urinate better and will also prevent small rodents from entering your clothing			0
' slithering stunt : the man turned around to reveal a boa constrictor escaping from his trousers just taking a leak : the man was seen casually walking off to find a quiet spot to relieve himself escape route : the boa constrictor then slithered right out of the man 's pants and on to the ground below that 's a wrap : the snake then slithered away as the man casually stood there like nothing had happened			1

the stuntman was on a jungle survival skills expedition in @entity9
when he *thought* he *'d* lighten the mood by *putting* a snake in his pants
after relieving himself the snake slithered out of the man 's trousers
