@entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 united in condemnation of the @entity5 's decision to move the @entity8 club 's final game of the @entity9 season back 24 hours			1
in a move designed to accommodate broadcasters , @entity2 will face champions @entity1 at @entity13 on may 3 — 24 hours after @entity0 and promotion rivals @entity15 and @entity17 play			1
adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for @entity25 's side , @entity19 chief executive @entity18 and @entity1 chairwoman @entity20 have lodged formal complaints with the league			1
in a staggering misjudgment of the public mood , however , the @entity5 issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before @entity2 boss @entity25 compounded their woe by revealing he also backed @entity0 ' stance			1
@entity0 are upset that @entity2 ' final game of the season has been pushed back for tv purposes ramping up the pressure on @entity5 chief executive @entity40 , @entity0 counterpart @entity18 said : ' in previous seasons , the @entity41 has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time			1
' i have been in contact with the @entity5 following its announcement that one final - round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known			1
' i have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them			0
' on a day when the relationship between broadcasters and @entity60 football came under unprecedented scrutiny , @entity1 majority shareholder @entity56 backed up her city rivals			1
in a statement , @entity56 also queried the ' sporting integrity ' of @entity2 playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with @entity0 for second place			1
' this has been done following selection of the game for a live tv broadcast , ' she said			1
' while we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change , we did not for one minute think that at this late stage , it would be moved to the sunday , especially given our belief that all @entity9 games would require to be played at the same time			1
' on learning of the change , i immediately attempted to contact the @entity5 and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity			0
@entity2 will play @entity1 at @entity13 in their final game of the season on may 3 ' being given 17 days ' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans , the sponsors and indeed the club			1
overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel ; others have advised of lost earnings , holiday problems , etc. ' none of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club , i can only apologise			0
' when it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved , we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly , this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the championship			2
' while it may not be enshrined in the newly - merged rulebook of the @entity5 , it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the championship to be played simultaneously			2
' to move only one , ( or even two or four ) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations			2
' i will be sending in a formal complaint to the @entity5 in relation to this appallingly late decision			0
it is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded , especially at such short notice			0
' i am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless , i want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and i will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the @entity41			0
' responding to the criticism , however , the @entity5 rushed out a statement saying it was ' unreasonable ' to expect all @entity9 games to kick off simultaneously			0
' in response to recent criticisms of the @entity9 fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 may , we 'd like to clarify some specific points			0
on this weekend , the @entity1 v @entity2 match is scheduled for sunday 3 may to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise			1
this is a key game in the @entity9 season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world			2
hearts are already promoted from the @entity9 , but they too condemned the fixture change ' it is unreasonable to expect all @entity9 fixtures that weekend to move to the sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the @entity1 v @entity2 tie			1
however , as a result of this fixture , all @entity9 clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the sunday			0
' to date , we have had no request from @entity0 to move its fixture to the sunday at the time of writing ( 8.45pm , wednesday 15 april )			1
' we also note speculation that @entity183 expressed concern to the @entity5 about the scheduling of the @entity1 v @entity2 match			1
however , @entity183 confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all @entity9 fixtures that weekend			2
' whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures , the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 may are in no way unusual			2
' after his side drew with @entity198 last night , however , @entity8 manager @entity25 gave his view , saying : ' first and foremost , we 've not asked for the game to be changed			1
hibs are complaining about it and rightly so			0
i 'd be doing exactly the same			0
i think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time			1
' but we 've told by the tv , i believe , that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the sunday			2
i honestly do n't know			0
it 's nothing to do with us			0
we 've not asked for that , but if i was in @entity0 ' position then , yes , i would be annoyed as well			2
' i was happy to play on the saturday			2
we 've not tried to gain any advantage - we 've been told when to play			0
@entity206 controls a lot of things			0
if the game definitely has to go ahead on the sunday then can we all then move to the sunday			0
i 'd be happy with that			0
i would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time			1
it would be only right			0

@entity2 ' final game of the season against @entity1 pushed back 24 hours
@entity8 side will face @entity1 on may 3 at @entity13 to accommodate tv
