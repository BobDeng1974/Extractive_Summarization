professor @entity0 believes the future of the human race depends on our abilities to explore space			1
during a tour of @entity9 's @entity8 , the 73 - year - old said that landing on the moon gave us new perspectives of life on @entity13 , and this outlook must develop if we are to survive			1
he also said aggression should be weeded out of the human race and replaced by empathy to avoid a major nuclear war ending civilisation as we know it			1
professor @entity0 ( file photo shown ) was speaking at @entity9 's @entity8			1
he said space travel is vital to the future of the human race			1
and he also said aggression should be replaced by empathy			0
' a major nuclear war would be the end of civilisation , and maybe the end of the human race , ' he said professor @entity0 made the comments while escorting an @entity30 visitor around the museum as part of a ' @entity34 ' prize			1
@entity35 , 24 , from @entity36 , @entity37 , won the tour after producing a blog and video describing a ' perfect day ' in the @entity43 capital			0
she asked professor @entity0 what human shortcomings he would alter , and which virtues he would enhance if this was possible			1
he replied : ' the human failing i would most like to correct is aggression			0
it may have had survival advantage in caveman days , to get more food , territory or partner with whom to reproduce , but now it threatens to destroy us all			0
in november , @entity57 , the entrepreneur behind @entity58 and @entity59 , warned that the risk of ' something seriously dangerous happening ' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence , could be in as few as five years			2
he has previously linked the development of autonomous , thinking machines , to ' summoning the demon '			0
speaking at @entity69 's @entity68 in october , @entity57 described artificial intelligence as our ' biggest existential threat '			1
he said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			2
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that			2
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			2
' i 'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n't do something very foolish			0
' with artificial intelligence we 're summoning the demon			2
you know those stories where there 's the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and â€¦ he 's sure he can control the demon ? does n't work out			0
' ' a major nuclear war would be the end of civilisation , and maybe the end of the human race			1
' the quality i would most like to magnify is empathy			0
it brings us together in a peaceful , loving state			0
' the professor added that human space exploration was ' life insurance ' for the human race and must continue			1
' sending humans to the moon changed the future of the human race in ways that we do n't yet understand , ' he said			2
' it has n't solved any of our immediate problems on @entity13 , but it has given us new perspectives on them and caused us to look both outward and inward			0
' i believe that the long term future of the human race must be space and that it represents an important life insurance for our future survival , as it could prevent the disappearance of humanity by colonising other planets			1
' ms @entity35 , a teacher and creative writer , who beat more than 10,000 international contestants to win the prize , said : ' it 's incredible to think that decades from now , when my grandchildren are learning @entity0 's theories in science class , i 'll be able to tell them i had a personal meeting with him and heard his views first hand			0
it 's something i 'll never forget			0
' the @entity34 competition was organised by @entity134			0
in december 2014 , professor @entity0 issued another warning - that artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			1
speaking at event in @entity9 , the physicist told the @entity142 that : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			1
' the professor added that human space exploration was ' life insurance ' for the human race and must continue			1
' sending humans to the moon changed the future of the human race in ways that we do n't yet understand , ' he said			2
shown is an illustration of @entity158 's @entity157 spacecraft and in january , a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity57 and professor @entity0 , signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity164 research benefits humanity			1
the letter warned that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			0
the document , drafted by the @entity170 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			0
and the authors said there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity164 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society .			0

professor @entity0 was speaking at @entity9 's @entity8
he said space travel is vital to the future and survival of the human race
and he believes aggression should be replaced by empathy to avoid war
the 73 - year - old warned a major nuclear war would ' be the end of civilisation , and maybe the end of the human race '
it follows previous comments in which he also listed artificial intelligence as an existential threat
