the new @entity1 unity government held a cabinet meeting in the war - battered @entity3 for the first time today , marking the end of more than seven years of absolute @entity8 control of the coastal territory			1
in establishing a @entity3 foothold , the cabinet also tried to assure the international community that foreign aid for @entity3 's reconstruction will not reach the militant group @entity8 , which is shunned by the @entity16 as a terror group			1
the meeting came three days before an international pledging conference in @entity20 where @entity16 - backed @entity1 president @entity21 is to seek $ 4 billion for @entity3 reconstruction after the recent 50 - day war between @entity24 and @entity8			1
it is made up of independent experts , none of whom are declared members of the two main @entity1 movements , @entity8 and @entity54			1
@entity8 has said it would allow the ministers , who report to @entity21 , to operate freely in @entity3			1
however , @entity8 has refused to disband its security forces , creating a potentially volatile situation			0
today prime minister @entity26 and 11 ministers arrived in @entity3 from the @entity64 , joining five colleagues who were already present in @entity3			0
after entering @entity3 through an @entity24 - controlled crossing , the ministers toured the town of @entity30 and the @entity70 neighborhood of @entity71 , both badly damaged during the war			1
@entity8 security forces formed cordons , linking arms , as curious and unruly crowds thronged the ministers			0
later , as the visitors drove through @entity80 in a convoy , hundreds of people lined the street to watch , some waving and a few holding the yellow flags of @entity54			1
the cabinet convened in @entity21 ' former residence in @entity70			0

' i cried in @entity30 when i saw how the people live and sleep			0
the priority is reconstruction and political unification			0
' @entity8 officials today said the organisation would be supportive of the cabinet			2
' this unity government was the result of a reconciliation agreement that @entity8 worked hard for , ' said @entity110 , a senior @entity8 official in @entity111 , @entity112 's capital			1
' therefore , we have a real and serious interest in enabling it ( the new government ) to work successfully in @entity3			0
' after the meeting , the ministers visited the top @entity8 official , @entity118 , in a show of good will			2

residents gather on a hill to see prime minister @entity26 , who visited the @entity3 with his cabinet today @entity118 had served as prime minister for both the @entity64 and @entity3 after @entity8 won parliamentary elections in 2006			2
he was fired by @entity21 a year later , after @entity8 seized @entity3 by force			2
the takeover triggered a border blockade of @entity3 by neighboring @entity24 and @entity138 , and over the years , repeated reconciliation attempts failed			0
@entity8 became increasingly unable to govern after new @entity138 border restrictions last year drove its worst financial crisis since its founding in 1987			0
earlier this year , a desperate @entity8 agreed to hand over some authority in @entity3 to an @entity21 - led unity government			1
the new government was formed four months ago to replace rival administrations - one led by @entity8 in @entity3 and the other headed by @entity21 in autonomous areas of the @entity64			1
however , it had n't been operating in @entity3 until now because of unresolved disputes between the long - time rivals and because of the war			0
@entity1 unity is a consensus issue , with polls consistently showing a majority in favor of ending the political split			2
in @entity3 , many hope the new government will be able to ease border restrictions and revive the crippled economy			0

@entity24 fears @entity8 will divert cement and steel for military use , including attack tunnels			0
@entity24 spotted and destroyed more than 30 such tunnels during the recent @entity3 war			0
under a @entity187 - brokered reconstruction deal , @entity24 is to ease the import of building materials , while @entity187 inspectors and forces loyal to @entity21 are to monitor the shipments until their final destination			1
