for a man obsessed with preparation and time - keeping , @entity0 and his team are developing a habit of leaving it all to the last minute			1
on saturday they relied on @entity7 to rescue them in the final seconds of their opening @entity10 fixture against @entity11 at the @entity12			1
on monday , after a chaotic mix - up involving the @entity15 airport authorities , @entity0 arrived in @entity16 for their @entity18 qualifier against @entity20 way behind schedule			1
he is demanding an improvement on tuesday evening			2
‘ we were not completely happy with our performance last saturday and we want to improve , ’ he said			2
‘ it is a big test			2
we have had a short preparation and we know that in one week we have three big games with @entity20 home and away and @entity44 in between			1
we have to be on our toes			2
’ @entity46 were sluggish on saturday , confronted by unusual circumstances after @entity48 decided to leave @entity11 just 48 hours before the season began			1
the bright spot was the performance of @entity52 and he will make his @entity18 bow alongside @entity53 in hostile surroundings			2
@entity0 believes he is ready			1
comeback kings : @entity46 pulled it back to claim all three points against @entity11 at the weekend good performance : @entity0 was pleased with the performance of @entity46 new boy @entity60 ( pictured ) ‘ he wo n’t play the full season as he is only 19 , but he had adapted very well , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ at the moment he is growing with every game and resisting the pressure			2
he ’s adapting to a new position			2
’ here in @entity16 , @entity46 are on familiar territory , accustomed to playing a @entity18 qualifier before the action starts for real in the group stages next month			1
they have made it for the past 16 years			0
‘ i have good experience of the @entity18 , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ i know you have to be pragmatic , but first we have to qualify			0
before we can speak about anything else we have to put in two big performances against @entity20			1
‘ i let people judge what i do			0
all i can do is my best every day and accept the verdict			0
i ’m in a public job so i accept it			0
‘ financially it is a big game , but it does n’t affect my transfer policy			0
we want to compete at the top level and to fight with the best in @entity86			0
that ’s the point of the competition			0
’ @entity0 ’s eyes always light up when he speaks of the @entity18 and last night , inside the @entity90 , was no different			1
he is obsessed with the idea of winning it			0
‘ every game we win makes us stronger and that will give us confidence , ’ added @entity0			1
to live with @entity20 , who beat @entity97 5 - 2 in the previous round , @entity46 will be forced to make changes following injuries to @entity101 and @entity102			1
both are nursing hamstring injuries and have been left behind			0
‘ @entity101 will be out for three to four weeks and @entity105 was n’t comfortable enough to travel , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity106 , who missed saturday ’s league opener at the @entity12 through illness , returns to the squad			0
big threat : @entity46 will have to keep former @entity112 striker @entity111 quiet if they are to progress it is a compelling tie , coming up against a manager who was once the coolest kid in town when he was managing @entity117			2
@entity119 ’s career as a coach has never quite hit the same heights , but he is a popular and combustible character on the touchline			0
they are no slouches and @entity111 , the striker acquired from @entity112 in the summer , scored a hat - trick in the second leg of their 3 - 1 victory over @entity97 here in @entity16			0
‘ we have a dream to make it all happen , ’ admitted @entity119			0
