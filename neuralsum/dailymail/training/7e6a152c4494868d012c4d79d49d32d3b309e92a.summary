by @entity0 published : 21:47 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 21:56 est , 1 august 2012 a freshman @entity2 representative said wednesday that august 1 , the day contraception coverage goes into effect , is one of the darkest days in modern @entity7 history , likening it to the attacks on @entity10 and the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
speaking at a press conference wednesday , rep @entity12 ( @entity14 ) said that @entity7 was under attack with the mandate , saying : ‘ i know in your mind you can think of times when @entity7 was attacked			1
one is december 7th , that ’s @entity10			1
the other is september 11th , and that ’s the day of the terrorist attack			1
’ he continued : ‘ i want you to remember august the 1st , 2012 , the attack on our religious freedom			2
that is a day that will live in infamy , along with those other dates			2
’ anger : rep. @entity12 spoke at the @entity35 wednesday at at @entity36 , likening the birth control mandate to @entity10 and 9/11 @entity38 , who is an outspoken supporter for the pro-life movement , made the apocalyptic comparison on @entity36 wednesday			1
@entity41 originally reported the @entity2 ’s angry reaction to the mandate going into effect			0
he also called it ‘ religious bigotry			1
’ rep @entity48 ( @entity49 ) agreed with his fellow @entity2 , caustically throwing out more thoughts against the @entity52 mandate			2
‘ we ’re not in the land of the free anymore , ’ he said , ‘ and we need to get that straight			0
’ a spokesperson to @entity38 ’s office did not immediately return @entity59 ’s request for comment			0
the issue of birth control has been a hot topic in @entity64 and across the country , with @entity66 and @entity2 often seeing dramatically different views			0
aside from the partisan debate , many @entity69 leaders in many different dioceses rallied against the @entity74 administration ’s health care reform			1
cardinal @entity75 of @entity76 wrote a letter to the president in february saying the law ‘ does not meet our standard of respecting the religious liberty and moral convictions of all stakeholders in the health coverage transition			1
the new law requires employers – including those in religious organisations – to provide health insurance plans that in turn offer free contraception to their workers , something that many religious leaders find contradictory to their beliefs			1
taking control : with the mandate going into law , non-exempt employers must provide insurance which in turn must provide birth control with no co-pays president @entity74 signed the historic heath care reform bill into law in march of 2010			1
@entity106 notes that @entity38 ’s fuming response to the bill ’s passing is not the only one from a @entity2 representative			0
' i know you can think of times when @entity7 was attacked			2
i want you to remember august the 1st , 2012 , the attack on our religious freedom			2
that is a day that will live in infamy			0
' earlier this summer , rep @entity121 ( @entity123 ) compared the @entity125 ’s decision to uphold the health care law to september 11 , according to several @entity128 sources			1
immediately after making the comment , @entity129 issued a statement saying : ‘ my remarks at the @entity133 following the @entity125 decision were thoughtless			0
i certainly did not intend to minimize any tragedy our nation has faced and i apologise			0
’ as of wednesday night , @entity38 had not offered an apology for his statements earlier in the day			2
those infuriated by his comments took to his @entity143 page			0
historic : president @entity74 , surrounded by lawmakers , is pictured on march 23 , 2010 , signing his signature healthcare insurance reform legislation look back in anger : many protestors took to @entity36 in protest of the @entity150 ; the @entity125 later voted to uphold it one user wrote : ‘ how embarrassing for our country			0
i think the congressmen ought to think carefully … then think again before he sprouts this fundamentalist garbage while wrapping himself in our flag			0
’ the freshman representative has already been blasted by @entity161 senator @entity160 , who is a veteran of @entity162 he wrote : ‘ i witnessed the attack on @entity10 and had the privilege of serving in the @entity165 during @entity162 and i find the comments made by the congressman from @entity168 to be misguided and insulting			1
‘ it is complete nonsense to suggest that a matter discussed , debated , and approved by the @entity172 and the president is akin to a surprise attack that killed nearly 2,500 people and launched our nation into the second @entity162 or a terrorist attack that left nearly 3,000 dead and led to fighting and dying in @entity180 and @entity181			0
