energy secretary @entity48 ( second left ) , @entity11 @entity85 secretary @entity49 and schools minister @entity54 mr @entity24 sat opposite @entity36 , who he accused on monday of playing ' footsie ' with @entity87 ahead of the election following the prime minister 's revelation that the @entity92 referendum could take place earlier than 2017			1

but they do n't plan to stay on the road , they want to stray far from it			0
they 're trying to sell you an ideological approach to cuts to public services packaged up as continuity			0
' it 's a con			0
it 's like a mobile phone salesman offering to renew your existing contract and then cutting the amount of calls you can make			1
