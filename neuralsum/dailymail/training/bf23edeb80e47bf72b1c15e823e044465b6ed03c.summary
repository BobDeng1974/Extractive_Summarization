a study from the @entity7 was recently released and shows that over half of public pools are swimming with fecal matter			1
after testing 161 public pools in the @entity13 , @entity14 area in the summer of 2012 , the study found that 58 percent contained genetic material from the @entity16			1
murky issue : the @entity7 says over 50 percent of public pools are likely contaminated with fecal matter it ’s a bacteria most people know as @entity16			1
and what does @entity16 mean ? you guessed it ! it means poo			1
the study , undertaken by the @entity7 ’s @entity28 , indicated that ‘ @entity16 , a fecal indicator , was detected in 93 ( 58 percent ) samples ; detection signifies that swimmers introduced fecal material into pool water			1
not only is your pool just a giant toilet , but it ’s all your fault and you might not even know you ’re doing it			0
@entity37 : the study of 161 public pools in @entity13 , @entity14 showed that 58 percent contained e. coli bacteria , a ' fecal indicator ' likely introduced by swimmers who do n't shower first the @entity7 wrote that ‘ formed fecal incidents , ’ as it calls them , are n’t the problem			1
instead , the e. coli is introduced from the nether regions of swimmers who neglect to shower before taking a dip			0
‘ the average person has about .14 grams of feces on their rear end , ’ @entity50 , who led the study , told @entity52			0
‘ if that rinses off into the water , the amount from one person might not be that much			0
but as more and more swimmers introduce it that much , it does become an issue			0
’ @entity50 all that introduced material can really pile up			0
‘ let ’s imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park			0
they have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends , ’ she said			0
‘ we are now talking about 10,000 grams or 10 kg. that translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water			0
’ and though all public pools must maintain specified levels of disinfectants in order to stem illnesses caused by such contamination , @entity50 said it may not always be enough			1
pile up : ' let 's imagine 1,000 kids go to a water park			0
they have as much as 10 grams of feces on their rear ends			0
that translates to 24 pounds of poop in the water , ' says the @entity7 's @entity50 ‘ chlorine and other disinfectants do n’t kill germs instantly , ’ said @entity50 said , adding that proper hygiene is the only to prevent the fecal contamination of pools			1
@entity50 says between 20 and 80 outbreaks of disease caused by swimming pools are reported each year			1
in addition to the ‘ fecal indicator ’ bacteria , many of the pools in the study also tested positive for @entity100 , a bacteria capable of giving swimmers rashes and ear infections			1
the study said it was unclear if the @entity105 came from people or if it was introduced to the pools from the surrounding environment			2
it was found in 59 percent of the tested pools			1
@entity50 does n’t want to dissuade anyone from swimming			2
she calls it an excellent form of exercise			0
one she even says she ’ll be doing as soon as the weather permits in @entity13			2
nonetheless , she took a hard line on the issue			0
‘ it is time to stop treating the swimming pool as a toilet , ’ @entity50 said			2
‘ nowhere else except for the pool is it acceptable to poop in public or pee in public			2
in other places if we did this in public , we ’d be arrested			2
’ steaming mad : ' it is time to stop treating the swimming pool as a toilet , ' says @entity7 's @entity50			1
