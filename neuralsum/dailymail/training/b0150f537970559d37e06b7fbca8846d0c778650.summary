the recreation of one of the most famous moments from the @entity3 by @entity4 's in its 2014 @entity6 advert was branded both ' cynical ' and ' wonderful ' today			1
@entity8 's third biggest supermarket said the commercial is a ' creative interpretation ' of christmas day 1914 when @entity8 and @entity12 soldiers laid down their weapons and met in @entity14			1
@entity4 's reconstructed the trenches scenes with the help of a war historian to celebrate the supermarket 's 20 years of support for the @entity20 , which runs the annual poppy campaign			1
while some called it moving and brilliant others were saying it was an ' exploitative ' way for a big business to advertise itself			0
the founders of clothing company @entity26 and @entity28 tweeted : ' how do you think my great great grandfather would feel knowing his bravery had been reduced to advertising @entity4 's ? ' @entity33 added her concerns , saying : ' if there 's anything more tasteless and cynical than the @entity4 's @entity6 advert , i 've yet to see it '			1
but @entity39 tweeted : ' the @entity4 's @entity6 advert is amazing , 10 times better than @entity41 ' and @entity42 wrote : ' just saw the @entity4 ’s @entity6 advert			1
that is definitely the best advert so far '			0
magic moment : a @entity8 and a @entity12 soldier meet in @entity14 on christmas day in the new @entity4 's advert unveiled last night main characters : with fears soldiers may shoot them , the two men risk their lives to climb out of the trenches and meet each other special : the story of the @entity12 and @entity8 soldiers enjoying a game of football during the @entity3 has been spoken about ever since the ad follows a @entity8 soldier as he hears enemy troops singing @entity61 in @entity12 and ventures into ' @entity14 ' before soldiers from both sides join him and shake hands			1
he shares a moment of friendship with a young @entity12 soldier and , as the truce ends and they return to their trenches , the @entity12 is moved to discover that his @entity8 friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket - linked the supermarket 's message of ' sharing ' at @entity6			1
shoppers can help to raise extra money for the @entity20 after @entity80 this year by buying the chocolate bar featured in the advert from @entity4 's stores , with the profits going to charity			1
the advert is @entity4 's attempt to take on the might of @entity41 , which has dominated the multi-million pound battle to win over @entity6 shoppers			1
@entity41 has this year concentrated on the heart - warming friendship between a little boy and a penguin and its rivals are spending millions of pounds trying to outdo			0
despite costing £ 95 the stuffed toy versions of the penguins in the advert sold out within hours online - but on @entity100 today some said that the new @entity4 's advert is as good , if not better			2
@entity102 said : ' sorry to the @entity103 but @ sainsburys have knocked the socks off the @entity107 competition ! ' beginning : the four minute advert feels more like a short film as a camera sweeps over the trenches on christmas night scene : the advert starts with soldiers singing @entity61 in their respective languages as snow falls on the trenches drama : the young @entity118 is deep in thought and then , to shouts of fear and anger from his comrades , decided to climb above ground spark : the men shaking hands leads to other troops also climbing out of the trenches to meet their foes greeting : the soldiers shake hands and even hug in the heartwarming advert released today and shown for the first time last night @entity136 weapons : @entity12 and @entity8 officers stand shoulder to shoulder in the brief moment of peace before they returned to fighting friends : the men try to communicate in their different languages and the @entity146 shows his @entity12 counterpart a picture of his love at home gift : the @entity12 is moved to discover that his @entity8 friend has hidden the gift of a chocolate bar in his pocket message : @entity4 's is using a similar sentiment used by @entity41 that @entity6 is about sharing and giving with less than seven weeks to go most of the @entity8 ’s consumer giants have already launched their annual festive advertising campaigns			1
and by now , we know what that means			0
between today and december 25 , television viewers will be subjected to a barrage of elaborate feel - good adverts			0
@entity167 shunned their previous formula of using celebrities , replacing them pair of do - gooding magic fairies			0
@entity173 ' advert is about a shy girl baking gingerbread and an exhausted nurse coming home after finishing her @entity6 shift is what @entity178 has concentrated on			2
the @entity4 's tribute advert follows the exhibition of thousands of ceramic poppies in the moat of the @entity184 to commemorate 100 years since the start of the @entity3 , which has drawn millions of visitors			1
@entity187 , director of fundraising for the @entity20 , said : ' we 're very proud of our 20 - year partnership with @entity4 's and this campaign is particularly important			2
' one hundred years on from the 1914 @entity6 truce , the campaign remembers the fallen , while helping to raise vital funds to support the future of living			2
' @entity195 , head of brand communications at @entity4 , said : ' this year , we wanted to reflect that theme of sharing in our @entity6 campaign through the lens of one of the most extraordinary moments of sharing in modern history when , on christmas day 1914 , @entity8 and @entity12 soldiers laid down their arms , and came together on neutral territory to share stories , mementoes and even a game of football			1
“ the @entity6 truce is an especially poignant story from @entity3 that has been recreated on a number of occasions and we know it resonates with many of our customers and colleagues			2
we ’ve partnered with @entity20 to ensure we tell this story with authenticity and respect and we hope it will help keep alive the memory of the fallen that made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their country			1
' it is also a way for us to mark the 20th anniversary of our partnership with @entity20 and to help us raise additional funds for them			0
' the letter of a @entity8 soldier to his family corroborate claims enemy forces enjoyed a game of football on christmas day , a historian who advised @entity4 's on its controversial advert has claimed			1
@entity240 said he was ' sceptical ' about helping the supermarket reconstruct scenes from the trenches for its festive commercial , fearing there was not enough evidence to prove soldiers laid down their weapons to wish each other a happy @entity6 100 years ago			2
his mind was changed however by a 1915 newspaper article which quoted letters from a @entity8 soldier to his family , describing the moment each side ' finished up kicking a football between the firing lines '			2
' at first i was very sceptical about it			0
football has hijacked the truce over the past few years , ' mr @entity240 said			0
' there is a danger that all of the true history is going to be lost because people think it was nothing more than a big game of football			0
' the historian had previously come across an account by sergeant @entity273 of the 6th @entity274 describing a game of football against @entity12 soldiers in @entity278 , @entity279 , but had never found anything to support his version of events			2
but an article from the @entity284 in january 1915 revealed a letter , written by corporal @entity286 , of the 1st @entity287 , who fought alongside the @entity274 , in which the very same account is given			0
in his letter home , the soldier wrote : ' we finished up in the same old way , kicking a football between the two firing lines			0
so football in the firing line between the @entity8 and the @entity12 is the truth , as i was one that played			2
' the letter , said mr @entity240 , was enough to convince him of the story portrayed in the emotive advert			0
' in all the years that i have been doing stuff about the truce i have never come across this account by @entity306			0
' there are several accounts of people who claim to have played football but a lot of them do n't stack up			0
just by complete fluke it just happened to arrive just at the right moment so we could actually corroborate it			0
' so we could say , hand on heart , there was actually a game that the @entity287 and @entity274 played in			0
' i was really chuffed with it because it is something i had looked for for years			0
' ' i knew quite a lot of @entity3 veterans and they would have been more than happy with it			0
' look familiar ? @entity327 fans say @entity4 's @entity6 ad is a rip - off of his 1983 pop video @entity327 fans said today the new @entity4 's @entity6 advert enjoys a remarkable resemblance to a major pop video from 1983			1
the former @entity335 spent two weeks at number one with anti-war song @entity337 , and in the video he recreated the famous @entity6 truce in 1914			1
in the video @entity327 played the parts of a @entity8 soldier , and his @entity12 counterpart , who shake hands in @entity14 , play a game of football and exchange gifts - the same sequence seen in the new @entity4 's advert			1
@entity350 tweeted : ' well done , @entity4 's			2
you 've made the video for @entity337 without @entity337 '			0
@entity353 wrote : ' @entity354 try @ sainsburys but for a more realistic imagining of the 1914 # @entity358 , i prefer # @entity359 ! ' and @entity360 said : ' love the sainsburys ad but macca did it first ! ' @entity363 has compared images from the two films so you can decide for yourself , with the @entity327 video at the top and the @entity4 's advert at the bottom of each frame			1
beginning : both films , @entity337 above , and the @entity4 's advert below , both set out that they are set at @entity6 in 1914 deep in thought : @entity327 takes a moment to look a picture of a loved one while the actor in the 2014 version looks at a box of his possessions powerful : both films show the moment two young soldiers meet in @entity14 and shake hands with each other warm : marking the moment their conflict was set aside for @entity6 was also shown in the two videos of the same event famous : the game of football between the two sides remains one of the most memorable moments of the 1914 story similar : the two videos both show the soldiers comparing pictures of their sweethearts back home symbolic : both videos also showed the exchange of chocolate , which @entity4 's believe sums up the spirit of @entity6			1

advert shows famous meeting of @entity3 soldiers in @entity14 on christmas day in 1914
soldiers put down their guns and climbed from the trenches and exchanged gifts with each other
in the advert two young men meet halfway across @entity14 , shake hands and play a game of football
@entity4 's says ' @entity6 is for sharing ' and in advert the @entity8 soldier gives his @entity12 *adversary* chocolate
these chocolate bars will be sold in @entity4 's up until @entity6 to raise money for @entity20
mixed *reaction* as some call ad ' brilliant ' but others say ' cynical ' and *disrespectful* to those who fought in conflict
@entity4 's says they ' tell the story with authenticity and respect and hope to keep alive the memory of the fallen '
@entity327 fans say advert is remarkably similar to his 1983 pop video for number one single @entity337
