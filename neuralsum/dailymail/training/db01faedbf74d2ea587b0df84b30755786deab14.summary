by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 17:57 est , 9 september 2012 the booing of @entity2 , where we saw that time lapse between the noise and his desperate arranging of his features into insouciance , was ' a moment ' that went on for a long time			1
i felt sorry for @entity11 - and that is a new emotion - when she got much the same treatment			1
as the kids go back to school , many parents of children with special needs have just been told they will not be getting help			1
access courses are fast disappearing			2
brave face : chancellor @entity2 smiles as he is booed at the @entity27 the conservatives may love a conservatory , but allowing even bigger home extensions is a joke as a policy			2
the @entity33 are regrouping to the @entity34 rather than reaching out to those they need to win an election			2
only @entity38 , who has used the @entity15 as a rally , is doing ok			2
the back - to - school feel of politics - a reshuffle and prime minister 's questions - seem small fry compared with what is happening out there			1
the government is stocking up on tear gas			2
there are places where miners are using rocket launchers against the police in order to keep their jobs			2
austerity means massive youth unemployment			2
work is no answer if there are no jobs			2
depressing : ' the @entity33 decided to let a generation go to waste ' still , here it 's all runways and loft conversions			1
the obsession with @entity72 is beyond me and i live in @entity74 , so how it plays in other parts of the country is hard to say			2
but it 's not hard to say that the @entity33 decided to let large parts of the country and a generation go to waste			1
the political calculation is that these people were never going to vote @entity85 anyway			2
this is politics devoid of ideas - or even a sense of how this all - white @entity90 appears			1
the announcement that @entity92 , or ' the back channel ' as he was referred to during @entity94 , is to be in charge of the @entity96 is gob - smacking			1
most people do n't think he should be in charge of a doll 's house			1
@entity103 , who swizzed £ 40,000 from taxpayers , is back too			2
in what other job would this be ok ? the moral compass is spinning off the table and yet the man with visibility issues - @entity108 - has only just surfaced			1
sure , he can have a holiday , and at least his friend has reassured us @entity108 is now in a ' deep and reflective space '			2
the bottom of a lake ? he has been thinking deep things , though it 's hard to know much of anything from the teddy bear - baiting of prime minister 's questions			1
and this week just plain weird			2
it was a peculiar carry - on			1
@entity126 sat nodding like some mafioso capo			0
@entity128 , as always , looked as though he was imagining himself elsewhere to get through it , when @entity124 lost his rag and blurted to @entity108 : ' apparently , you still have to bring him [ @entity126 ] coffee every morning - that 's just how assertive and butch the @entity133 really is			1
' morning coffee : ' is butchness now a measure of growth ? ' what is that to do with the price of runways ? is @entity124 calling the @entity142 gay ? is it something to do with public - school fagging ? is butchness now a measure of growth , for , if so , @entity124 is @entity149			1
it 's depressing , though , as halfway through the @entity152 , we do n't know what @entity124 is for - except cuts , centralisation ( education ) and privatisation ( health )			1
@entity159 has to now punch home what it is for , not simply oppose cuts			0
and who really cares any more what the @entity164 are for ? after the display of values this country truly treasures at the @entity15 , we come back to this ? booing is mild compared with the political comedown we are facing			0
those born to rule have no idea how to actually do so			0
this reshuffle is a retreat - forget modernisation and cuddly @entity33			1
however many glass houses are built , stones will be thrown			0
@entity179 is an incredible figure			0
literally - arms , legs , the works			1
she hugs meaningfully , laughs sexily and is a fine orator			0
the speech she gave at the @entity189 ' convention was a reminder that she and @entity191 embody the @entity193 dream			0
they knew poverty and they had been young , in love and in debt			0
but why do wives have to make these speeches at all ? it is political infantilisation of the highest order			0
@entity193 dream : ' @entity179 is an incredible figure - she has it all ' i always thought it was dreadful when they made @entity209 tell us she loved her husband at the @entity212			1
is this what women are for ? to humanise men ? last week , though , it was of course @entity219 's speech that was more powerful , as the old goat reminded @entity193 of better economic times			1
i was in the @entity223 for the last election , where folk would tell you they could n't vote for @entity179 '' cos he is different '			1
the chat - show hosts focused their out - and - out racism on @entity179 in particular			1
yes , this ' uppity woman ' does represent what @entity193 can be - but her sweet talk can not remove the fact @entity193 is still a very divided nation			1
i do try with @entity235 , but it 's another world to me			1
this is not helped by my youngest chanting ' no one cares ' all the way through			0
like her mother , she tends to the view that cake is to be eaten , not filmed			0
but i do see one must have reached a kind of state of @entity247 enlightenment when the biggest worry you have is ' wet fruit ' or ' poor marbling ' in a tart / pie / cake situation			0
huge whoops in my house when @entity255 powered to victory			0
he lost his leg at five to meningococcal septicaemia			0
one of my children had that and we were told to expect the worst			0
proud : @entity255 won gold in the men 's 100m - @entity264 at the @entity27 the worst did n't happen			1
paediatric intensive care is the @entity96 at it finest			0
but ever since then , i have heard from people , like @entity255 , who have lost limbs or hearing and gone on to all kinds of great things			0
doctors are closer than ever to a vaccine for this terrible illness			0
i will be celebrating his medal with a donation to the @entity279 ( meningitis.org )			0
prince @entity280 is more popular than ever since those naked pictures			0
let ’s hope no other @entity283 embrace this strategy			0
we now see why he was partying , as he is going back to @entity287			0
i wish no soldiers harm but this is mission impossible			0
why is he going ? why are any of our young men and women still going ? why ?			0

' it 's depressing as halfway through the @entity152 , we do n't know what @entity124 is for '
' this is politics devoid of ideas - or even a sense of how this all - white @entity90 appears '
