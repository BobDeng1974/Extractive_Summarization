@entity20 will be able to call on the services of @entity0 for the first time as @entity2 boss @entity0 will be in contention for the first time in a month this weekend against @entity5 ' @entity0 will be available , ' @entity20 said			1
' he was very close to being available last weekend but we felt it was not worth the risk			0
' there wo n't be many changes from @entity9			0
at @entity9 we were fantastic , so i do n't envisage many changes			0
' but it 's nice to look at the squad , the second group of players , knowing what you can bring into the squad			2
' that was the pleasing thing last night , the way we played , we enjoyed it , we went forward whenever we could , we looked like we wanted to go out and play football in the cup			0
' they all played really well against a strong @entity11 team			0
it showed we 've got quite a good squad			2
' @entity20 was less than happy with the stadium announcement , made while the match with @entity11 was ongoing , that @entity52 would be the opponents in the fourth round			1
' i made an enquiry after the game , because i was disappointed , if i 'm honest , ' @entity20 added			2
@entity0 gets up to head the ball during @entity2 's home defeat to @entity60 ' i do n't think it should have been announced			1
i do n't know why it was announced and who announced it			0
i 'm sure there will be some enquiries today			0
' i felt it was out of order for both sets of fans , who just wanted to get on with the game			0
' asked if knowing @entity52 , 7 - 0 winners over @entity73 , would be their next opponents with victory had affected his players , @entity20 's response was sarcastic			1
@entity20 , with a smile , said : ' i think that 's why they threw the last goal in , so they did n't go to @entity52 away			2
