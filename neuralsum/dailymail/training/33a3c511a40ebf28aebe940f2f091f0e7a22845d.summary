by @entity0 published : 10:31 est , 20 august 2013 updated : 12:20 est , 20 august 2013 hackers have discovered a way of sneaking dangerous and malicious software onto @entity5 's @entity4 by tricking the store 's reviewers into thinking its safe			1
the app , dubbed @entity10 after the character in @entity13 's famous book in which dr @entity14 has an evil alter ego called mr @entity16 , can be made to look like a harmless game , service , utility app and so on			1
once it has passed @entity5 's strict app review policy , the computer scientists from the @entity21 who developed the technique can remotely change its binary code to make it malicious			1
researchers from @entity21 have developed an app that tricks @entity5 into accepting it on the @entity4 , pictured , by convincing reviewers its safe			1
once the app has been accepted , the designers can tweak its code to make it malicious and carry out attacks to steal people 's data , for example the findings were published in the paper , @entity10 on @entity43 : when @entity44			1
researchers @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , and @entity49 said : ' the key idea is to make the apps remotely exploitable and subsequently introduce malicious control ﬂows byrearranging signed code			0
' since the new control ﬂows do not exist during the app review process , such apps , namely @entity10 apps , can stay undetected when reviewed and easily obtain @entity5 ’s approval			1
' we implemented a proof - of - concept @entity10 app and successfully published it in @entity4			2
we remotely launched the attacks on a controlled group of devices that installed the app. ' the result shows that @entity10 app can successfully perform many malicious tasks , such as stealthily posting tweets , taking photos , stealing device identity information , sending email and sms , attacking other apps			1
' as well as sending messages and stealing @entity78 numbers , the app was also used to open malicious websites on the device 's built - in safari browser			2
the app was dubbed @entity10 after the character in @entity13 's famous book from 1886			1
in the book @entity16 has an evil alter ego called mr @entity16 to be accepted onto the @entity4 , apps must be functional in that they must not crash , include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised			2
they must also have a user function and developers ca n't charge for app that does n't do anything			0
any app that is defamatory , offensive , mean - spirited , or likely to place the targeted individual or group in harms way will be rejected			0
apps that present excessively objectionable or crude content will be rejected along with apps that are designed to upset or disgust users			0
@entity5 spokesman @entity106 told @entity107 that developers have made changes to the @entity43 in response to the @entity21 's research although it 's not known if the flaw has been completely fixed			0
@entity5 has a strict policy on which apps are accepted onto its app store			2
it does n't allow malicious or dangerous apps or apps that contain adult content , but it will also reject apps that do n't appear to have a set use or function			0
this is to avoid rogue apps from appearing on the store			0
all apps are additionally run inside what 's called the @entity43 sandbox , which isolates individual apps and prevents them from being able to communicate with other apps or other built - in programs			0
this is supposed to mean that if one app becomes infected , it ca n't hijack the others , yet the @entity21 's research even managed to bypass this feature .			0

when the app is submitted for review to @entity5 it appears to be safe
once accepted onto the @entity4 , hackers are able to tweak the app to make it malicious
the malicious app can then carry out attacks on the user 's device
it has been dubbed @entity10 after the character from the book
