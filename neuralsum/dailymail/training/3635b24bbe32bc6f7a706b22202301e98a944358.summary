by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:55 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 11:02 est , 10 january 2014 @entity4 's shadow business secretary @entity3 called for curbs on jobless migrants jobless migrants could be barred from moving to @entity8 if they do not have the offer of work under controversial plans being drawn up by @entity4			1
shadow business secretary @entity3 insisted the founding principle of the @entity13 was ' free movement of workers not free movement of jobseekers '			1
it comes after a top @entity20 official accused politicians in the @entity8 of fuelling myths about an ' invasion ' of immigrants , claiming @entity26 's tough rhetoric risks ‘ destroying the future ’ of the @entity8 people			1
mr @entity26 has made clear that tackling immigration from @entity30 would be a key demand of his plan to renegotiate @entity8 ’s @entity13 membership , before staging an in - out referendum by 2017			2
the prime minister has suggested curbs on people from poor parts of @entity30 moving to @entity8 for work while also banning migrants claiming child benefit to send to families back home			1
ahead of work restrictions on @entity46 and @entity47 being lifted on 1 january , the government rushed through laws to stop new arrivals claiming benefits for three months			1
however @entity4 suggested it could go further and prevent anyone moving to the @entity8 if they do not have a firm offer of work			2
mr @entity3 said : ' the founders of the @entity13 had in mind free movement of workers , not free movement of jobseekers			1
and undoubtedly we do have to work with our @entity30 partners to deal with that			2
' what people intended when they built the @entity13 in the first instance was that people who either had a job or had the skills to get a job would move around the @entity13 , ' he told @entity71 's @entity70			0
@entity4 's @entity3 ' the problem that we 've had at the moment is that we 've had , during our time in office - and this is where we did make a mistake - you had high skilled people coming from other countries to do low skilled jobs here			1
' all people want is a system that is properly controlled and managed , and more work needs to be done on that			0
' the remarks are the strongest signal yet of a major new immigration policy from @entity4 , and comes after leader @entity89 vowed to close a loophole which allows migrants to paid less by agencies			0
but a @entity94 spokesman said : ' @entity4 had 13 years to change the @entity13 's rules and fix the immigration system , but they failed to do so			0
' they even decided to opt out of transitional controls on the right of people coming from new member states to work here			0
' that 's why @entity26 's long - term plan is to seek a new settlement for @entity8 in @entity30 , including putting in place new arrangements that will slow full access to each other 's labour markets until we can be sure it will not cause vast migrations			0
we would then put this new settlement to the @entity8 people through an in - out referendum			0
' but @entity89 opposes our long - term plan to fix our relationship with @entity30 and to let @entity8 decide			0
nothing would change under @entity4			0
she insisted @entity8 claim ‘ much more ’ in benefits than @entity13 migrants and accused mr @entity26 of using ' populist ' rhetoric to pddle ' myths			1
taking part in an online web chat , miss @entity122 said : the free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections , ’ she said			1
‘ i ’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders [ in @entity8 ]			0
what is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes ? you are destroying the future of your people , actually			0
pressure : the prime minister has vowed to use his planned renegotiation of @entity8 's @entity13 membership to tackle immigration ‘ what the people who come to work bring to the taxation and social security is much more than they take out			1
“ and those who take out of social security are much more the [ @entity8 ] nationals than the @entity13 citizens , who take advantage of the free movement of people			0
‘ it ’s just a myth to speak about an invasion , this invasion is just not taking place			1
’ but a government spokesman hit back : ' hardworking people expect and deserve a benefits system that is fair to @entity8 citizens and migrants who come here to work but is robust and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law			1
' at the weekend mr @entity26 said : ‘ my job is to put in place proper controls so people ca n’t come here to claim benefits ; to put in proper controls to investigate that people are n’t being paid less than the minimum wage ; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants ; to make sure if people ca n’t sustain themselves , they are removed from our country			2
all those steps we ’ll be taking			0
’ the prime minister insisted it was wrong that the @entity8 taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the @entity13			1
he added : ‘ there are other @entity30 countries who like me think it ’s wrong that someone from @entity206 who comes here , who works hard - and i am absolutely all in favour of that - but i do n’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in @entity206			0
’ but the remarks triggered an angry response from @entity206 's foreign minister @entity216 accused mr @entity26 of ‘ stigmatising ’ @entity206 by singling out the nation ’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform @entity13 welfare rules			2
mr @entity216 said : ‘ if @entity8 gets our taxpayers , should n’t it also pay their benefits ? why should @entity206 taxpayers subsidise @entity8 taxpayers ’ children ? ’ see the full video at : @entity230			2
