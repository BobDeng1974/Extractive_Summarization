before and after : @entity20 , 42 , from @entity21 had a £ 250 @entity11 injection , which claims to liquefy the fat cell which is passed out in urine over the next three weeks the formula liquefies the fat cell which is then eliminated naturally when you urinate over a three - week period			1
the solution claims to completely destroy the fat cells so they ca n’t grow back and it can be used on your thighs , stomach , knees , chin , buttocks , stomach , back and even your neck			1
describing its new treatment , @entity39 say it ' gives you the body you ’ve always dreamed of without fearing the fat will return '			0
the treatment , which claims to be the only registered fat removal injection on the market , says it has no downtime ( other than slight bruising and swelling for 48 hours )			1

melt your fat away : the solution , which claims to completely destroy the fat cells so they ca n't grow back , can be used on your thighs , stomach , knees , chin , buttocks , stomach , back and even your neck ( stock images ) but is it all too good to be true - can it really be effective and safe ? dr @entity77 , @entity78 of 111 @entity79 , said : ' i do n’t use fat removal injectable in my clinic and certainly have no plans to until there is further research and trials published			2
' it ’s always important that prospective patients thoroughly research treatments before they book , and these injectables are very new to the market with little evidence of their efficacy other than that produced by the manufacturer			2
' while the cost is certainly affordable and attractive , those thinking of having the procedure must look at alternatives available that have proven results and existing patient testimonials			0
' also , prospective patients must undergo a full consultation to determine the right procedure for their concern			0
