by @entity0 published : 09:01 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 16:57 est , 7 august 2013 a dog lover was involved in a dramatic rescue of four puppies in a bid to save them from suffocation when a homeless man put them in a @entity10 box			1
in a desperate attempt to slow down a bus carrying the man and retrieve the pets , @entity11 enlisted a friend to drive in front of the vehicle and restrict its speed until she could reach it herself			1
when she got there , she persuaded the driver to open the doors for her and bribed the homeless man to hand over the puppies			1
ms @entity11 , who runs an animal rescue charity called the @entity39 , recounted the story of the dramatic car chase through @entity42 a few weeks ago at @entity43			2
she received a call late at night from her friend @entity45 , another animal charity activist , saying she had seen a homeless man with a sealed @entity10 box containing four puppies			1
ms @entity45 had tried to persuade the man to hand over the dogs for their own safety , but he refused and boarded a bus			2
desperate : the hunt to save @entity54 and the three other dogs involved a late - night @entity42 car chase lucky : the man originally refused to hand over @entity58 , pictured , the smallest of the four dogs scamp : @entity29 gets cosy with a shoe , unaware of the danger he faced before being rescued by @entity11 ms @entity11 told her to pull in front of the bus and drive slowly , to allow her and her husband to arrive on the scene and stage an intervention to save the animals			1
although the bus driver started honking his horn in irritation , the plan seemed to be broadly working , and the @entity73 were able to catch up - accompanied by their own pet dog @entity76			0
when the bus stopped to let passengers off , ms @entity11 wrote , ' @entity78 hits the gas and slides up behind the bus , i hop out and dash for its open door			2
' like a lunatic i am jumping up and down , calling for the driver to open the doors			0
like a completely sane person , he drives away			0
' the bus stopped again a few minutes later and this time ms @entity11 persuaded the driver to let her on by explaining her mission			1
watch a live stream of the dogs in their new home streaming video by @entity98 pals : the dogs are getting on well together and are almost ready to be adopted by a permanent new owner @entity102 : the survival of @entity28 and the others is down to the dedication of ms @entity11 playpen : the dogs were adopted into a loving and nurturing environment at the @entity73 ' home she located the young homeless man , and saw that he was pushing a cart with a @entity10 container which had four puppies inside			1
after striking up a conversation with him , she explained her job and asked if he wanted to get off the bus so they could work out ' how to help his puppies '			0
during a one - on - one conversation monitored from a few yards away by her husband , ms @entity11 convinced the man to hand over three of the animals by giving him cash			1
however , he insisted he had promised the smallest one to a friend , and could not give it up			0
when the group had ensured the safety of the three puppies , mr @entity131 headed into the night to find the homeless man and retrieve the final dog			1
escape ! @entity29 strains to get away during a visit to the vet to ensure he is staying healthy placid : @entity28 seems to be a lot more chilled out when he takes his turn on the examination table he told him : ' you are n't sure your friend is going to take this puppy			2
tell you what - you give your friend some of the money i 'm paying you , then he can pay the fee to rescue another dog from the shelter			0
' happily , the gambit worked , and the @entity73 were able to take all four animals home			0
due to the ' comic book ' nature of the bizarre rescue , the couple named the dogs after characters from @entity164 , @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity54			0
ms @entity11 told the @entity165 : ' never in my wildest dreams did i ever think i 'd be involved in a high - speed chase down @entity169 at midnight , my husband behind the wheel while i direct my friends - via cell phone - to stop a bus by creating a road block with their car			2
' but when i heard there were four lives in danger something instinctually kicked in , and nothing was going to stop me from trying to save these pups			0
' the dogs , which seem to be around 10 weeks old , will be put up for adoption in two weeks ' time .			0
