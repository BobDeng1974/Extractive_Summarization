the mysteries of the @entity1 carved into the @entity3 desert have intensified after gales and sandstorms revealed previously unseen ancient designs			1
a pilot discovered a geoglyph of what appears to be a 196ft - long ( 60 metre ) snake , as well as a type of camelid - such as a llama - above an unidentified bird			1
these new lines join existing geoglyphs of a dog , hummingbird , condor and a monkey , thought to have been drawn by the ancient @entity1 people between the first and sixth centuries			1
some 700 geoglyphs are thought to have been drawn by the ancient @entity1 people between the first and sixth centuries the discovery was made by pilot @entity32 as he flew over the hills of @entity34 and @entity35 , as reported by @entity36			1
archaeologists are now working to confirm the authenticity of the lines			2
the geoglyphs , more commonly known as the @entity1 , were first spotted from the air in 1939 when a pilot flew over the @entity1 region of the @entity3 coastal highlands			1
they were designated as a @entity46 in 1994 , and the area stretches more than 50 miles ( 80km ) between the towns of @entity1 and @entity49 , 248 miles ( 400km ) south of @entity50			2
another previously unseen geoglyph ( pictured ) appears to reveal a 196ft - long ( 60 metre ) snake			1
the discovery was made by pilot @entity32 as he flew over the hills of @entity35 most of the lines ( the dog is pictured ) are formed by a shallow trench with a depth of between four inches ( 10cm ) and six inches ( 15cm )			2
they were made by removing the reddish - brown iron oxide - coated pebbles that cover the surface of the @entity1 desert and exposing the light - coloured earth beneath the mystery about why they were created has been debated for decades			1
one theory is that the geoglyphs are connected in some way to water			2
for example , a triangular geoglyph at the bottom of the @entity73 mountain runs along the water veins inside the mountain , while the condor geoglyph is linked to local legend , which states that when the condor flies over the mountain , ‘ great rains follow ’			0
similarly , the ‘ hummingbird ’ geoglyph only appears in the summer following heavy rainfall			2
all of the drawings were said to have been drawn using a single line , that never crosses itself , and were believed to be an appeal to the gods to bring rain			0
the geoglyphs , more commonly known as the @entity1 , were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the @entity94 planes of the @entity3 coastal highlands			1
they were designated as a @entity46 in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles ( 80km ) between the towns of @entity1 and @entity49 , about 400 km south of @entity50			2
some 700 geoglyphs are thought to have been drawn by the ancient @entity1 people between the first and sixth centuries			1
the @entity1 are drawn into lighter coloured strata which contrasts with darker gravels on the plain			1
in general terms , the geoglyphs fall into two categories : the first group , of which about 70 have been identified , are said to represent natural objects , such as animals , birds and insects			0

the monkey is pictured many of the images also appeared on pottery and textiles of the region			0
other drawings represent flowers , plants , and trees			0
a second is made from lines and more basic shapes such as spirals , triangle and rectangles			0
archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines , which support theory the ancient people used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines			1
most of the lines are formed by a shallow trench with a depth of between four inches ( 10cm ) and six inches ( 15cm ) , made by removing the reddish - brown iron oxide - coated pebbles that cover the surface of the @entity1 desert and exposing the light - coloured earth beneath			1
the largest geoglyph is a 935ft - long ( 285 metre ) pelican ( pictured )			1
most of the lines are formed by a shallow trench with a depth of between four inches ( 10cm ) and six inches ( 15cm ) , made by removing the iron oxide - coated pebbles that cover the surface of the @entity1 desert to expose the light - coloured earth beneath this sublayer contains high amounts of lime which has down the years hardened to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds and prevents erosion			1
contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air , they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills			0
@entity173 , from @entity174 , is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the @entity1			2
he discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the @entity178			0
along with @entity179 , a @entity180 mathematician and archaeologist , @entity173 proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose			0
source : @entity188 experts believe the @entity1 used to dance along the lines of the geoglyphs when they prayed for rain - and many of the same images appear on @entity1 pottery			1
in december 2012 , professor @entity196 , of the @entity197 , said one of the shapes - a spiral motif traced in the @entity3 desert - is likely to have been a labyrinth , created as a ‘ spiritual path ’			1
the huge images , which include hundreds of animals and complex mazes in the @entity1 desert , can only clearly be seen for the air giving rise to a number of explanations as to who they were intended for			1
the mystery about why they were created has been debated for decades			0
one theory is that the geoglyphs are connected to water			0
for example , the condor geoglyph ( pictured ) is linked to local legend , which states that when the condor flies over the nearby @entity73 mountain , ‘ great rains follow ’ the geoglyphs , more commonly known as the @entity1 ( pictured ) , were first spotted from the air in 1939 when a pilot flew over the @entity1 planes of the @entity3 coastal highlands			1
they were designated as a @entity46 in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles ( 80km ) south of @entity50 the @entity1 are drawn into lighter coloured strata which contrasts with darker gravels on the plain			2
‘ they are one of the most impenetrable enigmas of archaeology by virtue of their quantity , nature and size , as well as their continuity , ’ said @entity188			0
‘ the concentration and juxtaposition of the lines , as well as their cultural continuity , demonstrate that this was an important and long - lasting activity			2

another appears to show a camelid , *zig* - *zag* lines and an unidentified bird
