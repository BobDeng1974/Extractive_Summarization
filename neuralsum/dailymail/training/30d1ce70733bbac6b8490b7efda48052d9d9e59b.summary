by @entity0 published : 09:06 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 01:35 est , 11 april 2013 @entity2 's @entity1 has been given a video makeover by a @entity5 firm who have used it to build videos of any journey			1
known as @entity11 , the videos are crated using a series of still images , rather like a traditional paper flipbook			1
users can enter any journey into the @entity18 site , and then see the results unfold as a video journey			1
click below to see a @entity21 the site was created by @entity5 design firm @entity22			0
' @entity25 - lapse photography – a technique combining time - lapse and sweeping camera movements typically focused on a point - of - interest – has been a growing trend on video sites , ' the firm said			2
' creating them requires precision and many hours stitching together photos taken from carefully mapped locations			0
' we aimed at making the process simpler by using @entity1 as an aid , but quickly discovered that it could be used as the source material			1
' it worked so well , we decided to design a very usable @entity42 around our engine and release @entity18			0
' to create a @entity18 , users first plot their route using @entity46 - for instance here , crossing @entity48 the site then creates a ' flipbook ' video of @entity1 images to recreate the feel of a flipbook , the developers said they kept the speed of the video low			1
' the site settings are purposely low ( like having a maximum of 60 frames per animation ) for greater accessibility			0
' ' the idea for this project came from one of our motion designers , @entity68 , as part of his @entity71 experiment			0
he wanted to explore a tool that could help him create hyper - lapse videos with the assistance of available data sets and emerging technology			2
' the results are pretty stunning			2
' users can see any route where @entity2 has pictures			0

@entity84 stitches together *hundreds* of @entity1 images to create a video of any route
results look rather like a *modern* *version* of the child 's flipbook
