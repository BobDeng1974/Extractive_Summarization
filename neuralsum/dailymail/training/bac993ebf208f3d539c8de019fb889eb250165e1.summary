by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor militants in @entity4 and @entity5 pose the gravest threat to @entity7 today , @entity2 has warned			1
the prime minister said the police service and spy agencies have been ordered to focus their efforts on the @entity13 insurgents , particularly those returning to @entity7			1
it comes after @entity1 revealed more @entity7 citizens have signed up to fight in @entity4 and @entity5 than joined the @entity17 last year			1
ministers have been caught off - guard by the speed of the insurgency by the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) sweeping through @entity4 , with more evidence emerging of brutal executions			0
several hundred @entity7 have travelled to the region to join militants in fighting , but just 170 extra reservists enlisted over the past year			1
today mr @entity2 insisted the prospect of battle - hardened jihadists returning to the @entity7 was a ‘ real threat to our country ’			1
speaking at a joint press conference with @entity34 premier @entity33 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ no - one should be in any doubt that what we see in @entity5 and now in @entity4 in terms of @entity21 is the most serious threat to @entity7 's security that there is today			1
‘ the number of foreign fighters in that area , the number of foreign fighters including those from the @entity7 who could try to return to the @entity7 this is a real threat to our country			1
‘ we will do absolutely everything we can to keep our people safe			2
' that means stopping people from going , it means arresting people who are involved in plots , it means focusing our security , our policing , our intelligence effort on to that area of the world , on to those people			1
’ @entity7 is now looking to @entity64 for help in tackling the crisis in neighbouring @entity4			2
foreign secretary @entity67 announced @entity7 is to reopen its embassy in @entity69 for the first time since it was ransacked by an angry mob in 2011			2
' there has never been any doubt in my mind that we should have an embassy in @entity69 if the circumstances allowed , ' mr @entity67 told @entity79			0
' @entity64 is an important country in a volatile region , and maintaining embassies around the world , even under difficult conditions , is a central pillar of the @entity7 's global diplomatic approach			1
' he stressed there were ' a range of practical issues ' that had to be resolved before the base could start to operate again			0
' inevitably , the initial embassy presence will only able to offer a limited range of services at first			0
for the time being , @entity64 will still need to apply in @entity95 or @entity96 for visas for travel to the @entity7 , ' he added			2
young jihadi : a child is pictured on an @entity21 - supporting @entity102 feed wearing a balaclava and holding a sign saying ' @entity105 is greatest ' a senior envoy was appointed as @entity7 's non-resident charge d'affaires last year , as relations improved after perceived moderate @entity109 was elected president			2
there has also been substantial progress reducing tensions over @entity64 's nuclear ambitions			0
however mr @entity2 rejected the idea that the diplomatic rapprochement was connected to the crisis			0
' @entity7 believes in and i believe in step by step building our relationship with @entity64 because we need to have proper dialogue with that country			2
' we are having dialogue over the nuclear weapons issue and i think we should be having dialogue with it on issues of regional security , ' the premier said			0
' obviously our relationship was at a low point after the appalling things that happened with respect to our embassy , but it is right step by step with a clear eye with a hard head , to rebuild that relationship			0
' now we would be doing that anyway irrespective of what is happening in @entity4 , but i think what is happening in @entity4 is certainly not a reason for not taking that step			0
' @entity147 , an expert at the anti-extremist think tank , @entity148 , said the number of @entity150 signing up to fight in the @entity151 would only grow			0
he said : ' people are going from @entity7 and the @entity154 to fight for @entity21 - the estimate is more than 500 and that number will probably rise			1
' if you want to go and fight jihad , @entity21 , which holds a particularly extreme view of @entity13 and wants to create an extreme @entity13 utopia , is a very attractive group to fight for			0
