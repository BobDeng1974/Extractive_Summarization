through months of court proceedings she has retained a steely and impassive demeanor , offering little insight into her emotions on the hearing that has unfolded before her and caught the attention of the world			0
today however , all eyes will be on judge @entity10 as she delivers her long - awaited verdict in the @entity13 murder trial - a decision that could see the athlete jailed for 25 years			1
throughout the six month trial , @entity10 has sat on a dais rarely interrupting the drama unfolding below as the prosecutor sought to prove that the @entity21 athlete murdered girlfriend @entity22 and defense lawyers argued that the shooting was a terrible mistake			0
she has been credited as being a good listener and a dispassionate analyst of facts			1
experts have also , however , pointed to her record of tough action against criminals who have targeted women , suggesting this could be seen as an indicator she would not be easily swayed by @entity13 ' assertion that he shot @entity22 through a closed toilet door on february 14 , 2013 by mistake , thinking there was an intruder in his house			1
last year , she sentenced a serial rapist to 250 years in prison			2
in 2009 , she sentenced a former police officer to life in prison for fatally shooting his wife after a dispute over separation terms			2
for some in @entity47 , @entity10 is seen as a symbol of accomplishment in a country where poverty and unemployment block progress even though all - race politics replaced white minority rule in a euphoric but troubled transition			0
trial : throughout the six month trial , @entity10 has sat on a dais rarely interrupting the drama unfolding below as the prosecutor sought to prove that the @entity21 athlete murdered girlfriend @entity22 and defense lawyers argued that the shooting was a terrible mistake @entity91 , a @entity33 lawyer who teaches criminal law , told @entity93 : ' from our historical background in this country , it is very important that young black people see role models that are positive			0
' i 'm sure that a young female person that 's sitting anywhere in @entity47 ... would be looking up to her and would wish that , if they were to study law , that they would be able to reach that benchmark that she has set			0
' in the rare instances in the @entity13 trial when her personality has shone through , @entity10 has been stern , chiding the prosecutor for harshly questioning the double - amputee runner when he testified in april			1
and she lightened the mood in the wood - lined courtroom when she joked about making lawyers work ' after church ' on a sunday			0
@entity13 could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder			1
he could also be convicted of a lesser murder charge or negligent killing , both of which call for years in jail			1
the judge could acquit him if she believes the 27 - year - old made a tragic error @entity91 described her as a competent judge who gave ' latitude ' to defense and prosecution arguments			0
@entity10 will not ' decide the matter on her own ' because she has two legal assistants , @entity91 noted			0
' there is a remote possibility of the judge going one way and the assessors going another , and the decision by the majority is the one that will stand , on the facts , ' @entity91 said			2
but , he said , only the judge decides on questions of legal principle			0
@entity10 studied social work and later worked as a reporter for @entity151 , the @entity152 and other @entity47 publications , covering township life at a politically tumultuous time			2
under apartheid , she was arrested during a protest against the detention of media colleagues , according to @entity47 reports			0
@entity161 , who worked with @entity10 in the media , said he has closely followed the @entity13 trial and that the judge was exhibiting the same ' level - headedness ' that he remembered in her character decades ago			1
glamorous couple : @entity13 with @entity22 at the @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity47 , in november 2012 , three months before he killed her in 1998 , @entity10 became a provincial judge on a bench that was still heavily populated by white males			1
she has ruled in favor of squatters who resisted attempts to evict them from a @entity169 building and said authorities should help them find alternative lodging ; and ruled against a former head of @entity180 , the national electricity company , who alleged he was illegally dismissed			0
@entity47 does not have a jury system , so @entity10 will read her verdict today in a lengthy process , filled with summaries of testimony and legal references , that some analysts say might require more court time on friday			2
clues about the looming verdict could emerge during the reading , but @entity13 will only know the judgment for or against him at the end of what is likely to be a long reading that will grip the world 's attention			1
@entity13 could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder			1
he could also be convicted of a lesser murder charge or negligent killing , both of which call for years in jail			1
the judge could acquit him if she believes the 27 - year - old made a tragic error .			0
