but they deserved it by playing well in the first leg			2
we had one bad game and that was enough to get knocked out			2
we were missing some good fortune but we did n’t deserve it because we played so poorly in the first leg			2
‘ it ’s difficult after such a good performance to look back and think that in the first game we missed that mental level you need to compete at the highest level			2
you can see how good we are as a team and how well organised we can be			0
we need to consider that every single day in training and in games			0
that ’s why we are so far away			0

we would have more chances to win a title			0
