by @entity0 published : 05:42 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 09:45 est , 19 february 2013 @entity2 's lawmakers have passed a bill allowing people to salvage and eat roadkill in a bid to ' stop good food going to waste '			1
@entity9 @entity8 creates permits allowing individuals to scrape game animals off the road , including antelope , deer , elk or moose			1
the measure passed 19 - 2 last week in the @entity9 and is now set to be considered by the @entity19			2
state representative @entity20 , a supporter of the bill , said : ' people hit a lot of animals on roadways , and i mean a ton of them			2
there ’s a lot of good meat being wasted out there			0
' mr @entity20 said animals like this bull elk will not be targeted because people will not want to damage their cars ' when people first hear about it — roadkill — some of them think this is a crazy bill , but it ’s not , ' mr @entity20 told the @entity40			0
officials at @entity42 are concerned potentially valuable carcasses , such as those of @entity45 , might be targeted for profit			0
he added : ' people are n’t going to intentionally hit an elk when it ’s going to cost them $ 1,500 in damages to their vehicle			0
nor are poachers going to go through the problems of staging a road kill with the possibility of being caught			1
if there ’s something fishy going on , we ’ll catch on pretty quickly , ' @entity20 added			0
deer would be included in the types of animals which permit holders could legally salvage , if the @entity64 succeeds			1

new bill would allow permit holder to keep road - kill if meat is salvageable
lawmakers claim @entity64 will guard against poachers taking *advantage*
