the headquarters of the @entity1 has been sold for £ 370million to a multi-billion dollar alternative investment company based in @entity3			1
the proceeds of the sale - which secured £ 120m more than the guide price and three times what was originally paid for the site freehold in 2008 - will be invested in technology for police officers such as tablets , smartphones and body cameras			0
the @entity16 site , situated next to @entity18 station and famed for its revolving triangle sign which will be moved , along with the @entity1 , to their new home on @entity23			1
it is estimated that the new headquarters should save the @entity1 some £ 6 million in running costs			1
mayor of london @entity39 said the new @entity1 hq was a ' pretty nondescript building ... a lovely building obviously '			2
he said that while @entity16 would be redeveloped , the ' special triangle jobby ' - the revolving sign outside - would be kept			1
the @entity1 moved to its current location beside @entity46 station in 1967			2
after @entity48 founded the @entity1 in 1829 , the new police force had its headquarters in @entity50			2
the rear of this property faced a court yard which led onto @entity54			0
the name @entity16 attached itself to the headquarters building			1
in 1890 , the @entity1 moved to the @entity58 building in 1890 , which was named ' @entity16 '			1
the @entity1 retained the name ' @entity16 ' when it moved to its latest home in 1967			1
the first ever ' police procedural ' television show @entity61 was broadcast by the @entity62 between 1954 and 1956			0
it was based on the memoirs of real - life @entity16 detective @entity64			2
he added : ' @entity67 has a unique place in history and they need a home fit for the future , but police budgets are under real pressure			0
' the sale of this under - used and outdated building means we can now not only protect that rich heritage , but also fund the new hq and kit out bobbies with the latest mobile technology to secure the future of the force			0
' this landmark deal allows us to preserve the past whilst giving today 's @entity1 a vital cash boost so our officers can go on keeping @entity87 safe			2
' @entity88 , chief executive of @entity89 , said : ' ten @entity90 will be one of the most important redevelopment projects undertaken in @entity87 this decade , replacing a world famous headquarters with a world class development			0
' with the bid process now complete , we look forward to creating an exceptional new landmark for @entity87			0
' once redeveloped and sold , the @entity99 site is projected to yield up to £ 100 million in stamp duty receipts for the @entity102 exchequer			2
the sale is part of an ongoing overhaul of the @entity1 estate which has so far raised £ 215 million through the sale of 52 under - used and outdated buildings			1
when completed in 2016 , the restructure is predicted to save @entity87 's police force over £ 60 million in annual running costs - enough to fund 1,000 officers - and will leave behind a smaller , more modern estate which will include a new training facility in @entity115 and a world - class forensics lab and control centre in @entity119			0
the @entity1 moved into the first ' @entity16 ' , pictured , in 1890 after leaving their @entity121 home at the time of its opening in 1967 , @entity16 , pictured , was seen as a state - of - the art location but over the past 40 years , the building has become a liability and was described as not fit for purpose it will be moved to the @entity1 's new hq - the @entity34 on @entity23 , which will continue to be known as @entity16			1
as the home of the @entity1 , @entity16 has moved several times before - from @entity50 to @entity54 in 1875 , to the @entity58 building in 1890 and to the current building in 1967			1
this new move therefore marks a return to nearer its founding location			0
the current hq is home to many unique artefacts and policing memorabilia dating back to the formation of the @entity1 in 1829 - none of which are currently on public display			0
the additional proceeds from the sale means a small portion of money raised can be used to relocate this collection to a dedicated museum site , allowing visitors to see rare crime artefacts and heritage items that tell the history of @entity16 .			0
