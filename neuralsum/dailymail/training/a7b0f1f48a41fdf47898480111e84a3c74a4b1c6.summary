@entity0 will have to raise his game to a higher level than ever before to beat @entity3 , according to @entity4			1
@entity0 has been a shadow of the golfer he once was following serious back injuries this year and finished last in his most recent comeback following major surgery			1
but the @entity11 superstar has 14 majors to his name , including four won in row across 2000 and 2001 , a feat dubbed the ' @entity16 ' and hailed by many as the greatest golf ever played			1
@entity3 , meanwhile , has seized @entity0 's crown as the undisputed world no 1 and won this year 's @entity22 and @entity21 in spectacular style to take his own total to four			1
the 25 - year - old @entity25 will be bidding for three in a row at the masters in april , a title won by @entity0 on four occasions			1
but @entity4 warned his former rival that @entity3 is now playing golf that surpasses anything he has ever achieved			2
' @entity0 is going to come back into the frame , ' @entity44 told @entity46 when discussing next year 's masters			2
' is he going to be able to get back , not just to the levels he was but better than that ? because that ’s where @entity3 's taken the standard of golf : to one level beyond where @entity0 was			1
' @entity3 suffered a spectacular meltdown in the final round at @entity57 in 2011 after holding a four - shot lead after 54 holes			0
but @entity4 insisted @entity3 is ' a much better golfer now than he was then ' and backed him to win the masters			2
' you 'd have to say @entity3 is favourite			0
it 's about time he won it , ' added the @entity64 , who was @entity65 's no 1 golfer for eight years but never won a major championship			0
@entity4 duelled with @entity0 for @entity22 at @entity67 in 2005 but was beaten into second place			1
@entity4 also looked even further ahead , tipping @entity3 to claim a second @entity69 at @entity70 in june and thus a career @entity72 of majors			2
@entity3 will bid for a career @entity72 at the masters , where he suffered a meltdown in 2011 woods once captured four majors in succession , from the @entity69 in 2000 to the masters in 2001 the @entity82 legend was even prepared to speculate that @entity3 could go on to win all four majors in 2015 , which would be six in a row , an unprecedented feat in the sport			2
' if he does win the masters that @entity69 will be a big , big , big do indeed , ' said @entity4			0
' can he win all four in a year ? that ’s another question on people ’s lips within our game			0
can he win all four in a year , never mind two ? that means six in a row			0
wow , that ’ll be something			0
' if you ’re a betting man - i ’m sure there ’s a lot of people putting money on it - i ’m sure it ’s a 100 - 1 shot but it ’s worth a punt			0
' @entity4 has been in action in @entity109 this week on the @entity110 the odds of @entity3 winning all four majors in 2015 are currently 80 - 1 with many bookmakers			1
@entity4 added : ' if i was a gambler , which i ’m not , i ’d put money on that ; he ’s that dominant , and that good			0

@entity0 will have to play his best ever golf to beat @entity3 , says @entity4
@entity0 has won 14 majors but is *battling* back from major surgery
@entity3 is the @entity22 and @entity11 @entity21 , and undisputed world @entity124
