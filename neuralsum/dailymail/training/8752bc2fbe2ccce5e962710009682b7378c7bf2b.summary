@entity1 winger @entity0 is targeting an assault on the @entity4 's top four next season after a near miss. @entity5 passed up the chance to gatecrash the @entity8 party at the end of a nevertheless hugely successful campaign , ultimately finishing in fifth place to claim a @entity13 spot			1
however , @entity0 , who joined the club from @entity15 in january , is confident they can split the big boys next time around after launching new manager @entity19 's tenure in style			1
aiming to go one better : @entity0 says @entity5 must look to break into the top four he said : ' it was in our own hands and we slipped up			1
' we beat @entity25 at home and then we lost to @entity27 , we lost to @entity28 , games that we should have won or we should be winning if we want to be in the top four			0
' but ultimately those two defeats cost us and @entity25 went on and won every single one of their games , so in the end they deserved to be there			0
' but we were challenging the top four , so the challenge next season is to go one better and get into that top four			2
' with the squad we have got there , the manager and the backroom staff , the potential that the players have got , especially seeing as how many of the players are 22 , 23 , 24 , young players , that 's got to be our aim			2
' @entity5 's achievement was somewhat over-shadowed by neighbours @entity49 's title challenge , which came up only just short on the final day as they were pipped by @entity51			1
good job : @entity19 had an impressive start to his career as @entity5 manager however , @entity0 believes @entity5 's achievement was no less noteworthy			1
he said : ' we probably out - performed what everybody expected of us from the start of the season			0
' at the start of the season , the first three games were draws and everyone was thinking , ' this is a different type of football , a different way of playing for @entity5 '			1
' but gradually over time , the manager and the way we play , we have won everyone over			0
we play football the right way and i think everyone is enjoying it			0
' plenty to smile about : @entity0 says he enjoys playing for @entity75 - who he worked with at @entity76 @entity0 is currently on international duty with the @entity1 and desperate to make up for lost time after finding himself consigned to the youth team in the latter days of his spell in @entity81 and arriving on @entity82 somewhat rusty			1
the chance to work again under former @entity76 boss @entity75 as @entity1 face @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 in preparation for the start of the @entity91 qualifying campaign in september , is one he is relishing			2
making his way in the game : @entity0 started his career at @entity76 he said : ' i have got a lot to thank him for			2
he gave me my debut at @entity76			0
i played a few games towards the end of that season , then the next season , i was only 18 and probably played 35 games that season			0
' i was hoping to be coming on in games , but i was playing @entity8 games			0

@entity19 's @entity5 finished fifth in the @entity4 last season to claim a @entity13 spot
@entity1 winger @entity0 is confident his team can *progress* even further
