and when they mocked him over and over again , he attacked the men			0
' and that 's hard to do when you , senator @entity8 , are sending letters to the @entity21 government behind my back			0
' this in reference to the @entity36 @entity35 signing an open letter saying that any deal with @entity21 could be overturned when president @entity0 leaves office in 2017			2
@entity0 then turned to @entity6 and said ; ' or when you , @entity6 , invite the prime minister of israel to speak to @entity18 without consulting me			0
' here he is referring to @entity6 having @entity22 speak earlier this month			0
he continued with @entity10 , saying ; ' or when you , senator @entity10 , call @entity22 an extraordinary leader and side with him over your own president			0

at this moment @entity62 ( @entity63 ) walks in and warns the men that they better get ready as her husband is getting angry , and turning into @entity68 ( @entity69 )			2
