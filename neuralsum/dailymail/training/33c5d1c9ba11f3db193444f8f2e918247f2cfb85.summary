@entity0 is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill @entity3 's boots at @entity4 ... not playing for @entity5 if @entity6 leaves @entity7 for @entity8 he will be considered an expensive @entity10 flop @entity11 and @entity12 have a telepathic understanding that gives @entity5 a fighting chance at @entity15 in decades gone by , top clubs would raid the lower divisions for players			1
@entity19 arrived at @entity4 from @entity20 and became a @entity22 champion			2
@entity23 was a @entity24 player and ended up in a @entity26 semi-final			1
these are a couple of examples – there are many others like @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 – the list goes on			1
most of the examples of players plucked from the lower leagues these days are of talented youngsters who have n’t played many first team games , but have standout talent and potential that takes them to a top club – look at @entity47 and @entity48 as two examples			1
i watched @entity64 beat @entity65 3 - 1 in @entity66 at the weekend and i saw a striker – @entity68 – star for @entity64			1
he was superb – his running was clever , he bullied defenders , he found space , he finished , he was aware of his team - mates ’ runs , and his work rate was phenomenal			2
he was the difference between the two sides			0
he was the top scorer in @entity77 last season , he can score tap - ins and long range goals ( check out his beauty at @entity82 in the the @entity83 this season )			0
my point is not that he ’s a world - beater but he has the raw ingredients , that ’s for sure			0
@entity68 made the difference for @entity64 in their 3 - 1 win over @entity65 on sunday the real test of a manager like @entity91 at @entity92 would be to find and develop a lower league gem @entity94 has spent in excess of £ 150m at @entity96 seeking a quick fix no , my point is that if you are @entity91 , @entity102 , @entity103 , or @entity94 – surely one of the qualities needed to qualify as a top coach must be to spot talent in the lower leagues and turn that talent into a top player ? were any of those four coaches at @entity109 to watch him on sunday ? no , of course not			1
it ’s easy signing players for anything from £ 10m to £ 60m and putting them in the first team			0
what about coaching a player ? is n’t that part of their job , too ? i wonder if any of them have ever heard of @entity68 , let alone watched him			2
i do n’t know if he could make it at the top level			0
but these coaches will never know because they do n’t even bother watching him			0
video @entity102 ' regrets ' @entity91 shove			0

in the past , top clubs would scour the lower leagues for talent and polish these gems into world class players
@entity19 , @entity23 , @entity33 and @entity36 are examples
over-hyped managers should do their own dirty work and coach a player plucked from @entity142 or non-league into a star
@entity68 , for example , *inspired* @entity64 's *victory* over @entity65
