@entity0 is delaying a controversial appointment by speaker @entity2 over fears it could ‘ embarrass the @entity4 ’			2
government sources said the prime minister was effectively sitting on mr @entity2 ’s decision to appoint @entity10 catering manager @entity9 to the £ 200,000 - a - year post of @entity12 , in charge of running @entity14			1
mr @entity2 ’s selection has been criticised by mps on all sides , warning that miss @entity9 lacks the knowledge to advise @entity14 on constitutional matters			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it is an important role and for the individual to be able to carry it out successfully , they need support from mps across the @entity26			2
’ the comments come after senior mps raised concerns over ms @entity9 's lack of knowledge about @entity44 procedures			1
the prestigious £ 200,000 - a - year post combines the clerk 's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of commons chief executive			0
in an effort to defuse the row , mr @entity2 has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs as soon as possible			0
the suggestion has failed to appease critics who are planning a potentially damaging showdown with the speaker when the @entity26 returns from its summer break next week			0
there have been calls for a confirmation hearing before a committee , and a motion could be tabled in the @entity26 to force the issue			0
ms @entity9 , currently head of the @entity66 in @entity67 , was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by mr @entity2			2
he is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the @entity26 , rather than promoting deputy clerk @entity74			0
the prime minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the queen to be finalised			2
the text of a motion that could potentially be tabled by @entity81 backbencher @entity80 next week has been circulated			0
reports suggest up to 50 mps have already pledged to support it			0
it would apparently stop short of demanding ms @entity9 appointment be abandoned , merely insisting there should be a confirmation hearing			1
the mooted text reads : ‘ that this @entity26 believes that the recommendation of ms @entity9 to be clerk of this @entity26 should be subject to , and contingent upon , a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee			1
’ mr @entity2 has been under mounting pressure to delay the appointment			0
former foreign secretaries @entity99 and @entity101 last week added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let mps grill mr @entity2 ’s top choice to become the next @entity26 clerk			1
it came after ms @entity9 finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment			1
former foreign secretaries @entity101 and @entity99 have called for ms @entity112 to appear in front of a parliamentary committee to scrutinise her appointment ms @entity9 , a senior aide in the @entity14 in @entity67 , said she was ‘ disappointed ’ that colleagues in @entity10 had declared that she had ‘ no parliamentary knowledge or experience ’			1
it came after an email was leaked from the @entity10 clerk of the @entity122 , @entity121 , to the @entity26 authorities which warned against her appointment			1
responding to the memo ms @entity9 said : ‘ it would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time , ’ she said			2
‘ as a senior parliamentary officer , i take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the @entity131			0
’ ms @entity121 apparently cited an incident in which @entity134 cameras were used in the @entity10 @entity14 to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator 's office late at night			1
the episode is being investigated , as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity			0
but ms @entity112 said her @entity66 ‘ looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the @entity134 footage was in fact authorised , and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege ’ .			0

@entity9 , a top aide in @entity10 @entity14 , set to be next commons clerk
but choice has *sparked* anger among @entity104 and claims she 's not up to the job
commons clerk advises the speaker and prime minister on @entity163 constitution
campaign has been *launched* for ms @entity9 to be grilled by mps
@entity168 today said appointment should have support of mps
