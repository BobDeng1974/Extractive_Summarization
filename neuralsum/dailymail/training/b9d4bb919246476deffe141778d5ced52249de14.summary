' i can see no good reason at all why @entity2 should be the only part of the @entity4 without this popular and easy conservation measure			1
' it is understood the @entity45 appealed to the @entity6 in to include the measure in the @entity47			2

' junior environment minister @entity84 also suggested responsibility for reducing bag use lay with shoppers not minsters			2

environment minister @entity84 said it was up to shoppers to use fewer bags official figures show around 350million more bags were given out by retailers over last year , despite @entity101 demanding ‘ a drop			1
the @entity103 warned in september 2011 that unless stores delivered ‘ significant falls ’ over the next 12 months , they could either be banned outright from giving out single - use bags or be legally required to charge customers for them			1
instead the number rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion for 2011 - 12 , but so far the government has refused to act			1
a @entity45 spokesman said : ' we want to work with retailers to help them lift their game to cut the number of bags they hand out			0
