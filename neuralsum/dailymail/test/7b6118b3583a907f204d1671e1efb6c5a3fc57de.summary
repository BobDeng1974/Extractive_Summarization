after years of suffering behind its barbed wire fences , watching those they loved waste away before their eyes while @entity8 guards systematically slaughtered them by the tens of thousands - this is the moment the inmates of @entity12 watched as the death camp was burned to the ground			1
steeped in human misery , these huts once contained the bodies of thousands of @entity18 , @entity19 , homosexuals , @entity8 opponents and the disabled , sent to an inhuman death by @entity24 and his demented regime			0
diarist @entity26 , and her sister @entity27 , also died here			0
shortly after the camp was liberated by @entity31 and @entity32 troops in 1945 , it was torched , and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings , along with the @entity36 flag and @entity24 portrait which adorned them , were consumed by flames			1
these hellish images , which were taken by @entity31 reverend @entity41 @entity40 , captured that poignant moment in history for future generations to remember			1
infamous : this is the @entity12 in @entity46 as it appeared in the days after it was liberated by @entity31 and @entity32 troops , adorned with the @entity36 flag ( left ) and a portrait of @entity24 ( right ) historic : as a crowd of people watch on , @entity31 troops burn the buildings to the ground			1
these never - before - seen images were captured by reverend @entity41 @entity40 , who was one of a handful of chaplains who helped liberate it up in smoke : the camp , which became the final resting place of 50,000 jews , @entity19 , homosexuals , @entity8 opponents and those with disabilities , is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 gone , but not forgotten : the images were uncovered by @entity71 , the great - grandson of mr @entity40 , who said he is proud that his great - grandfather was brave enough to take the pictures , so future generations do not forget what happened send off : in dramatic scenes soldiers line up in front of a stage as the camp is torched , bringing to an end the suffering inside mr @entity40 , orginally from @entity82 , was one of just a handful of @entity85 chaplains who made it inside the camp , and whose job it would have been to help cure the sick , and offer last comforts to those who were beyond saving			1
@entity26 , whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the @entity96 became the defining account of the @entity98 , was just one of @entity12 's many victims			2
@entity100 was living in the @entity101 when the @entity96 seized it in 1940 , leaving them trapped			0
in 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside @entity100 's office building			0
they spent two years there , but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps			0
@entity26 , and her sister @entity27 , were taken to @entity12 , where they died of typhus in february 1945 , just months before the @entity111 liberated it			2
when the @entity114 troops arrived at @entity12 , it was in the grip of a terrible typhus outbreak , with prisoners dying at a rate of 500 a day			2
a sombre sign erected by the @entity85 , and photographed by mr @entity40 , documents at least part of that grisly death tool , revealing that 13,000 people perished even after troops came to their aid			2
in other images he documents pits filled with the emaciated corpses of the dead , and cramped buildings filled with the typhus - ridden bodies of those who were still alive			0
the images were brought to light by mr @entity40 ' great - grandson @entity71 , 27 , who decided to publish the pictures after finding them tucked inside an old box among his grandmother 's possessions			1
mr @entity71 , a photo restorer who lives in @entity143 , said : ' i often come across very interesting historical photographs showing stories that impel me to dig deeper and find out as much as i can about the people in the pictures , and what they did with their lives			1
' i never knew him , but my grandmother said he never talked about his time in the war			0
i did n't know why , but now i understand			0
' we had no idea he had taken these pictures , and i feel now is the right time to share them			0
words struggle to describe the unbridled horror within			0
' @entity41 served in the @entity163 during the @entity164 , and because he was aged 39 when the @entity165 broke out , he initially joined the @entity166			2
however he transferred to the @entity167 , and was eventually sent to @entity46			0
@entity41 was one of a handful of @entity85 chaplains who entered the camp in the days following liberation			1
the pictures show the temporary sign erected by the @entity31 shortly after the camp was liberated , revealing just part of the grim death toll			2
during the course of the war , @entity12 became the final resting place for over 50,000 jews , @entity181 , @entity182 , opponents of the @entity96 , homosexuals , and @entity19			2
chilling : this temporary sign was erected by @entity31 troops , detailing just a portion of the grisly death total , which eventually reached 50,000 sickening : inside one of the camp hut , the sick and the dying huddle on the floor in the appalling conditions their @entity8 captors left them in clinging on : survivors huddle inside tents in the wasteland in the centre of the @entity12 camp , where diarist @entity26 also died horrific : around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the @entity111 arrived			1
the number of bodies was so great that the @entity8 captors had given up burying them , and had simply dumped many in the woods mr @entity71 added : ' perhaps the most discussed @entity18 victim of the @entity98 @entity26 died in @entity12 shortly before the liberation , probably of typhus which was rife among the dying			1
' when my great - grandfather arrived at the camp there were nearly 500 people dying each day , from the appalling conditions and the typhus outbreak			0
' along with the other chaplains , medical staff and medical volunteers , he saved many lives and gave both spiritual and medical support to the survivors			0
' they were all true heroes - i 'm so proud he documented what he saw , because it 's important for future generations not to forget			2
' after the war , @entity41 returned to his work as a vicar , and raised two children , @entity71 's grandmother @entity232 and sister @entity233 before dying aged 54 , in 1953			1
mr @entity71 said : ' i never knew him as he died 35 years before i was born but i do know he was a brave man who saved many lives			1
' i have also come to learn how important the non-military members of the forces were , and still are , providing essential support and care at times of need			0
i 'm very proud of my great - grandfather and i know that you do n't have to be a soldier to fight a war			0
' @entity243 : more emaciated bodies are piled in one of the many shallow graves that surrounded the camp , located in northern @entity46 mr @entity40 ( left ) took the pictures following the camp 's liberation after he went inside with other @entity31 troops to tend to the sick			1
when the camp was discovered , up to 500 people a day were dying there from typhus burial : @entity31 soldiers and @entity46 locals helped to bury the dead in the days after the camp was liberated from the @entity96 70 years ago			1

@entity31 reverend @entity41 @entity40 was one of a handful of chaplains to enter @entity12 camp
captured these images , but never told family about them until they were discovered by grandson @entity71
mr @entity71 said he is proud of his grandfather for making sure future generation can never forget what happened
