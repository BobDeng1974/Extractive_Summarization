really , the only surprise was that it took him three touches			0
@entity4 had already chested one down in midfield and rolled a pass to fellow substitute @entity7			2
but his third touch ? well , that was headed into the net			0
that ’s more like it , @entity4			2
so much for the cries for patience			0
here was goal no 30 of the season for a young man who simply can not stop scoring			1
twenty nine for his club and now one for his country at senior level			0
@entity23 clipped an inviting ball up to the back post , where @entity4 ’s instinct had taken him			1
there was just a thin slice of goal to aim for , but he was never missing			0
@entity30 , unaware of the script , attempted to recover , flinging himself across his goal - line but @entity34 ’s goalkeeper could only help it into the net			0
@entity4 celebrates his first @entity37 goal after the white hot striker drifted in at the far post and nodded in @entity23 's cross a jubilant @entity4 laps up the applause from gleeful @entity37 fans as he celebrates his first @entity37 cap with a goal @entity4 connects with the looping ball to nod past keeper @entity30 as his fairytale season continues apace @entity4 shares a brief moment with an official before darting to the touchline to celebrate with team - mates and rapturous @entity37 fans a gleeful @entity4 sprints to the touchline after his goal gave @entity37 a four - goal cushion in front of a packed house at @entity58 @entity59 nods past @entity30 after the @entity61 keeper parried @entity63 's shot into his path to break the deadlock early on @entity59 caught the @entity61 defence flat - footed and scored his 47th international goal to leave him two behind record - holder @entity68 @entity59 had hit the post moments earlier but made no mistake , nodding home from just outside the six yard box with the goal gaping @entity59 celebrates his goal in front of a packed @entity58 as @entity37 continued their 100 per cent record in their qualifying group @entity59 celebrates as @entity63 ( floored ) connected with @entity80 's cross before it deflected off a defender and into the net @entity63 's goal was a timely tonic and gave @entity37 the perfect boost before heading into the dressing room at half - time @entity59 and @entity63 embrace after the latter 's goal gave @entity37 breathing space just before the break @entity23 scored his first goal in an @entity37 shirt after the @entity96 man latched on to @entity59 's cross inside the six yard box @entity23 gave @entity34 keeper @entity30 no chance as he tapped in from point blank range to give @entity37 a three - goal advantage @entity37 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity103 7 , @entity104 5.5 , @entity105 6 , @entity106 6 , @entity107 5.5 , @entity80 7 ( @entity7 71 , 7 ) , @entity108 7.5 , @entity109 7.5 , sterling 8 , @entity63 8.5 ( @entity111 76 ) , @entity59 8 ( @entity4 71 , 8 )			1

booked : @entity127 , @entity136 referee : @entity150 ( @entity151 ) 6 attendance : 83,671 ratings by @entity154 somehow , it all seemed preordained , as if you could have tied up @entity4 ’s bootlaces , blindfolded him , sat him on a chair in the centre of the penalty area and he would still have scored somehow			2
the 21 - year - old @entity162 striker , who has been on fire in the @entity164 , was off and running in international football 79 seconds after replacing @entity59			1
who needs time to adjust ? this was the third - fastest goal by an @entity37 debutant and the quickest since @entity171 in 1951			1
quite understandably , @entity4 could barely control his delight , pushing the referee aside as he sprinted into to a jubilant knee - slide by the corner flag while the @entity58 crowd leapt to hail their newest hero			2
all this was quite surreal			0
no wonder he described it as ‘ just a blur ’			0
the fourth goal of an easy win against a team ranked 94th in the world in the midst of a humdrum campaign has no right to command such excitement but it is impossible not to be swept along by this incredible story			0
until then it had all been about @entity59 ’s steady pursuit of sir @entity68 ’s @entity37 goal record and @entity63 ’s wonderful display of attacking verve , which rightly earned him the man - of - the - match vote			1
@entity59 needed less than six minutes to score the opener and might have had more on a night when he hit the woodwork twice in the first half			1
@entity37 ’s second was probably an own goal but was claimed by @entity63 , who deserved it in a way for a display which justified @entity125 ’s decision to select him and leave @entity4 on the bench for three - quarters of the game			1
@entity23 converted the third — his first international goal — timing his run to perfection and tucking away @entity59 ’s cross from the right			1
it meant @entity37 had secured their fifth successive win in @entity217 long before @entity4 came on to thrill @entity58			1
@entity125 will reflect on the game with satisfaction			0
his team are six points clear with one foot already across the channel at @entity223 , and promising young players like @entity4 are forcing their way into contention			2
@entity4 comes on for @entity59 for his first @entity37 cap and the @entity162 striker made a dramatic introduction to international football sterling wheels away after giving @entity37 a three - goal cushion on a comfortable night for the runaway @entity217 leaders @entity59 is all smiles after @entity63 made it 2 - 0 just before the half - time whistle @entity4 and @entity105 greet each other following the final whistle with @entity37 maintaining a six - point cushion at the top of @entity217 the manager will also have been content with his team ’s balance and shape , which flexed from a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 into a classic 4 - 3 - 3 when @entity37 had the ball			1
@entity108 sat in front of the centre halves and supplied a trio of mobile strikers , while @entity80 and @entity109 covered the midfield miles			0
it will be different in a tougher game when @entity108 is expected to shield his back four , but here is the perennial problem			0
@entity37 need one method to qualify — breaking down teams who surrender possession and offer no ambition — and an entirely different one when they reach the finals and come up against more clinical and potent opposition			2
@entity34 started nervously at @entity58 and @entity125 ’s team were smart enough to take advantage			0
@entity59 hit the inside of a post having been released by @entity109 , before scoring his 47th @entity37 goal with a simple header after @entity30 had pushed a fine effort from @entity63 into the air			1
@entity37 ’s captain hit the other post midway through the first half			2
again , @entity63 created it , this time by driving to the by - line and picking out @entity59 at the far post			1
his header was firmly sent back from whence it came , as in the textbooks , and @entity58 held its breath as it looped through the air and hit the frame of the goal			2
@entity109 was denied a first goal in an @entity37 shirt as his crisp volley was repelled by an excellent reflex save from @entity30 @entity125 will be a very happy man after another convincing win with four different scorers and another clean sheet @entity23 and @entity129 collided in what looked like a 50/50 challenge and the @entity37 man was unfortunate to be booked @entity104 clears the ball upfield despite pressure from @entity135 as @entity37 launch another attack as @entity37 began to wonder if they would extend their lead , they enjoyed a little luck by way of a scruffy second			1
@entity80 worked a short corner with @entity107 and delivered an inswinging cross towards @entity63 , who stooped and skewed a glancing header off his shoulder which was deflected into the net from the right thigh of @entity34 captain @entity128			1
it was swiftly declared as @entity63 ’s goal , and the @entity312 striker seemed happy to claim it			2
@entity30 reacted well to keep out @entity109 ’s volley after the break and @entity63 deserved a penalty as @entity37 dominated			1
@entity23 , who grew into the game and was far more influential as @entity34 tired , celebrated his first international goal by tucking in a cross from @entity59 via the near post			1
and then @entity4 appeared to a raucous reception			0
this crowd believed the hype			0
they had cheered through his warm - up routine and they demanded a goal as he sprinted on			0
it was n’t an easy finish			0
but it was never really in doubt , was it ? on the bench , @entity59 stood to applaud and like everyone else present , he could not help but smile and shake his head			0
@entity59 makes a nuisance of himself in the @entity34 box , stealing the ball off the toe of @entity127 in a typical act of doggedness @entity133 clears the ball in an acrobatic fashion as @entity34 repel wave after wave of @entity37 pressure the @entity37 players huddle together before kick - off looking to maintain their 100 per cent record in the qualifying campaign @entity4 was named on the bench but when his chance came he grabbed it with both hands as @entity37 now look to tuesday 's friendly with @entity357			1

@entity59 opened the scoring in the sixth minute after reacting first to a *rebound* to score his 47th international goal
@entity63 's deflected header doubled the lead just before the break to put the hosts in total control
@entity23 converted @entity59 's cross from inside the six yard box after 58 minutes
@entity4 was handed his first @entity37 cap , coming on for @entity59 in the 71st minute
and he duly nodded home @entity23 's cross 79 seconds after coming on to continue his fairytale season
