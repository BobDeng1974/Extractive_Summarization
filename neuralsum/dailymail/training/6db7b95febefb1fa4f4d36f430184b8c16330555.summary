by @entity0 published : 22:28 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 02:32 est , 24 october 2013 the gap between the numbers of rich and poor pupils going to university ' remains large ' a damning report has warned			1
new figures suggest that a teenager 's chances of going to university still depend heavily on where they live , their background and their gender			1
aspiring pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds would need to treble their enrollment figures to match those from wealthier areas , the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) reported			1
aspiring pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds would need to treble their enrollment figures to match those from wealthier areas ( posed ) and the financial pressures of university fees are effectively freezing out potential @entity25 postgraduates , which has led to their foreign peers outnumbering them in @entity25 higher education institutions , another study showed			1
in areas of the country where few students go into higher education , women were over a third ( 35 per cent ) more likely to go than their male peers			2
in the late 1990s , teenagers living in areas of @entity36 where high numbers of students went into higher education were four times more likely to study for a degree than those living in areas where few people chose to continue their education			2
by 2011/12 this had narrowed with those living in ' high - participation ' areas three times more likely to go to university than those in areas of ' low - participation '			2
but the report adds : ' young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas			1
' professor @entity61 , director of fair access to higher education , said he was pleased to see ' sustained progress ' in the numbers of disadvantaged students going to university			1
figures show poorer @entity25 students are becoming less and less likely to apply for higher education because of a lack of financial support but he added : ' young people from the most advantaged neighbourhoods in @entity36 are still three times more likely to go to higher education than the most disadvantaged young people			1
' meanwhile , there has been a 40 per cent decline in part - time study over recent years , which is worrying because part - time students are more likely to come from groups that are currently under - represented in higher education			0
' addressing these complex issues requires universities , colleges and schools to work together , engaging across the learner 's whole lifecycle			0
' this means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option , supporting teenagers as they make key decisions , and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students			0
it 's also vital that policy is joined up across all education sectors			0
' despite the gaps , a rising numbers of young people are choosing to go to university , with women more likely to study for a degree than men , the @entity18 figures show			2
more than a third ( 38 per cent ) of those who were 18 in 2011/12 went into higher education , up from three in 10 ( 30 per cent ) of those who were the same age in 1998/99 , according to data published by the @entity18			0
the data looks at the proportion of school leavers going on to university , taking into account their sex , background and home town , from the late 1990s up until 2011/12			2
the findings show a 26 per cent increase over this period in the proportion of 18 - year - olds continuing their education beyond a-levels and equivalent qualifications , with most of the rise happening from the mid- 2000s onwards			0
@entity18 's report says that by 2011/12 , women were , on average , over a fifth ( 22 per cent ) more likely to attend university by age 19 than men			0
the gap is most distinct in the capital , with 18 - year - olds in @entity139 the most likely group to go to university , with the rift between the proportions of teenagers in the city and those in the rest of the country widening , the study shows			0
by 2011/12 youngsters in @entity139 were over a third ( 36 per cent ) more likely to go into higher education than those who were the same age in the late 1990s , and were around 43 per cent more likely to go than young people living in the @entity154 , the region where teenagers are the least likely to continue their education beyond a-levels			0
the findings show that the areas where youngsters are the least likely to go to university tend to be along the coast , in rural parts of the @entity163 , the @entity164 and the @entity165 as well as in former industrial towns in the @entity164 and the @entity167			2
meanwhile , foreign students have outnumbered their @entity25 counterparts in postgraduate education at @entity25 universities since 2008 , a report revealed today			1
international student numbers have soared by 90 per cent in the past decade while the number of home - grown students has fallen by 12 per cent in the past three years , a report by the 1994 group of universities said			0
there may be a future crisis as there will be a dearth of skilled @entity25 professionals , the @entity180 reported			0
instead , universities could teach the @entity25 's economic rivals skills they would use to compete against @entity25			1
figures show poorer @entity25 students are becoming increasingly less likely to apply because they do not have financial support .			1

gender , background and where students live *affect* chances of going to uni
aspiring pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds would need to treble their enrollment figures to match those from wealthier areas
*spiralling* university fees blamed for pushing out @entity25 postgraduates
@entity25 universities could end up teaching foreign students skills they could use in countries that economically rival @entity25
