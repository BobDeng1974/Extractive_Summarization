by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 14 november 2013 @entity1 has revealed the @entity3 car seat may be exchanged after it failed tests carried out by experts at which ? @entity1 has withdrawn its latest hi - tech child car seat – the @entity3 – amid safety fears			1
the hi - tech design , which costs £ 216 , failed tests carried out by experts at the consumer group which ? the manufacturer insists the product , designed for children from the age of nine months to the point they are big enough for the normal seat , meets all industry standards			1
however , it has decided to offer an exchange following a series of stringent tests carried out by consumer groups			1
the @entity3 was one of 16 child car seats tested by @entity27 , the @entity28 automotive club , for @entity30 consumer organisations including which ? the seat was marketed as being a safety advance in that it includes a five point safety harness , likened to those used by racing drivers			2
it also includes padded wings to keep a child secure , a moveable head rest and pads across the chest straps to limit any injury during an impact			0
which ? child car seat researcher , @entity47			2
said : ‘ the @entity3 looked like an exciting new product that offered a long useful life span and the possibility to use a five - point harness for longer - which was good news for parents with heavier toddlers			2
‘ but it did not meet all of our high expectations when we got it to our test lab and scored so poorly in one test that we had to rate it as a @entity60			0
’ the @entity3 can be used for children between 9 - 36kg in four different modes , all of which were tested in simulated crash tests			0
which found ‘ severe weaknesses in frontal impact safety ’ where the adult seatbelt – rather than the five point harness - was used for larger children			0
in simple terms , a child was in danger of being thrown forward and injuring themselves in a crash			0
miss @entity47 said : ‘ our tests are more stringent than the legal standard and @entity1 was not obliged to withdraw the @entity3 from sale			1
‘ so we are really pleased that @entity1 has taken these disappointing results seriously and has acted fast to remove the @entity3 from sale and offered to refund or replace seats that have already been sold			1
’ manufacturers @entity1 said the hi - tech car seat , for children aged from nine months , meets all industry legal standards ( stock image ) which ? tests around 35 new child car seats each year and says its independent crash tests are more stringent that the @entity94 regulation @entity95 that car seats must comply with to be sold in the @entity97			1
its front crash test is carried out at a higher speed than @entity95 - about 40mph instead of 30mph - and it includes a side impact crash test , which @entity95 does not require			0
child car seats are tested in a real car body , not on a sledge with a car bench seat fixed to it , so the position of the seat belt anchorage points and car seat characteristics are more realistic			2
@entity1 said : ‘ in the test results , the @entity3 received sufficient scores in all usage modes with the seat 's integrated 5 - point harness			1
however , it received an ‘ insufficient ’ score from @entity27 in usage modes with the vehicle 's adult seat belt			0
‘ parents should rest assured , that the @entity3 has been fully tested , approved and certified in accordance with the legal standards applicable in the @entity97 ( @entity95 / 04 ) and has passed all legally required safety and other tests in all usage modes			1
@entity27 's opinions and ratings do not change this position			0
‘ however , simply meeting legal standards is not what @entity1 is all about and is not what our brand represents			1
we make premium products , work to very high standards and expect our products to deliver best - in - class performance in the most demanding tests			0
‘ we have , therefore , taken the decision to stop actively manufacturing and selling the @entity3 in its current form			0
’ @entity1 is offering a full refund or a redeemable store voucher equal to the purchase price paid for parents who return their @entity3 to the store they bought it from .			2

the @entity3 , priced at £ 216 , failed tests carried out by experts at which ?
manufacturer insists the car seat meets all legal industry standards
but @entity1 has offered to exchange and stopped making the current model
*spokesman* said ' simply meeting legal standards is not what @entity1 is about '
