by @entity0 the sweltering @entity2 summer has led to an early apple harvest with fruit growers heralding one of the ' juiciest ' crops on record			1
as well as apples , strawberries , plums and wheat are all being harvested weeks earlier than in 2013 , after basking in glorious sunshine for the past two months			2
but with predicted showers and the tail end of a hurricane on the way , farm hands are getting to work before the scorching summer becomes a distant memory			1
heavy rain is expected across much of the country today , with downpours and thundery storms predicted in central and northern regions as the tail end of @entity25 hurls towards the south coast			1
the mild spring and warmer sunny weather has meant good news for all types of growers , with stone fruit like plums and cherries , and pears all doing well			1
this summer was also the earliest oilseed rape harvest since the crop was first grown in the @entity2 30 years ago			1
specialist grains such as @entity77 , used for real ale brewers , have also flourished			0
@entity79 of @entity80 and @entity81 said conditions had been kinder to apples than the last couple of years , which had been beset with poor weather , but it was too early to make comparison ’s with 2011 ’s peak			2
' last year we had a very late crop , and we lost three to four weeks of varieties not being on the shelf at the supermarket so we lost that shelf space , and that made life difficult			1
' but this year , all told , things are looking very promising for the coming season			0
' quality is extremely good , we ’ve had a lot of sunny weather , meaning taste will be very good , and the texture and colour will be extremely good			2
@entity80 and @entity81 said the high temperatures had been kinder to apples than in recent years but that it was too early to tell if this summer was better than the fruit 's peak in 2011 @entity30 apples at @entity110 in @entity111 are being pulled from the trees in what is known as a ' late thinning ' carried out to give other fruit a healthier chance of long - term growth “ as far as the shopper is concerned they ’ll be very happy with the eating quality			1
' the apples will have great crunchiness , lots of taste , and a good size			2
' early varieties set to appear on shop shelves include @entity128 , @entity129 , followed by @entity130			0
mr @entity79 said chefs ’ favourite the @entity133 apple was also ' looking good ' , adding ' people will enjoy cooking with that variety this autumn '			2
at @entity110 in @entity111 near @entity33 in @entity34 , the @entity137 family grow 100 acres of apples some of which go to supply @entity140 and are also used in the manufacture of @entity143 cider			0
@entity137 who runs the farm with husband @entity145 just a few miles from the rolling @entity146 , said : ' on the whole it ’s looking like a really nice crop and it ’s all down to the weather			2
the sun rises over @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity154 , this morning after a humid night			0
temperatures are expected to drop next week across the country most of the country will see showers today after a long stint of warm , dry weather with thundery storms expected later in the weekend as @entity163 approaches ' we 've had lovely weather , we 've had rain when we ’ve wanted it , although some parts of the country have been drier than we ’d have wanted			1
' we 've had some disease pressures which we always get with our climate , which might mean the skins are n't absolutely perfect in some cases			0
' but generally - speaking , the crunch is going to be juicy and delicious			0
' while the good weather has brought about a record - breaking produce , sunny summer days will soon be a thing of the past with thrashing rain and thundery storms expected in some parts of the country this weekend			1
' today there are yellow warnings for the southeast , the midlands , the north west and northern @entity188 for rain			1
we 're looking at maybe 20 - 33ml within those areas with chances of heavy , sharp downpour and thunder and lightning because of the humidity , ' said @entity197 , a spokesman for the @entity198			1
' tomorrow for most is better with areas of prolonged sunshine			0
' temperatures in @entity202 will reach the mid 20s while northern regions will remain in the high teens			0
' it 'll be a nice pleasant day but people need to keep an eye on the forecast for sunday which is when the weather really moves in , ' she added			2
the storm could spread further north than previously expected with 50ml of rain predicted in some parts if it hits			1
' it 's still volatile at the moment , we 're still watching and it may modify and change			0
it may miss us but it 's very difficult to tell exactly where the storm might hit			0
' @entity224 , @entity225 , said : ' heavy rain on sunday may lead to localised surface water flooding in some parts of @entity229 and @entity230			1
' on sunday and monday a combination of high spring tides and strong westerly winds bring a risk of large waves and spray and possible flooding to the south west coast of @entity229 and along the @entity239			1
' however , the forecast remains uncertain so we advise people to regularly check the flood risk situation over the next few days			0
' if you 're travelling to or from holiday then check your flood risk before setting off and do n't drive through flood waters			0
' temperatures will lower next week with cooler nights and less humidity on the way			0
' there 's certainly a cooler feel next week , we 're not returning to the high 20s that we 've enjoyed so far			0

scorching summer temperatures have brought fruit and crop harvests forward by as much as three weeks
growers say balmy weather has produced one of the ' *tastiest* and juiciest ' crops on record
good weather will soon be a distant memory with heavy showers and thundery storms expected this weekend
tail end of @entity25 could see a month 's worth of downpour fall in a matter of hours on the south coast
