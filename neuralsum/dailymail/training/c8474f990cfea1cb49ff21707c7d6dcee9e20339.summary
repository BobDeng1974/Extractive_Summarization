top gambler : multi-millionaire mr @entity1 , 36 , has been dubbed ¿ the @entity2 of poker ¿ one of the world ’s top gamblers won £ 7.8 million in a game of chance by ‘ reading ’ the backs of the cards , claim the owners of @entity12 ’s oldest casino , who are refusing to pay out			1
@entity1 , dubbed ‘ the @entity2 of poker ’ , is understood to have exploited tiny flaws in the card design during a game of punto banco , a type of baccarat based purely on luck			1
he insists he did nothing illegal , however , and is suing @entity21 in the @entity22 in what is expected to be the biggest legal battle in casino history			1
the technique has echoes of @entity28 , a 1966 film starring @entity30 as a playboy who breaks into a card manufacturer to mark the cards and then beat the bank at every @entity36 casino			1
the @entity37 , which revealed last october that mr @entity1 ’s winnings had been withheld , understands the cards were flawed because of a mistake during the cutting process at an overseas manufacturing plant			1
crucially , it meant their geometric pattern was not symmetrical , though this would not have been noticeable to the untrained eye			0
cards should look exactly the same if turned 180 degrees			2
if they do not , it allows so - called advantage players to use a system known as ‘ playing the turn ’			0
multi-millionaire mr @entity1 , 36 , was accompanied by an unidentified @entity54 woman and was the only person playing against the croupier over three nights at the exclusive @entity21 last august			1
his remarkable winning streak was witnessed by a casino inspector and ten video @entity61 gambling £ 50,000 per hand , which can be over in less than a minute , he was later given permission by the management to increase his stake to £ 150,000			2
it is thought his companion , who is banned from at least two casinos around the world , was also able to spot the imperfections and helped mr @entity1 place his bets			1
like mr @entity1 , she lives in @entity72			1
along with two others , she is said to have won more than $ 1 million in similar fashion in the @entity75 in 2011 , but the money was similarly withheld and the casino ’s decision was later upheld by a gaming commission			1
it is not clear if mr @entity1 and the woman heard about the rogue cards at @entity21 before arranging the punto banco game or simply noticed them while playing			1
@entity85 is the sister game of @entity87 , the high - stakes card game favoured by @entity89			2
the aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine			2
you bet that either the hand held by the player ( punto ) or banker / croupier ( banco ) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table			1
tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as zero			0
though mr @entity1 was not allowed to touch the cards at any point , he is thought to have instructed the dealer to tilt each card back to expose its value			1
break the bank : @entity30 in @entity28 about a marked - card scam the key cards he was looking out for were nines and eights , and possibly sevens and sixes			0
when these cards appeared , his companion asked for them to be rotated 180 degrees , pretending that mr @entity1 was superstitious			1
as this appeared to give him no advantage , the dealer acquiesced			0
the rotated cards were returned to the shoe and were easily recognised by the player as different when they were eventually re-dealt , giving him a strong edge			0
at first , his losses were heading towards £ 500,000 but he recovered , and at the end of the first night was £ 2.3 million up			0
he is also thought to have persuaded the casino not to destroy the cards at the end of each session , which is normal practice			2
by ‘ holding the shoe ’ his rotated cards were preserved for the following day ’s play			2
the 184 - year - old casino , the oldest private gaming club in the world , initially agreed to transfer his winnings to his bank account , but nine months on it has returned only his £ 1 million stake			2
@entity21 is owned by @entity145 , a @entity146 gaming corporation , which sent investigators to @entity148 to question employees and scrutinise hours of @entity151 footage			0
@entity152 , a leading casino suveillance specialist , warned the gaming industry about flawed cards in november 2011			2
he described their exploitation as the ‘ latest scam to hit @entity72 casinos ’ , adding : ‘ not every player who wins a lot of money at the casino is a cheat			0
you do n’t have to be			0
legal battle : @entity21 casino in @entity168 is being sued by @entity1 after he played there for three nights last august ‘ by turning an asymmetrical card 180 degrees it is possible to identify what the value of the card is before it is revealed			1
you simply glance at the edges on the back of the card			0
‘ essentially , playing the turn has the same effect as marking the cards and gives players a huge house edge			0
‘ who needs invisible ink and red - tinted sunglasses when you ’ve got manufacturer - made “ marked cards ”			0
’ mr @entity152 said casino card manufacturers are under pressure to produce more and more cards , mainly due to massive demand in @entity193 where millions are used — and destroyed at the end of each session — every day			1
‘ inevitably quality control goes down because of this , ’ he said last night			0
‘ @entity198 should be vigilant when it comes to manufacturer defects and flaws			0
’ mr @entity1 said : ‘ i was given a receipt for my winnings but @entity21 has withheld payment			1
i have no alternative but to take legal action			0
’ a spokesman for @entity21 said : ‘ we shall be defending this claim vigorously			0

@entity1 is *accused* of ' reading ' the cards in a game based purely on luck
mr @entity1 ’s winnings were withheld by @entity168 casino @entity215
he insists he did nothing illegal in a game of punto banco
