by @entity0 @entity1 is celebrating its official 2,767th birthday next week			1
but at least 100 more candles should be added to the @entity1 ’s cake if experts are correct in thinking that @entity1 is between 100 and 200 years older than previously claimed			1
it has been said that the ancient city was founded on april 21 in the year @entity8 , partly based upon the myth of @entity10 and @entity11			1
more ancient than thought : @entity1 is officially celebrating its 2,767th birthday next week , but archeologists ahve discovered a piece of wall that suggests the is between 100 and 200 years older than previously claimed			1
a view of the @entity18 is pictured from the ancient @entity19 @entity10 and @entity11 were twins born of @entity21 , daughter to @entity22 , the king of @entity24			0
before their birth , the king 's brother @entity25 seizes power and forces @entity21 to become a vestal virgin , sworn to chastity			0
she conceives the twins by the god @entity35 and @entity25 leaves them to die by the @entity36 when he finds out			0
they are saved by a she - wolf , are fed by a woodpecker and they are bought up as shepherds			0
ignorant of their ancestry , they prove to be great leaders and when they find out the truth , kill @entity25 and restore @entity22 to his throne , before founding a new city - @entity1			1
@entity10 wants to found the city on @entity19 , while @entity11 prefers @entity48			0
after an argument , @entity11 is killed and @entity1 is founded and named after the victorious twin , @entity10			2
the myth was developed into an ' official ' story in the @entity55 and early @entity54 era of @entity1 , with @entity57 historians dating the city to between 758 and @entity59			2
the official date of the formation of @entity1 is april 21 in the year @entity8			1
but archaeological evidence suggests that @entity1 could predate the popular establishment date by 100 or more years			1
@entity65 newspaper @entity64 reported that @entity66 , the archaeologist who is responsible for @entity1 ’s @entity18 , has discovered a wall that was constructed before the founding date of the city			1
it is made from blocks of volcanic tuff – a material made from compressed volcanic ash - and looks like it was built to channel water from an aquifer running from under the @entity76 to the @entity77 , which is a small tributary of @entity1 ’s @entity79 , according to @entity80			1
archaeologists also found pottery fragments and the remains of food next to the wall , which is located close to the @entity85 , or @entity85 , which is a shrine that @entity57 visited to recognise the earliest days of the city			2
dr @entity66 said : ‘ the examination of the ceramic material was crucial , allowing us today to fix the wall chronologically between the 9th century and the beginning of the 8th century			0
’ a bit of a howler ? the discovery of the wall hints that the construction of the city in stone began earlier than documented by @entity57 historians , who based their version of events on the myth of @entity10 and @entity11 who were said to be raised by a she - wolf ( a famous statue is pictured ) the discovery of the wall hints that the construction of the city in stone began earlier than previously imagined			2
the site near to where the wall was found includes a block of stone called ' @entity110 ' with what is thought to be the earliest inscription in @entity113 , written in approximately @entity114			0
while the meaning of the engraving is n’t known , there is a rumour that anyone who damages the site will be cursed			0
archaeologists have been excavating the site since 2009 using historic photos and research to make new discoveries			0
they include the work of famed archaeologist @entity128 , who led the excavation of the @entity18 from 1899 until 1925 when he died , @entity126 reported			0
the site near to where the wall was found includes a block of stone called ' @entity110 ' with what is thought to be the earliest inscription in @entity113 , written in approximately @entity114			0
the aquifer , of which the wall is thought to have been a part , ran from the @entity76 ( marked on the map ) to a tributary of the @entity79 from his images , dr @entity141 's team made 3d models of the site and used laser scanners to determine the wall 's exact location			1
the old adage that @entity1 was n’t built in a day is true and experts think the city started as a small settlement that grew over the years and that the traditional date for its foundation was merely invented by a writer later in the city ’s @entity57 history			1
the wall could therefore hint at one of the earliest parts of the settlement , from which the rest of the city spread from			0
historians have previously said there is evidence of people settling on the @entity19 – the centremost of the @entity167 and one of the most ancient parts of the city – as early as the 10th century @entity171			2

@entity1 is celebrating its 2,767th birthday next week and could be between 100 and 200 years older than thought
it has been claimed that the ancient city was founded on 21 april in the year @entity8 , but new evidence appears to *disprove* the theory
a wall made of volcanic tuff that looks like it was part of an aquifer near the @entity76 suggests that the city predates its ' founding ' date
