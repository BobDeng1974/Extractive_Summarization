in the home of the future , the front door will ‘ talk ’ to your smoke alarm , lights will flash when the fridge door is left open and a teddy will put your child to bed			2
that ’s the vision presented by @entity11 at this year ’s @entity12 in its connected home , which shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile , or be linked together electronically			1
other features include the august smart lock that unlocks the front door when the home owner is near , smart tvs that show notifications and can warn when a child is using the web when they should be asleep and a system that lets you change all the clocks in your home at the touch of a button			1
@entity56 is an open source project set up by chipmaker @entity11 in 2011			2
it is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘ talk ’ to other devices running @entity56			2
the company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further			1
the august smart lock ( pictured ) secures @entity11 's smart house			1
fitted to the existing door lock , the battery - powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the august app. it can be connected to smart lights that flash when the door is opened to open the lock ( pictured left ) , anyone with a code can approach the door , enable their phone 's @entity80 and press the relevant address from the app ( pictured right ) it works by letting users set triggers for events			1
for example , if someone opens the fridge door this triggers an event , such as making smart lights flash , or an alarm to sound			2
at the front of @entity11 ’s house was the august smart lock			1
fitted to the existing door lock , the battery - powered device is controlled by registered phones or tablets using the august app. to open the lock , anyone with a code can approach the door , enable their phone 's @entity80 and press the relevant address from the app. the lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired @entity80 device			1
it then confirms the visitor 's identity			0
@entity11 's @entity110 shows how almost anything in your house can either be controlled by a mobile , or be linked together			1
a tv that shows notifications , , smart lighting and a wine cooler with sensors is pictured in the futuristic kitchen this interactive image shows what sort of hi - tech devices could be used in your living room - and other rooms in a house of the future a circle of red dots on the front of the device will turn green and the august lock will twist to release the lock and open the door			1
to grant key-less access to friends the homeowner must send them an invite using @entity140 contacts or their phone 's address book			0
a smart security alarm , such as @entity144 ( pictured ) can be connected to smart lights from @entity40 here , @entity40 lights flash to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is an intruder in their home when someone enters or leaves the house a notification is sent to the owner and the lock automatically closes after 10 seconds to secure the door			1
the august device will be available from @entity42 for £ 119 ( $ 199 )			0
using @entity56 , this lock can then be connected to a smart smoke or security alarm , such as @entity163			1
when the alarm detects smoke , it triggers an event that is picked up by the lock			0
the lock then automatically opens to let people leave the house in a fire quickly			0
elsewhere , a smart security alarm , such as @entity144 , can be connected to smart lights from @entity40			2
the lights could then flash in the bedroom , for example , to silently alert homeowners to the fact there is an intruder downstairs			0
@entity144 will be available from july and costs £ 119 ( $ 199 )			0
the system can also be used for people with poor hearing			0
the smart @entity40 lights in @entity11 ’s demonstration ( pictured left ) were funded by a @entity187 campaign			2
they start at $ 89 ( £ 53 ) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on the spectrum using an app ( right ) @entity144 has a built - in hd video camera with night vision , microphone speakers to track changes in sound , temperature , air and humidity sensors , passive infrared motion detectors and a siren			2
the privacy settings can also be customised			0
for example , @entity144 can be ' armed ' at certain times of the day or week			0
the smart @entity40 lights in @entity11 ’s demonstration were funded by a @entity187 campaign			2
they start at $ 89 ( £ 53 ) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on the spectrum			0
this colour , and the light ’s brightness can then be controlled remotely using an app. for example , the lights could be turned pink for a girl ’s bedroom or blue for a boy			0
@entity11 used the @entity40 lights because they can be connected to any smart device running @entity56			1
for example , in the kitchen of @entity11 ’s @entity110 the @entity40 lights were linked to a smart wine cooler fitted with an @entity44 sensor , starting at £ 119 ( $ 199 )			1
elertus sensors can be fitted to almost any item in the house to detect changes in movement or temperature , for example			0
a home owner can keep tabs on alerts using an app ( left )			0
in the @entity238 ( right ) the sensor recognises when the wine cooler has been opened here , sensors alert the home owner that someone has opened the wine cooler in the kitchen elertus sensors can be fitted to almost any item in the house to detect changes in movement or temperature , for example			1
in the @entity238 the sensor recognises when the wine cooler has been opened			2
in the connected home demonstration , when the door was left open for more than five seconds , the @entity40 lights changed colour , and flashed – and these different triggers and events can be customised to make the wait shorter , or change the sequence of flashes			2
this @entity44 sensor can also be fitted to a fridge or freezer door , or a cookie jar for dieters			0
another use for the sensor is to send warnings and notifications to smart @entity267			0
in @entity11 ’s home a message was displayed in the corner of all tvs in the house when the wine cooler was opened			1
notifications were also sent when someone was at the door , via the august lock , or when someone in another room accessed the internet			0
child 's bedroom of the future			0
a network of devices , lights , clocks and even a smart teddy bear are connected to help a child wake up , or go to sleep an example of this was demonstrated in the child ’s bedroom of the mock - up house			1
if a parent puts a child to bed , but the child starts watching @entity301 on a phone , or starts playing a games console , a smart router alerts the parents , via a tv notification in another room that their child is still awake			0
the parents can then remotely shut off internet access to that room only			0
elsewhere in the child ’s bedroom , a network of devices , lights , clocks and even a smart teddy bear were connected to help a child wake up , or go to sleep			1
@entity11 demonstrated that at the touch of a button , an alarm clock can start ringing , the smart lights can slowly brighten and a teddy can say ‘ good morning ’ to the child			1
the teddy used in the home was a concept device ( pictured ) that can speak to children to wake them up , yet similar smart teddies are already on sale , such as @entity333 from @entity335 - based @entity334 this can be reversed when it ’s time to put the child to bed , and the teddy will instead say ‘ goodnight			1
' the teddy used in the home was a concept device , yet similar smart teddies are already on sale , such as @entity333 from @entity335 - based @entity334			1
by connecting smart clocks to the connected home , users could also reset the time in the spring and autumn , for daylight savings time in the @entity347 , all at once			2
alternatively , if there ’s a power cut , users can set all their smart clocks simultaneously			0
other examples seen in @entity11 ’s connected home tour included music systems in which different speakers were set at different volume levels and remotely - controlled air conditioning units that can also automatically adjust to temperature changes			1
this could all be used with @entity361 ’s smart blinds .			0

@entity11 showed off its vision of the @entity110 at @entity12 in @entity365
devices inside the home - from an intelligent wine cooler to a smart teddy - can be linked together and controlled using *smartphone* apps
all the products included are sold by individual companies , or have been developed by the @entity34 - based firm so they run @entity56 software
the house is secured by a phone - operated august smart lock and a camera connected to lights can alert home owners to intruders
