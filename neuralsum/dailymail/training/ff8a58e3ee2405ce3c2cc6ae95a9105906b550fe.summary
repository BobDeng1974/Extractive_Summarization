by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 is a name not many fans of @entity5 will recognise but the 53 - year - old is as low as 5/1 with some bookmakers to become the next manager at @entity9			1
it is believed he is back on the radar after talks last week and is a genuine option for @entity5 co-owner @entity14 despite being a relative unknown			0
because scratching a little deeper shows @entity2 has coaching credentials to rival the early career of @entity18 , and some of the big names in the @entity21 have been assisted by his guiding hand			1
who is he ? @entity2 has worked for @entity24 and @entity25 and is being considered for the vacant @entity5 job enough of all that – just who is he ? @entity2 is the international head coach at @entity25 sounds a little like @entity28 : @entity29			1
instead his role is to teach the coaches from the @entity33 across the globe , notably at soccer schools in @entity36 and @entity37			0
but before that he was in charge of @entity25 ’s successful youth team			2
tell me more … @entity2 originally joined @entity25 from @entity24 ’s academy in 2008 and assisted @entity43 on the side ’s run to that year 's @entity47 final			1
he took over when @entity43 moved up to become assistant to @entity49 ( then @entity50 ) and then oversaw the development of the likes of @entity53 and @entity54			0
what was his record like ? in his first full season in the job he brought the @entity47 to @entity59 for the first time since 1961 , beating @entity61 over two legs and then took over @entity64 ’s position as reserve team manager , incorporating the two roles			1
well done : @entity2 congratulates @entity68 captain @entity67 during a successful season in 2012/13 his team reached the @entity72 final , beating @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity24 beaten before losing to @entity61 in @entity76 , and last season he lifted the @entity77 by defeating @entity78 and @entity79			1
his career management record stands at 51 per cent			0
it is claimed he is the most decorated development coach in @entity25 ’s history , ahead of @entity83 , @entity43 , @entity64 and @entity84			2
all sound very impressive , has he any first - team experience ? yes			2
@entity87 has entrusted him with coaching duties during international breaks , with the likes of @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 under his guidance			0
trust : under @entity96 was left alone to coach the likes of @entity91 and @entity93 did he have any playing career himself ? indeed he did			0
he began at @entity24 aged 13 , playing in the same youth sides as @entity100 and @entity101 , later a league champion with @entity102 , but was released six years later			0
he moved to @entity103 in @entity104 and then went semi-professional at @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , retiring at 35			0
development : both @entity109 and @entity110 were coached by @entity2 in his time at @entity24 as an apprentice he had cleaned the boots of @entity114 , who by now was academy director at @entity24 and offered his former friend a job coaching the under - 16s			1
@entity2 would coach @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and more recently @entity110 and @entity109 .			2

@entity2 held talks with the club last week
53 - year - old is @entity25 's international head coach
@entity2 has never been a first team manager , but has coaching experience at *top* clubs *including* @entity24
coach is now rated at 5/1 by some bookmakers to get the job
