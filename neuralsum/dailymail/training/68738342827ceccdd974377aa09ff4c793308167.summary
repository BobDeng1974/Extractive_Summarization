@entity0 will wait until after the final game of the season to hand his report to @entity4 on the futures of club legends @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
the whereabouts of the long - serving trio next season remains in doubt with all three out of contract in the summer			0
' i do n't know but i do n't think so , ' said @entity0 when asked if @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity9 would play their final game for the club at @entity19 on sunday			1
' the club knows my opinion			0
the players centre of attention : @entity0 answers questions during his pre-match press conference uncertain future : @entity9 , @entity7 and @entity8 are all out of contract this summer @entity8 is in negotiations with the club and it is likely that after a formidable season he will be retained			1
but @entity9 's future , after limited action this term , is looking more likely to be away from @entity36			2
it is possible @entity7 , who is 36 in june , may have played his final match for @entity4 already			1
' @entity7 is ill , he is in bed , ' @entity0 said			2
asked to reflect on @entity7 's distinguished career at @entity36 , he added : ' maybe in a few years he will have a statue where @entity42 is			1
he 's one of the biggest players ( in the history ) of this club			0
' crowd favourite : @entity0 believes @entity7 deserves a statue in his honour when he leaves @entity4 @entity0 strangely described the defeat to @entity50 as the ' highlight ' of his first season back at @entity4 as he again hinted at where he felt his team 's @entity55 title chances had been extinguished			1
@entity0 was fined £ 10,000 on thursday for his sarcastic appraisal of officials following the loss to the @entity50 , and also failed in an appeal against an £ 8,000 penalty imposed after the defeat at @entity63			0
asked his standout moment of the campaign , he chose the penalty awarded by @entity67 and converted by @entity68 which earned @entity50 a 2 - 1 win on april 19 and ended @entity0 's 77 - match unbeaten home league run			2
case for the defence : @entity0 oversees @entity4 training as @entity9 runs through his paces on the ball : @entity78 tussles for possession with @entity80 as @entity4 train at their @entity83 base ' this season i lost a match at @entity36 for the first time , ' @entity0 said			1
' i lost with the second goal ( against @entity50 ) and for me that 's the highlight			0
' @entity0 declined to comment fully on @entity92 matters - his disciplinary sanctions or the findings of @entity96 's commission - but insisted he was happy to be back after a near six - year absence , despite his disciplinary troubles			2
' i like to be back , ' @entity0 added			0
' i do n't enjoy defeats , but i have to say that to lose at @entity101 is @entity103 football			0
' to lose like we did against @entity50 or @entity63 is not @entity103 football and i like @entity103 football , i do n't like what is n't @entity103 football			0
