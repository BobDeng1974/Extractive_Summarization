he blamed his alcohol problems on the breakdown of his marriage			2

his attorneys filed the chapter 7 petition late yesterday in federal bankruptcy court in @entity26 , @entity27 the filing comes weeks after an @entity30 commissioner authorized but did n't issue a bench warrant for @entity1 after he failed to appear in court in a case involving a $ 1.4 million debt			1
the 62 - year - old said his attorney agreed to change the date of a hearing , told him not to show up and then failed to reschedule			2
court documents show a default judgment ordered @entity1 to pay the @entity41 for office space he leased in @entity43			1
the agent said his debts are larger than the $ 1.4 million owed to the @entity41 , and that his attorneys are still compiling the total			1
he said his only assets are some stock			2
@entity1 began his career in 1975 has represented @entity8 stars such as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
he was the inspiration for @entity57 's character in 1996 's @entity10			2
the movie turned ' show me the money ! ' into an enduring catchphrase			2
success : former quarterbacks @entity53 , left , and @entity52 , right , with their one - time sports agent @entity1 at a party in 2006 art imitates life : @entity1 was the inspiration behind the 1996 movie @entity10 starring @entity57 and @entity70 @entity1 issued a statement shortly after the filing			1
he said he delayed filing for bankruptcy for several years ' because of my moral and legal obligation to people who advanced me funds or performed services in good faith			2
but the constant and aggressive collection efforts and press initiatives undertaken by creditors have harassed my family and prevented me from working to be able to pay these debts '			1
he said prospective clients have been pushed away after hearing of his debts			1
' it does n't seem logical to prevent a person who owes you money from working in their chosen field by attempting to ruin his reputation , but that is what has happened , ' he said			2
' i have lived with this in recent years , and it is time to follow a more constructive path			2
' @entity1 said he struggled with alcohol			1
in the past five or six years , ' i began to check out episodically for short periods			0
' my judgment and oversight of my affairs was not consistent and at times impaired			0
i am responsible for my own addiction — no one forced me to drink — and in revealing my struggle with alcoholism , i am in no way justifying or excusing my circumstance			0
recent : @entity1 was pictured with @entity112 at a 25th @entity113 on february 5 , 2011 in @entity114 , @entity115 @entity10 , right , based on @entity1 , turned the phrase ' show me the money ' into a popular catchphrase ' but i discuss it to provide context as well as understanding and inspiration to those who also battle addictive behavior			1
i surrendered to the reality that i was an alcoholic and my behavior was impacting family and associates in march 2010			0
' i surrendered to the concept that until i tackled alcoholism , other priorities needed to be put aside			0
... i am responsible for these debts			1
but my priority was sobriety , and i have been continuously sober since that time			0
' the agent said the underlying cause of his inability to earn money and resolve his debt situation occurred in 2003			0
' one of my employees admitted that — without my knowledge — he had taken a $ 300,000 loan from one of our @entity8 clients , ' @entity1 said in his statement			1
' it was exactly the kind of transaction that i had specifically forbidden , and it violated @entity151 regulations			0
' the @entity8 player understandably fired me , then went to a rival agency			0
as a matter of background , you should know that this company is run by an agent who used to work at our firm			0
fame : @entity1 has represented @entity8 stars such as @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and quarterback @entity54 , right , over his lengthy career ' we filed a lawsuit to challenge the way this agent had left our firm , and we won			1
two attorneys on the losing side are involved in the current case concerning my debt			0
' ten years ago , @entity1 had a bitter legal fight with former partner @entity173 , who took dozens of @entity8 player clients and formed his own agency			1
' since then , i have made repeated offers to repay the player far more than the original $ 300,000 , ' the statement continued			0
' there are many legal complexities , but in a nutshell , his representatives — the ones who lost the lawsuit — have insisted on collecting monies without informing the @entity151 that the matter is settled			1
' this point is crucial because i did not apply for recertification by the union after one of their agents ( and his wife ) filed suit against me in 2006			0
' if i can not be recertified , i can not work in the field that i have been trained in , which is to the benefit of this rival agent			0
' keeping me out of business seems to be a priority above collecting the debt , and although substantial payments have been made , the demand is now four times the original amount			0
my attempts to rebuild my life have been hamstrung			0
' i have attempted to make amends for damage my drinking caused to others			0
i believe that i have many productive years ahead and hope through this process that once again i will be able to make a positive impact on athletes and the world			0
