more than 200,000 vehicles damaged or destroyed by the monster storm 3,300 towed by @entity3 authorities during the cleanup 535 still unclaimed and to be auctioned in may prices start at $ 300 but may not actually be able to be driven by @entity6 published : 10:03 est , 21 april 2013 updated : 13:37 est , 21 april 2013 when @entity8 struck @entity3 last october thousands of cars were either damaged or abandoned in the storm			1
in the days that followed , more than 3,000 were towed from emergency routes for street cleaning			1
city officials estimate more than 500 @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 's remain unclaimed			2
now the city is auctioning these ' flood - damaged but may be salvageable ' vehicles			1
submerged but salvageable : cars that were abandoned or damaged by @entity8 are to be sold at auction next @entity22 owners decided not to claim them after the destructive storm the storm which swamped lower @entity25 and destroyed beachfront communities including the @entity27 in @entity28			1
the storm surge saw many cars drift down the street several blocks from where they were parked			2
some landed on front lawns , inside homes or under trees			0
an estimated 230,000 vehicles in the region were damaged or destroyed by @entity8 , according to insurance industry estimates			1
iconic : images such as this one of a taxi garage in @entity28 , @entity3 became symbolic of the destruction and disruptions to daily life that @entity8 created with so many unclaimed cars to deal with the city set up a telephone hotline for owners to pick up their posessions			1
technically , under state law , unclaimed cars can be sold after 10 days			2
owners , lien holders and insurance companies were notified			0
records were also checked at the @entity57			0
as of january , 696 vehicles were unclaimed but this weekend there are now 535 unclaimed vehicles that are set to be auctioned next month			1
there are some potentially good deals to be had with prices as low as $ 300			1
pile of junk : usually when cars become submerged under water as in this street in @entity70 , @entity71 their engines are ruined ... but you never know ! bargain hunting buyers would have to be prepared to take a gamble however because not only do the cars hot have keys , the vehicles ca n't be registered for road use without an inspection			2
in some cases they may only be useful for spare parts			0
the website of the auctioneer @entity85 in @entity86 on @entity87 states there are passenger cars luxury cars , classic cars , vans , suvs , 4x4s , sport cars and pickup trucks available			0
' we ’ve sold one as low as $ 300 and we had one above $ 10,000 , ' said auctioneer @entity98 to the @entity100			1
' just because a vehicle is titled as flood - damaged does n’t mean it ’s inoperable			2
to some degree , it ’s a gamble , ' not going anywhere : parked cars are partially submerged in flood waters in the aftermath of @entity8 in @entity3 october 30th 2012 there are some risks : usually when salt water gets into the engine the car is going nowhere but the scrap heap			1
@entity115 can ruin computer - controlled fuel and braking systems , heating and air - conditioning			0
@entity120 did n't reach the engines in all cases which means there is a glimmer of hope for any buyer			0
buyers need to bring 25 per cent of the deposit in cash or a bank cheque			0
the auctions will be held , on may 2 and 7 with the proceeds going into city funds and 10 per cent to the auctioneer			0
city officials have said that they will work with owners if they suddenly realise their cars are at the auction house .			0
