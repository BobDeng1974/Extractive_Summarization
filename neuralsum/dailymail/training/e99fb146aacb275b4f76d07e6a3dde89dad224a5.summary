lingering suspicion directed at the captain of missing flight @entity2 has today lifted , as @entity4 investigators reveal they found ' nothing sinister ' on his home - built flight simulator			1
officials in @entity10 declared that @entity12 police and the @entity4 's technical experts have found nothing to suggest captain @entity2 was planning to hijack the flight after closely examining his flight simulator			1
police who raided the 53 - year - old 's house in a wealthy part of @entity10 seized the simulator , taking it apart piece by piece , to examine its hard drive for clues			1
suspicious : the captain of the missing airline @entity2 , @entity2 , has been dubbed the ' chief suspect ' in @entity30 's official police investigation into the incident the criminal inquiry cleared all the intelligence checks completed for all the people on board the flight to @entity37 via @entity10			2
the only individual arousing suspicion was @entity38 the probe revealed that logs had been deleted on february 3			0
it meant records of what captain @entity2 had been up to on the simulator prior to that date had been erased			0
experts who have anaylsed the programme , successfully extracting vital flight and technique records , are said to have found nothing to raise suspicion			0
' as far as i know , there is nothing sinister on the simulator but of course that will have to be confirmed by the chief of police , ' mr @entity52 , @entity30 's defence minister and acting minister of transport , said in @entity10 today			1
he made the dramatic revelation at a briefing after meeting relatives of the @entity68 's passengers , most of whom were @entity69			0
the father - of - three ( left ) had made no social or work - related plans for the future , unlike the rest of the crew			0
@entity30 police were also told of rumours that he was experiencing tensions with some family members @entity30 defence minister @entity79 told reporters : ' as far as i know , there is nothing sinister on the simulator but of course that will have to be confirmed by the chief of police ' until the revelation , suspicion had lingered over the pilot			1
had he practiced landing on a remote airfield where he intended to take @entity2 ? had he tried sending a make - believe aircraft on a crazy joy ride , taking it up to 45,000ft and then putting it into a plunge ? those were the questions that many were asking about his activities on the simulator , but the @entity4 has concluded he was up to nothing suspicious			2
the lessening of the pilot 's complicity in the fate of the aircraft is now expected to focus on the jet experiencing a major catastrophic event which forced captain @entity2 and his 27 - year - old co-pilot @entity2 to turn it around from its @entity10 - @entity37 route and head west to the nearest airfield			1
however , some experts believe that smoke , depressurisation or some other disaster had rendered the pilots incapable of controlling the aircraft and auto - pilot had taken it out into the @entity117			2
mr @entity52 said police would clarify the results of the examination of the simulator very soon , as investigations continue with international agencies into all aspects of the aircraft 's disappearance .			0
