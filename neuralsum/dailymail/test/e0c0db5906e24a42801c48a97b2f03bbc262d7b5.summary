saved : dozens of migrants are brought ashore at @entity23 harbor in @entity24 after they were rescued from a shipwreck which killed 400 others the trauma of their ordeal is clear to see as the @entity30 migrants wait to be assess by medics after disembarking from their coastguard vessel survivors told charity workers that as many as 400 others perished and @entity24 coastguards said today that no more had been found alive the commercial ship was unaware of the unfolding disaster and went on its journey , leaving men , women and children in the water before an @entity24 naval vessel arrived at the site some 80 miles south of the island of @entity46			1
dazed , scared and exhausted survivors , including several children , were taken to @entity46 and ports in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			0

’ the death toll is the largest in the region since october 2013 and came as 42 boats , coming mainly from @entity88 and @entity89 and carrying 5,110 migrants – including 317 unaccompanied children – were rescued in just 48 hours trying to make the hazardous crossing to @entity93			1
perilous journey : in a tragic twist , the boat appears to have overturned because of the excitement caused by the sighting of rescuers lucky few : coastguard spokesman @entity101 said they had not found any more ' survivors or anything else to indicate more victims ' @entity106 - shocked : a man is escorted by an @entity24 financial police from the tanker @entity110 at the port of @entity23 as the survivors were brought ashore , @entity112 accused the @entity114 for scrapping rescue operations in the @entity2 health checks : rescued men , women and children are processed after arriving at the southern @entity24 port of @entity23 in @entity24 the disaster has focused attention on the controversial decision to stop @entity24 naval patrols – which last year rescued 170,000 migrants – and replace them with a smaller @entity93 policing and surveillance mission			1
yesterday the @entity128 - based @entity129 called on the leaders of @entity128 political parties to commit to ‘ restart the rescue ’ operations			2
@entity129 chief executive @entity134 said : ‘ our political leaders can not ignore the fact that without search and rescue we are allowing thousands of innocent children and their families to drown off the coast of @entity93			1
‘ how many thousands must die this summer before @entity93 acts ? ’ recent good weather in the @entity2 and renewed violence in @entity88 have prompted a big increase in the numbers trying to reach @entity24			1

i saw people cut off the heads of @entity165 people			0
’ officials say the disaster has taken the number of migrants lost at sea in the area this year to 900 , compared with 17 in the same period last year			0
an increasingly violent and chaotic situation in @entity88 has added to the problem , with unpoliced ports allowing people smugglers a free hand @entity24 @entity178 operators give first aid to immigrants as they arrive in the @entity24 port of @entity182 in @entity50			1
@entity24 coastguards intercepted 42 boats on april 12 and 13 , carrying 6,500 migrants attempting to make the hazardous crossing to @entity93 recent good weather has prompted a spike in the number of migrants attempting to reach @entity24 , many of them on overcrowded vessels			1
