we all enjoy a good wedding but @entity2 loves them so much she 's decided to make a living out of the special day - as the world 's first professional bridesmaid			1
the 26 - year - old came up with the idea after taking on the duty at all her friends ' weddings			1
and she proved so good at it , she decided to offer up her services to strangers			1
@entity15 @entity2 made the unusual decision to become a professional bridesmaid after performing the duty three times for friends and family @entity2 , pictured left , performs bridesmaid duties at the wedding of good friend @entity25 in @entity15 @entity2 , who promises she can get guests off their seats , shows off her dance moves at the wedding of friend @entity30 in @entity31 @entity2 ( @entity32 from right ) , pictured at the wedding of friend @entity30 , will also arrange bridal showers and hen parties as part of her professional bridesmaid service for a small fee , @entity2 promises to get guests dancing as well as help write the speeches			1
she 'll even lift the bride 's dress when she needs to go the loo			2
' i 've always loved weddings and i love being a part of them , ' says @entity2 , from @entity15			1
' my favourite thing is watching the bride walk down the aisle			0
it 's the moment she 's been building up to over a mad year of planning , rehearsals , the bridal shower and the hen do			0
' it 's such a lovely moment and it 's such a wonderful feeling to be part of that			0
' she adds : ' i think there 's something so special about two people promising to spend their lives together - i love witnessing that first hand			0
' she also has an ulterior motive - she 's keen to find a groom of her own			2
she hopes that attending more weddings will increase her chance of finding mr @entity72 - much to the delight of her mother			1
' i 'm always trying to catch the bouquet , " she says			0
' i am quite shy with guys and i 've never been close to going down the aisle myself			0
' my mum says i 'll be able to meet eligible groomsmen at all these weddings and she 's thrilled			2
' @entity2 , right getting ready to be bridesmaid at a friend 's wedding in @entity31 , says she hopes attending lots of wedding will increase her own chances of finding mr @entity72 @entity2 started by advertising her services on classified website @entity88			1
and within a just a few hours she was inundated with messages			0
' i said i could help carry the bride 's dress and lift it when she needs to do things like go to the bathroom , ' explains @entity2			1
' my services also included filling the dance floor as well as planning the hen do and the bridal shower			2
' right after i posted the ad my inbox blew up and it was crazy			0
' i received responses from women in the @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			1
' @entity2 admits she was taken aback by the huge demand			1
' there were so many reasons for having a professional bridesmaid , ' she explains			2
' some said their friends were n't very good at helping to plan the big day , others said their best friends were too far away to come to their wedding			2
' some people just did n't have any close friends			0
' @entity2 , here hugging a friend at the wedding of friend @entity30 , has already received responses from women in the @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 she adds : ' i was pretty shocked - i thought people would think i was crazy but women seem to really like the idea			1
' it 's the men who think i 'm mad			0
they do n't really know what goes in to being a bridesmaid and what hard work it actually is but i hope this will educate them			2
' @entity2 has yet to put a price on a day of her bridesmaid services @entity2 , who has been a bridesmaid three times for friends and family , currently has two weddings booked in september this year with total strangers in @entity15 who are paying her expenses - including travel and the dress			1
but she is yet to set a price for a day of bridesmaid duties			1
she says : ' it 's all a matter of what the budget is and what the couple can pay me			0
' i do n't think having a professional bridesmaid should necessarily be expensive and i want to be able to work with all sorts of budgets			0
" as business booms , her surreal line of work has been compared to @entity162 film , 27 dresses , where actress @entity164 plays a wedding nut			0
' a lot of people say my life is very much like the film , " she says			0
' my wardrobe is pretty full at the moment but i can see it being overrun with bridesmaid dresses in all colours and shapes			0
' and , like the film , @entity2 hopes her story will have a happy ending too in the form of a wedding of her own			1
