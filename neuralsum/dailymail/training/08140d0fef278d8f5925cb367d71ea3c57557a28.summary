it is a growing health issue that threatens to trigger cancer , diabetes and heart disease			1
sitting for longer than four hours a day increases a person 's chance of suffering chronic disease			1
now , inspired to address the lack of physical activity in modern work life , one @entity8 designer believes he might have created the answer			1
with just two legs , the ' @entity14 ' chair relies on the user engaging the muscles in their core to keep it upright			1
@entity20 , the man behind the creation , said he wanted to encourage movement for those office workers who spent around 70 per cent of the day sitting down			1
@entity8 designer @entity20 said he was inspired to combat physical inactivity the chair creates a slight discomfort , as the user has to keep shifting position to keep it stable			1
it passively stimulates other parts of the body , in a similar way to an exercise ball , forcing the user to have better posture			0
the chair is not meant to be sat in for long periods , just a couple of hours at a time			2
mr @entity20 worked with ergonomists and physical therapists to refine the structure , which took nine months to research and develop			2
when the chair is not being used , it has to be propped against a wall or table			0
and despite looking risky , the design prevents people from falling while using it			1
' our living spaces are conceived with the idea of time - saving and cutting down on physical activity , ' said mr @entity20			1
' stationary behaviour is so common now , most people have little physical activity during the day			1
' people watch a lot of tv and work on computers and many people suffer from spine and muscular problems because of this stationary behaviour			0
' companies are coming up with products to make our lives easier , such as autonomous vacuum cleaners or other domestic robots , but trying to offer consumers an easier life creates lots of health problems			0
mr @entity20 worked with ergonomists and physical therapists to refine the structure , which took nine months to research and develop a study published last year found those office workers who spend more than four hours a day sitting down are at greater risk of chronic illnesses , including cancer , diabetes and heart disease			1
those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes			2
the research involved 63,048 middle - aged men but @entity95 scientists said the findings are likely to also apply to women			0
professor @entity98 , who led the study at @entity100 , said the more people sat , the bigger the health problems			2
he said ‘ we saw a steady stair - step increase in risk of chronic diseases the more participants sat. ‘ the group sitting more than eight hours clearly had the highest risk			2
’ the latest study follows research in 2012 on 222,000 people which found sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within three years , even among the physically active			1
' our houses are becoming more and more comfortable and people would not imagine a house built with the idea of discomfort			0
' but discomfort can put the body in motion and out of its chronic stationary posture			0
' the chair is an important part of your life , as most of us stay sitting for more than 70 per cent of the day			2
' the challenge of the chair was to propose a product which tried to encourage movement			0
' i wanted to design a chair that had a visual impact but was also efficient on the human body			0
' the structure of the chair was designed in order to prevent people falling out - the legs have been inclined 12 degrees relative to the vertical axis and the height of the back was designed to help prevent it			1
' at the moment , the chair is a unique piece			0
i did n't design it to be sold by a furniture brand and mass produced			0
' design is not just about filling a gap in the market , the practice of design can be used to make people think about ourselves to change our behaviours			0
' i hope it will encourage people to try to be more active			0

the ' @entity14 ' chair aims to encourage the user to move at their desk
@entity8 designer @entity20 was inspired to address the lack of physical activity after discovering office workers spend 70 *%* of the day sitting down
the chair has just two legs and requires the user to *balance* it
despite looking risky , the design prevents people from falling while using it
study found sitting for longer than four hours increases a person 's risk of chronic illness , including cancer , diabetes and heart disease
