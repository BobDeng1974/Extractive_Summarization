according to a @entity18 page which updates their followers @entity7 and @entity8 , from @entity1 , flew to see a specialist surgeon in @entity10 yesterday following a meeting with their doctor about their two sets of identical twins the family posted this message to their @entity18 today after the successful surgery the couple also found out that @entity7 's cervix is opening prematurely as a result of the condition			1
@entity7 underwent surgery today and was given ' meds to halt any contraction that might occur			1
' a few hours later the anxious family revealed the surgery went well			2
they posted on @entity18 : ' it went great			0
dr. @entity58 smiled and said , " this has been a good day ! " our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued ' baking ' for a good long time ! ! stunned : this is the moment @entity7 and @entity8 , for @entity1 , found out they were having quadruplets in the summer after spending eight years trying to conceive			2
above , mrs @entity29 stares at the screen in the ultrasound 70 - million - to - one odds : the couple were delighted to learn their first round of @entity73 was successful in july following a long battle with infertility			1
but they were later stunned to discover they were having four babies caught on camera : their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by friend @entity84 twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins ’ shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other			1
it affects approximately 15 % of identical twins who share the same placenta			1
one twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta			2
this can put a strain on the baby ’s heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal , resulting in extra fluid around the baby , within the amniotic sac			0
this can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb ( cervix )			0
the other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta			2
the treatments for @entity24 pregnancies depend , in part , on when in pregnancy the twins become affected			2
if the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb ( beyond 25 weeks ) , immediate delivery is an option for @entity24 babies			2
fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other			1
another treatment is amnioreduction - a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery			2
a needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed			0

they then posted : ' the doctor just came out and said the babies are cured of twin to twin transfusion ... he said that part could n't have gone better ! ! !
