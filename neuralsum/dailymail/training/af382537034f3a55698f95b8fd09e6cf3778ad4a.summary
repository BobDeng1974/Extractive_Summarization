they were each jailed for two years by a judge sitting at @entity21 , who said they had committed a ' cruel , callous , despicable crime '			1

@entity33 footage played at the hearing showed the teenager 's fall			2
@entity6 and @entity37 , who had been a guest at the flat , could then be seen coming out to the scene and crouching over him			1
@entity37 took the items and handed them to @entity6 , which meant emergency services were unable to identify mr @entity11 when they arrived to treat him			1
the teenager was taken to hospital , where he underwent emergency surgery for life - threatening injuries			2
the court heard that it was unclear why he had fallen , but injuries to his neck were consistent with knife wounds			0
plunge : the block of flats on @entity55 in @entity31 , where teenager @entity11 suffered multiple injuries in a fall @entity6 , who had 90 previous connections , was arrested along with @entity37 and three others on suspicion of attempted murder			1
all five were later charged with conspiracy to rob , but @entity6 and @entity37 pleaded guilty to a less serious offence of theft			2
charges were dropped against the other three defendants			0
judge @entity65 said that mr @entity11 , from @entity66 , had had ' his young life wrecked by these events '			1

the judge told the thieves : ' shortly after 4am mr @entity11 fell from the window of the flat to the pavement outside sustaining dreadful injuries			1
remarks : judge @entity79 said it was a ' cruel , callous and despicable crime ' ' as i speak he has no recollection of what caused him to fall and the other occupants of the flat have chosen not to reveal what happened			0
' i sentence you on the basis that you played no part in causing him to fall from that window ... ... what you did was bad enough because you went outside to the street where he lay gravely injured and after making only the most perfunctory attempts to summon help you went through his clothing and stole his wallet and phone			0
' it was a cruel , callous and despicable crime in which you both played an equal part			0
' one result was the removal of the only means of identification carried by your victim which meant the police and medical authorities were unable to notify his family			0
' his relatives suffered hours of agony and distress and were unable to make contact and having no idea what had happened			0
' the judge added that , but for the thieves ' actions , mr @entity11 's family could have been at his bedside			1
' his family may have had the comfort of knowing where he was and that he was in capable hands , ' the judge said			0
' you caused untold anguish to his family by removing any means of identifying him and that makes it a particularly serious offence			0
' @entity135 , prosecuting , told the court that mr @entity11 went out on july 5 with two friends and they spent the evening socialising at various bars in the city centre			1
he became separated from his friends and when one rang him at 2.24am he said he was with a woman near @entity143			0
when contacted again 15 minutes later , he said he was at ' some girl ’s house '			0
@entity33 footage later revealed he had gone into the block of flats with a woman called @entity150 at 2.25am			0
he fell out of the window at 4.06am			0
@entity6 and @entity37 appeared within minutes and , after crouching over his body , @entity37 was seen to pass the victim ’s wallet and @entity8 to @entity6			2
after checking through the wallet , @entity6 went back into the flat with the items			1
he disposed of the wallet in a bin area shortly afterwards			0
' you caused untold anguish to his family by removing any means of identifying him and that makes it a particularly serious offence			0
' - judge @entity65 mr @entity135 said that a passer - by who saw @entity6 standing near mr @entity11 had described the thief as seeming ' not bothered '			1
@entity6 later suggested to police that mr @entity11 had jumped from the window of his own accord			1
while mr @entity11 's family were reporting him missing , police were urging the defendants to tell them who the injured man was			1
officers found the teenager 's wallet in the bin area and the @entity8 hidden in the flat			2
@entity181 , defending @entity37 , told the court that a situation had developed between the victim and one of the men present - not @entity6 - and the teenager had ended up on the window ledge			1
' @entity6 has described to police how @entity5 had attempted to get hold of @entity11 and bring him back into the flat and was unfortunately not successful and shortly after he fell from the window , ' ms @entity181 said			1
@entity194 , for @entity6 , said that his client had been a heroin user but had kept out of trouble since his last prison sentence in 2009			2
he told the hearing that @entity6 went outside after mr @entity11 fell to see what had happened and had gone over the road to a cafe to ask for the emergency services to be called			1
' what happened thereafter was truly appalling , ' the barrister continued , ' but he did not initiate the decision to take the wallet and phone			0
' justice : @entity37 , 30 , and @entity6 , 45 , were each given two - year jail sentences by a judge sitting at @entity21 ( pictured ) in a statement after the sentencing hearing , mr @entity11 's parents @entity211 and @entity213 said : ' @entity11 was a normal fun loving 19 - year - old when this incident occurred and is a very much - loved member of a close family			1
' he was looking forward to going to @entity71 to study biological sciences prior to this incident			2
' at the time @entity11 was robbed he was in a critical condition on the ground and the people that carried out the theft would have known this			2
' at a time when everybody deserves all the help and support possible these individuals were driven by their own greed			0
' they would have realised @entity11 was seriously injured and needed urgent medical attention			2
their act of theft was callous			0
' the parents said that mr @entity11 had suffered ' life - changing injuries ' and now required help to do things that many take for granted			1
' his treatment is ongoing and the full extent of his injuries will not be known for sometime , ' they said			0
' we acknowledge the sentencing today but no sentence will be long enough for these people			0
