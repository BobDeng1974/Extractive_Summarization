they say that pets become more and more like their owners as time goes by			1
so it should come as no surprise then that , like his master , @entity7 the @entity6 cat is himself fond of a little ‘ chillaxing ’ now and then			1
and on a day when @entity12 basked in the hottest day of the year so far , with temperatures reaching a sizzling 27c ( 81f ) , who could blame him			1
taking it easy : @entity7 the @entity6 had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now stretched out in the @entity22 sun the brown and white tabby slumped down on his side and took a well - deserved cat nap just a few feet from the door of @entity27			1
@entity7 , a rescue cat from @entity29 , was given the title of @entity31 to the @entity32 and was chosen by @entity6 staff to tackle a growing rat problem last year			1
but since his arrival he appears to lack the killer instinct and instead of boasting an impressive kill ratio @entity7 has become better known for his ... sleeping			1
he may not have to worry about the eurozone crisis or hauling @entity12 out of recession , but that did n't stop @entity7 seemingly neglecting his rat catching duties when he soaked up the sun yesterday			1
is @entity44 too ' chillaxed ' to run the country ? is @entity44 too ' chillaxed ' to run the country ? now share your opinion @entity44 attracted some criticism for his own ' chillaxing ' last week following claims in a biography that he spends weekends at @entity53 singing karaoke , playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘ @entity57 ’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch			1
his latest afternoon snooze came as @entity12 baked			2
after the wettest april on record and perhaps the coldest start to may in 70 years the mercury is finally beginning to move in the right direction			2
sunseekers poured onto the country ’s beaches whilst others headed into the garden for a spot of sunbathing			2
creature comforts : @entity7 , pictured last year , appears to enjoy a cat nap as much as any other feline those at the @entity76 were left wilting whilst one man and his dinghy floated out to sea in @entity80 sparking a major rescue operation			2
incredibly @entity12 was hotter than parts of @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and the @entity86			2
it also left most of the @entity88 in the shade			2
and the temperature is expected to rise even further today ( thurs )			2
forecasters said it could reach up to 28c ( xxf ) in the south and south east - and best of all , the glorious sunshine and blue skies are here to stay for at least a fortnight			0
@entity99 forecaster @entity98 said : ‘ it is bikini and ice cream weather for almost the whole country			0
distracted : the preoccupied prime minister attracted criticism for his supposed ' chillaxing ' style when pictured watching the end of the @entity109 final running talks : earlier in this week 's @entity112 talks at @entity113 , mr @entity44 and president @entity114 staged a 35 - minute ' treadmill summit ' side by side at the gym ‘ pretty much everywhere has temperatures in the @entity119 and wall - to - wall sunshine			1
‘ in recent weeks we had low pressure over or close to the @entity12 , bringing rain and cold temperatures			0
‘ over the last couple of days , that has given way to high pressure , sunny weather and rising temperatures from the @entity131			0
’ at 26.9c ( 80.4f ) yesterday ( wed ) was the hottest day of the year , but it is expected to get even hotter today ( thurs )			0
it will be 28c and sunny in @entity136			0
summer sun : @entity7 's sunbathing session came as the rest of the @entity12 enjoyed a gloriously hot may , including here in @entity141 , @entity142 , where temperatures reached @entity144 basking : @entity146 , 18 , and @entity147 , 21 , were just two of the many people who enjoyed the sun in @entity141 , which posted the hottest temperatures of the year in the @entity12 yesterday bizarrely , the highest temperature was not recorded in the south but in the @entity142 ski resort of @entity141			0
it also hit 26.9c ( 80.4f ) at @entity136 ’s @entity155 , 25.9c ( 78.6f ) on @entity157 ’s beaches and 25.6c ( 78.1f ) in @entity136 ’s @entity158			0
supermarkets reported a surge in sales of sausages , burgers and summer tipple pimms as well as picnic treats such as pork pies			0
five million sausages - 70 per cent more than normal - are expected to fly off supermarket shelves over the weekend as the country makes the most of the mini heatwave			0
not the only one : @entity7 the cat was one of many who decided to kick back yesterday , including angler @entity174 in the @entity176 @entity177 also predicts it will sell one million burgers , half a million bags of salad - 20 per cent more than in a normal week - as well as a 115 per cent increase in burger bun sales			1
@entity183 , @entity177 ’s head of fresh food supply , said : ‘ we have already seen rising sales throughout the week of typical bbq fare such as burgers and sausages but with the mini heatwave expected to continue into the weekend , we ’re expecting it to be one of the biggest we ’ve ever seen for barbecue foods			1
’ only days ago the country endured temperatures up to 4c colder than the average for this time of year			1
ironically , the sweltering weather comes amid a relaxation of the hosepipe ban which was imposed by seven water companies on april 5 after months of drought only for it to rain almost non-stop for the rest of the month			0
meanwhile , the arrival of the sun saw betting firm @entity205 slash the odds of the temperature soaring past 39c ( 103f ) during the jubilee weekend from 20/1 to just 8/1			0
@entity209 of @entity205 said : ‘ it finally looks like summer has arrived , and the odds suggest the jubilee weekend could be a scorcher			0

@entity44 attracted criticism this week over claims he spends too much time on *leisure* *activities*
