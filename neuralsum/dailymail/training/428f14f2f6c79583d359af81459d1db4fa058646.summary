@entity0 : the new chairman of the @entity2 , pictured , has warned the corporation not to become too ' high and mighty ' the new chairman of the @entity2 has warned the corporation not to become too ' high and mighty ' , and distanced herself from her predecessors by promising she wo n't ' gloss over ' its faults			1
@entity8 used her first speech as chairman of the @entity2 's governing body to urge television bosses to ' challenge themselves ' , and warned them that she would not become the @entity15 's ' cheerleader '			1
' i 'm not someone to gloss over the @entity2 's faults , problems or challenges – i see it as part of my job to identify and pursue them , ' she said			1
in doing so , the 53 - year old executive distanced herself from her predecessors @entity26 and sir @entity28 , who were accused of being too ' cosy ' with the @entity2 's executives and becoming blind to the @entity15 's faults			1
mrs @entity31 also admitted in her inaugural address that the @entity15 needs to become more ' agile ' , and vowed to consult the public on what shape it should take in the future , rather than leaving decisions to a ' small elite '			0
' [ there needs to be ] a very real debate about the future , size and shape of the @entity2 …			1
and i believe it needs to be a proper public debate , not one conducted by a small elite , ' she said			0
' the debate must include the voices of all the people out there who pay for the @entity2 , who love its programmes , who are its true owners			2
' mrs @entity31 's comments come as the @entity2 prepares for its next @entity54 , in 2016 , when the corporation will effectively negotiate its future funding			1
@entity2 acolytes insist that the corporation must be kept intact			1
however , many of the @entity2 's critics have argued that it should be shrunk , for example by cutting back on its in - house production unit or local news services			1
mrs @entity31 , who was finance director of @entity64 before she joined the @entity2 , admitted that the @entity15 may need to shrink but added that it does not need to become ' much ' smaller			2
however , she used a story about her son to warn the @entity15 not to become too complacent			0
she told television executives in @entity68 that she had once returned home from a conference ' feeling rather pleased ' with herself , only to see he had loaded a screen - saver onto her computer , with the slogan : ' high and mighty			0
just because you 're at the top does n't mean you 're useful '			0
' it was a good challenge			0
everyone – and i include in that every organisation – needs to challenge itself from time to time			0
and because the @entity2 is paid for by the public , that challenge needs to take form of a wider debate , ' she said			2
predecessors : @entity26 , left , and sir @entity28 were accused of being too cosy with @entity2 executives she added that the @entity2 should do more to cooperate with other media groups , for example by sharing content			1
' the @entity2 has to show that it can be more open and collaborative – while respecting its editorial position			2
it should do more sharing of ip and content , get better at linking and attribution , ' she said			0
' clearly the @entity2 is a major market intervention and , while it needs to serve all licence fee payers , it also needs to be sensitive to commercial players operating in the @entity98 market			2
' in recent years , the @entity2 has come under heavy fire over its free - to - access local news websites , which have helped to accelerate the decline of commercially run newspaper operations in those areas			0
' we need a vibrant press as part of a healthy democracy and the public deserve a choice of providers , ' mrs @entity31 said .			0
