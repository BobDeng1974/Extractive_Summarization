by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:10 est , 24 february 2014 ' if you do n’t want to settle for anything less than perfect then the @entity3 is for you ’ , a sultry voiceover informs prospective customers in a video advertising a new controversial dating website			2
the @entity3 , which started in @entity10 and has spread across @entity11 and @entity12 has just launched here in the @entity14 to a rather mixed response			1
while the club insists it is receiving growing levels of interest in @entity14 , opponents have branded the club – which pairs rich men with women rated purely on their looks - as an example of chauvinistic objectification			1
the @entity3 has spread across @entity11 and @entity12 has just launched here in the @entity14 to a rather mixed response women who join up have to meet the strict looks criteria of a panel of twenty ' experts ' and submit 3 photographs - including a full body shot - from which they are given a rating out of 100 started in 2010 in @entity37 , the site was started by serial entrepreneur @entity38 , 33 , whose aim was to introduce a new high - end dating concept			1
he believes the world ’s richest men often do n’t have the time to search for love , but nor do they want to lose control of the dating process and be match - made			2
and @entity38 has a rather controversial reason for his decision to launch in the @entity14 , claiming rich @entity14 men ca n't find love as the women here are unattractive			1
he told @entity53 : ' coming from a @entity55 country we know @entity14 as a country of ugly women			1
‘ there are a lot of a wealthy men here but the women are not very attractive and it is difficult for the men to meet good looking women			2
founder , @entity38 , left says @entity14 women are ' unattractive ' so men with money ca n't find suitable dates here men are not submitted to any questions when they attempt to join the site , only to provide an email address and informed about pricing ‘ we already have over 30 millionaires members from @entity37 and across @entity11 and we ’re now signing up the @entity14 ’s most eligible and wealthy men			1
‘ these types of men may not have a lot of time on their hands , but they do n’t want a control freak matchmaker telling them who and where to date			0
they want to feel free to make the perfect choice themselves			0
’ costing up to $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) a year for men to join , the site already boasts a raft of millionaire businessmen , from ‘ @entity11 tennis players to self - made millionaire internet entrepreneurs			1
’ women can join the site for considerably less , however they do have to meet the strict looks criteria of a panel of twenty ‘ experts ’ and submit three photographs - including a full body shot			2
male members can sort women how they wish , as well as filtering women so they only ever see women above a certain rating women pay up to £ 30 a year for one year ’s membership to the site , depending on the rating they are given by the panel form 1 - 100 ( 100 being the best ) , which is calculated based on their photographs , but adjusted according to their age and the other women at the club they join			1
male members are able to buy memberships for multiple clubs , choosing from a single club ( $ 10,000 or about £ 6,000 a year ) , a ‘ region ’ such as @entity12 or @entity11 which gives access to all the clubs in that area ( $ 50,000 or about £ 30,000 ) or global membership , which at a $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) , gives a man free reign to look at and contact all the women signed up to any club in the world			1
men can pay for various levels of membership , giving them access to the women in one to all of the clubs across the world women however can only sign up for one club			1
for example women living in @entity140 would sign up for the @entity141 , and their rating is calculated in comparison to others signed up to that club			2
so in a club full of stunning women , your rating is likely to be lower			2
women 's rating also affects how much they pay for membership ; the lower your rating , the more you pay			1
any non-physical factors such as interests or level of education are not taken into account , and men can filter the women they view based on rating , with many opting not be visible to , or view themselves , any women who scored less than 90			1
@entity38 , 33 , says that appearance is ultimately the most important thing to men @entity38 says he was inspired to start the business because he saw a gap in the online dating market			0
‘ i noticed on another dating website that the men were n’t necessarily physically attractive and that those men who were standing in a suit were rated higher			2
‘ i concluded that women were n’t interested in looks and were instead interested in other factors - namely financial success			0
‘ although other sites for millionaire men exist , they only charged £ 10 a month for membership so what i found is most of the men on there were not in fact rich and were often dubious or weirdos			1
i figured if a man really has a lot of money , he will be willing to pay			0
’ unsurprisingly , this view of the world , where men are purely driven in their romantic endeavours by ascetic factors , and women ’s affections motivated by money , has been challenged by many			0
‘ the site just mirrors society			0
it is a truth that men like good looking women , it is very very important to them , ’ @entity38 says			0
‘ @entity205 girls do n’t like the site and poor guys do n’t like it			0
they do n’t want to admit that guys prefer beautiful women and women want rich successful men			1
‘ the ugly girls create this moral concept around the idea ; attempt to moralise the website			0
but if you speak to any evolutionary psychologist they will tell you this is the way we evolved as a species			0
@entity38 admits a woman ’s personality does come into play in romantic pairings , but only once a certain level of beauty had been satisfied			0
‘ it ( appearance ) is a very very important thing for men			0
‘ it is a lower boundary , and then on top of this you need personality and compatibility			0
but looks are the first sorting mechanism , especially in internet dating			0
’ when asked if a man would ever date an ugly girl based on her good personality , @entity38 ’s answer was resolute : ‘ no. no i do n’t think so			2

@entity3 has just launched in @entity14
aims to pair millionaire men with beautiful women
men pay up to £ 100,000 for full membership
women are rated 1 - 100 based entirely on their physical appearance
the higher a girl 's rating , the less she pays for membership
founder says @entity14 men ca n't find dates because women here are ' ugly '
