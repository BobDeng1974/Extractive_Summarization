series two of ' @entity1 ' , which begins next month , will have a far lighter tone and scenes of cocktail parties			1
pictured is @entity6 , played by @entity7 it was so bleak it turned viewers off and was even dubbed a ‘ rural eastenders ’			1
but those who tune in for the second series of @entity1 will be met with a far lighter tone and scenes of cocktail parties , outdoor sports and weddings			1
series two , which begins next month , leaves the grim reality of @entity21 and moves into the roaring twenties where jazz and motor cars are making an appearance			1
there ’s @entity6 , played by @entity7 , behind the wheel in her leathers – a certain sign of changing times , for cars were a rarity back then and a female driver was almost unheard of			0
she is among the new characters for the second series , so too is a boxer named @entity37 – the first black character to appear			2
then there ’s @entity39 played by @entity40 , whose family is at the centre of the period drama , laughing as his friends hoist him on their shoulders			2
and even stoic old @entity46 , the abusive drunk played by @entity48 who beat his wife and sons , demonstrates a softer side as he gives a new - born calf mouth - to - mouth and tells @entity56 , played by @entity57 , ‘ i love you ’			0
mr @entity39 is now a dairy farmer , helped by his youngest – and only surviving – son , @entity59 , and while life remains hard it seems smiles are the order of the day			0
the bleak atmosphere of the first series was blamed in part on a particularly harsh winter experienced in the @entity67 where the drama is filmed			1
but the second series saw much calmer weather as it was shot in the spring and summer			2
and it certainly makes for lighter viewing than series one , which was criticised for being too miserable and mocking ‘ the @entity73 ’			1
last year , episode one attracted 8.17 million viewers			2
but by the sixth and final instalment interest had dwindled and just 5.48 million tuned in to watch			0
the second season leaves the grim reality of @entity79 , @entity81 soldiers firing a machine gun from behind a hedge in the snow in december 1914 scenes of grief , depression and violence and themes of alcoholism and canings in school amounted to a ‘ miseryfest ’ according to many commenting online			1
taking to social networking site @entity94 at the time one wrote : ‘ @entity1 is depressing viewing for a sunday evening			1
not sure if i ’ll tackle the next episode			0
it ’ll all end in tears			0
’ another posted : ‘ do n’t think i can watch any more of @entity1 - want to end the week on a high not a low			1
’ and it seems the @entity102 has taken their comments on board			1
highlights from the first episode of season two will include a jovial ‘ man hunt ’ in which @entity109 , played by @entity110 , and his peers chase @entity39 over fields and through cobbled streets , offering him a prize of £ 5 if he can escape			0
and there is a boxing match in which men try to survive a round in the ring against boxer @entity37 , played by @entity120			0
meanwhile the wealthy @entity121 , whose family represent the aristocracy , have moved to a grander house and episode one sees @entity127 hosting a party for @entity109 , his political sponsor			0
later on in the series viewers can expect to see some weddings			1
and gaggles of friends sharing beers and jokes in the local pub are not an uncommon sight			0
the @entity1 is set in an unnamed @entity139 village and was filmed in locations around the @entity67			1
episodes are told through the eyes of @entity39 aged 100 , looking back on his life			0
speaking ahead of the series launch , writer @entity144 praised the rural landscape			2
he said : ‘ the heartbreakingly beautiful countryside is the twenty ninth character in @entity1 and arguably it ’s the biggest role			2
‘ the more time i spend up in @entity150 and around @entity151 and @entity152 the more i love this rugged , beautiful , honest part of @entity154 and the more i understand how passionately people felt about it then and how much they care about it now			0
’ @entity1 is expected to be scheduled in a prime time sunday night slot on @entity160			2
it will for six episodes , starting in august .			0

@entity102 drama ' @entity1 ' was blasted for grim story lines by viewers
viewers were turned off by show *'s* alcoholism , violence and depression
but this series will be much lighter , with parties and weddings
