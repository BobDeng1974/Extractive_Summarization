a health and safety expert was too ill too drive when he blacked out at the wheel and smashed into a bright @entity6 student 's car , a high court judge has ruled			1
@entity7 will have to pay substantial damages to 19 - year - old @entity9 , who was left with a permanent brain injury after the horror crash on the @entity12 in @entity13			1
mr @entity7 , 56 , told @entity15 's @entity14 he was not to blame because he was in a state of ' automatism ' , similar to sleepwalking , after abdominal pain caused him to pass out			1
horror crash : health and safety consultant @entity7 ( left ) will have to pay substantial damages to @entity9 ( right ) , who was left with life - changing brain damage after mr @entity7 passed out at the wheel on the @entity12 but today mr @entity24 ruled mr @entity7 was liable for the crash , because he should not have driven once he realised he was ill. the businessman , of @entity26 , @entity27 , was on his way home from a conference in @entity31 in march 2012 when he passed out on a slip road to the dual carriageway near the village of @entity35			1
the self - employed health and safety consultant 's @entity36 hit the rear of student mr @entity9 's @entity39 , shunting it under the @entity40 in front			1
mr @entity9 , a high - achieving @entity6 student , suffered life - changing brain damage in the crash and it was ' remarkable ' that he survived at all , the case heard			1
he launched a civil case to reclaim damages from the health and safety expert , insisting he was responsible for causing the pile - up			1
mr @entity9 sued mr @entity7 at the @entity14 ( pictured ) , where he relied on the rare defence of automatism people claiming ' automatism ' - where they had no control over their actions through no fault of their own - has made headlines after defendants accused of sex offences claimed they acted in their sleep			1
it has its origins in @entity62 definitions of ' insanity ' but now stands as a separate defence for people with no mental health issues			0
the defence is wide - ranging and open - ended - it can include sleep disorders or medical conditions such as an epileptic fit or a hypoglycaemic attack			2
in one criminal case in august , a driver was acquitted after a jury heard he caused a crash which killed a married couple because he was choking on a sweet			0
other examples could include a swarm of bees flying into a car			0
the defence is almost completely unheard of in civil cases , however			0
one person involved in mr @entity7 ' case said it the first example he had seen in more than 20 years			2
there are no statistics on how often the defence is pleaded or succeeds , and last year @entity91 's @entity90 said it should be scrapped in criminal cases altogether			0
the five - strong panel led by lord justice @entity94 said the wording should be changed to ' not criminally responsible by reason of recognised medical condition ' , making the law less open to interpretation			0
in his defence , mr @entity7 said the crash occurred after he had a blackout triggered by abdominal pain and he was in a state of ' automatism ' , meaning he was carrying out actions over which he had no control			2
lawyers for mr @entity9 accepted that mr @entity7 passed out seconds before the collision - but said he was negligent in choosing to drive when he did , and and in the manner of his driving			1
the judge said mr @entity7 had felt very unwell with an upset stomach when he was still at the conference and rang his wife , asking her to make him a doctor 's appointment			2
but he still decided to drive home , and ' in all likelihood ' drove close to 70mph in the outside lane which would have made it more difficult to pull over			0
had he been driving slowly and in the inside lane , ready to pull over , the accident would have been avoided			0
the judge said : ' in my judgment , having regard to the true state of the defendant 's health when he left the conference centre , he should have appreciated the risk of his condition getting worse and that , if it did , his judgment and ability to drive was likely to be impaired			0
' on a balance of probabilities , i find that the defendant should not have driven on leaving the conference centre after he felt so unwell , and that he was in breach of his duty to other road users in so doing			0
' the amount of damages to be awarded to mr @entity9 , now 22 , of @entity145 , @entity13 , will be assessed at a later date			1
there was no mention in court of whether mr @entity7 ever faced a criminal investigation .			2

@entity7 blacked out in his @entity36 on @entity12 in @entity13
he hit 19 - year - old @entity9 's car , shunting it under a @entity40
brain - damaged mr @entity9 sued for damages in civil case at @entity14
mr @entity7 said he was *n't* responsible because he was ' sleep - driving '
but he will have to pay out after judge ruled he was too ill to get on road
