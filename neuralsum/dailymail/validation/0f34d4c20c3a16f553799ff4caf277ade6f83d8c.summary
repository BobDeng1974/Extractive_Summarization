a former bodybuilder given just weeks to live after being diagnosed with cancer today blamed his 10,000 - calorie a day diet and energy drink addiction for triggering the disease			1
@entity5 was told he had just weeks to live in november after a large tumour was found on his liver			1
but he is still battling the disease five - and - a - half months later , thanks , he believes , to cutting out sugar and relying on natural remedies			1
it is a huge turn - around for the 39 - year - old , who told @entity14 he turned to a diet of burgers , pizzas and bacon sandwiches - washed down with seven to eight cans of energy drink - to create the ' perfect ' bodybuilder 's physique			1
pictured : mr @entity5 before he go sick ( left ) , and afterwards ( right ) mr @entity5 was given three weeks to live by doctors in november but - after committing to a healthy diet , which completely cuts out sugar - he has lived for a further five - and - a - half months but he now believes the high - protein , fatty diet he lived on for four to five years may have led to his illness , first diagnosed in 2010			1
' it was because i was trying to be as big as possible , ' mr @entity5 told @entity14			1
' i ca n't say it was the diet for sure , but things like the energy drinks could be contributing factors			1
red meats - all things we have found out have so many impurities in them now			2
' i think it was a combination of it all			0
' mr @entity5 had been a bodybuilder for 20 years before he became ill. in the beginning , he admits to taking steroids for about a year to create his physique because ' everybody did it '			1
but he soon turned his back on them , as he began to build his personal training business			0
it was then his diet took a turn for the worse			2
' i could train seven clients in a day , back - to - back , ' he said			2
' then i would have to have the energy to train myself			2
' he added : ' i was constantly on the go			0
' @entity5 was on a high - calorie diet for four to five years , as he tried to get make his body as big as possible			1
here , he reveals what he ate during an average day			2
breakfast : an entire pack of bacon , made into eight sandwiches and a protein shake 2,500 calories snack : a steak muffin ( sandwich ) 225 calories snack : two sweet potatoes and a full chicken 1,190 calories snack : a protein shake 262 calories snack : two protein bars 580 calories snack : large @entity85 meal with a diet @entity87 calories snack : supermarket bought pizza - normally pepperoni 888 calories dinner : chips or rice with three chicken breasts or a steak 783 calories snack : 400g of beef on its own 1,000 calories supper : 15 boiled eggs 1,170 calories snack : protein shake 262 calories total : 9,715 calories a day but that is not all : overnight , @entity5 used to wake up every two hours to eat either a full pack of @entity110 , a jar of peanut butter , or more protein bars - pushing him over the 10,000 calorie - a - day mark mr @entity5 said his hectic lifestyle meant he turned to fast food to get the calories he needed some days , he would see seven clients back - to - back - and would fit eating every two hours around them mr @entity5 found the energy from seven to eight cans of energy drink while eating every two hours			1
and while some of it was typical bodybuilder fare - protein shakes , eggs and chicken - other bits were less conventional			0
mr @entity5 would grab a @entity85 for a snack , and a pizza on the way home - which he would eat while his girlfriend of five years cooked dinner			1
at his biggest , he was 20 stone			0
but then the personal trainer from @entity25 , @entity26 , became unwell five - and - a - half years ago , and doctors discovered a growth			0
mr @entity5 and partner @entity139 ( pictured ) started to research natural medicine after his diagnosis he was offered chemotherapy and a liver transplant , but he decided to turn both down in favour of natural remedies			1
' i refused it from day one , ' he said			2
' the main reason why i chose to do natural instead of artificial was because i wanted to live			1
i did n't want to die			0
' but that meant he needed to completely rethink his diet , which was full of things like acids - which he believes help cancers thrive			2
and for a year , it was successful : mr @entity5 's tumour disappeared			1
' but i got complacent , ' he admitted			0
' the old lifestyle crept in again			0
' in 2013 , he collapsed outside the gym where he was working as a trainer , and rushed to hospital			0
for the majority of the next year , he returned to his healthy regime			0
but then things started to go wrong : he broke up with his girlfriend briefly , and found himself homeless - making it hard to concentrate on getting better			2
by november , he was in hospital ' hooked up to every machine you could think of '			0
doctors said he had just three weeks to live			1
the tumour had got too big to operate , and there was little the doctors felt they could do			1
' i was offered chemotherapy , but doctors basically said there was no point , ' mr @entity5 said			1
mr @entity5 , at his heaviest , weighed 20 stone - something he admits was also not good for his body mr @entity5 and @entity184 , who have been together for five years , hope to inspire others with his new diet it is not known exactly what causes liver cancer , but research has suggested diet could be a factor			1
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes - has been linked to cases of liver cancer			0
the disease occurs when small deposits of fat build up in the tissue			0
but while it is a common condition , in some cases , with people who have high levels of fat the liver can become inflamed			0
this can scar the liver over time - causing cirrhosis , which is linked to many cases of liver cancer			0
energy drinks , meanwhile , have been linked to cases of bowel cancer by scientists in @entity216 , according to @entity217			0
it was also reported earlier this year that some energy drinks have as many as 20 teaspoons of sugar in them			0
sources : @entity222 so he and girlfriend @entity139 - his ' rock ' - began his healthy regime once more			0
they also began fundraising to help pay for the treatment costs and have attracted more than 2,000 likes on @entity230 by regularly posting videos of his progress			0
he has also visited a doctor in @entity235 - and is hoping to shrink his tumour by using natural medicine			1
mr @entity5 is also hoping to inspire others through social media to live more healthily			1
ms @entity139 , 27 , said : ' there are lots of examples out there of people beating cancer naturally , even when they 've been told there 's nothing conventional medicine can do for them			1
' the support @entity5 has received has really lifted him			2
people have been so positive and it has really made a difference to his attitude			0
' now he 's determined to inspire others to live more healthily			2
' mr @entity5 added : ' it has been very difficult but i 'm 100 per cent determined to beat this			2
' and five - and - a - half months later , i 'm doing something right			0
' to follow mr @entity5 's progress , visit @entity230 .			1
