travelling with toddlers can be hellish			2
especially if you leave before dawn and realise en route to the airport that you 've forgotten to bring your pram			2
it was too late for us to turn back and , no , you ca n't buy a buggy at @entity9 because nobody is stupid enough to leave theirs at home			2
happily , @entity13 , a @entity15 family hotel in @entity17 - west @entity16 , is acutely geared up for children			1
a fine spot on the shoreline : @entity13 occupies a pristine position on the north - west coast of @entity16 friends had told us it was the best hotel for children that they had ever stayed in , so our expectations were high			1
after a four - and - a - half - hour flight , and a 45 - minute drive from @entity36 airport , my wife and i and our two children ( aged three and one ) were greeted with cold flannels and glasses of cool bitter lemon			1
a buggy materialised on request and our anxieties melted away with our ice cubes			2
@entity13 , meaning ' queen ' in ancient @entity45 , lives up to its regal name			1
it 's all marble floors , water features and amphora pots			2
the service is miraculous and there is even a 24 - hour ( complimentary ) infant menu			1
perched on a hilltop overlooking a @entity59 bay , the hotel is within walking distance of its own sheltered beach , a boat ride away from ravishingly beautiful blue sea lagoons and a five - minute drive from @entity65 's bathplace , where the goddess disported herself			1
( legend has it your beauty can be restored with a drop of its spring water , but annoyingly , it has yet to work for me			2
) there is no denying it is an expensive destination			2
if you need to ask how much the villas with infinity pools cost , you wo n't be able to afford them			0
@entity13 has all the creature comforts - two spectacular outdoor swimming pools , an indoor pool , spa , four restaurants - but its @entity85 is its design : it resembles a traditional @entity16 village			1
the gardens and white - washed villas are arranged around a square with its own @entity93 chapel			1
yes , it 's a little disneyfied , but it works			0
the hotel is cleverly laid out on different levels so it never feels full			0
directly above the spa is the chapel , so you can worship your body and soul in quick succession			0
the clientele is intriguingly euroeclectic			0
there was a handsome , septuagenarian , @entity107 gentleman with a beautiful young wife and three daughters dressed in identical couture ; @entity114 's @entity113 contemporary @entity111 and his @entity116 wife @entity115 ; and the odd tattooed @entity117 with a body - builder 's physique , gold chains around his neck and a golden woman on his arm			1
we knew @entity16 from previous trips and its extraordinary range of @entity128 amphitheatres and mythological sites			1
but you can be forgiven for not wanting to leave the hotel grounds			0
we made a point every day of walking through its fragrant gardens lined with jasmine and bougainvillea			0
when we found we did n't have appropriate footwear for our one - year - old son , the staff offered to fetch us @entity140 from the capital 80 miles away			1
we bravely walked out to buy a € 3 pair from the local market ; a transaction felt positively subversive			0
there is no better way to stress - test a hotel than with toddlers			1
every request was met instantly			0
please can you erect netting on our terrace to prevent our tearaways from escaping into the garden ? done , sir			0
please can you put a latch on the front door to prevent them letting themselves out ? no problem			0
making a splash : @entity13 is ideal for family holidays ( even if you 've gone and forgotten the pram ) in the afternoon , we tended to drop the children off at the kids ' club , which they loved			1
it was air - conditioned and manned by calm and kind polyglot staff			1
almost all of the 166 rooms have sea views			0
we had two interconnecting rooms with terraces			0
the decor was bland , but quality bland			0
breakfast was served on an outside terrace under almond trees			0
there were fresh bowls of fruit salad , date truffles and raw honey served on the comb			0
in the evenings , we dined with the children @entity189 in the square , serenaded by local musicians			0
on offer was a traditional @entity16 buffet , a smorgasbord of @entity45 salads and roast suckling pig on a spit			1
@entity13 is a second generation family - run hotel , and it prides itself on repeat visitors			1
we left with indelible memories of swimming in the pellucid waters of the blue lagoon , dancing with our children under the moonlight to violinists and passing a school of dolphins in our motorboat			0
it was like going on honeymoon - but with your children in tow			2
@entity217 ( 0800 294 9318 , www.classic-collection.co.uk ) offers seven nights at @entity13 from £ 8,799 for a family of four during may half - term			1
price based on two adults and two children sharing a family studio , full - board , and includes return flights to @entity36 and private transfers .			2

the five - star @entity13 resort sits on the north - west coast of @entity16
this *luxury* hideaway *caters* to families and young couples alike
