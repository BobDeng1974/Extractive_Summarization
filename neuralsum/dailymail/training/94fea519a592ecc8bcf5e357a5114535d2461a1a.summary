@entity0 is dimming at the show that @entity2 built			0
network insiders tell @entity4 that the long - running talk show could end after this season , amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts			1
currently in its eighteenth season , the show created by retired tv journalist @entity2 is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
now under the umbrella of @entity20 , the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of ' @entity24			1
' ' the brass at @entity20 feels like they 've tried to do everything possible to breathe new life into this show , ' said the insider			2
they moved it from @entity33 to the @entity20 division , that was having so much success with @entity24			2
' they 're ready to abandon ship at this point , ' the source told @entity4			0
when contacted by @entity4 , a show spokesperson denied any plan by @entity20 to end the show			2
@entity20 is winning in the morning show wars with @entity24 and the network hoped that the magic of that team could rub off on @entity0			1
despite multiple changes to the set , a new show introduction , a shift to softer topics and adding guest co-hosts to the show , ratings still have still declined			0
' @entity20 feels it 's exhausted their options with @entity0 and now it 's time to expand the existing franchise , @entity24			2
they feel that since @entity24 is already beating @entity77 's today during the first two hours of the broadcast , why not extend the morning broadcast , ' the insider revealed			2
in 2012 , following the cancellation of talk show @entity80 , @entity20 launched a test show called @entity83 , the network 's first extension of @entity24			1
the temporary summer series hosted by @entity87 and former @entity24 anchor @entity88 performed well in the ratings for @entity20 and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back			1
' the idea to bring back @entity83 is something that 's strongly being considered			2
they believe the success of @entity24 could carry over right into that 11am slot that @entity0 currently holds , ' another insider said			0
@entity24 squared : @entity87 and former @entity24 anchor @entity88 performed strong in the ratings for @entity20 when they tested @entity83 and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back			1
there 's internal talk that @entity20 would use one of the newer @entity24 contributors @entity105 ( left ) or @entity106 as her co-anchor on the re-launched show			1
@entity109 , who previously hosted the news magazine series @entity111 , has been itching to do that show again because she likes the pop culture - oriented format			0
there 's internal talk that @entity20 would use one of the newer @entity24 contributors @entity105 or @entity106 as her co-anchor on the re-launched show			1
' they plan on shooting some test shows in the coming weeks to freshen up the @entity83 concept			0
they plan to shoot a few pilot episodes following @entity24 going off air and retooling the show just in case they need to have it ready for a late summer launch , ' the source revealed			0
canceling @entity0 would be costly for @entity20 , as @entity14 has one more year remaining on her contract and her pay - or - play agreement would require she be compensated her $ 5 million a year salary whether the show aired or not			1
good old days : @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity2 from @entity0 @entity15 only signed a one - year deal to return for $ 4 million			1
@entity137 and @entity138 have three - year contracts for $ 400,000 ; however they would n't have to be compensated if the show ended			1
' @entity14 is the winner either way			0
she 's wanted out of this contract for years and begged to be let go during the show overhaul last summer			0
to get paid to just go home would make her very happy , ' the source offered			0
@entity0 launched in 1997 and became successful in the 11am time slot on @entity20 , a time period that no other morning show had been able to perform well in			0
the show originated with @entity2 , @entity135 , @entity134 , @entity133 and @entity151			0
it went on to have @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 join the panel series			0
@entity15 signed on to moderate the show in 2006 , but departed the show after a heated on - air altercation with @entity154 in 2007 .			2

the long - running talk show could end after this season
behind - the - scenes *clashes* between @entity15 and @entity14 and even @entity17 have created a *bad* vibe on the set
@entity20 may extend @entity24 and bring back @entity168
@entity17 has a one year - contract that ends this season
@entity14 is the winner no matter what - she has one more year remaining on her ' pay or play ' contract even if the show ends
