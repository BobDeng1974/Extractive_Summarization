by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 12:25 est , 29 may 2013 a grieving mother is taking legal action after hospital staff branded her unborn son ‘ lazy ’ - when he actually suffering from a rare genetic condition that had paralysed his limbs			1
@entity7 , 27 , was told by a sonographer that her baby did not move during scans simply because he was ' lazy '			1
but the distraught mother - of - three refused to accept that theory and demanded further tests - which finally revealed her unborn son had a rare muscular and skeletal disorder that meant he could not move his arms or legs			1
he died just hours after birth several weeks later			1
@entity7 , 27 , was concerned when her son was not kicking or moving during pregnancy			1
she repeatedly raised her concerns but was reassured by a sonographer that the baby was ' just a lazy boy '			1
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ it ’s disgusting			2
they kept saying my baby was just a " lazy boy " , when in fact he was seriously ill. the poor little mite was n’t lazy			1
he could n’t move because his limbs were fused solid			2
‘ i kept telling them something was wrong because i had n’t felt any kicks at all , but they would n’t listen			0
as far as they were concerned he was just lazy and i was made to feel like a paranoid mum			2
‘ when we finally found out what was wrong with @entity38 i felt devastated and let down that nobody had listened to me earlier			2
‘ i want justice for @entity38			2
no mother should go through that			0
’ @entity7 was scanned 17 weeks into her pregnancy when she first raised concerns at @entity45 last year			1
she explained : ‘ i ’d suffered a previous loss at 17 weeks so the scan was to offer assurance			1
' they said i had a perfect little baby boy but i noticed he did n’t move at all during the scan and i thought it was odd			1
’ @entity7 could not see movement when scans of @entity38 ( such as this one taken at 22 weeks ) were carried out at hospital			1
it was n't until 26 weeks in that doctors spotted a serious congenital disorder at her 20 - week scan became distressed again when she noticed the baby was n't moving			1
‘ i kept asking why he was n’t moving , ' she recalled			0
' he was like a statue on the screen			0
alarm bells were ringing and i started crying because i knew it was n’t right			0
‘ that ’s when the sonographer turned around and told me not to worry because he was just a ‘ lazy boy			1
i knew that was n’t right			0
’ mrs @entity7 , from @entity71 in @entity72 , returned two weeks later for another scan where she again raised concerns that her baby was n't moving			1
she was once again assured he was just ' lazy ' and told to relax			2
‘ i could n’t relax			0
i knew from my other pregnancies it was n’t normal for him not to move at all and i begged someone to listen			2
' @entity7 knew from previous pregnancies ( from left to right her children @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 ) that it was n't normal for babies not to move or kick			1
she said doctors dismissed her concerns and made her feel ' paranoid ' but mrs @entity7 said she was denied more scans			1
over the following three weeks and five days she called the maternity unit 22 times , expressing concern that her baby still had not moved			1
‘ i felt like i was going mad			0
i knew something was wrong with my baby			2
it is not normal to get to 24 weeks pregnant and not feel your baby move , ' said ms @entity7 , who has three other children - @entity83 , 4 , @entity84 , 8 , and @entity85 , 6			1
‘ i was an emotional wreck and kept begging for another scan to look for movement , but i was told it would be of no benefit			0
‘ i even started to think perhaps i was paranoid			0
' finally she was called in for another scan at 26 weeks and an emergency referral was made when medics agreed it was unusual that the tot still was n’t moving			0
she was sent to experts at @entity111 the following day and it was quickly confirmed her son was suffering with severe birth abnormalities			0
@entity38 was eventually diagnosed with fetal akinesia deformation sequence			1
he was delivered via c - section and died just hours later and before @entity7 had regained consciousness			1
her husband @entity118 ( pictured ) was forced to break the heartbreaking news to her mrs @entity7 said : ‘ i ’d been assured all along he was perfect whenever i had raised concerns , but in fact he was so poorly every joint in his body was fused			1
' that is why he had been so still			0
that is why i had not felt a movement or kick			0
he had never been lazy at all			0
@entity38 died just five hours after birth ‘ i was utterly distraught and angry at the way i had been treated but my priority was my baby			1
’ she was advised to terminate the pregnancy when it was confirmed her son had the genetic condition fetal akinesia deformation sequence			1
the condition causes the bones to fuse together and reduces lung function amongst other serious abnormalities			2
‘ it all happened so fast			0
if you ’re told there is nothing wrong for that long and then suddenly advised to abort your baby your world collapses			2
‘ i refused because if there was a chance he could survive , no matter how disabled , then he deserved that			0
’ but tragically , just two weeks later , mrs @entity7 s water ’s went at 28 weeks and she was rushed into theatre for an emergency caesarian section on november 14th last year			1
@entity38 lived for five hours but passed away before his mother woke from the operation			1
her husband @entity118 , 27 , cradled the newborn as he died and later had to break the heartbreaking news to his wife that he had died			2
she said : ‘ i broke down when they brought him to me			0
i tried to dress him and his limbs were so rigid - it was no wonder he had never moved or i had never felt a kick			0
i wanted to know how they could have missed it for so long			0
‘ i had repeatedly told them something was wrong with my baby			0
‘ her son was buried next to the baby @entity7 had lost at 17 weeks			1
she then set about seeking answers from the hospital			0
@entity45 's general manager apologised for the blunder , saying that any comments made during @entity7 's scan were intended to reassure her but that it was inappropriate that the sonographer suggested her baby was ' lazy ' ‘ i wanted to express what they had put me and my family through by ignoring my fears for so long			1
’ in a letter to the family , the general manager of the hospital explained the baby ’s condition might have been missed because it only became noticeable in the later stages of pregnancy			2
@entity7 is now looking for answers to the questions surrounding her pregnancy with @entity38 but @entity7 disputes this : ‘ i begged them to listen to me from 20 weeks but it was easier to dismiss me as paranoid			1
’ the letter from the general manager also apologised for this and said : ‘ i apologise that you were made to feel that you were paranoid ; this is unacceptable and the members of staff that you refer to in your letter have been seen … and their attitude and behaviour addressed			0
’ the letter went on : ‘ any comments made during the scan would have had the intention of reassurance			0
it was inappropriate that the sonographer suggested your baby was " lazy "			2
this has been addressed with her			0
’ the hospital has also issued the following statement			0
@entity220 , director of care quality and chief nurse at @entity223 , said : ' firstly , the @entity224 would like to offer our most sincere condolences to the @entity227 at this sad time			0
' it is not appropriate to comment specifically about @entity7 ’s experience , however the concerns of mrs @entity7 were raised through the @entity224 ’s formal complaints system			2
' we have completed a full investigation followed by a meeting with the family to present our findings			0
' @entity237 will continue to offer its guidance to the family should they need any further advice			0

@entity7 , 27 , from @entity72 , was worried when she noticed her baby did n't move during scans carried out at 17 - weeks and after
but sonographer dismissed her fears saying the baby was just a ' lazy boy '
over the next six weeks she asked 22 times for further scans and tests
doctors eventually discovered the baby suffered with foetal akinesia deformation sequence , a condition *characterised* by fused bones
she was advised to terminate the pregnancy but refused and baby @entity38 died just five hours after birth
