it 's something we all do on a near daily basis , but could the reason behind those all - too - frequent ' bad hair days ' be because you 're washing your hair wrong ? the reason your hair feels silky soft after a visit to the salon is n't pure coincidence ; it 's because hairdressers are carefully trained to wash and condition hair using a tried - and - tested regime			1

by working your shampoo into the top section of your hair and then rinsing it out , it automatically cleanses the ends and stops damage occurring in the lengths did you know that you only need to use product on your scalp and no necessarily the ends ? by working your shampoo into the top section of your hair and then rinsing it out , it automatically cleanses the ends and stops damage occurring in the lengths			1
extreme care should be taken when washing your hair and while you may think scrubbing hard will thoroughly cleanse it , that could n't be further from the truth			1
putting too much pressure on your scalp can actually result in greasier hair			0

stylists also say it 's imperative to rinse your hair for twice the amount of time as lathering on product and never use hot water			1
' women often wash their hair with water which is too hot , thinking it will make hair cleaner , ' said @entity48			1
washing your hair in tepid water is better for the follicles with the added bonus of saving money on your bills			1
' the hot water activates the sebaceous gland which secretes oil and can leave hair greasy soon after washing			2
use warm , tepid water for ultra clean hair and to extend the life of your blow dry			1
' do n't rely on just one shampoo thought a standard shampoo will give you the hair of your dreams ? wrong			1
' we put our hair through a lot in the week , so as you might exfoliate your skin once a week to remove dead skin cells , washing hair with a clarifying shampoo will allow hair and scalp to breathe , ' said @entity48			2
use a clarifying shampoo , such as @entity112 , once a week to remove impurities and product build up			2
when drying , avoid rubbing with towels , this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless , blot dry instead to prevent damage @entity48 also believes it 's essential to work scalp care treatments into your regime			2

scalp care products such as @entity129 and @entity131 range can help leave hair feeling thicker , shinier and more resistant			0
industry experts also recommend getting a hacial - or hair facial - a few times a year			2
@entity135 have launched dermabrasion services for the scalp , which promise to remove build - up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation			0
@entity142 , meanwhile , have a @entity143 whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp 's oil levels			2
they then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair , which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip. @entity157 , @entity159 ’ @entity158 , also believes in the power of double shampooing and exfoliating			0
she explained : ' investing in professional shampoo and conditioner such as a duo from the @entity166 or @entity168 range means washing your hair daily can be beneficial to a healthy scalp , aiding in hair growth			0
' to achieve the best results from your shampoo , make sure hair is well saturated with water this will help in achieving the best lather , allowing the hair and scalp to be cleansed thoroughly			1
' two shampoos is advisable to make sure hair and scalp is thoroughly cleansed and always finish with a conditioner appropriate for your hair type and avoid conditioner on the scalp to prevent oily roots			0
do n't @entity188 you may be in a rush but all hairdressers emphasise the importance of avoiding towel drying			1
' when drying , avoid rubbing with towels , this creates friction and can damage the cuticle leaving hair dull and lifeless , blot dry instead to prevent damage , ' said @entity157			0
dabbing your hair with the towel , followed by a quick squeeze to get rid of excess water is the way forward			0
it 's also important to avoid combing your hair after you 've showered and instead take a wide - toothed comb through locks whilst your in the shower waiting for your conditioner to work its magic			1
never comb your hair straight after washing it , instead comb through it whilst the conditioner is setting in			0
