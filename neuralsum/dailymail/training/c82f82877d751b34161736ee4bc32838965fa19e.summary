by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 07:45 est , 20 february 2013 a huge rise in employment means that there are more people in work than every before , with almost 30million @entity7 holding jobs , it was revealed today			1
and the number of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two years			0
but wages continue to fall in real terms , with pay rises lagging far behind the rate of inflation			1
climbing : the number of people in work is at a record high as the economic recovery continues positive : the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2012 figures from the @entity27 showed that unemployment fell by 14,000 in the final quarter of last year to a total of 2.5million , or 7.8 per cent			1
in addition , 12,500 fewer people claimed jobseeker 's allowance , with the total of 1.54million being the lowest since june 2011			0
overall , 29.73million held some sort of job , the largest number ever recorded - 71.5 per cent of the @entity7 population			1
that is a rise of 154,000 between september and december			2
there was a shift in employment from part - time jobs to full - time , reversing one of the recession 's most worrying trends			0
the number of people in full - time work increased by almost 200,000 , while there were 43,000 fewer part - timers			2
boom : employment is up and joblessness continues to fall despite the poor state of the economy sluggish : wages are growing more slowly than inflation , leading to a real - terms pay cut for most @entity62 , the @entity63 , pointed to @entity27 statistics showing that the number of people out of work for more than a year had fallen by 15,000 , to 879,000			1
' the fall in long - term unemployment is particularly welcome and shows that the training and support we are offering is helping people move off benefits and into work , ' he said			1
' these figures show another big increase in full - time jobs , half a million more @entity7 people in work over the past year and more women in employment than ever before			1
' the @entity7 is now ahead of many of its international rivals when it comes to cutting unemployment and creating jobs which is so important as we compete in a global race			1
' clash : @entity62 , left , claimed today 's figures show the jobs market is healthy , but his @entity94 opposite number @entity95 , right , called for stronger measures to boost economic growth however , there was less good news in the youth unemployment figures , as it emerged that 11,000 more young people were out of a job			1
in total 974,000 16 - to 24 - year - olds are currently looking for work - a youth unemployment rate of 20.8 per cent			2
the governor of the @entity108 believes that more extraordinary measures are needed to boost the economy , it emerged today			0
sir @entity111 and two other senior bank figures voted for further quantitative easing at this month 's meeting of the @entity115			0
however , their proposal to inject another £ 25billion in an attempt to re-start economic growth was voted down after the other six members of the committee opposed it			0
the @entity115 decided instead to use more targeted measures to return the @entity7 to growth , after the national economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2012			2
@entity126 - which essentially amounts to printing money - has been controversial because of its potential to cause or worsen inflation			0
and average wages also continue to flag , rising just 1.4 per cent over the past year to reach £ 472 per week , roughly £ 24,600 per year			1
since inflation is standing at 2.7 per cent by the @entity135 measure , that means the average worker has less spending power now than a year ago			2
wage growth has been lower than inflation since mid- 2008 , which marked the start of the recession which has devastated the @entity7 economy			1
the average employee works 31.9 hours per week , up slightly from the year before			0
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity95 said : ' today 's fall in the headline rate of unemployment is welcome but it is now clearer than ever that @entity7 workers are paying the price to get a job or keep a job			1
' people have now taken an average £ 1,200 pay cut since the election because jobs are so hard to come by and today we see there 's still more than five people chasing every vacancy			0
' youth unemployment has risen yet again , back towards the million mark , the number of women out of work has gone up and long - term unemployment is still far too high			2
' what @entity7 now needs from next month 's budget is an industrial - strength back - to - work programme to match the crisis we face			1
' lagging : wage growth has been lower than inflation since the start of the recession in 2008 good news : the number of unemployed people has fallen but wages continue to rise slowly @entity181 , general secretary of the @entity183 union , said : ' that we have mass unemployment of two and a half million five years into this recession is waste on a grand scale			1
' to this must be added the millions in enforced temporary and part time jobs and those massively underemployed			0
' what is tragic is that there is no light at the end of the tunnel as we are in the middle of a triple dip recession			0
' the @entity199 welcomed the figures , but expressed worries that lagging wages ' show we are not out of the woods yet '			0
@entity206 , director for employment and skills , said : ' it is particularly good that so much of this month 's jobs growth is driven by full timers , given worries about under - employment			0
' dr @entity214 , director of @entity215 , said : ' the @entity7 jobs market continues to astound			2
we are in the middle of both a jobs boom and a pay slump as jobseekers struggle to gain or retain employment in a stagnant economy by pricing themselves into work			0
' this is unlike anything seen in this country since the @entity228 , with the economy using more and more people at falling real rates of pay to produce a static level of output			0

more @entity7 are in work than ever before as unemployment falls to 7.8 ***%***
but wages rise by just 1.4 ***%*** to £ 472 per week , with inflation at 2.7 ***%***
