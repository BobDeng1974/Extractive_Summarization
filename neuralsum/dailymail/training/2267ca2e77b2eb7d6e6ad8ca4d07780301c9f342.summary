pizza is the second - highest source of calories for kids ages 2 to 18 , researchers have found			1
they say @entity6 's love of pizza has meant about 20 percent of youths eat pizza on any given day			1
they say the food must be curbed , and made healthier			0
because it is eaten so frequently - its nutrient content should be improved , say the researchers on days when children ate pizza , they took in an additional 84 calories , 3 grams of saturated fat , and 134 milligrams of sodium than they did on no - pizza days			2
adolescents took in an extra 230 calories , 5 grams of saturated fat and 484 milligrams of sodium			0
in 2009 - 2010 , on days pizza was eaten , it made up 22 percent of total caloric intake among children and 26 percent of total caloric intake in adolescents			1
on days they eat pizza , children and adolescents take in significantly more calories , fat and sodium than on days they do n't , the new study has shown			1
because it is eaten so frequently - its nutrient content should be improved , say the researchers , whose report is published in the journal @entity39			0
' curbing pizza consumption alone is n't enough to significantly reduce the adverse dietary effects of pizza , ' says lead author @entity43 , associate director of the @entity44 at the @entity45 at the @entity46			0
' it 's a very common and convenient food , so improving the nutritional content of pizza , in addition to reducing the amount of pizza eaten , could help lessen its negative nutritional impact			1
' kids should not eat more than one or two slices of pizza for a meal , and should pair that with salad , rather than with another high - calorie food , the researchers concluded the researchers examined dietary recall data from youths ages 2 - 19 who were participating in the @entity67 between 2003 and 2010			1
they found that caloric intake from pizza among children ages 2 - 11 dropped 25 percent between 2003 and 2010			2
among adolescents who ate pizza , calories from pizza fell , although the prevalence of pizza consumption increased slightly for this age group			0
' children and adolescents do not adequately compensate by eating less of other foods on days when they eat pizza , ' said @entity80 , who is professor of health policy and administration in the @entity83			1
for adolescents , the additional fat and sodium intake on days that pizza is eaten represents 24 percent and 21 percent , respectively , of the recommended daily values for those nutrients , she said			2
pizza had the largest impact on diet when eaten as a snack between meals			1
children took in an additional 202 calories , and adolescents an extra 365 calories , on days they ate pizza as a snack compared to days they did not			0
for adolescents , the additional fat and sodium intake on days that pizza is eaten represents 24 percent and 21 percent , respectively , of the recommended daily values for those nutrients the researchers also looked at where and when pizza was eaten			2
they found that from 2003 to 2010 , calories from pizza at dinner fell , but pizza consumption at lunch and from school cafeterias did not change			0
however , overall caloric intake was similar on days when pizza from school cafeterias was and was n't eaten , possibly because non-pizza lunch offerings were similarly high in calories , @entity80 said			0
pizza 's contribution to excess calories was generally consistent across race , gender and income , except it was significantly higher among @entity125 children as compared to @entity127 children			0
' because when pizza is consumed , it increases the total daily calories that children and adolescents take in , it could be an important contributor to the obesity epidemic , ' says study co-author dr. @entity133 , director of the @entity134 at the @entity135 at the @entity136			0
' moderating pizza consumption should become another goal in our efforts to reduce obesity in @entity6 youth			1
' the authors also suggest that because of its prevalence and impact on diet , pizza should be addressed specifically in nutritional counseling .			2

20 percent of youths in the @entity6 eat pizza on any given day
team call for curbs on pizza eating among youth
kids should not eat more than one or two slices of pizza for a meal
say healthier *alternatives* should also be *developed* to stop obesity *crisis*
pizza had the largest impact on diet when eaten as a snack between meals
