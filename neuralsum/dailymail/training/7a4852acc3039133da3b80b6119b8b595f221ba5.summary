’ @entity171 is the most common form of blood cancer in children			0
the condition affects the body 's white blood cells , which help fight infection			0
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( @entity180 ) and acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity74 ) are forms of cancer which affect blood - producing cells in the bone marrow			1
when a child has leukaemia , control of blood cell production breaks down			0
the bone marrow - the soft tissue in the middle of our bones where all our blood cells are made - makes lots of abnormal white blood , or leukaemia cells			1
these never mature into proper white blood cells , vital to a healthy immune system , and so children with leukaemia are at more risk of infection			0
the cure rate for children with acute myeloid leukaemia ( @entity74 ) is now around 65 per cent .			2

@entity4 , of @entity18 , diagnosed with @entity74 in 2009
she was treated with aggressive chemotherapy which made her lose hair
treatment led to weak bones and her leg once broke during nappy change
while battling *disease* she said : ' mummy i want to dance when i ’m better '
