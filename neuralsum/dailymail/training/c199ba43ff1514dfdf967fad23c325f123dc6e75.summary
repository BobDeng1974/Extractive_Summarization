@entity0 will not be changing the way the grass is prepared for next week ’s start , despite all the slips and falls that became such a talking point 12 months ago			1
few know the lawns of the @entity8 as well as @entity9 , who revealed yesterday that research by the club found no underlying cause for the amount of players who marked the first week by sprawling all over the courts			1
‘ it did n’t perturb myself or @entity19 ( the head groundsman ) because we collect and study so much information about the courts , ’ said @entity9			2
‘ we scientifically measure things like their hardness , the length of the grass , the moisture , the bounce			0
these were found to be identical to the year before			0
keep off the grass ! @entity9 claims there is no reason why players were losing their footing at @entity36 ‘ i was watching @entity37 ’s and seeing players sliding everywhere and nobody was commenting			1
there will always be some slips and falls on new grass courts early in a tournament and it ’s understandable that there is more focus on @entity0			2
‘ i think it was emphasised a bit more last year because some high - profile players like @entity50 and @entity51 had falls			1
one of the benefits of having a three - week gap between the @entity55 and @entity0 from next year is that players will have more time to adjust and they will be moving better from the start			1
’ @entity9 sits on the tournament ’s @entity58 that also hands out wildcards and hopes the arrival of @entity63 @entity62 as the @entity65 ’s director of player development will mean more @entity67 players put a strong case forward for receiving them			1
legs akimbo : @entity70 slips on the grass during his semi-final with @entity73 del @entity74 ‘ i think he ( @entity62 ) will ensure very high standards are set			2
there are no grey areas about trying to be as successful a player as you can , you have to be properly committed			0
@entity80 ( gb no 2 ) is an example of someone who has a lot of natural ability but has a challenge in giving that consistent commitment			0
’ @entity9 believes that , regardless of what happened in 2013 , @entity70 and @entity87 are the favourites for @entity0			1
‘ i think you have to say they are , based on what has happened so far this year , but @entity93 and @entity94 are only just behind			1
‘ @entity94 is an interesting one , it ’s getting harder for him at other slams but he should see this as a chance to add to his tally			2
i can see him being very dangerous			0
’ staying power : @entity9 would like to see @entity93 take on @entity101 as his long - term coach on the subject of @entity101 , @entity9 believes it important that her arrival in @entity93 ’s camp is seen as long - term and not as a trial			1
‘ i hope it lasts a long time because continuity is important and you do n’t want an air of something being a trial			0
‘ i think the role of @entity116 ( @entity117 , @entity93 ’s assistant coach ) is going to be very important this fortnight			0
he does n’t always gets the credit he deserves , he knows @entity93 better than anyone			0
’ @entity9 is an ambassador for @entity123			0
