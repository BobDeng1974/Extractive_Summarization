published : 09:56 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 13:13 est , 10 may 2013 @entity1 is believed to be considering a billion dollar offer for @entity3 and @entity5 's nook tablet business			1
the move would allow the giant to quickly launch a range of tablets under its surface brand to take on @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 in the tablet wars			1
shares in @entity16 soared 22 percent following the report @entity1 is considering an offer to acquire the tablet and e-book business of @entity16 's @entity22 unit			1
the nook range of tablets , which range from @entity26 hd tablets to e-book with ' paper ' e-ink screens			0
@entity1 is rumoured to be purchasing the business for a billion dollars the latest @entity30 market share data for tablets , released earlier this month , leaves @entity16 out of the industry 's top five vendors , suggesting its share of the global market is negligible			1
@entity1 's new surface tablets - the first of which hit the market last october - have only a 1.8 percent share			1
@entity16 has typically launched a new edition of the @entity22 every year			1
but this year it simply updated its high - definition tablets by adding @entity13 's app store , which a number of analysts saw as an easy way for the company to launch a ' new ' nook			0
the technology website @entity48 reported that @entity1 , which already owns a 17 percent stake in @entity22 , was proposing a $ 1 billion offer to buy all of @entity22 's digital assets			1
the report also suggested that @entity54 would stop selling @entity26 - based tablets entirely by the end of fiscal 2014 in favor of distributing content via other publishers ' platforms			0
a source familiar with the documents cited by @entity48 confirmed their authenticity			0
the source said the documents dated from march , suggesting that any deal - if one is even pending - was not imminent			0
it was not clear from the @entity48 story whether @entity1 had formally made an offer to @entity16 or whether @entity16 had replied			1
@entity16 and @entity1 declined to comment			2
@entity1 acquired its stake in the @entity22 unit a little more than a year ago in a deal that valued the entire unit at $ 1.7 billion			2
in december the @entity76 publisher @entity77 bought a stake in the unit at a $ 1.8 billion valuation			0
but @entity22 sales have disappointed since			0
revenue dropped 26 percent in the most recent holiday quarter as nook sold fewer digital readers and tablets and had to cut prices			0
just this week @entity16 slashed the price of its best tablet by one - third as a special promotion for @entity91			0
it was not immediately clear why @entity1 would want to buy @entity22 's digital assets , unless it wished to make a preemptive strike against @entity13 and shift @entity22 away from the @entity26 platform			1
there is already a @entity22 app for @entity98 devices			0
@entity1 's recent acquisitions - such as online chat service @entity100 and business networking site @entity102 - have not been content - focused			2
@entity107 analyst @entity106 , in a note to clients on thursday , said a lower valuation for the @entity22 unit was appropriate and that $ 1 billion was even higher than he had modeled			0
@entity16 shares rose 22 percent to $ 21.70 in afternoon trading			2
the move would @entity1 in a head ion battle with @entity11			1
here , @entity11 ceo @entity114 introduces the new @entity115 during an event in @entity117 the stock last traded at those levels a year ago , around the time of the @entity1 investment			1
@entity22 also includes a college bookstore chain , but the @entity48 report suggested the @entity1 offer would include only the e-book , digital reader and tablet assets			2
if @entity1 carves the college bookstore chain out of the @entity22 unit , and @entity16 takes back those stores , @entity130 said the valuation of @entity16 could rise even higher			1
while the college bookstore chain has provided @entity16 with much needed cash , sales have been weak			0
in the first three quarters of the fiscal year , sales fell 0.3 percent , while operating profit fell 7 percent to $ 115.8 million			0
the college textbook business is undergoing a transformation with the shift to digital , as publishers move away from large , heavy books that last for years to multiple packages with smaller bites of content			0
companies like @entity147 and @entity11 have started to make plays on the digital textbook market as that shift accelerates			2
earlier this year , @entity16 chairman @entity150 said he wanted to buy the company 's chain of nearly 700 namesake bookstores			2
selling off @entity22 could simplify that process , especially if it reunited @entity150 with the college bookstore business , which he sold to @entity16 in 2009			1
@entity16 first indicated it might spin off the nook business in early 2012 .			1

claims @entity1 will buy nook business lead to 22 *%* rise in @entity16 stock
move would allow @entity1 to take on @entity164 and @entity11 in the *electronic* book market
could also see @entity22 tablets *rebranded* as @entity1 surface tablets
