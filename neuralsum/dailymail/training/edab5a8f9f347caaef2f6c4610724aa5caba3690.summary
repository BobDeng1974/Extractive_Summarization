by @entity0 a health trust which discharged more than 800 suspected cancer patients was warned about its blunders by a gp - but did nothing to stop them for a year			2
an investigation has revealed a clutch of failings at the @entity10 , where 810 patients were not chased up after missing urgent cancer appointments			1
the independent probe was launched earlier this year after it was revealed at least one patient involved in the scandal had died			0
failings : 810 patients were not chased up after missing urgent cancer appointments at the @entity10 , which comprises three hospitals including @entity18 ( pictured ) more than 100 others may have had life - threatening delays thanks to the blunders at the @entity10 , which runs @entity18 , @entity22 and @entity23 in @entity24			1
the patients failed to attend urgent cancer checkups , possibly because they did not receive appointment letters			1
they should have been contacted immediately and offered another appointment within two weeks			0
instead it is thought they were either discharged or given non-urgent appointments			0
now the final report reveals a gp warned there could be a major problem in november 2012 - a full year before the @entity10 launched its investigation			1
the gp 's fears were not followed up because there were not ' appropriate systems ' to deal with complaints , the report said , and there was a ' lack of continuity in leadership '			2
an independent investigation into the blunders at the @entity10 has revealed a @entity5 warned there could be a major problem in november 2012 - a full year before the @entity10 launched its investigation former chief executive : @entity48 left in late 2012 and moved on to @entity49 , @entity50 instead it took another wider review for the blunders to come to light			1
the report said : ' in november 2012 , [ the @entity10 ] received a gp ’s formal complaint that patients referred with suspected cancer on a two - week wait pathway may have been discharged after one did not attend			1
' in response to the investigation clinicians were reminded of the policy			0
the formal complaint response in july 2013 acknowledged the issues and committed to actions to resolve them			1
' as the appropriate systems were not in place to deal with complaints management at that time and due to a lack of continuity in leadership and ownership to address the issues , progress was not followed up			0
' new chief : @entity78 ordered a review of the system for booking appointments in november only at a separate , later training session did it become apparent that patients were not being offered a second appointment , the report said			1
' this was the trigger to instigate the internal incident investigation - @entity87 - in november 2013			1
the gp complaint was reviewed again as part of this investigation			2
' the report , released yesterday , also revealed an audit was promised in july last year but did not happen because ' leadership changes at executive level ' caused confusion as to who was in charge			2
not only were staff unsure who had the final responsibility for ' two - week wait ' cancer patients - the top directors on the hospitals ' board also did not know for sure who was in charge			0
the report added : ' this is a complex , challenged @entity10 and the senior leadership prioritised the known performance issues , giving lower priority to seeking assurance that the performance measures marked green really had no problems			2
' the hospital 's £ 280,000 - a - year former chief executive , @entity48 , left just a month before the @entity5 's complaint and was replaced by @entity78			1
mr @entity48 joined @entity49 but retired just over a year into his post , saying he wanted to focus on @entity118 consultancy and business books			0
ms @entity78 said yesterday the health trust now has a ' comprehensive cancer improvement plan ' in place			0
' i apologise unreservedly to the patients and families affected and wish to assure them that we have already put failsafe mechanisms in place to stop these issues arising again , ' she said			0
' we have published the report to share the findings with our patients and local community			0
' we will continue to work in partnership with local and national health partners to ensure all aspects of the cancer referral pathway can be improved to enhance the patient care experience			0
