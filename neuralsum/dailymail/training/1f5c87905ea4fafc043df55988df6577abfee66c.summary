pope @entity0 today issued a blistering critique of the @entity3 bureaucracy that serves him while delivering a @entity5 message to cardinals , bishops and priests who run the @entity3			1
rather than offering a traditional good - willed festive greeting , the pontiff described how some of those under him lust for power at all costs and lead hypocritical double - lives he suggested others suffer from ' spiritual @entity18 's ' and forget they 're supposed to be joyful men of @entity20 - while offering a sobering catalog of the 15 sins of the @entity23			1
' another of the sins was how cliques can ' enslave their members and become a cancer that threatens the harmony of the body ' and eventually kill it by ' friendly fire '			2
he said : ' @entity23 is called on to always improve itself and grow in communion , holiness and knowledge to fulfill its mission			2
' but even it , as any human body , can suffer from ailments , dysfunctions , illnesses			2
' non-traditional : rather than offering a good - willed festive greeting , the pontiff described how some of those under him lust for power at all costs @entity0 is the first @entity66 pope and never worked in the @entity68 - dominated @entity67 before he was elected			1
he has not shied from complaining about the gossiping , careerism and bureaucratic power intrigues that afflict the @entity3			1
but as his reform agenda has gathered steam , he seemed even more emboldened to highlight what ails the institution			2
the cardinals were not amused			1
the speech was met with tepid applause , and few were smiling as @entity0 listed one by one the @entity80 ' that he had drawn up , complete with footnotes and @entity83 references			1
the annual @entity5 greeting comes at a tense time for the @entity23 , the central administration of the @entity3 which governs the 1.2 - billion strong @entity86			1
not amused : the cardinals in attendance were said to have met the speech with muted applause meticulous : the @entity92 read a list of sins the @entity3 were guilty of - calling it the 15 ailments of the @entity23 @entity0 and his nine key cardinal advisers are drawing up plans to revamp the whole bureaucratic structure , merging offices to make them more efficient and responsive			1
the @entity3 's finances are also in the midst of an overhaul , with @entity0 ' finance czar , cardinal @entity106 , imposing new accounting and budget measures on traditionally independent congregations not used to having their books inspected			1
yet it was perhaps @entity106 that @entity0 had in mind when he complained about the temptation to lust for power even if it means defaming or discrediting others ' even in newspapers or magazines , to show themselves as more capable ... in the name of justice and transparency '			1
@entity106 recently wrote an explosive essay in @entity127 's @entity126 in which he said his team had discovered that the financial situation of the @entity3 was ' much healthier than it seemed because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet '			1
getting tough : the sins on the list included how the ' terrorism of gossip ' can ' kill the reputation of our colleagues and brothers in cold blood ' all smiles : at the end of the speech , @entity0 asked the prelates to pray that the ' wounds of the sins that each one of us carries are healed ' the @entity3 later clarified that the money had n't been hidden and that nothing illicit was going on - just that the funds did n't appear on the @entity3 's balance sheet			1
over the weekend , the @entity154 magazine @entity155 reported that an internal @entity3 memo had undercut @entity106 's claim of having found the cash in the first place			1
it said the funds kept in the @entity3 @entity162 were well - known , duly reported , were used to cover @entity27 losses and special projects and actually had been well - managed over the years			1
@entity0 started off his list with the ' ailment of feeling immortal , immune or even indispensable '			1
then one - by - one he went on : being vain			1
wanting to accumulate things , having a ' hardened heart ' , wooing superiors for personal gain			2
having a ' funereal face ' and being too ' rigid , tough and arrogant , ' also made into on to the shameful list muted applause : few were smiling as @entity0 listed one by one the @entity80 ' that he had drawn up , complete with footnotes and @entity83 references other faults were having a ' funereal face ' and being too ' rigid , tough and arrogant , ' especially toward underlings - a possible reference to the recently relieved @entity180 commander said to have been too tough on his recruits for @entity0 ' tastes			1
some critiques could have been seen as worthy of praise : working too hard and planning too much ahead			2
but even those traits came in for criticism as @entity0 noted that people who do n't take time off to be with family are overly stressed , and those who plan everything to a ' t ' do n't allow themselves to be surprised by the ' freshness , fantasy and novelty ' of the @entity194			1
' how good it is for us to have a healthy sense of humor , ' he said			0
at the end of the speech , @entity0 asked the prelates to pray that the ' wounds of the sins that each one of us carries are healed ' and that the @entity86 and @entity67 itself are made healthy			1
during today 's @entity5 speech @entity0 read out 15 sins that he believed the @entity23 was guilty of complete with footnotes and @entity83 references			1
these included : 1 ) feeling immortal , immune or indispensable			0
' @entity211 that does n't criticize itself , that does n't update itself , that does n't seek to improve itself is a sick body			0
' 2 ) working too hard			0
' rest for those who have done their work is necessary , good and should be taken seriously			0
' 3 ) becoming spiritually and mentally hardened			0
' it 's dangerous to lose that human sensibility that lets you cry with those who are crying , and celebrate those who are joyful			1
' 4 ) planning too much			0
' preparing things well is necessary , but do n't fall into the temptation of trying to close or direct the freedom of the @entity194 , which is bigger and more generous than any human plan			0
' 5 ) working without coordination , like an orchestra that produces noise			0
' when the foot tells the hand , ' i do n't need you ' or the hand tells the head ' i 'm in charge			0
'' 6 ) having ' spiritual @entity18 's			1
' ' we see it in the people who have forgotten their encounter with the lord ... in those who depend completely on their here and now , on their passions , whims and manias , in those who build walls around themselves and become enslaved to the idols that they have built with their own hands			0
' 7 ) being rivals or boastful			0
' when one 's appearance , the color of one 's vestments or honorific titles become the primary objective of life			1
' 8 ) suffering from ' existential schizophrenia			0
' ' it 's the sickness of those who live a double life , fruit of hypocrisy that is typical of mediocre and progressive spiritual emptiness that academic degrees can not fill			1
it 's a sickness that often affects those who , abandoning pastoral service , limit themselves to bureaucratic work , losing contact with reality and concrete people			2
' 9 ) committing the ' terrorism of gossip			0
' ' it 's the sickness of cowardly people who , not having the courage to speak directly , talk behind people 's backs			2
' 10 ) glorifying one 's bosses			2
' it 's the sickness of those who court their superiors , hoping for their benevolence			2
they are victims of careerism and opportunism , they honor people who are n't @entity20			0
' 11 ) being indifferent to others			0
' when , out of jealousy or cunning , one finds joy in seeing another fall rather than helping him up and encouraging him			0
' 12 ) having a ' funereal face			0
' ' in reality , theatrical severity and sterile pessimism are often symptoms of fear and insecurity			0
the apostle must be polite , serene , enthusiastic and happy and transmit joy wherever he goes			0
' 13 ) wanting more			0
' when the apostle tries to fill an existential emptiness in his heart by accumulating material goods , not because he needs them but because he 'll feel more secure			0
' 14 ) forming ' closed circles ' that seek to be stronger than the whole			0
' this sickness always starts with good intentions but as time goes by , it enslaves its members by becoming a cancer that threatens the harmony of the body and causes so much bad — scandals — especially to our younger brothers			0
' 15 ) seeking worldly profit and showing off			2
' it 's the sickness of those who insatiably try to multiply their powers and to do so are capable of calumny , defamation and discrediting others , even in newspapers and magazines , naturally to show themselves as being more capable than others .			2
