working class @entity0 are twice as likely to resort to diet pills as those in richer areas			1
the @entity6 research showed that while the middle - classes sign up for @entity8 , @entity9 and other slimming clubs , those in more deprived areas put their faith in pills and potions			1
these include prescription drugs , herbal remedies and meal replacement drinks			0
the class divide surprised the researchers who speculated that those who are less well off may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix			1
when it comes to diets , wealthier people opt for slimming clubs , while poorer people down diet pills			1
actress @entity31 and @entity32 ( right ) have both attended @entity8 in the past popping a pill may also work out cheaper than paying for week after week of classes			1
researcher dr @entity35 said : ‘ i think one obvious possible reason is that it is sometimes cheaper and quicker to take a pill , or supplement , to help in weight management			1
‘ slimming clubs could be more expensive and people would have to follow weight management strategy over a period of time , rather than just say taking a pill			1
‘ you have to get to a slimming class , spend some time there , pay your £ 4 or £ 5 , go back home and try to adjust every meal you eat			0
‘ whereas , buying something over the counter is something you do perhaps once a month and is quicker in the long - term			0
‘ also , we are a very much a pill taking society			0
it is staggering the amount of pills we take , with the average person taking two a day , for some reason or another			2
’ more than half of the 26,000 people from @entity63 surveyed by dr @entity35 were overweight and almost one in five was obese			1
rates of obesity were highest in deprived areas and among the elderly			0
the most common techniques used to lose weight were eating healthily , cutting back on portions and exercising more			0
those living least well off areas shunned these methods were particularly likely to take weight loss pills , supplements and shakes			1
less well off people may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix from a pill , experts say some four per cent used these ‘ quick fixes ’ , compared to just two per cent of the more affluent slimmers			1
the study also showed that men were more likely to be overweight – 44 per cent compared with just 31 per cent of the women questioned			2
despite this , the men were less worried about their weight			0
dr @entity35 added that our loved of pre-prepared , plastic - wrapped snacks has led to us losing our natural connection with food and eating without thinking			0
' obesity is very much a problem within society in the @entity0			0
we have a cultural difference in our country , where one set of people has a lot of money to spend , and other people do n’t have very much at all , and this changes the way people approach dieting , or weight management			2
‘ so it is very much a societal problem			0
a lot of people are now referred to the @entity116 for weight related problems			2
' but the @entity116 is supposed to be there to treat illness and sickness , so people have been asking is it really the @entity116 ’s problem ? ‘ i do n’t think obesity is a sickness or a disease , say like diabetes , but it is a different kind , it is a societal sickness			2

the less well off ' may be more tempted by the promise of a quick fix '
pills may also work out cheaper than paying for several weeks of classes
study looked at 26,000 people living in @entity63
