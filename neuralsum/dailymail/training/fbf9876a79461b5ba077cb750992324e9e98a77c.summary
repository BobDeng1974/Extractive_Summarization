according to experts , sales were boosted by @entity2 ’s decision to withhold the record from streaming services such as @entity6 , where music can be played for free			1
@entity12 's band @entity2 , show here performing at an @entity9 festival in march , has sold 106,000 copies of its new album @entity10 after signing an exclusive deal with @entity9 provider @entity8 although @entity6 now has 10m subscribers and 40m users ( right ) , artists say the royalties paid by the streaming service are low - which has led to more artists and bands signing exclusively with @entity9 ( left ) instead , @entity2 signed exclusively with the @entity8 - owned music download service , in a bid to increase the sales of full - price albums			1
the band even debuted the album at a special @entity9 concert in march , before allowing the service to stream the record for one week before its official release			2
while individual singles have been made available on @entity6 - and the entire album could appear on the service within the next four months - industry experts say the exclusive deal with @entity8 is likely to have helped sales , according to @entity53			1
the album has also been released two months after @entity12 famously announced he was ' consciously uncoupling ' from his 41 - year - old wife , around the time they went on a family holiday in the @entity56 - something which could have also had an impact			2
@entity13 and the @entity2 frontman , who have two children , told fans in march that they had come to the conclusion that ' while we love each other very much we will remain separate '			0

the album is said to document the ' conscious uncoupling ' of the @entity2 frontman and actress @entity13 , 41 , which the pair announced in march although the interest in the couple 's ' uncoupling ' could be a factor behind the high sales , some say @entity2 's decision to withhold the album from streaming services such as @entity6 are the reason for the impressive sales in the first two days of release @entity70 sold a record number of albums last year after she also gave the release of her self - titled album to @entity9 the @entity93 is another band which has opted to withhold its album from @entity6 , amid criticism that the royalties the streaming service pays are low			1

with @entity6 now having 10m subscribers and 40m users , download sales fell 2.1 per cent last year			0
and @entity10 ’ opening day sales were still 15 per cent lower than the 2011 record @entity106 - the last album to be released by @entity2			2
it means it is unlikely the latest @entity2 album , despite its early success , will match the 464,471 copies which the @entity115 album sold during its first week in 2005			0
after the deal was struck , @entity6 published a message to @entity2 fans saying : ' the artist or their representatives have decided not to release this album on @entity6			0
we are working on it and hope they will change their mind soon			0
' @entity8 is expected to launch its own streaming service after it bought @entity127 - the headphones maker co-founded by @entity129 - which had already begun signing up customers to a new programme			2
but industry insiders said @entity134 , which is owned by @entity135 , still provides a huge challenge to both @entity8 and @entity6			0
