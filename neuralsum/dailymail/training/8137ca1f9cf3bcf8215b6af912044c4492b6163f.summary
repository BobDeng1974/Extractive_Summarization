by @entity0 rising numbers of @entity3 pupils are attending boarding schools despite inflation - busting rises in fees rising numbers of @entity3 pupils are attending boarding schools despite inflation - busting rises in fees as parents demand wraparound childcare , it has been revealed			1
the majority of boarders are full - time but around one in 13 are ‘ flexi ’ which means their families pay for overnight stays whenever they need them as they juggle busy working lives			1
this short - term measure is most common among younger boarders , with around four in ten having ad hoc sleepovers at school			2
the growing popularity in boarding comes even though full fees have reached £ 9,596 a term or £ 28,788 - a - year - up 4.3 per cent on last year			1
this rises to as much as £ 11,168 a term or £ 33,504 a year in some @entity29 boarding schools			1
the @entity30 surveyed 1,209 member schools and found a 4.6 per cent increase in @entity3 - based boarders , from 43,919 last year to 45,958			1
overall , the proportion of boarders rose by one per cent from 66,585 last year to 67,221			2
this brought the total number of @entity30 boarders across the country to 68,453 , taking into account pupils in those independent schools that did not take part in the study last year			2
there was a 0.2 per cent fall in day pupils among the schools surveyed in both years , leading to no percentage change in numbers in @entity30 schools ( 504,362 ) compared to last year			2
however , the total headcount figure currently stands at 511,928 due to the number of new schools joining the @entity30 since the survey was carried out last year			0
the @entity30 report reveals that 83.7 per cent of boarding pupils are full boarders ; 8.4 per cent are weekly and 7.9 per cent are ‘ flexi ’			1
among seven and 11 - year - olds boarders , over 40 per cent are ‘ flexi ’ boarding			1
@entity65 , chairman of the @entity30 and former headmaster of @entity67 , said : ‘ although flexi boarding is still the minority of boarders , quite a lot of families find that they do n’t want to commit to full - time or even weekly boarding			1
‘ they prefer their children to board when it suits the family			0
there ’s all sorts of reasons why it could be very attractive to some parents - if one of them has to suddenly go and work abroad for a few days or if there ’s a mismatch between different children ’s holidays			0
‘ these flexi boarders tend to be from parents who live near the school , can see the benefits of boarding , they want to continue seeing their children and they prefer a flexible arrangement			1
they ’re basically paying for it daily			0
’ referring to the seven to 11 - year - old flexi boarders he added : ‘ what it reflects is the fact that the older the child becomes , the more confident the parents are about full - time boarding			1
’ @entity65 , chairman of the @entity30 and former headmaster of @entity67 , said ' quite a lot of families do n't want to commit to full - time boarding ' mr @entity65 said that the impact of high boarding fees is ‘ significantly ameliorated by the fact that all boarding schools offer quite large numbers of bursaries ’			1
a night ’s occasional boarding typically costs between £ 25 and £ 60 , according to @entity109			0
it says that @entity111 in @entity112 charges its flexi boarders £ 45 but levies an £ 85 fee on any weekly boarder who wishes to spend sunday evening in school			2
some schools , such as @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , offer day pupils ’ one free - night of boarding a week			0
the guide adds : ‘ before you rub your hands at the thought of a cheap baby - sitting service we should caution that it excludes weekends , unless the child is involved in a school or house event			0
‘ @entity135 , national director of the @entity136 , added : ‘ yes , it ’s an expensive option , and there will be parents who will work very long hours in demanding jobs to be able to make such an education available to their child			0
‘ but there will also be hard - working parents who find that boarding is an excellent answer to the problems of childcare out of school hours			2
‘ older children in particular may find short school days leave them with time on their hands that they can not use productively			0
the structured evenings and weekends in boarding schools provide a wealth of opportunity , with facilities and staff on site , to do more than the normal school curriculum and have fun at the same time			0
’ meanwhile the report said that over the last two decades there has been a ‘ shift towards co-education at @entity30 schools and a reduction in the number of schools that cater exclusively for either boys or girls ’			0
the number of single - sex girls schools ‘ has not fallen as fast as the number of single sex boys ’ schools over this period ’ , it adds .			0
