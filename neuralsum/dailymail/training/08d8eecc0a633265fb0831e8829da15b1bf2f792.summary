a disagreement between @entity2 lawmakers over a proposed strategy to block president @entity5 's coming immigration mandate took a nasty turn on thursday as a battle between two powerful factions of the @entity2 spilled into the press			1
on one side of the ring are conservative lawmakers , including rep. @entity13 of @entity14 and sen. @entity15 of @entity16 , who want to insert language into future spending legislation that bars immigration agencies from using their funding to issue the roughly 5 million new work permits the president is expected to authorize tomorrow			1
at the other end are moderates , like @entity25 chairman @entity24 , who do n't want to disrupt the budget process or risk another government shutdown			1
if @entity29 does not pass a new bill disbursing federal funds before dec. 12 , the government will undergo a partial shutdown , with other essential services and staff remaining in place until a new resolution is adopted			2
@entity25 chairman @entity24 , left , is trying to smack him down @entity13 and 62 other @entity48 sent a letter to @entity24 and ranking member on the appropriations committee @entity52 last week to urge them to use the upcoming spending legislation ' to prohibit the use of funds by the administration for the implementation of current or future executive actions that would create additional work permits and green cards outside of the scope prescribed by @entity29			1
' @entity5 's intended actions ' would be in direct violation of @entity67 law , ' they wrote , and @entity29 should use its ' power of the purse ' to stop him ' from implementing policies that are contrary to our laws and the desire of the @entity67 people			2
' signed by vocal @entity75 such as @entity76 of @entity77 , @entity78 of @entity79 , @entity80 of @entity81 , @entity82 of @entity83 , and @entity84 of @entity85 , the letter echos a similar strategy proposed by @entity15 in the @entity87			0
sessions , who will likely ascend to chairman of the @entity87 's budget committee in the next @entity29 , has argued that tying the @entity91 's funding to the president 's immigration order is the best way to keep the president from following through with his plan			1
' @entity29 appropriates the money , ' @entity15 told reporters last week			0
' that 's a clear constitutional power			0
' if @entity29 disapproves of the president providing @entity102 cards for people who 've been in the country illegally , then it should not appropriate money to fund it			0
' sessions favors the approach outlined by his colleagues in the @entity25			2
but in the event the @entity87 's current @entity110 leadership turns it down , he prefers a short - term continuing resolution to fully fund the government through early next year			0
at that point , @entity2 who won seats in the midterm elections will have already been sworn in , padding the @entity2 's numbers in both chambers , and the @entity87 in particular			2
republicans currently hold just 45 seats in the @entity87			0
that number will swell to 53 - potentially 54 depending on the outcome of a dec. 6 run - off election in @entity124 - making the @entity2 the majority party			2
at that point @entity2 would only be a few @entity110 votes shy of a filibuster - proof coalition that could pass long - term legislation funding every aspect of the government but those operations sanctioned @entity91			1
funding for @entity91 would be contingent on @entity5 agreeing to counteract his immigration order by signing the spending bill expressly restricting government money from going toward new green cards and work permits			1
the game plan sets up a scenario in which a shutdown could occur early next year if @entity142 refuse to go along with the @entity2 's scheme or @entity5 withholds his signature from the legislation			1
establishment members of the @entity2 caucus worry that 's exactly what will happen if they go down this path and would like to see immigration untangled from the budget process			1
while they are in complete agreement that @entity5 is overstepping his constitutional authority needs to be reigned in , many of them do not believe the spending debate is the proper avenue to air those grievances			1
a shutdown may not have the intended result and could backfire on the @entity2 the way it did last year when @entity29 allowed the government to close for the first half of october			1
polling afterward showed that the vast majority of @entity67 blamed republicans for the mishap			0
a conservative @entity87 aide involved in developing the strategy told @entity169 that if @entity2 took the two - prong approach to passing the budget , a shutdown would be highly unlikely			1
as long as the president signed the overarching legislation that funds every department but @entity91 , those agencies would stay up and running through the agreed upon date			2
only @entity91 would technically shut down if @entity5 vetoed the second bill			2
and in all actuality , the aide said , much of its operations would continue given that many are deemed ‘ essential			0
' that includes the divisions that handle border patrol , as well as customs and enforcement			0

the president is expected to announce tonight that he will sign an executive order halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants attempting to put the spending fight to bed , @entity24 and other legislators on the appropriations committee issued a statement shooting down tea partiers ' strategy , claiming that the legislative branch does n't have the jurisdiction to cut off funding for the government bureaucracy that would be tasked with carrying out the president 's executive order			1
' the primary agency for implementing the president ’s new immigration executive order is the @entity213 ( @entity213 )			1
this agency is entirely self - funded through the fees it collects on various immigration applications , ' a statement sent out by the committee said			0
' @entity29 does not appropriate funds for any of its operations , including the issuance of immigration status or work permits , with the exception of the ‘ e-verify ’ program , ' it explained			1
' therefore , the appropriations process can not be used to “ defund ” the agency			0
' the agency has the ability to continue to collect and use fees to continue current operations , and to expand operations as under a new executive order , without needing legislative approval by the @entity25 or the @entity29 , even under a continuing resolution or a government shutdown			1
' according to @entity13 , @entity24 also tried to tell conservatives that if they passed a bill now funding the government , they could always take back the money later if they did n't like how the president was using it			1
' chairman @entity24 just got up and said if we pass an omnibus and then the president does this executive amnesty , he said we can rescind it ... and we do n't need the president , ' @entity13 told @entity252 on tuesday			1
' that 's what he just told me			0
i 've never heard that before , ' he stated			0
a @entity2 congressional aide who spoke to @entity169 that ' rescission ' is also bogus and is not possible			1
the aide also said @entity24 claim that @entity29 does n't have the authority to regulate @entity213 ' absurd and patently false			1
' by their logic , the president could do virtually anything it wants if the actions are funded by fees , and @entity29 would be powerless to stop him , ' the aide said			0
' there is simply no way that is the case			0
what ’s really going on here is there are some who want their corporate - backed spending bill so badly they ’d even resort to making ridiculous claims like this			0
' this afternoon sen. @entity15 also sent a statement to reporters explaining that @entity25 appropriators were off base			2
' on its face , the suggestion that the @entity25 can implement any unlawful and unconstitutional act so long as it pays for it with assessed fees is just plain wrong , ' he said			2
' the @entity213 union president has already warned that the agency lacks the resources to properly screen applicants now — and he stressed just last month that the president ’s executive amnesty would make the situation " exponentially worse — and more dangerous , " ' sessions argued			0
continuing , he said , ' the @entity67 people ’s @entity29 has the power and every right to deny funding for unworthy activities			0
it is a routine and constitutional application of congressional power			0
' there is no question that @entity29 has the power to block this expenditure and no doubt that it can be done			0
' the real question here , he said , is ' whether or not @entity110 senators will finally stand up to the president ' by passing a resolution that would effectively block his amnesty measures .			0

@entity5 is expect to issue roughly 5 million illegal immigrants work permits
conservative lawmakers want to use spending legislation to bar immigration agencies from using their funding to for the executive order
the @entity25 , led by chairman @entity24 , said today they legally ca n't do that
a @entity2 aide told @entity169 that is ' absurd and patently false '
establishment @entity2 are worried that route will lead to a shutdown
