a vicar who complained about ' blasphemous ' comments made by @entity2 has been told by the @entity3 that ' offensive language is just a part of everyday life '			1
the @entity7 said he was ' surprised and upset ' after the @entity9 presenter shouted ' @entity10 wept ' and ' @entity11 ' during a show on march 4			1
the 52 - year - old has vowed never to watch the motoring programme again after receiving an ' unsatisfactory ' response from the broadcaster , which claimed ' there is no consensus about words that are acceptable '			2
' offensive ' : the @entity7 , left , said @entity2 had ' trivialised , belittled and cheapened ' his faith no apology : @entity2 's comments were made in a episode of @entity9 that aired on march 4			1
he shouted ' @entity10 wept ' while driving a @entity27 open stop sports car in the rain from his home in @entity30 ' double standards ' : the @entity3 told @entity32 that @entity2 's words are ' a part of everyday language ' mr @entity7 , of @entity37 's church , in @entity38 - on - @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ' i thought @entity9 was great before this			1
' but i found @entity2 's comments very offensive and i think many @entity43 would			1
' they belittled , trivialised and cheapened @entity10 and @entity45			1
i was really quite surprised as he is a @entity3 presenter and it is blasphemous			2
' there are many normal , honest people who i think would have been offended			0
@entity2 has a long history of controversy			2
in december he sparked fury for a series of @entity54 style digs at @entity57 's clothing , trains , toilets , food and history			0
and last year the @entity3 apologised about an item on @entity63 's @entity9 which led to the @entity65 ambassador complaining about the ' outrageous , vulgar and inexcusable insults ' made about @entity65 by @entity2 and co-hosts @entity67 and @entity69			1
the @entity3 ’s editorial complaints unit upheld criticisms of the show and ruled that it reinforced stereotypes			2
@entity2 was also roundly condemned earlier this year for comments he made about the energy saving mode on his new television which , he said , made every programme look ' like it 's being presented by @entity78 in a cave			1
' after those comments , war hero @entity80 , 31 , from @entity81 , said : ' remarks like this just are n’t funny			0
' in february 2009 , @entity2 famously called then - prime minister @entity87 a ' one - eyed @entity89 idiot ' and in november the previous year , the @entity3 received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes			1
' sometimes the @entity93 and @entity43 are belittled and cheapened , and sometimes we deserve it , to be honest			2
' i also drew attention to double standards between the way the @entity3 deals with @entity45 and @entity100			1
i 'm delighted the @entity3 treats @entity100 with such respect			1
' i just wish they would treat @entity45 with some			2
' mr @entity7 has also made a complaint to the watchdog @entity104			2
in a statement – which the vicar said was the same response he received – a @entity3 spokesman said : ' there is no consensus about words that are acceptable , when , and by whom , as different words cause different offence to different people			0
' some of the words and phrases that can cause offence have , whether we like it or not , become part of everyday language and it would be unrealistic for broadcasters to suggest they are not widely used in a range of contexts			0
' we do however respect the fundamental human right to exercise freedom of thought , conscience and religion , this includes an individual ’s freedom to worship , teach , practice and observe			0
' while we also have a duty to reflect society as it really is , we try to ensure our output is not used to denigrate the beliefs of others			0
' however , @entity32 was unhappy with the response , branding it a ' non reply ' , and has vowed never to watch @entity9 again			1
' it did not really engage with my concerns at all , ' he added			0
' so far , i have not heard @entity2 apologise for anything and mean it			0
part of me did n’t want to go very public with this because he might need this type of publicity for his career			0
' i wo n’t be watching again			0
i ca n’t risk the offence			0
' @entity32 has also complained to @entity104 , and is awaiting a response			0
@entity2 ’s comments were made in a episode of @entity9 that aired on march 4			1
he shouted ' @entity10 wept ' while driving a @entity27 open stop sports car in the rain from his home in @entity30 to the show ’s studio at @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161 , and blurted out ‘ @entity11 ’ as he was behind the wheel of a @entity163 powered by a @entity165 engine			1
it is not the first time @entity9 has offended @entity43			0
the 2010 @entity169 edition of the show caused anger with a nativity scene that depicted the new @entity173 - the show ’s mystery test driver - as the baby @entity10 .			0
