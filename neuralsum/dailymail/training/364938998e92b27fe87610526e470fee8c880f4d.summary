by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 04:40 est , 6 december 2012 boost : large businesses yesterday scooped a £ 3billion tax cut which will slash corporation tax to the lowest rate of any major western economy			1
chancellor @entity6 , left , is pictured yesterday large businesses yesterday scooped a £ 3billion tax cut which will slash corporation tax to the lowest rate of any major western economy			1
in a surprise move , @entity6 said the rate will drop to 21 per cent in 2014 , sending a clear message that @entity13 is ‘ open for business ’			1
it is the fourth time the chancellor has used either a budget or an autumn statement to cut the key corporate tax rate			1
in may 2010 – the month mr @entity6 became chancellor – corporation tax was 28 per cent for large businesses which make profits of more than £ 300,000 a year			1
the tax cut is significant			2
official figures , published yesterday by the @entity25 , show it will save firms £ 415million in 2014/15 , rising to £ 785million the following year			1
in the following two years , it will be worth £ 875million in each year , making a total of £ 2.96billion			2
the chancellor , the son of two entrepreneurs , said he wanted @entity13 to have ‘ the most competitive business tax regime of any major economy ’			2
he said the tax cut was ‘ an advert for our country that says , “ come here , invest here , create jobs here			2
@entity13 is open for business ”			0
’ @entity41 , head of taxation at the @entity43 , the business lobby group , said the move should help the private sector to create jobs at a time when unemployment is 2.5million			2
he added : ‘ reducing the tax burden for all businesses is the most straightforward way to help them expand and take on more staff			0
’ the @entity43 wants corporation tax to drop to 15 per cent			1
but experts warned yesterday of a sting in the tail of the corporation tax cut through a crippling back - door tax hike in business rates			1
worrying : big chains such as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , pictured , have either disappeared or have lost hundreds of outlets each year , the increase in business rates , which comes into force in april , is linked to the previous september ’s @entity72 figure , which was 2.6 per cent			2
the massive increase will hit businesses , particularly small shops – many of which are struggling to survive			0
@entity77 , director general of the @entity78 , said he will continue to campaign for a freeze in business rates following two years of punishing increases			0
‘ the chancellor ’s failure to offer immediate support for struggling high streets by announcing a business rates freeze is disappointing			0
‘ a third successive , substantial rates hike will deliver a further blow to investment and job creation			0
’ mr @entity77 said recent increases had already hit the high streets , resulting in empty shops and redundancies			0
one in every nine shops is lying empty			0
some 32 shops closed every day over the summer , raising the spectre of yet more high streets turning into ‘ ghost towns ’			0
big chains such as @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 have either disappeared or have lost hundreds of outlets			0
as a result , town centres are seeing more pawnbrokers , bookmakers , charity shops , coffee shops , payday loan firms and convenience stores run by the ‘ big four ’ supermarkets			0
firms struggling to survive the tough economic climate have been handed a huge increase in the value of their tax breaks for investment in new machinery			2
at present , they enjoy tax relief on £ 25,000 of investment each year			1
from 1 january , it will jump tenfold to £ 250,000 for the next two years in a move which will cost the @entity25 nearly £ 1.6billion			1
but last night the @entity124 called for ‘ stability ’ , criticising the fact that the annual allowance has fluctuated over the past few years , knocking business confidence			0
@entity129 , from the institute , said : ‘ businesses like certainty above everything and the chopping and changing of the annual investment allowance has been a problem			0
’ a @entity138 spokesman said : ‘ the increase is welcome but it is also a tacit admission that the decision to cut the same allowance to £ 25,000 this year was a wrong one			1
‘ given that @entity13 businesses are currently sitting on £ 700billion of cash reserves , it could be argued that the earlier actions of the chancellor created a disincentive to invest through 2012 , at a time when business needs confidence to create growth			1
’ in a further boost for business , 500,000 small businesses will benefit from the chancellor ’s decision to extend a crucial exemption which allows them to escape paying business rates			0
mr @entity6 said the small business rate relief holiday , which had been due to end in april , will be extended by a year			1
it allows small firms with a rateable value of up to £ 6,000 to pay no business rates , and cuts bills for larger firms with a rateable value of up to £ 12,000			0
mr @entity6 said 330,000 will pay no business rates at all , equal to an average saving of £ 1,650 , with a further 150,000 paying lower rates as a result of the extension .			1

in a surprise move @entity6 said the rate will drop to 21 per cent in 2014
it is the fourth time the chancellor has used either a budget or an autumn statement to cut the key corporate tax rate
@entity25 figures show it will save firms £ 415million in 2014/15 - rising to £ 785million the following year
