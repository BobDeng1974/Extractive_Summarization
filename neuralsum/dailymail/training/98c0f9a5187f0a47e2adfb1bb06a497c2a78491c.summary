by @entity0 young women who go through the menopause have a higher risk of suffering ' brain fog ' , warn researchers young women who go through the menopause have a higher risk of suffering ‘ brain fog ’ , warn researchers			1
a study shows they appear to have more trouble with many cognitive functions including memory and coordination			0
in the @entity17 , the average age of the menopause is 51 years , when women ’s ovaries run out of eggs and they can no longer have children			1
a @entity17 study last year found one in 20 women had gone through an early menopause , which can occur from the teens onwards			1
there may be no medical reason , or it may be caused by medical treatment including hysterectomy			0
the loss of oestrogen means women lose their natural protection against heart disease and thinning bones			1
but premature menopause may have long - term deleterious effects on brain function , says a new study in @entity41 : an @entity42			1
almost 5,000 post-menopausal women were given cognitive tests at the start of the study and then after two , four and seven years			1
around 7.6 per cent of the women in the study had a premature menopause and a further 13 per cent had an early menopause between 41 and 45 years			1
over a fifth of the women used hormone treatment ( @entity54 ) during the menopause			2
in comparison to women going through the menopause after 50 , those with a premature menopause did worse on a range of brain function tests			2
they were 40 per cent more likely to perform badly in verbal fluency and visual memory tests			0
they were also 35 per cent more at risk of a decline in psychomotor speed , the coordination between the brain and the muscles that brings about movement , and overall cognitive function over 7 years			0
premature menopause may have long - term deleterious effects on brain function , says a new study in @entity41 : an @entity42 there was no greater risk of dementia			2
@entity54 to alleviate the effects of premature menopause helped visual memory , but could increase the risk of poor verbal fluency			0
study leader dr @entity86 at the @entity87 , @entity88 , said ‘ both premature surgical menopause and premature ovarian failure , were associated with long - term negative effects on cognitive function , which are not entirely offset by menopausal hormone treatment			0
’ @entity94 , @entity41 deputy editor - in - chief said ‘ with the ageing population it is important to have a better understanding of the long term effects of a premature menopause on later - life cognitive function and the potential benefit from using menopausal hormone treatment			0
‘ this study adds to the existing evidence base to suggest premature menopause can have a significant impact on cognitive function in later life which healthcare professionals must be aware of			0
