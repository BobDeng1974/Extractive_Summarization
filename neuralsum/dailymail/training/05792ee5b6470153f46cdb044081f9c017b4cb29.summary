there are robots to fight fires , to perform operations , to build cars and even to explore space			0
now a @entity13 company has developed a truly useful automaton - one that will free us forever from the indignity of dancing to popular music			0
he 's perhaps not the greatest dancer : but @entity20 could revolutionise human life by freeing us from the indignity of dancing to the latest pop hits walk like an @entity23 : or , alternatively , get @entity20 to do it for you dubbed @entity20 , the dancing robot turned heads this week at @entity29 's @entity28 technology trade show by strutting its stuff to the music of @entity32 and , that late dancer extraordinaire , @entity33			1
the compact android , which incorporates a high - quality compact speaker in its midriff , amazed crowds with its decidedly camp dance moves - even donning a @entity33 - style sparkling fedora to complete the look			0
@entity42 , the company behind the @entity20 , claim it is the ' recipe for the ultimate party '			1
' you can have it all with @entity20 , the one - of - a - kind gadget that is a unique fusion of a high quality portable speaker and a dancing robot , ' the company says			1
' once the music starts , the @entity20 will come alive and transform into a full - body dancing robot with his signature moves			1
' slightly camp : but @entity42 , the company behind the @entity20 , claim it is the ' recipe for the ultimate party ' high tech : @entity20 contains @entity60 of flash memory to store all your favourite music			1
it 's is capable of analysing beats and rhythms to bust a move to ' virtually any ' genre of music according to reports , the @entity20 weighs just 3.3lb and boasts @entity60 of onboard memory that can be stocked up with you favourite tunes via a usb connection			1
in an echo of the classic transformers villain @entity76 , @entity20 folds for compact , easy storage			2
but as soon as you press play it transforms from mundane portable stereo into a raving robot			0
it can even do voguing : any resemblance to @entity83 villain @entity76 is purely coincidental it dances with pre-programmed routines , but @entity42 say @entity20 is capable of analysing beats and rhythms to bust a move to ' virtually any ' genre of music			2
the integrated speaker has a claimed frequency response as low as @entity92 - not quite deep enough for those bassy dub reggae jams but more than capable of handling bubblegum pop. the @entity20 was first unveiled in its prototype stage in january by none other than pubescent pop star @entity97			2
it 's still in development , but @entity42 say its expected to ship early in 2013 .			0

@entity20 's *makers* claim it is the ' recipe for the ultimate party '
