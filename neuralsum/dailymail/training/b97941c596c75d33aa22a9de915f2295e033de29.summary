by @entity0 @entity2 's adopted son will open up about the years of sexual abuse he endured at the hands of his pedophile father in an exclusive interview with @entity7			1
@entity9 's interview , which will air on @entity10 at 9pm on thursday night , will be his first television since his father was convicted in 2012			1
' at bedtime , his ritual began , ' he says in a 30 - second preview clip for the show			2
ahead of the show 's airing , @entity10 explained that @entity9 would be sharing ' a deeply personal account of the grooming , methodical control and manipulation he faced as a child '			0
@entity9 , who retired in june 30 , 1999 as @entity38 's defensive coordinator , was convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over 15 years , some in the football team 's showers on campus			1
the 70 - year - old is now serving a 30 - to 60 - year state prison sentence			1
@entity46 , one of six children adopted by @entity2 and @entity34 , had been expected to be a defense witness for his father until the trial , when he told investigators that he also had been abused			1
his story first became public when a secret tape of a 29 - minute interview he did with police during the middle of his father 's trial was leaked to @entity60			2
pedophile : @entity2 , pictured in january 2013 , was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for his crimes in the tape , @entity46 said his father would enter his bedroom at night and ' blow raspberries ' on his stomach , then move his hand down his body , rubbing up against his genitals			1
he said he would sometimes cower ' in a fetal position ' in his bed trying to avoid his father			0
in total , he said he suffered seven years of molestation , between the ages of eight and 15 , at the hands of his adoptive father			2
he initially denied there had been any abuse before speaking out			0
in an interview for a documentary at the @entity82 in january , he said that he felt ' betrayed ' by the entire @entity9 family after he took the decision to speak out against his father			2
but he maintains that he refused to be a ' coward ' and risked everything to turn against those who had adopted him from a deprived upbringing and brought him up in an affluent household			0
last year he reached a settlement with @entity38 and petitioned to legally change his name , and that of his wife and four children			0
hurtful : @entity9 said he felt betrayed by his adopted mother @entity95 , right in 2011 , after they failed to support him when he came forward with allegations about his father 's abuse the interview comes two weeks after @entity102 's attorney general released a review of the prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by then governor @entity107			1
the report , however , did reveal three years of ' inexplicable delays ' to prosecute the former @entity38 football coach on child abuse charges			0
the pedophile 's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year , from march 2009 until march 2010 , for the office to recommend charging @entity9 when ' @entity117 ' came forward			0
it took more 18 months before @entity9 was arrested because the prosecutor 's supervisors believed the testimony of one victim would be ' insufficient against a community icon like @entity9 '			0

@entity9 *previously* told investigators that he suffered seven years of sexual abuse at the hands of his adopted father
on thursday , he will speak out in his first tv interview since @entity2 was convicted and sentenced to 30 - 60 years in 2012
