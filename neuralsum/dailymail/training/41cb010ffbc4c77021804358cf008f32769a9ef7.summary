by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 was 14 when he discovered he had not quite got to the pitch of the ball in a first @entity5 game for @entity6 against @entity7 rivals @entity8			1
but he did n’t panic			2
extending his hands through the shot , he deposited the @entity12 ’s off - spinner over extra cover for six			1
then he did it again			2
his coach was @entity16 , the former @entity17 and @entity18 slow left - armer			1
‘ he just went “ bump ”			2
you ca n’t coach that sort of thing			2
’ by the time @entity1 was 16 , and averaging almost 95 as @entity29 ’s captain , @entity16 reckoned he was a ‘ better cricketer ability-wise than @entity30 at that age ’			1
until then @entity16 , who is still head groundsman at the school , believed the best 16 - year - old he had seen was his old @entity17 team - mate @entity33			1
‘ then i saw @entity1			1
’ with @entity36 cricket aching for a good - news story , there is of course the risk of saddling a @entity41 debutant with an impossible burden			1
and so far @entity1 ’s most eye - catching deeds — not least an incendiary 74 - ball 121 in a one - dayer against @entity45 at @entity46 ’s two months ago — have come in the limited - overs arena			1
natural talent : a teenage @entity1 at @entity6 in 2006 @entity49 deserves his chance but it would take a peculiarly @entity36 kind of conservatism to play down the potential of the nation ’s new wicketkeeper - batsman			1
unsurprisingly , that conservatism has already had an airing			2
after the fireworks at @entity61 , @entity59 suggested @entity1 , 23 , was not ready for @entity41			1
it felt like an unnecessary slap on the wrist			2
yet the demise of @entity65 means he can set about laying the angst to rest , starting with sunday ’s third test against @entity70 in @entity71			1
there will be failures along the way			0
but for those who knew him growing up , there is little doubt he will make the job his			0
‘ i ’ve got a bet on that he ’ll be @entity21 captain in five years , ’ said @entity16			1
‘ odds of 14 - 1			2
’ how much did he wager ? a slight pause			0
‘ i had a nice bet			0
’ promise : @entity1 was better cricketer ability-wise than @entity21 legend @entity30 at 16 @entity86 , the @entity18 head coach who was in charge when @entity1 first played top - level cricket at the age of 18 in 2009 , remembers the smallest of cameos that year at the @entity92 in @entity70			1
‘ our last game was against @entity95 and he had to face @entity96			0
he dealt with it superbly			0
’ @entity1 faced just three balls from the @entity100 paceman , scoring three runs			1
but @entity86 had seen enough			0
‘ you find out quickly if someone can make the step up mentally			0
’ @entity1 ’s @entity105 might be his one - day international strike - rate , which is a frightening 128 , and the full spectrum of strokes			1
but what of his other talents ? @entity86 said : ‘ first , he ’s a student of the game			0
he wants to be the best he can			0
he speaks to the senior players a lot to find out ways of improving			0
he has incredible hand - eye coordination and belief			1
i ’ve got no issues at all about whether he ’ll make the step up			0
’ there is passion , too			0
@entity16 recalls @entity1 ’s reaction to his dismissal after making a century against @entity123 aged 14			1
‘ he got out just before we won , and he cried			0
he ’s a genuinely nice guy			0
’ @entity126 ’s batting was more attuned to white - ball than red - ball cricket have been assuaged this summer following his move from @entity18 to @entity130			2
playing for a team that is facing relegation , he has averaged 40 , with one hundred and five 50s			2
‘ he ’s a long way down the road with his batting compared to where he was , ’ said @entity86			0
‘ he ’s batting higher up the order and is moving forward			0
’ @entity86 and @entity16 still follow @entity1 ’s progress , with a mixture of pride and anxiety			1
‘ i wo n’t be going to @entity71 , ’ said @entity16			0
‘ the school are trying to get me to go , but i ’ll be too nervous			2
’ he might be talking for everyone in @entity36 cricket .			0
