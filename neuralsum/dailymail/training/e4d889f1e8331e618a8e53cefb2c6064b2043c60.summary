by @entity0 published : 12:26 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 14:16 est , 4 december 2012 like any parent , @entity1 would do anything for her baby daughter			2
so when she was given the option of saving her life , she certainly did n't think twice			0
ms @entity1 from @entity7 , @entity8 , gave part of her own liver to 13 - month - old @entity11 who was awaiting a transplant			1
@entity11 was diagnosed with biliary atresia when she was just nine weeks old			1
the rare condition meant that @entity11 was born without any bile ducts , making it impossible for her to break down fats in her diet , causing a severe strain on her liver			1
@entity11 had been on the transplant list for five months but it soon become clear that urgent action was needed to save her life			1
and after a friend mentioned to ms @entity1 , 34 , and partner @entity35 , the possibility of donation from a living donor , the couple never looked back			1
@entity11 ( with parents @entity40 and @entity35 ) was born without any bile ducts , making it impossible for her to break down fats in her diet , causing a severe strain on her liver ms @entity1 said : ' when i found out that it was possible to take a liver from a living person it was a no brainer , i knew i was going to give mine to @entity11			1
' i 'd cut my arm off for my little girl if i someone needed me to , so i really did n't think twice about it			0
' @entity11 was initially diagnosed with the condition this time last year , just a few days before @entity59			2
her mother said : ' her newborn jaundice never cleared so we took her to the doctors			0
i was n't really concerned at the time , i just thought it would be something minor			0
' but the doctor booked us in for blood tests at the hospital and on christmas eve , she was being operated on			0
it was a really scary time			0
' mother and daughter both went under the knife on september 5th and are recovering well the aim of @entity11 's initial operation was to re-plumb her liver in the hope that bile could be emptied from the liver and she could be cured			1
however , after three hours under the knife , it became clear that the operation had not been successful			0
the family was forced to spend @entity59 day in hospital with just three other people on the ward			0
shortly afterwards , they learned of the living liver transplant procedure			1
' we got the ball rolling straight away , ' said ms @entity1			1
' you need to go through quite a lot , and before i could have any tests to see if i was compatible i had to loose about 30lbs , so it was about may or june time before they would even start looking at me			0
' when i lost the weight i had to have scans of my liver , an abdomen @entity99 , and numerous x-rays			0
i had 18 blood samples taken in a single day at one point - and i 'm scared of needles ! ' we then got a date for the donation at the end of july but the doctor felt we should wait as long as possible to give @entity11 as much time with her own liver as possible , so it was n't until the end of august that the operation went ahead			2
' the left side of @entity40 's liver was removed to be given to @entity11			1
because the liver regenerates , the right side of @entity40 's liver will grow to compensate the missing piece			1
@entity11 will also grow a full - sized liver mother and daughter both went under the knife on september 5 this year - when @entity11 was just 11 months old			1
' i think @entity35 was in a meltdown , ' recalled ms @entity1			1
' having both of his girls under anaesthetic at the same time - and in two different hospitals - was just awful for him			0
' in the complex operations that took a massive nine hours to complete , the left side of @entity40 's liver was removed at @entity129 in @entity130 and whisked over to @entity131 to be given to @entity11			1
the liver regenerates , meaning that the right side of @entity40 's liver will grow to compensate the missing piece			1
the left side of the liver given to @entity11 , will also grow to a full sized liver			1
following the operation , ms @entity1 had to wait an agonising six days before she got to see her daughter			1
' luckily the transplant coordinator took lots of pictures for me so i could see that she was @entity142			0
' but when i saw her it was just lovely and she did brilliantly			0
she got out of intensive care before i did			0
' she added : ' we 've both been recovering really well			0
i tend to get quite tired but @entity11 just has n't looked back - it 's like she 's pressed fast forward			2
' if i had n't given @entity11 part of my liver , we could still be going to bed every night wondering if we 'd be woken up with a phone call telling us they 'd found a donor			2
' so may people die waiting for transplants - @entity11 could so easily not have made it			2
' throughout the process , @entity11 's family have been busy raising money for the @entity159			2
the family and their friends have also managed to raise £ 40,000 for the @entity159 during @entity11 's treatment ms @entity1 explained : ' we 've done a bit of fundraising to say thank you			1
@entity35 did the great @entity168 - and lost 5 stone to do it - and we 've also held a charity ball with a yellow theme			0
' overall we 've raised about £ 40,000 - we 're just really pleased we could help			0
' @entity172 , chief executive of @entity159 , said : ' it is wonderful to see @entity11 doing so well now and i 'm sure this @entity59 will be a really special one for the family			2
' @entity159 has been in contact with @entity177 and @entity40 ever since @entity11 was diagnosed with biliary atresia , providing information about her condition as well as emotional support			1
' the amazing thing about this family is that during a truly anxious and worrying time they have enabled a huge amount of fundraising for us - £ 40,000 to date			0
@entity189 , lead nurse for living donation at @entity191 , said : ' it is wonderful that this family have had the opportunity to restore their lives through a living liver transplant for their daughter			1
' most liver transplants are carried out using organs that are donated after death and , whilst overall numbers remain stable , many patients die waiting for a suitable organ to become available			2
' due to welcome advances in road safety and prevention of catastrophic strokes through early detection and treatment of high blood pressure , the number of organs available for transplantation has fallen			0
' i strongly urge everyone to join the @entity218 so that you can help someone who is in need of a life - saving organ transplant like @entity11			2
' call the @entity223 now on 0300 123 23 23 or go to www.organ donation.nhs.uk			0
most importantly , let your family know of your wishes			0
