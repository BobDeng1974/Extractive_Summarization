by @entity0 dogs are stepping in to find birds that may be severely injured at a @entity4 solar power plant			1
141 birds were found dead between july 2012 and december 2013 at @entity6 , according to an april report by the @entity8 obtained by kcet			1
47 of those birds were killed by solar flux while 24 birds were killed by impact trauma			0
temperatures at @entity6 's ' power tower ' reach 800 degrees @entity16 , the report said			1
as part of its multiple suggestions , the report encouraged using dogs to better report the number of birds that died or suffered injuries at the plant			2
burned : a @entity25 , part of the @entity27 report , is seen with some of its flight feathers affected because of solar flux curled : a @entity34 's wing , also part of the report , is damaged by solar flux at @entity6 , birds that suffered solar flux experienced ' feather curling , charring , melting and / or breakage and loss ' and ' flight feathers of the tail and / or wings were invariably affected , ' the report said			1
the @entity43 , part of the @entity45 , noticed ' streamers ' at @entity6			0
' indeed @entity43 staff observed birds entering the solar flux and igniting , consequently becoming a streamer , ' the report said			2
the solar power plant was also deemed a ' mega-trap ' for multiple species by the report 's authors			1
' [ @entity6 attracts ] insects which in turn attract insect - eating birds , which are incapacitated by solar flux injury , thus attracting predators and creating an entire food chain vulnerable to injury and death , ' the report said			2
a report filed by energyservices with the @entity68 in may and obtained by @entity69 reported 80 dead birds at the power plant in may			1
many of the birds were listed in the report as suffering burn injuries			0

birds are seen with varying degrees of solar flux damage damaged : a peregrine falcon wing is seen with evidence of solar flux helpers : eight dogs are currently working at @entity6 , pictured , to find the birds however , researchers found that dogs , when paired with handlers , were able to find 68 % of dead small bird species and 71 % of dead large bird species			1
in the wake of the findings , eight dog teams are currently being used at @entity6 , @entity103 reported			0
' the dogs do love their work , ' @entity107 of @entity81 and @entity82 told the website			0
' their reward is play			0
