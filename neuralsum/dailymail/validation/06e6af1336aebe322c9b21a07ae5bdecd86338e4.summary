just when we thought the @entity2 awards could take no more nominees , meet the people posing with the largest and most dangerous reptile in the world , all for a selfie			2
photos and video have appeared on social media of two young women smiling , posing and snapping photos with large crocodiles at @entity2 's @entity14			1
in the video , a woman can be seen to be unfazed by the beast and takes nonchalant snaps mere metres from it 's jaws			2
in another case , on @entity31 , a woman poses with another large crocodile for a selfie , captioning the image by stating she did not want to get much closer , even though she was just over a metre from its claws			2
the @entity50 is littered with signs to warn people of the dangers of crocodiles the @entity55 of the @entity50 have issued a direct warning to those wanting to snap a selfie with a crocodile			0
they have warned the public to be ' crocwise ' and keep a safe distance of at least 15 metres			0
the @entity50 is notorious for its freshwater and saltwater crocodile population , with certain areas averaging 15 crocodiles per kilometre			0
salt water crocodiles can grow to five metres in length , weigh 450 kilograms and last year killed more people than any other year with the ' freshies ' remaining more timid and fearful			1
however , this does not rule out the possibility of an attack by a freshwater crocodile , especially with passerby 's getting too close for comfort			0
just last january , a 12 - year - old boy was taken by a crocodile while swimming with friends in a river in @entity82			1
as more and more people arrive to take photos , the distressed crocodile wanders back down the bank and in june a 62 - year - old man was taken , also in @entity82 , whilst he was fishing in his boat when a five - metre salt water crocodile launched itself into the boat , grabbing him and dragging him under the water while his distressed family watched from the river bank			1
even though the state is riddled with recognisable crocodile warning signs , tourists and locals seem to be downplaying the dangers for that next level selfie .			0
