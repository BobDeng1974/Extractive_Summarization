she said she needs more money from the government in order to improve her health			0
personal trainer @entity29 , author of the @entity30 , told @entity31 : ' getting fit does n't have to cost you a penny and eating healthily can certainly be cheaper than takeaways and fast food			1
' you do n't need to have access to a health club or to pay a trainer to start exercising			2
even as a trainer myself , i often do n't use any kit at all in my own workouts			2
in fact , for beginners or people who have a lot weight to lose , a few basic equipment - free moves might be the best way to get started			1
' most people have a pair of trainers they can put on and go out for a walk , jog or run ( depending on their fitness level )			1
if you have internet access you have no excuse at all because @entity61 is full of free videos where professional trainers demonstrate exercises			1
' she added : ' if you have a bit more to spend , gym membership is now cheaper than ever before with some clubs charging less than £ 15 per month			1
even getting professional coaching is now more affordable than ever with the help of the internet - i offer online fitness programmes from just £ 10 per week ( so less than the price of a takeaway ) with full support from me personally			0
go for a run : it costs nothing to take a jog around your local park ' in my book @entity84 , i outline a full 12 - week programme of exercises which has got thousands of people into fantastic shape by training at home , with just a few basic pieces of equipment			1
' as @entity29 pointed out , keeping fit does n't have to be expensive as anyone can go out for a brisk walk or run			1
while kit from some sports brands can be costly , supermarkets now stock fitness clothing at much more affordable prices			0

the runs are open to all ages and abilities and you do n't have to pay to take part			0
you just turn up and walk or run round the course			2
@entity29 added that when it comes to healthy eating , you do n't have to spend a lot either			1
healthy eating : @entity125 and stir - fried vegetables is a cheap and easy to make meal that 's low in fat she said : ' it has been shown time and again that you can eat healthily on a limited budget			1
if you can afford to buy takeaways you can certainly afford to eat healthily , it 's more about where you 're choosing to spend your income and the choices you 're making			2
' think about it , for about 30p you can buy an apple , or an egg , or a courgette			0
plus healthy foods give you more energy and make you feel fuller for longer , so you do n't end up constantly reaching for more the way you do when eating junk food			1

she told @entity31 : ' eating less meat and more vegetarian protein can actually save you money , e.g. beans , lentils or pulses , and canned or frozen fruits and vegetables are often cheaper and just as nutritious as their fresh alternatives			0
' high fat takeaways often cost more than a home - prepared healthy meal e.g. beans on toast with mushrooms			2
buying fatty and sugary snacks means paying for ' empty calories ' ( calories with no nutrients ) which can contribute to weight gain if eaten in excess ! ' @entity29 urges people like @entity4 to take some responsibility for their own health for their own good			1
she said : ' it 's such a shame that people do n't put more value on their own health , we all know the obesity crisis is putting a huge strain on the economy , there 's nothing cheap about that ! budget buy : these @entity101 running shoes cost £ 14.99 ' the benefits of being fit and healthy are priceless , i know it can be hard to get started , but please do n't use money as an excuse , it 's a question of priorities , if you can afford takeaways , you can afford to be fit and healthy if you really want to be			1

these people may have a basic understanding of what encompasses a healthy lifestyle , however they may not have the education to make the choices , nor the knowledge on how to prioritise their own lives in order to get them there			0
' the reality is that with a little planning and creativity , eating fresh and healthy is actually far less of a strain on the wallet , especially when planning meals for the whole family			2
' when it comes to exercise , simply going for a short walk or light jog is the perfect place to start for beginners			0
the first step is always the hardest , but if you want to make the commitment to change , i guarantee that it will be the best thing that will happen in your life			0
