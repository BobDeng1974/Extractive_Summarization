a 17 year - old college student could face a battle with @entity2 after hacking the popular photo - sharing app. @entity5 , a @entity6 high school student , recently developed a $ 4.99 app for @entity9 devices using @entity2 's application program interface			1
called ' uploader for @entity2 ' , it allows users to upload photos to @entity2 directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone			1
@entity5 , a @entity6 high school student , has developed a $ 4.99 ( £ 3.24 ) app for @entity9 devices using @entity2 's application program interface ( screen shot pictured )			1
now , the 17 year - old student could face a battle with @entity2 over hackings its @entity23 according @entity25 at @entity26 , the teenager is currently making $ 1,000 ( £ 675.70 ) a day from the app – and @entity2 is n't happy			1
an engineer from @entity29 , which owns @entity2 , sent @entity5 an email last week claiming the app violated the company 's terms of service			1
the email asked @entity5 to ' fix ' the app by monday , but @entity5 said doing this would make the app would be pointless			1
' to be honest , i was n't nonplussed when i got the email from @entity29 , ' @entity5 told @entity40			1
' i knew my app was playing in a legal gray area , and i suspected @entity29 would find out about it somehow			1
' @entity29 has strict restrictions against using its private @entity23			1
an engineer from @entity2 allegedly sent @entity5 an email last week , claiming the app violated the company 's terms of service			1
pictured on the right is a screenshot of the ' uploader for @entity2 ' service @entity53 , a @entity54 technologist told @entity26 the problem is that accessing the @entity23 ' opens up possibilities for all kinds of abuse , from spambots or people uploading stuff from other channels			1
' one in five @entity2 users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. to capitalise on this , the @entity6 firm has launched its latest standalone app called layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations			2
photos can be selected from the phone 's camera roll , or taken with the @entity79 tool , and layouts can then be ' remixed ' and edited with mirror effects and flips			0
the layout app has four main features called @entity85 , mirroring , @entity79 and @entity86			0
users begin by selecting as many images , up to the maximum of nine , to feature in the collage			0
photos can be selected or deselected at any point			0
as they add more images , the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired			0
these photos can then be zoomed , flipped to form a mirror image , or turned upside down			0
he added , if @entity2 wanted users to post from a computer , they can do so themselves			2
' i was initially inspired to create the app because i saw a sincerely lacking feature for the desktop , ' @entity5 said			2
' i know @entity2 purposely left out the uploading feature from the web interface to keep the social network ’s unique , mobile - centered ecosystem intact			2
@entity2 did release a web version of its software , called ' @entity116 on the @entity117 ' in february 2013			2
this allowed users to comment on each other 's photos from a desktop , but the photo sharing site still does not allow uploaded of images from a pc			0
to combat the problem , some @entity2 fans have installed special software , such as @entity129 , designed to simulate a mobile phone operating system on their computer			2
uploader for @entity2 offers a simpler workaround , and it is already garnering positive reviews on the app store			1
one user wrote : ' for my job , we post eight to ten @entity2 pictures a week that are first designed on the computer			0
' so it 's always been a bit of a nuisance to transfer the image over to my phone then upload to @entity2			0
this app takes care of that			0
' @entity2 , which @entity29 acquired in 2012 for $ 1 billion , has 300 million monthly users			1
a spokesperson for @entity2 declined to comment to @entity40 about the developments			0
@entity5 told @entity40 : ' i ’ve played a few of my last cards , and now i ’m just going to wait for @entity29 to play theirs			1
' i have no idea how this entire ordeal is going to end , but at least i know that i helped make a handful of people ’s lives easier – and i think that that is worth all of the trouble			0
