published : 04:39 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 05:14 est , 11 september 2012 an international consortium of more than 8,000 scientists have called for urgent help to save @entity4 's 100 most threatened animals , plants and fungi			1
while @entity10 has always operated by survival of the fittest , humanity 's increasing need for space is adding to the stresses on the natural kingdom			0
the report blamed a loss of habitat , caused by a rising human population and other factors such as expanding cities , deforestation , pollution and climate change , for driving more and more species of animals and plants to extinction			1
the 100 species , from 48 different countries are first in line to disappear completely if nothing is done to protect them			1
clinging to the edge : @entity34 ( left ) , otherwise known as @entity36 's guinea pig , is only found on the small island of @entity38 do @entity39 - which is only 26acres in size			1
meanwhile , there are just 170 of these albatrosses - @entity44 amsterdamensis - on their breeding spot of @entity46 in the southern @entity47 @entity48 nigriceps : hunted for food or sport , there are less than 250 left in @entity52 - and these are isolated in small groups across a wide area they range from the @entity58 rock iguana - originally reported extinct , but now found to be clinging on with two small populations , to the suicide palm of @entity61 , which dies exhausted after producing tiny yellow flowers on a stem up to 5 metres ( 16 ft ) long			1
many on the list , such as the @entity67 's liben lark , or the @entity69 sheath - tailed bat , may not be as familiar to us as lions or whales , but each adds something to the planet which , once lost , is gone forever			1
the report , ' priceless or @entity76 ? ' , says all the species need to be much better protected or face extinction by 2020			1
in the @entity82 , a small area in @entity81 is the only place in the world where the brightly coloured willow blister ( @entity87 maximus ) is found			1
populations of the spore - shooting fungi are currently in decline , and a single catastrophic event could cause their total destruction			1
@entity87 maximus occurs only on willows , as a weak parasite of twigs			0
in this highly specialised habitat , @entity87 maximus does not seriously threaten the tree			0
it produces extensive irregular black crusts below the bark , characteristically surrounded by a bright orange or yellow halo			0
when ripe and moist , the fruit body expands , breaking through the bark , and splitting the crust to reveal the fertile layer			0
@entity107 ( sexually produced microscopic fungal spores ) are released violently from this surface and are dispersed by the wind			0
only four sites , on the @entity112 of @entity81 , are known			1
the 124 - page report will be presented at the @entity114 in @entity115 this week , and hopes to push the conservation of ' worthless ' creatures up the agenda that is set by @entity119 from around the globe			1
professor @entity121 , director of conservation at @entity123 , said : ' over half ( of the 100 most endangered species ) are receiving little or no attention			2
' the donor community and conservation movement are leaning increasingly towards a ' what can nature do for us ' approach , where species and wild habitats are valued and prioritised according to the services they provide for people			2
' this has made it increasingly difficult for conservationists to protect the most threatened species on the planet			2
' while the utilitarian value of nature is important conservation goes beyond this			0
do these species have a right to survive or do we have a right to drive them to extinction ? ' co-author of the report , @entity123 's @entity153 says : ' all the species listed are unique and irreplaceable			1
' if they vanish , no amount of money can bring them back			0
however , if we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival			0
' but this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist			2
' the @entity114 said the report ' hopes to push the conservation of ' worthless ' creatures up the agenda that is set by @entity119 ( non-governmental organisations ) from around the globe			1
' ' we need a fund to prevent extinction , resourced by governments , that is in the billions , not millions , ' the report said , without specifying a currency			1
measures such as an expansion of protected areas or hunting bans were particularly needed , it said			0
@entity187 : in 2000 , there were believed to be just 50 of these birds left in the wilds of @entity191			1
this increased to 250 - until a theme park was built in the region , decimating the population again @entity196 has lost 97 per cent of its habitat , thanks to building work in @entity201 of @entity52 @entity121 said people may have gone too far in recent years in judging animals and plants by the economic value of the services they provide , including food , medicine or as tourist attractions			2
' we need to keep the appreciation for the wonderful diversity of life on @entity4 as the key message , and then other utilitarian arguments have to be additional , ' he said			0
governments agreed in 2010 to a plan to protect life on earth that included the goal : ' by 2020 the extinction of known threatened species has been prevented and their conservation status , particularly of those most in decline , has been improved and sustained			1
' the @entity114 said that all species had value			2
' although the value of some species may not appear obvious at first , all species in fact contribute in their way to the healthy functioning of the planet , ' said @entity237 , chair of the @entity238			2
the list of the 100 most endangered species included others such as the @entity243 ghost orchid , and the @entity245 rhino			2
a ban on hunting had helped the recovery of the humpback whale , now estimated to number 60,000			0
captive breeding meant that @entity252 's horse , once almost extinct , now numbered more than 300 in the wild from @entity254 to @entity255			0
the pygmy three - toed sloth ( @entity259 pygmaeus ) is one of the animals facing a bleak future			2
@entity263 , 17km off the coast of @entity265 , is the only place in the world where these tiny sloths are found			0
at half the size of their mainland cousins , and weighing roughly the same as a newborn baby , pygmy sloths are the smallest and slowest sloths in the world and remain @entity277			0
similarly , the saola ( @entity278 ) is one of the most threatened mammals in @entity281			0
known as the @entity285 unicorn because of its rarity , the population of these antelope may be down to few tens of individuals today			0
in the @entity82 , a small area in @entity81 is the only place in the world where the brightly coloured willow blister ( @entity87 maximus ) is found			1
populations of the spore - shooting fungi are currently in decline , and a single catastrophic event could cause their total destruction			0
professor @entity121 said : ' if we believe these species are priceless it is time for the conservation community , government and industry to step up to the plate and show future generations that we value all life			0
'' whilst monetising nature remains a worthwhile necessity for conservationists , the wider value of species on the brink of extinction should not be disregarded , the report states .			1

from a fungus in @entity81 to a guinea pig which lives only in a small *20acre* patch in @entity191 : plea goes out to save the *unknown* ' at - risks ' from extinction
report by international consortium calls for all species to be saved ' even if worthless by monetary standards '
