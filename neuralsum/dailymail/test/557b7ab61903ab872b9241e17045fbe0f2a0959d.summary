former @entity11 star @entity0 's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the @entity3 bench in contrast to the dejection of his one - time @entity17 boss @entity8			1

instead , @entity0 lobbed keeper @entity28 - as the @entity78 defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal			1
@entity8 had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with @entity84 and @entity85 coming up in the next few weeks			2
that looked to be the case until @entity0 's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams			0
@entity3 made the perfect start with @entity56 ' deflected free - kick after @entity29 took down @entity59 on the edge of the area			1

it was so one - sided manager @entity8 was poised to bring on @entity38 to shore up his midfield			0
instead , youngster @entity34 , who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier , learned his lesson			0
his flashing centre from the left picked out @entity40 inside the six - yard box and the on - loan @entity120 striker , back in the side after missing the @entity124 trip to @entity125 , finished with ease			0
@entity34 continued to prove a threat to the visitors ' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on @entity57			0

@entity3 striker @entity60 heads towards goal during the clash at the @entity143 the second half was much more competitive and wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors			1
so much so that @entity8 brought on @entity58 after 57 minutes for @entity57			0
and @entity58 made an immediate impact , bringing out a save from @entity28 before @entity31 cleared off the line from first - half scorer @entity56			0
however , @entity7 had their moments going forward too with @entity40 trying cheekily to chip @entity48 while @entity54 cleared off the line after @entity30 narrowly failed to connect with @entity34 's corner			2
@entity8 's intention 's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with @entity0 replacing @entity59 and @entity49 going off for @entity158			1
the visitors were incensed they did not get a penalty when @entity51 's cross hit @entity32 on the hand			0
