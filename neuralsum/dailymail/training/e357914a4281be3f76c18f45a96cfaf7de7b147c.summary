@entity0 set himself up for another miraculous @entity2 triumph by shooting an opening round of 69 to fire himself into contention at @entity5			1
despite playing in just his second tournament since undergoing major back surgery in march – he missed the cut on his return two weeks ago – woods insisted earlier this week that the only acceptable result for him at @entity13 would be victory			1
that looked like nothing more than hubris on thursday morning after the 14 - time @entity2 champion got off to a dreadful start at the venue where he won his last @entity5 in 2006 , bogeying both of the opening par fours amid some shoddy ball - striking			1
on the prowl : @entity0 looked in good form in his first round of @entity5 at @entity13 in the sand : @entity0 plays a shot from a greenside bunker on the final hole of his first round at @entity13 @entity32 @entity5 : first @entity34 highlights but @entity0 was not fazed and appeared more visibly relaxed on the course than at any time in recent memory			1
the former world no 1 was even spotted smiling at the galleries at times , causing gasps of shock among seasoned tiger - watchers used to his usual cold exterior			1
woods rallied with his first birdie of the day on the long fifth to head out in 36 strokes			2
as @entity50 , @entity51 and the game ’s young guns raced into the lead , @entity0 ’s score looked well short of what was required to challenge this week , but he stayed patient and hit a stunning patch of form on the back nine			2
three birdies in a row came from the 11th to the 13th holes			2
then , despite a dropped shot at the 14th , @entity0 rallied to birdie both the next two holes			1
on the par - five 15th he eased any fears over the state of his back by whipping through a full - blooded three - wood from the fairway			1
although his ball missed short right of the green , his gossamer touch from the rough earned a brilliant birdie			0
only a lip - out prevented another stroke gained on the 17th			2
reading the line : @entity0 prepares to putt on the ninth hole as a gallery looks on during the first round another explosive three - wood on the long final hole found a bunker protecting the front of the green but he set up a chance to seal a back nine of 32 strokes with an act of escapology			1
the putt slid agonisingly wide of its target , however			0
he said afterwards : ' i did n't exactly get off to the best of starts but i turned it around			0
' i felt like someone could shoot 63 out there but the wind is picking up			0
the ball was dancing round all over the place out there			2
' ' i knew i could do it			0
that 's why it was so important for me to play @entity108			0
i 'm only going to get better			0
' i felt fine , my warm - up was good			0
it was good being out there competing again			0
' frustration : @entity0 looks dejected after wasting a birdie opportunity on the 17th hole at @entity114 there are still three rounds left for @entity0 to complete but were the @entity118 superstar to win at @entity13 it would rank among his most stunning victories – of which there are plenty to choose @entity123 has not tasted victory in one of golf ’s big four tournaments since 2008 , when he won the @entity129 despite playing through the intense pain of stress fractures in his left leg and a torn cruciate knee ligament			1
the pressure on him to break @entity136 ’s record of 18 major titles is building after a six - year drought , and @entity0 is two shots behind the early pace set by @entity141 , who held the clubhouse lead at five under par when @entity0 ended his round			1
but the rest of the field will be all too aware that the big beast is back on the prowl			0

@entity118 is playing in just his second tournament since undergoing major back surgery in march
before the tournament he said anything but a win would be ' *unacceptable* '
the 14 - time @entity2 champion started poorly , bogeying his first two holes
but he rallied to finish his first round at @entity13 at three under par
