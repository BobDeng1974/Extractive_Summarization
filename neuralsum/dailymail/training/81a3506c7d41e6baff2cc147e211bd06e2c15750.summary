by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 5 june 2014 updated : 02:31 est , 9 june 2014 a @entity2 oil rig worker , who claimed to have seen ' @entity4 on fire ' over the @entity6 , revealed today that he had lost his job for reporting the incident			1
speaking for the first time about the sighting of a ' burning aircraft ' and the loss of his job , @entity10 remained positive about the contents of an email he had sent , in which he said : ' i believe i saw the @entity22 plane come down			1
' and he said that the ongoing search for the missing airliner raised many unanswered questions , adding : ' the investigators do not inspire trust			0
this comes as families of missing passengers have offered a $ us5 million reward for information leading to a breakthrough in the mystery			0
@entity51 woman @entity50 , the wife of missing @entity52 , said that contradictory information about the plane 's disappearance has prompted families to mount their own effort to find answers			1
the @entity4 campaign , to be financed via fundraising website @entity61 , aims to raise at least $ us5 million ( $ a5.41 million ) ' to encourage a whistleblower to come forward with information '			0
' we have been cut off so many times at the gate that we 're just now having to take things into our own hands , think outside the box and just try and do something to find this plane , ' mrs weeks told @entity73			2
the @entity74 said on thursday independent research confirmed searchers were looking in the right place for the plane the latest information and analysis confirms that @entity4 will be found in close proximity to the arc set out in this map and labelled as the 7th arc			2
at the time @entity4 reached this arc , the aircraft is considered to have exhausted its fuel and to have been descending			0
as a result , the aircraft is unlikely to be more than 20 @entity90 ( 38 km ) to the west or 30 @entity90 ( 55 km ) to the east of the arc			0
mr @entity10 sent an email to his employers , which in turn was leaked to the media who gained access to his name , place of work , the rig operator , @entity106 , as well as @entity10 's contractor and rig owner @entity103			1
the email address was inundated with so many inquiries that the operators ' communications became blocked			2
' this became intolerable for them and i was removed from the rig and not invited back , ' he told @entity2 's @entity116			2
the 7th arc : the seventh arc on this globe is the area where @entity4 is thought to be			0
the arc was determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between @entity4 and an @entity125 satellite he said that although he was paid up until the end of his work period , he was released from the rig five days earlier			1
mr @entity10 , a drilling fluids consultant who has worked mostly in @entity131 for the past 35 years - the last six almost continuously in @entity40 waters - is now looking for more work			1
in his email , mr @entity10 gave what appeared to be credible details of a burning plane			1
he described his exact location on the oil rig , the compass bearing of where the aircraft was in relation to the rig , the approximate distance of the plane from the rig , the current on the water surface and the wind direction			1
false hope : search teams have given up listening to pings detected by this machine as it 's now been confirmed they did not come from missing @entity34 's black box this diagram shows where the pings were detected , around 1,500 miles north west of @entity51 , in western @entity160			0
they lead to the search area being defined to a smaller space around them , but they have now been discounted from the investigation new method : the @entity169 navy then used the @entity170 ( pictured being hoisted on board @entity171 ) to map the ocean floor			0
the autonomous vehicle was managed by the @entity175 ( right ) the plane , he said in the email , was not on the normal flight path scheduled jets flying from @entity181 to @entity182 took - a fact he knew because ' we see the contrails every day			1
' he signed off his email with a ' good luck ' , followed by his full name and @entity2 passport number			2
after reading the email , @entity40 authorities interviewed the @entity194 and started an initial search - but two days after speaking to him the search in the @entity6 was called off when the hunt for @entity4 switched to the @entity199 and then to the southern part of the @entity201			1
back in march the @entity202 ( @entity202 ) was searching this relatively small area for @entity4			2
this handout satellite image shows a map of the planned search area on march 24 , 2014 since then , he said , neither the @entity208 nor @entity209 search teams had contacted him			2
just last week , @entity212 yachtswoman @entity211 , 41 , reported seeing an airliner on fire on the same night as mr @entity10 's ' burning plane ' - but she was in a totally different area , sailing east from southern @entity217 to @entity218 in southern @entity219			1
she told of seeing a plane surrounded by bright orange lights , leaving a trail of smoke as it pased above her			2
mr @entity10 told the @entity2 paper that his sighting placed the aircraft around 2000kms ( 1200 miles ) from the location of ms tee			1
he said he was unsure if @entity4 could have flown that far , asking : ' how far can a burning aeroplane fly ? ' a @entity2 author , @entity230 , has released his thriller e-book ' @entity4 ' just three months after the plane disappeared @entity50 , the wife of missing @entity52 , is disgusted at the release of the book mr weeks with his two young sons @entity237 , 3 , ( left ) and @entity238 , 11 months ( right ) in @entity2 , author @entity230 has released his thriller e-book ' @entity4 ' just three months after the plane disappeared			1
however @entity50 , the wife of missing @entity52 , told stuff.co.nz that she was disgusted at the release of the book			0
the @entity51 wife of mr weeks , who have two young sons together , found out by a text message from @entity22 that her husband had likely been killed when the plane crashed in the @entity201			1
meanwhile , the @entity74 sparked renewed hope in the search for @entity4 , saying a study completed after the 2009 @entity252 crash concluded that the majority of aircraft in loss - of - control accidents were found within 32km of their last known position			0
' this provides a reasonable limitation for the size of the search area across the arc			0
' the satellite data indicates the @entity263 flew for six hours after falling off radar screens			0
a new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will begin in august , with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released , according to @entity269			0
meanwhile , a @entity271 vessel is currently conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed			0
recently , there have been many claims of knowledge about the whereabouts of the missing @entity22 flight			1
@entity284 in @entity160 released information that an underwater sound recorded just 10 minutes after the plane lost contact with air traffic control could have been the plane crashing into the water			1
however , dr @entity292 from the @entity284 said there is only a 10 percent chance the ' dull oomph ' was actually @entity4			0
and a @entity212 sailor reported she spotted what she believed to be a plane on fire with black smoke trailing behind it while on a 13 month expedition with her husband			1
@entity211 said she did n't say anything at the time as she was the only one who spotted it and did n't realise it 's potential relevance			0
relatives of the 239 passengers and crew were recently successful in demanding @entity125 publicly release its data , after losing faith that searchers were looking in the right area			0
the search for the missing plane continues , with @entity271 vessels mapping the sea floor in preparation for the next step of the search			0

@entity10 was working on the @entity38 oil rig off the coast of @entity40 on march 8 when he saw what he believed was a ' burning plane '
mr @entity10 sent an email claiming : ' i believe i saw the @entity22 plane come down . the timing is right '
the email was leaked to the media and mr @entity10 was paid up until the end of his work period but released from the rig five days earlier
the drilling consultant for the past 35 years is now looking for more work
