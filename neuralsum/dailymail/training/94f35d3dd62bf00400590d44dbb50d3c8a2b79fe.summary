however , when he arrived , @entity38 was too big to fit in the 10 - foot - deep den and a smaller volunteer was needed to slip inside			2
five pups - three males and two females - had been living on their own for two days , while sadly , another one had died prior to their rescue			2
all the pups had porcupine quills sticking out of them and the first thing the rescuers did was give them sugar water through a pipette to hydrate them			2

it was just like holding a puppy , they ’re so young they do n’t know any better			0
