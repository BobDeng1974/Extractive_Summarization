when @entity2 fans bemoaned last season ’s title collapse , they did so with the heavy burden of recent history on their shoulders			1
they will have seen their captain , @entity8 , fight for the championship in those closing weeks as if it were his last shot at the only domestic glory which has eluded him			0
and when it slipped from his grasp in those final few games , they will have feared a repeat of what followed on the last two occasions @entity2 finished second in the league			1
despite losing manager @entity43 ’s services for several months due to the @entity45 ’s heart surgery , it had all looked so promising			0
the @entity46 rallied in the last three months of the campaign , minus striker @entity48 , who had been sold to @entity49 in the november			1
but during that summer , @entity43 turned down the opportunity to sign enigmatic compatriot @entity53 , instead buying the wholly ineffective @entity55 @entity54			2
what followed was abject misery			0
instead of pushing on and challenging for the number one spot , form deserted the @entity61 side and their disappointing fifth - place finish even killed off the consolation of @entity66 qualification			2
to make matters worse , @entity2 crawled home a massive 19 points behind @entity40 - a 22 - point swing in fortunes between the rivals from either end of the @entity74			1
@entity43 oversaw a drop from second in 2001 - 02 to fifth in 2002 - 03 when he was @entity2 boss it would be another six years before @entity2 again stove for the dizzy heights of the @entity31 summit			1
the 2008 - 09 campaign was widely considered the best under @entity82 manager @entity81 , even though he had clinched @entity66 glory with that famous fightback in @entity85 in 2005			1
@entity2 finished with a club - record @entity31 haul of 86 points			1
they may have trailed sir @entity89 and @entity40 by four points in the final reckoning , but @entity2 had been top in april and @entity61 was again filled with promise for the season ahead			1
the implosion , however , was spectacular			0
just 12 months later , a team which had threatened so much under @entity81 was languishing seventh in the table			1
@entity81 saw an even greater slump after his @entity2 team came in seventh after a runners - up finish @entity2 finished second in 2008 - 09 but languished in seventh in 2010 it was their lowest finish in 11 years and @entity2 could not crawl beyond the fourth round of either domestic competition			1
and after working so hard the season before to qualify to be among @entity107 ’s elite , they did not even progress to the knock - out stage of the @entity66			1
at the end of that season , the club announced they had terminated @entity81 ’s contract and so began the farce that was @entity114 ’s doomed reign			2
in the decade before @entity114 strolled through the door at @entity61 , there had been moments of majesty			0
the @entity66 victory in 2005 , in particular , brought back memories of @entity2 ’s glorious past			2
but , something was missing ; there was no league title			0
and for a club built on their dominance of the domestic scene , it was a bitter pill to swallow			0
the pain looks likely to continue			0
@entity2 have struggled for creativity since the departure of last season 's 31 - goal top scorer @entity132 @entity2 finished second last season but have started poorly this time round , stuck in 11th many predicted trouble for @entity2 after @entity132 , last season ’s 31 - goal top scorer , wiped away his tears , packed his bags and strode off into the sunset for a new life at @entity142			1
perhaps , though , nobody expected it to be quite this bad			0
after finishing just two points away from winning the league last season , @entity2 have won just two of their opening five matches			2
and the drama of tuesday night ’s record - breaking penalty shootout success over @entity21 will fool nobody			2
@entity32 ’ side were pushed to exhaustion by a @entity156 outfit			0
in the modern age , whenever a club fails to secure success expected of them , then finance - or lack of it - is usually thrown up as the excuse			0
@entity2 detest comparisons with @entity40 , but the @entity167 outfit are often the perfect example			2
big summer signings @entity170 ( left ) , @entity171 ( centre ) and @entity173 are yet to shine while @entity2 ’s title challenges only ever seemed to last one season , @entity40 have come close one year only to then to march to the title the following season			1
@entity40 finished second in 1995 , 1998 , 2006 , 2010 and 2012 but lifted the @entity31 trophy each following may			1
the key to @entity40 ’s resurgence has been their willingness to invest and reinvent each time they have looked like losing their way			0
failure has been the breeding ground for subsequent success			0
nobody can accuse @entity32 of refusing to spend in the wake of @entity132 ’s departure to @entity142 for £ 75m			2
@entity191 's @entity190 celebrates scoring the winning goal against @entity2 at @entity61 in september he splashed out more than £ 100m on nine players in the summer , but there has been a glaring absence of pay - back for that investment			1
@entity24 , @entity170 and @entity173 have all failed to shine while @entity2 have again struggled in defence and shown a glaring lack of creativity in front of goal			0
perhaps as well as the burden of history , @entity2 ’s players feel the weight of expectation			0
after 25 years without the title by the time this season ends , the clamour for success grows ever greater with each passing season			0
it was a millstone which similarly hung around @entity40 ’s throats until @entity89 smashed it to pieces in 1992			0
it was the arrival of @entity216 in the december of that season which eventually inspired @entity40 to run away with the title with an astonishing 10 - point margin			1
maybe when the transfer window reopens , @entity32 will have located the marquee signing to replace @entity132 and finally banish those @entity61 demons .			2

@entity2 have fallen away badly the two seasons after they finished runners - up in the @entity31
@entity43 's team finished fifth in 2002 - 03 , while @entity81 's men could only manage seventh in 2009 - 10
@entity32 will be keen to avoid a repeat after the @entity36 **narrowly** missed out on the @entity31 title last season
when @entity40 come second , the next season they win the league
the @entity46 , who sold star striker @entity132 in the summer , have struggled so far this season
they *'ve* lost three of five @entity31 games and only **narrowly** beat @entity21 in the @entity22 and @entity243 in @entity66
none of @entity2 's many summer signings have shone , while the *defensive* *fragility* of last season seems to have worsened
