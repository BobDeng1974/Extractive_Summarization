@entity1 , @entity0 played @entity2 and , more often than not , beat them			1
but that was before the @entity4 swept into @entity5 and altered the @entity7 landscape			1
instead of the fixture that @entity11 fans looked forward to the most , it has become the match they must secretly dread			2
it was another @entity5 – @entity14 – who landed the first blow on behalf of owner @entity16 and announced the arrival of a new order when he grabbed an 87th minute winner to clinch a 3 - 2 aggregate @entity21 win at @entity23 in march 2004			1
@entity24 scores against @entity0 for @entity2 at @entity23 in the @entity21 back in march 2004 the arrival of @entity26 and @entity16 marked an end to @entity0 's victories over @entity2 things have never been quite the same , since			1
and @entity24 ’s goal was the turning point			0
@entity33 supporters look away now , as a reminder of the good old days brings home how fortunes have changed in the @entity7 era			2
@entity38 , the teams have played 28 times			0
@entity0 have won just six matches in all competitions , drawn seven and lost 15			0
contrast and compare that with 1992 - 2003 , before the @entity46 billionaire turned @entity2 from fancy dans to title winners			1
the teams faced each other 22 times			0
@entity0 lost only three , won 12 and drew seven and were the undisputed kings of the capital			0
@entity0 players look dejected as @entity2 celebrate their 6 - 0 victory in march of this year it all looked so rosy , in february 2004 , when @entity57 ’s team knocked @entity2 out of the @entity58 and then beat them 2 - 1 at @entity5 in what was then known as the @entity7			1
@entity60 and @entity61 cancelled out @entity63 ’s early strike while the @entity64 was also sent off in the second half			0
one month later the rivals met in the @entity21			0
the first leg was drawn 1 - 1 and @entity0 were over-riding favourites			2
@entity69 gave the @entity11 the lead on half - time only for @entity71 to level the scores before @entity24 had the final say			2
@entity0 fans could argue that it was not in the @entity7 , which is what really counts over a season			1
the same could be applied to the @entity78 in 2005 when a @entity79 double ensured a 2 - 1 @entity2 win			2
@entity81 is mistakenly sent off following @entity83 's handball on the goal - line but later that august , @entity0 could no longer claim to be so superior as @entity79 scored the only goal in a 1 - 0 @entity7 home victory			1
the return was in december the same year			0
@entity88 and @entity89 both found the net at @entity23 and @entity2 had done the double over their @entity93 neighbours			0
as far as the neutral is concerned , however , this is a match which tends to throw up lots of goals , plenty of controversy and the enduring feud between @entity57 and @entity26			1
@entity0 fans will not need long memories to recall a rare fine moment – the 5 - 3 extravaganza in october 2011 when @entity103 scored twice in the last five minutes to complete his hat - trick after it looked as if @entity105 had clinched a 3 - 3 draw			2
then again , they will not want reminding about what happened last season			0
down to ten men ( even if @entity81 was sent off instead of @entity83 ) and on the end of a 6 - 0 thrashing			1
will the tide turn again on sunday ? the bookies suggest not .			0

@entity2 host @entity0 in the @entity7 on sunday
@entity57 has never beaten @entity26 as a *manager*
the @entity11 were crushed 6 - 0 at @entity5 last season
