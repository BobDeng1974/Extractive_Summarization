if you do n’t like fruit and veg but want to look after your heart , scientists may have come up with the answer			2
they have created a ‘ tomato pill ’ that is bursting with lycopene , the compound credited with many health benefits of the @entity12 diet			1
a single @entity14 pill contains as much lycopene – the pigment that gives tomatoes their rich , red colour – as more than 2lb of the fruit			1
breakthrough : a single @entity14 pill contains as much lycopene - the pigment that gives tomatoes their rich , red colour - as more than 2lb of the fruit now , @entity27 research has shown the supplement improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks and people with angina and other cardiac problems			1
in those who took the £ 1 - a - day pill once a day for two months , vital cells that line the inside of blood vessels became healthier			0
these endothelial cells are key to keeping blood moving through the body – and to warding off future heart attacks and strokes			1
in those who took the lycopene , blood vessels were able to open more than 50 per cent wider by the end of the study , improving blood flow			0
by the end of the study , the blood cell lining of the heart patients worked almost as well as that of healthy people			0
importantly , the improvement was seen despite the volunteers being on blood pressure pills , statins and other tablets designed to improve heart health , the journal @entity65 reports			2
no effect was seen on the blood vessels of people who were otherwise healthy			0
the pill , which can be bought on the high street and was created by scientists working for a @entity27 spin - out company , did n’t affect blood pressure or the flexibility of the arteries			2
the researchers on the blood vessel study , who are n’t connected to the manufacturer , said that despite the improvement seen , more longer - term studies are needed to show that taking @entity14 cuts the risk of heart attacks and strokes			1
study : @entity27 research has shown the supplement improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks and people with angina and other cardiac problems however , as lycopene is especially potent when mixed with olive oil , the finding could help explain by a @entity12 - style seems so good for health			1
researcher dr @entity102 , of @entity27 and the city ’s @entity103 , said : ‘ there 's a wealth of research that suggests that the @entity12 diet - which includes lycopene found in tomatoes and other fruit as a component - is good for our cardiovascular health			1
‘ but so far , it 's been a mystery what the underlying mechanisms could be			0
‘ we 've shown quite clearly that lycopene improves the function of blood vessels in cardiovascular disease patients			2
it reinforces the need for a healthy diet in people at risk from heart disease and stroke			0
‘ a daily ' tomato pill ' is not a substitute for other treatments , but may provide added benefits when taken alongside other medication			0
’ the @entity135 , which helped fund the study , said that more work was needed to see if the benefits seen lead to actual improvement to heart health			0
other research has credited lycopene with a host of health benefits from warding off prostate cancer to boosting sperm concentration .			1

single @entity14 pill contains as much lycopene as more than 2lb of fruit
pigment gives tomatoes their colour and is credited with many of the *mediterranean* diet health benefits
scientists say pill improves blood vessel health in survivors of heart attacks
