by @entity0 a local survey tells me people like penalty shoot - outs			1
on saturday evening , my wife @entity7 was on her way out of the house when she passed the lounge door			0
briefly in her eye - line the tv , and @entity16 v @entity11 reaching its climax with the first penalty shoot - out of this @entity19			1
she stopped momentarily to ‘ just watch the first penalty ’ , and was still there nine penalties later			0
and she was n’t alone as over 12 million people saw @entity26 poster - boy @entity25 score @entity16 ’s vital fifth penalty and @entity29 fall - guy @entity30 strike a post and send his team - mates back to the hotel for their passports			1
' there is conjecture about penalty shoot - outs but for me they are great to watch			2
' and i ’m with him on that			0
on the spot : @entity26 players celebrate after defeating @entity11 on penalties to progress to the quarter - finals @entity49 : @entity25 ( r ) gives @entity50 encouragement during @entity16 's @entity19 penalty shoot - out agony ! @entity11 's @entity30 hits the post with his penalty to hand the advantage to @entity16 saturday ’s penalty shoot - out was described in excellent fashion by the @entity60 commentary pairing of @entity61 and @entity62			1
it is one of the trickiest pieces of football commentary to get right			0
it is a time to be economical with your words , know exactly the consequence of every penalty scored or missed , know where you are in the penalty kick sequence , have readily at hand any particular telling piece of information about the incoming penalty - taker , implicitly understand each other ’s role and most importantly let the pictures do the talking			0
things have got a little easier down the years			0
the graphics supporting the shoot - outs are clearer for one and the match directors themselves have had more experience of covering them			0
that doyen of football commentators , the late great @entity89 reflected once with typical honesty on the ‘ hospital pass ’ he had sent his co-commentator @entity95 during the famous penalty shoot - out between @entity97 and @entity98 in @entity19 ’ 98			1
spoke too soon ! @entity95 wrongly predicted that @entity99 would score at the @entity100 @entity99 was next up and had to score to keep @entity97 ’s hopes alive			1
@entity89 knew @entity95 had managed him and wanted to know how @entity99 would handle it			2
a legitimate question but @entity99 shaped up to take the penalty more quickly than anticipated			0
as @entity99 stepped up to hit the ball , @entity89 said hurriedly ‘ @entity95 , you know him - yes or no , will he score			2
’ ‘ yes ’ was still coming out of @entity95 ’s mouth as @entity99 missed the vital kick			0
@entity61 , now firmly established as @entity60 ’s senior football commentator , had the right pace of delivery , @entity62 , the right snap analysis before and after every kick , and the pictures and remarkable atmosphere within the stadium did the rest			2
been there , done that ! @entity60 pundit @entity121 was able to reflect on his experiences from 2006 @entity19 with informed out - of - vision opinions from @entity125 and @entity126 , both @entity19 penalty shoot - out veterans , @entity121 ’s reflections on his own experiences and @entity130 freely admitting he would n’t have the courage to take one , it was a very solid piece of television sport			1
on @entity137 , the pronunciation of @entity135 sensation , @entity136 , seemed to create a little fun , @entity139 , with a flourish , gave it the ‘ @entity141 ’ , @entity142 , the straight - down - the middle @entity136			2
i expect they ’ll both agree on the pronunciation of @entity146 before @entity137 screen the @entity16 v @entity147 on friday ! lost in translation : the pronunciation of @entity136 's name caused some fun on @entity137			1

@entity153 of @entity154 reflects on @entity16 's penalty shoot out with @entity11
over *12m* people watched @entity25 send @entity16 through to quarter - finals
@entity61 and @entity62 gave a *measured* commentary for @entity60
@entity95 wrongly predicted @entity99 would score in 1998
@entity136 's name has been causing pronunciation *problems*
