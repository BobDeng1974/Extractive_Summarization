by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 10 january 2013 when you advertise for a nanny offering a princely $ 15 - an - hour , most parents are n't expecting @entity3 to waft through the door			1
however one @entity7 couple are setting the bar high after posting a @entity10 ad this week accompanied by 65 highly personal and detailed questions for the future caretaker of their children			1
the nanny ad was posted online on january 5 by a couple who live with their two sons in the @entity19 area of @entity20 , @entity7			1
dream job : a couple in @entity20 , @entity7 have advertised for a ' magical @entity3 ' - with a grueling , 65 - question survey about the potential employee 's drug and hygiene habits the couple demand full disclosure with an online @entity29 that covers everything from marijuana smoking to the use of hand sanitizer			1
the ad opens : ' grab your umbrella ! you are a magical @entity3 , a wizard , or a giant spiky @entity38			2
' you love to play , pretend , create , teach , and nurture			0
you are reliable , warm , and fun , but also know how to say " no " when necessary			0
' the job description requires the nanny to take care of two boys , aged two and five , two days a week , between the hours of 11.30am and 5.30pm			2
tasks include picking up the two children from school , preparing lunch , setting nap times , organizing games , activities and reading			0
the nanny may also be asked by the parents to work on an occasional ' date night ' , according to the @entity10 post			2
so far , so normal - but the slightly off - beat introduction gives no indication of the grilling to come			2
welcome to the neighborhood : the part - time nanny job is based in the @entity19 area of @entity20 , @entity7 the opening question of the survey asks : ' are you an @entity64 citizen ? ' followed up by : ' if your family is from outside @entity64 , do you see yourself becoming homesick and needing to return to them ? from there , the questions take an even more personal turn			1
' will you be able to provide a letter from your primary care doctor stating that you are in good health and able to perform the rigorous job of caring for two small children ? ' the couple ask			0
they add : ' will you provide a letter from your doctor listing all your current prescription drugs ? ' this segues into an inquiry over drug use that a narc squad officer would be proud of			0
question 25 reads : ' how often do you smoke weed ? ' the interrogation does n't end there - the follow - up question asking : ' if you ever smoke weed , how many smokes do you typically have on a social occasion ? ' the topic then branches out to ask potential nannies how often they use all recreational drugs ( with the helpful description of ' all drugs you ca n't buy at the supermarket ' )			0
a check - box list is then included which runs the gauntlet of legal and illegal substances from @entity103 and cough med to meth and heroin			0
help wanted : a couple with two young sons posted an ad looking for a nanny on @entity10 earlier this week the future employers also want to know if the prospective nanny has ever smoked cigarettes and whether he or she is prone to a hangover			1
hedonistic habits aside , personal hygiene is also a grave concern of this couple			0
the employee is asked a rigorous set of questions about how often they shower , when they wash their hands , their length of fingernails and whether they use perfume			0
and for $ 15 an hour , the couple inquires as to their prospective @entity3 ' high school and college @entity130 and whether they have an advanced degree			1
the parents finally state that the nanny is banned from using ' @entity135 or blogging ' anything about the family - in their public @entity10 ad .			1
