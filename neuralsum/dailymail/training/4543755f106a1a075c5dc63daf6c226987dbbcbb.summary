by @entity0 before we get to the nostalgia and respect that i have for my cousin ’s @entity6 career , can i just say what an embarrassment it is that no @entity6 manager got the best out of @entity13 and @entity14 playing together			1
add @entity15 - all three have been masters of their art at club level			0
with their talent , they should have won a @entity22 to supplement their honours for @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
or at least have made a major final			2
they have won 38 trophies for their clubs ( so far ) , none for their country			0
it was october 10 , 1999 when @entity13 first pulled on an @entity6 shirt in a team including @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , now my @entity53 colleague … and my cousin and i. it was the first time we had played together since family kick - arounds in @entity61 ’s back garden as schoolboys			1
it was a momentous occasion in my family ; our parents were at the @entity39 , although grandad could n’t make it up from the south coast in time			0
the team had only been named that morning and we did n’t expect to play together			2
@entity13 , a 21 - year - old uncapped @entity71 midfielder , was selected by @entity72 for his debut against @entity38 in @entity74 and i was there next to him			1
after the @entity77 and the @entity78 , the @entity76 became only the third father and son combination to play for @entity6			1
it was a big day for his mum and dad , @entity85 and @entity86 keeping it in the family : @entity53 's @entity0 ( right ) lined alongisde cousin @entity13 for @entity6 our elation was obvious , although there was a minute ’s silence before the game for 31 people who died in the @entity97 rail disaster five days earlier , when 520 people were also injured			1
the team wore black armbands and paid its respects before we set about beating @entity38 2 - 1			1
i thought we played ok			0
i scored a screamer ( with my left foot ) and , though @entity72 bizarrely later claimed to the press he ’d been angry with us , i do n’t recall that			0
he said : ‘ it was a great start and you think , “ @entity111 and play ” , but for the first time i had to get angry with a few players			2
the two i got into were @entity0 and @entity13			1
they responded really well so maybe i should get angry again			0
’ it meant we were back page news in the @entity117 for the wrong reasons ! @entity13 enjoyed a glorious international career , winning 106 caps			1
i have always been proud of him and i hope we will look back on that debut with pride in years to come			2
proud : @entity0 hopes @entity13 , who won 106 caps , looks back on his @entity6 debut with pride @entity125 announces @entity6 retirement @entity13 improved with age			1
he possessed wonderful drive and a hungry appetite			0
@entity85 was a huge influence on him and pushed him			0
his dad could be ferocious at times , but @entity13 handled that and improved			1
my dad tells stories of him running alone at @entity71 ’s training ground , where @entity61 and @entity13 were the management team , forcing himself to improve his stamina			2
it was that stamina , the timing of his runs , his finishing and his power that turned him into a @entity146 star			0
i look at him now , signing for @entity147 and refusing to accept the time has caught him up , and i admire his determination			0
he does n’t care what people think and do n’t be surprised if he makes a difference to @entity147 at some point before he heads for @entity154 and his next adventure			0
still going strong : @entity13 joined @entity147 this summer following his release from @entity24 he has enjoyed a momentous career			1
it ’s the right time for him to retire from international football			2
it is 5,435 days since we pulled on the red shirt of @entity6 together - 14 years , 10 months , and 17 days - but i remember it like it was on tuesday			1
i was proud to be there at the start and to be writing this tribute at the end			0
106 caps – equal sixth with @entity172 and behind @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity14 , @entity175 and @entity176 – with 89 starts 14 years and 257 days as an @entity6 player 13 @entity180 qualifier goals 40 @entity180 shots without a goal ( although that goal should have counted against @entity184 in 2010 )			2
3 goals in four games at @entity187 , his only euros			0
1999 debut against @entity38 in october friendly aged 21 years , 111 days 9 penalties converted from 11			1
191 tackles won out of 261 62 games won 5 yellow cards but no reds			0
29 goals - the ninth most			0

@entity0 believes @entity6 failed to get the best out of @entity13
