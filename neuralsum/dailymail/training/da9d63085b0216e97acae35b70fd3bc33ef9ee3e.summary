by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 11:41 est , 27 january 2014 a heartbroken couple are preparing to say their final goodbyes to their dying five - year - old son - three years after losing their daughter			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , from @entity11 , are living a nightmare that most parents could n’t begin to imagine - knowing that shortly they will lose a second child to a cruel degenerative condition			1
@entity16 is dying of mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome , the same condition that killed his sister , @entity19 , in 2010 when she was just three			1
@entity9 and @entity10 had two children both with devastating mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome			1
their daughter , @entity19 , died in 2010 at the age of three and their son , @entity16 , five , is also dying ms @entity9 , 27 , said : ‘ i will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that really hurts			1
’ but she added : ‘ i may not have had them for long but they are a blessing			0
’ @entity16 began to be gradually robbed of the ability to move before he could even crawl or say his first words			2
he is unable to move anything other than his eyes and is currently being given palliative care at home			2
his parents know that they will probably eventually have to make the traumatic decision to turn off his life support machine – just as they did with his sister			0
ms @entity9 said : ‘ it ’s hard seeing other parents with their children , going shopping and seeing children hold their mum ’s hand and say “ mummy ”			1
@entity19 appeared to be a healthy baby when she was first born but by the time she was six months old her parents had started to notice that she was becoming weak @entity16 's parents are caring for him at home but they know he will probably have to go into a hospice ‘ i ’ve been a mum to two children and yet never heard them say “ mum ”			1
‘ i will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that hurts			0
’ the syndrome is an inherited disease which starts to show symptoms in infancy			0
most patients are born after a normal pregnancy and appear healthy at birth			0
symptoms usually begin to appear in the first few months of life			0
it causes progressive muscle weakness , decreased muscle tone and kidney problems			1
it also causes patients to lose motor skills such as standing , walking , eating and talking			0
eventually the muscles that control breathing become weak and respiratory failure is the most common cause of death			0
intelligence is not usually affected			0
children with severe forms of the condition usually survive for less than a year			1
it is not yet fully understood what causes the condition but both parents of the child have to carry the gene mutation			0
it is recessive meaning a child has a 25 per cent chance of suffering from the disease if both their parents carry the mutation			0
there were no signs of problems when @entity19 was born in 2006 , but when she was six months old her parents noticed she was getting weaker			2
their world came crashing down when she was rushed to hospital gasping for breath one night having suddenly deteriorated			0
@entity19 struggled to get enough oxygen and she was taken to @entity108 where she was ventilated			2
she had a tracheotomy , and spent 10 months on the high dependency ward where she was finally diagnosed with mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome			1
the condition results in neurological symptoms that start to appear in infancy and is characterised by generalised muscle weakness			1
as the disorder worsens , the muscles which control breathing are weakened and ventilator support is needed			0
ms @entity9 soon discovered she was pregnant with their second child and @entity19 was in intensive care by the time her little brother was born			1
the couple prayed @entity16 would escape the rare genetic disorder - and were told there was a 75 per cent chance he would			2
but their world was shattered for a second time when he too suffered developmental delays and was finally diagnosed with the same condition at seven months old			0
‘ we were n’t only unlucky once , but twice , ’ ms @entity9 said			2
ms @entity9 , 27 , said : ' i will never see them grow up like other parents see their children grow older and that really hurts ' just after his first birthday , @entity16 was also admitted to @entity108 and he and his sister were in cubicles next to each other some of the time			1
but after a bad bout of the respiratory infection bronchiolitis , @entity19 was taken to @entity144 in @entity145 where she passed away in july 2010			2
her parents found @entity144 to be a ‘ magical ’ place , nothing like what they expected it to be			0
they were so impressed by the care @entity19 received they vowed it would be where they switched off @entity16 ’s life support machine when the time came			1
the couple are raising money for the children ’s hospice where @entity16 will probably spend his last hours .			2

@entity9 and @entity10 had two children with *devestating* mitochondrial dna depletion syndrome - @entity19 and @entity16
@entity19 died in 2010 at the age of three and @entity16 , five , is also dying
the condition causes muscle weakness which becomes so severe patients are unable to breathe *unaided*
