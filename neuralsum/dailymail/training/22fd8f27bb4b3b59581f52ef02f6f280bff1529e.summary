by @entity0 his father and his sister both died young because they were morbidly obese			1
and at 52st , @entity6 , 38 , from @entity7 , @entity5 seemed certain to follow in their footsteps			1
he was unable to exercise and subsisted on a diet of fatty takeaways			0
but a warning from his doctor that he would not live to 65 , the age his father died , was the jolt that @entity6 needed to lose the weight he needed to be eligible for bypass surgery			1
by the time he was 16 years old he already weighed 280lbs ( 20st )			0
when he left college he went to work as a mechanic but his growing addiction to fast food only served to increase his size			0
he moved to work to a desk - bound job in an accountancy firm but found that he found that he used food to unwind from listening to people 's problems all day			1
' most people when they get off work want to go grab a beer , ' he said			0
' i just want to eat			0
' @entity6 visits the cemetery where his father and sister are both buried however as his weight increased , his health deteriorated			1
' i feel like i ’m trapped , like i ’m useless , ' he said			0
my knees are just aching			0
i try not to move too much			0
i get out of breath , like i ’m going to pass out			0
' the programme shows @entity6 picking up a large amount of fast food on the drive home from work , and then eating another meal at home			1
his mother @entity21 cooks for him , and said tearfully : ' i guess @entity6 blames me for his weight			1
but i cooked how i knew how to cook			0
i hope he ’s not too bitter at me			0
' she added : ' it 's not really his fault that he ’s overweight – it ’s our family history			2
his dad died and then his sister six months later			2
him and her were like twins			0
' eerily , @entity6 's sister moved into the bed that her father slept in after he died , and then @entity6 moved in once his sister died			1
asked his mother fearfully : ‘ is he the next in line ? ’ @entity6 and his mother @entity21 wait to see if he is eligible for weight - loss surgery weighing in at 728lbs , @entity6 is told by surgeon dr @entity72 that he is unlikely to make it to the age of 65 , the age his father died , but that he is too heavy for weight - loss surgery			1
however after losing 53lbs in a couple of weeks due to a diet consisting mainly of eggs and toast , he sheds the required weight and has a stomach bypass operation			2
said @entity6 : ' i know i ’ve been hiding behind my weight for too long			1
it ’s killing me – i know it ’s time to change			0

' within five months @entity6 had lost 148llbs and started dating @entity98 , a woman he met online and who herself had had weight - loss surgery , previously weighing 350lbs			1
however the weight - loss slowed down as @entity6 gave into his cravings for fast food			1
the pair are now house - hunting and talking about marriage and spending the rest of their lives together but a visit to his father and sister 's graves at the local cemetery reignited his determination			1
after more surgery to remove his excess skin - which alone weighed a whopping 76lbs - he is back on track , playing golf , joining the local gym - and even doing acqua - aerobics			2
a year on and @entity6 and @entity98 are house - hunting			1
@entity6 now weighs just 376lbs , having lost 352lbs , nearly half his body weight			1
' i 'm excited about the future , ' says @entity6			2
' i 'm in love with @entity98 and we 're talking about getting married			0
i feel there 's a whole new world out there			2
