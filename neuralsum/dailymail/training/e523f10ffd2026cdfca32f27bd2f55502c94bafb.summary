by @entity0 @entity2 's squad contains players from almost all corners of the globe , but it has n't taken long for some of their key players to adapt to their @entity9 surroundings			2
the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 have been fairly new arrivals in the last few years , but they appear to have picked up a rather peculiar @entity9 accent at the club 's new kit launch			2
along with @entity33 the duo appear to have either developed an incredible knack of impersonating accents or there 's been some dubbing work done in @entity2 's media department			0
either way , it 's hilarious to listen to and it would be incredibly disappointing not to hear any of them maintain the regional touch to any interviews over the next season			0
more worryingly for @entity2 fans though is what has happened to @entity47 , with the club 's striker seemingly having undergone reverse puberty and gain the vocal chords of a child			1
three is the magic number : @entity2 have released three new kits for the upcoming season new era : @entity57 have taken over supplying @entity2 's kit after @entity59 ended their association with the @entity61 after 20 years @entity2 launch new kit on the @entity18 as long as the @entity64 hitman continues to fire in the goals , @entity2 fans wo n't care too much , but which accent will new Â£ 30m signing @entity67 adopt ? @entity2 legends also get in on the act , with @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 featuring as the voices for @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 respectively			1
there could be an answer as to where the @entity9 lessons have come from , though			0
actor @entity81 is a prime suspect but former midfielder @entity82 has taught @entity83 a few rhyming slang words in the past			0
@entity2 's players having a voice identity crisis coincides with the release of three new @entity61 strips ahead of the new season by new kit suppliers @entity57 , who have taken over from @entity59 .			1

@entity2 trio adopt *cockney* *twang* for new @entity57 kit launch
@entity47 given child 's voice *promoting* *cup* kit release for *2014/15*
@entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 also given voices of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72
