by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:26 est , 25 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:40 est , 26 december 2013 small businesses could find it easier to borrow money under a shake - up of bank lending rules unveiled today			1
at present , many firms find it difficult to persuade the big four banks to lend them cash to enable them to expand their operations – hampering the growth of the economy			1
strict rules mean it is harder for smaller ‘ challenger ’ banks to be able to lend firms money because they do not have access to the credit worthiness ratings of potential borrowers			1
the @entity25 will propose that the big four banks - @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 ( pictured ) and @entity29 - should be forced to share credit worthiness ratings with other smaller lenders the @entity25 will today propose that the big four banks – @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 – should be forced to share these ratings with other lenders , making it easier for small banks to provide businesses with the cash they need			1
@entity39 , the financial secretary to the treasury , said : ‘ the government is determined to build a banking system that supports @entity44 ’s economy and its small and medium sized businesses			2
‘ the best way to deliver this is to increase competition in the sector and remove the barriers to new sources of finance for @entity53 [ small and medium enterprises ]			0
requiring banks to share data is an important part of creating a more level playing field that will enable more providers to enter the market			1
’ the @entity60 launched its @entity62 campaign three years ago after it emerged they were starving small firms of funds , choking off the recovery			2
but last month @entity44 ’s two state - backed banks – @entity28 and @entity29 – were accused of ruining thousands of small firms by using ‘ unscrupulous ’ business practices			1
in a trap : at the moment , small business struggle to persuade the big four banks to lend them cash to enable them to expand their operations , which in turn hampers the economy an independent report commissioned by the government found that @entity29 had acted like a ‘ hit squad ’ by deliberately causing healthy businesses to go bust for its own gain			1
in the worst cases , the bank withdrew lines of credit for previously solvent firms by charging high fees and charges so it could then seize their assets at knock - down prices			0
the new shake - up is an attempt to stamp down on such abuse			0
ministers will today pledge to set up a consultation on new rules for sharing the credit data of small and medium enterprises			0
if these draft proposals are implemented , it will be easier for challenger banks and alternative finance providers to enter the market and provide credit to @entity53			1
banks will be required to share small firms ’ credit data through credit reference agencies			1
several bodies , including the @entity113 and the @entity114 , have all highlighted how a lack of information about the creditworthiness of small businesses has limited the number of providers of @entity53 finance			0
as a result the big four high street banks control 85 per cent of @entity53 lending			0
improved access to this credit data , through greater competition and innovation in @entity53 lending , should improve the cost and quality of services offered			0
small firms are vital to the @entity44 economy , accounting for over half of private sector employment and nearly half of all private sector turnover			2
the ability of @entity53 to access finance is important for funding business investment , ensuring businesses reach their growth potential , and for facilitating new business start - ups			0
the consultation will invite views from stakeholders and the industry on the policy proposals and will run until february 17 , 2014			0
the government then intends to bring forward legislation in the next session of @entity151			0
the consultation follows an announcement in last year ’s budget that it would ‘ investigate options for improving access to @entity53 credit data to make it easier for newer lenders to assess applications for loans to smaller businesses ’ .			2

@entity25 to propose @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 share ratings
this will make it easier for small banks to provide firms with cash
