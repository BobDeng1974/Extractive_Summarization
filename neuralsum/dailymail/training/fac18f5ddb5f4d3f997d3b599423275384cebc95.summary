by @entity0 published : 08:29 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 11:51 est , 6 september 2013 passengers will be offered the chance to buy an all - inclusive ticket by @entity4 for the first time in its 18 - year history in a move that could signal a change in direction for budget airliners			1
the @entity12 - based firm has announced it is to start offering some passengers the opportunity to pay one price for their ticket , which will entitle them to choose their seat , place their bag in the hold , and pay by credit card			1
up until now the firm has charged customers less than many of its rivals for the seat itself , but then boosted profits with a raft of costs for extra services , such as inflight food and drink , which other carriers include for free			0
change : @entity4 is to charge one price for an all - inclusive ticket for the first time in its 18 - year history the airline claims its new all - inclusive fare will be lower than if customers had chosen to book all the extras on top of their standard ticket			1
to begin with , the deal will only be available to business travellers who book through corporate systems			2
but it is still being seen as a sign that the giants of the budget airline market could be about to change the way they do business			1
some carriers , such as @entity56 firm @entity55 , even charge extra if customers book by credit and debit card when there is little alternative available			0
they argue that they are simply giving passengers the option to strip out extra costs that they do not need in order to secure the lowest possible price			1
rival : @entity55 boss @entity70 has argued customers should be given the option to strip out costs @entity4 , one of the no - frills pioneers since it set up in 1995 , is introducing an all inclusive fare in a bid to win more corporate travel bookings from big name rivals			1
they say that not only will the fare be cheaper than if customers were to buy each of the options separately , it will also be less time - consuming , a factor that might appeal to business travellers in particular			1
head of sales @entity85 said : ' we are really pleased to be able to offer an inclusive fare for the first time - part of our campaign to make ourselves easier to book and attractive to large corporates			2
' it will help us to compete even more effectively with the legacy carriers as well as providing further choice and value for the 10million - plus corporate travellers who choose to fly @entity4 every year			1
' business customers will still have the choice of paying existing standard fares if they are not taking a suitcase or do not mind which seat they get			2
all - inclusive : the airline claims the cost of the ticket will still be cheaper than prices offered by rival carriers some of the extra charges invoked by budget airlines have caused an outcry in the past			1
last year , @entity112 was furious after being charged £ 236 at @entity55 's check - in desk for printing out her boarding cards			2
mrs @entity115 usually printed them at home , but had forgotten to on that occasion			0
when she set up a @entity121 page asking people to support her if they thought she had been treated unfairly , 500,000 people gave her their backing			0
it did not cut any ice with chief executive @entity70 , who branded her ' stupid '			0
@entity55 has also been banned from advertising flights without the tax included to give the appearance of a cheaper fare , although it does continue to give the pre-tax price on its website			2
last month a flight from @entity134 to @entity135 was advertised for £ 42.99 , although that rose to £ 95.79 once taxes and other costs such as web check - in and an @entity141 levy are added			0
both @entity4 and @entity55 have capitalised on charging people for food , which other airlines include within the cost of the ticket			1
@entity4 charges £ 6 for its all - day breakfast , £ 1.80 for a cup of tea and £ 2 for a @entity151			1
@entity55 charges £ 2.50 for a cup of tea , £ 5 for a sandwich , and £ 5.20 for a small bottle of wine			0
last month mr @entity70 vowed to keep increasing the cost of placing luggage in the hold until nobody could afford to do it anymore			0
it now costs £ 50 to take place a 15kg bag in the hold for a return trip			0
@entity4 charges £ 26 for a 20kg bag			2
mr @entity70 said by increasing the charges the number of passengers placing luggage in the hold had fallen to 19 per cent , saving the airline ' a fortune in money '			0
in an interview he even suggested he might consider charging for hand luggage at some point in the future			0
both airlines charge customers extra to book using a credit card as opposed to a debit card			0
typically this is about two per cent of the total ticket price with @entity55 , while @entity4 charges slightly more at 2.5 per cent .			1

the move is being seen as a change in direction for budget airliners
@entity4 says the new ticket price will still be cheaper than rival *companies*
