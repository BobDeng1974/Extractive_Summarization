@entity0 has backed new @entity2 team - mate @entity1 to have a big impact for club and country this season			1
@entity1 joined the @entity7 on monday in a shock £ 16million move from @entity10			1
with @entity11 out for three months because of an ankle injury , @entity1 is likely to be thrown straight into @entity2 's first - team and he may now start in @entity16 's @entity15 qualifier in @entity17 on monday after @entity18 suffered an injury in training			1
' he is a great addition for @entity2 and hopefully he will keep performing for @entity16 as well , ' the @entity2 midfielder said			1
' he has got great enthusiasm , he wants to run , he will track back , and he has got great quality			0
' a lot of people do n't give him credit for his technical ability , but he is great on the ball			0
i am sure there were a few clubs wanting him and there are not many players his age who move from one big club to another big club so that shows his quality			2
' @entity18 was sent for a scan after suffering an injury in training at @entity55 on friday - two days before the squad departs for @entity17			1
transfer : @entity1 joined @entity2 from @entity10 , and may go straight in to the side it was an injury scare @entity60 could do without , especially after the negative backlash that followed @entity16 's uninspiring 1 - 0 win over the @entity63			1
just 40,181 people turned up to watch the victory , which came courtesy of a @entity68 penalty			0
the 22 - year - old thinks @entity16 can start to win the fans back by beating the @entity71 in @entity72 on monday night			1
' going over to @entity17 is a tough game we know if we put in the performance and get the result the fans are going to come back on our side , ' said @entity0 , who thinks the negative reaction to @entity16 's winless @entity81 campaign has been over the top			1
criticism : @entity0 has been criticised by @entity85 and @entity86 for his performances ' if people analysed it a bit more they would have been a bit kinder , there were just a few individual errors and a few lapses in concentration , but at that level that is what you are going to get , ' he added			2
' when you are playing against ( @entity100 ) @entity99 and ( @entity102 ) @entity101 that is what you are going to get , they are going to punish you and they did			0
' but if you look at the games , we had more positives than people give us credit for			0
' @entity0 only started one game at the @entity81 - the lifeless , miserable dead rubber against @entity112 in @entity113			2
but with @entity114 and @entity115 now retired , he is one of the first names on the team sheet			0
future : with @entity115 and @entity114 retiring from international football , @entity0 is the future many pundits , including ex-internationals like @entity85 and @entity86 , have cast doubt on his ability recently , claiming he has not lived up to the hype that surrounded him when he made his @entity16 debut four years ago			1
injury has hindered the 21 - cap midfielder , but he says he is now almost back to peak fitness			0
' it is a big season for me			0
i have never hid away from that , ' @entity0 added			2
' i have had a good pre-season for the first time in a few years , i have trained every session , played in all but one of the games			0
' i feel good , i am getting stronger and stronger , i am getting near to where i want to be			0
' @entity0 knows he and @entity138 , who wore the number four shirt vacated by @entity114 on wednesday , have big shoes to fill			2
' obviously it 's disappointing when @entity114 and @entity115 retired , they were massive players for @entity16 , over the last 10 years they were great ambassadors and that is the level me and @entity138 have got to get to , ' @entity0 said .			1

@entity1 joined @entity2 from @entity146 for £ 16million
@entity11 's injury might mean @entity1 goes straight into the team
@entity0 claimed new signing can have a big impact on the club
@entity1 may start against @entity17 for @entity16 in @entity15 qualifier
