ministers took action after concerns that a rising number of councils have been making the installation of @entity12 a legal condition of granting licences to pubs the change comes after the @entity33 , the @entity34 ’s privacy watchdog , said that it was becoming seriously concerned by the profusion of @entity12 even in trouble - free pubs			1
surveillance camera systems are widely used in @entity38 and @entity39 , but community pubs minister @entity40 said things had gone too far			2
he said the principle of surveillance by consent is at the heart of the new legislation , so the public can be confident that cameras are not there to spy on them but to protect them			0
he has laid a new code of practice before @entity54 for approval , as part of the @entity57			0
mr @entity40 said : ‘ cctv has a role to play in stopping and deterring crime in anti-social behaviour hotspots			0
under the new regime , local authorities will be subject to a stricter code of practice designed to strike a better balance between privacy and security for drinkers ' but well - run pubs that do n’t have a public order problem should n’t be tarred with the same brush			1
‘ the public deserves to have a pint in peace without being snooped on			0
this government has called time on big brother ’s secret , intrusive and costly rules that have forced pub landlords to pay to install cctv where it was not needed			0
‘ the use of surveillance cameras should be used only if it is necessary and where it has public support			0
’ last night @entity87 , director of privacy campaign group @entity88 , said : ‘ people should be able to enjoy a quiet pint without being constantly recorded on camera			1
‘ this announcement brings some long overdue common sense to a situation where councils were driving up the cost of a pint by demanding pubs spend thousands of pounds on cctv where there are no problems to deal with			1
‘ our privacy is too important to be undermined by a tick - box on a licensing form			2
‘ i ’m sure landlords across the country will join me in raising a glass to @entity40 for defending people ’s local pubs from needless surveillance cameras			0

councils will have to strike a better balance between privacy and security
the @entity33 is concerned at use of @entity12 even in quiet pubs
