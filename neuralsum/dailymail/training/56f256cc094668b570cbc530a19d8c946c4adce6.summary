@entity0 blew men ’s tennis off its axis on saturday night when he caused a sensational upset to overcome @entity5 and reach the @entity7 final			1
the 24 - year - old , from @entity9 , braved fierce heat and humidity to beat the world no 1 6 - 4 , 1 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 in two hours 52 minutes and become the first male from his country to reach a @entity15 in the modern era			1
he was left awaiting the winner of the second semi-final between @entity21 and no 14 seed @entity22 , for whom the stakes were substantially raised			0

’ trained at the @entity71 @entity70 in @entity72 from the age of 11 , @entity0 ’s experience of the fierce @entity69 summer heat came into its own as he refused to flag against @entity5 , who suffered in the furnace that the @entity76 became			2
pushed : @entity5 stretches for a backhand against @entity0 in their @entity7 semi-final underdog : @entity0 shocked the world no 1 in their meeting in @entity84 his coach @entity85 seemed more animated than he ever was as a player as he watched from the bench , urging on his young charge , who lost in the first round of this event last year to @entity93 outsider @entity92			1
@entity0 showed his potential earlier this year when he should have beaten @entity95 on clay in @entity97 before seizing up with cramp , but this did not happen when in sight of the biggest win of his career			2
his backhand was especially punishing as he took the first set , only for normal service seemingly to be resumed when @entity5 bounced back in the second by making him run all over the place			0
the @entity9 failed to serve out the third set at 5 - 4 and it seemed his chance might have been blown , especially as he conceded the break back with a double fault			1
frustration : @entity112 remonstrates with the umpire as he is shocked by the world no 11 helpless : @entity5 was formidable in the second set but @entity0 was otherwise in control yet in the tie - break , in which both players were extremely nervous and double faulted once each , it was his mental strength that just about held out and he took it 7 - 4 — crucial , given the expectation that he might fade towards the end of the match			1
that did not happen and it was @entity5 who became more erratic in the heat of the afternoon , going down an early break in the fourth and never threatening to get it back against an opponent who , while not physically imposing , is a terrific mover around the court			0
@entity0 got safely to 5 - 3 in the fourth and then broke once more for good measure when @entity5 drove a final forehand long			1
