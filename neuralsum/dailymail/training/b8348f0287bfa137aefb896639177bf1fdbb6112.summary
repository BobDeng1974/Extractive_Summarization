@entity0 is still in the ' maybe ' category for the 2016 presidential sweepstakes , judging from an interview published tuesday			1
the former @entity5 governor and 2012 also - ran said his thinking on a third try for the @entity8 has boiled down to a line from the @entity11 movie ' @entity12			1
' in the movie , @entity11 's goofy character @entity12 is spurned by a love interest who says there 's a one - in - a - million chance she would be with him			1
officially , he 's not running			2
' i love the country enough to know that i 'm not as good a candidate this time around as i think the other guys would be , ' he told @entity35			2
' i want the country to win			0
i do not want to see @entity45 as our next president			2
' but unofficially , he 's staying in touch with his 2012 team of aides and consultants			0
asked if he identified personally with the @entity11 quote , @entity0 would only tell the @entity54 , ' i have nothing to add to the story			1
' but then came the latest non-denial - denial : ' we 've got a lot of people looking at the race			0
we ’ll see what happens			0
' @entity63 @entity64 columnist @entity63 assembled a list of 15 reasons why @entity0 should sit out 2016 and remain the @entity68 's elder statesman , including : the long - time pol 's wife @entity69 said during a @entity72 interview on sept. 23 that ' @entity0 and i are not making plans			1
' but when host @entity76 pointed out that @entity77 only won the presidency after failing twice , she smiled			0
' well , we will see , wo n't we , @entity80 ? ' mrs. @entity0 said			2
if former @entity82 gov. @entity81 were to throw his hat into the ring , she suggested , it might preclude a @entity0 three - fer since the two men would compete for the same centrist , non-tea - party base			1
but in a late august poll of likely @entity68 voters in @entity32 , @entity81 came in a disappointing fifth place out of a field of 13 potential candidates , with barely 7 per cent support			0
placing ahead of him were @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and ' undecided			0
' when @entity0 's name was added as a 14th option in the poll , he crushed the competition with more than 35 per cent			1
@entity81 shrank to below a 5 per cent showing – 7th place			0
as his poll numbers go up , @entity0 is attracting a dedicated cadre of true believers who are eager to capitalize on the buyer 's remorse of disaffected @entity112 voters			1
more than 120,000 of them have clicked the approval of a ' @entity0 ' petition , but that support may be soft : the draft committee 's @entity118 account has just 173 followers			1
and for every die - hard @entity0 backer , there seems to be an equal and opposite detractor			1
the naysayers tend to have the biggest megaphones			0
tanned , rested and ready : more than 120,000 @entity126 have signed an online petition encouraging the 2012 also - ran to take a third plunge into presidential politics @entity63 , the left - leaning @entity64 's resident center - right columnist , opined monday night that @entity0 should stay away from the 2016 race for the good of the @entity68			1
@entity0 ' was right about a host of issues , most especially on foreign policy , ' she wrote			2
' his obvious prowess as an executive is badly needed in the @entity8			0
' ' i find it nearly impossible to believe he would n’t have been a better choice for the country than president @entity112 has been			0
but he should not run for president a third time			0
' what followed was a list of 15 reasons @entity0 should retire gracefully , or perhaps tee himself up as a potential treasury secretary appointee			2
chief among them : ' in promoting an anti-elitism message , the @entity68 has the upper hand against @entity45 – unless @entity0 runs			1

@entity0 told a @entity54 *reporter* that his thinking *mirrors* a line from the movie ' @entity12 '
spurned by a woman who says there 's a one - in - a - million chance she would be with him , @entity11 's character @entity12 replies : ' so you 're telling me there 's a chance ? '
a *coy* @entity0 said he has ' nothing to add to the story '
but the @entity64 's resident center - right columnist is *begging* him to hang up his campaign for good
@entity0 's ' self - *deportation* ' policy and his ' *47* per cent ' gaffe will doom him , @entity63 says , and he *'ll* never be able to target @entity45 as an elitist
