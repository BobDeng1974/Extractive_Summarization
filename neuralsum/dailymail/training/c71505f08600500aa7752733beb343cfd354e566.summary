intelligence services were last night trying to trace an @entity2 doctor who was part of a terror cell that kidnapped and shot a @entity6 photographer in @entity7			1
the @entity9 - wielding medic is part of an extremist gang that held veteran war photographer @entity12 and a fellow western journalist hostage for a week			1
a heavily bearded @entity15 fanatic , he told his prisoners he had taken a sabbatical from his @entity2 job to wage a ‘ holy war ’ in @entity7			1
captive : @entity12 , who was shot in the arm when he tried to escape the camp in @entity7 , said his @entity6 - born captor planned to return to a role in the @entity2 he also told them that he was planning to return to his senior post in a @entity29 @entity28 department			1

’ the medic , who said he was 28 and had a wife and child in @entity6 , was also among the leaders of a group who were planning to behead ‘ spies ’ and was furious when the execution of two @entity7 he believed to be undercover agents was halted			1
it comes just days after the intelligence services warned that dozens of @entity6 , many thought to be of @entity63 origin , were going to @entity7 to wage jihad , or holy war			1
the concern is that they will return to the @entity6 radicalised and pose a security problem			1

‘ this is a man who has taken an oath to save people and help them , and here he is walking around with a @entity9 and preaching sharia law			0
there are not any doctors who i know that do that			0
‘ he clearly believed in what he was doing but to follow something to that extreme is the disturbing thing			0
he was visibly upset when the execution was called off			0
’ in a macabre twist , the doctor , who spoke in a @entity29 accent and kept his face covered with sunglasses and a scarf – said he was glad of the experience in @entity7 as when he returned to @entity6 he wanted to specialise in trauma injuries			1
mr @entity12 added : ‘ he said treating jihadists wounded in battle was good training and had a pack of gauzes , medicine , iv drips and medical gear			2

he was very well - trained			2
’ mr @entity12 and his colleague were captured when they went to a camp they had previously visited , unaware that terrorists had since taken it over			1
he said of the doctor : ‘ i asked for his help as we were both from @entity29 but he refused to even send a text to my girlfriend to say we were alive			1
he said he would be beheaded if he did			0
‘ he said , “ i ca n’t be in here too long because the other guys say i ’m too nice to you ”			0
’ the doctor , who is believed to be of @entity63 descent , was among around 15 @entity6 nationals at the terror camp , just inside @entity7 ’s border , many of whom had @entity29 accents			1
they were part of a 40 - strong cell called @entity143 , which aims to convert @entity7 to sharia law			1
mr @entity12 , pictured , said he was still eager to return to @entity7 to report on the war despite his traumatic experience when mr @entity12 tried to escape on the second of his seven days in captivity , one of those who opened fire was @entity6 , wounding him in the elbow and his @entity38 friend in the leg			1
he said : ‘ afterwards the doctor was the guy who treated us			2
‘ he stabilised @entity37 with saline drips , that had @entity2 logos , gave him antibiotics and stitched his wound			2
his assistant , another @entity163 , bandaged my wounds			0
this guy had shot at me as we tried to escape			0
mr @entity12 was captured last month with @entity38 colleague @entity37 , pictured ' he also smacked the butt of his @entity9 into my head after we were recaptured			2
some of the @entity169 were vindictive			0
’ he said that after this , the doctor ‘ came into the tent where i was handcuffed and blindfolded			2
the militants had smacked me about as they claimed i was the leader of the escape			0
‘ he said , “ i ’m very disappointed in you , @entity12			2
before this you were going to be ransomed , but now i do n’t know			0
i told you to have patience , that it would be ok			0
now it will be bad ”			0
‘ it was n’t much fun expecting to end up on an execution video at the hands of extremists – one of whom was treating londoners like me a few months ago			0
’ the next day , to mr @entity12 ’s horror , he saw a trestle table being erected and heard knives being sharpened , but later learned these were for two @entity7 who were eventually spared after repenting and promising to follow sharia law			1
he added : ‘ the doctor was annoyed			0
he said they should ’ve been beheaded because they were @entity7 spies			2
’ throughout his ordeal , mr @entity12 was kept handcuffed in a tent			2
on one occasion he heard the doctor on the phone to his family			0
he added : ‘ he was saying , “ @entity206 , how ’s the little ‘ un ? put him on and let me hear him ”			0
’ at another point , he even complained to his hostages about the state of the @entity2			2
‘ he told us the @entity2 is good if you ’re in a serious accident but if you ’re on a hip replacement waiting list it ’s terrible , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
unrest : mr @entity12 and mr @entity37 were eventually rescued by @entity7 rebels			1
@entity217 , a member of the @entity218 runs for cover during clashes with army soldiers in @entity224 's @entity223 district this week clashes : fighting is ongoing in @entity7 as rebel fighters attempt to wrest control from president @entity42 's army			1
