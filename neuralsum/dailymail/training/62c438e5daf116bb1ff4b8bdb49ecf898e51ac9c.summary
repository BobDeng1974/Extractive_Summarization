@entity0 : @entity1 : @entity2 scored the only goal of the game early on as @entity0 beat @entity1 1 - 0 in @entity5 in their first group game of the @entity7			1
@entity2 turned home @entity10 's mishit in the fifth minute , as @entity0 failed to build on a quick start against the @entity13 champions			1
see how the match panned out by scrolling through the text commentary below			0
host commentator host commentator host commentator an opportunity for both sides in the final moments as @entity20 makes a good save for @entity0 , before @entity23 breaks and nearly finds @entity24 with a reverse pass			1
so , @entity0 open up their @entity7 campaign with a win ... but we probably expected more goals after @entity2 put the @entity30 ahead after 5 minutes			1
some rustiness from @entity0 , and they face @entity32 on wednesday night not sure what to make of this performance from a @entity0 perspective			1
solid in some areas , unconvincing in others			0
@entity1 have had more than enough opportunities to score , while @entity0 have only had one clear - cut opportunity from which they scored			1
the performance of @entity42 , though , will be encouraging to all @entity30 fans			1
the @entity44 was perhaps @entity0 's best player			1
what an opportunity for @entity47 as @entity24 gives away possession in the worst possible area - central , with no cover and 40 yards from goal			2
@entity47 speeds through , skipping through @entity52 but he ca n't reach the ball after going round @entity20			0
he did n't go down after the challenge from the goalkeeper , but perhaps he should have			0
' more changes and now @entity2 ’s afternoon is over			1
he spoke impressively on friday about how he will deal with the expectation and pressure that is going to be on him next season but he has the tools to deal with that ; this was an exciting cameo from the 19 - year - old , one that augurs well for him developing again when it really matters			2
' @entity69 , who has looked very bright since coming on , unleashes a piling effort from 25 yards , which fizzes just wide of the @entity1 goal			1
@entity10 comes off for @entity73 , as @entity2 makes way for @entity23			1
@entity1 still pressing forward in search of an equaliser , and @entity47 , who scored a superb goal against @entity78 on thursday , hits one high and wide over @entity20 ' goal			1
and here 's @entity2 giving @entity0 the lead early on ( @entity82 ) @entity69 does brilliantly well to give the ball to @entity84 but his cross evades everyone , and then at the other end @entity87 makes another superb interception from @entity90 's through ball			1
more changes on their way for @entity0 on the hour mark , with @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity52 coming on for @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 @entity100 has a shot from range , and @entity20 had to show some interest in it as it nearly creeps in the @entity0 goal			1
it 's been a bit flat here from @entity0 , as it was in @entity110 last week			1
@entity111 will want the intensity to increase soon , especially given @entity32 's ruthless 5 - 1 win over @entity78 earlier tonight			1
' the substitutions have started and @entity0 have replaced the lively @entity42 and @entity115 , as well as left - back @entity116 , with @entity69 , @entity24 and @entity84			1
@entity69 is a player whose progress needs charting this summer			0
' @entity111 has described him as “ the brain ” of @entity0 ’s team but for all his talent , there is no guarantee yet that he is going to be a starter from the word go			1
should he play as he did against @entity126 on wednesday , however , @entity69 might make @entity111 ’ decision easy			2
' he looked like a high - class performer in @entity110 and maybe this challenge will inspire him further			0
' so unlucky for @entity130 , who gets into the penalty area on the break and strikes the woodwork from 15 yards			0
@entity20 was rooted to the spot			0
@entity135 then gets a few yards of space in a similar area , but his shot dragged just wide to the left of @entity20 ' goal			0
@entity69 , @entity24 and @entity84 come on for @entity116 , @entity115 and @entity42			0
@entity87 gets a vital touch on the ball after a dangerous ball into the box nearly found @entity135			0
@entity1 have been competitive so far , and have worried @entity0 throughout			1
olympiacos are keeping the ball beautifully around @entity0 's penalty area , with @entity148 dropping deep to get involved			2
the ball drops to the @entity150 , with just @entity20 to beat , but @entity116 recovers well to put the ball out for a corner			0
the corner goes short and finds @entity153 , but his effort drags wide			0
@entity42 slips through two tackles on the left corner of the penalty area , and his curling effort has too much on it as it goes two yards high and wide			0
great play from the 20 - year - old @entity44 , who has looked exciting so far			0
@entity97 calmly clears the ball under pressure , but it 's @entity1 with the ball so far ... until @entity0 break through @entity42 and @entity2 ... but the latter 's ball ca n't find @entity167 , who would have had a one - on - one on the left			1
@entity99 's corner is punched clear by @entity170 in the @entity1 goal			2
' interesting to watch @entity99 operating here			0
when @entity0 played @entity1 in the @entity172 10 years ago , @entity99 was a marauding midfielder , who operated high and dynamically around the opposition area			1
' now , in this new role , @entity99 sits deep and performs like a quarter - back , dropping deep , splitting his central defenders and launching attacks			0
his influence on this team going forward should not be understated			0
' as for the atmosphere here , it is lively without being anything you would associate with the @entity185			0
suggestions that @entity187 would be full to its 61,000 capacity have proven a little over optimistic			0
' aha , there 's a glimpse of @entity42 in full flow			0
the new signing paces through the @entity1 midfield before being brought down on the edge of the area cynically			2
he limps off but should be okay ... as @entity10 's free - kick hits the wall before @entity99 's follow up goes well wide			0
@entity148 brings a great blocked save out of @entity20 , but he is called offside after a quickly - taken free - kick on the left			0
it nearly , very nearly , caught out the @entity0 defence , who are living dangerously at the moment			2
@entity1 attack again , and @entity135 has a chance to blast the ball on the volley , but it 's blocked well by @entity87			2
@entity0 have n't got into too much of a rhythm since scoring , as @entity116 cleans up with @entity148 looking dangerous for the @entity13 side			1
' so here we are in @entity187 and there is a good chance this @entity0 side will be close to how @entity111 lines up on the first day of the campaign against @entity217			1
' @entity99 is lying deep with @entity115 and @entity167 alongside , while @entity2 – scorer of @entity0 ’s first goal here – @entity42 and @entity10 are providing the threat			1
' the defence will be reshaped , especially as @entity222 has just signed , but this is the base @entity111 will work off			2
' @entity97 loses the ball @entity130 , who piles into the box , but his curling effort does n't trouble @entity20 , going wide of the goal			0
that was poor from @entity97 , who predictably turned inside towards @entity20 , and was n't fouled by the @entity1 man			2
@entity2 ! it was a tad fortunate , but @entity0 wo n't care about that			1
they lead after five minutes at @entity187			0
@entity10 wound up a long shot from outside the area , but he missed his kick			0
luckily , the ball fell nicely into the path of @entity2 to tuck away from six yards			2
1 - 0 to @entity0			1
@entity0 , wearing their ' @entity237 ' style third kit , get us underway at @entity187 , home to the @entity241 @entity240 team			2
@entity99 is leading his team - mates out of the tunnel and onto the pitch @entity244 in @entity5			0
game looks set to kick - off about 10 minutes late as it stands , but stay with us for all the action as it happens			2
@entity32 are currently dishing out a severe beating to @entity78			1
@entity251 's men are 5 - 1 up courtesy of two goals from @entity254 and strikes from @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			2

the @entity273 had been expected to join up with @entity111 ' squad in @entity275 after the two clubs agreed an £ 8.5million fee , but he did n't pass the club 's medical tests in @entity110 earlier this week			2
