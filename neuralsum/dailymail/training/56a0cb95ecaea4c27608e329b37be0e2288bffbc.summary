the charity raised more than £ 20,000 and helped build an extension to the group ’s guide hut			1
' he chaired our friends of @entity40 and was responsible for overseeing the upkeep of the building for many years , ' said ms @entity28			1
' thanks to @entity45 ’s efforts hundreds of girls were able to enjoy the fun , friendship and adventure of guiding in a safe environment			2
' we were extremely saddened to hear of @entity45 's passing and our thoughts are with his family at this sad time			1
' royal @entity11 ’s deputy mayor @entity55 added : ‘ the whole thing is a tragedy , both for his family and for the town as a whole			1
‘ he and his wife have been involved in youth organisations for many years			2
not only is the family going to suffer , the town is going to suffer too			1
‘ the motto of the town is “ we honour those who serve ” and it ’s not just military people , it ’s people who serve the community , which he has done			1
’ wild boar numbers have risen in nearby @entity74 and a wild one may have been involved in the crash mr @entity8 lived in a quiet cul - de - sac in the town with his wife and two children in their early 20s , according to neighbours			1
one said : ' they 've been there a long time			2
it 's just so sad			2
' my neighbour came around last night and asked if i 'd heard the news			2
its just such an awful thing to happen			1
' they have got two children who i believe are older , university age			2
' the accident , which took place just before 7pm on monday , happened less than two miles from a farm which has bred 200 wild boar			1
wild boar were hunted to extinction in @entity98 several centuries ago			2
but their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last fifteen years			2
there are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside			2
boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans			2
when fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft			2
they can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph			2
in medieval times , boar from the @entity116 were supplied for the @entity119 table - there is a record of an order for 100 boars and sows for a @entity126 feast in 1254			2
boar are known to inhabit parts of the @entity129 and the @entity74			2
the animals have roamed wild in the @entity74 in 2004 , after a 700 year absence			0
they started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations			0
since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards , gardens and grass verges			0
farming of wild boar in @entity98 became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the @entity146 mainland were kept under the @entity147			0
however police and owners of the @entity150 said the animal involved in the accident was not from the site			1
after the car hit the animal it was then struck by a white @entity157 articulated lorry , police said			1
the motorway was closed for eight hours until 1am on tuesday			1
sergeant @entity159 said : ' this is a truly tragic incident and my thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim			1
' it is quite rare for a wild boar to be on the carriageway of the motorway			1
it is more common for the police to receive calls involving horses or deer but each is equally dangerous to motorists			0
' this was a particularly large wild animal and would have caused considerable damage to any vehicle			1
' i would appeal for anyone with any information about the incident to contact us as soon as possible			0
' the driver of the car was killed instantly and the lorry driver did not suffer any serious injuries in the accident			1
the boar is also thought to have died in the crash			1
populations of wild boar have risen recently , particularly in the @entity74 where the animals have caused havoc by digging up a cemetery and damaging a roadside verge			0
there are fears populations of the wild pigs are rising out of control after a number of recent incidents where they have invaded and destroyed playgrounds and football pitches			0
a spokesman for @entity206 said that officers were baffled as to how the wild boar came to be wandering in the motorway - with the nearest colonies thought to be in the @entity74 in @entity211 and in @entity212			1
the last time a wild boar was seen in @entity12 was on the on the @entity214 in december 2009			1
wild boar were hunted almost to extinction but have started to return to the @entity98 in the last 15 years , with populations growing in the @entity129 and @entity74 - near the crash site			1
they can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown			1
the animals can also jump 6ft			0
@entity222 , who owns the @entity150 that breeds the animal for salami , said : ' wild boar do travel and they are prepared to travel quite a distance			1
it 's only a matter of time before they start causing trouble			0
' it was n't one of ours involved			0
they are all behind a big fence			0
i have heard of boar coming up from the @entity74 though			0
they would have been here about three to four hundred years ago but they are not common any more			0
' you always here rumours of them being around though			0
it 's not very often they 're spotted here			0
it 's much more common in @entity248 and @entity249 where it 's much quieter			0
in the area we 've always tried to keep them away for this very reason			0
residents in @entity256 in the @entity74 had their gardens damaged by the beasts last year ' this incident is one of those horrific things that happens when they are around			0
boar are very hard and very dense			0
' a children 's playground was left destroyed in november after a herd of wild boar grazed on the land in the @entity74 for two months			0
homeowners in @entity256 also reported damage to their gardens			0
rangers say the @entity116 of @entity74 wild boar population is doubling every year thanks to the spread of commercial crops such as maize			0
in 2013 people living in and around the @entity74 said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby			0
wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the @entity282 beauty spot on @entity283 outside @entity284			0
the animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the @entity288 announced a cull on the population			0
in 2008 one had to be shot at @entity291 and two years later the animals destroyed a football pitch .			0
