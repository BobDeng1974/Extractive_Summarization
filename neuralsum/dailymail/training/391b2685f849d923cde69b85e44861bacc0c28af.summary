by @entity0 last updated at 1:25 pm on 4th october 2011 for years , the more energy - conscious among us have habitually switched off lights in empty rooms and made sure televisions are never left on stand - by			2
but it appears these daily efforts to cut ever - rising bills could be in vain as our increasing reliance on electronic gadgets means we are consuming more electricity than five years ago			2
as a result , @entity15 will miss its 2020 domestic appliance carbon reduction target by seven million tons , a report by the @entity14 warned today			1
hi - tech home : large plasma - screen tvs , tumble dryers and fridge - freezers , particularly those with an ice - maker , are the worst energy - usage offenders study author dr @entity25 said : ' our love affair with domestic gadgets and gizmos has to change			1
' just because you have bought an efficient appliance , does n’t mean you can use it carelessly and never switch it off			2
' households now own three - and - a - half times as many electricity - powered gadgets as they did 20 years ago			2
among the worst offenders in eating up energy are large plasma - screen tvs , tumble dryers and fridge - freezers , particularly those with an ice - maker			1
the rise is also the result of a marked decrease in the number of appliances that run off disposable batteries			0
the government had set a target of reducing 1990 carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020			1
almost a third of the @entity15 's carbon dioxide emissions come from the home			1
in 2009 , the average @entity15 household contained three - and - a - half times as many gadgets and appliances as it did in 1990			1
if every household in @entity15 replaced their old fridge freezer , washing machine and dishwasher with the most efficient , they could collectively save £ 585million on fuel bills , the report claims			1
changes : electricity use and projected demand between 1990 and 2020 such a widespread switch would also prevent two million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere , the equivalent of filling @entity72 with gas 257 times			1
dr @entity74 said : ' our domestic choices and behaviour in our homes can make a bigger impact than people think			2
' we need to ask ourselves is that ice - maker in the fridge a necessity ? do i need to leave those chargers on the whole time ? do i need a 50 + inch tv screen ? ' there ’s more to this issue than using energy efficient light bulbs			1
not only can people cut their carbon footprint , but they can also bring down their electricity bills considerably			2
' designer @entity93 , who has worked on award - winning eco-friendly housing projects , insists it is not too late to act			0
he said : ' this report is clearly a kick up the backside to all of us who imagine that we are taking big steps to a more sustainable future			0
' clearly we are not going to reverse , nor do we want to reverse the tremendous technological strides that mankind is making			0
' but we must harness all this creativity to ensure that we are not storing up an environmental time bomb that will lead future generations to regret our technological advances			0
' the report - called @entity110 - found there has been good progress since 2006 in improving standards and legislation such as banning patio heaters and incandescent light bulbs			0
but the findings also picked up worrying trends in consumer energy usage			0
experts point to the popularity of home computers and all the extra gadgets that go with them - in 1985 only 13 per cent of the population owned a computer , but by 2009 ownership levels had topped 75 per cent			1
leaving your printer turned on permanently , even though you only use it for a few minutes a day , vastly increase your electricity bill			0
although many household appliances such as fridges are now more energy efficient than in 1990 this is being undermined by our preference for larger @entity138 - style products			0
similarly , our move towards larger washing machines has the potential to reduce energy use if this means fewer washes - but often no change in washing behaviour makes them a bigger burden on household bills			0
the @entity14 is an independent body set up to help householders reduce their energy bills and combat climate change .			0

computers , plasma tvs , fridge - freezers and tumble dryers to blame
@entity15 will miss its 2020 domestic appliance carbon reduction target ' by 7 million tons '
