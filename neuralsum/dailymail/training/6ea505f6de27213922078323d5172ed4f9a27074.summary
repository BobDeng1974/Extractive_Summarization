since friday , it has been drilling a six - inch exploratory borehole 3,000ft into the @entity15 shale and limestone in search of oil and gas			1
although there are no immediate plans to use fracking at the site , the controversial technique is expected to be deployed if fuel reserves are found			1
opponents say the process causes tremors , noise and pollution			0
if used , the night sky around the village of @entity3 in @entity46 could become lit up with ‘ flares ’ of burning gas similar to those seen on oil rigs			1
campaigners at the gate : the protest camp outside the drill site has generated a lot of publicity green and pleasant land : the @entity1 drill site surrounded by thousands of acres of unspoilt countryside pictures of the @entity3 rig emerged as @entity61 declared it would be a ‘ tragedy ’ if @entity11 does not take advantage of shale gas exploration			1
in a controversial intervention , the chancellor distanced himself from comments made by his father - in - law @entity68 last week , in which the @entity70 peer claimed that fracking should only take place in the ‘ desolate ’ @entity74			1
mr @entity61 said : ‘ it would be a real tragedy for @entity11 to basically allow this energy revolution to bypass our country			0
more than 30 campaigners , including the daughter of singers @entity83 and @entity84 , have been arrested after clashes with police outside the site people protest against oil exploration in @entity3 , @entity46 on sunday after energy company @entity1 began drilling at the site fracking involves pumping water , sand and chemicals deep underground at high pressure to crack rocks and retrieve the natural gas trapped inside ‘ it would mean we would have much higher energy costs than other countries , it would mean jobs would go to those other countries and businesses would go to those other countries , and we would all pay a very heavy price for that			1
’ but residents from @entity3 have made it clear they are opposed to any such thing			1

it is also looking to acquire up to six more sites for shale gas exploration			2
@entity119 could begin on two of these as early as 2014			0
despite living in neighbouring @entity122 , energy minister @entity121 is keen that the dash for gas extends across a vast swathe of the @entity126			0
he said there may be opportunities to exploit shale gas from @entity130 , through @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity15 and @entity122			2
yesterday @entity133 endorsed his enthusiasm			0
asked about the energy minister ’s assertion , the prime minister ’s official spokesman said : ‘ the pm has no reason to think that @entity121 is wrong about that			0
‘ the prime minister thinks that shale gas represents an exciting potential resource for @entity11 that could contribute to our energy security			2
‘ @entity146 will only be allowed where it is safe and poses no risk to the environment			0
’ mr @entity61 made it clear that communities where shale gas extraction takes place will be compensated			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve designed a regime that is very generous for local communities where this activity might take place			0
’ but @entity160 , of @entity161 , said : ‘ fracking poses a real threat to the local environment and causes more climate - wrecking pollution			2
