by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 14 april 2013 following back - to - back sunshine breaks in @entity2 and @entity4 heiress @entity3 was back to work on thursday launching her latest shoe collection in @entity7			1
the 22 - year - old has hit the headlines this year thanks to a high profile romance with @entity12 's ex @entity11 , but he was nowhere to be seen as the tycoon 's daughter and her mother @entity15 threw an exclusive event in @entity17 to unveil her new designs to the fashion press			2
the first two collections , designed by @entity3 and her team and stocked in @entity22 as well as @entity4 ( of course ) as well as on @entity3 's website , defied critics to become a commercial success and the businesswoman is hoping the latest shoe and accessory line will follow suit			1
@entity3 has unveiled her third high street shoe collection @entity3 said : ' i have learned a lot since my first collection			1
instead of just creating shoes that i would like i 'm learning about designing for my market , which includes a lot of tall people that i had n't expected , clubbers , people on holiday and girls out for dinner , as well as my mum			0
' i get brilliant feedback from customers who like what i 'm doing and now my biggest challenge is to keep bringing them back each season by reworking their favourites as well as giving them something new			0
' even in the @entity53 or @entity54 world of shoes the classic styles are available season after season , they are just revamped with new detail			0
' the first two collections defied critics to become a commercial success and the label is now stocked at @entity22 as well as @entity4 and on @entity3 's own site the new collection includes stacked platforms and mega wedges , all featuring @entity3 's signature green sole as a petite girl growing up in the world of fashion very high heels were an early necessity for @entity73 's only daughter			1
she said : '' what do you do when you are a short 14 - year - old and your friends all start growing taller and leaving you behind ? you find the highest pair of heels your mother owns and start trying to walk in them			0
' i spent a lot of my early teenage years practising walking in my mum 's shoes , and now she is one of my biggest fans ... she wears my shoes more than i do			1
' talking about the collection which this season includes skyscraper wedges , stacked platforms and studded sandals as well as hi - top trainers all with a distinctive jade green sole , @entity3 said : ' they are fast fashion shoes but they are also a bit exclusive - it 's nice that you wo n't see many people in the same style as you on a night out			1
' we have bought the styles on , but you have to always be proud of what you design and be able to stand by it and i am proud of the shoes in all three of my collections because they are all very me			0
' @entity3 said : '' my biggest challenge is to keep bringing my customers back each season by reworking their favourites as well as giving them something new			1
' @entity3 's relationship with boyfriend @entity11 has raised eyebrows due to the 22 year age gap , but the tycoon 's daughter admitted that she does n't let him being twice her age stop her telling him what to wear			1
she told @entity120 : ' i get the odd question of ' do you like what i 'm wearing ? ' and i 'm like , ' no not really '			0
then he says , ' how would you wear it ? '			0
i 'll then say , ' make it a bit cooler - wear it with some trainers and a t - shirt			1
' he 's then , ' okay , i 'm not sure , but if you like it , i like it			2
' @entity133 is obviously a fan of her work , but he 's not her only celebrity supporter			1
she said : ' @entity138 has been great			2
she saw my collection and loved it and wanted to wear my shoes			2
@entity141 has been really supportive			2
' if people do n't like it they are going to say something about it so it 's just so amazing to have had such great feedback			0
like @entity150 told me she likes my shoes and i was like , ' you do n't just have to say that			2
' but she said she loved them because they are so comfortable			0
' a lot of moisturiser will make them easier to get on			0
baby powder and a platform will make them more comfortable , but my absolute tip is not to take them off			0
shoes can be as high as you like as long as they are comfortable ( and believe it or not we work hard to make even the highest of the @entity167 heels comfortable )			0
the collection includes rocky accessories and pretty printed scarves @entity3 has been wearing high heels since the age of 14 @entity3 in @entity2 with boyfriend @entity11 ( centre ) ahead of friend @entity175 's wedding			1

the @entity178 / *summer* range is @entity3 's third shoe collection
the 20 piece range is available in @entity4 , @entity22 and online
celebrity fans include @entity141 , @entity138 and @entity150
heiress claims that she often tells @entity133 , *44* , to make his look a little cooler
