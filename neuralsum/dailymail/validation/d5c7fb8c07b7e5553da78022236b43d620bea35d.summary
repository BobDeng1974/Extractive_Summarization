there are two players in the @entity3 era who have left @entity5 feeling utterly helpless and wondering how on earth he can compete			0
@entity8 , of course , is his old friend @entity8			0
and the other is @entity11			1
as it turned out , @entity5 , like everyone else , did n’t have to worry about beating the @entity14 because he was too busy beating himself			0
@entity11 vehemently denies a failed test for recreational drugs use prompted him to take a six - month leave of absence that caused him to miss the @entity19 last year			1
whether that is true or not , there were plenty of other party - style vices he did own up to that needed addressing and were enough by themselves to turn an obvious world top - three player into one struggling to stay in the top 20			2
@entity14 @entity11 ( left ) won the @entity31 on sunday @entity5 hits onto the 18th green after his ball landed near a tree at the @entity31 @entity5 holds @entity11 in the same regard as fellow @entity36 irishman @entity8 @entity11 shows off his awesome power off the tee with another brutal drive at @entity40 @entity11 stands 6ft 4in and is such a naturally talented athlete he had every sporting coach at his college clamouring for him to specialise in their particular pursuit			1
when he started making millions from golf , it was hardly surprising that temptation lay at every turn			2
only @entity50 attracted more swooning women than @entity11 , but only @entity50 was wise enough to pick his way through the pitfalls			1
and now @entity11 ’s back			1
will this turn out like another @entity55 fable , where he returns but only to fall back into his old ways as quick as a lead can disappear on a pressure - filled sunday ? happily , all the signs point the other way			1
during the break , his fiancee @entity60 — whose ice hockey - playing father @entity62 holds the same revered status in @entity66 that @entity67 holds in @entity68 — gave birth to their first child			2
when @entity11 starting practising ahead of his return , his coach @entity72 could n’t believe the difference mentally			1
@entity11 's happy family life with @entity60 ( left ) could spell trouble for @entity8 ( right ) on the course @entity11 's form has been stunning since he became a father			1
@entity60 gave birth to son , @entity81 , in january @entity60 and @entity11 share a kiss , while @entity81 watches , after his victory in @entity84 on sunday it ’s showing on the golf course			1
@entity87 , he ’s only played five events following that long break and he ’s already had two second - place finishes and , on sunday , a classy win in the @entity31 at @entity40			1
how ’s that for talent ? it was all on show on the 18th hole on sunday			2
the water hazard that juts out at 300 yards to the edge of the fairway and caught even @entity8 ’s drive ? @entity11 cleared it comfortably			1
@entity8 hit a three - iron for his third shot ; @entity11 had an eight - iron			1
it was the eighth consecutive season in which @entity11 has managed at least one victory			2
the next best sequence on the @entity106 is @entity107 ’s five			0
@entity11 was handed the @entity108 by @entity109 after his victory at the weekend @entity11 pictured putting on the sixth hole during his final round in @entity113 on sunday @entity11 insists that his six - month absence from golf was not down to a failed drugs test just like the @entity118 , his game is built on devastating power and accuracy from the tee			1
now 30 , he has given @entity8 an enormous head start			0
imagine the pair coming down the stretch at a major with one man having four @entity126 wins to draw upon while the other is still awaiting his first ? but if you ’re looking for the player who ought to run @entity8 the closest over the next few years , @entity11 has the game			2
and now — finally — it looks like he might also have the brain			0
‘ i can hardly believe i ’ve played a tournament without a single bogey			0
i did n’t think it was possible on this course			0
’ it was a good job it was possible for the impressive @entity140 @entity139 , for it ’s about the only way any of the women can beat 17 - year - old @entity144 these days			2
@entity139 ( left ) won the women 's championship trophy in @entity146 by two shots over @entity144 @entity148 ( second right ) won the tournament by not firing a single bogey across the four rounds @entity153 , wh became golf 's youngest - ever world no 1 last month , finished the event in second place even so , 26 - year - old @entity148 still only won the @entity158 tournament in @entity146 by two shots from the @entity160 , who has two wins and now this second place to her name since becoming golf ’s youngest - ever world no 1 last month			1
sections of the @entity14 press are wondering why @entity8 was given a largely free pass for tossing his three - iron into the water last week while the criticism that would have followed @entity173 , if he ’d done it , ‘ would have blown up the internet ’			0
so let ’s see if we can explain the difference			0
at the age of 25 @entity178 never engaged with spectators , rarely signed autographs , was frequently seen spitting on the side of greens and treated the press with barely concealed contempt			0
@entity8 acknowledges the crowds , devotes hours of his time to signing autographs and spends way longer than he needs trying to give an insight to the media			0
reap what you sow , it ’s called			0
@entity14 media has queried if @entity173 would have got more stick than @entity8 for throwing a club away @entity8 threw his three - iron into the lake in @entity113 but a scuba diver later discovered it it is not known whether @entity3 ( right ) will compete at the masters at @entity200 next month as for whether @entity173 will be back for the masters next month there is , of course , no word			1
no update on his progress , nothing			0
to turn the question around : could you ever imagine @entity8 acting like that ? the only thing we can say with a degree of certainty is that friday is surely a big day if @entity3 is to turn up at @entity200			0
that ’s the deadline for entering the @entity218 next week — and if he does n’t play in that event , one he ’s won a remarkable eight times , it ’s hard to envisage him playing the masters .			0

@entity11 had a six - month leave of absence from golf
he *fiercely* *rejected* *rumours* it was because of a failed drugs test
he won the @entity31 in @entity113 on sunday
