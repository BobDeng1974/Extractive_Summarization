by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 12 october 2013 two girls will be forced to have the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine against their will after a @entity7 ruling			2
the children , aged 11 and 15 , were told it was ‘ in their best interests ’ to have the vaccine despite telling the court they did n’t want it			0
they were due to receive the injection yesterday but the procedure has been postponed due to ‘ practical difficulties ’ , according to the solicitor of the girls ’ mother			1
ruling : the children , aged 11 and 15 , were told it was ' in their best interests ' to have the vaccine despite telling the court they did n't want it the ruling came after their divorced parents disagreed over the children having the inoculation			2
it is only the third case of its kind in the @entity7			0
the girls ’ mother , named only as mrs f , does n’t want them to have the inoculation because she fears side effects			1
but their father has pushed for the girls to be protected against @entity39			1
the sisters , named in court documents as @entity42 and @entity43 , live with their mother			2
the ruling was revealed by @entity46 , which obtained the court papers			0
according to the @entity46 report , a court - appointed guardian was concerned that the girls had been ‘ strongly influenced ’ by their mother			1
the report said that the girls ’ father initially favoured his daughters not receiving the vaccination but changed his mind after the measles epidemic in @entity58 earlier this year			1
in evidence given to the @entity7 , the girls ’ mother said : ‘ parents have a choice to do what they feel in their hearts they really believe			1
i feel both children have grown up in a frame of mind which they were settled in and supported in the same outlook and are now forced to take a different view without more positive reassurance and the recording of ingredients [ of the vaccine ] is unsatisfactory			0
they have a right to be informed			0
’ concern : the girls ' mother , named only as mrs f , does n't want them to have the inoculation because she fears side effects however mrs @entity83 said the girls felt obliged to agree with their mother and are not able to form an opinion on their health independently			1
she said ‘ weight should be attached to the wishes of mature children , ’ but in this ‘ unfortunate ’ case the children could not decide for themselves			0
the couple , who married in 1996 and divorced in 2011 , agreed their daughter l would be inoculated as a baby but changed their mind and agreed she should not have a booster jab			2
they decided that @entity43 would not be vaccinated			0
solicitor @entity101 , representing the mother said the children had been brought up with the idea that ‘ if you are healthy , you eat properly , you have a good immune system , then it ’s not necessary to be vaccinated ’			2
she said the girls also believed the ‘ side effects can be harmful ’			1
asked if the two girls had been vaccinated , miss @entity101 said : ‘ no , there have been practical difficulties in forcing the order and that is , at the moment , an ongoing issue			0
’ @entity116 , of the @entity117 , said : ‘ in this case the judge decided that the views expressed by this 15 - year - old were n’t sufficiently balanced , were n’t sufficiently sensible and did n’t give sufficient weight to the positive side of the immunisation			0

girls ' mother does n't want them to have the jab because she fears side effects
but their father has pushed for the girls to be protected against @entity39
