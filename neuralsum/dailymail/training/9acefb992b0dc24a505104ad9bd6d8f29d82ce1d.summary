' he was not causing any trouble at all			0
whatever it was , one of the women would simply not leave him alone			0
' he was obviously trying to leave the scene as best he could			2
if she had simply let things go i very much doubt we would be where we are at court today			0
' you can be seen running towards him at quite a pace			0
you were clearly going to launch some kind of assault upon him			0
' when he turned his head , possibly having heard you running behind him , you hit him full in the face			2

' you are a young man of a big build and the blow was hard enough to break his nose in three places and knock him out			2
