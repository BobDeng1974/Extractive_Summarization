overnight , it has become a tourist sensation			0
and since it ’s attached to the most popular ticketed visitor attraction in @entity4 , the crowds are just going to keep on getting bigger — as , indeed , is this stupendous piece of art. for @entity8 , the acclaimed ceramic artist , has barely completed 15 per cent of his poppy invasion of the @entity10			1
ahead of yesterday ’s royal opening of the project , he had installed 120,000 hand - made flowers			1
these are stunning enough as it is , filling one side of the @entity10 ’s mighty moat with cascading ripples of red			0
that is one for each of the @entity4 and @entity25 soldiers , sailors and airmen who perished in the @entity26			1
by then , all four sides of @entity53 ’s great fortress will be surrounded by a sea of scarlet ( raising millions for charity in the process )			1
by then , too , the capital will have grown rather attached to a powerful little event which began yesterday and will take place every nightfall between now and @entity45			2
as dusk falls , the names of 180 war dead — each one nominated by families and members of the public — will be read out			0
a different speaker will be invited each night , standing amid the poppies on the same grassy mound where new @entity73 recruits were sworn in during the war			2
video courtesy of @entity76 poppy appeal : artist @entity8 planned the project for 888,246 ceramic flowers to be planted at the @entity10 and all will be sold to raise millions for charity precision : @entity83 is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp , much like a large biscuit cutter , carves out petal patterns and are paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals @entity91 crafted : this is one of the 35 artists who hand made the beautiful poppies now being planted at the @entity10 process : the leaves of the poppy were cut from clay using a stamp and later the red glaze was added and baked on in a kiln last night it was the actor @entity103			1
with echoes of the nightly bugle call at the @entity107 in @entity108 — a profoundly moving ritual which draws ever - larger crowds — the scheme has already been inundated with online nominations			1
once informed that an ancestor will be on the list on a given evening , entire families are expected to attend			0
‘ our biggest challenge is the sheer scale of the thing , ’ says the @entity10 ’s head of operations and deputy governor , @entity118			0
a former colonel in the @entity123 , he is used to big projects ( he handled the military logistics for the last royal wedding )			0
this idea represents a fusion of two notable @entity4 talents : creative flair and military planning			1
each week between now and november , 55,000 of these poppies must be manufactured before being assembled and planted by an army of volunteers			1
@entity8 was supported by trainee ceramicists from @entity136 in @entity137 using clay provided by @entity139 , also on @entity140			1
video courtesy of @entity76 powerful : @entity10 was turned blood red and the shadows of men walking to war were shown in a moving ceremony grand opening : @entity103 at the unveiling of the @entity150 artwork by @entity8 where images were beamed onto the @entity10 yesterday evening solo : a lone trumpeter plays under a spotlight at dusk surrounded by the ceramic poppies in a moving ceremony on the @entity158 yesterday col @entity118 has been astonished by the numbers queuing to help			1
some 8,000 volunteers have signed up , including a group of @entity162 living in @entity163 - upon - @entity158 and a lady who flew from @entity165 to take part			2
since the project is in the @entity10 ’s public precincts and free of charge — with free on - site wi - fi to explain it all — the crowds have already caught on			1
yesterday , i found plenty of @entity73 suits among the t - shirt - and - shorts brigade lining the walkways overlooking the site as it was opened by the @entity34 and @entity35 and prince @entity36 , accompanied by @entity32 , former head of the @entity178 and now @entity33			1
at the @entity10 ’s north - west corner , a great shower of poppies pours forth from a window in @entity183 , a bastion named after the founder of the @entity186			1
it ’s actually a @entity188 ’s kitchen window ( a distinguished old soldier , he is , by all accounts , thrilled to be involved )			2
royal approval : the @entity34 and @entity35 and @entity36 unveiled @entity192 in @entity193 , telling the artist they thought it was incredible production line : after being cut out circular petals are placed on top of eachother before they are crimped together by hand at mr @entity8 ' @entity202 workshop things of beauty : the ceramic flowers will be at the @entity10 for several more months before being sent to the homes of those who have bought them for £ 25 process : the petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position			1
the bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing installations : the parts designed to swoop through windows , over walls and along the ground were created in @entity224 before being brought to @entity193 at the south - west corner , a great wave of poppies is surging over the causeway through which three million tourists enter the @entity10 each year			2
the broad layout of the poppies has all been planned by theatrical designer @entity232 of the @entity233			0
‘ as a military man , i obviously have the temptation to make it all look very neat and tidy but that would look like a cemetery , ’ says col @entity118			0
‘ the whole idea is to let it flow			0
this is a dynamic thing which will grow and grow and then , suddenly , go away			0
’ for this is not a garden of remembrance			0
rather , it is a piece of art to encourage reflection rather than solemnity — and to raise funds for a broad range of forces ’ charities			2
members of the public can buy one of these poppies — each the size of a grapefruit , hand - sculpted and fixed to a 2ft metal stalk — for £ 25			2
after november 11 , each one will be removed from the moat , washed and sent to its owner with a certificate			1
months of work : the poppies are still being planted across the @entity10 and the full display will not be completed until @entity45 this year work of art : each poppy takes three days of work to complete and the 888,000 needed are not yet finished design : as well as using ceramic poppies , its creators used the @entity10 and its grounds to form part of the artwork determined to contribute something to the centenary of the outbreak of the @entity26 , @entity8 only put his idea to the @entity10 ’s custodians , @entity76 , last october			1
the trustees then created a community investment company to handle poppy sales			0
production costs , which include two firings of every clay poppy petal , are not cheap ( and could touch £ 8 million )			0
but 10 per cent of every poppy sold goes straight to charities including @entity285 , the @entity286 and @entity287			1
and once all the costs are covered , the entire surplus will be distributed			0
with a potential income of £ 22.2 million , it could be a very substantial sum			0
this is a remarkable and highly original addition to @entity4 ’s commemorative landscape			2
it is also a temporary one			0
catch it while you can			0
charities you will support : confederation of @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity287 , the @entity286 , @entity304 ( soldiers , @entity305 ) and @entity285 .			0

ceramic poppies representing every soldier from @entity4 and @entity309 killed will be planted by november 11
artist @entity8 was *inspired* by the *battlefield* accounts of an *unknown* soldier who died in @entity108
@entity34 and @entity35 and prince @entity36 unveiled the project yesterday and planted own poppies
all flowers are to be sold off - raising millions to be split between six charities with links to armed forces
every poppy being *handmade* by team of at least 35 *people* and each takes around three days to create
