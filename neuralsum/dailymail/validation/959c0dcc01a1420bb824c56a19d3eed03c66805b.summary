@entity0 , laughing while attempting to hit the high notes as an amusing singer covers @entity17 's @entity16 , is no doubt referring to the picturesque @entity19 on @entity20 at which he 's clearly enjoying himself			2

' ' i 'm actually out of the @entity53 series , the back wo n't hold up for that format at this point in time , but i have n't retired from any format as yet			2
