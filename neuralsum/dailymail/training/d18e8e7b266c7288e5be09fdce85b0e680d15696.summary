by @entity0 a mother who took her son to @entity3 during term - time to say goodbye to his dying grandfather has landed herself a criminal record			1
@entity6 , 35 , pleaded guilty to a truancy charge when she appeared at @entity8 ’ court , @entity9			1
she had taken son @entity10 , 13 , on a ten - day break , which was the dying wish of her father - in - law @entity12			1
he had pancreatic cancer and died three months later			1
@entity6 , centre , with her mother , @entity16 and her children , @entity10 , 13 , behind her and @entity18 , five , and @entity19 , three sitting on her knees			1
she was hauled to court after the family went on holiday to @entity3 during term time with terminally ill grandfather @entity12 ms @entity6 said she had asked @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity9 , for permission to take her teenage son @entity10 out of class for the trip but the request was refused because it was not ‘ an exceptional circumstance ’			1
this week , she appeared at @entity8 ’ court where she was given a six - month conditional discharge and ordered to pay a £ 15 victim surcharge after pleading guilty to failing to send a child to school			1
she had wanted to plead not guilty but was told the only defences available to her were that the headteacher had authorised the absence ; sickness covered by medical evidence ; religious observance ; or failure by the local authority to provide transport			2
as none of these applied to her situation ms @entity6 pleaded guilty , but explained to magistrates why she had taken her child out of school			1
@entity12 died of pancreatic cancer three months after the family holiday in @entity3 ms @entity6 , who has two other sons @entity18 , five , and @entity19 , three , told the court she went ahead with the holiday , which was being paid for by @entity10 ’ grandparents , as she wanted to fulfil mr @entity12 ’s wish of a last family break			1
in court she said : ' it was his last holiday with his grandchildren			0
' i feel it ’s an exceptional circumstance , because of the memories and photographs we ’ve got from this holiday			1
' but on her return , the part - time support worker , who is sole carer for her three sons , was issued with a £ 120 fine			1
parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated			2
they have to ask permission from the headteacher if they want to take their children out of school during term time			2
but it can only be done if an application is made to the headteacher in advance or if it is in ' exceptional circumstances '			2
it is down to the headteacher to decide whether they then allow the pupil to take time off			0
various options are available to headteachers , social workers or police including issuing parents with penalty notices between £ 60 and £ 120 if parents have not taken action or asked for help			0
if this is not paid , a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £ 2,500 , a three - month jail term or a community sentence			1
the paperwork was sent to her old address , and because she had not been able to pay the fixed penalty she was forced to appear in court			0
she told magistrates that the holiday had initially been planned for the @entity114 holidays , but mr @entity12 was taken ill and had to undergo a course of chemotherapy , which meant that the holiday had to be postponed until september			0
she said she had approached the school , but had been told by the headteacher , @entity119 , that it was not in his power to grant the leave			0
speaking after the hearing , she said she would now have a criminal record for the next six months until it was spent			2
' it ’s upsetting because i ’ve never been in trouble with the police in my life , ' she said			0
' i do n’t see why i should have something on my record , no matter how small			0
' i understand i broke the law , but if the headteacher does n’t think a grandparent dying is an exceptional circumstance then i do n’t know what is			1
' i think it ’s disgusting			0
as soon as we came back from holiday he was more or less in the hospice			0
@entity6 said she had asked @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity9 , for permission to take her son @entity10 out of class for the trip but the request was refused because it was not ' an exceptional circumstance ' @entity6 took her son @entity10 , 13 , out of @entity25 , pictured , for a ten - day break during term time ' the kids talk about that holiday every single week			1
his last wish has been granted , and they ’ll always remember their grandad			0
it ’s just a shame it ’s ended like this			0
' mr @entity119 said : ' we do n’t think it ’s appropriate to discuss the details of this individual case			0
' the government ’s guidelines on absence during term time changed in september last year			2
' head teachers should only authorise a leave of absence in exceptional circumstances			0
' these are only considered if no other option is possible and an absence from school is necessary during the term			2

@entity6 took son out of school to say goodbye to dying grandfather
@entity25 had refused request as it was not ' an exceptional circumstance '
ms @entity6 , 35 , and son @entity10 , 13 , from @entity9 , went on ten - day , term - time break to @entity3
