there were only 27,099 supporters there to see it but @entity5 's lowest crowd of the season watched them give one of their most ruthless displays , beating @entity10 's bottom club @entity9 in the @entity11			1
jeers for @entity13 and cheers for @entity15 echoed around the 98,000 - capacity arena early in the first half			2
the coach is still battling to save his job and he picked his strongest possible side with @entity15 , @entity21 and @entity22 reunited up front - all three scored in the first half to all but put @entity5 in the quarter - finals where they will face thee winner of the @entity28 derby between @entity29 and @entity30 after the formality of next week 's second leg			1
many @entity5 supporters were left asking why tinkerman @entity13 had rested @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity21 and @entity15 in the previous sunday 's difficult trip to @entity38 to then play them all against lowly @entity9 who are currently the worst side in @entity41 football			1
@entity5 got back to winning ways against @entity9 on thursday evening after their disappointing defeat to @entity38 @entity44 forward @entity21 opens the scoring for @entity5 in the first leg of their @entity11 last - 16 clash against @entity9 former @entity48 forward @entity22 scores his side 's second goal of the evening at the @entity51 @entity52 star @entity15 scores his side 's third goal from the penalty spot on the stroke of half - time @entity15 blows kisses to the crowd after scoring a penalty , which was won by team - mate @entity21 , for @entity5 @entity62 international @entity61 celebrates after scoring @entity5 's fourth goal against @entity10 strugglers @entity9 @entity5 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity64 ; @entity35 , @entity34 ( @entity65 75 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 60 ) , @entity68 ; @entity69 , @entity36 , @entity70 ; @entity15 , @entity22 , @entity21 ( @entity71 66 )			1

booked : @entity22 , @entity95 , @entity82			0
referee : @entity97 att : 27,099 @entity22 looked especially inspired , assisting the first and scoring the second , meaning he now has goals in all three competitions for the club he joined this summer			2
@entity5 were both unlucky and wasteful in the first half hour			0
@entity21 should have been awarded a penalty when he was bounced off the ball by @entity106 but the referee waved away the appeals			0
then a perfect lofted pass from @entity15 dropped into @entity21 's path			2
the @entity44 should have scored without breaking stride but he sent his shot wide			0
@entity21 was all flicks and tricks against @entity9 's five - man defence and on 35 minutes he was given another chance and this time he did n't miss , hammering home @entity22 's slide - rule pass across the face of the six - yard box			1
@entity22 could have opened his account on 38 minutes but his lob was finger - tipped away by @entity9 keeper @entity77			2
the former @entity48 striker was working hard though and he created an opening for himself just before half - time before drilling home the @entity5 second			0
@entity21 was then tripped on the stroke of half - time and @entity15 scored the penalty , before blowing a kiss to supporters who were making it clear who they backed in the power struggle between coach and star player			1
@entity22 was involved again 10 minutes into the second half , passing to @entity15 who threaded a pass through @entity9 's defence to @entity61 , who made it 4 - 0			1
and it was five when @entity21 rifled in right - footed from the edge of the area			0
the @entity44 was kicked by @entity106 and taken off as a precaution but it 's a measure of @entity13 's popularity - low at the moment that his decision to bring on @entity71 was booed by many fans			1
@entity71 was put through by @entity22 and should really have played the return pass but went for the lob instead and was wide with his finish			0
@entity22 did little to hide his disgust			0
he at least had his fourth goal in a @entity5 shirt and the team had reminded everyone what they are capable of			0
