but what was once viewed as something of a punishment may become a culinary treat if @entity12 's new menu is anything to go by			1
the chef from a tiny beachside village near @entity16 in @entity17 has created a new menu based on his life - long obsession with the ocean			1
his main ingredient ? @entity23			0
would you eat this ? a chef ( r ) from @entity17 has introduced a new 21 - course tasting menu using plankton ( @entity29 ) as the main ingredient while plankton is most commonly known as a mealtime treat for fish and whales , @entity12 has created a 21 course tasting menu based on the sea - based bacteria , which he is serving up at his @entity38 - starred restaurant for a tasty 105 euros			1
unsurprisingly , plankton is n't recommended for human consumption and even @entity12 has made himself sick when cooking with it in the past			1
speaking to @entity43 about his bizarre culinary experiment , he said : ' ever since i started cooking , plankton has been on my mind and it has always been a challenge to recreate its flavors for my dishes			2
' the self - proclaimed ' @entity51 ' teamed up with scientist @entity52 back in 2007 to begin cultivating plankton			2
experimentation : the self - proclaimed ' chef of the sea ' believes that plankton have a vital role in the food chain and make the fish that eat it tastier			0
( r ) an example of one of his quirky seafood dishes @entity12 reveals that the secret to culinary success is to keep the alga lyophilized ( freeze - dried ) and then bound with sterilized sea water just before served to keep it fresh			2
@entity23 are any organisms that live in the sea and ca n't swim against a current they are a vital food source for fish and whales these organisms include drifting animals , archaea , algae , or bacteria many plankton are microscopic in size but some are as large as jellyfish one of his new signature dishes is @entity89 - a recreation of oyster and lemon but his quirky interpretation replaces the oyster with plankton			1
@entity12 's experimentation 's with plankton have led him to champion its role in the food chain because he believes fish that eat plankton have a fuller flavour			2
feeding fish with plankton also puts less pressure on the environment			0
and @entity12 is n't stopping at just plankton			1
the adventurous chef is determined to open our tastebuds to a new variety of fish , including species that are usually thrown back into the ocean called ' bycatch			0
' he added : ' i ’ve always been obsessed by the sea and i have been on many different kinds of fishing boats			0
' it was on one of them that i was struck by the amount of fish that were thrown into the sea for not having a trade name , which led me to start working to bring these poor " no - name " fish to haute cuisine			0
