one million @entity1 children classed as healthy by the government 's official statistics are dangerously unfit , according to shocking new research			1
academics warn that an epidemic of inactivity means many slim - looking children have ' hidden ' fat which puts them at risk of an early death from type 2 diabetes or heart disease			1
they warn that a national schools strategy to monitor children 's health is failing to identify many of those at risk because it does not officially class them as overweight			1
but the latest research , using a more accurate method to measure actual body fat , indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs			1
it provides mounting evidence that @entity1 is facing a childhood obesity crisis - and suggests the @entity45 legacy of 2012 is failing to create healthier and more active young people			0
the scientists have described a generation of ' @entity50 ' kids - who are ' thin on the outside , @entity51 '			1
they say as many as one in seven children recorded by schools as having a healthy @entity31 are at risk of developing life - limiting diseases			1
last night , after being confronted with the research , public health minister @entity57 admitted @entity31 ' is n't a perfect measure '			2
but despite the evidence , officials say there are no plans to change the system			0
child obesity expert professor @entity65 , of @entity67 , who led the research , said the number of unfit youngsters had been ' clearly underestimated '			0
research indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs he added : ' there 's a raft of children who have been overlooked because they have a “ healthy ” @entity31			1
this matters because the more fat you have , compared to muscle , the more likely you are to develop type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease in later life			2
if they maintain that body composition into adulthood , or it gets worse , they are going to be at high risk of these diseases			2
' the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , introduced in 2006 , records children 's height and weight at ages four to five , and again when they are ten and 11			0
these measurements produce a @entity31 for each child , which indicates whether they are within a healthy range or not			1
however , @entity31 is known to be poor at distinguishing between overweight children and those who are naturally muscular			1
as a result of the programme , parents have received official letters warning them that their sporty , active children are overweight			0
in the unpublished study of more than 1,000 children , prof @entity65 used a @entity107 ' bio-electrical impedance ' machine that passes a low electrical current through the body to determine how much weight is fat and how much is muscle			2
the research found 15 per cent of those classed as having a healthy @entity31 carried high levels of fat , but low levels of muscle			1
one eight - year - old boy recorded a healthy @entity31 of 17.7 but was found to have 23 per cent body fat and low muscle mass. another boy , aged nine , had a healthy @entity31 of 19 but carried more than 28 per cent body fat , making him technically obese - despite not appearing overweight			1
meanwhile , the study found one in ten children labelled overweight using @entity31 were healthy - equivalent to 300,000 children nationwide			1
prof @entity65 said : ' many children find playing on the computer more enjoyable than hopscotch or tag , as they did 40 years ago			0
i think we have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity habits early in life			0
' @entity135 , of the @entity136 , said : ' the @entity90 is not producing a true and accurate picture of obesity in this country			0
we need to see inside children with sophisticated scientific equipment to find hidden fat - otherwise we are failing to address a growing problem			1
' there should be a scanning unit visiting schools , and children should be measured annually			0
we 're making decisions on how to combat obesity based on inadequate information			0
' child fitness expert dr @entity151 , at @entity152 , said : ' the least fit and healthy children in our studies are the ones who are underweight , not the overweight ones			2
prof @entity65 thinks we have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity habits @entity31 is n't related to health at all - it 's a height - to - weight ratio - and because it 's so insensitive it 's not fit for purpose			1
i ca n't think of a worse way to measure children 's health			0
' childhood obesity is known to be a growing problem in the @entity1 which has been blamed on poor diet and lack of exercise			0
once established , it is hard to treat - making early intervention more crucial			0
overweight children are more likely to become obese adults and therefore have a higher risk of premature death , disability and long - term health problems			1
most of the serious consequences will not develop until adulthood			0
the @entity90 is administered by @entity187			0
dr @entity188 , director of children , young people and families , said : ' we have to look at the totality of evidence , which concludes the @entity195 is the most suitable indicator of body fat and overall weight in childhood			2
' minister @entity57 said : ' we know @entity31 is n't a perfect measure but it is recognised internationally as the most reliable way to estimate body mass. it is recommended by the @entity204			2
' there is still much to do and we are clear that families need a balanced diet and regular exercise to be healthy			0
