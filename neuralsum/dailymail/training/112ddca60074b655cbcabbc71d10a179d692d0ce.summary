by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 23:36 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 23:38 est , 19 april 2013 federal law enforcement is not adequately prepared for a coordinated terror attack in multiple cities , or for an armed , hostage - taking siege at a public place where people congregate			0
that assessment comes from a @entity10 veteran who led the agency 's top anti-bombing office for eight years , spanning two presidencies			1
@entity14 helped found @entity15 , and led it from december 2003 through july 2011			1
he told @entity16 that the april 15 @entity17 will wake up some counter-terrorism analysts to how much more horrible the situation could have been if an enemy were better organized			0
' yes , it was the @entity22			0
we 're just lucky it was n't the @entity22 and four other cities at the same time , ' @entity14 said			1
@entity14 ( @entity26 ) led @entity10 's @entity27 from 2003 to 2011			1
he warns that backpack - bombers in several cities at once could be more than @entity30 is ready to handle @entity32 teams like this one in @entity33 , @entity34 , have received specialized training from the @entity15 , along with funds for tactical equipment			0
the @entity39 administration has removed nearly half of that funding the @entity42 , which he used to lead , has spread funds around for training , equipment and inter-agency coordination			1
but as @entity16 reported , the @entity39 administration has cut 45 per cent from its budget , taking dollars away from bomb squads , swat teams , @entity51 handlers and dive teams at the state and local level			1
that decision should be reversed , he said			0
' look how tragic a situation this is			0
imagine the complexity if this had happened simultaneously that day in a number of cities			0
' @entity14 explained in a telephone interview that during his more than seven years at the top of @entity10 's anti-bombing office , a scenario like the one @entity63 and @entity64 put @entity65 through was his most frequent fear			1
only local policing , he said , could prevent it			0
but without federal dollars for training , the local authorities generally did n't know how			0
crowds cheered after authorities captured bombing suspect @entity64 , but @entity14 warns that smarter bombers with a multi-city footprint would n't give anyone a happy ending ' during my time in office , people would ask me , " when is it going to happen ? when is it coming here ? " he said			1
' bombs are a threat			0
it 's going to happen			2
it 's happened already , ' he recalled responding , making reference to the 1995 @entity92 bombing , the first @entity94 attack in 1993 , and the 1996 @entity96 bombing in @entity97 , @entity98			2
' and once one happens , it 's going to keep happening			1
' @entity14 's worst nightmare , however , was a scenario that no one it set up to confront			1
' imagine @entity105 , ' he said , referring to a popular shopping center in @entity1 's @entity108 suburbs			2
' there 's @entity111 everywhere , it 's locked down , hostages are zip - tied in the middle of the place and they 're killing one every hour , ' @entity14 imagined			1
' how many jurisdictions are prepared to handle that operationally ? that 's what kept me up at night			2
' president @entity39 said friday night that @entity30 ' owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement professionals			1
' but his administration has slashed the budget of the office tasked with helping police prevent attacks like the @entity22 bombings in a january 2013 hostage crisis in @entity132 , armed robbers held 14 people but later fled the scene after stabbing one hostage and sexually assaulting another			1
in a terror - motivated hostage scenario , however , escape might not be on the hostage - takers ' minds - making specialized @entity32 training the only thing that could keep the hostages alive so @entity14 worked to equip and train state troopers , sheriffs and local police forces in the practical , tactical operations that the big , lumbering federal law enforcement agencies ca n't perform everywhere at once			2
the federal government 's @entity147 , he observed , are investigative agencies , while local law enforcement tends to directly handle the worst imaginable crises when they happen			2
this is especially true in rural areas , where the nearest federal agent could be a 10 - hour drive away			0
the @entity147 system , @entity14 said , is an example of how federal agencies can pull together toward a critical national goal , provided that there 's a well - funded apparatus to organize and lead them			1
' what you see happening right now with the @entity147 working , and state and local authorities working together , ' he explained , ' is proof positive that there has been a lot of good work done since 9/11			0
it 's clearly paid off			0
' the @entity169 manages 100 @entity147 , combing regional assets of nearly 3 dozen federal agencies near every @entity169 field office			0
@entity14 says they 're a good example of how cooperation can foil bombers and other terrorists			2

@entity14 says that ' once one happens , it 's going to keep happening '
he led top anti-bombing office for more than seven years
@entity39 administration cut office 's budget by 45 per cent
