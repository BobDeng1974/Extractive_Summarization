cool again ? a fashion model poses with an e-cigarette , which have now been banned from a string of pubs , restaurants , coffee chains and hotels e-cigarette users face widespread bans on the devices in pubs , restaurants and coffee chains			1
@entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity17 's pubs and @entity18 have joined public transport companies and airlines in banning the use of e-cigarettes in their branches			0
it comes after a widely criticised @entity26 report this summer which bans on indoor use , advertising and sales to minors			1
uptake of e-cigarettes , which use battery - powered cartridges to produce a nicotine - laced vapour , has rocketed in the past two years , but there is fierce debate about their potential risks and benefits			2
because they are new , there 's little scientific evidence on their safety			0
some experts fear they could be a gateway to tobacco smoking , while others say they have potential to help millions of smokers kick the habit			1
but there 's little patience for solid scientific findings			2
the @entity55 , the @entity56 , the @entity57 and the @entity58 have all banned e-cigarettes , @entity54 reports			0
' the bans are shortsighted , ' said @entity61 , chairman of the @entity62 and co-founder of e-cigarette company @entity64			2
' the vapour release from electronic cigarettes is not harmful to bystanders ... this will alienate customers who use electronic cigarettes			0
' while regular cigarettes release deadly carcinogens and toxins along with their nicotine payload , and kill more than 6million people a year , e-cigarettes are said to be significantly less harmful			0
but in august the @entity26 , the @entity78 health body , commissioned a review of e-cigarettes calling for stiff regulation on their use similar to that applied to normal tobacco products			1
a group of tobacco addiction experts who critiqued the report said the @entity26 's findings were riddled with errors , misinterpretations and misrepresentations , meaning policymakers may miss their potential health benefits			1
risks : because e-cigs are new , there 's little scientific evidence on their safety			0
some experts fear they could be a gateway to tobacco smoking , while others say they have potential to help millions kick the habit @entity108 , a researcher at the national addiction centre at @entity110 , said : ' i was shocked and surprised when i read it			1
i felt it was an inaccurate portrayal of the evidence on e-cigarettes			0
' @entity108 said that while e-cigarettes are relatively new and ' we certainly do n't yet have all the answers as to their long - term health impact ' , it is clear they are far safer than cigarettes			1
her co-author @entity122 of the tobacco dependence research unit at @entity124 , said it was vital that e-cigarettes should be assessed in relation to the known harms of tobacco cigarettes			0
' there are currently two products competing for smokers ' custom , ' he said			0
' one - the conventional cigarette - endangers users and bystanders and recruits new customers from among non-smoking children who try it			2
' the other - the e-cigarette - is orders of magnitude safer , poses no risk to bystanders , and generates negligible rates of regular use among non-smoking children who try it			0
' but the @entity147 said it supported bans , in line with its no - smoking policy			1
@entity151 , chairman of the @entity147 's board of science , told @entity54 : ' stronger controls are needed on where e-cigarettes can be used to protect others from exposure , to ensure their use does not undermine existing restrictions on smoke - free public places ... and to guarantee the use of e-cigarettes does not reinforce the normalcy of smoking behaviour			1

bans come after @entity78 health body advised curbs on indoor use and ads
addiction experts say the @entity26 findings are riddled with errors
@entity147 supports bans in line with no - smoking policy
