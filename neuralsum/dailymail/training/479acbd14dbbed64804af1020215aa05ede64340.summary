@entity0 has ordered @entity2 ’s supporters to stop taunting @entity3 with chants about the slip that wrecked @entity7 ’s title run last season			1
@entity2 fans still revel in the remarkable moment last april when @entity3 tumbled and allowed @entity0 ’s former striker @entity11 to blow open the title race			1
@entity0 has previously gone as far as saying the fall and the 2 - 0 @entity15 defeat directly handed the title to @entity17 — and @entity2 ’s fans have been ruthless since , chanting : ‘ @entity3 , @entity3 , he fell on his f * * * * * * a * * * , he gave it to @entity11			1
’ @entity11 ( left ) slots past @entity23 after @entity3 's slip at @entity15 at the end of last season a closer angle shows the mistake , which @entity0 said gifted @entity17 the @entity30 title that is sure to be heard again at @entity15 on tuesday when @entity2 face @entity7 in the first leg of their @entity34 semi-final			1
out of their last 16 @entity30 games , @entity2 play only four outside @entity36 — @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
@entity17 must go to @entity41 , @entity7 , @entity2 and @entity42 but @entity0 , who this season complained @entity44 was too quiet , insisted supporters need to cut @entity46 - bound @entity3 some slack			1
he said : ‘ he ’s a historic player for @entity7 , a historic player for the @entity30			2
he ’s an opponent i always admired and respected			0
there is a song that my fans have that i do n’t like at all			0
‘ a couple of times it ’s good fun but to go and go and go , especially when a player like him deserves respect , we do n’t need that			0
’ @entity0 ’s admiration for @entity3 is nothing new			1
even though the @entity63 is leading what may well be the most dynamic @entity2 side in the @entity30 era , he still has regrets over his failure to land the midfielder in 2005			2
those resurfaced after he watched his side produce a magnificent performance of speed and imagination to demolish @entity75			0
@entity7 captain @entity3 looks dejected as he walks back towards the centre circle after his mistake @entity2 manager @entity0 believes that @entity2 fans should stop singing about @entity3 's slip he said : ‘ i was dreaming of @entity83 , @entity3 and @entity84			1
we were playing in an open triangle without a no 10 , we were playing with @entity87 in front of the defenders and me and mr @entity90 and @entity91 were dreaming that			0
but the decision for me was proven right because he will be always a red forever			0
@entity3 ’s people were open to it and the feeling to join a top side like @entity2 , i think the feeling was there but to me personally he never said “ i will go ”			1
’ in words that might be interpreted as a dig at @entity84 , who has done so much this season to help @entity17 keep @entity2 in sight , @entity0 added : ‘ i love these quotes when he ( @entity3 ) was saying that in this life he would never score against @entity7			1
i understand why he was almost coming to @entity2 and he did n’t			0
’ there can not be much @entity0 feels he is lacking at the moment even if he said a quadruple was ‘ not possible ’			0
@entity2 led within 49 seconds against @entity75 and had four by the break			0
on saturday , @entity113 ( left ) and @entity114 ( centre ) masterminded @entity2 's 5 - 0 drubbing at @entity75 @entity0 's side now look ahead to a trip to @entity15 on tuesday night in the @entity34 semi-final @entity113 scored his 16th and 17th goals of a wonderful season , though the blitz came from deeper positions , with @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 and two - goal @entity114 surely the match of any midfield in @entity130			1
the speed of the blitz was neatly encapsulated by @entity75 ’s goalkeeper @entity133 , who said : ‘ compared with @entity17 , @entity2 look stronger — the midfield , their attacking force , is on a different level			2
they are so sharp , so quick and they try to surprise you			0
‘ after the last goal ( scored by @entity138 ) , i turned round to see what had happened and there were already three of their players celebrating in my six - yard box			0
i could n’t believe how quickly they were there			0
’ the debate over where this @entity2 side ranks against earlier versions is perfectly natural , though @entity0 insists trophies are the only true gauge			2
much will be learned this month with their two semi-final matches against @entity7 , as well as an @entity155 fourth - round tie with @entity156 and the huge league fixture against @entity17 .			1

@entity3 slipped to gift @entity2 an *important* goal last season
at the time , @entity0 said it directly handed @entity17 the title
now , @entity0 believes @entity2 fans should stop chanting about the fall
@entity2 face @entity7 on tuesday night in the @entity34 semi-final
