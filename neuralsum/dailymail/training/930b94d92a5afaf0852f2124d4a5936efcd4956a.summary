this past june he invited the @entity46 and @entity47 presidents for a day of peace prayers at the @entity8 , and before that agreed to requests to help facilitate talks between the @entity53 government and opponents			1
such @entity8 interventionism harks back to the papacy of @entity57 , who is credited with having helped bring down communism in his native @entity59 by encouraging the solidarity movement			0
@entity57 in 1978 also sent an envoy to help @entity1 ' native @entity62 and @entity63 reach a compromise on a territorial dispute			0
the two countries had been on the brink of war over the @entity69 and its islands			0
the @entity8 under @entity71 kept a low diplomatic profile , but during his 2012 visit to @entity2 , @entity73 voiced the @entity8 's long - standing position that it believed the @entity3 embargo was unjust and only hurt the most vulnerable on the island			1

' he did n't name the official			0
@entity1 ' top diplomat is @entity8 secretary of state cardinal @entity108 , until last year the @entity8 's ambassador to @entity111			2
