by @entity0 he succeeded where both @entity1 and @entity2 have so far failed by grabbing a first competitive goal of the season			1
and after coming off the bench to notch the killer second in an unconvincing 2 - 0 win at @entity10 on friday night , @entity6 vowed he is ready to step in for the injured @entity2 who limped off with a tight hamstring at @entity12 and will miss monday night ’s @entity14 clash with @entity16 ’s @entity15 at @entity17			1
‘ hopefully @entity2 is all right because he is a massive player for us , ’ said @entity6			1
‘ he also has great experience to give to the team			0
but if he is going to be out then it is a chance for me to come into the team and do well			1
looking up : @entity6 says he is ready to take lead for @entity24 after scoring against @entity10 in the 2 - 0 win ‘ and i was pleased with my performance when i got on			1
i felt i got in behind @entity10 , i turned their defence and in the end i grabbed a goal			1
’ however , @entity6 nearly found himself cast in the role of villain when , with the score still goalless , he headed a great chance from six yards straight at @entity10 keeper @entity35			1
after @entity36 put @entity24 ahead with a wickedly deflected shot , @entity6 made amends by applying the finishing touch to a shot from @entity41 that already looked net - bound			1
‘ i needed to do better with that header i missed , ’ nodded @entity6			1
‘ i just tried to go back across goal with it and their keeper has saved the ball			2
but luckily enough i ’ve got another chance and scored it			2
‘ @entity41 has n’t said anything to me about stealing his goal bonus ! i was n’t even sure his shot was going in			2
anyway it ’s my job as a striker to score goals and that ’s what i ’ve done tonight			0
i had to put the ball in the net			0
’ @entity57 : @entity6 netted the killer second against @entity10 and is hopeful of being called up to face @entity15 on monday @entity6 admitted @entity24 flattered to deceive for large spells			1
with a return to the @entity64 the ultimate goal , however , the former @entity61 striker says points are more valuable than performances			2
‘ it was a relief when the first goal went in , yes			2
i felt we huffed and puffed at the start of the match but the longer the game went on the more we came into it			0
‘ we created a few chances , and we maybe got a bit lucky with the first goal that went in via a deflection from @entity36			2
but getting three points is the most important thing			0
yes it would be nice to go out and play attractive , attacking football but teams come and stop you from doing that			0
so we will take it even if we have to win ugly			0
‘ i think it ’s going to be tough like this every week in the championship			0
there are teams like @entity90 and @entity91 - and @entity10 proved they are a very good side , too			1
so are @entity61 and @entity93			0
‘ it ’s a massive step up from @entity95 and two because there are only two or three teams who are n’t full time			0
we ’ve been used to playing part - time teams so the fitness levels of the opposition will be much higher			0
but that ’s something we will have to deal with			0
’ challenge : @entity6 says it is a ' massive step up from @entity95 and two ' and it will be tough for @entity24			1

@entity6 scores second killer goal in 2 - 0 win over @entity10 on friday night
' @entity111 is all right because he is a massive player for us , ' says @entity6 , ' but if he is going to be out then it is a chance for me '
