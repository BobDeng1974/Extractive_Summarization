a new £ 2 coin launched to commemorate the start of the @entity2 has been criticised for being too jingoisitc and glorifying war , after the @entity4 chose a design featuring an army recruitment poster			1
former war minister lord @entity7 is shown on the coin in military uniform pointing towards the viewer and saying ' your country needs you ' - an image which symbolised the early optimism of the war , which would claim almost a million @entity19 lives			1
but while the @entity4 described the image as ' powerful ' and ' instantly recognisable ' , sceptical users took to social media to accuse them of attempting a ' rebrand ' of the conflict			1
the coin is being produced by the @entity4 as part of a collection designed specifically for events in 2014			1
the former war minister , who is also associated with the use of concentration camps in the @entity41 , has proved a controversial decision with those who view the image of a red poppy as a more fitting tribute to the conflict			1
military figure : it has been suggested that lord @entity7 , shown here in full military uniform , was an inappropriate choice twitter user @entity53 wrote : ' just saw the @entity7 £ 2 coin			1
the official rebrand of @entity2 is apparently underway			2
it 's going to be wall - to - wall jingoism , is n't it ? ' , while @entity59 said : ' that 's not a sombre symbol of @entity62			0
should be a poppy or a soldier			0
' @entity65 added : ' shameful that the @entity4 are issuing a £ 2 coin in 2014 with a portrait of @entity7 , the man who gave the world concentration camps			1
' another said : ' new £ 2 coin glorifies ad campaign that led young men to needless death			2
' almost 2.5million men volunteered for lord @entity7 's ' @entity76 ' after a recruitment drive in 1914 and 1915 featuring the posters			1
but once the harsh realities of life on the front lines became clear , many of the young men who had volunteered for service felt betrayed by patriotic materials glorifying war to encourage them to sign up			0
@entity86 , director of the @entity87 , said the @entity7 coin would be the first in a series that will follow the progress of the @entity2 , amid centenary events over the next five years			1
he added : ‘ it ’s got a very familiar design , lord @entity7 pointing out from the face of the coin , as he did from the contemporary posters , asking people at the time to sign up for the @entity76			1
’ the @entity4 has been criticised for its choice of image , which it described as ' powerful ' and ' instantly recognisable '			0
imitative : the redesigned coin ( left ) features the mustachioed face of first world war recruitment ( right ) indeed , a page on the @entity4 's website , offering the coin , along with an information pack , for £ 10 suggests it could be used to ' honour someone in your family who played their part ' in the war			1
it explained : ' in 1914 lord @entity7 was appointed to mastermind a recruitment campaign that would go on to create one of the largest volunteer armies ever known in @entity19			1
' though many posters encouraged the men of @entity19 to enlist , the image of @entity7 himself has come to stand for the call to fight for @entity126 and country that saw men respond in their thousands			1
' perhaps you wish to honour someone in your family who played their part , or pay your respects as the nation remembers			0
maybe you have an interest in military history or want to learn more about such a significant time			0
you will want to secure one of these @entity140 £ 2 coins			0
' the @entity4 said that the image of @entity7 ' has come to stand for the call to fight for @entity126 and country ' , which is why it was judged worthy of its ' national theme ' by an advisory committee			1
a statement said : ' the @entity4 is one of the world ’s oldest and most venerable organisations , with an unbroken history of minting @entity19 coinage dating back over 1000 years			2
' [ the coin ] was selected to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the @entity2 because it has come to be so strongly associated with the outbreak of the war			1
' though many posters encouraged the men of @entity19 to enlist , the image of @entity7 himself has come to stand for the call to fight for @entity126 and country that saw men respond in their thousands			1
' the launch of every new coin must go through a rigorous planning and design selection process governed by an independent panel , known as the @entity167 ( @entity167 )			0
