as a busy tv host and a mother - of - three , @entity1 certainly has a lot on her plate , and now she has revealed the secrets to her success			1
in an interview with @entity9 for @entity10 , the 44 - year - old explains that it takes her less than an hour to get ready for her show , @entity13 , thanks to ' the tag team ' who have been doing her hair and make - up for 14 years			1
' they do hair and makeup at the same time that i 'm getting briefed , ' she said			2
' and my wardrobe is simple ; it 's just put out the night before			1
it 's so easy ; it 's a streamlined operation			1
and while she does try to break a sweat every day , the former @entity48 star says her rock - hard abs come naturally			1
' so much of it is genetic , ' she said in the interview			2
' i work out a lot , but the place i find i do n't really focus on is my stomach because i 've always sort of had a very strong core			1
' comes naturally : @entity1 ( pictured in january ) said her impressive abs are ' genetic , explaining : ' i work out a lot , but the place i find i do n't really focus on is my stomach because i 've always sort of had a very strong core ' hot couple : both @entity1 and her husband ( pictured doing the @entity64 ) are in great shape instead , she focuses on working out her arms and legs , which do require regular exercise to stay toned			1
' everybody has their thing , like their body part that 's good , and everybody has their body part that 's not so good , ' @entity1 explained			2
she added that she was born with a muscular physique , and that some people might find it ' objectionable '			0
' there are people that like a curvy physique			0
i 've never had a curvy physique and i will never have one			0
if i gained weight , i would just look like a larger more muscular version of myself ... that â€™s just the way i 'm built			0
' even so , @entity1 has revealed in the past that she has a penchant for high - intensity workouts like @entity92 , and she regularly trains with @entity94 's trainer and close friend @entity95			1
aging gracefully : @entity1 , who has three children with her husband of 18 years @entity44 ( right ) , is famously petite at just 5ft 3in , and her athletic physique seems only to get better with time she 's also an avid fan of @entity100 , a cardio dance training class run by her personal trainer @entity102			1
when it comes to diet , @entity1 makes an effort to eat healthily most of the time			0
' for the most part ... i eat a very clean diet , ' she says			0
' i have lots of vegetables , i eat protein , but i really do n't put a ton of thought into it			0
' to maintain a balanced diet , she stays active and avoids junk food - except for the occasional treat			2
the star revealed that she has a drawer in her home filled with candy for when @entity124 host @entity123 visits , since he apparently has a sweet tooth			0
' i 've been dipping into that a lot lately , ' she confessed			0
' i reward myself because he ; s on a book tour i guess ! '			0
