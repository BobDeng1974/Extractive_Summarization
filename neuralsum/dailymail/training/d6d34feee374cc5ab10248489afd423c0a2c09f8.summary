@entity1 1 - 0 @entity0 - click here to read @entity4 's match report from the @entity5 a glance at the tweets , forum postings and comments coming out of @entity10 would suggest that @entity11 still has more @entity0 fans for him than against			1
so the jury is split			0
to those who say @entity11 ran up the white flag in @entity1 , the case for the defence would point to the result			2
a 1 - 0 defeat , against @entity1 , @entity20 and all			1
pats on the back all round			0
whichever way you look at it , @entity11 ’s decision to ‘ rest ’ his best players for a @entity29 tie of huge importance was a brave one			2
only @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 survived from the 1 - 0 defeat to @entity51 at the weekend			1
@entity0 starting @entity52 v @entity51 : @entity46 , @entity40 , @entity47 , @entity53 , @entity48 , @entity54 , @entity49 , @entity39 , @entity42 , @entity55 , @entity56 @entity0 starting @entity52 v @entity1 : @entity46 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity47 , @entity48 ; can , @entity59 7 ; @entity60 , @entity49 , @entity61 ; @entity62 somehow @entity0 avoided a tonking , which justified the bizarre sight of @entity39 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity40 and @entity42 sitting on the bench at kick - off			1
after all there is still a trip to @entity69 to go and that is a banker win , surely ? now for the aftermath			0
hear that ? it is the cranking up of pressure on a manager who has publicly demonstrated that @entity77 is not his holy grail despite spending all of last season aiming for it			0
a glance ahead at the fixture list gives away @entity11 ’s thought processes , which centre round @entity84 and the weekend date at @entity85			2
there is a 12 - point gap between the @entity89 leaders and @entity0 in seventh place and @entity11 clearly wants to avoid it widening even further			1
yet by turning his attention to domestic matters , he threatens to undermine all that went on last season			0
@entity95 ( right ) celebrates scoring what proved to be the winning goal for @entity1 on tuesday @entity11 made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against @entity51 think back to a campaign in which @entity0 went on a 16 - match unbeaten run , carried on a tide of @entity104 and @entity105 goals and with the title a realistic objective			1
when the pressure got to the team and results went against them , the refrain from the @entity110 was ‘ get us back into the @entity29 ’			2
to the neutral , @entity0 is unique with its pre-match unfurling of flags and stage - managed by emotional rendition of @entity118			0
that atmosphere was shaped in @entity77 , back in the day when the @entity29 was just for champions			0
@entity121 launched a spectacular @entity123 attack on @entity11 for selecting a weakened line - up @entity0 's captain for the night @entity47 walks off at half - time holding his head with his side 1 - 0 down the hashtag # ynwa is synonymous with the club , which is why @entity11 will not be publicly condemned by the @entity85 faithful although there may be mutterings in private			1
if last season was the launch pad to the ‘ project ’ , then this campaign was supposed to be about @entity39 strutting his stuff on the @entity141 stage while @entity0 stayed in contention for domestic honours too			0
flawed genius @entity104 has gone , @entity105 is injury - prone and @entity56 is , well , @entity56 , so it does not take a genius to work out that @entity0 are not as good as they were last season			0
@entity11 applauds the travelling fans at full time after @entity0 's defeat by @entity1 @entity150 ' not bothered ' by selection criticism but if they want to continue to be recognised as a big club , rather than a club with a big history , then a giant step forward must be taken			1
what happens if @entity11 ’s rested players return only to lose to @entity84 ? what happens if @entity69 goes terribly wrong ? supporters will flip that question			1
beating @entity162 , reaching the knock - out stages of the @entity29 and @entity11 will look like a genius			1
he reacted petulantly to @entity121 ’s criticism on tuesday night by questioning the @entity168 pundit ’s managerial cv			2
at the same time , @entity11 cleverly plants a siege mentality into the minds of players and fans			0
only time will tell , who is right .			0

@entity11 *attracted* criticism for *fielding* a weakened team in @entity0 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity1 on tuesday night
@entity180 boss had one eye on *saturday* 's @entity89 clash with @entity84
@entity11 rested seven of his usual first - team starters at the @entity5
@entity29 last - 16 *qualification* still hangs in the balance
@entity0 are seventh in the @entity89 after a slow start
