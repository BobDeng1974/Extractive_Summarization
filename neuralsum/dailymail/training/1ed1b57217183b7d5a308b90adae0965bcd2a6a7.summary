@entity1 families and @entity2 last night condemned ‘ disgraceful incompetence ’ and @entity4 meddling for holding up the iraq war inquiry			1
@entity6 yesterday told @entity7 it will be ‘ some further months ’ before he can publish his report			1
launched six years ago , sir @entity6 ’s inquiry is expected to criticise dozens of senior figures			1
delay : launched six years ago , sir @entity6 's inquiry is expected to criticise dozens of senior figures the delay means voters will go to the polls in may without knowing the official verdict on one of @entity21 ’s most disastrous military ventures			1
@entity22 , whose 21 - year - old son @entity23 died in a massacre near @entity25 in 2003 , said the delay was disgraceful			1
‘ it is becoming the biggest cover - up of our generation , ’ he said			2
‘ we simply ca n’t understand it			0
’ @entity32 , a senior @entity33 , said : ‘ it ’s about the @entity4 protecting themselves			2
’ the country ’s top civil servant , cabinet secretary @entity34 , was also in the firing line for withholding key documents			1
in a personal attack , former foreign secretary @entity38 said : ‘ i have never known a cabinet secretary to have such a veto			2
frustrating hold - up : prime minister @entity7 said the report should have been published years ago former pm : @entity45 sources said dozens of the key players in the conflict , including @entity48 ( pictured meeting troops in @entity50 in may 2003 ) , are facing criticism in a document expected to run to a million words ‘ it seems to me that he has n’t had that independence of mind that is necessary			1
i can only say i am worried about it			0
’ as sir @entity6 faced calls to appear before mps to explain the delays : ' cover - up ' : @entity22 ( with wife @entity64 ) , whose son @entity23 ( in photo on wall ) , 21 , died in a massacre near @entity25 in 2003 , said the delay was disgraceful the inquiry was set up by then prime minister @entity71 in 2009 and took public evidence from its last witness in 2011			1
but publication has been held up by wrangling over the release of confidential messages and the so - called ‘ @entity81 ’ process by which people who are criticised in the report are given the chance to respond			1
in an exchange of letters yesterday , sir @entity6 explained to mr @entity7 that he would not be able to report before the may 7 general election			1
his admission came against a backdrop of increasing @entity88 anger over the delays , which were due to be addressed in a @entity91 debate next week			0
personal : cabinet secretary @entity34 ( left ) was attacked for withholding key documents , with former foreign secretary @entity38 ( right ) saying he had ' never known a cabinet secretary to have such a veto ' at prime minister ’s questions , the @entity95 , @entity97 mp sir @entity96 , attacked the @entity102 inquiry ’s ‘ disgraceful incompetence ’			1
sir @entity96 asked mr @entity7 : ‘ do you fully recognise the contrast in efficiency between the inquiries into the crimean war and the @entity110 campaign when compared to the disgraceful incompetence of the @entity102 inquiry into widely held suspicions that mr @entity48 conspired with president @entity114 several months before march of 2003 and then systematically sought to falsify the evidence on which that action was taken ? ’ mr @entity7 said the hold - up was extremely frustrating and the report should have been published years ago			1
mr @entity48 insisted he was not responsible for the delay , telling @entity120 : ‘ absolutely and emphatically , this is not to do with me , or as far as i ’m aware any other witness			1
‘ i ’ve as much interest as anybody in wanting to see the report published			2
’ he is understood to have received the final documents from the inquiry only a few days ago			2
sir @entity127 , chairman of the @entity91 foreign affairs committee , said there could be ‘ no justification whatsoever ’ for the process dragging on			2
he said sir @entity6 had been summoned before his committee to explain			2
here is an edited account of the exchange of letters between sir @entity6 and @entity7 : @entity138 wrote : dear prime minister , i last wrote to you in november 2013 , and to sir @entity34 in may 2014 , with an update on progress of the @entity144			1
my colleagues and i have made very substantial progress since my last letter			0
i can confirm that individuals are currently being given the opportunity to respond to provisional criticism of them in the @entity153 ’s draft report			1
that is an essential and confidential process			0
it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it in detail			0
we intend to finish our work as soon as it is possible to do so whilst being fair to all those involved			0
until we have received and evaluated responses from all those who have been given the opportunity to respond , i can not give an accurate estimate for how long it will then take to complete our work , but it is clear that will take some further months			0
i therefore see no realistic prospect of delivering our report to you before the general election in may 2015			0
our report will be based on a thorough and comprehensive account of the relevant events from 2001 - 2009			0
we are determined to fulfil the responsibility placed on us to identify lessons to be learned from the @entity21 ’s involvement in @entity50			2
in that context , i am pleased to record that since i last wrote the @entity153 has reached agreement with sir @entity34 on the publication of 29 of mr @entity48 ’s notes to president @entity114 , subject to a very small number of essential redaction , alongside the @entity153 ’s final report			1
agreement has also been reached on the detail of what material the @entity153 will publish in relation to records of conversations between mr @entity48 and president @entity114 , consistent with the principles agreed last era			1
yours sincerely , sir @entity6 @entity195 @entity7 replied : dear sir @entity6 , thank you for your letter of today			2
as you know , i would have liked to have seen your report published already and certainly well before the forthcoming election			0
the @entity201 , the lead up to it and its aftermath were hugely important events in this country ’s recent history			0
it is very important that your @entity153 sets out comprehensively for the @entity21 people what happened , and why , so that all the lessons can be learnt			0
however , it is important that the @entity153 remains fully independent of government and therefore the timetable and processes for completing your work are entirely for you to decide – not for the government			0
so i have to respect your decision			0
i hope very much that you will be able to [ submit the report ] shortly thereafter			0
had the previous government established this inquiry when i first called for it , we would not be in this position today			0
but that can not now be undone			0
