@entity0 is back playing her best tennis and trying to use the memory of @entity3 as an inspiration to maximise her potential			1
after storming through her final qualifying round of the @entity7 with a 48 - minute 6 - 1 6 - 1 victory over @entity10 ’s @entity9 yesterday morning @entity0 reflected on the loss of @entity3 , who was buried last monday after losing her battle against liver cancer			1
' it ’s so sad			2
you do n’t really believe it that you ’ll never see her again			2
her funeral was on my birthday and lots of the girls sent me messages			0
@entity25 ( @entity26 ) was there , @entity28 ( @entity29 ) was there , ' said @entity0 , who was already in @entity31			1
focused : @entity0 has said she is using the memory of @entity3 as inspiration to improve @entity34 missed : former @entity36 number one @entity3 died in may , aged 30 , due to liver cancer sad day : @entity3 was buried on monday at @entity38 in @entity39 , attended by friends and family ' i ’m just using it as motivation that life is short , you do n’t know when it ’s going to be your last so just make the most of every day			1
' @entity3 was so feisty on the court			1
i can picture her now saying , " come on "			0
i just ca n’t believe she ’s not here any more			0
' aside from that perspective , @entity0 is grateful that she is in a position to perform properly again , having endured a difficult 2013 which badly stalled her career after being diagnosed with glandular fever in march			1
eyes on the prize : @entity0 beat @entity10 ¿ s @entity9 to qualify for the first round of the @entity7 the contrast with where she was twelve months ago is striking , as she has now won eight matches in a row after taking the @entity64 title a week ago			1
her reward for making the main draw is a match against @entity68 of the @entity69 , the world number 66 , while her fellow qualifier @entity72 was given a very tough assignment , against seventeenth seed @entity74 of @entity76			0
' twelve months ago i really was n’t enjoying my tennis , ' said @entity0			1
' i was n’t feeling great			0
this was my first tournament back and i was n’t ready			0
' i had practised for three weeks after not playing for two and a half months and also i could n’t do too much fitness because i was n’t ready for that physically , it went into a downward spiral of not winning matches and losing confidence and i learned a lot from that			2
on the ball : @entity0 will face @entity68 in the first round at @entity7 ' for example i got injured again this year with my ribs and i really wanted to play @entity93 , it ’s one of my favourite tournaments of the year because my best friend lives there			1
' i thought to myself " you know what i ’m not ready " and i thought i ’d give myself that extra week to come back the next week , because coming back too soon is not the right decision			0
if i lose one week it will be better than losing months			2
' i was n’t winning much at all and now i ’m playing the best tennis of my career and i ’m loving it			0
i ’m not getting tired			0
i ’ve played so many matches in a row and i ’m taking nothing for granted			0
' i ’m just really enjoying , i ’m enjoying matches , practice , stretching after and the physio and all of it			0
' revitalised : @entity0 ( left ) has praised coach @entity110 ( right ) for her more attacking outlook on the court @entity0 has changed her playing philosophy in consultation with her new coach of this year , @entity116 @entity110 , taking on a far more attacking outlook			1
' before , even when i reached my highest ranking i was a kind of counter puncher on important points i ’d wait for my opponent to miss or hope for them to miss , now as soon as i see a short ball i want to win the point			2
