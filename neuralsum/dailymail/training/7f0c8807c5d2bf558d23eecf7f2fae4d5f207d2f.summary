this article was originally published in @entity2 @entity1 on saturday , august 23			1
@entity4 is a man i have known and liked for 16 years			1
to describe him as a personal friend would be stretching things but you take people as you find them			1
in football , players are quick to take umbrage at negative writeups but , in 20 years as a journalist , @entity4 remains the only one ever to utter a thank - you for a good one			1
exclusive : chief sports reporter @entity17 's broke the story in the @entity1 on thursday , august 21 @entity19 : how @entity20 broke the story of @entity4 and @entity23 's text message exchanges sorry : @entity4 issued a poorly - worded statement through the @entity25 in may , our professional acquaintance , stretching back to his days as a @entity29 defender , prompted an invitation to the annual @entity2 football writers ' awards dinner			1
@entity4 and his father could n't make it			1
if he had , some of those hammering him now would have been quick to shake his hand			1
there comes a time , of course , when you simply can not defend the indefensible			1
text messages of a gravely ill - judged , offensive nature have left @entity4 clinging to his personal and professional reputation			1
his career is on the line			2
people now ask openly if he can possibly hope to return to frontline management , while those of us who have always regarded him as a thoroughly decent man have a sense of unease over recent revelations			1
ten of the 12 shocking text messages exposed by this newspaper were sent by former @entity55 colleague @entity23			1
of 10,000 communications found on @entity23 's computer , @entity4 last night admitted sending three			1
and three is too many			2
one referred to ' fkn chinkys ' in relation to his @entity62 signing @entity63			2
it was crass and degrading			2
another concerned football agent , @entity66 , and was hurtful and anti-semitic in nature			2
success : @entity55 owner @entity69 celebrates @entity55 's @entity71 title victory with @entity4 in 2013 to a public who previously regarded him as a solid citizen , @entity4 is now tarnished			1
but the fact the texts are grossly at odds with his public persona make this a disturbingly sad story			2
in a bid to stem the loss of blood , the @entity25 issued a statement on @entity4 's behalf			1
' i 'm sorry ' might have sufficed but , instead , the texts were described by the usually slick @entity25 as ' friendly text - message banter '			1
a poorer choice of words is hard to imagine			2
it suggested a casual , almost complacent , approach to racism in @entity93 football			2
the @entity25 were , quite rightly , apologising for their apology			2
there is now a long line of critics setting their sights on @entity4			1
some branded him an ' abhorrent individual '			2
the vast majority of whom have never met him			2
out of the game : @entity23 ( left ) and @entity4 have both since left their jobs in football shock : @entity23 , @entity108 's director of football and @entity4 's former colleague , was also reported let 's be clear			1
there should n't be a person anywhere who thinks these texts deserve anything other than the deepest condemnation			2
the @entity117 's exchanges with @entity23 were at the extreme end of the scale , no question			1
they will plague him for the rest of his days			2
sacked last december , the former @entity29 defender 's first mistake was to become more popular than @entity55 owner @entity69			1
his second was to pursue him for compensation			2
@entity69 appeared to win that spat in may when @entity4 issued an ' unreserved apology ' for his role in his own sacking and dropped his compensation claim against the club			1
from there , the @entity135 hoped both parties could move on			2
but @entity69 is clearly not a man to either forgive or forget			0
read it here first ! how @entity20 broke the news over @entity4 's text shame mea culpa : @entity4 apologised live on @entity143 after @entity20 's revelations he appears to have held the worst of the texts back as a loaded gun			1
and he fired the bullet in a missive to the @entity150 the day before @entity4 planned to become the new manager of @entity108			1
but the problem for @entity4 is that @entity69 is beginning to look like a wronged party in all of this			1
like a reformed campaigner shining a light on the seedy underbelly of racism , sexism and homophobia in @entity93 football			0
a cynic might see him as something else			0
they may see a rich man with a grudge who is nursing a vengeful desire to settle old scores and get his way at any cost			0
a dangerous adversary hellbent on destroying @entity4 while taking @entity174 , the chief of the @entity25 , down as well			1
under fire : @entity174 , chief of the @entity25 , was criticised for his poorly worded aplogy if you were to chose an enemy , you certainly would n't start with @entity69			0
you would pay a penny for current @entity55 manager @entity180 's thoughts right now			1
you would pay substantially more for @entity4 's			1
he broke cover to offer up his apology			0
for the sake of his blameless young family and the people slighted by an ugly episode , it was the least he could do			0
@entity188 will tell if it was enough			0
tortured @entity190 's demise makes painful viewing the life of @entity193 has become a heart - rending tragedy			1
a slow moving train wreck increasingly likely to end in tears			0
to supporters of @entity204 , @entity198 , @entity199 — even @entity29 — the latest images on @entity201 of a once brilliant footballer are depressing , worrying and grim			0
clutching a bottle of gin , the former @entity199 international was captured , eyes half shut , face swollen , being led from his @entity211 home by police			0
in one picture , he sat head in hands , looking older than his 47 years			0
led away : @entity216 is escorted from his home by police to an ambulance some pictures require no caption			0
the bleak truth is that @entity190 is an alcoholic			0
he is ill. last september , when dry , he spoke in a television documentary of his fears that he might start drinking again			0
the fears proved depressingly well - founded			0
at the time , he spent his money on botox to counter the effects of the drinking and was spending £ 1,000 a year on cosmetic injections			0
this is how it goes			0
whatever @entity193 does , he does to extremes			0
at one point , football was his high of choice			0
at @entity198 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity204 , he was a mesmerising talent			0
the rights and wrongs of how @entity204 financed their signings during the @entity245 era are a source of lingering bitterness			0
but the sight of @entity193 in the @entity2 league added colour to a black and white scene			0
the problem was always going to come when the curtain fell and the floodlights dimmed			0
early promise : @entity193 in action for @entity198 against @entity256 in 1988 for a book on football 's flawed geniuses , his former manager , @entity257 , once told me : ' those of us who knew @entity193 thought it was always going to be a problem once they took away the focal point of his life — the football			1
' if he had been able to train for 16 to 18 hours a day , then come back the next day , he would have been happy			0
' that 's not how life works , of course			1
eventually , even the fittest of men — those free of addiction and tortured nights — must hang up their boots			0
and for most , it 's the worst experience of their life			1
the lifestyle , which sustained them on the straight and narrow , is bent out of all recognition			0
the lucky ones find solace in management			0
but @entity193 was never cut out for that			0
nor was he equipped for an easy number on the @entity291 sofa			0
@entity150 simply had no place for him			0
and for all of us , that 's a shame			1
because when the cheers dry up , the tears are a truly painful sight .			0
