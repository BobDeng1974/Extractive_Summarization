by @entity0 published : 17:07 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 17:07 est , 26 may 2013 plea : pope @entity1 urged mobsters to turn from crime and convert to @entity4 pope @entity1 has hit out at the @entity6 mafia for their role in human trafficking as he honoured a courageous priest murdered by the @entity10			1
speaking in @entity11 today , the @entity1 urged mobsters to abandon crime and ‘ convert to @entity4 , ’ addressing both male and female members of the mafia			1
@entity1 ’ words came the day after the beatification of the rev. @entity18 , who was shot dead in 1993 for trying to keep young people from becoming mobsters			1
the @entity21 honoured @entity18 as a martyr in the beatification ceremony in @entity24 this weekend			2
rev. @entity25 was murdered in 20 years ago , for defiantly preaching against the @entity10 in a neighbourhood of @entity24 where @entity10 held sway			0
members of the notorious @entity30 mafia convicted of ordering the killing and are serving life sentences in prison			0
the pope did not attend the beatification ceremony , which saw over 50,000 people gather in @entity24 to honour the priest			2
instead , he used the traditional sunday papal appearance in @entity11 to hail @entity18 as a martyr and ‘ an exemplary priest , especially dedicated ’ to serving young people			1
‘ educating young people according to the @entity41 , he took them away from organized crime , and thus it ( the @entity10 ) tried to defeat him by killing him , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ i think of the great pain suffered by men , women and even children , exploited by so many mafias			0
' pope @entity1 denounced the crime syndicates for making the victims of human trafficking ' do work that makes them slaves , prostitution			1
‘ behind this exploitation and slavery are the mafias			0
' @entity1 , two months into his papacy , has branded human trafficking as one of the most terrible evils plaguing the world			1
divine intervention : @entity1 , seen in the @entity21 earlier this week , attacked the @entity30 mafia families for their role in human trafficking and prostitution ‘ they can not make our brothers slaves , let us pray that these @entity10 and @entity68 convert to @entity4			1
’ @entity1 has repeatedly said his vision of the @entity70 is a ‘ poor church for the poor , ’ and encouraged clergy to work with people on society 's margins and avoid having the church turn inwards onto itself			1
murdered : the rev. @entity18 was killed by the @entity30 mafia in 1993 for preaching against them the ceremony for @entity25 this weekend , the beatification , is the third of the four steps to sainthood			1
canonisation , the process through which a person is declared saint , has been in practice in the @entity70 for over a 1,000 years			0
for someone to be considered for sainthood , the person in question must have lived a saintly life , performed a miracle , and have been dead for at least five years			0
the only known exception to this is @entity97 where the five - year rule was waived by pope @entity100 once this is fulfilled , a bishop can give permission to open up an investigation into the virtues of the individual - step one - who is then declared a ' @entity108 '			0
when enough information has been gathered by a congregation , normally the one where the candidate died or is buried , an appeal is made to the @entity1 to proclaim the person ' venerable ' - step two			2
the beatification - step three - is a statement by the @entity70 that the saint - to - be is definitely in heaven , becoming ' blessed '			0
after the beatification , a second - post-humous - miracle must occurs and be proven to have been the result of the saint - to - be 's intervention			0
when this is fulfilled , the @entity1 can declare the person a saint .			0
