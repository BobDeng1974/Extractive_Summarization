from the moment @entity1 beat @entity3 to win the world heavyweight title in 1908 , a frenzied search began			1
while @entity1 's victory would n't raise an eyebrow nowadays , it caused consternation in @entity9 for one simple reason : @entity1 was black — and a black man had never held sport 's greatest prize			1
racism was rife in @entity9 : black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life			2
as the great boxing pundit @entity20 put it , ' this was the white man 's crown			0
( to white @entity9 ) , it was as if the white man 's slave had become his master			2
' after beating @entity3 in 1908 , @entity1 became the first ever black world heavyweight champion it is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that @entity1 's victory caused			1
even liberal newspapers , such as the @entity33 , were openly hostile to the giant @entity34			0
it mattered little that @entity1 was @entity9			1
his skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white @entity9 to find a white challenger — a ' @entity40 ' — who could unseat the new champion			2
but little did white @entity9 know that it would take over six years before @entity1 would be defeated , on april 5 , 1915 , 100 years ago on sunday			1
@entity42 had believed @entity1 would be dispatched quickly			2
however , he made short work of his first four title defences , his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion @entity46 who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock @entity1 down			1
yet @entity1 had been fighting in second gear until that point and , as soon as he returned to his feet , scored a brutal knockout , uprooting several of @entity46 's teeth in the process			1
@entity55 immediately turned to finding another ' white hope '			0
there seemed an obvious choice : former world heavyweight champion @entity59 , who had retired undefeated in 1904			1
@entity59 , who as champion had dodged @entity1 , was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were			1
things did n't go as planned			0
six years out of the ring had taken its toll on @entity59 and in 1910 @entity1 stopped the former champion in 15 rounds , further enraging whites who rioted , taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate @entity1 's win			1
as many as 26 black people would be killed by lynch mobs			2
what made @entity1 even more unbearable to white @entity9 was the way he lived his life			1
a fun - loving character , @entity1 dated and married white women , and refused to live according to the social norms of the time			2
he was intelligent , eloquent and ambitious and saw no reason why his being black should hold him back from doing whatever he wanted			0
@entity9 heavyweight boxer @entity88 ( left ) with his manager @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 in april 1915 @entity1 loses his world heavyweight title to @entity88 ( left ) over the course of 26 rounds in @entity90 in 1915 like @entity95 years later , he was a trailblazer			1
he suffered dreadful discrimination , death threats and later persecution at the hands of the government			0
he took most of it in his stride			0
the same can not be said of his detractors whose efforts to unseat him became increasingly desperate			0
in 1912 , one opponent , ' @entity107 ' @entity106 , was disqualified for repeatedly trying to headbutt @entity1			2
things were getting ridiculous , but @entity1 's life outside the ring was unravelling			1
he spent money like it grew on trees and was being investigated by the @entity9 government on the spurious charge of abducting his future second wife under what was known as the @entity117 , a dubious piece of legislation designed to prevent ' white slavery '			2
he was found guilty by an all - white jury and sentenced to a year in prison			0
he fled to @entity124 and then to @entity125 , fighting three times in @entity127 , where he made history by beating ' battling ' @entity129 in the first - ever all - black heavyweight championship bout			1
next he outpointed @entity9 @entity131 over 20 rounds , though the purses for the fight were frozen after a dispute			2
with his money running low and the @entity137 breaking out in @entity125 , he accepted the challenge of another ' white hope ' from @entity9			2
his name was @entity88 , a 6ft 6in fighter , known as ' @entity141			2
' to put @entity88 's size into perspective , the average height of an @entity9 man at the time was 5ft 7in			1
the fight would take place in @entity91 and was scheduled for 45 three - minute rounds , a hell of a distance given the 40 - degree heat on the day			1
how would @entity1 , now 37 , handle a challenger four years his junior ? the champion had , quite arrogantly , barely trained for the fight			1
still , @entity88 was certainly the underdog : his size meant he was not particularly agile and he did not like hurting opponents unless they had hurt him first			0
@entity1 dominated the opening 10 rounds but his lack of conditioning soon began to tell			2
his breathing became heavy , amid the sweltering heat , and @entity88 grew in confidence			1
the writing was on the wall at the end of round 25			0
@entity1 , sat on his stool , called over fight promoter @entity173			0
' @entity1 , go take my wife away ... tell her i 'm awful weak and i want her to leave			0
' in the next round @entity88 seized his chance			0
he faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with @entity1 's jaw			1
@entity1 slumped to the canvas and took the count flat on his back			0
it was the victory that white @entity9 had been waiting for but was all as it seemed ? action from the world heavyweight title fight between @entity1 and @entity88 in @entity90 , @entity91 in 1915 photographs of the knockout appeared to show @entity1 shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall			1
his motivation , @entity1 said , was a $ 50,000 payout and a promise from the @entity9 authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence			1
@entity1 's ' confession ' was sold for a fee to @entity202 , the respected founder of @entity203			1
but @entity202 never believed @entity1 , while @entity88 was bitter about @entity1 's claim , especially as the victory was his finest hour			1
' if he was going to throw the fight i wish he 'd done it sooner , ' @entity88 said			0
' it was hotter than hell out there			0
' much of the public believed @entity1 and they had not seen the film of the contest as there was a ban on it being shown			0
it would take 40 years for the footage to see the light of day			0
when it did surface , @entity88 was vindicated , the film clearly showing him land a powerful blow			0
' i 've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when i say i that i beat @entity1 fair and square			0
' @entity88 confronted @entity1 over his claims in 1944			1
' i asked him why he made his false statement , ' @entity88 recalled			0
' he just shrugged and gave me that gold - toothed smile of his			0
@entity1 knew and i knew he was lying			0
but the fella was desperate for money , so who could blame him			0
' @entity1 would eventually end his exile and continue fighting into the 1930s			2
tragically he would die in a car crash in 1946 , speeding away from a diner that refused him service on account of his race			0
@entity88 would lose his world title in only his second defence , suffering an awful beating at the hands of @entity245 before retiring to his farm in @entity247			1
@entity1 was defeated after enduring 26 rounds in the sweltering @entity91 heat , compared to ' hell '			1

after beating @entity3 in 1908 , @entity1 became the first ever black world heavyweight champion
he held the belt for six years and sunday will mark the 100 year *anniversary* of his last title defence
during a particularly racist period of @entity9 history , @entity1 's title reign was met with many *protests*
@entity1 was eventually defeated by @entity88 in 1915 , following 26 brutal rounds in the sweltering heat of @entity91
