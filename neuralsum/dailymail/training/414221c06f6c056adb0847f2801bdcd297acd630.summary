@entity0 was killed when the @entity3 - @entity2 pet suddenly attacked her in 2013 a pet bulldog mauled a four - year - old girl to death as her mother tried desperately to beat it off with her hands and a knife			1
@entity11 told yesterday how she hit the dog as its jaws gripped the throat of her daughter @entity0			1
she then went to get ‘ the biggest knife i could find ’ and repeatedly stabbed the crazed animal , which she had taken in only weeks earlier without knowing it had six previous owners and a history of violence , an inquest heard			2
she eventually managed to stab the dog to death and carry @entity0 from the two - bedroom flat			1
miss @entity11 , 31 , said she tried to revive her daughter before paramedics – alerted by a neighbour who had heard screaming – arrived			2
@entity0 was taken to hospital but died			1
miss @entity11 told the coroner that she paid £ 50 to a rehoming centre last october for the @entity3 bulldog – which she named @entity34 after the @entity36 heroine			0
it had been advertised as ‘ better suited to a home without young children ’			1
but when she asked kennel staff about this , she was told only the dog had a ‘ tendency to jump up ’ and could knock children over because of its size			1
however , @entity34 had six owners before being taken in by @entity50 rehousing centre in @entity51 , @entity52 , in august 2013 , the inquest at @entity47 heard			0
the last of these called a warden claiming to have found the dog , thought to be aged between six and eight , wandering in a park near his home			1
police , said the man , who was not identified , had owned @entity60 for only a matter of hours when it attacked his other dog			1
he feared it could savage his young children			1
detective sergeant @entity66 of @entity67 told the inquest the man had lied about finding the animal because ‘ you have to pay to hand a dog in ’			2
it meant that kennel staff had no idea about the dog ’s background			2
the dog warden , @entity78 , said @entity34 ‘ seemed like a yard dog or guard dog ’ and ‘ did n’t seem like a family pet ’			1
in her notes to the rehoming centre , she said the dog had marks on its face which suggested it had been fighting			0
the inquest also heard that the manager of a rescue centre for @entity3 bulldogs visited the rehoming centre with a view to taking on @entity34 , but decide not to as he believed the dog was an @entity3 cross			0
at the time of the incident , police described the animal as a bulldog , and said they were working to establish the exact breed			0
mulan had been microchipped by its first owner but , when traced by the centre , he said he did not want the dog back			0
unknown to the staff at the kennels from where he was collected , the bulldog named @entity34 ( pictured ) had gone through the hands of several owners and had acted aggressively before ms @entity11 pictured today outside @entity108 and @entity109 a young @entity50 worker , who had no formal training in the assessment or behaviour of dogs , judged @entity34 to be ‘ laid back and placid ’ and suitable for rehoming			0
the inquest heard that the centre ’s only procedure for checking whether new owners were suitable was the completion of a form			0
staff were not required to visit homes before placing an animal			0
miss @entity11 said @entity34 had shown ‘ no signs of aggression at all ’ and allowed itself to be cuddled by @entity0			1
on november 5 , the girl was off school sick and watching tv in the lounge at the flat in @entity133 , near @entity47 , when the fatal attack occurred			0
miss @entity11 , a single parent , said @entity34 ‘ went stiff ’			0
she added : ‘ the dog went on all fours and stared at @entity138			0
i said , “ @entity34 ” , and tapped her and that ’s when she went for @entity0			1
the funeral for four - year - old @entity0 was held in november last year			1
pictured is the procession leaving the @entity142 in @entity51 , @entity52 ( left ) , followed by @entity0 's mother @entity11 ( right ) she went straight for her throat and then around to her mouth			1
’ @entity0 was knocked to the floor as miss @entity11 struggled with @entity34 , trying to prise open its jaws before grabbing the knife			1
asked by @entity150 , senior coroner for @entity108 and @entity52 , whether stabbing the animal was immediately successful in halting its attack , miss @entity11 replied : ‘ no.			0
. it seemed like an eternity			0
’ a post-mortem found @entity0 died from extensive injuries to her face and neck , which obstructed her airway , preventing her from breathing			2
tributes were left near the scene where @entity0 was killed in the days following the attack ( pictured ) @entity166 dr @entity165 told the court @entity0 had died of facial injuries and external airway obstruction			2
he said : ' she had extensive injuries to both her face and neck area which would be concurrent with being attacked by a dog			2
' she had slight injuries to her hands showing she had tried to fight back and had not died instantly			0
' her injuries were consistent with an external obstruction to her airways			0
