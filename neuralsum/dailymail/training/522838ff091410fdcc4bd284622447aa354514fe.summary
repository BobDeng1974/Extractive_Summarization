his blood contained both @entity21 and cocaine at the time he died			0
' in no way do i accept the coroner 's verdict of suicide , ' she told the @entity39 's 60 minutes program in an interview in 1998			0
' i will be making it abundantly clear that because of information that i and only i could know about @entity3 ... i can not accept the verdict			0
' and i wo n't have my child grow up thinking that her father left her , not knowing the way he loved her			0
' dr @entity0 has sifted through the autopsy and toxicology reports related to the famous @entity16 rocker 's death as part of a television documentary that aired on @entity11 on sunday dr @entity0 told @entity56 that @entity9 had arrived at the most logical conclusion and other than @entity3 's well known sexual appetite , there was nothing to suggest he died of auto - eroticism			1
' there is nothing i can put my finger on to say this is a sexual thing and there were significant absences of evidence , like soft ligature and pornography , ' dr @entity0 said			2
' there is nothing in @entity3 's case , other than his known sexual activities , which were extensive and frequent as far as i can gather , and that 's the only thing that points it in that direction			2
' dr @entity0 's documentary into @entity3 's death aired on sunday and it follows his tv post-mortems on celebrities @entity77 , @entity79 and @entity80			1
his expertise was called on for the inquest into the deaths of princess @entity84 and @entity86 tv presenter @entity85 and for the aftermath of the september 11 and @entity89 attacks			0
with the help of @entity2 coroner @entity9 , who presided over the original report into @entity3 's death , dr @entity0 was able to create a detailed reconstruction inside the hotel room where the rocker was found his death was reported by the @entity2 coroner to be the result of suicide			1
the moment he was found in his hotel door with a belt around his neck was reenacted for the documentary the events leading up to @entity3 's death were charted in the documentary using toxicology reports not previously seen before dr @entity0 obtained the toxicology report that was compiled after @entity3 's sudden death and spoke with mr @entity9 who has since retired			1
the @entity86 specialist said @entity3 was under immense stress on several levels and the psychological post-mortem says a lot about the @entity16 singer 's state of mind at the time of his death			2
at the top of @entity3 's issues was the battle for his only daughter , @entity121 , to accompany @entity122 to @entity123			2
dr @entity0 said the toxicology report showed there was a mixture of cocaine , alcohol and the anti-depressant @entity21 in his blood when he died dr @entity0 said his use of @entity21 was erratic and led to increased use of other drugs in the years prior to his death dr @entity0 said when you couple stress with the issues @entity3 was confronting , then mr @entity9 's finding were much clearer			1
' can i entirely scotch every rumour , 99 per cent of them i can , but there is a little gap , ' dr @entity0 said			0
' there 's all sorts of psychology that go around these hanging related deaths			0
' you look at what was happening in his life , the events around him , what was going on with the @entity16 tour , his private life and with @entity121 , @entity153 and @entity28			0
' he hit a low point on his own in that room that night			0
' the last autopsy of @entity3 was one of the most watched shows in @entity123 on sunday			0
a coroner said @entity3 's death was the result of suicide , but girlfriend and mother of his daughter @entity121 , @entity28 , publicly insisted he had died accidentally during a sex game gone wrong			1
