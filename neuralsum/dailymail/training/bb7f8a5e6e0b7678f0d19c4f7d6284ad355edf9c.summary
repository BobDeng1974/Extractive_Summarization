by @entity0 when you look at the players in midfield at @entity4 and @entity5 , it ’s hard to see anyone from @entity4 making it into @entity9 ’s side			1
they will think that ’s a slur but unfortunately for them it ’s a fact			0
@entity15 is a very good player and would have made it , but @entity17 makes that tough for him now			0
@entity18 could become world class , but you still would n’t pick him ahead of @entity21 at the moment			1
@entity4 are not short of good players , they ’re short of great players			2
they won the league at a canter last season , so this is not a bad squad , but every other side improved over the summer and @entity4 got left behind			1
superstar : @entity21 has been in blistering form for @entity5 in the past few weeks the return : @entity17 trains for the first time since coming back to @entity5 , and tops @entity15 united they stand : but would @entity15 ( left ) and @entity18 get a game at @entity5 ? splashing out : @entity5 have spent a staggering £ 229.9m since summer 2010 they are missing that stardust and , particularly when @entity37 and @entity38 do not play , they are missing match - winners			1
@entity18 has been sensational and one of @entity42 ’s most productive players , but , him apart , @entity4 lack creativity in the middle			1
@entity5 ’s midfielders have scored 26 @entity47 goals this season while @entity4 ’s have scored just seven			1
only @entity18 and @entity49 have any assists ( two each ) and the entire @entity4 midfield has made just 96 chances			1
between them , @entity21 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 have created 122 chances and across the squad , eight @entity5 midfielders have assisted goals			1
it ’s that kind of creativity @entity4 are crying out for			2
it ’s a shame for @entity64 that he ’s injured , because with @entity37 out , @entity42 could have used him further forward as another option			2
even so , i ’m still not sure he is a @entity4 player			0
towards the end of my career , when i lined up in the tunnel against them , you would look across and see @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
they were the game - changers but it ’s hard to see that in the current @entity78			1
playmaker : @entity82 star @entity53 has emerged as one of the best midfielders in the @entity47 hair apparent : @entity54 ( left ) has staked his claim for a place in the @entity5 starting @entity88 in recent weeks creative force ? @entity91 star @entity90 can barely get a game in @entity4 's midfield big - money move : but is @entity64 really a top - quality @entity4 player ? instead , it ’s @entity5 who have the exceptional talents			1
hazard is the form man , but anyone in football wo n’t be surprised by his progress			0
@entity102 said he was the best player he ’d played with while he was on loan at @entity105 and now , with extra experience , he is performing out of his skin			0
@entity54 has really impressed me , too , and is a lot tougher than i thought he would be			0
we all know how good @entity53 is			0
then you look at the rest of @entity5 ’s midfielders and the strength in depth is obvious			2
any club that can afford to leave @entity55 on the bench is a contender for the title			0
and @entity55 is exactly the kind of player @entity42 would love			0
making his point : @entity9 will finally have to concede his team are serious title contenders under - fire : @entity42 wants to be able to call upon the kind of star quality that @entity5 can strength in depth : the @entity129 can afford to leave quality like @entity131 and @entity55 on the bench the re-signing of @entity17 will only improve @entity5			1
he ’s a real thoroughbred and will protect that back four			0
in any other business it would be madness to let go of an asset and then buy it back for a much greater price , but football plays by different rules and the best players come at a cost			0
@entity9 is the master of playing the underdog , but i hope he finally admits his squad are now capable of challenging			0
he talks about how much firepower @entity147 have , and they do , but if you look at the money @entity5 have spent , they are no paupers			2
i hate to say ‘ transition ’ — it ’s an overused word — but that ’s where @entity4 are			0
it will take time and money to rebuild the midfield and the rest of the squad , but it is something they need to address quickly			0
while @entity4 continue to crave for the players to fill the boots of @entity165 and @entity74 , rivals @entity5 have been busy snapping up the game 's best midfielders			1
indeed , since 2010 the @entity129 have splashed a staggering £ 229.9million strengthening their midfield options , this in comparison to @entity4 's £ 98m			1
it is the area of the park open to most fierce criticism at @entity174 and , say many observers , the reason behind their decline			0
bring it on home : @entity17 re-joined @entity5 this month after a spell at @entity181 samba star : @entity183 signed for @entity5 in 2010 new kid on the block : @entity186 is one of two midfielders @entity5 have signed this transfer window when @entity4 and @entity5 meet at @entity191 on sunday , the disparity between the two engine - rooms will be highlighted still further as the hosts unveil £ 21m new boy @entity17 , the midfield general they re-signed from @entity181 this week			1
what would @entity42 do for such a signing ? the @entity197 boss has been trawling the continent this past fortnight in a bid to unearth the man to remedy his midfield woe			0
the @entity203 has been forced to field 40 - year - old @entity75 at the heart of his team this season , as well as on occasion defender @entity207			0
that they have been selected ahead of @entity64 – @entity42 ' sole midfield acquisition – speaks volumes for the faltering form of the £ 28m deadline - day purchase			1
@entity214 winner : @entity215 holds the blue shirt after signing in 2011 new boy : @entity219 's debut season at @entity191 has been blighted by injury @entity221 will again be reliant on teenager @entity18 for midfield inspiration this weekend			2
@entity9 , in comparison , will boast an embarrassment of riches			0
since the summer of 2012 alone , @entity5 have now spent upwards of £ 15m on five midfield players			1
@entity21 was a £ 32m arrival from @entity105 , @entity53 a £ 25m recruit from @entity230 , @entity228 's @entity131 cost £ 18m , @entity54 was a £ 32m steal from under the noses of @entity232 and now @entity17			2
short stay : @entity234 made a £ 5.5million switch from @entity236 to @entity191 marquee signing : @entity131 holds his @entity5 shirt up at the @entity240 training base rising star : a fresh - faced @entity53 proudly holds up his home shirt at the @entity243 in that same period @entity4 have signed four midfielders ; @entity90 , a player who has struggled to impact , @entity245 , currently on loan at @entity247 , @entity248 , an outcast under @entity221 , and , of course , the disappointing @entity64			1
but perhaps most galling of all for @entity42 and followers of @entity4 will be the sight of £ 23m @entity55 warming the bench ; how they would long for the @entity254 to fill the playmaker role once populated by @entity74			1
mega money : @entity54 joined from @entity258 for a whopping £ 32million last summer then there is @entity260 , @entity5 's in - form anchorman who was all set for a move to @entity4 in 2005 before the west @entity262 intervened and prised him from their grasp			1
it all leaves @entity42 casting envious eyes towards @entity9 and his midfield men			2
the @entity4 chief will seek to strengthen this month but that will not come in time for sunday 's @entity269			2
if that game is won or lost in the middle of the park , then there will surely be just one victor			0
injury prone : @entity276 is unveiled by former manager @entity277 young gun : @entity279 joined @entity5 from @entity247 but has since been loaned out to @entity236 on his way out ? @entity281 looks set to leave @entity5 this window for the @entity283 by @entity284			0

@entity5 have spent staggering £ 229.9m on midfielders since summer 2010
@entity42 continues to scout in @entity288 for recruits
@entity18 is a rising star but you would pick @entity5 's in - form @entity21 over the @entity4 starlet
@entity129 midfielders have scored 26 league goals this season compared to @entity4 's seven
@entity4 used to have game - changers like @entity73 and @entity74 but now it 's @entity9 's side who have the talent
