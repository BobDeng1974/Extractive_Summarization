@entity3 issued a statement on saturday confirming that they had rejected two offers from @entity9 and that @entity11 was not for sale but @entity2 needs funds to strengthen his squad and may yet be forced to sacrifice the prolific striker			1
@entity9 have £ 12m to spend following the sale of @entity19 and may be prepared to throw all of that at @entity3 to get @entity11 who scored in yesterday 's 3 - 2 win over @entity22 , his 54th in 100 appearances for the club			1
transfer : @entity11 has been the subject of two separate bids from @entity28 side @entity9 manager @entity29 is desperate to bring in a striker			1

' despite the necessity to comply with and address the pending restrictions of @entity44 regulations , the owners feel it would be a detrimental step to lose our top goalscorer and such an icon of this football club			0
tally : the @entity68 international has scored 53 goals in 99 appearances for @entity3 ' we made our intentions clear this summer when we rewarded @entity11 with a new and improved contract and we stand by that			2
' we want to give @entity2 and the team the best possible opportunity to get back to the top flight and @entity11 has been and remains a significant part of that aim			0
' it is also important to acknowledge that @entity11 has acted , unsurprisingly , in a totally professional manner during this period of speculation			0
