they ’re the upmarket vegetables that we order from a menu but for many of us they ’re too intimidating to cook at home			2
@entity7 , artichokes and sweet potatoes are counted among the sides that people like to order at a restaurant but are clueless when it comes to preparing them in our own kitchens			0
research by @entity18 found that almost three quarters of customers buy and cook more vegetables than they did in the past , and are trying branching out in their vegetable choices			1
and a sizeable 57 % said they now consider interesting vegetables to be a meal in their own right , rather than just an accompaniment to a meat dish			1
artichokes are counted among the sides that people like to order at a restaurant but are clueless when it comes to preparing them but research has found that while we may be keen to try more adventurous vegetables , we do n’t know how to prepare or cook for ourselves			1
the survey found that 35 % of customers would use exotic vegetables such as pak choi , okra and beetroot at home if they were pre-prepared and ready for cooking			1
customers classified these vegetables as ‘ difficult to cook ’ as opposed to broccoli , carrots and mushrooms , which were described as easy to cook but ‘ boring ’			2
but now supermarkets are responding to the @entity53 desire to push the culinary boundaries			0
@entity18 has launched the @entity53 ’s first miniature sweet potato , ‘ @entity56 ’ as a result of finding that customers were unsure how to cook and prepare normal bulbous sweet potatoes			0
sweet potatoes are another favourite vegetable that people are not confident to cook with the baby sweet potatoes are a third of the size of their traditional counterparts and are more tender and cook much faster			0
@entity68 , @entity69 , said : ‘ after seeing the research that our customers found sweet potatoes one of the most difficult vegetables to prepare and cook we wanted to offer something that reduced the hassle			1
‘ both delicious and nutrient - packed these baby versions can be roasted whole			0
and with more fibre , less calories and less carbs they are a healthy and delicious alternative to white potatoes			0
’ last month @entity84 announced the launch of baby avocadoes in its ‘ essentials ’ range , which join the ranks of baby carrots , baby corn and baby asparagus as the pint - sized plants in supermarket aisles			0
the demand for a wider variety of vegetables in supermarkets comes as many people choose to move away from a carnivorous diet to a plant - based one , as well as the craze for ‘ superfoods ’ – foods which contain high levels of vitamins and minerals			2
out of the 3,000 people surveyed , almost half said they are trying to eat less meat , and a quarter ( 23 per cent ) are trying to replace meat with more beans , lentils and pulses .			1
