a teenage girl died after doctors failed to carry out basic checks that may have revealed she was suffering from life - threatening brain damage , an inquest has heard			2
doctors at @entity6 in @entity7 did n't check if @entity8 , 15 , could open her eyes or examine her pupil size after she was admitted suffering headaches , vomiting and fitting			1
but a duty doctor said that the tests , which may have indicated that her condition was deteriorating , were n't carried out because he ' did n't worry too much ' about the schoolgirl and believed that she was ' getting better '			1
@entity8 's mother , @entity17 , said : ' she wanted to be a paedatrician and she was a promising student so we are sure she would be at university now			2
we have had to hold it together for our four other children , but we miss her every day			0
' @entity8 , who had just finished her mock gcse exams , died of a swelling on the brain on november 19 2008 , but it has taken experts five years to find out how she died			1
@entity28 heard that @entity8 , from @entity29 , @entity7 , had suffered headaches for seven days and was admitted to the hospital 's @entity32 department on november 16 after she began vomiting and fitting			1
she was admitted to an adult ward at the hospital because there was a lack of beds at @entity40 's paediatric intensive care units and was given a ct scan , sedated and put on a ventilator			1
lawyers for @entity8 's family claim that doctors failed to properly investigate why scans showed that her brain was swollen			2
instead of carrying out checks on her condition , doctors believed that @entity8 's condition was stabilising the day after she was admitted to hospital and the court heard that she was largely ignored by consultants			1
they decided to send the teenager for a lumbar puncture on november 19 to remove brain fluid from her spine and carry out tests to find out if her condition was caused by bacteria			2
@entity8 was admitted to @entity6 in @entity7 after suffering headaches , vomiting and fitting but consultant paediatrician dr @entity61 said that the tests should only be carried out if her condition stabilised and she responded to neurological tests first - otherwise a lumbar puncture could cause more problems by acting as a suction and pulling the brain down			1
the inquest heard however , that tests were not carried out after duty doctor @entity70 was told by a colleague that @entity8 's condition had improved and that scans were normal			1
he told the court : ' with hindsight the neurological observations should have been done			0
it was n’t done because , to me , i did n’t worry too much about @entity8 because i believed her to be a young girl getting better			2
' i did n’t focus on the neurological observations at all			0
at that moment in time we were just waiting for the lumbar puncture to take place			0
i did n’t need to interfere with the plan			0
' ' i did n’t worry too much about @entity8 because i believed her to be a young girl getting better			2
' dr @entity70 although doctors argued that @entity8 's sedation would have made the tests difficult to carry out and may not have shown problems straight away , dr @entity70 admitted that they might have helped			1
' i am not denying that neurological observations would have helped with @entity8 ’s condition			0
' but the handover to me was that the patient was waking up and was getting better			0
' further scans the same day showed mass fluid on the brain and she later died of encephalitis			0
doctors also defended their decision to sedate the youngster with propofol - a drug known to cause high levels of potassium and abnormal heart rhythms in children - instead of the normal morphine			0
dr @entity70 , said : ' i would do the same again in the same situation			0
@entity8 was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at @entity40 's paediatric intensive care units ' when you stop infusing propofol it wears off fairly quickly			1
i knew she needed to be woken up the next morning			0
' we know we should n’t use it in very small children on a high dosage for a long time , but @entity8 was adult size and the amount we were given was very minor			1
' the inquest continues today and is expected to conclude tomorrow			0

@entity8 was admitted to @entity6 in @entity7 after she *'d* been vomiting and fitting
she was admitted to an adult ward because there were no beds in the children 's ward
one doctor said he ' did n't worry too much ' about the checks because @entity8 was ' getting better '
@entity8 died in november 2008 , but it has taken experts five years to find out how she died
