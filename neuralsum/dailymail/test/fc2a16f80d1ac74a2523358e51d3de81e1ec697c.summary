it was set as a maths problem , aimed at testing the logical reasoning skills of 14 - year - olds in @entity4			1
but the question went viral after people across the world were left completely baffled			1
the problem , which tests logical reasoning , has been shared thousands of times online as people have tried to pose their best explanations of what at first appears to be an impossible question			1
a maths question set for 14 - year - olds has left people across the world baffled as they try to solve the puzzle the test was set for 14 - year - olds in the @entity4 and @entity19			1
the @entity19 often features logical reasoning questions and are set to test top achievers			1
@entity22 tweeted : ‘ if @entity24 makes it this hard to find out when her birthday is , she ’s not going to get many gifts			0
’ @entity28 joked : ‘ @entity24 obviously did n’t want @entity29 and @entity30 at her party			0
should have taken the hint when @entity24 decided to play this little game			0
’ one man in @entity35 said : ‘ i did not have a bleeding clue ! i wish i were as clever to answer something like this			0
but my brain just does n’t work like that			0
’ the test asked : @entity29 and @entity30 just became friends with @entity24 , and they want to know when her birthday is			1
@entity24 gives them a list of 10 possible dates			0
may 15 , may 16 , may 19 june 17 , june 18 july 14 , july 16 august 14 , august 15 , august 17 @entity24 then tells @entity29 and @entity30 separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively			1
@entity29 : i do n’t know when @entity24 ’s birthday is , but i know that @entity30 does not know too			0
@entity30 : at first i do n’t know when @entity24 ’s birthday is , but i know now			0
@entity29 : then i also know when @entity24 ’s birthday is			0
so when is @entity24 ’s birthday ? organisers of @entity49 said the question was set to filter out the most intelligent of participants at first the question appears impossible to answer without a bit of extra information , but we know @entity24 has already told @entity29 the month of her birthday , and @entity30 the day			1
each of the men does not know what the other has been told			0
this allows reasoning to be used to begin to whittle down the number of options			1
so , firstly , for @entity29 to be ' certain ' that @entity30 can not know the answer - as suggested in the first statement he makes - we can deduct that the birthday is not in may or june			1
this is because in the months of may and june there are numbers ( dates ) that only occur once across the four months - namely may 19 and june 18			2
if @entity29 had been given may or june as the month , there is no way he could be certain that @entity30 does n't know the birthday			0
@entity30 , after all , might have been the number 18 or 19			2
for @entity29 to be ' certain ' that @entity30 does n't know , @entity29 must have been given a month that does not contain one of these ' unique ' dates - i.e. july or august			2
@entity29 's disclosure now gives @entity30 the clue he needs , and says he now knows the birthday			0
@entity30 only knows the number of @entity24 ’s birthday , but from @entity29 ’s statement he has now also ruled out both may and june			2
this is because he realises @entity29 has ruled out may and june because of the ' single number ' aspect above			2
so there are now just five remaining dates - july 14 , july 16 , aug 14 , aug 15 , aug 17 - and @entity30 says he knows which is the birthday			1
because he now knows the date , we can whittle it down further to three dates by ruling out the numbers that appear in duplicate			0
at first , the question appears impossible top answer without more information , but here 's how to work it out if @entity24 had told @entity30 that her birthday fell on the 14th of the month , then he could not have worked out the date at this stage			2
however , as he states that he now knows the date , we can rule out july 14 or august 14			2
this leaves just three dates to chose from - july 16 , aug 15 and aug 17			2
following @entity30 's statement , @entity29 is then apparently able to deduce the date of @entity24 's birthday			0
this means her birthday must be the only remaining date in the month he was originally told			0
given that there are two dates left in august and one in july , it has to be the july date			0
so the answer is july 16			0
the problem was posted on @entity117 by ‘ @entity4 ’ television presenter @entity118 , and went viral as people posted their various solutions to the problem			1
it was set for 14 - year - olds in the @entity4 and @entity124 ( @entity49 ) , which were held on april 8			1
this year around 28,000 students from countries across the world including @entity4 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and the @entity131 took the test			1
@entity133 , executive director of @entity49 , told @entity134 : ' being @entity135 out of 25 questions , this is a difficult question meant to sift out the better students			1
@entity49 contests target the top 40 % of the student population and the standards of most questions are just high enough to stretch the students			1
' of course , perhaps the more important question is whether @entity24 deserves a birthday gift at all after putting us through all of this .			2
