by @entity0 published : 01:58 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 4 june 2013 a woman who was raped by a stranger in an alleyway has waived her right to anonymity to share her harrowing story and give other victims the courage to report their attacks			1
@entity9 , who is in her forties , was attacked after leaving a bar in @entity12 on @entity13 2011			1
she was drunk at the time so did not remember the ordeal until the following morning when she had some frightening flashbacks and felt so sore it hurt to even sit down			0
@entity9 told the @entity18 her experience was ' most people 's worst nightmare ' and something she still struggles to deal with today - but she wanted to share her story in the hope it will give strength to other rape victims and change society 's view on the taboo subject			1
but no - one deserves to be raped			2
' i had done nothing wrong , i had just gone out for a drink			0
it happened to me and it could happen to anyone , male or female			0
' victims need to come forward and report rape so a clear message is sent to rapists that they will not get away with it			2
' with the support of the @entity57 's @entity56 in @entity12 , one of 46 specialist centres in the @entity60 for rape victims , @entity9 was able to see her attacker brought to justice			1
a new @entity65 documentary , @entity66 : rape , that airs this evening , reveals the work the centre is doing to help people like @entity9			1
in the footage , @entity9 explains how she had gone out to celebrate on @entity13 after first drinking a bottle of wine at home			1
she had another drink and a shot and was expelled from the bar by the doorman as she appeared very ' out of it '			0
she said : ' i remember feeling really out of it and going , " what the hell are you doing here , @entity9 ? go home ! " and then it 's blank			1
' many victims of rape do n't report it because they feel ashamed or experience self - blame			2
but no - one deserves to be raped ' ' my next memory , and i did n’t remember this until the next morning , and it ’s in an alleyway ... i don’tremember what 's happened			1
except the alleyway and then somebody holding me there and holding me and holding me			2
' @entity9 could recall elements of a sexual attack but her memory was sketchy			1
after reporting what she could remember to the police , @entity103 footage , her injuries and a forensic examination helped piece together her horrific ordeal			2
after examining @entity9 , it was found she had injuries to her mouth consistent with forced oral sex			1
other swabs taken from her found evidence she had also had sexual intercourse - something she had no recollection of			1
support : @entity9 saw her attacker jailed thanks to the help of dr @entity121 ( forensic doctor at @entity57 's @entity56 ) , left , and pc @entity123 from @entity125 after being told about what the doctors had found , @entity9 was shocked she could n't remember what had happened			1
she said : ' i still do n’t remember and i still ca n’t believe that it ’s happened			0
i still want it to have not happened			0
i wish somebody would come and say , " @entity9 , you got it all wrong "			1
but i know that ’s not going to happen			0
' @entity9 said learning to live with what had happened to her was difficult and she frequently suffered from anxiety attacks			1
' you ca n't let it be you			0
and that 's what i ’ve really learnt			0
my identity is n't ' i got raped '			2
but i 'm forever altered ' she said : ' i could n’t even get to the shops without freaking out and running home			0
you feel like everything you touch is going to be soiled with what has happened to you			0
' at first , @entity9 also had to live with the fact her attacker was still at large - and she had no idea who he was and if he could strike again			1
do n't suffer in silence : many victims of rape are too ashamed to come forward but @entity9 said they should report the crime so attackers are punished ( posed by model ) however using the dna swabs that were taken from her , @entity125 's serious sexual offences unit made a match with a 20 - year - old male called @entity162			1
in many rape cases , there is not enough evidence to prosecute			2
but thanks to the @entity103 footage of @entity9 leaving the bar looking drunk and stumbling from an alleyway some time later , the dna evidence , and footage of @entity162 in the area on the same evening , he was charged			1
he pleaded not guilty but after hearing all the evidence , a jury found him guilty of rape			1
he was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison and put on the sex offenders register			0
@entity9 said it was a relief to know her attacker would be jailed but it was a ' hollow victory ' given he was given a short sentence while she has to live with what happened forever			1
but she hopes her case gives other victims hope of some justice			2
' i did n't even remember my attack but the guy was still convicted thanks to the forensic evidence , ' she said			1
justice : even though @entity9 could n't remember all of her ordeal , her attacker was found guilty thanks to the forensic evidence ( posed by model ) @entity9 's is one of thousands of rape cases that the @entity57 's clinic deals with every year involving women , men and children			1
but dr @entity202 from the clinic said @entity9 's case was unusual in that ' stranger rapes in the alleyway are really quite rare			1
' she added : ' the vast majority are people that are known , whether it 's partner , ex partner , colleague			0
and that 's in the adults			0
when you move into the children , particularly the younger you go with the children , the more likely it is to be somebody they know			0
' today , @entity9 said she is still haunted by her experience and can suffer from flashbacks			2
she has moved away from @entity12 and said she wo n't go into the city centre again because it makes her so anxious			0
she added : ' i 'm more reserved now and not as out - going as i used to be			0
but while i ca n't forget what happened , i have learned to live with it			0
' you ca n't let it be you			0
and that ’s what i ’ve really learned			0
my identity is n't " i got raped "			2
but i 'm forever altered			0
' i hope people who see my story on the documentary will see that i have survived - and i hope that will give them strength			2
' the @entity66 : rape will be on @entity65 10.35pm tuesday , 4 june			0

she waived her right to anonymity to share her story
she hopes it will help other victims and change views on the taboo subject
