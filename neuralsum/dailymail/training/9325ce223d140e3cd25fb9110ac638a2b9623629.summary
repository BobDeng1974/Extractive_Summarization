by @entity0 published : 14:06 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 20:07 est , 23 september 2013 first - time parents @entity1 and @entity3 were told to expect the worst when their 13 - month - old daughter suffered a stroke and three heart attacks in one go			1
@entity9 ' died ' three times in a hospital ward after contracting what doctors thought was a minor chest infection			1
the medical team said she would be lucky to survive - and if she did , she would be severely brain damaged			0
but the stunned surgeons have been forced to swallow their words after the fragile infant made a miracle recovery in just four weeks - and now she is as healthy as any other baby her age			2
miracle : @entity25 's heart stopped three times in 12 days after she contracted heart disease beaten the odds : days after a stroke that lasted 48 hours , the toddler made an almost full recovery @entity1 , 34 , and @entity3 , 39 , from @entity31 , @entity32 , rushed their daughter to @entity35 on 23 june after she was repeatedly violently sick			1
after an initial scan , medics diagnosed @entity9 's heart attack as a chest infection			1
but her condition rapidly deteriorated and just three hours later she had another attack			0
happy : @entity1 , a secretary , and @entity3 , a floor filler , were told their first - born would not make it - and if she did she would be severely brain damaged her heart stopped for four - and - a - half minutes - rendering her technically dead			2
further tests showed @entity9 had contracted myocarditis - a severe form of heart disease			1
most cases of myocarditis are contracted through a virus like mumps , the flu , or a common cold			0
the muscles of the heart inflame causing anything from a minor chest infection to life - threatening heart disease			1
like all viruses , there is no clear treatment for the disease			2
surviving against all odds , with only a quarter of her heart functioning , @entity9 was transferred to the specialist ward two hours ' drive away at @entity70 in @entity71 for a heart transplant			2
the fragile baby , unable to function independently , was put on life support as doctors plan their next step			2
but the medics changed tact when , after 12 days on an @entity80 breathing machine , she seemed to have recovered , so they took her off			1
however , 45 minutes later , @entity9 's third heart attack hit , and she started having a stroke			1
for the next 48 hours she would suffer 25 violent fits , and ' die ' twice			0
doctors told @entity85 and mrs page their daughter had a bleed on the brain that could kill her or at least cause severe brain damage			1
inexplicably , @entity9 made an almost complete recovery in just a few days			0
at the end of july - just four weeks after she was admitted - she was able to go home			0
mrs @entity25 , who has two older children , said : ' the whole time @entity9 was in hospital just felt so surreal , we kept thinking that things like this do n't happen to @entity100			1
' she went so quickly from a healthy , happy baby to fighting for her life			0
relieved : @entity1 and @entity3 embrace their baby girl in hospital when doctors said she could go home misdiagnosis : doctors told the couple their daughter had a chest infection after she had suffered a heart attack ' when she had the first heart attack , we thought that was the worst that could happen - but then to have another two and a stroke was unthinkable			1
' we started to worry what type of girl we would end up with after all the trauma her body had faced			0
' we did n't know whether she 'd ever be able to walk , or even talk			0
' two months later , she is still as healthy as any other 15 - month - old baby			2
home and healthy : mr @entity3 , 39 , clutches his first - born , who is now as healthy as any 15 - month - old baby recovered : @entity9 was on a life support machine for 12 days but incredibly fought her way back mr @entity3 , 39 , branded his first - born 's recovery a ' miracle '			1
he said : ' my baby is back to the happy little girl she always was , she died three times but still managed to cling on to life - it 's a miracle			0
' she is a little fighter and amazed everyone by pulling through			0
we are so proud , and feel so happy to have her home			0
' the delighted couple have pledged to pay for a new Â£ 40,000 ecmo machine at @entity70 .			0

@entity25 , 13 months , suffered three heart attacks and a stroke in 12 days
doctors at @entity35 mistook *mycocarditis* , a severe form of heart disease , for a chest infection
she has been healthy and stable for two months since being discharged
