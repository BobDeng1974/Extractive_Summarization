by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 7 may 2013 it is not the only example of @entity4 authorities pushing ahead with building projects before all obstacles are out of the way			2
residents have been pushed out of their homes by builders digging moats around their properties and ripping out their staircases			2
but in the case of this part - demolished @entity17 car park , it is a driver who has been backed into an impossible corner			1
the lone car is parked in a bay , surrounded by the debris of the flattened car park			1
it is said that the car park in @entity17 , @entity25 was scrapped as part of a street - broadening project			1
stranded : the parking bad is perfectly intact , but the piles of rubble surrounding the car mean it will have to be removed with a crane strange sight : a woman and baby survey the bizarre view			0
the car is facing a row of shops and is though to be owned by someone working for a local company the site was used as for parking by a local company			1
builders went ahead with demolishing the area after waiting for the car to be moved for ten days			1
when the owner failed to return to the car , workers were told they could n't wait any longer			1
the bizarre sight of the white vehicle stranded in a sea of stone has stopped passers - by in their tracks			2
the piles of rubble and large chunks of concrete leave no clear path for the car to be driven out			0
it is not known whether drivers were informed of when the car park was to be flattened , but the owner of this vehicle seems to be none - the - wiser			1
it would take a @entity71 effort to escape this jam without the help of a crane			0
many @entity4 development projects have forced residents to vacate their homes , by starting work before they have moved out			0
what was a predominantly rural country is undergoing massive change with a building boom that has seen half of @entity4 's enormous 1.3 billion population already urbanised , according to official statistics			0
developers of an office block in @entity88 , @entity89 province , got fed up with negotiating with local home so they diverted a local river to encircles the residents			0
anyone in there ? : a security guard peers into the abandoned car			0
its owner had not claimed it in the 10 days before the demolition			2
builders were ordered to go ahead with their work as the project could n't be delayed further surrounded : an elderly couple refused to leave their home in @entity107 , despite plans for a road to be built			2
developers went ahead and built to motorway around the property room with a view : with space a t apremium in the densely populated city of @entity118 in @entity4 's @entity120 province , homeowners decided to build these villas on the roof of the @entity124 shopping centre @entity125 : developers forgot to build an underground car park with this block of flats			1
builders started digging down once the apartments were completed on the horizon : this 328m skyscraper in @entity134 , @entity135 province , dwarfs everything around it			0
it was built in a village of 2,000 farmers and its closet rival is 600 miles away in @entity142			0

demolition of @entity17 car park goes ahead around the one parked car left in bay used by local company
builders held off for ten days for owner to return to vehicle but could n't delay street - widening project any longer
