the last remaining polar bear at @entity1 has died after overheating in soaring summer temperatures			1
' winner , ' who was one of best loved attractions at the zoo , is believed to have been unable to control its body temperature in the extreme heat of the @entity10 summer and died of hyperthermia			1
the animal , which was covered in heavy fur to cope with freezing conditions in its native @entity16 habitat , was also believed to have been frightened by the noise from fireworks let off to celebrate @entity20			1
the animals used to live in a pool but their cage was improved in 1993 when a 145,000 - litre pool was built along with a site for birthing and three security rings			2
the zoo said in a statement that it had been visited by experts and met all international regulations to house polar bears			1
heat : ' winner ' was a popular attraction for visitors to the @entity47 ( seen here swimming in his pool ) environment : designed to survive in the @entity52 - polar bears do not cope well in very hot conditions the polar bear is often regarded as a marine mammal because of the large amount of time it spends at sea			1
its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf in the @entity52			0
the animal is a very good swimmer with some spotted in the sea as far as 200 miles from land			0
@entity68 : polar bears often spend as much time in the sea as they do on land as they hunt for prey polar bears can not simply acclimatise to hot climates			2
even if a polar bear is born in a warm climate and lives there all of his life , he will still possess several physiological adaptations to life in the @entity82			1
even if he loses some fur and blubber , he will always have black skin that absorbs heat and hollow hairs which work as efficient solar collectors			0
polar bears do not have any physical means of staying cool ; they rely on behaviour to do that			2
they will try to take as much shade as possible during the warmest parts of the day and cool off in cold water when they overheat			0
zookeepers may try and balance their energy expenditure and food intake to regulate their body temperature and may be fed a vegetarian diet or simply very little during warmer times ( eating meat and fat generates immediate heat energy )			0
the bottom line is that polar bears can be resilient but this does not mean that they are comfortable			2
polar bears are found in the @entity112 and on neighbouring land masses as far south as @entity114 in @entity115			2
some sightings have even been reported in the far north of @entity118			0
the bears are rarer in the extreme north of the @entity82 although the animal is believed to roam across right across the region			0
they tend to favour hunting on sea ice and in the sea in search of prey such as seals			0
@entity129 bears often frequent areas where sea ice meets water - primarily around the edges of the ice pack , where more seals can be found			0
the global polar bear population is believed to be between 20,000 and 25,000 with 19 recognized sub-populations			1
the polar bear is the largest terrestrial carnivore , with adult males weighing between 350 and 680 kg ( 770 â€“ 1500 lbs ) and measuring between 7.9 and 9.8 ft in length .			1
