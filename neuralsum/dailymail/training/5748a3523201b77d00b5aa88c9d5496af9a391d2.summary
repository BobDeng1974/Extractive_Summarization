by @entity0 last updated at 11:08 am on 20th january 2012 the @entity2 app lets users share what exhibitions they 've been to : like all @entity6 , it posts updates about what you 're doing to friends , and also offers them a chance to install the app themselves @entity15 has launched 60 new ' timeline ' apps - applications that post updates in real time about what people are doing , and also add updates to people 's timeline			1
@entity15 claims the update - live from today - will allow users to ' personalise ' their page more , adding updates that reflect their interests , and sharing them with your friends list , or with lists you authorise for each app. it has potential to be a radical change to how people view the site , with food fans able to share recipes and restaurant reviews with other users , and book fans able to automatically ' share ' what ebooks they 've read			1
as ever with @entity15 , there are privacy concerns			0
many sites recommend vetting apps carefully to see what they will post , and creating lists of friends to ' share ' certain updates with , rather than bombarding your whole friends list			1
tech site @entity54 warns , ' once you install the app and authorize it to post stories on your profile and @entity60 , it 'll never ask for your permission again			1
' the update - live today - will be a huge overhaul for most people 's experience of @entity15			1
the site 's algortihm with try to predict posts you are interested in based on your apps and posts , and will prioritise both your news feed , and your own timeline based on this			1
the profile of a foodie will feel distinctly different to the profile of a bookworm , for instance			0
up until now , @entity6 tended to be largely about music			0
after the site 's recent overhaul , applications such as @entity80 started to post updates saying ' this person is listening to ... ' which appear in @entity15 's news ticker			1
but the idea - and the number of updates - is set to go much bigger			0
the new apps will add updates about cooking , eating , films , concerts , books and travelling			2
the apps will add updates to @entity98 ( the fast - scrolling feed up the right hand side of @entity15 ) and to your timeline			1
some may also post directly into your news feed			1
@entity15 is soliciting developers to make apps for every area of interest the @entity108 app lets people share what films they 've watched , and what films they want to watch the @entity113 app is one of several applications that let users share recipes , what they 've eaten and what they want to try with @entity15 's new ' frictionless sharing ' , it should mean that people 's news tickers are even more densely populated than ever - and that people , once again , start ' sharing ' without realising what they 're doing , as users have seen with @entity15 games , apps and indeed @entity80			2
the apps include timeline apps from @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity108 , pose , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , and others			0
' you can now enhance your timeline with apps that help you tell your story , whether you love to cook , eat , travel , run , or review movies , ' says @entity15			0
' once you 've added an app , you can begin updating your timeline with your activities as they happen			0
for example , if you love design , shopping or fashion , you can add the @entity133 or pose apps to make your favorite items part of your timeline			0
' the @entity134 app syncs with the popular ebook reader and shares what people have read and ' liked ' via their timeline ' if you love to cook , you can add the @entity131 app to your timeline and share your latest dishes			0
if your friends have added the @entity131 app , you can discover new recipes with each other , as you 'll see their updates in the ticker and their timeline , and possibly @entity60			2
' @entity15 says that more timeline apps , covering more interests will launch soon			2
' our vision for @entity171 and our vision for the application platform is whatever you love and whatever story you want to tell , you can add that to your timeline , ' said @entity175 , @entity15 's product management @entity139 with apps and @entity178 message to developers is ' start your engines ' , ' said @entity175 .			0
