this is according to a study that shows , for the first time , how these reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world but their ancestors were very different creatures , with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales			0
the study , by @entity33 , reveals how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable these fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments @entity38 , who led the research , said : ‘ the ancestors of today 's crocodiles have a fascinating history that is relatively unknown compared to their dinosaur counterparts			1
today , most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish			0
but their ancestors were very different creatures , with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales sample of jaws from the @entity56 crocodile record ‘ they were very different creatures to the ones we are familiar with today , much more diverse and , as this research shows , their ability to adapt was quite remarkable			0
‘ their evolution and anatomical variation during the @entity56 was exceptional			0
‘ they evolved lifestyles and feeding ecologies unlike anything seen today			0
" the team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the @entity56 - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years			1
the study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the @entity78 seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey , such as fish			1
the research also found that variation peaked again in the @entity84 period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food			1
after the devastating end - triassic extinction event , crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish			1
they also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the @entity84 - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs , including eating plants			2
surprisingly , the lower jaws of @entity84 crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation			1
instead , the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy , such as armadillo - like body armour			1
dr @entity110 , from the @entity111 said : ‘ our results show that the ability to exploit a variety of different food resources and habitats , by evolving many different jaw shapes , was crucial to recovering from the end - @entity120 extinction and most likely contributed to the success of @entity56 crocodiles living in the shadow of the dinosaurs			0
