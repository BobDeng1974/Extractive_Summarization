mothers are made to feel ' marginalised and ashamed ' when they breastfeed in public , according to an international study			1
researchers also found that many new mothers are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers			2
mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as ' hippies ' or ' weirdos '			1
others said they wanted to breastfeed after 12 months but feared public disapproval			2
mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as ' hippies ' or ' weirdos ' ( file picture ) negative emotions are also common for new mothers trying to breastfeed in hospital soon after giving birth due to staff actions and comments , the study found			1
other findings included : * mothers fear if they breastfeed in public they may be seen as ' hippies , weirdoes or naturalists ' while others reported being stared at , frowned at and tutted at * new mothers in hospital wanting help with feeding were asked to ' stop buzzing ' and some were told their baby was ' too lazy ' or ' too eager ' * others felt distressed by midwives objectifying and handling their breasts in front of their partners * experiences of shame over baby feeding mean the process can be seen as ' effectively a disease or analagous to one ' * a family history of breastfeeding encouraged women to do the same but negative family comments put women off * women breastfeeding children of 12 months or older felt ' uncomfortable ' due to being seen as ' not normal ' dr @entity55 , of the @entity56 and @entity57 and @entity58 at the @entity59 in @entity60 , led the study , which also involved researchers in @entity63 and @entity64			1
the research , published online in @entity56 , involved interviews and focus groups with 63 women from a range of backgrounds in two primary care trust areas in @entity72			1
two thirds of the women were breastfeeding at the time they were interviewed but the duration of breastfeeding varied from a few days to more than 12 months and only a small minority said they breastfed in public			2
breastfeeding is known to have important health benefits for mothers and babies			1
according to the @entity84 , breastfed babies have less chance of diarrhoea and vomiting , fewer chest and ear infections and less chance of becoming obese , while women who breastfeed have a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer			1
but only 46 per cent of @entity96 mothers exclusively breastfeed their child at one week old compared to 83 per cent in @entity64 , the authors state			1
many new mothers are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers , the study found at six months , less than one per cent of @entity96 mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding compared to 11 per cent in @entity64			1
the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of a child 's life â€“ and continuing to provide breast milk until a child is two or beyond			0
the authors wrote : ' the findings of this paper highlight how breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women may experience judgement and condemnation in interactions with health professionals as well as within community contexts , leading to feelings of failure , inadequacy and isolation			0
' they added that the findings ' emphasise how breastfeeding women feel equally marginalised and shamed [ as non-breastfeeding women ] , as expressed in their social and clinical encounters and fears about breastfeeding in public spaces			0
' as poor care and negative emotions are experienced by women irrespective of their infant feeding methods , these insights highlight how breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women require targeted needs - led support throughout the perinatal period			0
' many of the women felt ' out of control ' due to poor information about feeding choices or lack of support			0
new infant feeding groups that put breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women together could help provide better support , the authors argued			0
at six months , less than one per cent of @entity96 mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding compared to 11 per cent in @entity64 the research was part of an evaluation of the @entity152 project , which accredits maternity and community facilities that adopt internationally recognised standards of best practice			1
@entity157 , professional policy advisor at the @entity159 , said : ' at the end of the antenatal period the health service dumps women and sends them home with very little support , even though they 've been told that breastfeeding is best			0
' a lot of women are crying out for help and that 's one of the reasons they give up breastfeeding			0
' there 's a shortage of midwives and if they have to prioritise they will prioritise the women in labour , not the ones who have already given birth			0
' she said ' outward signs ' from society that breastfeeding in public is not welcomed were also a problem			0
' if you go to a major store in the @entity96 they put the breastfeeding area in a toilet			2
even in an @entity84 trust a woman has been asked to stop breastfeeding			2

survey asked 63 mothers who said they were tutted at and seen as ' hippies '
research was published in the online *journal* @entity56
@entity96 mothers breastfeed new babies at half the rate of those in @entity64
