when @entity1 walks out at @entity2 tomorrow as one of three home - grown female wildcards , she will carry the unwanted and , she says , unmerited reputation of being the wild child of @entity10 tennis			1
the former under - 18 @entity10 girls ’ champion remains fiercely unrepentant about what she claims was an innocent girls ’ night out seven years ago that almost ruined her career and triggered a devastating family row			1
the scandal was caused when she posted a photo of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively in a minidress next to a condom machine in a toilet			2
tennis ' former wild child : @entity1 , 24 , claims the photo of her posing next to a condom machine on a night out seven years ago ( right ) has ruined her career it caught the attention of the press and sparked the wrath of the @entity30 , which promptly stripped her of her funding , throwing the future of her career in jeopardy			1
similar action was taken against another player , @entity36 , who shared a picture of himself surrounded by pizza boxes			1
miss @entity1 says the scandal has made her tennis career a struggle ever since			1
unlike her rivals , she has no coach and travels alone to tournaments			1
speaking for the first time about the incident , @entity45 , now 24 , said : ‘ i do n’t know why it was such a big deal			1
i was n’t drunk and i was n’t doing drugs either			1
i was trying to live , for a few nights at least , as a normal 17 - year - old			1
it was blown out of all proportion			2
‘ i was disgusted with how the @entity30 handled things			2
they warned me the picture would be appearing in the next day ’s newspapers , but i heard nothing after that			2
frustration : the former junior champion chose to boycott @entity30 funding over their dealing of the situation ‘ we were given no press training and no support			2
@entity36 and i were thrown to the lions while they protected their reputation			2
we were used as an example but we were just children			0
‘ it did n’t happen during a tournament and it was n’t in a training block			0
tell me any 17 - year - old who does n’t have a beer once in a while ? if it had been affecting my tennis , then fair enough , but it was n’t			1
now i ’m tarnished with this bad girl reputation			0
’ miss @entity1 ’s father @entity78 , a property developer , was so appalled by the @entity30 ’s decision that he pulled @entity1 ’s equally promising younger brother @entity80 , then 13 , out of the @entity30 programme			1
he then sold the family home to fund their careers himself			0
when the @entity30 offered miss @entity1 funding again the following year , it was turned down on principle			1
the family continued its boycott until last year when @entity80 , now on the men ’s circuit , decided to accept @entity30 funding again – a move that has angered his father to the point where they are no longer on speaking terms			2
miss @entity1 said : ‘ it ’s a very touchy subject			1
@entity99 says he was trying to protect us , but now @entity80 is older and has to pay for tennis himself			0
it ’s a difficult family issue			0
i try to stay out of it			0
’ but she insists she will not follow her brother ’s example			0
‘ i do n’t want their money and now i have the prize money from @entity2 i do n’t need it , ’ she said			0
‘ i wo n’t be bought by them after everything that ’s happened			0
‘ i still to this day do n’t understand what we did wrong			0
if i want to have a night out then i will			2
if it ’s going to affect my tennis , then i wo n’t do it because tennis is my priority			0
‘ the @entity30 certainly were n’t trying to protect me			0
the @entity30 only wanted what was best for them			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity30 said : ‘ we have moved on and are glad that @entity1 is doing well on court			1
we wish her the very best			0
