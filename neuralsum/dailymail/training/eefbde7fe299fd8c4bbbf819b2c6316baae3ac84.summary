a @entity1 neighborhood is under siege by jackrabbits the size of small dogs			2
residents of the community in @entity8 awake each day to herds of up to 50 of the dead - eyed critters swarming area lawns and playgrounds like something out of a @entity15 film			1
while the jackrabbits , which can weigh as much as 9 pounds , gobble up gardens , lawns and even some trees , residents are at a loss about how to control them			1
' there 's at least 40 to 50 everyday , and they 're in our yards and by a children 's park			1
' @entity35 posted a photo to @entity50 in early december , around the time the jackrabbits first appeared , that showed countless paw prints in the snow outside her home alongside the sad remnants of some flower bushes			0
' can anyone tell that there have been a million rabbits eating all of our perennials this past week ? ' she wrote			0
@entity35 says she now sees some 50 of the jackrabbits at a time			2
when she contacted animal control , they said there was nothing they could do since they showed up , the rabbits have grown in numbers			0
and with their ability to have four litters per year of as many as nine offspring , their numbers will undoubtedly grow if nothing is done			1
@entity35 said she contacted local animal control department , who said there was nothing they could do			0
the hares , they said , are wild animals and not under their jurisdiction			1
however , the officials apparently were n't above doling out tips on how to control the hares			2
' i was told we should poison them , which i will absolutely not do , ' @entity35 told @entity93			0
in addition to the concern over laying poison near a playground , the jackrabbits are close to a dog park			0
original @entity101 clip like rabbits : the jackrabbits devour gardens and even trees and can reproduce up four times a year , producing litters with as many as nine offspring			1

a @entity8 community is visited by at least 50 of the critters , also known as wild hares , each day
the ravenous hares devour gardens , lawns and even trees and no one is sure what to do about the *problem*
some have *suggested* poisoning the hares , which reproduce two to four times per year and can have litters as large as nine
