a routine three points for @entity1 masked a serious issue for them – another day another diver			0
just before half time @entity6 broke into the penalty area and under the attention of @entity10 the @entity5 threw himself to the ground			2
it was definitely an attempt to win a penalty and get his side two goals ahead in the first half			0
i am surprised that @entity17 has not told his players to stay on their feet after dives from @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and others – but then unless they are consistently cautioned why should he ? @entity22 players , including the accused offender @entity10 , swarm around @entity6 after he hit the deck @entity6 presses his finger against the cheek of @entity10 as the striker takes exception to his actions @entity41 is held back by @entity10 's @entity22 team - mates as he comes in to support @entity6			1

@entity6 went down in the penalty area in the first half
the @entity1 defender *anticipated* @entity10 's *challenge*
@entity34 should have show @entity6 *yellow* card for simulation
@entity1 won 2 - 0 over @entity22 at @entity63 on @entity64
