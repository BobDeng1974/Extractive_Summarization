is it a bird ? is it a plane ? no , it 's @entity6 @entity5 's ' aerosail ' above the sea			1
@entity5 and his partners ' ambition is to create an innovative , efficient , and silent maritime vehicle , only using the wind as means of propulsion			0
by the end of october , the adventurer and researcher hopes to have crossed the @entity17 , from @entity18 to @entity19 on the island of @entity21			1
trial : @entity5 went for a practice run in @entity24 , southeastern @entity6 here 's hoping : @entity5 was in relaxed mood above the waters @entity28 unique principle of flight allows the user to pilot , like a sailboat , an airship linked by a cable to a stabilized keel , called the @entity35			2
the cable acts as the mast and the airship as the sail			0
and so @entity5 went for a practice run in @entity24 , southeastern @entity6 prior to his planned crossing			2
blown away : the @entity6 adventurer will be hoping it 's life off come october and his @entity17 challenge the giant balloon begins to take shape , and is connected to the @entity35 close eye : in case @entity5 gets into difficulty , the seaglider is on hand to rescue the situation back in 2008 @entity5 was forced to abandon a scheduled crossing of the @entity54 at the half - way point in his pedal - powered airship due to strong winds			1
he will be hoping for calmer conditions on his @entity17 challenge , otherwise there will only one winner in the man v the elements battle			0
smile : @entity5 gives the camera a wave as he perfects the final touches to his invention fingers crossed : if the wind remains mild , the airship can be guided by the pilot powering on : the aerosail on the landscape is a pretty sight			0

@entity5 's invention uses only the wind to *travel*
plans to fly from @entity18 in @entity6 to @entity19 on island of @entity21
uses the same principal as a sailboat , and connected by cables
*failed* in a 2008 *mission* to cross the @entity54
