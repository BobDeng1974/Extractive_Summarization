by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd having breezed through qualification from one of the @entity6 's toughest groups with a game to spare , @entity2 's squad were more than entitled to enjoy a day off in the sun ahead of their last - 16 game against @entity10			0
@entity11 and co have arguably been the tournament 's most impressive team : thrashing world champions @entity16 5 - 1 , beating @entity17 3 - 2 and finally seeing off @entity6 surprise package @entity19 2 - 0 to set themselves up for a favourable first knockout round draw			0
and with incoming @entity23 manager @entity22 already appearing to be adopting a laid back approach to the time off he gives his players in @entity26 , @entity23 fans will be hoping that the same happy atmosphere can be replicated when @entity29 returns to @entity30 with the new manager			2
watchful eye : @entity29 plays with his phone while @entity22 , in the foreground , watches from a distance easy street : @entity22 cooled off with a towel around his neck as the @entity40 squad left the swimming pool happy chap : @entity22 looked in good spirits as he stepped off the team coach of @entity45 's day off downtime : the @entity40 players spent time with their families after making it through to the knockout stages chilled out : the @entity40 players were joined by family and friends for some well - earned downtime @entity29 appeared to be unhappy under @entity54 - with @entity55 labelling his transformation under last season 's manager going from : ' the star man , our go - to guy , the top scorer , to being almost like a sideshow			1
' but with @entity22 replaced @entity54 in the @entity30 hotseat , the @entity40 striker , who will return to the side after suspension , should be seen smiling a lot more next season			0
the strong relationship beyond the two has been obvious since @entity45 's first game of the tournament - with captain @entity29 high - fiving @entity22 in one of the defining images of the @entity6 so far			1
@entity75 : @entity45 red duo : @entity29 and @entity22 will team up again after the @entity6 , but in red shirts rather than @entity78 manager - captain bond : @entity22 and @entity29 chat with each other during a training session break the @entity40 squad , and their manager , enjoyed their rest day by the pool with their families before stepping up their preparations for the game against @entity10			1
they will be the strong favourites to reach the quarter finals on sunday , with bookmakers @entity89 offering odds of 1/2 on them to qualify ahead of the @entity92 who finished second behind hosts @entity26 in @entity94 with @entity22 keeping his eye on his stars from a distance the @entity40 chatted with the fans while enjoying some snacks at the poolside			0
@entity102 's @entity101 even managed to escape to the beaches in @entity104 to spend some quality time with his girlfriend			2
@entity107 was n't too far from the mind though , with @entity29 leading his teammates in a game of head tennis			2
day off : @entity22 's squad have beaten @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity19 so far and now face @entity10 in the second round picture perfect : @entity29 plays some head tennis but quite does n't match his diving headed effort against @entity16 popular : fans , including one in a @entity23 shirt , grab a moment with @entity29 happy days : @entity29 shares a laugh with a fan - and it 's been a good tournament for him so far @entity45 started the tournament as rank outsiders but are now considered joint - fourth favourites behind @entity26 , @entity128 and fellow @entity130 @entity129			1
the hard work starts now though against @entity10 who are unbeaten so far and proved hard to beat for @entity26			0
@entity22 will undoubtedly be cooking up another plan to put off his starting the @entity23 job for a few more days			0
hot stuff : @entity101 and fiancee @entity137 take a walk on the beach in @entity104 on @entity45 's day off hot shots : @entity101 scored against @entity19 and was seen on the beach with his girlfriend on his day off is that a text from @entity146 ? @entity101 could be in line for a move away from the @entity102 after the @entity6			1

@entity11 enjoys a game of head tennis with his teammates
@entity29 seems to be *flourishing* under @entity22 's relaxed approach
@entity45 finished top of @entity157 with a perfect nine points
@entity22 will link up with his captain at @entity161
@entity101 hits the beach with his girlfriend in @entity104
