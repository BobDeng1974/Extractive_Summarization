by @entity0 a new housing boom could be on the way - with a relaxation of planning laws prompting a surge in the number of large housing estates being forced through by developers , a study claimed today			1
@entity11 ’s local authorities approved 195,000 planning applications over the past year , which is a 9 per cent rise on the average before legal changes came in promoting sustainable development			1
planning permission for large residential developments increased by a quarter from 4,000 in 2010/11 to 4,900 in 2013/14 – with a rise in the approval rate from 73 per cent to 77 per cent			1
building : planning permission for large residential developments increased by a quarter from 4,000 in 2010/11 to 4,900 in 2013/14 - with a rise in the approval rate from 73 per cent to 77 per cent ( file picture ) the figures come as a @entity28 peer said hundreds of thousands of homes must be built on 800 square miles of @entity31 countryside where there are ‘ big , open , flat fields of no agricultural merit ’			1
@entity35 of @entity36 said the government must allow construction on greenfield areas - and added that he does not believe the country is already over-developed			1
the 46 - year - old chief executive of retailer @entity42 said ‘ beautiful countryside ’ must be preserved , but the proportion of the @entity31 that has been developed should be increased from 8 per cent to 9 per cent			1
@entity35 told @entity45 : ‘ there is a lot of justifiable fear about development			1
people assume that there is very little countryside left which is n’t true			2
‘ when people say we need more land for homes they summon up the @entity56 and @entity57 in their imagination , and imagine it all ruined			2
and no - one wants that			0
‘ but equally there are lots of parts of the countryside where no one walks in – that are just big , open , flat fields of no agricultural merit			2
’ next chief executive : @entity35 of @entity36 said the government must allow construction on greenfield areas - and added that he does not believe the country is already over-developed he claimed that an extra 300,000 homes would add 3 per cent to the @entity31 ’s gross domestic product			1
@entity77 sites are found on derelict or disused land			0
they improve the appearance of these areas and are often found near towns or cities – so reduce the need for car use			0
but they are more expensive to build on - because the land often must be cleared first - and are more available in the @entity88 and @entity89 , despite the biggest housing demand being found in the @entity91			0
@entity93 sites are areas on which nothing has been previously constructed			0
they are praised for being cheaper to build on , but also mean the destruction of parts of the countryside and encourage road commuting			0
environmentalists also argue that they promote urban sprawl , which is the spread of an urban area into its surrounding countryside			0
@entity35 - who is married to @entity106 ’s economic adviser @entity105 - is seen as an ally of the chancellor , and his comments echo those of the prime minister last november			1
mr @entity112 said at the time that rural voters opposed to new planning rules were killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘ dream of home ownership ’			0
the prime minister accused grassroots conservatives and countryside groups that oppose building on greenfield land of putting their own interests before the country ’s			2
but a hard - hitting report two months ago claimed that rural towns and villages were being placed under siege by the threat of 700,000 new homes in the countryside			2
almost 200,000 of these are earmarked for supposedly protected @entity137 land thanks to the government 's changes to planning laws , the @entity134 warned			0
its report revealed that just 84 local authorities – a quarter of those outside @entity143 – propose to prioritise building on brownfield sites			1
lord @entity35 ’s @entity42 has taken some of its 540 @entity31 stores out of town to industrial estates over the past decade			1
@entity150 : @entity35 said ' beautiful countryside ' must be preserved , but the proportion of the @entity31 that has been developed should be increased from 8 per cent to 9 per cent ( file picture ) in 2012 it was claimed that the company was the fifth top retail park tenant in the @entity31 , measured by the total area occupied - behind @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
the study on planning figures by construction industry analysts @entity165 published in the @entity45 comes following the launch of @entity168 planning reforms			2
' there are lots of parts of the countryside where no one walks in – that are just big , open , flat fields of no agricultural merit ' lord @entity35 @entity134 chief executive @entity176 told @entity177 : ‘ @entity35 is a businessman who has come to hate the planning system because it stops him plonking big retail sheds in the countryside on the edge of towns			1
‘ now he says he wants to preserve a few beauty spots , but he clearly has no sense of the richness of the “ ordinary ” countryside that people love so much			0
that ’s a great pity , but he should not be allowed to impose his aesthetic limitations – or his disdain for farming – on the rest of us			0
‘ of course the country needs many more homes , particularly affordable homes , and some of those will have to go on greenfield sites			2
‘ but let ’s start by developing the thousands of brownfield sites now lying derelict across the country			0
that will not only save the countryside from being eaten away			0
it will also vastly improve our towns and cities , and make them better places to live			0
