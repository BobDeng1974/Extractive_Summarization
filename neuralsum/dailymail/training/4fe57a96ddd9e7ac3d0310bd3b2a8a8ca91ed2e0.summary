@entity0 faces @entity10 @entity9 while @entity3 is preparing for @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
@entity3 is confident he will be given the more high - profile slot at @entity15 ’s @entity14 – ‘ @entity16 ’m sure has been told an awful lot of stuff throughout his career , and he ’s waiting for someone to start telling him the truth ... @entity22 ’s telling me he ’s not gon na be ( chief support ) ’ – leaving @entity0 to respond that @entity3 has felt ‘ in his shadow ’ since they first met			1
“ i go on ringside , i 'm a @entity38 fighter and this guy is sitting beside me telling me he is chief support ? what the f * * * ? ‘ basically we were going back and forth and the ugly kid was moaning but i do n't care			1
all i care about is what i 'm getting paid that night and getting the win			2
‘ he has never liked me because he has always been in my shadow			1
it started the day he came in the club			2
i 'll tell you the truth , i was basically the main boy at the club – the golden boy really – i was there before him and then he was always chasing behind me			2
@entity3 insists his fight against @entity55 will be afforded the chief support slot next week ‘ obviously i won national titles and all that and then he beat me on a majority decision as an amateur			1
he should n't have won but it does n't matter and then me going to the @entity61 killed him			2
‘ i used to batter him ( in sparring )			0
he was a couple of years younger than me			0
we have never been friends really			0
you know when you go to the gym you have a couple of mates and that ? well i used to go in there , do my work and come out			0
we 've never ever been friends			0

their fight for the @entity75 super middleweight title , when @entity3 narrowly outpointed @entity0 in may 2011 , was among the most hyped domestic fights in recent years but @entity0 believes that was his making and that @entity3 owes him as a consequence			1
both @entity3 and @entity0 are on the undercard to @entity8 's ( left , in 2011 ) bout with @entity7 ‘ he should be grateful to me , 100 per cent , ’ he said			1
‘ why should i be grateful to him ? he should be grateful to me because i made him			0
‘ when we turned professional , i came back as olympic gold medallist and all of a sudden the talk straight away was ' @entity85 beat him as an amateur ' all stuff like that			0
