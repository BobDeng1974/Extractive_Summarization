she will announce a £ 5million fund to help state schools offer debating competitions , sports coaching , theatre productions and musical instrument tuition			1
the scheme is intended to help equip state school pupils with the values and character traits needed to succeed in the workplace and compete with youngsters educated at private schools			1
mrs @entity23 wants to build on reforms to the school curriculum to ensure that youngsters also receive a broad education and develop wider skills			2
schools will be encouraged to offer debating , sport , drama and other clubs at lunchtimes and after - school to instil attributes such as resilience , perseverance and the ability to work in teams			1
the @entity39 is already encouraging schools to consider offering longer days to allow pupils to take part in extra-curricular activities and complete homework under supervision			1
mrs @entity23 will today host a roundtable event with key figures from business and charities to discuss how schools can develop a child ’s character			2
she will also hold up examples of state schools already excelling in character education			1
they include @entity57 , in @entity58 , @entity59 , which offers more than 100 after - school classes ranging from extra @entity61 and maths to an orchestra , choir and debating club			2
in a dramatic turnaround , the school has won an ‘ outstanding ’ @entity69 rating having been among the worst in the country just over two years ago			0
principal dr @entity71 says the introduction of a broad range of extra-curricular activities has been instrumental in the school ’s success			2
meanwhile @entity77 21 , a free school in @entity78 , east @entity79 , has identified 21 qualities as attributes of a successful student and provides leadership and debating classes to enhance pupil ’s assertiveness and public speaking skills			2
with a tough new curriculum being implemented in schools this academic year , mrs @entity23 now wants to emphasise the role schools can play in equipping pupils with broader skills and attributes			0
announcing the £ 5million fund , mrs @entity23 said : ‘ our plan for education is to ensure all young people leave school prepared for life in modern @entity101			0
that means not only ensuring that young people learn core academic skills and knowledge , but also that they develop the values and attributes to succeed in employment , further study and later life			0
‘ that ’s why i want all children to experience the type of activities which develop character and resilience , both in and beyond the classroom			0
‘ whether it is the teamwork and resilience that come from playing sport , the dedication and perseverance it takes to learn an instrument or the confidence and self - expression which they may find on the stage , the fund will mean every child has the opportunity to receive a broad and balanced education			0
’ mrs @entity23 's predecessor @entity131 said he wanted debating , orchestra and drama clubs to be for state as well as private schools in a speech earlier this year the fund will be mainly targeted at schools in disadvantaged areas			1
it will also cover career and mentoring schemes , which are said to help prepare children for the transition into adult life			0
mrs @entity23 ’s predecessor @entity131 had already outlined an aspiration to raise standards in state schools to the point where they are indistinguishable from private schools , including the range of extra-curricular activities on offer			1
in a speech earlier this year , mr @entity131 said : ‘ i want to see state schools in @entity61 the best in the world			1
' state schools where the vast majority of pupils have the grades and the skills to apply to university , if they want to ; where a state pupil being accepted to @entity164 is not a cause for celebration , but a matter of course ; where it is the norm for state pupils to enjoy brilliant extra-curricular activities like sports , orchestras , cadets , choir , drama , debating , the @entity179 scheme , and more			1
‘ all those things are par for the course in the private sector – why should n’t children in the state sector enjoy them ? ’ a subsequent report from a cross-party parliamentary group insisted that @entity101 ’s schools must be ‘ more than just exam factories ’			2
it argued that schools should make it part of their ‘ core business ’ to nurture pupils ’ self - belief , perseverance and ability to bounce back from set - backs			0
among the guests at today ’s roundtable is baroness @entity201 , chair of the @entity202 , who said : ‘ i am a firm believer that @entity204 and school sport , when taught and delivered well , can help young people develop greater resilience			0
‘ at the @entity202 , we use the power of sport to develop young people ’s confidence and self - esteem which are critically important to success - academically , in employment and throughout life			0
