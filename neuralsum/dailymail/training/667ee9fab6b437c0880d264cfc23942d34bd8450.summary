@entity1 and @entity2 have both enjoyed blistering starts to @entity6 life - or rebirth in the case of @entity2 - even if their clubs have had differing fortunes			1
@entity1 , 26 , has been a perpetually bright light in a @entity12 side that has struggled for consistency , while @entity2 ’ stylish and energetic displays have helped lift @entity16 three points clear at the top of the table			1
the form of both , particularly @entity1 , is likely to determine the outcome when their sides meet at @entity25 on sunday in an encounter that will pit two of the world ’s best midfielders against each other			1
at £ 59.7million , recruited from @entity47 , @entity1 broke the record @entity49 transfer fee and @entity2 was no snip either , at £ 26.3m from @entity51			2
but with so much at stake for both clubs - they could prove to be relative bargain buys			0
@entity1 , who suffered a knock in monday night ’s 2 - 2 draw with @entity38 , is expected to be fit for sunday			1
that will be music to the ears of @entity60 , who faces the biggest examination of his spell at @entity25 so far			0
with the @entity12 defence error prone , confidence shorn and likely to be exploited by @entity16 ’s world class strike force , @entity60 ’s side will probably have to carve a result from their own attacking brilliance			1
thus far , @entity1 has outshone his talented team - mates , @entity71 and @entity72 by contributing three goals and four assists in his six appearances			0
he has been the focal point of the @entity12 attack , creating space for himself in order to feed dangerous balls to his team - mates , as he did when assisting @entity83 ’s brilliant equaliser on monday			0
@entity1 is replaced by @entity84 after picking up an injury during @entity12 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity38 @entity1 ( third left ) is expected to start against @entity16 on sunday despite picking up a knock against @entity38 fabregas shoots and scores for @entity16 in their 2 - 1 win over @entity33 earlier this month @entity2 celebrates with @entity91 ( left ) and his been tipped to succeed him as @entity16 captain he is adding sparkle and polish to a unit that has looked a bit dull at times			1
if he can inspire @entity12 to an unlikely victory over @entity16 , he will pay off another hefty installment of his transfer fee			2
@entity2 , meanwhile , has impressed @entity100 so much he is even hinting that the @entity101 could be a ready successor to @entity91 as @entity103 ’ captain			0
former @entity105 star @entity2 was man of the match on his @entity16 debut against @entity108 in august and has propelled his side forward ever since			2
he has added versatility and attacking vigour that @entity16 were perhaps missing last season , providing more assists than any other player in the league			0
undoubtedly one of the world ’s best creative players , he could spot a pass while blindfolded and has the deftness of touch to execute it perfectly			0
versatile and quick thinking , he not only provides impeccable service to danger man @entity125 but brings @entity126 and @entity127 into play			0
@entity1 avoids the challenge of @entity130 ( left ) and @entity131 ( right ) @entity2 ( centre ) was involved in a bust - up with @entity33 players after @entity135 was sent off @entity2 hailed the ‘ connection ’ between the three of them after they exchanged several passes in the build up to his first league goal of the season against @entity33 last week			2
it is a coup for the @entity6 to have @entity1 and @entity2 on the same pitch on sunday and we are likely to get some indication as to which of these imports from @entity150 is more valuable			1
@entity151 9 @entity1 8 the @entity12 man loses possession more frequently that his @entity16 counterpart @entity155 9 @entity1 9 both players are invariably at the heart of their team 's good moves @entity160 9 as a natural winger , @entity1 deliveries into the box are so dangerous @entity164 8 @entity165 may have only scored once this season but both men are dangerous in front of goal @entity170 5 neither man is known for their tackling - an area they both could improve in @entity175 9 @entity1 9 both have fitted into new tactical systems with ease and real willingness @entity180 9 @entity1 7 @entity2 has been mentioned as a future @entity16 captain and edges this one @entity183 9 when @entity1 gets the ball and starts motoring , there are few better than him in the world @entity188 7 both men put a shift in but @entity1 has is still adapting to the intensity of the @entity6 @entity192 9 @entity1 8 @entity2 edges this one with his ability to control a game from start to finish @entity196 79/100			1

@entity2 and @entity1 arrived in the @entity6 this *summer*
both midfielders have proved *crucial* to their side 's attacking play
@entity12 take on @entity16 at @entity25 on sunday
@entity1 expected to play despite picking up a knock against @entity38
