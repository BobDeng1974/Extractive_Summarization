the words in her son ’s homework left @entity4 numb with shock			2
in a letter which began ‘ dear mum ’ , @entity15 , 14 , assured her he loved her , made a request for bright colours at his funeral , and listed who should inherit his most prized possessions			1
horrified , she ran to his bedroom praying he had not taken his own life			2
@entity21 , with the emotional goodbye note , pictured with his mother @entity23 in fact , @entity15 was sleeping soundly in bed – and the death note turned out to be the result of a creative writing assignment set by his teachers			1
last night his parents demanded an apology from the school , furious that teachers could have set such a piece of work without informing them			1
but while the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , apologised , staff insist the task was justified as an exercise in ‘ expressive art ’ and an opportunity for pupils to tell their mothers that they love them			1
the school said it would ‘ review how we communicate to parents in the future ’			1
mrs @entity4 , 42 , and her husband @entity51 described the horrifying moment they read the note at their home in @entity56 , @entity39 and thought their son might be about to commit suicide			1
mr @entity21 , 52 , a warehouse worker , said : ‘ @entity15 came down before going to bed and handed his mum this piece of paper			1
creative note : @entity21 , 14 , was asked to write a letter as if he only had a few days left to live when @entity23 read the note written by her son , pictured , she thought he was going to take his own life ‘ he said goodnight and then off he went back upstairs to bed			1
‘ @entity23 read it – and the colour just drained from her face			2
she just froze stiff and handed me this paper with her hands shaking			2
‘ she burst into his bedroom and expected to see him hanging there – she was horrified			2
the poor lad almost jumped out of his skin			2
it really has shaken us up			0
’ @entity15 was set the task last month in his @entity84 , a subject – also offered at @entity86 – which aims to ‘ develop pupils ’ creativity and imagination ’			0
' distressing ' : @entity15 wrote in his creative writing exercise that he was ' writing to say goodbye ' children were asked to imagine they had a terminal illness and express thanks to loved ones			1
@entity15 said : ‘ i just thought it was like any other piece of work			0
i just got on with it			0
’ in the letter , which is littered with spelling errors , he asked family and friends to wear bright colours at his funeral and apologised for being ‘ a pain ’ at times			0
‘ i do n’t want you to be sad , ’ it said			0
‘ i ’m with @entity109 and @entity110 now so i love you and goodbye			0
’ pupils were then told to take the letters home but no warning was given to parents about the notes			1
creative : the @entity38 in @entity39 apologised for any distress caused by the exercise , but claimed many parents had seen it as ' valuable ' ‘ i could n’t believe the school did not warn us they were doing such a sick exercise , ’ mr @entity21 said			1
‘ they could have written something on top of the work			0
’ he added that the assignment could have been harmful to vulnerable teens			0
‘ it could give some kids the wrong ideas , ’ he said			0
mrs @entity4 , a teaching assistant , added : ‘ @entity15 is a lively boy and to see this made me think there was something seriously wrong			0
’ last night the school said many parents and pupils found the exercise ‘ valuable ’ , adding that it was in line with the national curriculum			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the purpose was to enable young people to explore their feelings and emotions and celebrate the many good things with their loved ones that are usually left unsaid			0

@entity21 , 14 , told to write ' expressive ' note in creative writing class
his parents brand exercise ' sick ' and ' *inappropriate* '
