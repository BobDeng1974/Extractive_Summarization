by @entity0 , @entity1 the entry of a 12th team into @entity4 for next season is still under consideration by motor sport 's world governing body the @entity7			1
early in december the @entity7 announced it was seeking expressions of interest from potential new entrants			0
@entity12 , one half of the successful @entity15 team that competes in the @entity17 series , has long been the favourite to be given the slot			2
ready to go : @entity20 believes the entrant made by @entity17 team owner @entity12 will be accepted @entity22 supremo @entity20 certainly believes that will be the case as he said : ' i think @entity12 will be accepted			1
' speaking to @entity26 , @entity20 added : ' they have got the money , but it 's a question of whether they are going to spend it			2
' the @entity7 was due to make a decision by the end of february , but is yet to make any official announcement			0
the matter remains under consideration , although it is expected it will soon be resolved			0
@entity12 certainly has the credentials and capability to get a new team up and running , notably as he owns factory facilities in @entity41 which would likely be key for a @entity43 base			2
owner : @entity12 has long been the favourite to be given the slot across the pond : @entity48 celebrates winning the inaugural @entity50 @entity49 in @entity51 in 2012 @entity55 @entity54 @entity53 @entity52 @entity12 also runs the full - scale @entity57 rolling - road wind tunnel in @entity58 that has previously been used by a number of @entity4 teams			1
former @entity55 and @entity62 technical director @entity61 is known to be working with @entity12 on the project			0
the @entity50 last tried to get a team on the grid in 2010 at a time when @entity22 was seeking significant expansion , only for @entity22 's plans to fail to come to fruition			1
@entity20 , however , has warned @entity12 the start - up costs are significant , adding : ' a billion would last a new team owner four years			1
' i 've spoken to @entity12 , but i do n't know what they are going to do			0
it 's @entity50 , so i do n't know			0

@entity22 supremo @entity20 believes the @entity50 team ' will be accepted '
the @entity50 **constructor** would be the 12th *outfit* on the @entity4 grid
@entity17 team owner @entity12 will run the @entity50 **constructor**
@entity20 has warned the start - up costs would be *$* *1billion* over four years
