the controversial double - points system introduced into @entity1 for the past season has been abandoned after just one year			1
and the sport is set for a potentially record - breaking 21 - race schedule in 2015 with the @entity6 surprisingly re-emerging on the calendar			1
earlier this year a record - equalling 20 - grand prix calendar was unveiled , matching the exhausting number of events set in 2012			0
but following a meeting of the @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , it has emerged there may now be 21 races next year			0
@entity18 won the last @entity6 held in 2013 - while at @entity19 the @entity13 ratified a decision taken to scrap double points following a meeting of the @entity23 in @entity24 last week			1
the scheme was introduced at the behest of supremo @entity27 in an effort to prolong the life of a championship and attract high television audiences through to the final race			1
@entity27 's original concept was for the final three races to carry double points , but it was decided at last year 's meeting of the @entity13 the system would only be employed for the closing grand prix			0
upon its announcement the decision was greeted with overwhelming condemnation by fans , whilst drivers past and present also voiced their disapproval			0
2014 world champion @entity44 will be looking to record his first win at the @entity46 @entity6 mar 15 - @entity47 mar 29 - @entity48 apr 12 - @entity49 apr 19 - @entity50 may 3 - @entity46 ( @entity51 ) may 10 - @entity52 may 24 - @entity53 jun 7 - @entity54 jun 21 - @entity55 jul 5 - @entity56 jul 19 - @entity57 jul 26 - @entity58 aug 23 - @entity59 sep 6 - @entity60 sep 20 - @entity61 sep 27 - @entity62 oct 11 - @entity63 oct 25 - @entity64 nov 1 - @entity65 nov 15 - @entity66 nov 29 - @entity67 the recent campaign would still have gone to the wire with the final race in @entity67 even if there had been no double points on offer			1
@entity44 , however , could have lost the title on double points to @entity77 team - mate @entity76 if a certain set of circumstances had unfolded			1
mercifully for @entity80 he emerged victorious , claiming his 11th win of the year , and with it his second world championship			2
following a four - year run after its debut in 2010 , the @entity83 - staged in @entity86 at the southern tip of @entity46 - dropped off the calendar for this season due to a lack of funds and poor attendances			1
it was suggested at the time the race would be unlikely to make a return , but it has been given a ‘ to be confirmed ’ date of may 3 , just a week ahead of the @entity52 @entity6			1
a minor tweak to the start of the calendar sees @entity48 now a stand - alone race on march 29 rather than back to back with @entity50			2
the race at the @entity101 circuit is now on april 19 and twinned with @entity49 , which will be staged a week before on april 12			2
given the teams had previously complained about @entity61 - @entity62 being back to back in september , and that has been retained , it is unlikely they will wear the prospect of four grands prix in five weekends across april and may , with @entity46 now shoehorned in			2
@entity44 is paraded in front of the world 's media after celebrating his 2014 world championship triumph following the @entity13 's meeting in @entity15 capital @entity14 , it has also been decided there will be no standing restarts behind the safety car			1
the @entity117 voted in the idea earlier this year , but following a thorough review of the potential difficulties that , too , has been axed			0
the @entity13 has agreed , however , to the introduction of the ' virtual safety car ' ( @entity123 ) which was successfully piloted at the end of practice sessions at recent grands prix			0
@entity127 suffered a life - threatening accident at the @entity62 @entity6 in early october the system arose following @entity127 's accident at the @entity62 @entity6 in early october , with the @entity131 still in hospital in @entity133 as he recovers from severe head injuries			2
the @entity135 quickly reviewed how best to control a driver 's speed during incidents where a safety car is not required , deciding the @entity123 , where a speed limit is imposed around the track , to be the ideal solution			0
a statement from the @entity13 read : ' following tests of the @entity123 system at the final events of 2014 the introduction of the system has been approved for 2015			0
' the @entity123 procedure may be initiated to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course			0
' it will normally be used when double - waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and competitors or officials may be in danger , but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself			0

@entity46 @entity6 will be the fifth race of the season on may 3
2015 @entity1 campaign begins in @entity47 on march 15
@entity77 ' @entity44 won the @entity170 ' championship
