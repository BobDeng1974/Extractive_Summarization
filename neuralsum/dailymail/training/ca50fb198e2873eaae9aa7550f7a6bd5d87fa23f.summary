by @entity0 polar air sweeping down from @entity2 is causing heavy downpours and bringing record - breaking cold weather in parts of the @entity6			1
a massive southern dip in the jet stream is forcing cold air from the @entity10 as far south as @entity11 , and will bring daytime highs of no more than @entity13 and overnight lows of just 4c to parts of the @entity16 in the early half of this week			1
yesterday the city of @entity20 , @entity18 saw a midday high of @entity22 accompanied by a bitter 20mph wind at a time of year when temperatures would usually be in the high 20s or low 30s			1
this stunning photograph was taken from a vantage point in @entity37 , @entity38 floods : a car is seen driving through a flooded street in @entity42			0
several inches of rain fell in just a few hours in the area over the weekend , with temperatures plummeting as a result of the cold air being forced into the @entity6 from the @entity10 temperatures across parts of eastern and central @entity6 will be more reminiscent of late october or early november this week , as the dip in the jet stream forces cold @entity10 air much deeper into the country than it normally would			1
according to the @entity59 , the weather in @entity18 's @entity57 and @entity58 - was record - breakingly cold yesterday			1
with a high of just @entity62 , yesterday 's cold weather smashed the @entity64 ' previous record for a july 14 temperature			1
the previous july 14 record of @entity67 had stood for an astonishing 130 years , since 1884			2
despite the poor weather conditions it is not , however , the second coming of a polar vortex , a phrase the @entity59 's @entity42 office tweeted earlier this week to describe the upcoming sweater weather			2
they quickly learned that was n't such a good idea , said @entity78 , a weather service meteorologist who spent a good chunk of friday morning fielding a flood of telephone calls from the media			0
' i think people are pretty sensitive to those words , ' she said			0
divide : the current cold weather in the @entity6 has its roots in an @entity90 typhoon			2
though @entity92 has weakened since hitting @entity93 , it altered the path of the @entity96 jet stream , allowing polar air behind a trough of low pressure to spill out of @entity2 and into the @entity16			1
the cold air has , however , forced warm winds from @entity102 much further north than usual , leaving cities such as @entity104 on the @entity105 basking in the mid- 30s under water : several grave sites at the @entity108 rest under water after a severe thunderstorm dumped several inches of rain and strong winds in @entity114 , @entity115 over the weekend			2
the area is experiencing extreme weather thanks to disruption in the @entity96 jet stream ruined : a woman searches through her flood home in @entity121 , @entity115 after a heavy rain storm swept through the area the current cold weather in the @entity6 has its roots in a @entity90 typhoon			1
though @entity92 has weakened since hitting @entity93 , it altered the path of the @entity96 jet stream , allowing polar air behind a trough of low pressure to spill out of @entity2 and into the @entity16			1
in the early half of this week , temperatures in the @entity16 will be as much as 15 degrees cooler than normal , with the biggest drops seen close to the @entity133 , though people in @entity135 and @entity136 will feel the chill as well			0
the @entity96 jet stream , which is also known as the polar jet stream , is a fast flowing narrow air current which has a significant impact on the weather in @entity90 , @entity141 and @entity142			1
although it is usually stable and relatively easy to predict , typhoons or severe storms - most frequently in @entity90 - can easily disrupt the flow , causing the sort of extreme weather currently hitting @entity141			0
the cold weather in much of the country is in stark contrast to the @entity152 however , where temperatures will actually be significantly higher than usual - again caused by the disruption to the @entity96 jet stream			1
@entity104 , where summers are typically warm but rarely scorching , will see daytime highs in the mid to upper 30s as the week goes on			0
clean - up : a city worker for @entity121 in @entity115 helps to reinforce a bridge by dumping dirt into the areas where damage occurred during a massive storm in the area yesterday			0
@entity115 is just one of a number of states suffering the consequences of disruption to the @entity96 jet stream this back garden in @entity172 , @entity115 was inundated with flood water when the creek next to the property burst its banks			2
the flooding only stopped short of the house on the creekside ( left ) , because sand bags were put there during similar floods last summer meanwhile visitors to the @entity183 are hiking more cautiously after lightning strikes at the popular park killed two people in two days at the height of summer travel season			0
signs around the park warn its three million annual visitors that storms can close in quickly with deadly results but the areas had n't seen a lightning fatality in 14 years until last week			0
@entity197 , 42 , of @entity198 , @entity199 , was killed and seven more hikers were injured on the @entity201 at about 11,400 feet above sea level			0
one day later and a few miles away , lightning killed @entity204 , 52 , of @entity205 , @entity206 , at @entity207 , a pullout on @entity209 with sweeping vistas from a vantage point about 10,800 feet above sea level			0
three others were hurt by that strike .			0

massive southern dip in jet stream forcing cold air down from @entity219 down into central @entity6
overnight temperatures as low as @entity222 felt as far south as @entity11 and as far west as @entity223 and @entity206
cold weather caused by @entity92 , which hit @entity93 last week and disrupted @entity96 jet stream
yesterday a midday high of just @entity62 broke a 130 - year - old record for @entity18 's coldest ever july 14
