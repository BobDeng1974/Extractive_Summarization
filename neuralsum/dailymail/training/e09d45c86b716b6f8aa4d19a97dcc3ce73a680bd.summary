however only one of them intends to seek out their sperm donor father			1
a twist of fate brought them together at college in @entity30 @entity6 first made contact with @entity8 last summer while searching for a possible roommate on @entity33			1
the girls had a lot in common but their paths never really crossed at the @entity30 school			1
@entity6 told @entity38 on the today show : ' we did n't know each other that well , we could be really compatible as friends but we were never in the right place at the right time but we 've definitely got a lot closer recently			2
' they figured out that they were conceived by a donation from an anonymous donor after @entity6 posted a @entity33 message about her upbringing			2
but neither thought much of it , even when they figured out that both of their donors were @entity57			0
@entity6 said today : ' i thought '' would n't it be funny if we were sisters ? '' ' @entity6 's lesbian mothers @entity62 and @entity63 used an anonymous sperm donor to have their daughter two decades ago			1
what are the chances ! @entity8 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) met during their freshman year at @entity7 and discovered they shared the same sperm donor father when the girls went home for winter break , @entity6 told her moms about her new friend with whom she had so much in common			1
they urged her to compare her donor identification number with @entity8 - and the incredible discovery was made			2
@entity8 told @entity38 : ' i panicked ... i absolutely freaked out ... i started running around the house screaming and telling everyone , calling everyone			2
' @entity6 added : ' it was mind - blowing , i did n't know what to do			0
' following the life - changing realization , their bond has become much more intense			0
@entity6 said : ' we see each other multiple times a day now			0
we 're a lot closer			0
' the first time we saw each other [ since finding out ] , we did n't really know what to do			0
but we became best friends because that 's what we would have done even if we were n't sisters			0
' @entity8 added : ' there was a moment at dinner when i said '' i do n't know your favorite color or anything about you ''			0
we 've been catching up			0
' i already tell her i love her after two weeks			0
' surprise sisters : biological half - sisters @entity6 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) are both @entity9 attending @entity7 the girls said it was cool to get more family along with a new sister and the two sets of parents were already hanging out with each other			1
the one thing that the girls differ on is their attitude to finding their sperm donor father			1
@entity8 says that she has absolutely no interest in meeting him but would like to find out what he looks like			2
but @entity6 said that said that since she was little , she has been curious about finding out more about him - but for now is happy with the sister she happened on by chance			2
