by @entity0 published : 12:27 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 12:44 est , 3 january 2014 the @entity3 collection contains some of the world ’s most precious natural specimens and historical artefacts , from prehistoric fossils to @entity9 ’s life mask and @entity11 ’s air suit , but it is impossible to put them all on display			1
now the museums have embarked on an ambitious project to catalogue important pieces from their collections in @entity19 and you can browse exhibits online from the comfort of your armchair			1
the @entity26 collection features objects that highlight different applications of @entity19 capture and printing , and it is envisioned that the archived digital items will be used for research , education and conservation			1
scroll down for 3d models the @entity26 collection features objects from the @entity3 collection that highlight different applications of @entity19 capture and printing , including a cosmic @entity40			1
the statue is covered in low - relief etching that can be most clearly seen using 3d scanning technology objects among those scanned in @entity19 are a woolly mammoth fossil and the @entity47 , which is the first successful powered aircraft , designed and built by the @entity49 , who flew it four times in december 1903 in @entity53			2
the scan of the aircraft allows users to explore the fine details of the artefact , so they have a new way of understanding the principles of flight without visiting the @entity61 in @entity62 a @entity40 , on show at the @entity64 , also in @entity62 , enables people to see the amazing relief etchings , of which scholars have traditionally made rubbings to study			2
the @entity3 has embarked on an ambitious project to catalogue important pieces from the collections in @entity19 that can be accessed online , including @entity11 's air suit ( left ) and a life mask of @entity75 ( right ) like all fully enlightened beings , the life - size limestone figure is wrapped in the simple robe of a monk , but what makes the exhibit exceptional is the narrative scenes that cover its surface , which are based upon the lives of the historical @entity40			1
experts said 3d scanning alongside other imaging techniques , can give more clarity to the designs			0
to capture the detail of a large whale fossil , @entity3 palaeontologists documented skeletons from a site in @entity97 ’s @entity96 to get data about the arrangement and condition of the skeletons before they were removed			2
the @entity103 explorer contains a number of tools for examining the objects so that users can rotate exhibits , such as the @entity110 ’s @entity109 , take measurements and adjust colour and lighting to see detail as well as possible			1
the @entity103 explorer contains a number of tools for examining the objects so that users can rotate exhibits , such as the @entity110 's @entity109 , take measurements and adjust colour and lighting to see detail as well as possible the iconic mammal of the @entity122 which went extinct 10,000 years ago can be viewed in @entity19			1
the scan of the composite skeleton allows scientists to study the biomechanics and palaeobiology of very large mammals , whose bones are cumbersome and logistically difficult to manipulate in real life			0
the 3d model of @entity139 - born @entity11 ’s flight suit allows people to look inside to see the manufacturer , @entity132 , @entity133 & @entity134 , of @entity135 and @entity136 ’s label			0
ms @entity11 became the first woman to cross the @entity143 by plane i 1928 , accompanying pilot @entity145 in a @entity147 tri-motor from @entity148 to @entity149			0
in 1932 she flew alone , from @entity148 to @entity150 and earned worldwide acclaim by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the @entity143			0
a scan of @entity153 - a research site on the @entity155 , @entity156			0
the fossil species homo floresiensisathe ahobbita was discovered there in 2003 and @entity3 archaeologists have been excavating the cave since 2010 to understand more about the time a copy of a cast of @entity9 ’s gaunt face that was taken a day before his 56th birthday by sculptor @entity166 , has been recorded with a 3d scanner			2
life masks were popular in the @entity169 and throughout the @entity75 wanted to make himself visible to the @entity172 people and show how the war had aged and tired him			0
a ‘ storytelling ’ feature on the website means that visitors to the website can take guided tours of objects with @entity3 curators			2
objects among those scanned in @entity19 are a @entity186 mammoth fossil and the @entity47 ( pictured ) , which is the first successful powered aircraft , designed and built by the @entity49 , who flew it four times in december 1903 in @entity53 @entity191 , the director of the @entity193 ’s @entity192 said the 3d technology is being used to make museum collections and scientific specimens more widely available for anyone to use and study			2
‘ @entity103 explorer and the initial objects we scanned are the first step in showing how this technology will transform the work of the @entity3 and other museums and research institutions , ’ he said			1
the @entity3 collection comprises 137million objects , artworks and specimens and capturing the entire collection in @entity19 at a rate of one item every minute would take over 260 years if experts worked around the clock			1
the scan gives an insight into the excavation of a whale fossil from @entity219 , a palaeontological site in @entity97			0
smithsonian experts captured vital data about the arrangement and condition of the skeletons discovered before they were moved the group of museums aim to digitalise 10 per cent of their collections , just one per cent of which are on display to the public			0
the project will enable people to examine rare archived items they have never been able to see before , which will also benefit scientists and researchers			1
a 3d scan of @entity238 's gun			0
the explorer of @entity240 was not a skilled shooter and missed a lion , resulting in his arm being mauled , before his assistant felled the @entity247 gun in this model is not that same shotgun , but it was @entity238 's at the time of his death from dysentery in 1873			0

@entity3 has embarked on an ambitious project to catalogue important pieces in @entity19 for scientists and the general public to access online
the digital items will be used for research , education and conservation
