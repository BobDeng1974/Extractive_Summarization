last week this column ventured the view that @entity3 cricket was in denial			0
so we need to be careful how we tread after a 266 - run win over @entity7 at the @entity8 that was so complete it lacked only the sight of @entity11 publicly forgiving @entity12 for whatever it was that happened in the @entity17 pavilion three weeks ago			1
the good news for @entity19 is the bleeding has been staunched , and several of the themes that contributed to the mood of self - denial have been remedied – not least the response of the senior players , the runs of @entity27 , his use of @entity30 ’s off - breaks , and the wicketkeeper			1
the curmudgeonly news is that @entity7 appeared to have left their heads and hearts at @entity36 , a result that – if they are not careful – will leave them misty - eyed for longer than it takes to complete the series at @entity41 and the @entity42			1
what a relief : @entity19 , including captain @entity27 ( second left ) celebrate on the way to victory @entity7 were not merely poor in @entity46			1
from the moment @entity49 went on the defensive on the first afternoon , they conveyed to @entity19 an interest in damage limitation only			1
and , offered the chance to trample all over @entity49 ’s hospitality – a trait well - known to @entity58 fans during their @entity60 ’s three - year drought away from home – @entity19 quietly thanked him			1
the upshot of both that , and @entity11 ’s obliging drop at third slip when @entity27 had 15 – the kind of moment that can change a career – was that each of @entity19 ’s seniors made the impact demanded of them in advance			1
@entity27 ’s double of 95 and 70 not out recalled the salad days when he would tuck into buffet seam bowling for fun ( @entity78 and @entity79 are skilful operators , but they look knackered )			2
somehow , @entity7 bowled @entity19 ’s run machine back into form			1
@entity83 , spared a first - innings duck by @entity7 ’s continued refusal to countenance the @entity86 ( of which more below ) , late - cut as if this was the 2013 ashes all over again			1
then there was @entity89 and @entity12 , sharing eight wickets in the first innings , before @entity12 took control once more on the final morning			2
their confidence stemmed in part from the 569 for seven @entity19 racked up with the help of @entity7 ’s fatalism in the field			1
such things are all part of the jigsaw			0
with the four oldies all chipping in , the youngsters were able to go about their business , unencumbered by the concern that everything depended on them – like children trying to hold things together in a divorce			0
@entity112 could be removed only by umpiring error , @entity111 battered a second - innings 50 from 38 balls , @entity110 chanced his arm gloriously and assuaged fears about his ability with the gloves , and @entity30 looked suspiciously frontline rather than part - time			2
encouraging though this all is , the fact remains that @entity19 have won only one of their last @entity124 , and could still lose a home series to a team that travels less well than camembert			2
some of their dominance at the @entity8 was down to the opposition			2
jumping for joy : man of the match @entity12 was one of the senior players who backed up the captain for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin as for @entity27 ’s captaincy , which – more than his batting – persuaded this column to suggest he was no longer up to the job , it drew on his runs like an old friend feeds off another after months of separation			1
suddenly , we were marvelling at the fielding and bowling changes – the hunch on @entity111 that produced the wicket of @entity150 on wednesday evening , and the gully brought in moments before @entity78 was caught there on thursday morning			0
such can be the nature of leadership			0
@entity27 did not suddenly wake up a tactical genius – and his hopes of victory in this series could depend on how well the @entity161 ’s lawyers manage to defend @entity12 today			1
but he was spot on when he lauded @entity19 ’s ‘ perfect test ’			2
before this series began , we feared a clash shot through with mid-table mediocrity , and so far the sides have traded blows accordingly			0
both were neutered by @entity170 ’s answer to the @entity171 , before @entity19 imploded at @entity36 and @entity7 surrendered in @entity46			1
positive spin : @entity30 ( right ) salutes taking his fifth wicket of @entity7 's second innings - he finished with six since momentum is the most over-rated concept in international sport ( a clue : it does n’t actually exist ) , trying to predict what happens next is futile			1
suffice to say that @entity19 are in less denial than they were this time last week , while @entity7 need to wake up quickly			2
on a pitch laden with runs , 10 of their batsmen passed 20 yet none made 55			0
even @entity187 , who alone stood firm on the final morning , deserved a quiet talking - to after hitting a @entity30 long hop straight up in the air on the third evening			2
and if they continue to ignore @entity190 , @entity19 will be thrilled			0
it ’s only one test			0
but @entity27 ’s @entity19 needed to start somewhere			2
@entity192 @entity193 the word for a while now has been that , some time soon , @entity7 will withdraw their opposition to @entity86 , thus minimising the chances of an international cricketer ’s career being ruined by a duff decision			2
but when @entity49 was asked whether events at the @entity8 – where both sides suffered howlers – had changed @entity7 ’s stance on technology , he was unequivocal			1
‘ no. ’ he enlarged on his view			0
‘ but there ’s an interesting thing you know , ’ he said			0
‘ there was a ball that clipped @entity215 ’s inner thigh but it showed that the ball hit the stumps			0
the ball went to wicketkeeper and it did n’t touch the bails at all			0
so that shows how accurate the @entity86 is			0
’ no review of their stance : @entity49 ( centre ) and @entity7 are still opponents of @entity86 was @entity227 simply predicting what would have happened had the ball not been intercepted by @entity215 ’s inner thigh ? that , after all , is the point of @entity227			1
but no matter : @entity49 had seen an incident that means matches involving @entity7 will continue to be blighted by human error			2
sometimes , you really do despair			0
d - day for @entity12 why did @entity12 feel the need to get involved in a brief slanging match with @entity187 on the fourth evening in @entity46 , less than 48 hours before he was due to face justice @entity241 and relive @entity242 ? perhaps @entity19 had done too good a job in taking his mind off the hearing			1
and yet it ’s important that @entity12 is tried solely on the basis of events in the @entity170 pavilion			0
mystifyingly , the @entity250 have been briefing that they are going after him partly because of his incessant sledging over the years – a stance that can only weaken their case			0
@entity12 should have stopped abusing opponents years ago			0
but he must be convicted or acquitted because of what did or did n’t happen on thursday july 10			0
no need : @entity12 ( right ) got himself involved in a slanging match with @entity187 at the @entity8 save the players are cricketers such a bland lot that the world ca n’t contain its excitement when one of them gets a little political ? apparently so			1
one former @entity19 player suggested to me during the third test that @entity30 ’s ‘ @entity270 ’ and ‘ @entity272 ’ wristbands were unhelpful for the team because of the attention they commanded			1
he had a point – but only because corporate levels of banality are now the norm			0
@entity30 did n’t save the world , but neither did it stop turning			0
@entity278 , then … a colossus of a player called it a day last week , a man who bestrode one of the sport ’s theatre of dreams for years , racking up the runs and entertaining a nation			0
had he bowled , @entity289 truly would have been @entity291 ’s answer to @entity292			1
the sales are over : @entity291 's veteran batsman @entity289 ( right ) has called it a day			1

@entity19 beat @entity7 by 266 runs at the @entity8
@entity7 seemed to leave their heads and hearts at @entity36
they bowled @entity27 and @entity83 back into form
less experienced players *flourished* because seniors contributed
@entity49 is still an opponent of the @entity86
@entity12 got into a spat with @entity187 on eve of his hearing
why did cricket get so excited about @entity30 's wristbands ?
farewell to @entity289 , @entity291 's @entity292
