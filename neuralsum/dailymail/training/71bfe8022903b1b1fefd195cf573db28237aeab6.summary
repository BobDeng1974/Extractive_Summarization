@entity0 wants @entity1 to tear up his contract so he can join @entity3 on a free transfer , according to reports in @entity6			1
the @entity6 keeper is an institution at the @entity9 but lost his no 1 spot to @entity11 two seasons ago and now only starts for @entity1 in the @entity13			1
and with @entity1 having signed @entity15 keeper @entity14 , @entity0 will look for a new challenge , according to @entity17			2
one stumbling block could be that they have already agreed a deal for a goalkeeper , Â£ 3.2million for @entity31 's @entity30 @entity29			0
with the departure of @entity33 to @entity34 , however , @entity3 are a bit light on keepers so @entity0 may still be pursued even if @entity38 signs			0
that could leave the future of @entity43 no 1 @entity41 in doubt as @entity0 would surely not want to warm the bench at the @entity46 after his months of frustration in @entity1			0
nice work : @entity3 are understood to have agreed a fee for @entity50 1 @entity29 ( left )			2
