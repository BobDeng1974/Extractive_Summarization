by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 13:52 est , 18 march 2013 police were embroiled in a row today after they allowed an @entity4 star to fire a taser for a publicity stunt			1
officers were accused of breaking the law by allowing hockey player @entity9 to blast a tin - foil target with the fearsome 50,000 volt weapon			1
the resulting footage and photographs were proudly placed on @entity1 ’s website to promote its work with women officers			1
taser stun guns are classified as a firearm and it is illegal for anyone to possess one unless they are a police officer or ‘ crown servant ’			1
tough laws designed to prevent the spread of potentially lethal weapons mean anyone caught with a firearm faces a minimum five year jail sentence			1
one critic said he was ' astonished ' that a celebrity had been allowed to fire a taser and said police may well have broken the law			1
put through her paces : olympian @entity9 was allowed to fire the a taser which could have broken the law @entity1 dispute that miss @entity9 broke the law as she was ' fully supervised ' when she used the gun @entity9 was part of the womens ' field hockey team who beat @entity57 3 - 1 to claim bronze at the @entity59 @entity60 , a @entity61 - based campaigner who has examined the use of the weapons , suggested police are becoming ' complacent ' about their use			1
he said : ' strict safeguards are in place which ought to control the police use of weapons			0
' police officers need to be authorised to carry taser weapons , members of the public should n't be getting their hands on them under any circumstances			0
' but @entity1 dispute that miss @entity9 broke the law as she was ‘ fully supervised ’ when she used the gun			1
the incident came amid mounting concern about the increased use of taser weapons by police officers across the country			2
many forces are ramping up the number of officers allowed to use them and investing in extra equipment claiming it will make police and the public safer			0
but critics have expressed fears that the weapons are being used inappropriately and in trivial confrontations that could be resolved without force			0
the @entity95 has revealed how prisoners have been tasered for refusing to remove their underwear and several cyclists have also been shot			0
miss @entity9 , a member of @entity100 ’s bronze medal winning hockey team , joined police officers for a training day at an training indoor centre			2
one critic said he was ' astonished ' that a celebrity had been allowed to fire a taser and said police may well have broken the law the olympian was allowed to blast a tin - foil target with the 50,000 volt weapon during the training day miss @entity9 later wrote on @entity114 that she had enjoyed her day with @entity1 she swapped her hockey stick for a baton as she confronted violent ‘ criminals ’ , smashed a door down and was petrol bombed during a mock riot			1
the 28 - year - old was also filmed as she examined and fired a live @entity107 weapon , of the same kind worn by officers on the streets			0
referring to the red laser dot sight , a burly instructor tells her to ‘ take the safety off and then you can light someone up ’			0
olympian : @entity9 , left , celebrates with @entity132 after scoring a goal against @entity134 during their women 's hockey competition preliminary round match at the @entity59 @entity138 can then be seen as she discharges a five second burst of electricity into a tin - foil target in the shape of a person			2
under the @entity107 is defined as a prohibited weapon , alongside other stun guns and @entity147 gas canisters			0
it states that a taser can only be possessed by someone ‘ authorised by the @entity152 ’ , in this case home secretary @entity151			2
the only exemptions are the police or ‘ other persons in the service of @entity158 ’ , for example personnel in the @entity160			2
anyone found with an unauthorised firearm faces a minimum five year jail sentence , except in exceptional circumstances			1
experts said the question of whether miss @entity9 has committed a crime is a ‘ grey area ’ and it is extremely unlikely she would be prosecuted			1
this is because the definition of ‘ possessing ’ the weapon is ambiguous and because she was on police premises and under close supervision at the time			1
speaking afterwards she said : ‘ i think it helped , obviously accuracy is massive in my sport … it was useful and it was good to transfer my skills into this			0
’ miss @entity9 , who lives in @entity181 , posted pictures of her brandishing and firing the @entity107 on her personal @entity185 page			2
she later wrote on @entity114 that she ‘ enjoyed every minute of it ’ and offered her services to her local police team			2
but @entity1 quickly changed its publicity photographs and video to remove all references to the @entity107			2
mr @entity60 added : ' i do n't think we should be glamorising police use of tasers or firearms			0
' @entity198 by the police must be proportionate and a last resort			0
' i want to continue to live in a country where the police are largely unarmed and proud of their restraint when it comes to using the weapons they do have available to them			0
' i think showing off their tasers in celebrity videos would be completely at odds with the culture of policing we have , and which i would like to see maintained			0
' assistant chief constable @entity215 said : ‘ @entity1 was happy to host local olympian @entity9 at a recent public order training event to demonstrate the rigorous training that officers undergo in order to carry out their varied range of duties			1
‘ during this time , @entity9 was given the opportunity to use a taser whilst being carefully guided and directed by a highly - trained taser instructor in a safe , controlled environment			2
‘ at all times @entity9 was wearing protective equipment and fully supervised by a specialist instructor			0
‘ @entity9 used the firearm in a safe , controlled environment at the discretion of the officers on the day we do not accept that it was an ‘ illegal ’ use			1
