@entity1 's passport stamp collection probably trumps yours			1
the former @entity4 editor , author and adventurer has travelled to each of the world 's 196 countries over a period of fifty years			1
@entity1 , now 78 , has encountered everything from run ins with guerillas in @entity14 to being attacked by flying crabs in @entity16 and being interrogated by @entity18 secret police			1
' aged six , i started to collect postage stamps , and where the other kids specialised in certain countries , i wanted a stamp from every country in the world			2
getting a passport stamps from every one may have been inspired by that , ' he tells @entity30			0
' those little coloured bits of perforated paper also instilled in me a fascination with travel because i wanted to see the lands where all the objects , people , and places depicted on those stamps came from			2
' the @entity40 of @entity41 spend several years under the supervision of a wig master to grow these huge wigs , says @entity1 ' my parents were poor and could not afford to travel , which led me to resolve early on that there was more to life than hanging around in one city forever			1
the author has been driven by wanderlust ever since : when he was 28 he led an expedition around the world the set the record for the longest direct , non-repetitive automobile journey ever made around the earth			2
and growing older spurred him on			0
' as i moved past middle age , i still wanted to do one grand and glorious travel venture , to go out with a bang rather than a whimper , and , after i realized that i had been to 90 nations , i decided that i just might be able to visit every one of the 196 countries during my allotted years , ' he says			1
his travels have taken him to the furthest flung corners of the globe , allowing him to meet some of the world 's most colourful characters : in his book , @entity70 in @entity71 , released this month , he fondly remembers a flamboyant camel driver ; a voodoo priest and a deaf and mute @entity76 badminton @entity77			1

' we all read about the economic inequality between the rich and poor nations , and about the great wealth gap between the rich and poor people within nations , but until you actually see people – one third of the world , in fact – trying to manage to live on less than two dollars a day , it does not hit home , ' says @entity1 in the course of his travels @entity1 has eaten : @entity104 - in the hills of @entity106 @entity107 - in @entity108 fish lips , fish eyes , fungus soup , duck 's feet , roasted duck gizzard , braised jellyfish , spicy soup of shredded intestines and organ meats boiled in blood , sea cucumber - in @entity121 @entity122 , ostrich , emu , and @entity125 - in @entity126 poisonous ugu sushi - in @entity76 possum pie - various @entity128 islands guinea pig - in @entity130 , @entity131 crocodile in @entity133 and @entity126 @entity134 , antelope , eland , gazelle , springbok , steenbok , klipspringer , kudu , nyala , and oryx - in @entity133 pigeon - in @entity143 and @entity144 iguana - in @entity145 blood sausage - in @entity147 and @entity148 smashed chicken infused with sugar and covered with ice cream - in @entity152 snake - various places horse - in @entity154 and @entity155 @entity157 's blood porridge , caramelized fish hatchlings , lotus root salad , steamed blood cockles , caramelized pork belly and @entity163 rat - in @entity164 toasted leafcutter ants , oven - baked tarantulas , waxworm potato fritters , bees , beetles , crickets , worms , caterpillars , scorpions , wax moth larvae , and grubs - in many places , and not always intentionally @entity1 's adventures have seen him trapped @entity178 and crocodiles in @entity180 ; unable to furnish the required proof to the @entity183 police that he was not @entity184 ; being unable to prove to the @entity18 secret police that he was not @entity186 and been thrown in jail in @entity188 when a con artist pretended he had hit him with a land cruiser			1
he lists the most hair - raising moments as : being stranded on @entity194 , pick pocketed in @entity195 and robbed of much equipment in @entity197 and the @entity198 , nearly lynched in @entity199 , almost drowned in @entity200 , detained by the police in @entity201 and @entity202 , jailed in @entity188 , attacked by the flying crabs in @entity16 , breaking three ribs and ripping flesh and tearing rotator cuffs in many lands			2
with an accommodation budget of around £ 7 per night , the writer has unrolled his sleeping bag ' at border posts , roadsides , jungles , glaciers , airport floors , and in hostels , tents , trailers , trees , teepees , campers , cars , caravansaries , desert dugouts , and flea - bag motels alternately sweating and freezing ; dodging dengue - fever mosquitoes by day and malarial ones by night			2
' ' i preferred to eat from open - air stands where i could see the cooking , and the dishwashing , and how healthy the chef looked			2
here @entity234 ' the children in a @entity81 orphanage have been taught to perform a show to entice prospective parents into adopting them modes of transport have varied			0
@entity1 explains that he 's travelled by ' ancient @entity242 airplanes ; leaky , overloaded foreign ferries ; broken - down , jam - packed bush taxis driven on rutted roads at 100 mph by wild kids who never passed a driving test ; pole - pushed canoes loaded with 40 people and 20 sheep			1
' he 's ridden atop a cotton truck in @entity252 , camels , donkeys , horses , elephants , rickshaws , carts , wheelbarrows , and tuk - tks , as well as ' motorcycles , catamarans , hydrofoils , dugout canoes and the @entity265			1
in short , almost anything that transports people , except an ambulance , thank @entity269			0
' and of course , @entity1 has been privy to some of the world 's rarest - and sometimes unappealing - culinary offerings			1

' youth around the world : left , a young girl from @entity285			0
right , a young girl with her face painted at a festival in @entity289 beards : @entity293 , a @entity292 man shows off his topiary , right , a distinguished looking @entity296 gentleman poses with his medal ' among the more memorable was an anteater @entity299 [ his companion ] and i found recently run over on a road in @entity303			0
not wanting to waste a good source of protein , we chopped it up , added salt and pepper , wished we had a box of @entity311 , roasted it over a campfire , and it tasted … awful , like a burger marinated in formic acid , ' he says			0
' rats are , in contrast – and after you overcome any squeamish cultural bias - rather tasty , especially the big boys eaten in @entity133 , where they 're called ' grass cutters , ' an appealing appellation doubtless bestowed by the branding consultant who renamed the @entity326 toothfish as ' @entity327 ' and the slimefish as ' orange roughy			1
' the locals skin the rodents , split them down the middle , spread them out flat , and roast or grill them			0

if it lived in a cane field , it tastes like sugar			0
' unfortunately , the elephant dung beetle i ate in @entity108 smelled exactly like what it ate , but i overcame this olfactory impediment with a liberal application of insect repellant under my nose			2
' ' and then there was the pulsating brain of that live monkey in @entity350 ... ' ' the residences and dwelling places made me wonder if it is fair or necessary to have such wide disparity between the haves and the have - not around the world , ' says @entity1 @entity1 met thousands of colourful characters on his travels , including a prostitute in @entity360 , left , and a happy @entity362 man , right what did he learn on the road ? ' we all read about the economic inequality between the rich and poor nations , and about the great wealth gap between the rich and poor people within nations , but until you actually see people – one third of the world , in fact – trying to manage to live on less than two dollars a day , it does not hit home			1
' unless you are there , it is almost impossible for us to imagine what it is like to have to provide shelter , food , clothing , medical care , and all the other necessities of life on two dollars a day			0
' ' with the exception of the few truly weird countries ( like @entity81 and those in the midst of famine or war ) people around the world are pretty much the same in terms of their love for their families and children , their desire to be happy , and their hope to live in peace and have a better life			0
' the main differences i observed were that people in the very poor countries were far more able to get along on less than citizens of the rich countries ever could			0
