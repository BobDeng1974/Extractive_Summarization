it is a scene of domestic mayhem you might see at any family home in middle @entity4			1
with the school day over , five - year - old @entity5 ca n't wait to chase his little sister @entity7 through their @entity9 terraced family home			1
as the children shriek uproariously , their parents , @entity13 and @entity14 , laugh indulgently at their antics			2
yet behind the laughter and the smiles lies a heartbreaking confession			2
for the truth is that had @entity13 and @entity14 understood how desperately ill their little boy would be , they would have opted for a course of action that many still find unthinkable			2
they would have terminated the pregnancy			2
' i love my son			2
he 's changed our lives , ' @entity13 says			2
' but if i 'd known everything that @entity5 would have to go through , and will have to go through , there 's no doubt in my mind that , given the correct information , i would have asked for a termination			1
@entity38 , five , needs round - the - clock care and his parents say they regret not having an abortion because of his problems , pictured with his sister @entity7 , three ' i 'm adamant about that			2
and it makes me feel guilty just saying it because @entity5 is my world			1
i love him , he 's an amazing little boy			2
' born with severe micrognathia , a condition that causes an undersized jaw and acute breathing difficulties , @entity5 needs round - the - clock care			1
he has a permanent tracheostomy , is fed nutrient - rich milk through his stomach , has slurred speech and a deformed right arm			1
sitting at @entity13 's side , husband @entity14 nods in agreement			2
' we made it clear to the doctors that we did n't want a child who was n't going to be able to ride a bike and do things that normal children do , ' he says			2
@entity5 's parents , @entity14 and @entity70 , were forced to leave their jobs to care for their son and they have now been declared bankrupt @entity13 interrupts			1
' it sounds awful , does n't it ? i would hope that people would look at the whole story and the whole situation before they make a judgment			2
nobody knows how they will feel until they 're in that situation			2
' the fact is that the @entity85 ' lives have been shattered			2
forced to leave their jobs to care for @entity5 , they have been declared bankrupt and have now lost their home			1
they get through the weeks and months with the help of anti-depressants			2
they are furious that – as they see it – the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) in @entity95 failed to tell them how gravely disabled @entity5 would turn out to be , and what consequences would follow			1
only now have they abandoned a five - year legal battle to get justice from the @entity102			0
they simply do n't have the money to continue			0
as for @entity5 , he suffers constant stress , has endured endless hospital visits and operations , and may have a tracheostomy tube for the rest of his life			1
@entity14 , 30 , and @entity13 , 31 , from @entity112 , met online in 2005			0
they married in 2008 and were delighted when @entity13 became pregnant			0
during a 20 - week ultrasound scan , the sonographer noticed that the baby 's long bone in his right arm was on the bottom end of the growth scale			1
another scan a few days later revealed @entity5 could have radial club hand , a condition that causes the hand to point towards the body , and @entity13 was referred to the @entity94			1
@entity126 is a term for a lower jaw that is smaller than normal			0
in some cases , the jaw is small enough to interfere with the infant 's feeding			0
the problem can be caused by certain inherited disorders and syndromes			0
@entity126 is can cause the teeth not to align properly and it can result in breathing problems			1
children with this problem should see an orthodontist when the adult teeth come in			0
because children may outgrow the condition , it often makes sense to delay treatment until a child is older			1
she recalls : ' i could n't sleep or eat			0
it sounds awful , but i did n't want a baby with disabilities			0
i was thinking , ' is he going to be in a wheelchair ? am i going to lose my job and be a stay - in parent ? ' it was n't what i wanted for myself at the time			0
' at the @entity94 , @entity13 had a more in - depth scan and an amniocentesis test			0
one of the consultants mentioned that the baby had a small jaw , but @entity14 and @entity13 say micrognathia was n't mentioned			0
the main issue was that his arms and wrists appeared to be fixed in position			0
@entity13 says : ' when i say it out loud it sounds terrible , but i did n't want to bring a baby into the world that was going to have a sub-standard life			0
' the couple made the agonising decision to terminate the pregnancy			0
when they explained their wishes to the consultants , they were advised that it was too early to make a ' rash ' decision			0
during the next two months they had several more scans			0
the results from the amniocentesis were fine and chromosome tests came back normal			0
they were told the baby 's heart was normal , they were reassured that a kink in @entity5 's spine was minor , and that the problems with his arm could be fixed with surgery			1
the micrognathia had appeared on the scan notes as a potential problem , but @entity14 and @entity13 say the consultants never explained verbally to them the condition or what it would mean for @entity5 's quality of life			1
ultimately it was decided that the chances of @entity5 having the condition looked ' less convincing '			1
@entity14 and @entity13 say they were left feeling reassured			0
' we knew we were going to have a baby with a bad arm and bad hand , but that was it , ' @entity14 says			1
@entity5 was born at @entity214 in july 2009 by emergency caesarean section			1
he was tiny , weighing just 3.4 lb. doctors discovered he had severe micrognathia and a large tongue , which was tucked down his windpipe , preventing him from breathing			1
he was blue and floppy and was rushed to theatre for an emergency tracheostomy			1
' the surgeon came to get consent to put a tracheostomy in and said it was n't looking good , ' @entity13 says			1
' i thought @entity5 was dead			1
i remember discussing funeral arrangements with my dad			0
' @entity5 pulled through but it was found that as well as the micrognathia he had a cleft palate and a hole in his heart			1
he was very small and had the deformity in his right arm – and both conditions were deemed signs of @entity237 , a rare genetic disorder			1
the couple are furious and claim the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) in @entity95 ( pictured ) failed to tell them how gravely disabled @entity5 would turn out to be , and what consequences would follow before they could take him home , @entity14 and @entity13 had to perfect several procedures to care for @entity5 , including learning how to suction - out his tracheostomy several times an hour			1
despite the trauma of @entity5 's arrival , @entity13 soon found she was desperate for a second child			1
' my body craved a normal child , ' she says			0
' to give birth , hold the baby and breast - feed – all the stuff i missed out on with @entity5			1
' i ask if they would have terminated @entity7 , now three , had she shown abnormalities			0
they both nod their heads			0
' i would n't want to put another child through what @entity5 has been through , ' says @entity13			1
until @entity7 was born , @entity14 worked a 40 - hour week as a computer technician for @entity260			2
but he left the job to help @entity13 care for @entity5 and the new arrival			1
@entity13 had already quit her job at @entity265			0
before long the debts were piling up – the family had to forfeit their home and are now renting a four - bedroom house			2
feeling they had not been given the full picture of @entity5 's disabilities , @entity14 and @entity13 decided to launch a claim against the @entity102			1
two weeks before the court date , which had been set for last monday , their law firm , working on a ' no - win , no - fee ' basis , dropped the claim , saying the couple did n't have a strong enough case			0
@entity13 says : ' for us , it was never about the money , it was about justice			0
i 've got no idea where we go from here			0
we have no pensions , no money , no house and no job prospects			0
but we love our son			0
he 's amazing and we 're going to give him the best life we can			0
' a spokesman for the @entity95 said it ' acknowledges the decision of @entity295 and mrs @entity70 to discontinue their claim			0
the @entity298 would like to extend its best wishes to @entity295 and mrs @entity70 and @entity5 for the future			1
