by @entity0 they are the seven dwarf galaxies - and they could shed new light on dark matter			1
researchers this week began experimenting with a new type of ' @entity8 ' telescope made by stitching together telephoto lenses			1
they almost instantly spotted the seven celestial surprises while probing a nearby spiral galaxy			2
spot the seen dwarves : this image shows the field of view from the @entity16 , centered on @entity17			0
inset images highlight the seven newly discovered galaxies			2
the @entity16 uses eight telephoto lenses with special coatings that suppress internally scattered light			1
this makes the telescope uniquely adept at detecting the very diffuse , low surface brightness of the newly discovered galaxies			1
it uses the same kind of lenses that are used in sporting events like the @entity32			2
the compact , oven - sized telescope was built in in 2012 at @entity35 skies , an observatory in @entity37 , @entity35 the previously unseen galaxies may yield important insights into dark matter and galaxy evolution , while possibly signaling the discovery of a new class of objects in space , researchers said			1
for now , scientists know they have found a septuplet of new galaxies that were previously overlooked because of their diffuse nature : the ghostly galaxies emerged from the night sky as the team obtained the first observations from the ' homemade ' telescope			1
the discovery came quickly , in a relatively small section of sky			2
' we got an exciting result in our first images , ' said @entity62 , a @entity63 graduate student and lead author of a paper about the discovery in the @entity67			2
' it was very exciting			0
it speaks to the quality of the telescope			0
' @entity72 , chair of @entity63 ’s astronomy department , designed the robotic telescope with @entity76 astronomer @entity75			0
their @entity16 uses eight telephoto lenses with special coatings that suppress internally scattered light			1
this makes the telescope uniquely adept at detecting the very diffuse , low surface brightness of the newly discovered galaxies			1
' these are the same kind of lenses that are used in sporting events like the @entity32			0
' we decided to point them upward instead , ' @entity72 said			0
@entity63 astronomers used a new telescope , the @entity16 , to detect the diffuse light of the new galaxies			1
he and @entity75 built the compact , oven - sized telescope in 2012 at @entity35 skies , an observatory in @entity37 , @entity35 the telescope was named @entity16 because the lenses resemble the compound eye of an insect			1
' we knew there was a whole set of science questions that could be answered if we could see diffuse objects in the sky , ' @entity72 said			0
in addition to discovering new galaxies , the team is looking for debris from long - ago galaxy collisions			1
' it ’s a new domain			0
we ’re exploring a region of parameter space that had not been explored before , ' @entity72 said			0
the @entity63 scientists will tackle a key question next : are these seven newly found objects dwarf galaxies orbiting around the @entity17 spiral galaxy , or are they located much closer or farther away , and just by chance are visible in the same direction as @entity17 ? if it ’s the latter , @entity62 said , these objects represent something entirely different			1
' there are predictions from galaxy formation theory about the need for a population of very diffuse , isolated galaxies in the universe , ' @entity62 said			2
' it may be that these seven galaxies are the tip of the iceberg , and there are thousands of them in the sky that we have n’t detected yet			0
' @entity62 stressed that until they collect more data and determine the distances to the objects , researchers wo n’t know their true nature			0
but the possibilities are intriguing enough that the team has been granted the opportunity to use the @entity152 for further study			0
' i ’m confident that some of them will turn out to be a new class of objects , ' @entity72 said			2
' i ’d be surprised if all seven of them are satellites of @entity17			0

previously unseen galaxies may yield important insights into dark matter and galaxy evolution
possibly signaling the discovery of a new class of objects in space
discovery made with new type of ' @entity8 ' telescope built by stitching together telephoto lenses .
