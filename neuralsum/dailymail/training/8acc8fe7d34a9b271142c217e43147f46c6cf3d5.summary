@entity1 's exit from @entity2 is the biggest test the club will face in the coming years , says @entity6 chief executive @entity5			1
@entity1 this month celebrated 18 years as manager at @entity2 , who need look no further than @entity9 and life after sir @entity11 to see how difficult it is to replace such a pivotal figure at a football club			1
the @entity15 , who is 65 next week , signed a three - year contract extension in may after ending a nine - year trophy drought by winning the @entity18			1
@entity5 says @entity1 has put @entity2 in a fantastic position and he will be tough to replace @entity1 signed a new three - year contract in may and @entity5 ( left ) says it will be difficult to replace him @entity22 : 1997 – 98 , 2001 – 02 , 2003 – 04 @entity18 : 1997 – 98 , 2001 – 02 , 2002 – 03 , 2004 – 05 , 2013 – 14 @entity23 : 1998 , 1999 , 2002 , 2004 , 2014 @entity5 told @entity24 : ' so much of the attention on a football club is around an individual and that 's very understandable at @entity2 because we have a giant who 's managing us			1
' @entity1 has been a fantastic driver and has put the club in a great , great position			2
the biggest challenge we 're going to face as a club is that , when that transition from @entity1 to the next manager of our football club happens - and i do n't know when that 's going to be - that we come through that strongly			1
' @entity5 , who has been in post for six years , is optimistic for the future and wants @entity2 to join the world 's elite			1
@entity5 added : ' i would n't be doing this job if i did n't believe we could compete at the very top level			2
i know @entity1 feels exactly the same way			2
' where we are currently is off the shoulder of the world 's top teams			0
' i think the best teams in the world are in @entity54 and you think about the great names in world football like @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 - i do n't think we 're at that level yet but that 's where we 're aiming to get to			0
' it 's one thing to say that and it 's another thing to be able to deliver it			0
' @entity5 says @entity2 should be reaching for the likes of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 @entity2 ended a trophy draught last season but have n't started the @entity22 quite as well during @entity2 's long slump without silverware - the move from @entity73 to the @entity74 led to straitened times for the @entity6 and saw leading players sold rather than retained - it seemed they might struggle to rediscover former glories , despite reaching the @entity78 for 17 successive seasons			1
' it has been incredibly frustrating not being able to be where we want to be these last few years , so winning the @entity18 was a fantastic moment , ' @entity5 added			2
' ( but ) i do n't come out of that feeling satisfied like we 've achieved what we need to achieve			0
the hunger for success is immediate			0
' the moment you get away from that euphoria of the moment , the next question is , ' how do we have more of that ? ' ' that 's what everybody at this club is focused on			0
there 's no satisfaction in it - it 's what do we do now			0
' @entity1 celebrates with his team after the @entity18 win against @entity107 at @entity108 earlier this year @entity1 has tied @entity109 ( left ) and @entity110 ( right ) down to long - term deals where @entity112 and @entity113 are among the players to have departed , now @entity2 are signing the likes of @entity117 and @entity118 and keeping their most talented players in a sign of their ambition			1
' we 're signing some fantastic young talent and we 're keeping our players now , unlike the situation two or three years ago when we were really financially challenged and were losing our top players , ' @entity5 added			1
' we 're signing our top players to long - term contracts			0
guys like @entity109 and @entity110			0
' video @entity1 ' regrets ' @entity130 shove			0

@entity1 signed a new three - year contract in may but may retire after that

@entity5 says how club handle transition between @entity1 and next coach will be *crucial*
@entity5 has been chief executive at the @entity74 for six years
@entity2 are now keeping hold of young talent rather than selling it
