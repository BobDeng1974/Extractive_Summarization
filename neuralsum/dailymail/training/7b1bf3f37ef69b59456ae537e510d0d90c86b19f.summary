a man battling a rare form of cancer has had part of his face removed in a bid to save his life			2
@entity7 , 63 , has facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels			1
the great - grandfather of two has endured a series of operations , the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face			1
@entity7 , 63 , from @entity20 , @entity21 , has facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels			1
here he is pictured before surgery he first noticed a spot on his cheek but never expected it would lead to a serious cancer diagnosis , which would change his appearance so dramatically			2
‘ it all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so i did n’t worry about it , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
‘ but the spot started to spread so i went to see a gp and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and i was given a course of antibiotics			0
’ however , the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse , he was sent to hospital for tests			0
‘ never in a hundred years , could i have imagined that i would be told i had cancer , ’ mr @entity7 said			2
medics at @entity21 ’s @entity45 took a skin biopsy from mr @entity7 and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face			1
there was no other option than to perform life - saving surgery to remove the tumour in a 12 hour operation , with skin taken from mr @entity7 ’s thigh , grafted onto his face			1
the great grandfather of two has endured a series of operations , the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face , where skin from his thigh was used as a graft it took a number of weeks before mr @entity7 plucked up the courage to look at himself in a mirror			1
‘ i knew that the operation had to be done , so i just had to get on with it , said the father - of - four			0
‘ i was in hospital for a few weeks and i did feel a bit dubious about how i ’d look after the operation as i did n’t know what to expect			0
‘ when i was going home from hospital i thought “ i do n’t want to look in the mirror ”			0
‘ it was a few weeks before i had a proper look at myself and i did get frightened as it looked like i had a bandage on my face			0
‘ i was shocked and worried to go out of the house as i did n’t know what reaction i ’d get from people			0
‘ it took a few months before i left my home and i would spend a lot of time in my bedroom watching tv			0
’ mr @entity7 first noticed a spot on his cheek , which spread ( pictured ) but never expected it would lead to a serious cancer diagnosis , which would change his appearance so dramatically @entity100 is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour			1
it usually occurs in the head , neck , and especially in the scalp of elderly people			0
its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules			0
the treatment depends on the extent of the disease , but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction			2
radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue			0
source : @entity126 following the operation , doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and mr @entity7 underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells			1
but , just six months later , the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region ’s @entity137			1
mr @entity7 has had a total of six operations , including one to reconstruct his nose , which did not work and will require further facial surgery in the future			1
experts have told mr @entity7 that it is fortunate the cancer was growing outside his body and was therefore detected in time , as angiosarcoma tumours often grow internally			1
he said : ‘ i feel i ’m one of the lucky ones as my cancer was picked up quick enough for treatment			0
mr @entity7 has had a total of six operations , including one to reconstruct his nose , which did not work and will require further facial surgery in the future ‘ i just take things each day at a time , what else can i do ? i have to live my life and be happy			1
’ it is unlikely that mr @entity7 ’s cancer will be cured and he continues to get chemotherapy once a week with the aim of slowing down the progression of the disease			2
it is feared he will lose his right eye as the cancer has spread to that area			0
mr @entity7 , his wife @entity167 , 62 , and their family , have received help from @entity171 .			2
