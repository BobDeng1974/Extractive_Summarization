@entity3 , 55 , had posted a link to an article about plans for civil partnership ceremonies in churches with his own comment : ‘ an equality too far			2
’ after a lesbian colleague asked if that meant he did n’t approve , he posted that he could not understand ‘ why people who have no faith and do n’t believe in @entity30 would want to get hitched in church ’			2
another colleague complained that the comment was offensive , despite having not seen the post , and mr @entity3 was disciplined and had his post downgraded and his salary cut by £ 14,000			1
yesterday the married father - of - one launched a court battle to overturn the decision and win back lost earnings			1

i do n’t understand why people who have no faith and do n’t believe in @entity30 would want to get hitched in church			0
the @entity90 is quite specific that marriage is for men and women			0
‘ if the @entity95 wants to offer civil marriages to the same sex then that is up to the state ; but the state should n’t impose its rules on places of faith and conscience			0
’ later that week another colleague , @entity104 , who was not friends with mr @entity3 on @entity19 , complained about the post , despite not having seen it			1

that reduction was to be phased in over 12 months but , although mr @entity3 ’s appeal was rejected , that period was doubled to 24 months			1
@entity3 ’s bosses said the fact that he gave his job and his employer on his @entity19 profile meant others might see his comments as trust policy			2
however , he also revealed his liking for @entity148 and for wholemeal toast and apricot jam on the site			0
