by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 12:49 est , 10 october 2013 a young man who has spent almost a decade in prison for a brutal murder he insists he did n't commit , could be close to finally being freed			2
the only evidence that linked @entity5 to the murder of a sports editor found strangled in his office car park in @entity9 , @entity10 , was testimony from two witnesses who have since recanted their statements under oath			1
but after nearly 10 years in a maximum security prison , the 28 - year - old could finally be close to having his conviction quashed			1
hope : @entity5 , pictured with his legal team at a recent appeal hearing , could soon be released appeal : @entity5 has always denied that he was involved in the murder of @entity22 if his most recent appeal is upheld @entity5 , who has consistently denied being involved in the death of @entity22 , could be home in time for @entity26			1
' it 's hard to have much hope , at this point , in the justice system based on what they 've done , ' he told @entity33			2
it is easy to understand his cautious optimism			2
@entity5 was just 21 when he was sentenced to 40 years for a murder his friend @entity37 had implicated him in , despite @entity37 not remembering any details of the night in question			1
even after @entity37 recanted his account , telling an appeals court he had lied under oath , @entity5 remained behind bars			1
' it 's scary knowing that they 're not looking for the truth , they 're looking for a conviction … i might never have a chance to get my life back again , ' he said			2
the latest step in his legal challenge came last month , when lawyers took his case to a @entity57 appeals court			0
cautious : after spending ten years in jail for a crime he says he did n't commit , @entity5 finds it hard to be optimistic now @entity5 , his father @entity5 and rest of the family who have campaigned tirelessly to have his conviction overturned , are waiting to hear if the judges will grant him a new trial			1
victim : sports editor @entity22 was found strangled in his newspaper 's car park chief legal analyst for @entity72 , @entity73 , said there would be no evidence to convict @entity5 is a retrial is ordered			1
a bloody footprint and hair found at the crime scene did not match him , and the witnesses whose testimony his conviction was based on , later admitted they had lied under oath			1
after spending his adult life behind bars , @entity5 is just trying to stay positive			1
' i 'm going be ready for whatever life throws at me because i 've been preparing for so long , ' he said			0
' i just … maintain positivity and hope that one day i 'll wake up and i 'll get a good phone call			0
' he has constantly proclaimed his evidence , ever since @entity37 told police they had been involved in the crime two years after @entity95 sports editor mr @entity22 was discovered strangled to death by his own belt in the early hours of november 1 , 2001			2
@entity37 told police the pair , who had been 17 at the time , had been drinking underage at a nearby bar and that he could not remember what happened on the night in question			0
after reading a newspaper article about the murder he became convinced he was involved , saying that a photo fit of a man seen near the scene looked like him			2
in his police interviews @entity37 , who was a drug user , was unable to give details of the crime , wrongly stating that mr @entity22 had been strangled by a shirt , or a bungee cord , before the detective questioning him tells @entity37 it was a belt			0
confess : a mug shot of @entity37 , right , who said he was involved after seeing a photofit , right , in a paper memory loss : @entity37 , who says he can not remember the night of the murder , recently retracted his statement that @entity5 was involved he claimed however , that he struck the editor once , before @entity5 strangled him			1
' the police threatened me to implicate @entity5 or else i would be solely responsible for @entity22 ’s death and be charged with first - degree murder and possibly sentenced to death , ' @entity125 said in an affidavit			1
despite fingerprints , a bloody footprint and other evidence found at the scene not matching @entity37 or @entity5 , police arrested them			1
' everything is wrong about this case , everything 's wrong about it			0
it makes absolutely no sense , ' @entity142 , who is working of @entity5 's appeal , told the court			1
@entity5 stated to police that on the night @entity22 was killed , he and @entity37 had gone to a bar and then he drove them home			1
when his latest appeal was denied , @entity5 told @entity151 : ' i just sat in this room by myself			1
and just stared at the floor ... and it 's frustrating because you do n't know , even with all the facts , if you 'll ever get your life back			0
' the appeal last year centered around the two witnesses who had implicated @entity5 both admitting they lied			1
tribute : @entity162 was the sports editor at the @entity95 and a father of two crime scene : the sports editor was leaving his office after 2am when he was strangled in the car park @entity37 , who is serving a 25 - year - sentence , is now saying that although he still has no memory of the night in question , he believes he acted alone			1
tribune janitor @entity171 , who said he saw the young men at the scene , also later admitted under oath that he had falsely identified them from a picture he was shown			2
in his police interview , @entity37 said : ' i could just be fabricating it all and not know			0
this is after reading the newspaper article in october and this is kinda what i put together with what could 've happened			2
' he went on to say : ' from there on i 'm just presuming what happened			0
i 'm making presumptions based on what i read in the newspaper			0
' according to the @entity95 , a key witness who was the last person to see the victim alive , was never thoroughly investigated			0
fellow sportswriter @entity192 had left the office the same time as @entity22 , who was married with two children			0
he says that he drove off before @entity162			0
campaign : @entity5 , left , with his father @entity5 and sister , @entity198 , who are trying to have him released the 1991 blue @entity199 he was driving that night was never searched , and he traded it shortly afterwards			1
police have never been able to trace it			0
a forensic pathologist , dr @entity202 , has examined evidence from the trial for ms @entity142 , @entity151 said			2
he claims that the tire tool @entity37 said he used to beat his victim did not fit the injuries			0
he added that the struggle lasted between six to eight minutes , meaning mr @entity192 put himself at the scene very close to the time the crime was reported			1
according to @entity151 mr @entity192 said he left the car park at about 2.20am , only six minutes before 911 was called			0
mr @entity192 , who has always cooperated with investigators and denied having anything to do with the crime , told 48 hours that he returned to the car park later that night after hearing about the murder			0
' i 've always felt that the system works , ' ms @entity142 said , as she explained her determination to have him freed			0
' he is absolutely innocent			0
... i do n't want to be part of a system that can not recognize and correct an error			0
' his family have gone to great lengths to raise awareness about @entity5 's case , including driving a car emblazoned with his picture across the @entity230 support : @entity232 has constantly campaigned for his son 's release and recently drove across the @entity230 in a car featuring details of @entity5 's case on the @entity238 , @entity5 sent a message from his cell saying how the support has helped him through his ' hellish experience '			1
' the contrast between the freedom which the open road on a beautiful day offers and the mind numbing confinement of these claustrophobic concrete walls could n't be more harsh , ' he said , in reference to the road trip undertaken to promote his cause			0
@entity5 's story will be featured on @entity254 tonight at 12.35am eastern time .			2

@entity5 has always maintained his innocence
no evidence links 28 - year - old to scene of killing in @entity10
only witnesses retracted statements that put @entity5 at the scene
