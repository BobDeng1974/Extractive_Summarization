@entity2 manager @entity1 will receive a hero 's welcome when he returns to @entity5 on saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57 - year - old , he must wonder if he 'll ever be successful at the right end of the @entity10			1
for all the expertise @entity1 has in keeping clubs in the top flight , a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of @entity17 and @entity5 supporters , his overall record is one of the worst of any long - serving @entity10 manager			1
this is his seventh season in the top flight and he 's never finished in the top half of the table			1
if , as expected , @entity26 's @entity25 do n't drop lower than 10th , @entity1 will be the only manager in the @entity10 with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th			1
@entity1 has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the @entity10 to add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the @entity5 fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season , @entity1 will know he is n't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated			1
@entity2 's home defeats against @entity39 and @entity40 have left them stuck on 33 points			1
that is still seven points above the bottom three but with four of their final five fixtures after the weekend coming against @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , there is not much wriggle - room			2
for many , producing statistics to suggest @entity1 could have produced better results is heresy			2
he won promotion with @entity17 and got them to an @entity58 final			0
he turned @entity5 's season around 12 months ago and is still favoured to keep @entity2 up this time			2
@entity1 did an excellent job in turning around @entity5 's fortunes last season palace fans were pleased with the job @entity1 did in his time at @entity65 he is known as a good organiser , a smart tactician and someone who is able to get the best out of players and bend the laws of the game to his advantage			2
and yet , why has he never finished higher than 11th , achieved in 2009/10 with @entity17 and 20013/14 with @entity5 ? it is right to say he has never had the best clubs with the most money to manage and yet @entity77 finished sixth with @entity78 , @entity79 sixth with @entity80 , @entity82 eighth with @entity83 and @entity84 is currently eighth with @entity25			0
none of them giants of the game			0
@entity1 took @entity17 into the @entity10 and turned them into an established team @entity89 , who has achieved a similar miracle at @entity5 this season to what @entity92 achieved last season , has a top - five finish at @entity96 on his cv			1
two years ago , @entity17 effectively sacked @entity1 , acknowledging the huge contribution he made to the club but feeling he could n't take them any further			2
@entity79 now has the club sitting in 10th place , higher than @entity102 achieved , and on a smaller wages budget			0
@entity89 could guide @entity5 into the top half of the table just as @entity79 could do at @entity17 - something @entity102 never achieved @entity1 will remain plain - speaking til the end			1
the @entity107 wo n't be able to enjoy his visit to @entity5 given the importance of the game			0
' we need a 90 minutes from the players			0
i do n't care what anyone says , everyone has a go in this division and the lads have to understand that			0
' what we have to do is get back to basics and defend properly			0
lower league mistakes cost you goals			0
' you 'd back @entity1 ' message to keep @entity2 up			1
whether he can take them to a higher level next season is another question			0
