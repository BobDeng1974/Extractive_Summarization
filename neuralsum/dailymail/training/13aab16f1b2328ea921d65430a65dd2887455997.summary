by @entity0 published : 03:42 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 07:29 est , 24 september 2013 it may have been rated ' excellent ' by the school inspectors , but when it comes to spelling , it seems @entity5 ‘ must do better ’			1
a sign outside the private girls ' school proudly announced that the @entity8 had given it the top rating in every category - or rather , every ' catergory ' , as the glaring typo on the sign put it			1
staff at the £ 11,000 - a - year school spotted the mistake and the sign was quickly taken down - but not before a passer - by had taken a photo , which was duly splashed across social media			1
@entity20 's : the offending sign was snapped by a passer - by and has done the rounds on @entity23 and @entity24 the sign read : ' @entity26 - " excellent " in every catergory [ sic			1
] - " @entity29 ' , and it has been widely tweeted and emailed			0
the school , which caters to pupils aged between four and 18 , admitted its blunder and tweeted sheepishly : ' yes , we know about the sign			2
we took it down as soon as it was spotted - but not before the photo was taken # redfacesallround			0
' according to the school 's website , the latest report by the @entity8 - the government body which rates private schools and is the equivalent of @entity44 in the state sector - declared that ' pupils receive an excellent education so that they leave the school as strong , open minded and confident women who are independent and who use their initiative '			1
@entity52 said the plan had been to refurbish the sign to celebrate their inspection report			2
she said : ' unfortunately the sign - writer completed the work over the weekend , making an error when copying from the agreed wording and spelling			2
' we were only made aware of the spelling error on wednesday morning when a parent alerted us to it , and it was corrected immediately			0
' we are amazed by the amount of attention this has attracted when all we wanted to do was celebrate our amazing inspection results			0
' the message has certainly gone out far and wide			0
this will be a lesson to all our school community to always check spellings carefully			0
' top of the class : @entity5 charges fees of up to £ 11,000 a year			1

@entity5 *misspells* ' category ' as ' catergory ' in sign
@entity82 said £ 11,000 - a - year school wanted to celebrate inspector report
@entity8 gave school top rating in 2013 report
