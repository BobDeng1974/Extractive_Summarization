the @entity2 earthquake that has killed at least 2,500 people was a ' nightmare waiting to happen ' , disaster experts said last night			1
just a week ago , 50 earthquake scientists from country the world met in the capital @entity9 to discuss how the area would cope with such disaster			1
resting on colliding tectonic plates , @entity2 is under constant threat of earthquake of natural disaster			1
but experts claim its shoddy infrastructure and poor building standards make the country much less equipped to deal with the aftermath of major incidents			2
speaking of the @entity2 capital where the scientific meeting was held , one expert said it the devastation was ' an accident waiting to happen '			0
' physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen , ' said seismologist @entity40 , head of the earth sciences department at the @entity42			0
' i was walking through that very area where that earthquake was and i thought at the very time that the area was heading for trouble , ' said mr @entity40 , lead scientist for @entity49 , a group that tries to help @entity52 cities prepare for disasters			1
locals rescued two more dust - covered men , pulling them up on the the street as they work to find and rescue any survivors of the disaster earthquakes of similar magnitude can have bigger effects on different parts of the globe because of the manner of building construction and population density			1
a 7.8 magnitude earthquake could kill 10 to 30 per one million residents in @entity69 , but has killed at least 1,900 in @entity2 , and could kill up to 10,000 in parts of @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , said @entity24 seismologist @entity75			2
with the death toll steadily creeping up ( to 2,500 on sunday evening ) , the full extent of the horror brought by the earthquake is slowly unfolding			1
as rescuers scramble to save stranded climbers on @entity83 where 18 died under avalanches yesterday , experts are warning the worst of the disaster is to come			1
aftershocks rocked the @entity89 country this morning with residents describing the tremors in terrifying detail			0
one registered 6.9 on the @entity94 and is feared to have triggered yet more avalanches on @entity83			1
while the original earthquake 's magnitude - 7.9 - labelled it a ' major ' incident , it struck just 11km underground , making its effects all the more devastating			1
coupled with that is its lack of preparation for such destructive tremors			2
a relatively poor country , its buildings are shoddily constructed and easily torn down			0
experts also fear the earthquake 's shallowness could have sparked landslides across the mountainous region			1
this is the fifth significant earthquake in @entity2 in the last 205 years , including a massive one in 1934 that levelled the city			2
' they knew they had a problem but it was so large they did n't where to start , how to start , ' said @entity122 , south east @entity123 regional coordinator for @entity124 , a group that calculates worldwide quake risks			2
@entity2 was making progress on reducing its vulnerability to earthquakes , but not quickly or big enough			2
mr @entity122 's group , on april 12 , updated a late 1990s report summarising the @entity132 risks			0
' with an annual population growth rate of 6.5 per cent and one of the highest urban densities in the world , the 1.5 million people living in the @entity132 were clearly facing a serious and growing earthquake risk , ' the report said , laying out ' the problem ' the valley faces			1
' it was also clear that the next large earthquake to strike near the @entity132 would cause significantly greater loss of life , structural damage , and economic hardship than past earthquakes had inflicted			2
' and for years there were no building codes and rampant development so homes and other structures could be built without any regards to earthquakes , the report said			0
there are now building codes , but that does n't help the older structures , and the codes are n't overly strong , mr @entity122 said			0
it 's actually even made worse because of local inheritance laws that require property be split equally among all sons , mr @entity40 said			0
' so that means buildings are split vertically among brothers making very thin rickety homes that need more space so people add insecure living space on additional floors , he said			1
' the construction is appalling in @entity9 , ' he said			1
poverty and pollution make the problem worse			0
that 's because people do n't spend time worrying about some future earthquake because they have more pressing problems			1
' if you live in the @entity132 you have other priorities , daily threats and daily nasty things happen to you in terms of air quality , water quality , pollution , traffic and just poverty , ' mr @entity40 said			0
' but it does n't mean that the earthquakes go away			0
' @entity2 rescue teams remove a body from the rubble of the historic 19th century @entity196 in @entity9 which collapsed in the quake people search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building after the earthquake hit @entity2 and surrounding countries at just after 6am @entity205 time the earthquake had an epicentre 80 kilometres north - west of @entity9 , according to @entity24 and strong tremors were also felt in large areas of northern and eastern @entity72 and @entity209 a man comforts a woman next to a seriously injured person on the ground in the aftermath of the disaster which is thought to have killed at least two volunteers help remove a huge pile of debris from what used to be a building in @entity221 before the quake which caused extensive damage with toppled walls and collapsed buildings huge teams of locals and volunteers help to heave away huge pieces of debris from homes , business and offices left by the earthquake panicked residents had rushed into the streets as the tremor erupted with the impact felt hundreds of miles away in big swathes of northern @entity72 and even in @entity209			1
video footage showed people digging through the rubble of the bricks from the collapsed tower , looking for survivors			2
@entity2 ’s capital @entity9 – with a population of over one million – was one of the worst - hit areas in @entity2 , with the quake ’s epicentre just 50 miles north of the city			1
as the tremors intensified , people were seen in scenes of mayhem running from their homes and places of work in panic			2
data from 1990 onwards dozens of people were gathered in the car park of @entity9 's @entity267 , where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside , some patients wearing hospital pyjamas , while doctors and nurses were treating people			1
the @entity24 said the quake struck 81 kilometres ( 50 miles ) northwest of @entity9 at 06.11 gmt , with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes			1
the 7.8 magnitude tremor was the worst to hit the poor @entity52 nation in over 80 years			0
television footage showed a huge swathe of houses had collapsed in while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact			2
@entity72 was first to respond to @entity2 's appeal for help by sending in military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams			0
@entity294 has deployed a team of humanitarian experts to @entity2 to provide urgent support for people affected by the quake , international development secretary @entity293 announced tonight			1
ms @entity293 said : ' my thoughts are with the people of @entity2 , in particular all those who have lost loved ones			0
' the absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured , and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes			0
' @entity2 needs our urgent humanitarian assistance			0
that is why we have rapidly deployed a team of humanitarian experts who will immediately begin work assessing the damage and helping the @entity2 authorities respond to this devastating earthquake			1
' it came after prime minister @entity320 pledged that the @entity294 would do all it can to help in the aftermath on the @entity2 earthquake			0
on @entity323 he said : ' shocking news about the earthquake in @entity2 - the @entity294 will do all we can to help those caught up in it			0
' foreign secretary , @entity328 , added his condolences and said the @entity294 @entity330 was providing help to any @entity294 nationals caught up in the disaster			0
' my thoughts are with the people of @entity2 and everyone affected by the terrible loss of life and widespread damage caused by the earthquake , ' he said			2
' we are in close contact with the @entity2 government			0
the @entity330 in @entity2 is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to @entity348			0

earthquake experts met in @entity9 last week to plan for similar disaster
scientists discussed how the *overdeveloped* area would cope with chaos
at least 2,500 people across four countries have died in the earthquake
hundreds are still missing after avalanches buried @entity83 *basecamp*
the quake struck just 11km *beneath* ground making its force even more destructive
