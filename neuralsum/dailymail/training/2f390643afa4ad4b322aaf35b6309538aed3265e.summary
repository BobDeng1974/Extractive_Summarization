there is no doubting the skill and craftsmanship of his artwork			0
but @entity6 ’s masterpieces are n’t created with a paintbrush or easel			1
instead , the 56 - year - old ’s canvases are the sprawling ski slopes of the @entity11 , and he creates his intricate patterns by running in snowshoes across the snow			2
it means that mr @entity6 can cover a total of more than 25 miles during each piece of work			1
each image takes up to 12 hours to design and make , with @entity6 currently produces about 30 snow drawing each year			1
his work has also led him to publish a book of his designs , inspired an underwear range , and seen him branch out into etching drawings on beaches			1
each image takes up to 11 hours to design and make , with @entity6 currently produces about 30 snow drawing each year his work has also led @entity6 to publish a book of his designs , inspired an underwear range , and seen him branch out into etching drawings on beaches the artist favours a level site with a depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs , which he takes from either an aircraft , summit or a ski lift his most intricate designs include the @entity51 , a @entity53 triangle as well as abstract cubes and spirals			1
he uses an orienteering compass to create the perfect geometric designs			2
each pattern is crafted by mr @entity6 alone in the skiing town of @entity60 , in the @entity61 , where he lives during winter			1
mr @entity6 , went to @entity62 and studied engineering at @entity64			1
in 1974 he won the @entity65			0
he has spent most of his adult life working as a freelance orienteering mapmaker and has now created around 175 designs after ploughing his first at @entity70 in 2004			1
his most intricate designs include the @entity51 , a @entity53 triangle as well as abstract cubes and spirals			2
he uses an orienteering compass to create the perfect geometric designs mr @entity6 , who studied @entity75 at @entity64 , said many of his patterns can equal the effort needed to climb halfway up @entity79 his work has proved so popular that @entity81 clothes label @entity83 launched @entity84 – a range of undergarments inspired by his designs			1
he uses what he describes as a ' kind of reverse orienteering ' to plot his intricate paths before walking along the route in a pair of snowshoes			0
most of mr @entity6 's patterns are crafted in the skiing town of @entity60 , in the @entity61 , where he lives during winter he said : ' the main reason for making them was because i can no longer run properly due to problems with my feet , so plodding about on level snow is the least painful way of getting exercise			1
mr @entity6 said many of his patterns can equal the effort needed to climb halfway up @entity79			1
he first plans out the pattern on graph paper , then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be , and starts at one of those points			0
from the centre he calculates the distance to the other points and walks out and back from the centre using either pace counting or a measuring tape to determine the number of steps he needs to take			0
the artist favours a level site with a depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs , which he takes from either an aircraft , summit or a ski lift			2
the designs only last until the next heavy snowfall			2
he added : ' i usually keep at it until i get too tired , using a headlamp if it gets dark first			0
it takes typically until i ca n't go on , but that can depend			0
' the setting - out serves as the warm - up then the real training is completing the design			0
once this second stage is started , i put on my personal stereo			0
' the artist from @entity147 , @entity145 added : ' most of the time i travel round the @entity11 and hike up mountains , aiming to be on the summit at sunset for good photos			2
‘ my feet are in a bad way but if i can keep my weight off the front of my feet things are not too bad			0
' often i am copying designs i have found , like crop circles or well - known mathematical figures , or repeating designs i have made earlier but failed to get good photos of			0
' some designs i am commissioned to do require a lot of study as to the best way to create it , and this process can take several hours			1
‘ the main danger is having a minor accident skiing down at night after i have finished drawing			0
‘ or running out of steam , if you push yourself too hard at the end of it			0
it is quite frightening how quickly you can run out of steam			0
’ more of mr @entity6 's work can be seen on his @entity178 page at @entity179			1
