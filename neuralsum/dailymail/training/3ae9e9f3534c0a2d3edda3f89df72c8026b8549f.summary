an @entity1 mother - of - two believes she can still ' parent from afar ' if she is chosen to travel on a one way ticket to @entity4			1
@entity6 teacher @entity5 has been selected as one of the 100 global finalists who are vying to become part of the four - person team to head off on the first mission to live on the @entity12 planned for 2024			1
one of seven selected @entity1 , ms @entity5 's two daughters will be young adults by the time the unprecedented project is ready , and she believes that while she would never be able to physically touch her children again she would remain an intregral part of their lives via satellite communication			1
' she said her youngest was very excited about the possibility of her mother living on another planet but her eldest was only slowly coming around to the idea			0
' my eldest daughter is turning 14 and definitely in her own world of friendships and sport and to be honest does n't show much interest at this stage but hopefully now that i 've got through to round three she might become a little bit more interested ' , she said			0
' my youngest daughter has been writing stories about space exploration and is quite excited with the prospect that we will have people living on @entity4 the mother - of - two believes she can still ' parent from afar ' if she is chosen to travel on a one way ticket to @entity4 ' if we can live in @entity4 we can live anywhere - it 's the next giant leap for mankind ' ms @entity5 says @entity73 ( left ) and @entity74 ( right ) are one of the seven @entity1 in the top 100 global finalists hoping to go to @entity4 ms @entity5 said there were many reasons why she hoped to be one of the final four to be the first humans to ever live in space			1
' i think that all humans have this natural curiosity and it 's the next giant leap for mankind , ' she said			0
' the first hole that we dig we expect to find more about @entity4 than we have with rovers being on the planet for the last few decades so there 's the science and the sustainable living , ' she said			2
' if we can live on @entity4 we can live anywhere			2
' however , she said she would not enjoy the seven long months in transit to get to @entity4			2
' that would be quite horrific - i 'm not looking forward to that part of the mission but showing the world that we can live sustainably , ' she said			0
when questioned about the inevitably different personalities that will be part of the close knit team , ms @entity5 said that was part of the selection process			2
there will be eight cargo missions to show that they can land rovers and supply units and have everything set up before so that the final four leave earth have oxygen , water and a habitat dr @entity118 ( left ) and ( right ) @entity117 will join the five other @entity1 who will train for eight years before it is decided who will become the astronauts ' doctor @entity122 who is in charge of the application process has lots of experience in choosing astronauts and he will profile us and put us in teams that we will train for eight years with , ' she said			1
' so we will know our team very well so if we are not compatible the teams will change or people will withdraw from the program			0
' the brave woman says she is well aware of the potential dangers involved with the mission			0
' there 's lots of risks with the mission - the benefits of the mission that @entity4 1 has planned is that it 's using proven technology so they are not waiting for technology to be invented to be able to make this mission a success , ' she said			1
' they will also do eight cargo missions to show that they can land rovers and supply units and have everything set up before people actually leave earth so we 'll have oxygen , water and a habitat			0
' the first man mission in currently scheduled for 2024 but ms @entity5 concedes that is an ambitious time frame			2
' then the plan is to have a colony on @entity4 and every two years they will send another four astronauts to live on @entity4 , so every four years for as long as the program is a success - we 'll keep sending people , ' she said			1
@entity172 host @entity171 suggested that the mission , which will be presumably taken up with single people , will become ' @entity175 ' and her co-host @entity176 added that the @entity12 could evolve into ' one big swingers party '			0
ms @entity5 laughed it off saying that she hoped the mission would become something that ' humanity can be proud of '			0
@entity182 ( left ) and ( right ) @entity183 are two more @entity1 who made the global top 100 list for the potential to live on the @entity12			1
