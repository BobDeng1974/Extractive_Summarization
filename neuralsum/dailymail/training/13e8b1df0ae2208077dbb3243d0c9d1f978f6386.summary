by @entity0 published : 14:05 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 14:06 est , 19 july 2012 saddle up , marine ! because this is looking like the game fans of the films have been waiting for – a true sequel to @entity6 's 1986 masterpiece , @entity7			1
knock , knock : an alien lurks behind an unsuspecting , and soon to be dead , grunt aliens : @entity12 is told through the eyes of corporal @entity14			1
a group of grunts are sent to investigate the @entity17 in search of @entity19 , corporal @entity20 and the rest of the missing soldiers who were dispatched to @entity7			1
using authentic environments inspired by the films , including @entity7 itself , the game promises to immerse you in the eerie , claustrophobic world that made the film series such a blockbuster success			1
first off , it ’s clear the game is in safe hands as @entity33 , the team behind the critically acclaimed @entity34 and @entity36 games , are behind the wheel			2
having seen the game in action , it looks superb – leaps and bounds above the average - at - best first - person blooper shooter , @entity43			2
lighting , as predicted , is the star of the show – creating the oppressive , nerve - shredding atmosphere @entity7 fans have long waited for			2
erm , i 've found something ! you 'll fight some old foes we watched as the marines did a ‘ sweep ’ of @entity7 - the frayed wires and twisted metal are all that remains of what was once a place where families lived			0
stagnant water dripped from exposed pipes as the soldiers meandered their way through the dark , bitterly cold metal maze			1
it was only a matter of time before their motion trackers registered movement - the haunting ' beep ' stopping the patrol in their tracks			0
and then they came - dragging one grunt face - first through a vent - his blood - curdling echo cut ruthlessly short with an almighty thud			0
aliens burst from every crack and cranny - their terrifying ' hisses ' drowning out the high - pitched blasts from the solders ' pulse rifles			1
the aliens ’ animations are superb			1
they crawl and scamper over walls and ceilings before diving at you ferociously			0
there was even a brief introduction to a new breed of alien – a huge beast that chases after you – leaving a trail of destruction in its wake			2
thankfully , you ’ll be armed to the teeth , tooled up with all the classic marine weapons			1
and when things get too hectic , you can call in your friends			0
the whole campaign can be played with a squad of up to four players , dropping in and out as necessary through self - contained missions within an over-arching narrative			0
there ’s also an extensive upgrade system that allows players to customise their characters to play the way they want			2
you can earn experience to get perks , new weapons and new looks for your squad			0
however , the bad news is that it ’s just been delayed … again			0
so , do n’t expect to get your hands on a copy until february next year			0
they 're coming out the walls ! if things get tough , call in your friends at any time also , for current gen owners , there are hints that the next gen @entity131 version will look the best , begging the question : is this @entity133 for current gen ? if it is , then what better game to send them off			1
follow @entity0 on @entity139 : @ @entity140 and on @entity141 : @entity142			0

' true sequel ' to 1986 classic aliens lets you play as a marine on a rescue mission to find lost soldiers
@entity131 version is meant to have best *graphics* which may spell the beginning of current gen ' death '
promises new breeds of alien never before seen in the movies
