by @entity0 published : 05:33 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 27 august 2013 a professor of physics who oversaw one of the world 's longest and most painstaking experiments has died without ever seeing it in action			1
@entity9 , former head of the department of physics at the @entity12 , was custodian of the @entity9 for 52 years			1
the experiment began in 1927 by @entity14 was designed to show that pitch , although it feels solid , will act like a fluid and flows through a glass funnel over time			1
only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping , and no - one has ever seen one fall three years after the experiment began , the glass funnel holding the pitch was cut to allow it to ' flow '			1
only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping , and no - one has ever seen one fall			1
earlier this year professor @entity9 , who died last week aged 78 following a stroke , said he expected the next drop would fall by the end of this year			1
' it 's got a mind of its own and in blink of an eye it can drop , ' professor @entity9 , told the @entity39			1
' @entity9 's death is particularly sad as in his time as the custodian of the experiment , he did not see a single drop fall , ' said professor @entity45			1
the experiment is now under constant surveillance , with three webcams trained on it to capture the ninth drop 's fall on camera			1
it can be viewed here			0
at room temperatures pitch , pictured , appears to be a brittle solid - but the series of ' drops ' which have formed in the @entity58 experiment prove that it is in fact a liquid last month , the researchers at at @entity63 captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time ever			1
drops take between seven and 13 years to fall and this is the first time a drop has been recorded on camera - a similar experiment in @entity58 missed filming its latest drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off			1
video : see the historic pitch drop fall pitch is the name for any ' viscoelastic , solid polymer '			1
it can be made from petrol and is also known as tar , bitumen or asphalt			2
pitch can also be produced in plants , known as resin and it is used to waterproof sails and ships			2
physicists from @entity63 claimed the viscosity of the pitch in its experiment is around 2 million times more viscous than honey , or 20 billion times the viscosity of water			1
how quickly the tar drops depends on the exact composition of the pitch , and the environment its in			1
it can be directly affected by temperature and vibrations			0
scientists used to think glass was a slow - moving liquid , because old church window panes are thicker at the bottom , but this is now considered a solid			2
pitch - drop experiments involve heating a sample of solid pitch to increase the material 's viscosity - ability to flow			2
it is then poured into a sealed glass funnel			0
the tar is left to settle before the stem of the funnel is removed to create a hole for the pitch to drop from			1
the @entity125 experiment is believed to be the second oldest pitch - form test			2
however , the origins of the @entity125 experiment are less known than the @entity14 test			0
according to the journal nature , it is believed to have been started by a professor at the @entity133 university , @entity134 , in 1944 to promote how science experiments can be used for education purposes			0
no - one was watching the drop and it 's believed many fell without being recorded			0
physicists at the college set up a webcam last april to start monitoring the experiment again and at around 5pm on 11 july the first drop was filmed falling			2

the tar is left to settle before the stem of the funnel is removed to create a hole for the pitch to drop from the @entity58 experiment has been much more widely documented and is in the @entity159 for being the world 's longest running scientific experiment			1
it is also believed to have enough pitch in the funnel to last for another hundred years			2
professor @entity9 was custodian of the experiment that is on public display at the @entity12 in @entity168 , @entity58			1
since starting at the university in the early 60s he missed all five drops that had fallen			2
since the webcam was erected next to the experiment it has attracted a large and devoted following of barmy boffins and amateur enthusiasts from around the world			0
indeed , professor @entity9 had said that he was surprised to receive emails from the @entity180 people who were watching the experiment online			1
as more drops fall the gaps between them will grow , so the next drop could be the last one for decades			1
the oldest known pitch drop experiment began in 1927 by professor @entity14			1
the first drop fell a decade later			0
professor @entity9 ( centre ) was custodian of the test since the 1960s but missed every drop the last drop to fall during @entity9 's @entity58 experiment was missed because the camera was turned off professor @entity9 is now custodian of the experiment that is on public display at the @entity12 in @entity168 , @entity58			1
since starting at the university in the early 60s he has missed all five drops that have fallen			2
he hopes to be present when the next one - which has grown into a perfect teardrop shape - finally falls from the funnel			0

recalling a conversation with @entity14 's son , professor @entity9 once said : ‘ other people in the physics department did n't take much interest in it			2
the students probably laughed at him			0
‘ it became something of a real oddity and was hidden away in a cupboard and when i started i had to convict the department to put it on display			0
there were people who thought it should just be thrown out			0
professor @entity14 ( 1881 - 1948 ) , conceived the now famous @entity58 @entity9 @entity14 as a lieutenant in the @entity237 , serving in @entity238 during the latter part of @entity240 and into 1919 the earlier drops that fell during the @entity58 experiment have now flattened ‘ before he died in 1948 , @entity14 would have been there for two drops , so i 've been there for many more than him			1
but no one has ever actually watched one fall			0
‘ the last time it happened i was in @entity248 and i got an email saying it was getting close , but i was n't worried because we had a camera on it			0
‘ then i got an email to say it had happened , which was followed by another email to say the camera had not worked			0
hopefully the technology is better now			0
‘ the closest i have been to seeing a drop live is five minutes away , and on another occasion i left the university thinking it would not drop at least until the next day , but when when i arrived in the morning it had happened			0
‘ it is very difficult to judge when it is going to drop			0
but as it gets nearer the pitch hangs by filaments and when one of those breaks it goes			0
‘ pitch is not a homogeneous substance and is a complex mix of hydrocarbons so it is difficult to predict what will happen , especially as the conditions have changed with the introduction of air conditioning			0
‘ people from around the world get in touch about it - and not just from @entity283 speaking countries			0
‘ i 've even had emails from @entity180 people			0
there really are pitch drop devotees			2
‘ former students come back to the university with their children and grandchildren and look at the experiment and say it looks exactly the same			0
' he added : ‘ i hope it continues to run after i 'm gone , i think there are another 100 years left and the gaps between drops will get longer and longer			2

the experiment began in 1924 in a bid to prove pitch , or tar , is a liquid
only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping
@entity9 , who oversaw the study , died last week aged 78 of a stroke
earlier this year he said the next drop would fall by the end of this year
