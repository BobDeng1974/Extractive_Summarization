@entity6 and @entity8 's characters in the 2000 film would 've been left trailing in the wake of today 's fleet of foot thieves , according to a new report released yesterday			2
and @entity15 are top of car thieves ’ shopping lists with 150,000 cars are stolen each year and two thirds of these taken with their keys			1
black @entity22 are the most popular car targeted by thieves the study by criminologists for @entity28 = car insurance reveals that forced ignition thefts have fallen massively over the past decade , with criminals now preferring to steal the keys and then drive away			1
this has drastically reduced the time it takes the average car thief to make a slick getaway by more than six times			0
the report , which includes interviews with car crime victims and convicted car thieves , shows that car thefts where the perpetrator steals the keys now account for nearly two thirds of all cars stolen			1
in just under half of the thefts the car keys are stolen from the owner ’s home during a burglary , although six per cent of victims had their keys taken forcibly from them before the thief drove away in their car			2
black or silver @entity56 like the one pictured are also among the most sought after cars by thieves official figures show that 88,103 cars were stolen in 2011/12 but these do not account for car theft as a result of burglary , which goes undocumented			1
as a result , it is estimated that up to 4o per cent of car thefts go unreported as they are classified as burglary ( because the keys were taken from the house ) , which would equate to an additional 58,735 motor thefts this year - bringing the total to 146,838			1
modern car security functions have resulted in car thieves adopting more inventive means of stealing vehicles - some of which appear to be straight out of a movie script			1
yellow smart cars like the one pictured are avoided by thieves - they are the least likely to be stolen according to figures cases of ‘ lifting ’ - where the vehicle is lifted onto the back of a truck - have increased steadily since 2009 , and accounted for around 12 per cent of car thefts in 2011 and 14 per cent of thefts so far in 2012			1
one criminal confessed : ' i ’ve lifted cars in broad daylight			0
flat bed truck and a luminous vest and people think you ’re a clamper			0
they ’re lifting more for tax and insurance now , so as long as you look the part no - one cares			0
' many cars are now stolen to order , with criminals purposely targeting high - end makes and models , in popular colours			0
@entity6 and @entity8 's characters in the 2000 film gone in @entity112 are slow in comparison to the modern car thief who can steal a car in as little as ten seconds according to thieves the most sought after cars are black @entity118 , silver and black bmws with the least popular being yellow smart cars			1
thieves also keep their eyes peeled for features such as air conditioning , alloy wheels , cd players , metallic paint and integrated sat navs			0
the highest number of recorded car thefts by police force 2011/12 : the report adds that the majority of stolen cars are never recovered			1
a small number are sold directly to a @entity137 buyer the thief knows or via an online auction site but most seem to disappear altogether			2
many cars end up being stripped down into spare parts , ' a car is worth ten times more in bits than it is as a whole , ' according to one criminal			0
some cars are shipped overseas , mainly to @entity148 , in lead - lined containers that prevent tracker signals from working			0
@entity152 , managing director of @entity28 = car insurance said : ' improvements in car security mean that criminals now place a greater emphasis on stealing the keys rather than forcing the ignition			0
' there are some basic things that motorists can do to try and prevent theft , such as parking in well lit areas , fitting the car with security devices , and keeping car keys out of sight and out of reach			0
