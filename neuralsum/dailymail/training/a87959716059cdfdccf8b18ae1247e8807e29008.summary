by @entity0 when alleged drug dealer and jazz saxophonist , @entity3 was arrested in february , 2014 , accused of selling 73 bags of heroin – the last deadly hit -- to the @entity11 - winning actor , @entity2 , there was no question who @entity3 ’s lawyer was going to call : bail bondsman to the stars @entity17			1
@entity3 had been sent to @entity19 prison where he sat for two weeks , sleepless and sick while kicking his heroin habit			1
bail was set at $ 200,000 -- over $ 40,000 cash -- for the musician who got out of jail when @entity17 , known as @entity25 , posted his bond			1
@entity3 faces three felony charges that could deliver 25 years behind bars as well as deportation back to @entity30 where he grew up			1
before the fall : revered actor @entity2 's lifeless body was found in his @entity34 apartment on february 2 with envelopes branded ' @entity36 out on bail : thanks to @entity39 , accused heroin dealer in the @entity2 case @entity3 was released after rotting in jail for two weeks but for now at least , he ’s free			1
whether it ’s a celebrity , a mobster , an athlete , a drug dealer or the ‘ millionaire ’ madam @entity45 , in @entity48 ’s phone number is the one to have in your black book			1
he knows how to rattle the cages of judges , lawyers and cops to bail his celebrity and common criminal clients out of big jams and out of jail			1
with a client list including @entity62 football players @entity60 and @entity63 , rappers @entity64 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , notorious @entity34 madam @entity69 , and former @entity71 chief @entity70 , @entity17 is the macher — a schemer with many plans -- he writes in his upcoming book , @entity25 , soon to be published by @entity76			1
‘ i do n’t chase bad guys			0
they mostly come to me because i lend them money at a rate			0
it ’s not exactly free			2
i ’m like a legal loan shark ’ , @entity17 writes			1
was he wearing his calvins ? @entity17 was called to bail out @entity84 's ex-lover , @entity83 , when the former erotic model was busted in april 2012 on a drug charge -- hiding cocaine in his underwear when good guys or bad guys , mob guys or white collar guys are caught doing something illegal , they ’re in the system and usually need to put up their house , business or property as a guarantee they wo n’t skip town on their bail			1
that has to be done through a licensed bondsman who gets a percentage of the bond			2
if the client does a runner , the bondsman loses his fee and could be responsible for the full amount of the bail			1
the fee in @entity112 is a 6 - 8 - 10 percent structure ; the higher the bail the lower the percentage			2
‘ it ’s like a blood oath , because if you f * * * with me , you f * * * with my living			2
you f * * * with my family ’ , the author says			0
‘ i might be the only person keeping you from getting sucked up in the injustice system			0
i know who to touch for a favor to make sure your time inside goes easy , which judges might let you slide and which ones have zero tolerance			0
‘ i have a direct line to white - shoe lawyers who ’ll work pro bono … and i know the cops and the @entity133 who believe in second chances			0
so yeah … i guess i ’m a macher			2
it ’s my job to make things happen			2
it ’s my job to get you out of jail ’			1
