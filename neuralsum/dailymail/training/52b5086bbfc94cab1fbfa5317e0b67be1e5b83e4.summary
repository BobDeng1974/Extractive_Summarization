@entity0 have been left sweating on the fitness of @entity2 after the striker was sent for a second ankle scan			1
manager @entity5 may be forced to revive his interest in @entity7 or scrap the £ 10million sale of @entity9 if the @entity11 international striker is ruled out for any length of time			1
@entity14 understands that @entity2 , who sustained the injury during the closing stages of saturday ’s 2 - 2 draw against @entity18 , will miss at least the next two weeks and there are even fears he has suffered a broken foot , which would rule him out for months rather than weeks			1
crocked : @entity2 went down against @entity18 and he will have a second scan on his injured ankle ecstasy to agony : @entity2 had equalised with a bullet header moments before suffering the injury reinforcements : @entity5 may make a move for @entity7 to replace the injured @entity2 @entity2 originally believed he could be fit for wednesday ’s make - or - break @entity30 qualifier against @entity32 , but he is now set to miss the second leg against @entity35 's side			1
an initial scan failed to clear up the extent of the damage and @entity2 was sent for a second examination after the inflammation of the joint had fully subsided			0
a long term lay - off for @entity2 , the club ’s first - choice striker , would leave the club desperately short of centre - forward options and force @entity5 ’s hand in the transfer market			1
back of the net : the @entity11 striker scored for @entity0 against @entity18 but may have broken his foot if the @entity11 is sidelined for a sustained period of time , then @entity5 could revive their interest in @entity55 striker @entity7			1
the striker was close to joining the @entity57 earlier this summer , with the north @entity59 club willing to meet his £ 8.5million release clause			0
but @entity0 ’s refusal to match his £ 90,000 - per - week wage demands saw the deal fall through			0
@entity2 ’s injury could also force the club into a rethink over @entity9 ’s future			1
on his way ? @entity9 ( right ) was thought to be leaving @entity0 , but an injury to @entity2 could see him stay the @entity70 international wanted to leave the club in search of first - team football , and @entity5 has given him the green light to depart so long as a club meets his £ 10million asking price			1
but a serious injury to @entity2 could yet see @entity9 , who is wanted by @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 , stay at the @entity81			2
the club were faced with a similar scenario last season when dealing with @entity85 ’s broken foot			2
following a 50/50 challenge with @entity88 while playing for @entity89 in march , the midfielder was given the all clear during an initial scan on his ankle			0
but a second scan showed up a hairline fracture to his left foot			0
desperate times : @entity5 has been reluctant to buy another striker , but he may now be forced to do so and the club will wait for clarification on @entity2 ’s second scan before fully disclosing the details of his injury			2
@entity5 will address the issue at tuesday ’s pre-match press conference ahead of wednesday 's @entity32 clash			2
@entity2 ’s fitness is n’t the only selection headache for @entity5 , who will also be without the suspended @entity108 following his red card in the first leg , and captain @entity111 who is still suffering with an ankle injury			0
@entity111 is expected to be available for the @entity115 showdown against @entity116 on september 13 , while @entity117 is expected to return to the squad for the clash against @entity32 after a hamstring problem			0
but it is @entity2 ’s injury that is causing wenger the biggest concern			0
like our dedicated @entity124 here .			0

@entity2 went down injured against @entity18 on saturday
a first scan was *inconclusive* , so the @entity11 will be *tested* again
@entity0 fear the striker may have broken his foot
a period out for @entity2 could force @entity0 to sign @entity55 's @entity7
@entity2 is @entity0 's first - choice striker , and will certainly miss the *crunch* @entity30 qualifier against @entity32 on wednesday
forward @entity9 was set to leave the club , but may now stay
