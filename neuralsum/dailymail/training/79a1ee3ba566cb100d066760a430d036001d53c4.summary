host commentator an awful second half from @entity2 , who started so positively			1
a blow to their @entity6 credentials already ? not quite , but this just proves buying attackers does n't always mean results ... 86mins : slight chance for @entity11 but his header goes voer the bar from the corner			2
real have really thrown this away , and it 's a former @entity19 man who finishes them off ... surely			0
the forward chests the ball down from a corner and fires a volley into the roof of the net			1
74mins : sociedad holding firm			0
ca n't believe this is the same side we saw in the first half ! can you believe this ? what a turnaround ! it 's that man @entity36 again who gets in front of @entity38 to convert a drilled cross from @entity40			1
no chance for @entity42 , but what a story this is			2
57mins : real just not playing at the same pace right now			0
@entity45 misplaces a cross from the right after a slow break , while @entity49 does n't seem to know his place in this side			1
53mins : in contrast to the start of the first half , @entity28 are well on top now			1
much more energy , and it does help when the fans are n't getting on your back i 'm sure ! 48mins : @entity28 nearly take the lead ! @entity62 gets up for a free header , with @entity42 rushing out , and luckily for the keeper the ball canons off his thigh and out for a corner			1
what an entertaining first - half that was ! strange how a game can change on its head so quickly			2
the visitors started so well , looking like they 'd make double figures before half - time , but two wonderful crosses later and @entity28 are level			1
more to come , folks ! very much game on ! what was i thinking writing the hosts off ? @entity36 is as brave as can be as he nets his diving header , benefiting from another wonderful cross			1
trouble in paradise for the visitors			0
game on ! not sure @entity28 have deserved this , but i 'll take it ! fantastic corner from the right , @entity87 flicks it on at the near post and @entity91 taps in at the back			2
still think @entity2 have got more goals in them , though ... 33mins : real go close again			2
suicidal defending from the hosts , who lose it 30 yards from goal			0
the boys in pink pounce and @entity100 should have done better after being slid through on goal			2
decent save from the keeper again , mind			0
27mins : finally a dangerous attack from the hosts , but what a block by @entity108 ! @entity109 meets a knock down with a fierce volley from 10 yards out but the defender throws his body in the way to get it clear			1
he 's having an alright game , is n't he ? 24mins : real just look so dangerous going forward			0
it 's @entity116 again who gets the final shot away this time , but it 's well saved by @entity119			1
all coming down that left - hand side			0
20mins : it nearly gets worse for the hosts			0
@entity123 plays a poor back pass and goalkeeper @entity119 gets lucky when jumping up for a header with @entity126			1
seconds later @entity116 's effort flies just wide			2
17mins : @entity45 now joining @entity126 up front , making this very much a 4 - 4 - 2			1
@entity49 , who has hardly been involved , is now on the left and @entity133 right			1
ca n't see the hosts getting into this one somehow , these ' new @entity134 ' look brilliant			0
11mins : @entity136 , just brilliant from @entity45			0
the winger receives the ball into feet , nutmegs the defender , then places his effort into the bottom corner			1
9mins : @entity108 nearly makes it two ! this time the centre back ( yes , centre back ) crashes his free - kick against the post			2
ideal start for the visitors , but a blow for @entity28 ( and the neutrals ! )			2
@entity108 is inexcusably left unmarked at the corner and makes no mistake in powering his header into the bottom corner			1
uphill task for the hosts now			0
4mins : early look at this @entity2 formation , and it 's @entity45 on the left , @entity133 behind @entity126 and @entity49 right			1
plenty of options should they want to change it though			0
away we go ! real all in pink tonight			0
or should i say ' @entity166 ' @entity167 : @entity2 have held further conversations with @entity169 as they press to take @entity170 on loan			0
the @entity173 striker will leave @entity169 on monday and the @entity174 is looking increasingly like his next destination			0
real , who have @entity126 as their only recognised centre forward , opened discussions on saturday with the player being informed of their interest while returning from saturday 's game with @entity183			0
@entity184 rested tonight to avoid further injuries , he 'll have three weeks off			1
@entity186 certainly has other options though			0
@entity49 , @entity133 and @entity45 start behind @entity126 , with @entity188 and @entity100 behind them			1
@entity191 scores to put @entity192 1 - 0 up against @entity193			0
what have you got now , real ? kick - off is 20 minutes away			0
@entity119 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity109 , @entity62 , @entity200 , @entity36 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 @entity42 , @entity204 , @entity38 , @entity108 , @entity116 , @entity100 , @entity188 , @entity49 , @entity133 , @entity45 , @entity126 @entity192 are in action at the moment , drawing 0 - 0 against @entity193 ... but what about @entity2 ? they kick off at 8pm against @entity28 , and team news is now filtering in			1

@entity108 meets corner in fifth minute to put visitors in front
@entity45 nutmegs defender and slots the ball into bottom corner for second
defender @entity219 nets after well worked set - piece from the hosts
@entity36 nets brave diving header to *equalise*
completes unlikely turnaround ( for now ) in second half
@entity227 comes off the bench to net *fourth*
