what did the humans enjoy drinking - and use to get merry - 9,000 years ago ? that ’s the question an ‘ alcohol archaeologist ’ has been attempting to answer , by tracing back some of the world ’s most ancient brews			1
by analysing the residues found on fragments of pottery and studying references in texts , he has managed to recreate a number of ancient beers and wines that were all but lost to history			1
dr @entity16 from the @entity17 has been creating ancient alcoholic drinks			1
he collects residues from containers to recreate the drinks			1
the oldest he has made so far dates back 9,000 years in @entity22 , while another called @entity23 ( shown ) is believed to have been drunk by @entity24 himself the beverages were brewed by @entity27 in @entity28 , who worked with dr @entity16 of the @entity17			1
to reveal what ingredients were needed , dr @entity16 analysed residues found at various archaeological sites around the world			1
he detected traces of various ingredients left by the drinks - including barley , honey , herbs and spices - using a number of methods including liquid chromatography , gas chromatography and mass spectrometry			1
the first drink that he recreated is named the @entity23 , and is based on molecular evidence from residues found inside a @entity52 tomb , believed to have belonged to @entity24 , dating back to 700 bc. a variety of alcoholic residues have been found inside important tombs around the world - suggesting that they were drinks used during celebrations or rituals and perhaps even to wish good luck to the dead in the afterlife			1
the sweet and dry @entity23 beer is made using honey , barley malt , white muscat grapes and saffron			0
the oldest beer that dr @entity16 brewed is entitled @entity69 , the ingredients for which were discovered inside a 9,000 - year - old tomb in @entity22			1
@entity23 somewhere between beer , wine and mead , this drink is based on molecular evidence found in a @entity52 tomb believed to have belonged to @entity24 , dating back to 700 bc. it ’s a sweet yet dry beer made with honey , barley malt , white muscat grapes and saffron			2
@entity69 this 9,000 - year - old @entity83 drink is made with hawthorn fruit , @entity83 wild grapes , rice and honey			1
it is the oldest known fermented beverage in history			0
@entity90 found in @entity92 , @entity91 is brewed with artisanal dark chocolate from the ancient cacao area of @entity95 , honey , chilies , corn and annatto or achiote ( fragrant and reddish , imitating sacrificial blood )			2
it dates back 3,400 years , based on chemical analysis of pottery fragments found in @entity92 which contained the earliest chocolate beverage from the @entity107			1
. @entity108 the ingredients of this drink are based on chemical and botanical analyses of @entity114 's oldest known wine ( about 3150 bc ) and other sites dating back 18,000 years , in addition to ancient @entity114 hieroglyphic inscriptions and artistic depictions of brewing			1
it uses an ancient species of wheat ( einkorn ) for hearth - baked bread , with added chamomile , doum palm fruit and @entity127 herbs			2
@entity128 this 2,800 - year - old drink uses two - row malted barley and an heirloom @entity132 wheat			0
it heralds from @entity132 and also contains speciality ingredients such as hazelnuts , pomegranates , @entity132 chestnut honey and wildflower and clover honeys from @entity28 , and myrrh			0
the @entity27 version was brewed with bronze ( replicating the ancient vessels made of this metal alloy ) ; the @entity132 versions were brewed in replica @entity148 pottery jars and oak barrels			2
@entity151 chemical , botanical and pollen evidence are the basis for this ' @entity156 grog , ' which is attested at sites in @entity158 and @entity159 from the @entity160 to @entity161			0
the contents of a 3,500 - year - old @entity159 drinking vessel exemplifies this drink			0
the vessel was made of birch bark and found in the tomb of a leather and woollen - clad woman , who was possibly a priestess			2
the ingredients are sourced from the far north : red winter wheat , lingonberries , cranberries , bog myrtle ( @entity177 gale ) , yarrow , honey , juniper , and birch syrup			0
imported wine from southern and central @entity183 was also added to the bracing northern brew			0
it is made using hawthorn fruit , @entity83 wild grapes , rice and honey , and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine			1
while most simply involve the mixing of ingredients for fermentation , others required slightly more bizarre production methods			2
for example , to make @entity69 , corn must be milled and moistened in the maker ’s mouth to convert starches in the corn into fermentable sugars - before it is ‘ spat ’ into the beer			2
‘ all the drinks are centred around natural products of the regions , ’ dr @entity16 told @entity208			1
‘ these drinks represent speciality upper class beverages , used in kinds of ceremonies , religious rites festivals			0
' but in some places and periods , such as the more democratised @entity220 , the general populace seem to have enjoyed them , too			0
' white muscat grapes , stock image pictured , are used in the creation of the @entity23 drink - along with honey , barley malt and saffron - to create a sweet yet dry beer dr @entity16 is pictured left , with @entity229 from @entity27 , in the process of making one of the ancient drinks			1
shown right is a birch - bark bucket found in @entity159 , which archaeobotanical evidence revealed to contain ' @entity156 grog ' dating back up to 1,500 years the oldest drink made by dr @entity16 and @entity27 is @entity69 ( shown ) , the ingredients for which were found in a 9,000 - year - old tomb in @entity22			1
it is made from hawthorn fruit , @entity83 wild grapes , rice and honey , and is the oldest known fermented beverage in history - older even than wine dr @entity16 likens them to expensive cocktails today			1
in particular , in northern @entity183 it was not possible to make wine , so it had to be imported from central or southern @entity183 , making it an expensive beverage			2
‘ you had a great deal of social elite value to it , ’ he said			0
‘ just like today , you serve a fancy bottle of wine , but only certain [ people ] can afford it to impress the neighbours , it was the same thing in antiquity			2
’ with regards to finding the recipes to make the drinks , dr @entity16 has scoured texts to find out the various ingredients			1
but he also gathers residues from certain ancient containers			2
‘ sometimes i ’m just fortunate [ in finding them ] , sometimes it took me on a grand tour , ’ he said			0
the residues are n’t always visible , though ; most get absorbed into pottery , and must be extracted in a complicated process using solvents			0
the drink called @entity280 relied on ingredients from @entity114 hieroglyphics			0
it uses an ancient species of wheat for hearth - baked bread , with added chamomile , doum palm fruit ( shown ) and @entity127 herbs pictured is an @entity161 imported drinking - set , comprised of a bucket ( situla ) , a ladle and strainer - cup nested together , and several ' sauce pans ' or drinking cups , from a hoard under the floor of a settlement at @entity299 , @entity158 in the southern part of the island of @entity302 in the @entity303 , from the first century ad a young blond woman , believed to be a priestess , was buried in an oak trunk coffin under a mound at @entity309 in @entity310 , @entity159 between 1500 and 1300 bc. she was found with the birch - bark bucket pictured earlier			0
wrapped in a cow hide , she wears a dancer ’s tasseled dress with a large bronze bronze disk a 30 - year - old woman was laid to rest in a wood coffin at @entity319 , @entity159 around 200 @entity320 , shown			0
together with cosmetic items and jewelry , the woman held a long - handled bronze strainer - cup in her right hand , part of an imported @entity161 wine - set , including a bucket , ladle and incised glass beaker behind her head dr @entity16 said his favourite is @entity69 , the oldest of the lot he has made , dating back 9,000 years			1
‘ that ’s the one that i identify with most , ’ he said			0
' it goes well with @entity339 food , it has a sweet and sour profile			0
' based on botanical evidence , dr @entity16 believes there may be an even older @entity114 drink from 16,000 @entity320 that could be made , and that it is likely humans have been making alcoholic drinks for much , much longer			1
‘ all animals are attracted to sugar and alcohol : insects , fruit fly , elephants , ’ he said			0
‘ humans would have known how to make an alcoholic beverage right from the beginning			0

dr @entity16 from the @entity17 has been creating ancient alcoholic drinks
he collects residues from containers to recreate the drinks
the oldest he has made so far dates back 9,000 years in @entity22
some involve odd methods - such as *chewing* and *spitting* corn
he says the drinks were likely expensive and enjoyed by *affluent* people
but today people can *buy* and make the drinks themselves
