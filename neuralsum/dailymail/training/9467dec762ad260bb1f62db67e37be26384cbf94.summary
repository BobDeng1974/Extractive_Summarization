by @entity1 reporter published : 21:00 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 03:48 est , 27 september 2012 the billionaire family of a @entity4 energy drink heir accused of killing a police officer in a hit - and - run accident have paid the officer 's siblings about $ 100,000 in a deal that may avoid a civil lawsuit			1
@entity11 , 27 , is charged with driving a @entity12 that struck the officer and dragged his body down a @entity16 street earlier this month			1
the @entity11 family paid the officer 's siblings 3 million baht ( $ 97,000 ) last week , police lt. col. @entity17 said			1
he said the settlement will protect @entity11 from a civil lawsuit			0
if the victim 's party is satisfied with the amount of money , then they will not seek compensation through a court , ' @entity17 said			0
the payment , however , does not protect @entity11 from criminal charges of causing death by reckless driving and fleeing to avoid arrest			2
if convicted , @entity11 , the grandson of the late @entity4 creator @entity49 , faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of 20,000 baht ( $ 666 )			2
the payment from the extremely wealthy family is also unlikely to quell public outrage over the incident and an initial attempt to cover up @entity11 's alleged involvement by arresting a bogus suspect			1
the family was ranked fourth richest in the country this year by @entity61 with a net worth of $ 5.4 billion			1
@entity11 's grandfather @entity49 ( left ) , the founder of the energy drink @entity4 , died in his 80s in march , leaving his heirs a wide range of businesses they own a wide range of businesses , including shares in the energy drink brand , hospitals , real estate and the sole authorized importer of @entity12 cars in @entity78			2
the car involved in the accident was valued at about 30 million baht ( $ 1 million )			2
' 3 million baht is too little ... how could a sports car be more expensive than a man 's life ? ' a commentator said on a popular @entity78 web forum , pantip.com			1
' his wrecked @entity12 should have been sold and the money should be added to the compensation money , ' another forum user wrote			0
it is not uncommon for the rich and privileged to get away with crimes in @entity78			0
though there is no suggestion @entity11 is trying to escape justice or that the authorities are not taking the matter seriously			0
investigators are waiting for forensic test results before possibly adding more charges against @entity11 , including speeding , drunken driving and drug use			0
no date has been set for a trial .			0

@entity11 accused of driving $ 1m @entity12 in @entity16 hit - and - run
police say ' funeral fee ' will stop officer 's family from seeking compensation
the payment , a *fraction* of the value of the car involved , is unlikely to quell public anger over crash
@entity11 family ranked fourth richest in @entity78 with net worth of $ 5.4bn
