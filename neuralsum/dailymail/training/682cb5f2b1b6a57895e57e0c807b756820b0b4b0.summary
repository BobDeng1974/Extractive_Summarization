having fun ? the whales are seen in the water with a rainbow overhead putting on a show ! one whale swam close to whale watchers @entity53 ! the whales delighted the onlookers ' i love wildlife and i have traveled to many places around the world - but this was probably one of the most magical things i have seen			1
' you are able to get very close to them and it seems they are just as curious about us as we are about them			0

' and although the injury is healed it serves as a permanent reminder that boaters need to be " whale wise "			2
' we need to slow down and stay out of the path of whales so we can continue to experience them and enjoy the beautiful whale rain - blows			0
