while the @entity20 has long tracked deaths from heart disease , it never previously issued a report estimating how many such deaths could be prevented			2
and the research revealed worrying discrepancies along lines of gender and race with the 2010 rate of avoidable deaths in black men about 80 percent higher than that of white men and black women			1
in 2010 , the states with the highest avoidable death rates were located primarily in the @entity53 , including @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , the report stated			1

there were widespread differences in rates by age , geographical region , race and gender , @entity79 said			0
