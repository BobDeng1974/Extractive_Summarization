' during the summer there can be a bit of trouble with people parking on the grass verges and that 's what they 're trying to stop ' said one neighbour , who asked not to be named			1
' but nothing so bad as to warrant so many signs in one mile			2
they are lining the road , even opposite each other - it seems like a crazy and unnecessary expense			0
' the campaign to @entity50 says around two thirds of signs in rural areas are unnecessary			2
the group has been lobbying since 1996 for local authorities , including @entity12 , to ditch pointless roadside clutter and their campaign led to 170 of 900 signs being pulled down last year in another @entity60 village , @entity61			1
spokesman @entity62 said it was disappointing to hear the same authority had decided to erect 63 signs in a single lane			1
he said : ' we have been running a campaign since 1996 to de-clutter the countryside in terms of unnecessary road signs			2
' so it 's disappointing to hear about just how many signs have been erected along this road			2
' it sounds like utter nonsense , but someone , somewhere has come up with the rationale for this			0
' local councillor @entity80 said locals were shocked by the number of signs that suddenly sprang up before @entity84			0

' i think many residents are concerned with just how many signs have been erected			0
' there have been talks going on and the parish council is trying to see if they can change the amount of signs			0
' ms @entity96 said she had asked the council 's portfolio holder for @entity99 , @entity100 , to come and take a look at the signs			0
' he was of the same opinion as me and could n't understand why so many are needed , ' she said			0
@entity12 said the notices were essential to enforce seasonal parking restrictions that run from june 1 to sept 30			1
in some places the road runs just a few hundred metres from the beach , and is also close to popular rambling route the @entity114			0
however , the unitary authority has agreed to consider ' alternative parking management options ' that could eventually see some of them removed			0
a spokesman said : ' this is likely to require changes to the operational times of the parking restrictions in the village , and a statutory consultation process will be required and must be satisfactorily completed before any changes to signing can take place			0
' the operation of parking restrictions at the same time in the village is likely to result in the need for fewer signs which will look better and will not impact on enforcement operations			1
