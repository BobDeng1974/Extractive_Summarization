@entity1 striker @entity0 is targeting a perfect finish to the season to pile the pressure on @entity6 title contenders @entity7 and @entity8			1
the @entity9 kept up the heat on leaders @entity7 and second - placed @entity8 on saturday evening following their hard - fought 2 - 1 victory at @entity13			1
two seasons ago , @entity15 's men responded to their @entity18 exit by putting together a run of eight wins and two draws in their final 10 league games and , having succumbed to @entity23 last tuesday evening , @entity0 is looking for a similar surge towards the finishing line			1
@entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) congratulate @entity0 after his second goal he told the club 's official website www.arsenal.com : ' it 's nice for the team because we are on a really good run , even if we were disappointed about the @entity18			2
we want to finish really strongly and finish in the best position by winning every single game			0
' there are still eight games to play , so we need to focus on our games and step by step we 're going to see			0
first we need to win every single game and then after we need to see if @entity8 or @entity7 miss one of these steps			1
' you never know , you have to believe in football and that 's why we want to win every single game			2
' @entity0 gives @entity1 the lead in the 28th minute at @entity13 , latching onto @entity48 's header the @entity50 striker celebrates his first goal of the game with team - mates @entity53 and @entity48 ( right ) @entity0 holds off his marker to head @entity1 into a two - goal lead just four minutes after opening the scoring the victory at @entity60 extended @entity1 's winning league run to six games and , while it looked as though it would arrive in routine style after @entity0 's first - half double , they were ultimately grateful for the excellence of goalkeeper @entity67 , who produced a series of second - half saves to keep the resurgent @entity70 at bay			1
@entity0 opened the scoring with 24 minutes gone when he bundled home @entity48 's flick - on from a @entity76 free - kick and he extended the lead just four minutes later when he made the most of some insipid defending to head @entity76 's corner past @entity80			2
however , @entity81 reduced the deficit within three minutes of the restart when he swept home @entity86 's cross and , had @entity87 not managed to beat away a @entity89 header and @entity90 's deflected 87th - minute shot , the home side would have emerged with a point			2
@entity81 points to the sky as he celebrates scoring @entity13 's first @entity6 goal since february 28 @entity0 , who now has nine goals in his last nine games in all competitions , salutes @entity1 's travelling fans @entity1 look dejected during their disappointing performance against @entity23 in the @entity18 @entity15 said : ' i would say the spirit of the team and the quality of the players , the mental quality of the players - they are outstanding guys and it 's a pleasure to see how they behave			1
it 's a credit to the club as well to see that quality on the behavioural front and how much they want to do well			0
' we are a stronger team today than we were in september - that 's down to the focus of the whole club , of the whole staff and the quality of work the whole staff puts in			0
' let 's hope we can go from strength to strength now until the end of the season			0
' there were positives too for @entity70 coach @entity131 , who was forced to field a makeshift defence as injury and suspension took their toll , despite the fact that former boss @entity139 's @entity138 leapfrogged his team as a result of their 2 - 1 win at @entity144			1
@entity1 boss @entity15 gives out instructions during his side 's sixth successive @entity6 victory his concentration swiftly turned to the @entity149 on april 5 , a game he can not afford to lose after four successive defeats by @entity152 , whose need is even more pressing as they find themselves entrenched in another fight for top - flight survival			1
@entity131 said : ' it 's good to put in a good performance just before a derby game and we have already touched on it because our preparation starts now for it and we have got to get focused for it because we have not had a win against them for a while			0
' it 's very important that we are focused for it , and we will have a normal week			0
there is no time off this week , we will have a normal week - monday , tuesday , off wednesday , in thursday , friday - so our preparation starts now and we know it 's a big game			0

@entity1 beat @entity13 2 - 1 on saturday to keep up with the leaders
@entity0 scored twice to secure @entity1 's sixth *straight* league win
