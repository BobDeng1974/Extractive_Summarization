today , judge @entity14 said @entity0 's prison term was limited by the laws at the time and the fact @entity0 pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
speaking outside court , miss @entity2 's father , @entity22 , said he was ' disgusted ' by the sentence , but did not blame the judge			2
he believes @entity0 manipulated the legal system and says he hopes @entity0 ' rots ' for what he has done			1
mr @entity29 said : ' he brutally killed @entity2 - our @entity2 - and left her buried in the ground for 14 years			1
we served that 14 years			1
he has 11 ( left ) to serve			0
we believe he has manipulated the system			0
' jailing @entity0 for a minimum 12 years at @entity35 today , judge @entity34 said : ' the killing of @entity2 was brutal			1
your treatment of her body after death was dreadful			0
but your culpability was considerably diminished by your mental illness			0
' the court heard @entity0 had been sectioned in a mental hospital for around nine months in august 1999 and was released around six weeks before he killed miss @entity2			1
@entity45 , prosecuting , told the court @entity0 launched a ' frenzied ' attack in which he repeatedly struck miss @entity2 with a hammer and then stabbed her in the back and neck an ' uncountable ' number of times with a kitchen knife			1
@entity0 then filled a bath with water and left miss @entity2 in it for four days with her hands tied behind her back because he was ' frightened she would come back to life '			1
mr @entity60 said @entity0 closed the shower curtain so he did not have to see the body and repainted his flat with lilac paint to cover the blood stains			2
he hired a car but found he could not fit miss @entity2 's body in the boot , so he sawed off the bottom of his victim 's legs			1
@entity0 , who has been diagnosed with a psychotic illness , told police he did this ' as fast as i could so i was n't sick '			2
he wrapped miss @entity2 's body in a sleeping bag and secured it with chains and a padlock ' so she could n't get out '			2
@entity2 ( left ) was killed in may 2000			2
her father , @entity22 , ( right ) today slammed the sentence handed to her killer , who he claimed had manipulated the legal system @entity0 then drove her to @entity85 , near @entity12 , @entity13 , where he dug a hole with a shovel and buried her			1
mr @entity60 told the court that @entity0 , who was 30 at the time of the attack , had known miss @entity2 for around five years			1
on the day of her death , the pair met at @entity35 railway station before going back to @entity0 's flat in @entity12			2
@entity0 was questioned by police after miss @entity2 was reported missing and said the young woman had called him to ask if she could stay with him but he had not seen her that day			2
in july this year , @entity0 rang a former girlfriend and told her he had killed someone 14 years ago			1
he then handed himself in at @entity100 police station			0
during his interviews , @entity0 took police to @entity85 and showed them where he had buried @entity103 , and her remains were recovered			2
he said he had visited the site four or fives times since miss @entity2 's death			0
police forensic teams at @entity85 near @entity35 earlier this year , after miss @entity2 's body was found @entity0 told police he had considered confessing in the past but his mother was still alive and he was concerned about losing his freedom			1
@entity115 , defending @entity0 , told the court the defendant heard voices telling him to do things and had ' developed complex delusional beliefs ' which saw him moving around the country because he believed a group of men were trying to kill him			0
mr @entity124 said the doctor who discharged @entity0 in 2000 accepted that the delusions had not disappeared at that stage			0
a psychiatric report carried out after @entity0 's arrest diagnosed his mental illness as schizophrenia			2
judge @entity34 earlier told the court it was a difficult and unique sentencing exercise as he had to consider the law as it was 14 years ago and , also , the fact that @entity0 is not currently showing the psychotic illness he was suffering from at the time			1
the judge also noted he has not committed any acts of serious violence since he killed miss @entity2			0
@entity142 's father , who was comforted by his daughter @entity143 , said outside court : ' all we can say now is we hope he rots			0
' police searched @entity0 's home in @entity12 , @entity13 after he confided to a friend about the killing the family issued a statement through @entity146 which said : ' @entity2 was a young woman in the prime of her life who raised a smile and lit up every room she entered			1
' her family will never come to terms with the loss of @entity2			0
we are victims as well			0
' they added : ' there is no sentence which can be imposed which will reduce the pain and suffering @entity0 has caused @entity2 's family during the past 14 years , whilst all the time he was leading a normal life			1
' he left us in limbo for each one of those years			0
a total of nearly 5,000 days of pain in which we worried constantly for @entity2 and her wellbeing			0
' that chill in our hearts became an integral , perpetual part of our lives and the knowledge that @entity0 could watch all of our and the police 's efforts to find her while going on with his own affairs for so long quite simply beggars belief			0
' while we now know what happened to our daughter , there is a shadow on our lives which will never be lifted and @entity0 is the cause of that			0
' our beautiful @entity2 was a bright shining light in our world			0
a light which @entity0 extinguished			0
