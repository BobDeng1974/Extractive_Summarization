cruel online trolls could face @entity2 charges if they refuse to remove offensive posts after being handed warnings as part of a government battle against cyber bullying			1
social media giants such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will also face charges if they fail to comply with new rules about removing hurtful comments			1
parliamentary secretary to the minister for communications @entity14 announced new laws will be brought in by the end of the year and will provide the government with the ‘ ability to serve notices to bullies ’			1
he explained how children , parents and teachers are often ‘ unsure of what to do when they have been the victim of cyber-bullying ’			0
‘ @entity37 can have very serious effects , including anxiety , depression , behavioural problems and even suicidal thoughts , ’ mr @entity14 said			0
he pointed out how ‘ the posting of humiliating or harmful photos , videos , or rumours is often exacerbated by other social media features ( such as ‘ comments ’ , ‘ shares ’ and ‘ likes ’ ) which can rapidly promote and spread the damaging content ’			1
social media giants such as @entity9 , @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) will also face charges if they fail to comply with new rules about removing hurtful comments @entity14 pointed out how social media can exacerbate problems with features such as ‘ comments ’ , ‘ shares ’ and ‘ likes ’ mr @entity14 said evidence suggests children want the material taken down quickly but it is often difficult to work with the social media companies to make this happen			1
as part of the cyberbullying crackdown , a children ’s @entity66 will be appointed to administer a two - tiered scheme for social media sites			1
tier 1 is a voluntary scheme , and if sites fail to adequately address cyberbullying issues under the voluntary scheme , under @entity78 there will be a formal legal requirement and civil penalties for a failure to comply			2
the @entity82 will also have the ability to serve notices against a person who has posted cyberbullying material targeted at an @entity24 child			1
parliamentary secretary to the minister for communications @entity14 announced the new laws during a speech on tuesday however , unlike the social media sites , that person will be referred to police instead of being fined			1
‘ the legislation will not include the power for the commissioner to fine end users who fail to respond to a notice , because we are wary of imposing fines on children			2
‘ rather , the next steps available to the commissioner , if the recipient of the notice fails to respond , will include going to court to seek an injunction ; and referring the matter to the police , ’ mr @entity14 said			0
the newly - appointed commissioner will act as the person for schools , police and parents to turn to when they do n’t know what to do about a cyberbullying incident			0
the move comes after the government commissioned a report by researchers at the @entity119 , the @entity120 , the @entity121 , the @entity122 and @entity123 and the @entity124 to understand the scale of the cyberbullying problem			0
the report highlighted how there is not currently enough legal help for those being bullied and that over a 12 month period , 20 per cent of @entity24 aged 8 - 17 have been taunted online			2
this means that in the last year in @entity24 463,000 young people have been bullied online			1
it found cyberbullying was most prominent in children aged between 10 - 15			0
meanwhile , 87 per cent of secondary schools reported at least once instance of cyberbullying in 2013 , as did just under 60 per cent of primary schools			0
the new laws will only relate to children and not adults who are being cyberbullied , mr @entity14 confirmed			2
mr @entity14 said children , parents and teachers are often ' unsure of what to do when they have been the victim of cyber-bullying ’ a spokesman for mr @entity14 explained : ' in our society , there are a range of areas where we put in place extra protections for children in recognition of the fact they are not necessarily able to make judgements or protect themselves in the same way that adults are			2
' consistent with this principle , the @entity162 ’s measures focus on greater protections for children against the threat of online bullying			1
the policy we took to the 2013 election was specifically to enhance online safety for children			0
' he added that there are no plans to introduce additional measures in relation to adult cyberbullying			1
' of course , there are existing criminal laws which apply to using the internet to menace and harass , and adults who are the victims of cyberbullying are able to use these laws , just as children are , ' he said			0
mr @entity14 said in his speech on tuesday : ' some have seen them [ the new laws ] as a threat to freedom of speech			0
freedom of speech is a vitally important value – and so we have sought to carefully limit any impact on freedom of speech with two specific design features			0
first , these measures will apply only to communications directed at children ; they have no impact on speech between adults			0

around 463,000 @entity24 children were bullied online in the last year
new laws will allow trolls who target children to be issued with warnings
if they do *n't* comply they could face charges from the @entity2
social media giants will also be issued warnings by the government
they will face fines and charges if they fail to remove bullying material
a children ’s @entity66 will be appointed to manage the drive
parliamentary secretary to the minister for communications @entity14 said the laws could be in place by the end of the year
there are no plans to introduce additional measures in relation to adult cyberbullying
