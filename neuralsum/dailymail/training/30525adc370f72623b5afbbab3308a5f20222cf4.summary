@entity0 has urged @entity1 to grant @entity2 time to deliver his @entity4 blueprint			1
the @entity5 has endured a troubled start to life in @entity9 football , with @entity11 top of the @entity12 by a single point			1
speaking as the @entity9 champions began a winter training break in @entity16 , assistant manager @entity0 called for patience and backed @entity2 to deliver an attractive , winning team			1
‘ we want to build an attacking team that scores goals and plays at a high tempo , creates chances , one - twos , phases of play , ’ he said			1
@entity2 and his @entity1 squad jetted off to @entity16 this week @entity2 hopes monday night 's win at @entity31 can reignite their title charge ‘ but it ’s not just a case of pushing a button and that ’s what happens			1
‘ there are obstacles and setbacks along the way			2
but , if we all stick to our principles , we will get there			2
’ four points adrift before monday night ’s clash with @entity31 at @entity49 , the champions reduced the deficit with a strong performance in a 2 - 0 victory			1
some have questioned the timing of @entity1 ’s decision to exercise their option to take a one - game break and spend the week in the @entity59 , but @entity0 is not concerned with the team ’s league position			1
he insists that performance is as important to the management as points			2
‘ people analyse results — and the results have n’t been great , ’ he admitted			0
@entity0 gives out instructions during training at the @entity70 in @entity16 ‘ there have been periods in games where we have created so many chances , but not taken them			1
‘ we analyse the performance			0
we need to win games to stay in the job and keep people happy			0
but we are both development coaches — not just results coaches			0
‘ if we play badly and win 3 - 0 , we look at each other and say the same thing — we are not quite happy			2
‘ we are not fulfilled and that ’s not going to change — it ’s just the way we are			0
‘ we want to see performances , we want to see the players develop			0
’ conceding that supporters will show little understanding or patience if the league title is in doubt going into the last two months of the season , @entity0 added : ‘ we are not going to change the supporters			1
@entity0 says @entity2 deserves more time to make his mark at @entity4 ‘ but we want to win and we want to win in a certain way — we do not want to win ugly			1
’ the 46 - year - old , meanwhile , has delivered a stinging putdown to @entity99 after the @entity101 analyst used an online podcast to criticise @entity0 — his boss at @entity104 between 2006 and 2007			2
@entity99 , who was one of the alleged ringleaders in an @entity107 player rebellion against the coach , claimed last week : ‘ @entity0 had a great career and was a great player — and within five minutes he ’d lost the @entity104 dressing room because of his demeanour and stature			0
’ asked to comment , @entity0 deadpanned : ‘ @entity99 who ? @entity99 wo n’t be saying anything nice about me			0
i left him out of a @entity116			0
that ’s all i ’ve got to say			0
