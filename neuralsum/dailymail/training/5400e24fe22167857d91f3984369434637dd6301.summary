by @entity0 published : 00:43 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 09:12 est , 22 january 2013 five commuters were left seriously hurt after two packed rush hour trains collided head on in @entity4 yesterday			2
a total of 41 people were injured when the two trains collided shortly before 9am in the @entity9 district in the west of the @entity12 capital			1
emergency services said yesterday that two of those injured , including one of the train drivers , were in a ' life - threatening ' condition in hospital			1
emergency services spokesman @entity42 said : ' one good thing was that the crash happened right next to an emergency services station , meaning that our people were there in seconds			2
' one of the five seriously injured passengers was trapped and had to be cut free by firefighters			2
it took almost two hours to evacuate the two trains			0
the cause of the crash was initially thought to have been a technical fault that caused both trains to be heading towards each other on the same track			0
head on : the two trains were heading towards each other on the same stretch of track in the west of the city hurt : rescuers come to the aid of one injured person , five were seriously hurt in all with two people said to be in a ' life threatening ' condition point of impact : an injured person is carried past the front of the two wrecked @entity78 trains yesterday @entity80 spokesman @entity79 said : ' one of the trains received a signal to proceed that it should n't have			1
' but a later statement issued by @entity85 , @entity12 's state railway , said early investigations showed that a supervisor neglected to trip a signal after manually activating a rail switch			1
the switch usually works automatically and sets off the signal but was stuck due to snow and ice			0
had the switch been activated , one of the trains would have been instructed to wait on a separate track until the other had gone past			0
last september a train derailed in the same area , without causing any injuries			0
an inquiry blamed human error for that incident after a rail worker switched a point the wrong way			0
wrecked : investigators assess the damage suffered by the two trains which collided in the @entity12 capital team effort : emergency service personnel worked in freezing conditions to deal with the aftermath of the crash			1

five people were left seriously injured following the @entity12 crash
