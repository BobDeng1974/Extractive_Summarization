@entity0 beat @entity1 to tighten their grip on the final @entity4 play - off place in a physical encounter at the @entity6			1
two tries in as many minutes at the beginning of the second half gave the @entity10 the confidence to see out the game			2
first @entity13 flew over and then @entity14 finished off a brilliant inter-passing move to give the @entity10 the edge			0
the hosts did not have it all their own way though as @entity1 threw everything at them but in the end the visitors did not have the power to deal with the vibrant @entity10 , who head into next week ’s @entity27 ’s @entity26 semi-final against @entity29 in great shape thanks to a 28 - 10 victory			2
clean hitting : @entity33 sends a conversion flying over as @entity0 comfortably beat @entity1 on sunday with only one point separating the two teams beforehand , it was always going to be a tense affair and that was the way the first period played out			1
the @entity10 got their noses in front after ten minutes as @entity43 latched onto a @entity14 cross-field kick to put the home side in charge			1
@entity1 winger @entity47 was left in @entity48 as the pinpoint kick caught him napping on the right flank			0
@entity51 was on hand to zoom up behind him and over for the first try of the afternoon			0
the @entity55 thought they had hit back immediately through dangerous @entity59 stand - off @entity57 but that effort was ruled out by referee @entity61 for an infringement			2
rovers were not to be denied , though , as @entity57 linked up with @entity64 to send over @entity65 for a well - worked score			2
@entity67 could not add the conversion			0
@entity69 then rampaged his way forward and his offload to @entity72 gave the @entity10 full - back some room to manoeuvre and he passed to @entity75 who sent in @entity76 for a sweeping @entity0 try			1
@entity33 was on target with the conversion to put @entity0 10 - 4 in front at half - time			1
it did not stay that way for long after the interval as @entity0 stretched their lead to 12 as @entity13 finished off a superb break from @entity87 to romp home under the posts			1
@entity33 added the extras and @entity92 ’ men were well in command			0
the @entity10 came out the traps aggressively and they were in again two minutes later as @entity76 turned the @entity55 defence inside out and his timely pass to @entity51 was enough to create the score for @entity14			0
the @entity55 put themselves back in it , however , on 50 minutes as powerful back rower @entity99 burst over to give @entity57 an easy conversion			0
the tit - for - tat scoring continued , this time it was @entity10 ’ centre @entity104 speeding over after good work from @entity14 and @entity13			1
@entity43 was unsuccessful with the touchline conversion			1
@entity51 was in action again on the opposite flank after @entity72 ’s terrific solo score			0
the @entity55 kept plugging away , with @entity111 going close , but the @entity10 held on to extend their cushion in eighth spot to three points .			0

@entity0 look set for a play - off place in the @entity4
@entity43 opened the scoring early on to set them on their way
