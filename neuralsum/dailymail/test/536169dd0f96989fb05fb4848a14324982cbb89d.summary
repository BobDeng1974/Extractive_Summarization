a sales manager who claimed he was left too disabled to work after a ' minor ' road accident ten years ago has been accused of attempting a £ 600,000 fraud - after being pictured out in a coffee shop with his celebrity friend @entity4			1
@entity6 , 55 , of @entity7 in @entity8 , was injured when a @entity9 reversed into his stationary @entity10 while he was working in @entity11 in september 2005			0
the married engineer suffered whiplash , which developed into chronic pain syndrome and a resulting deep depression , which together have ended his working life , his lawyers claim			1
but as his £ 600,000 damages claim began at the @entity19 , he was accused of a staggering fraud by motor insurers , @entity21			1
@entity6 ( pictured right ) was filmed meeting up in a coffee shop with his friend @entity4 ( pictured left )			1
@entity6 claims that a car accident in 2005 has left him in too much pain to leave his home regularly @entity28 , for @entity21 , said mr @entity6 had been put under surveillance and shown to be far from the disabled wreck he claims to be			1
he could be seen out walking , joking with a builder , striking up conversation with a stranger , crouching to fix the light on his car and as part of a gathering of friends – including disgraced pr guru @entity4 – in a coffee shop			1
' we submit that the surveillance evidence shows no sign of disability or distress whatever ; rather , it just shows a normal man of mr @entity6 's age , ' said the barrister			2
' the court can properly find that he has been and is exaggerating deliberately to an unconscionable degree			0
' the court heard mr @entity6 claims he is in so much pain , particularly in his neck , that he only rarely leaves his house			2
but the @entity54 said he had been watched by private investigators on 12 random days over three years up to 2013 and seen leaving his house on 10 of those days			2
' on the 10 days , you were out and about , walking briskly and behaving perfectly normally , ' he told mr @entity57			0
' when we see you on those 10 occasions , your neck does n't go into spasm			0
' mr @entity6 is pictured outside @entity19 where the fraud case hearing continues questioned on the difference in his demeanour on the day in the coffee shop and in court , mr @entity6 said one had been a ' good ' day and the other ' bad '			1
' i 'm not a dishonest person and i feel like it 's almost like i 'm on a murder charge , ' he told judge @entity75			0
' i feel like i need to clear my name			0
' his barrister @entity77 said the surveillance footage shown in court actually backed mr @entity6 's case			1
' it reinforces mr @entity6 's post-accident limitations , as his daily life has been reduced to a 1,350 foot radius around his home , ' he said			1
' the footage proves that he no longer participates in the maintenance and @entity90 activities that were once such a large part of his life			1
' the court heard that , before the accident and until 2009 , mr @entity6 had worked as a senior accounts manager for a tools manufacturer			2
he was a golfer and especially houseproud , keeping his home and garden in an ' immaculate ' condition , doing bricklaying , carpentry , plumbing and decorating himself			2
he and his partner of more than 30 years , @entity103 , holidayed often , visiting @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and various destinations in the @entity108			0
the accident , and its after - effects , put an end to all that , mr @entity109 told the judge			1
neck pain progressed to headaches , with blurred and double vision			0
his sleep was badly affected and he had numbness in his hands			0
a consultant psychiatrist who assessed him said his depression was most likely to have been caused by being told his chronic pain was ' likely to be incurable ' , he added			0
experts said he would probably never work again and was more likely to remain in a ' retired ' lifestyle , even at only 55 years old , he continued			0
if his claim was really fraudulent , he had managed to pull the wool over doctors ' and other specialists ' eyes for years , said the barrister			0
and , by taking such a claim to court , he was risking losing his home if it went against him , mr @entity109 added			2
however , mr @entity135 said the accident was ' not serious ' and ' low impact ' , occurring when another driver reversed into mr @entity6 's car as he sat stationary in a residential street			2
it displaced the bumper from his car , but he put it back on with the help of another and did not need to take any time off work immediately afterwards , said the @entity54			0
he said @entity21 accepted the accident was genuine and that mr @entity6 initially required attention for his injuries			1
however , the @entity54 is focusing his specific allegation of ' fraud ' on the time after 2009 , when mr @entity6 was made redundant from his job			0
mr @entity6 strongly refutes @entity21 's accusations			1

motor insurers @entity21 put him under video surveillance
he was filmed meeting his friend @entity4 and pals in coffee shop
but the claimant argues footage proves he does not go far from home
lawyer says *client* *ventures* no further than a 1,350ft radius from house
engineer tells how injuries from accident put an end to his active life
