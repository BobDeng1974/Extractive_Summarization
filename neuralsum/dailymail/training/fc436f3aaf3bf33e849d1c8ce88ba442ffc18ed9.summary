having bad sex is one thing , but writing badly about it has to be even worse for a novelist			2
some of the world 's greatest writers have produced cringeworthy stuff over the years when describing the act of lovemaking in their prose , and @entity11 writer @entity10 is the latest culprit			2
his literary mix of body circumnavigation , knicker elastic , a howling dog and a dying fairy penguin in his latest novel has now put him in line for an award that pays tribute to ' poorly written , perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description '			1
@entity11 writer @entity10 has been nominated for the @entity25 award mr @entity10 's masterpiece of love and death during the construction of the @entity30 , @entity31 , may have won the 2014 @entity32 , but it has also been short - listed for something not so well - regarded : @entity34 's @entity36 award			1
the offending passage from the book that gained his nomination describes his characters ' circumnavigation of each other ' which is then rudely interrupted by howling of a drooling dog carrying a half dead fairy penguin in its mouth			1
it 's not the most romantic of images in reality			0
written down , it does n't come across much better			0
knicker elastic , a howling dog and a dying fairy penguin are described in the sex scene in his latest novel ' whatever had held them apart , whatever had restrained their bodies before , was now gone , ' mr @entity10 writes			1
' if the earth spun it faltered , if the wind blew it waited			0
hands found flesh ; flesh , flesh			0
' he felt the improbable weight of her eyelash with his own ; he kissed the slight , rose - coloured trench that remained from her knicker elastic , running around her belly like the equator line circling the world			1
as they lost themselves in the circumnavigation of each other , there came from nearby shrill shrieks that ended in a deeper howl			0
a large dog stood at the top of the dune			2
above blood - jagged drool , its slobbery mouth clutched a twitching fairy penguin			1
' if he wins mr @entity10 will join the likes of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 established by @entity100 in 1993 , the purpose of the prize is to draw attention to poorly written , perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction , and to discourage them , and is not intended to cover pornographic or expressly erotic literature			1
but mr @entity10 is in esteemed company as the likes of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 are previous winners of the dubious award			1
he 'll be up against tough competition , however			0
@entity114 - winning author @entity113 is a front - runner for his description of a male climax			2
' he lives for seconds in that soaring agonising perfection			0
it 's this , only this , he 's lost to himself , he 's no one , he 's obliterated , there 's no @entity124 at all , there 's only â€¦ he hears himself gasp in wonder , ' writes mr @entity113 in his novel @entity128			0
mr @entity10 's masterpiece of love and death during the construction of the @entity30 , @entity31 , won the 2014 @entity32			2
now he 's in line for not so admirable an accolade not to be outdone , @entity135 gets his creative juices flowing , as well as a few others , in his best seller , @entity139 , where he compares the movement of torsos as like drawing a complex diagram in the air , and describes two young women 's pubic hair ' as wet as a rain forest ' .			0
