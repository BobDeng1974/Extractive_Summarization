at a combined cost of half a billion pounds , this trio had the most expensive starting xis over the weekend 's fixtures			1
yet @entity7 downed @entity8 on saturday with a starting side which was compiled spending an astonishingly low £ 13.6m , less than 10 times the amount of those @entity12 superpowers ( and less than @entity13 )			1
sat in second place behind leaders @entity1 , @entity7 are becoming the @entity17 of the @entity12 , stealing points from the rich clubs and keeping them for the poor			2
@entity7 are currently second in the table despite manager @entity23 's shoe - string budget @entity8 paid £ 16m for @entity13 , making him more expensive than @entity7 's starting xi @entity25 , 30 , £ 600,000 from @entity26 the @entity28 stopper is finally making the no 1 spot his own after a loan spell at @entity31 and even ending his contract in 2012 before re-signing for the club			1
@entity34 , 29m £ 3m from @entity35 ended a frustrating time at @entity35 only to land himself in a completely new one , being part of @entity23 's ' @entity40 ' when he made a group of first - team players train with the reserves , but has now been brought back into the fold			1
@entity45 , 23 , academy graduate joined @entity7 aged 13 and after going out on loan at @entity48 and @entity49 is not establishing himself in @entity7 's defence			0
@entity52 , 29 , free from @entity53 the @entity54 failed to make an impression in @entity12 at @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 but @entity23 has seen enough in the player to bring him back			2
@entity60 , 26 , £ 2million from @entity53 the left - back did not do enough on loan at @entity8 last season to earn a permanent switch , but @entity23 moved for him instead			2
@entity66 , 25 , loan from @entity0 made the latest of deadline day moves away from @entity0 after being vilified by their fans			0
he has been handed a fresh start in the @entity73			0
@entity74 , 24 , £ 2m from @entity75 one of the many players to come from @entity75 's prolific production line of young talent , he signed a four - year deal in 2012 and has flourished under @entity23			2
@entity80 , 24 , £ 6m from @entity81 was the surprise name in @entity84 's starting line - up against @entity85 and his reputation is soaring			1
started his career at @entity81 but @entity7 beat a host of top - flight clubs to his signature in 2009			0
@entity93 , 29 , free from @entity58 the controversial left - sided player jumped ship from @entity58 when they sunk back into the @entity98 last season			0
he has plenty of @entity12 pedigree , playing at @entity0 , @entity101 and @entity102 as well			0
@entity103 , 23 , academy graduate the sharp - shooting striker started his footballing education at @entity108 sides @entity109 and @entity110 , but @entity7 poached him in 2007 when he was just 16			0
@entity111 27 , academy graduate @entity7 through - and - through , having been at the club since 1994 and working his way through the academy			0
the rapid forward has won three @entity84 caps			0
total : £ 13.6m the @entity7 starting xi that beat @entity8 cost just £ 13.6m , and included three academy graduates @entity121 , £ 9m from @entity102 @entity122 , loan from @entity124 @entity125 , £ 20m from @entity126 @entity127 , £ 18m from @entity128 @entity129 , £ 12m from @entity130 @entity131 , academy graduate @entity132 , £ 25m from @entity126 @entity133 , £ 16m from @entity102 @entity134 , £ 8.5m from @entity135 @entity136 , £ 20m from @entity137 @entity13 , £ 16m from @entity138 total : £ 144.5m they are joined by the @entity140 of @entity141 , whose starting xi this weekend cost just £ 24.18m , and @entity126 , at £ 45.3m , in third and fourth , keeping ahead of the big - spending clubs with their early - season form			1
how long can they keep it up ? @entity141 's entire 25 - man @entity12 squad was built by spending just £ 52.73m , @entity126 only £ 89.2m and @entity7 £ 139.5m			1
it means that so far this season @entity141 have spent just £ 5.9m per point they 've won so far , @entity126 £ 12.7m and @entity7 £ 13.9m			0
while the richest clubs in the league shower money on world stars , these three are managing to muscle their way at the top end of the table on a comparatively frugal budget			0
@entity0 have now become the most expensively - assembled squad in the league after splashing huge sums on the likes of @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , overtaking rivals @entity2 and @entity1			1
@entity8 have over-taken @entity56 and @entity35 after their summer splurge and have gone over the £ 200m mark			1
but it is @entity7 , @entity141 and @entity126 who are keeping up with @entity1 and setting the early pace			2
