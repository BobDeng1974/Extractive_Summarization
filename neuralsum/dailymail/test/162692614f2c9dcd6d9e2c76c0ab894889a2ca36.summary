the @entity0 is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock @entity0 launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one from a store will be disappointed			1
for although the @entity0 is officially going on sale , none of its locations will have them in stock			1
instead , consumers willing to shell out between $ 549 to $ 17,000 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until june			1
usually , @entity0 launches generate long lines outside stores			1
but analysts believe the company feared the lines might be embarrassingly short and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang			1
in fact , despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are eager to adopt a new generation of wearable technology , pre-orders have far exceeded expectations			2
as a result , the company 's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today			2
analysts believe @entity0 is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year			1
the watch includes a host of personal trackers , including a heart rate monitor , and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health			0
however , @entity0 also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory , with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap			2
as a result , limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world , which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today			0
the launch of the watch into stores is being handled by @entity0 retail chief , @entity70 , who is very familiar with the world of designer labels			1
she told @entity0 staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply			1
in it she said : ' we know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers			0
' luckily , the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive			0
we know they are excited about the watch ... but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. ' last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now			0
' this was not an easy decision , and i think it 's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us , this is an entirely new category			0
' @entity0 chief executive @entity105 pictured giving a presentation on the @entity0 in @entity107 last month a spokesman said : ' our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received			2
we know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience			0
' @entity117 , technology expert and founder of website @entity119 , said : ' i think the watch will follow the same lines of success as the @entity125 did five years ago			0
it 's an intriguing device that has enough wow factor to pull people in			0
' but he added that the change in buying process this time - and the online backlog that has already begun - could put some people off			0
' the biggest problem @entity0 looks to be facing , is not if people will buy one , it 's whether they are going to be happy to wait until they can get one , ' he said			1
industry commentators believe the @entity0 will follow the same lines of success as the @entity125 ( pictured ) did five years ago			2

@entity0 launches its first smartwatch today - but its stores will not stock it
