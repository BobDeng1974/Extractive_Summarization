researchers at @entity30 calculated that the total annual cost of all cancers to the @entity14 economy is £ 15.8 billion - £ 5.6 billion of which is for healthcare costs and £ 7.6 billion is attributable to premature deaths and time off work			1
each lung cancer patient costs the @entity14 healthcare system £ 9,071 annually , the @entity17 said			1
research author , dr @entity38 , at the @entity39 , @entity30 , said : ' lung cancer costs more than any other cancer - mainly because of potential wage losses due to premature deaths from people in employment - about 60 per cent of the total economic costs - and high health care costs			1
' the death rate from the disease remains high at 56 deaths per 100,000 people in the @entity14 population annually , and almost a quarter of these occur before retirement			0
' our research shows that cancers impact the economy as a whole - and not just the health service			0
' 157,000 children aged 11 - 15 start smoking in the @entity14 each year ( posed by models ) the @entity17 said that each year in the @entity14 , 41,500 people are diagnosed with lung cancer , and eight in 10 cases are caused by smoking			1

but it ’s important to remember the very real human impact of cancer - the lives lost to , and affected by the disease			0

' putting an end to the silent salesman of the slickly - designed , colourful tobacco packaging is a crucial step towards making cigarettes less appealing to children			0
' stopping young people taking up this deadly addiction in the first place will not only reduce the number of lung cancer cases in the future but a range of other illnesses that continue to blight the lives of so many people			2
