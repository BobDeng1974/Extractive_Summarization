@entity0 has released the first official images captured by its @entity2 showing the surface of @entity4 in crystal clear detail			1
the panorama is made up of one billion pixels stitched together from nearly 900 exposures taken by cameras onboard @entity2			1
the full - circle scene surrounds the site where @entity2 collected its first scoops of dusty sand at a windblown patch called ' @entity15 , ' and extends to @entity16 on the horizon			1
' it gives a sense of place and really shows off the cameras ' capabilities , ' said @entity23 of the @entity24 at @entity0 's @entity25 , @entity26			1
' you can see the context and also zoom in to see very fine details			0
' @entity23 assembled the image using 850 frames from the telephoto camera of @entity2 's @entity34 instrument			1
he then supplemented in 21 frames from the @entity37 's wider - angle camera and 25 black - and - white frames -- mostly of the rover itself -- from the @entity41			1
the images were taken on several different @entity4 days between 5 october and 16 november 2012			0
earlier this year photographer @entity43 used the @entity2 images to assemble his own mosaic views of the planet , including at least one gigapixel scene			2
his mosaic shows illumination effects from variations in the time of day for pieces of the mosaic			1
it also shows variations in the clarity of the atmosphere due to variable dustiness during the month while the images were acquired			0
this image , taken of an area on @entity4 called @entity61 , is a scaled - down version from the 360 - degree panorama			0
nearly 900 images were taken by cameras attached to @entity0 's @entity66 and stitched together @entity0 's @entity68 project is using @entity2 and the rover 's 10 science instruments to investigate the environmental history within @entity72 , a location where the project has found that conditions were long ago favorable for microbial life			1
@entity77 , @entity78 , built and operates @entity2 's @entity37			1
@entity25 , a division of the @entity79 in @entity80 , manages the project for @entity0 's @entity82 in @entity83 and built the @entity41 and the rover			1
@entity43 also spent two weeks creating the interactive image below using 407 pictures from the narrow angle and medium angle cameras on the head of the rover , and included a bit of digital retouching			0
' [ the camera ] is only two megapixels , which by today 's standards is not huge , ' he told @entity96			0
' of course , flying these electronic components from @entity98 to @entity4 , and having them survive the radiation and other hazards , means that they were not able to just use off - the - shelf cameras			0
' @entity2 : @entity4 solar days 136 - 149 in @entity105 @entity43 added the sky and a previous picture of @entity2 to the 90,000 x 45,000 pixel panorama with @entity109			2
in march , @entity0 chiefs were relieved when a computer glitch that had stopped operations for a week was solved , meaning they could get back to examining rock powder found on the planet			2
from april 4 , radio communications between @entity98 and @entity4 will be blocked by the sun , meaning work will be halted again until may 1			0
for now , the £ 2billion six - wheel rover , which landed on the planet in august to begin its two - year mission , will continue to analyse the rock sample , which contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for life			2
@entity43 's panorama uses 407 pictures from the @entity66 's cameras scientists identified sulphur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon in the powder curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in an area known as @entity137 within @entity72			2
they believe that billions of years ago water poured down the rim of the crater and formed streams that might have been up to three feet deep			0
at the time of the discovery project scientist @entity142 said : ' we have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been there , you would have been able to drink it			0
the £ 2billion six - wheel rover , right , is analysing rock powder found on @entity4 which has been shown to contain all the necessary elements for life @entity155 , lead scientist for @entity0 's @entity156 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity83 , added : ' a fundamental question for this mission is whether @entity4 could have supported a habitable environment			1
' from what we know now , the answer is yes			0
' scientists eventually plan to drive the rover to a three - mile - high mound of what appears to be layered sediment rising from the floor of @entity72 .			0

the image is the first @entity0 - produced panoramic shot of the red planet taken by its @entity66
more than one billion pixels were stitched together from nearly 900 exposures
@entity2 's onboard camera shows details of the *landscape* along the rover 's route
@entity186 image from @entity0 shows illumination effects from variations in the time of day
