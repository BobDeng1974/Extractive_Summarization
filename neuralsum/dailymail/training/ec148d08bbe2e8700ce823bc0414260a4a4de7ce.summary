as awards season approaches , many of @entity3 's biggest names are being honored for their exemplary work in film - and a few for their drastic body transformations			2
every year seems to bring at least one example of an a-list actor who has bulked up or toned down in the name of their art , and many of these actors are rewarded for their efforts with accolades and awards			0
this year , @entity18 got rail thin for his role in @entity21 before packing on the pounds thanks to twice a day workouts to play a boxer in the upcoming @entity25 while @entity26 softened up her taut and toned physique for her role in @entity30			1
and now , both actors have been nominated for a @entity33 and @entity34 awards - and @entity36 nominations seem inevitable			0
the actor bulked up for the film 's boxing scenes , and then gained 60 pounds to portray @entity59 later in life , which at the time was the most an actor had ever gained for a role			2
his reward was a @entity36			0
gaining the weight is no doubt a breeze when compared to losing it , something @entity72 took to an extreme while filming @entity76 back in 2004			2
@entity72 lost 60 pounds by eating nothing but a can of tuna and an apple every day			1
@entity72 tends to go to extremes with his weight , losing over 60 pounds ( left ) for @entity76 , and then piling on 100 to play @entity83 ( right ) @entity72 put on even more weight to his normally svelte figure ( left ) for the film @entity86 ( right ) @entity54 would go on to add muscle ( center ) , and then 60 pounds of weight ( right ) for his role in @entity60 , a departure from his normal tiny frame ( left ) @entity96 packed on the pounds to play @entity97 ( right ) , the man who blew the whistle on the tobacco industry , then got cut to star in @entity98 ( left ) @entity99 dropped weight for his role in @entity102 by eating nothing but chicken breasts ( left ) and later gained weight for @entity106 ( right ) what 's even more astonishing is the fact that the director did not even ask @entity72 to lose the weight for the role			1
immediately after he finished filming , @entity72 then bulked up , putting on over 100 pounds to play @entity83 in @entity113			1
he would go on to drop substantial weight for the fighter and put on substantial weight for @entity86 in the years to follow			0
for this he won a @entity117 for the fighter			0
@entity119 put lots of muscle on his frame ( left ) for his role in the film @entity125 @entity126 got fit and toned for @entity127 ( left ) and then put on weight for @entity129 ( right ) @entity130 gained almost 70 pounds for @entity131 ( left ) and lost 30 for @entity48 ( right ) @entity132 was already in shape ( right ) before his role in @entity135 , but got extra bulked up ( left ) @entity130 is another performer who is not afraid to change his body for a role , gaining 67 pounds to play @entity138 , the man who killed @entity139 , in the film @entity131 , and losing 30 pounds to play @entity141 in the 2013 film @entity48			1
@entity144 's @entity143 costar @entity41 also dropped weight , and both men , like @entity72 and @entity54 , took home @entity148			2
these transformations are not just for the men either , with @entity151 packing on the pounds to play @entity152 in the film monster and @entity154 doing the same for her title role in @entity156			1
@entity154 packed on the pounds to play @entity157 ( left ) , and then shed them all and more to star as @entity159 in @entity160 ( right ) @entity151 gained weight to play a serial killer in @entity153 ( left ) and won an @entity36 for her transformation @entity164 gained weight for her film debut in @entity167 ( left ) , and then again for her role in in her shoes ( center ) @entity171 bulked up from his appearance in @entity173 ( left ) to play s tripper in @entity44 ( center ) and a wrestler in @entity177 ( right ) both women were nominated for @entity148 , but only @entity179 won			1
and it 's not just @entity26 and @entity18 who have shape - shifted this year , with @entity181 also bulking up big time for his role in @entity125			0
all three are no doubt hoping they have the same luck as @entity126 , who took home an @entity36 for his role in @entity129 , which required a 35 pound weight gain			0
less successful was @entity96 , who was nominated after gaining weight for his role in @entity191 , then again for getting toned in @entity98 , but ultimately won for the role that required no body transformation at all in a beautiful mind			0
@entity164 is one of the few actor ; 's to have gained weight on multiple occasions , first for her debut riole in @entity167 and later for the 2005 film in her shoes			1
the actor has said in recent interviews however that her days of gaining a substantial amount of weight for a role are over .			0

these @entity3 stars lost a staggering amount of weight , or did everything they could to pack on the pounds , for movie roles
some , like @entity72 and @entity18 , lost weight and then immediately gained weight going from one role to another
others like @entity154 and @entity164 have gained weight for roles on multiple occasions
