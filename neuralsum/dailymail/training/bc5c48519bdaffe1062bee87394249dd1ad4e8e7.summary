by @entity0 a fitness fanatic says he is in the best shape of his life despite eating @entity5 ’s for every meal for a month			1
@entity7 , 34 , visited the fast food chain for breakfast , lunch and dinner for a month while he followed a tough workout regime			1
mr @entity7 , from @entity13 , took up the challenge to see if he could eat burgers while getting into the best shape of his life			1
@entity7 , 34 , carried out an experiment during which he ate only @entity5 's while following a strict exercise regime for a month			1
he is pictured ( left ) before the experiment and ( right ) afterwards now , after finishing the challenge , he says he is as fit as he hoped he could become - but it ’ll be a ‘ long time ’ before he eats a burger again			2
he said : ‘ it was the hardest and loneliest month of my life , sitting alone eating my burgers			1
‘ my plan was to eat lots of @entity28 and train really hard			0
it was one of the toughest things i ’ve ever put myself through			0
‘ i was forgetting how good real food actually tastes			0
anyone can eat a burger , but to eat one for nearly every meal for a month is really hard			2
‘ food is meant to be a cultural experience , but after a while i realised i was eating for sustenance and not for the pleasure of the taste			2
‘ now i ’m finished , i do n’t think i could eat another @entity41 for a very long time			0
’ mr @entity7 previously said he was n’t a big fan of the food they serve @entity5 ’s and only went there about twice a year			1
but over the last month he visited nine different outlets where he ate 99 junk food meals , including 50 burgers , 45 crispy chicken wraps and buckets of fries			1
mr @entity7 says he gained 2.7kg in muscle mass during the month - long experiment his challenge set him back a whopping £ 366 - but he saved a further £ 55 by using vouchers			1
he took on 80,000 calories and expected to eat three kilos of fat as part of his daft diet , which he recorded on his blog			2
but his tough workout made sure that he ended up gaining 2.7kg in muscle mass during the experiment			1
after pumping iron , working a rowing machine and doing lots of running , he has lost a staggering 27 per cent of his body fat while he burnt 13,500 calories			2
mr @entity7 said : ‘ the first week was pretty tough when i started , but after a while it just became routine going in to sit down and eat my meal			1
‘ my fitness is pretty good and i was quite surprised that i reached all the fitness targets i set myself at the beginning of the month			1
‘ the hardest part was when i got the energy rush soon after eating from the calorie - rich food			2
’ he also added that he never even took his children along for a @entity82			0
mr @entity7 ate 99 junk food meals , including 50 burgers , 45 crispy chicken wraps and buckets of fries he said : ‘ i never told my kids what i was doing but eventually their mum told them			1
‘ i refused to take them with me while i was doing it , because i did n’t want them to get into any bad habits			0
‘ they had one with me at the end , but i would n’t let them come with me before that			0
’ but despite making almost a hundred visits to @entity5 ’s , the restaurant staff never even found out why he came to dine on a daily basis			1
he added : ‘ the staff at my local @entity28 did n’t learn my name			0
i think that ’s because i never told them what i was doing			0
‘ i just went in with my headphones on and ordered my meal			0
‘ i ’d imagine they ’re probably a bit confused about why one of their most regular customers has stopped coming in though			0
' he said : " i sent myself the task of eating every item on the @entity5 's menu during the month and i managed to do that			1
" in the morning i 'd usually have a breakfast roll , hash browns and a coffee , and for lunch i 'd have one of the burgers with fries and a @entity127			1
" for dinner i tended to either have a chicken wrap or salad with a small cheeseburger on the side to keep me going through the night			2
" mr @entity7 will now continue his workout regime but swap the ‘ @entity140 ’ for fresh fruit , vegetables and low fat foods in order to draw a comparison by the end of june			1
he will also be recording how much money he spends in comparison and by the end of the two months			0
following the experiment , it will be long time before he eats a burganr again , he says @entity148 dr @entity147 , who has been monitoring mr @entity7 's ' @entity150 ' challenge , said : ' i 've seen the photographs and @entity7 's six - pack does look impressive			1
it just shows you what a lot of exercise can do			2
' he 's worked hard to get the six - pack , but the workout would have been more effective if he had put decent food into his body			2
' you can get away with eating junk once in a while , but he has gone to the extreme of eating it on a daily basis			0
' one of the things he noticed was that his mood was changing and that he was starting to feel tired , lethargic and anxious			0
' it 's the wrong type of food which tends to clog up your cells and affects your brain activity			0
' another thing that was affected was his bowels , because @entity5 's food contains hardly any fibre which is crucial to cleaning your digestive system			1
' once his blood results are in , there might be other results of toxins lurking in his body			0
' @entity28 would not comment on the workout project , but a spokeswoman added : ' at @entity28 , we serve good food made from quality ingredients			0
' we offer our customers a range of menu options and provide clear nutrition information to help them make informed choices that are right for them			0
