@entity1 's crown prince has warned in a rare public statement that his country must remember @entity4 ' correctly '			1
the unusual intervention comes as politicians fight to downplay the country 's historic war crimes , which include sex slavery , torture and mass killings			0
prime minister , @entity12 , believes @entity1 should tell twentieth - century history more sympathetically			1
@entity1 's crown prince @entity14 is pictured during a state visit to @entity16 , @entity17 , on june 19 last year historians agree that up to 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by the @entity1 during @entity4 the women are thought to be predominantly from @entity22			1
in many cases , they were lured with promises of work in factories or restaurants			0
but once they were recruited , the women were forced to stay in ' comfort stations ' and work as organised prostitutes			0
research suggests that 75 per cent of ' comfort women ' died and others were left infertile or suffering from sexually transmitted diseases			0
some were beaten and killed by officers			0
prime minister @entity12 once said : ' there is no evidence to prove there was coercion , nothing to support it			1
' but @entity14 , who released the comments on his 55th birthday , said they must remember the miserable experience			1
he said : ' today when memories of war are set to fade , i reckon it is important to look back on our past with modesty and pass down correctly the miserable experience and the historic path @entity1 took from the generation who know the war to the generation who do n't			1
' it was very painful that many precious lives were lost , many people suffered and felt deep sorrow in the world including in @entity1			1
' it is important that we never forget people who died in the war ... ( and we must ) deepen our appreciation for our past so as not to repeat the horrors of war and to foster a love of peace			0
' @entity1 is thought to have killed between three and ten million people during the war , mainly @entity75			1
they also conducted the surprise @entity79 attack on a @entity81 base in 1941 , leading to the @entity82 declaring war on them			0
historians believe @entity1 soldiers also tortured prisoners of war and forced them to go through amputations without anesthesia as a form of biological testing			2
prime minister @entity12 's controversial views have already roiled relations with @entity75 and @entity22 , as well as causing unease in @entity82			1
he recently appointed a 16 - member panel to advise him on a statement he is set to make later this year to mark the 70th anniversary of @entity1 's surrender			2
@entity12 has said he will largely stand by @entity102 's previous apologies but speculation is mounting that he will seek to downplay the country 's involvement in sexual slavery			2
known as the ' comfort women ' system , mainstream historians agree that up to 200,000 women , predominantly from @entity22 , were forced into sexual slavery during @entity4			0
@entity1 soldiers point their bayonets at @entity75 civilians in @entity114 in 1937			2
some @entity1 deny that the massacre , in which up to 300,000 @entity75 were killed , ever happened @entity1 's crown prince @entity14 poses for a photo at his residence inside the @entity118 in @entity102 on february 11 right - wing @entity1 insist there is no documentary proof that the @entity1 state or its military were involved in the system and reject official guilt			1
that position angers @entity22 and @entity75 and both countries will be carefully watching any official pronouncement on the war			0
while @entity1 's newspapers remained staid in their coverage of @entity14 's comments , social media users leapt on them			1
one user , named @ @entity134 , tweeted : ' this definitely contains a warning against @entity12 , does n't it ? ' another , @ kazu_w50 , wrote : ' it is a regular recognition ( of history ) , but these comments by the crown prince stand out because prime minister @entity12 's views on the constitution and history are outrageous			1
' @entity75 - @entity1 relations have been strained since the 1937 @entity148 and what @entity75 sees as @entity1 's refusal to acknowledge the extent of what happened there			2
@entity1 soldiers murdered tens of thousands , or hundreds of thousands , of @entity75 soldiers and civilians during the @entity157			2
they were accused of raping local women and widespread looting			0
estimates of the death - toll range from 40,000 to 300,000 , but revisionists in @entity1 have contended it is much lower and even suggested that the event was entirely fabricated			0
@entity75 sees the denial to acknowledge the extent of the massacre and @entity1 's reluctance to apologise as insensitive .			0
