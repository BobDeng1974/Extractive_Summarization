will @entity0 qualify for the knockout stages ? will @entity0 qualify for the knockout stages ? now share your opinion this time @entity5 did his damage without touching the ball			1
it was a beautiful dummy , one which suckered in @entity10 and created the space for @entity12 to fire @entity13 ahead , with the crispest of drives			0
the @entity16 ( and the natives of @entity18 ) celebrated in style and without injuring anyone in the process , but there would still be work to do in a wide - open contest			1
here were two teams with reputations for strength at the back , who can be turgid , especially in the group stages of a tournament like this , producing an absolute thriller			0
the master at work : @entity36 played a key role as @entity13 kicked off their @entity39 campaign crisp strike : @entity12 fires @entity13 ahead after @entity5 's step over the round - by - round @entity42 verdict round 1 ( 0 - 15 minutes ) : the old master and his young challenger stand off each other at first , with @entity48 more concerned with attacking and @entity5 unbothered , but the @entity16 fools @entity0 ’s number 11 seconds before the end of the round with a dummy which eventually leads to nothing			1
round 2 ( 15 - 30 minutes ) : @entity5 is dictating the play for @entity13 now			1
@entity48 looks dangerous out wide but leaves his man to take over in the middle with the two fighters backing off each other for now			0
@entity61 ( 30 - 45 minutes ) : the bearded maestro almost turns @entity48 ’s cross into his own net before inspiring his team ’s best moment , dummying on the edge of the area to fool the @entity69 and allow the ball to break to @entity12 who slams home the opener			2
@entity72 4 ( 45 - 60 minutes ) : @entity5 controls the contest from range , not allowing himself to get drawn into a battle with his younger counterpart			1
@entity72 5 ( 60 - 75 minutes ) : seconds into the 60th minute and it ’s a knock - out as @entity78 throws in the towel for @entity48 and he ’s withdrawn from the contest			2
@entity13 left holes , @entity0 left more and what a delight it was for @entity5 , one of the finest midfielders of his generation with a gift for visualising the game , and unpicking it with his passing and control			1
two years on from @entity90 , a few degrees hotter with more hair on his face , he is still a delight to watch and a master play - maker			1
each touch of the ball has an effortless caress , be it a two - yard roll of the ball or the sort of 40 - yard pass he threaded behind @entity105 in the opening couple of minutes , or which he slid through on the counter-attack late on for @entity109			1
so much for the friendly handshake in the tunnel with @entity78 , the man he claimed called him @entity113 , a light - hearted term of offence in northern @entity13 , when he was manager of @entity116			0
@entity5 captained his team in the absence of @entity120 , but could @entity0 tame him ? that would be the key from the outset			1
@entity124 had worked in training to monitor his movement , with @entity127 as the @entity5 double			2
yet @entity124 did not want to leave @entity130 ’s side as they tried to shield their back - four and @entity5 was content to play from deep , particularly when he worked out @entity131 and @entity132 – @entity13 ’s dominant forces - were tormenting @entity0 ’s left side			1
in control : @entity5 keeps the ball from @entity10 taking instructions : @entity138 speaks with @entity5 and @entity139 all the threat came from the @entity16 right			1
@entity5 noted this , and manoeuvred the ball that way , sliding passes into the gaps where @entity147 had not tracked the runner or @entity105 had been dragged out of position			2
it is a sign of his understanding of the game			0
he stands where there is room and the game gravitates his way			0
it is not an accident			0
there is no - one in @entity69 football to match			0
he protects the ball never gives it away and his head is always swivelling around , looking for openings , checking out the movement around him			0
making his mark : @entity5 got around the pitch and helped @entity13 to their win there was no ' @entity174 ' chipped penalty – although @entity13 may have deserved a spot - kick when he clipped the ball past @entity177 in the first - half and the full - back blocked it with his arm			1
there was no delicious free - kick – although he went mighty close in stoppage time			0
instead , here was another 90 minutes where @entity0 never quite got a grip on him			2
it may be for the last time			0
he will retire from international football after this @entity39			0
in the meantime , enjoy him			0
and , perhaps , @entity69 midfielders can learn what he does			2
outnumbered : @entity5 keeps the ball under pressure from @entity48 and @entity177 looking for the ball : @entity5 looks for the pass as @entity13 look to get on top making his point : @entity5 gestures to the referee as @entity199 controls the ball			2

@entity16 midfielder @entity5 makes his mark in with with step over for opening goal
two years on from running the show at @entity207 - @entity208 shows he is still class
@entity0 midfielders can learn from @entity16 plays the game
