it had to be perfect			0
@entity1 played his last game of professional rugby on @entity5 soil by producing a masterclass of goal - kicking that rolled back the years and crushed @entity9 ’ dreams			1
@entity1 , the greatest points machine in @entity12 rugby history , ensured the money - men from the @entity14 defended their title with crushing efficiency that will hurt the @entity18 club every bit as much as their semi-final defeat last year by the same side			1

in truth , they were never really at the races as @entity25 ’s galacticos showed they are more than just a collection of big names on the team - sheet by crushing , squeezing and then stabbing @entity9 with two rapier thrusts either side of half - time			1
in the end they simply had too much class for a @entity9 team who obliterated @entity115 in the semi-final a fortnight ago but simply could not gain physical dominance over a @entity25 side full of world - class quality			1
last week @entity9 director of rugby @entity120 described @entity25 as being capable of playing with opponents ‘ like a cat plays with a mouse ’ and this morning he knows just how it feels to be the victim of their feline control			1
every time they attempted to attack they were smothered and thumped to the floor while every time they made an error , @entity1 was there to punish them with a flawless goal - kicking display			2
where have we heard that before ? the iconic @entity142 winner will play his final game of professional rugby next saturday when @entity25 take on @entity35 in the @entity145 final and it would be a fool who bet against him ending his career with yet another piece of silverware			2
his fast - twitch fibres may not be quite as sharp as they once were but his goal - kicking is as deadly as ever			2
@entity9 knew it , but could do nothing about it			2
‘ there ’s a lot of relief and excitement at the moment , ’ @entity1 said			0
‘ at the moment i ’m just trying to take it all in			0
everything comes from all the hard work of the team and that goes for @entity9 as well			0
i could n’t have asked for more			0
’ on point : @entity25 captain @entity1 had a 100 % success rate as he contributed 13 points in their win trademark : fly - half @entity1 's points haul against @entity9 included a customary drop goal all smiles : @entity174 ( left ) scored @entity25 's second try midway through the second - half in @entity177 the @entity18 club must now pick themselves up and somehow muster the emotional energy to beat @entity180 in next saturday ’s @entity182 final			1
they are unquestionably the best side in @entity12 and it would be cruel if they ended the season trophyless again			0
but it will be a huge ask to regroup in time to beat a @entity180 side buoyed by their @entity190 triumph over @entity191 on friday night			0
on saturday they simply could not find a way through @entity25 ’s brick wall rush defence			0
on the ball : the match at @entity177 was @entity1 's ( right ) last in the @entity5 before retiring at the end of the season master and the apprentice : @entity1 ( right ) tackles @entity74 ( left ) during their bruising encounter hard slog : @entity74 ( centre ) kicked six points for @entity9 as he struggled to get the better of @entity1 naughty boy : @entity207 ( left ) was sin binned in the first - half after pulling down @entity85 @entity210 hit : @entity75 ( left ) tries to offload a pass from the challenge of @entity213 ( right ) hoof : @entity9 scrum - half @entity80 ( centre ) clears his lines during their @entity27 defeat			1
