by @entity0 published : 01:55 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 02:02 est , 13 november 2013 president @entity2 's approval ratings have hit an all - time low as the continued problems with the health care roll out have forced him to apologize once again for his administration 's mistakes			1
a new poll by @entity10 revealed on tuesday that 54 per cent of @entity11 disapprove of president @entity2 's job performance while only 39 per cent approve			1
adding to the blow , the latest poll breaks the results down into gender and age demographics , showing that every such group disapproves of the work the president is doing			2
new lows : president @entity2 has never had a 39 per cent approval rating , making this the lowest point yet during his two terms in office male and female voters , young and old , rich and poor , all have higher disapproval ratings than approval ratings for the second term president			1
' president @entity2 's job approval rating has fallen to the level of former president @entity35 at the same period of his presidency , ' @entity32 assistant director @entity31 said in the release			1
these new figures show that his public perception continues to deteriorate as just two weeks ago he was at an earlier record low , with only 42 per cent approving in an october 30 poll			1
the latest hit coincides with the revelation that , in spite of his earlier public promises that anyone who liked their health insurance plan would not be forced to switch , about five per cent of @entity11 will not be able to retain their current health plans			2
' president @entity2 's misstatement , " if you like your health plan , you can keep it , " left a bad taste with a lot of people			0
nearly half of the voters , 46 per cent , think he knowingly deceived them , ' mr @entity31 said			0
the only issue area where voters believe the president is doing a good job is that of handling terrorism , where 52 per cent of respondents think he has done a good job with 42 per cent disapproving of his approach on global terror			0
keeping his head up : president @entity2 , seen here on tuesday with service members and vice president @entity72 ( blocked in view but sitting two seats to the left of @entity2 ) , has tried apologizing for the health care roll out to no avail the @entity10 poll offers break outs on his handling of foreign policy , immigration , the economy , health care and the federal budget - all of which came out with deficits			2
in spite of the opposition to the @entity91 , the biggest gap between disapproval and approval came from in the federal budget arena , with 62 per cent disapproving his handling of the issue and 32 per cent approving			0
the latest @entity10 poll focuses solely on president @entity2 , but when the previous @entity101 / @entity100 poll was released on october 30 he was not the only one facing plummeting numbers			0
republicans were also feeling the backlash from voters as the government shutdown was still fresh in their minds			0
the @entity108 felt the heat with an all - time - low of 22 per cent approval rating and 53 per cent disapproval .			1

numbers continue to plummet for the president as his approval rating was two points higher just two weeks ago
now every *surveyed* group of voter - male , female , old , young , rich , poor - disapproves of his job performance
change comes after he admitted that his previous statements - saying ' anyone that wants to keep their health insurance will be able to ' - were false
he now has the same approval rating as former president @entity35 at the same time in his second term
