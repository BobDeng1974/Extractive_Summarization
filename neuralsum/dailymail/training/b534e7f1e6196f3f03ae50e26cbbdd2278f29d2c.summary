a new woman has come forward with claims that @entity2 drugged and raped her - supermodel @entity3			1
in a haunting new interview , @entity3 reveals that @entity2 invited her to dinner to discuss a role on @entity7 , offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps			1
that is one of the last things she remembers of the evening			2
' i remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs			1
' @entity3 says her last memory of the night was of @entity2 taking off his robe and climbing on top of her , and that the next morning she remembers ' a lot of pain			1
' the supermodel claims the incident occurred in @entity38 , @entity39 in 1982			1
however , @entity2 's attorney , @entity40 , branded the allegation a ' complete lie			1
' she also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography , @entity47 on duty : the accidental life of the @entity51 's @entity50 , but that @entity2 and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details			1
but @entity40 also flatly rejected this claim , saying : ' you can confirm with @entity57 that she never claimed that mr @entity2 raped her , that no attorney representing @entity2 tried to kill the story ... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about @entity2 in her book			1
' in a statement , reported by @entity66 , he added : ' there is documentary proof that @entity3 is fabricating and lying about @entity2			1
' @entity2 answered the door in nothing but a white towel			1
he was fresh from the shower , too ; his black skin was glistening			0
he hugged me , a little too enthusiastically ; told me how much he 'd missed me , and how nice it was to see me			0
liquor does that to a girl			0
' @entity79 , you 're beautiful			0
' he kissed me , full on the lips , then went off to dress and we went downstairs , to dinner , where @entity2 spent the next two hours talking about himself			1
it was an evening with @entity2			1
and suddenly i remembered something @entity88 once told me			0
it was his definition of an actor			2
he said , ' an actor is a person whose eyes glaze over when the conversation is no longer about them			2
' and i thought , well , then , @entity2 is an actor 's actor			1
after dinner he asked me back to his room , and i went			0
but i stopped myself at the door			0
' i 'm exhausted , ' i said , begging off			0
his eyebrows went a little funny			0
' exhausted ? ' he asked , and it was clear he was trying hard to keep his temper in check			0
' after all i 've done for you , that 's what i get ? i 'm exhausted			0
' ' well , gee , @entity2 , ' i stammered			2
' if i had known it was going to be like this â€” ' he waved both hands in front of my face , silencing me			0
then he gave me the dirtiest , meanest look in the world , stepped into his suite , and slammed the door in my face			2
@entity3 detailed the events again of that evening in @entity38 back in 1982 @entity3 says she is coming forward now because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly , and that it is the ' right thing to do ' @entity3 did , however , detail some of her evening in @entity38 with @entity2 in the book , though telling a very different story			1
she said she was drinking with @entity2 at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired , at which point he slammed his door in her face			2
the aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story			0
she says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly , and that it is the ' right thing to do			2
' as for what she would say to @entity2 if she saw him , @entity3 does not mince words			1
' how dare you , ' she says			0
' go f * ck yourself			0
how dare you take advantage of me			0
and i hope you rot			0
' bombshell : at the time of the alleged rape , @entity3 ( pictured in the 1980s ) was one of the biggest models in the world this comes as a third women , @entity144 , came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by @entity2 in @entity145 back in 1969			1
she called him a ' very , very sick man who needs help			0
' another of @entity2 's accusers , @entity150 , told @entity151 she was just 17 when he ' brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure , and then assaulted me multiple times			2
' @entity2 , who refuses to comment on the allegations , did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior			1
his lawyer @entity159 has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated ' does not make them true			2

supermodel @entity3 is claiming in a new interview that she was drugged and raped by @entity2
@entity3 says the incident happened in @entity38 , @entity39 , in 1982 , and that the actor gave her a pill with a glass of wine , causing her to blackout
she says she woke up the next morning ' with her pajamas off , in pain , and with semen between her legs '
this comes as two other women have *recently* come forward to say they were raped and drugged by @entity2
@entity2 has yet to respond to any of these allegations
but his attorney , @entity40 , has branded the allegation a ' complete lie '
