a full 318 days after the @entity7 administration 's medical insurance overhaul website 's glitch - prone launch , taxpayers visiting healthcare.gov for critical information are instead encountering ' lorem ipsum ' – @entity10 - language filler text used by graphic designers as a placeholder when they do n't yet have meaningful information to publish			1
the nonsense words appear when users reach web pages dedicated to ' why health coverage is important , ' ' how to appeal a marketplace decision , ' ' health coverage for military veterans ' and the unemployed , and ' who 's eligible to use the marketplace			1
' in all , @entity23 found 13 mission - critical pages on the site that provided no meaningful information – just ' lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ... ' other affected areas of the site include ' reporting income and household size , ' ' health coverage for immigrants , ' what to do ' if you have @entity35 , ' 're - enrolling in the marketplace ' and ' health coverage for incarcerated people			1
' and users looking to ' @entity40 ' are met with a trio of online mini-chapters consisting only of the words : ' add bite content here			0
' nearly a year after its troubled launch , some critical pages on the healthcare.gov website still spout gibberish text the @entity52 exchange 's website seems to have caught its own case of ' lorem ipsum ' flu from the @entity56 key vote : rep. @entity58 explained to constituents why he voted for the @entity52 law by publishing a stretch of dummy text the @entity63 first reported a few of the anomalies friday morning			1
shortly after @entity23 completed its search , the @entity66 began pulling the pages down			1
now users navigating to the previously unfinished pages are met with a message : ' sorry , we ca n't find that page on @entity74			1
' we 've recently reorganized our site , and that may explain it			0
it 's also possible that you mistyped the address			2
@entity81 's robust automatic cache recorded copies of the flawed pages , but by noontime those , to , began to disappear			1
the search giant 's corporate headquarters did not respond to requests for comment			2
but a flustered official at the @entity66 , speaking on condition of anonymity , conceded that the resulting picture did n't look good			1
it 's ' something that should never have been left hanging for this long , ' said the official , who is not authorized to speak publicly			2
' [ @entity95 ] tech teams scrambled mid-morning			0
what can i say ? ' more problems : as president @entity7 golfs his way across @entity101 , he 'll be dismayed to learn that @entity102 who ca n't understand @entity10 nonsense words still are n't getting critical information from his health insurance website infected : back - end programming code includes the silly text too @entity109 : a bipartisan congressional group is communicating gibberish asked what the consequences the agency could see for for leaving @entity102 in the dark for so long about basic elements of the @entity119 's services , he said it would be handled quietly but did not classify it as a high priority			1
for centuries , typesetters and graphic designers have used @entity10 - style nonsense words like these to plan their pages long before writers have decided what to communicate			1
the beginning of the text dates back to at least 45 @entity131 , but the rest is completely meaningless : lorem ipsum dolor sit amet , consectetur adipiscing elit			2
@entity135 , secundum naturam affectum esse possit			0
quid iudicant sensus ? @entity137 salvum esse flentes sui respondissent , rogavit essentne fusi hostes			0
duo @entity138 : constructio interrete			0
quo modo autem philosophus loquitur ? @entity140 , quid est cur pulchritudinem non sequamur ? @entity141 , curiosorum			0
@entity142 enim nihil potest verius			0
@entity143 ; in his igitur partibus duabus nihil erat , quod @entity144 commutare gestiret			0
' we 'll fix it , sure			1
in our own time , ' he told @entity23			2
' we 're really focused on the back - end of the site right now , getting insurers paid and making sure collected premiums are being assigned to the correct accounts			2
' temporarily inserting ' @entity155 ' text – meaningless but standardized strings of @entity10 – into the @entity52 website appears to have been a common practice for code monkeys as well as art directors			1
one lengthy page of javascript language computer code , designed to implement the health insurance registration process , still includes at least 17 separate snippets of ' lorem ipsum			0
' some state - level @entity52 exchanges also suffer from the same problem			1
the get covered @entity170 website includes a page – full of ' lorem ipsum ' – intended to help consumers choose their insurance plans			2
@entity175 , too , has its share of lazy web coders who have left a trail of the placeholder words in their wake			1
rep. @entity58 , an @entity170 @entity182 , provides his constituents with an online explanation of the rationale behind his decision to vote in favor of the @entity119			0
its entire contents are ' lorem ipsum ' words			0
another @entity193 lawmaker , rep. @entity192 of @entity194 , has published three paragraphs of the text in place of a press release			0
staffers of @entity201 @entity193 rep. @entity200 and @entity203 @entity202 rep. @entity202 appear to have made the same error			0
the website of the @entity206 , a group founded by @entity208 @entity207 rep. @entity207 and @entity203 @entity193 rep. @entity209 , includes a 2012 press release that consists of nothing but the dummy text			1
military veterans , too , are stung by the nonsense copy on @entity74 covering their tracks : @entity56 began pulling down its dummy text - filled pages after reporters starting sniffing another plagiarized graduate thesis in @entity175 ? no , just nonsense text disguised as a press release the office of general counsel ( @entity222 ) of the @entity223 , too , features online press releases and one op - ed that are little more than ' lorem ipsum			1
the @entity222 is the office that will soon file @entity223 speaker @entity228 's landmark federal lawsuit against president @entity7 , inspired by the @entity230 's changes to the @entity52 law			1
and the @entity232 some savvy web designers have devised ways to use dummy text without leaving a trail of breadcrumbs in case the fake words remain there longer than intended			1
tricks include the use of online custom text generators which provide endless paragraphs of real - looking but nonsensical words based on limited dictionaries tailored to specific interests			2
one assembles text that reads like a page from a @entity251 movie			0
the output from another reads like the stylings of the artist formerly known as @entity256			0
there 's a text generator for hipster language like ' vinyl flexitarian pour - over farm - to - table , street art meggings slow - carb put a bird on it scenester chambray shabby chic			2
' yet another capitalizes on the popularity of pork bellies			0
' @entity271 ipsum dolor sit amet pork loin tenderloin short loin , ' was the beginning of its output on friday afternoon .			0

graphic designers use @entity10 - like nonsense text to temporarily plan pages before writers finish writing
on more than a dozen critical @entity74 pages , the dummy text has never been replaced with the real thing nearly a year after the public launch
the @entity52 exchange 's website has the same problem , as do several belonging to *members* of @entity175
@entity66 began pulling down the *faulty* web pages on friday , with one official saying ' we 'll fix it ... in our own time '
