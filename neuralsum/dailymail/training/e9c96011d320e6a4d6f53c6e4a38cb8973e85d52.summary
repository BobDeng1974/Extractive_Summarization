’ on his way to the final , especially in the latter rounds when he has lost crucial points or sets , @entity0 has been reminded of the formidable weapon that the faith of 15,000 people brings to his armoury			1
title shot : @entity0 is hoping to become the first @entity25 @entity5 champion since @entity26 in 1936 do n't choke ! this was @entity7 getting a tweak from his physio yesterday , but the world @entity30 can expect to be stretched much further by @entity0 this afternoon ‘ when i am on the court the support has been unbelievable at the end of matches , ’ he told @entity32			1
‘ that is what you need if you want to try to win these events			0
’ many neutrals were won over by @entity0 ’s tearful address to the @entity6 following his defeat by @entity44 last year			1
now he hopes to harness that heartfelt support as he faces an equally dangerous opponent in his bid to become the first @entity25 champion since @entity26 in 1936			1
‘ when you are on the court you are obviously just in the moment , ’ he said			2
‘ you know what is going on in the crowd , but there so many other people out there , loads of people obviously just queue to watch on the hill			2
it is just a shame that the stadium is n’t bigger			0
’ it will be tough conditions for both @entity0 and @entity7 out on centre court as temperatures are set to soar to @entity67 ( @entity68 ) in west @entity69			1

@entity100 , a forecaster with @entity101 , said : ' we are looking at temperatures of between @entity104 ( @entity105 ) and @entity106 ( @entity107 ) across many inland parts of @entity109 and eastern @entity110 , and we could just see @entity111 ( 86f ) likely in west @entity69			1
' yesterday was the hottest day of the year so far , and it is fairly comfortable that we are going to beat that today , with the favourite spot to do so being west @entity69 and the @entity115			0
' @entity0 will , as always , be driven from his £ 5.5 million mansion in @entity117 , @entity118 , to the @entity119 at about 10.30am by friend @entity120 in his @entity121 , oblivious to the queues as he enters at a sidegate near the practice courts			1
en route , he may well listen to his pre-match ‘ relaxing ’ playlist , which as he revealed last week features you ’re never over by @entity128 , drunk by @entity130 , @entity131 by @entity132 and @entity134 ’s @entity133			0
the 2011 champion @entity7 is likely to be listening to his favoured early @entity137 tracks when he travels in an official car with tinted windows from his rented accommodation			1
the 26 - year - old @entity141 is under no illusions about which player will be receiving the most support : ‘ it ’s normal to expect the crowd to be on his side , ’ he said			1
‘ he ’s a local hero			0
he has a big chance to win @entity5 after a long time for this nation			1
i know i ’m going to be playing against one of the biggest tennis players in the world in the last five years			0
i ’m ready for it			0
’ making history : if @entity0 , pictured left , wins today 's final , he will be the first @entity25 player to lift the men 's trophy since @entity26 , pictured right , in 1936 getting prepared : @entity0 trains with coach @entity159 at the @entity119 yesterday ahead of the men 's singles final this afternoon under pressure : @entity0 swelters in the sun during a training session yesterday - but temperatures are expected to soar even higher to @entity111 during the final this afternoon @entity0 beat @entity7 in last september ’s @entity167 final			1
@entity7 later admitted the @entity168 deserved to win			1
@entity0 declared himself better prepared mentally for today ’s final than he had been for his clash with @entity44 12 months ago			1
‘ i definitely feel calmer , ’ he said			0
‘ hopefully when i get on the court i will be a bit fresher mentally			0
‘ any tennis player wants to win @entity5 , and the closer you get to it the more you are going to think about it			2
‘ but the most important thing is that you are n’t looking ahead			0
at no stage of the match can you get too ahead of yourself – against most players that is dangerous , against someone like @entity7 that is even more dangerous			2
i am going to need to earn every point tomorrow			0
’ @entity0 's girlfriend @entity184 will be sitting in the player 's box on centre court to cheer him on , along with members of his family			1
and , despite the ' @entity191 ' , the prime minister will also be attending the match while @entity193 will fly the @entity195 @entity194 to mark the occasion			0

earlier this week , the @entity190 sent his best wishes to @entity25 's number one female player @entity216 , 19 , shortly before her fourth - round exit			1
last summer he arrived at @entity5 for the finals , where @entity0 was defeated by @entity44 , and he followed this with a series of visits to @entity223 events where @entity25 medal hopefuls lost out			1
@entity0 ’s support will , of course , spread much further afield than @entity227			2
the @entity25 tv audience is likely to be higher than the 16.9 million who tuned in for last year ’s final and is tipped to break the @entity5 all - time record of 17.3 million			1
tens of millions more will tune in from around the world			0
former @entity25 @entity235 captain @entity234 believes @entity0 ’s success in last year ’s @entity167 has set him on a roll and the @entity5 title will be the start of a succession of honours for the 26 - year - old			1
he said : ‘ i am convinced that @entity0 will be knighted at some stage in his life			2
winning @entity5 will just accelerate the honour being bestowed on him			2

the title will have that much effect			0
’ they are known as the @entity256 of the @entity6 , though neither have struck a single ball			0

’ @entity0 , 26 , is expected to land a raft of new sponsorship deals if he emerges triumphant today and stands to rake in up to £ 15 million a year			2
the boost to his finances could put him just behind @entity289 and @entity252 as one of the top earning @entity25 sports stars in history			2
the @entity168 , who won his first grand slam at the @entity167 last year , was ranked at number 32 in the @entity296 2013 with an estimated fortune of £ 32 million			0
victory against @entity7 today would land him £ 1.6 million in prize money			2
@entity300 , director of the sports marketing agency @entity301 , said the @entity25 number one could then profit from a series of lucrative new contracts			2
' if @entity0 wins at @entity5 , it means he is not a one - hit - wonder , ' mr @entity300 said			1
' with @entity44 beginning to show his age and his form perhaps fading , and @entity310 with injury worries , it could mean that @entity0 and @entity7 will be the main two for the next few years			1
' if you 're number one or two in the world of tennis , which is such a global sport , the marketing opportunities are fantastic			0
@entity0 could secure some really big deals with the biggest brands			2
' he 's reported to be earning £ 8 million or £ 9 million off court at the moment			0
we could see that edging up to £ 15 million if he wins at @entity5			2
' giving back : @entity0 spends time signing autographs for fans after a training session at the @entity119 yesterday @entity0 's battle against @entity7 is set to shatter the all - time @entity328 viewing figures record			1
last year ’s final between @entity0 and @entity44 pulled in a peak of 16.9 million viewers for @entity332			1
that fell short of the all - time record of 17.3 million when @entity335 beat @entity336 in five sets in 1980			0
but today ’s final is expected to beat that – and hundreds of thousands more fans will tune in live via the internet			0
sales of champagne are expected to reach new levels at @entity5 this year			2
