by @entity0 published : 05:29 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 20 september 2012 a tempest is brewing in @entity3 ’s hometown after a historic building at the cottage where his wife spent her childhood was turned into a snack kiosk			1
the @entity10 , responsible for the upkeep of the cottage , gutted the @entity13 i listed thatched barn earlier this year without planning permission			1
the barn in @entity19 , @entity17 was used as a pea shed in the early part of the last century until it was converted into a snack kiosk and cafe for tourists in april			1
the thatched building , pictured , is part of the @entity13 i listing but the @entity10 claim they did not realise it had the classification which required building consent @entity3 's wife : a barn on the farmhouse site , pictured , where @entity33 lived as a child was converted into a snack kiosk without proper planning permission but an investigation into the building work has revealed that the trust , who is responsible for the upkeep of the @entity3 houses in and around @entity17 in @entity43 , failed to apply for planning permission to change the use of the barn			1
the site of the cottage which includes the barn in question was where ms @entity33 lived as a child and where @entity3 courted his future bride			1
' new information ' : the barn , which was used as a pea shed in the early part of the 20th century , became a snack kiosk , pictured , in april			2
a trust spokesman said the grade i listing was ' new information ' council request : after failing to apply for planning permission , the trust has been requested by @entity64 to apply for retrospective planning permission , which if refused will mean the building , pictured with new renovations , will have to be returned to its original state part of the site : the barn , pictured , is considered inside the site of the 12 - bedroom cottage , which was built in the early 1460s , and so @entity13 i listed @entity76 , programme manager for the trust , said today that the shed was converted because they did not know it was @entity13 i listed			1
he said : ‘ we have been requested , in effect , to put things right by putting in a retrospective planning application			2
‘ the fact the pea shed was @entity13 i listed was new information			0
‘ the shed is not a @entity88 building and was probably erected sometime in the first half of the 20th century			0
‘ in april , we were confident that we would n’t need a planning application			0
’ @entity3 , right , is believed to have courted his future wife ms @entity33 , left , at the historic farmhouse but it was revealed that the trust violated planning laws when @entity64 informed them that because the shed was inside the site of the 12 - bedroom cottage which was built in the early 1460s and so part of the curtilage listing			1
this meant it was subject to the same strict planning restrictions as @entity13 i listed properties			2
the grade i classification means the building is of exceptional interest , sometimes even considered to be internationally important			0
while the grade does not mean the building can not be altered , it does require building consent within government planning guidance			2
the council ordered the trust to apply for retrospective planning permission			1
the trust has until november 5 to make a final application before the matter goes before the council ’s planning committee			2
if the council rejects the application , the trust may be forced to transform the shed back to its original condition			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ if the claimant loses their planning application the council could force them to convert the building back to its original state before the building work took place			0
’ the plans : when the trust did the planned renovations , pictured , they were ' confident ' they did not need planning permission			2
they now have until november 5 to make a final application for retrospective planning permission @entity33 lived in the farmhouse in @entity19 , @entity17 as a child and it is believed that @entity3 courted her there			1
she married him in november 1582			0
it is believed that at the time of their marriage , ms @entity33 was 26 - years - old and pregnant and @entity3 was just 18 - years - old			1
it appears that the couple conceived the child out of wedlock and so rushed to get married despite the fact that marriages were not traditionally performed at that time of the year			0
some historians speculate that the marriage was an unhappy one and that the couple were forced together by the pregnancy			0
she had two daughters and one son			0
six months after their marriage , their first daughter @entity166 was born			0
@entity167 and @entity168 followed in 1585 but @entity169 died when just 11 - years - old			0
four years later , @entity3 wrote @entity170 , a play which has been suggested to have been inspired by his grief at loosing his only son			0
it has been claimed that one of @entity3 's sonnets , number 145 , makes reference to ms @entity33 with the words ' hate away ' as a possible pun on ' @entity33 ' and another line : ' and saved my life ' , in @entity184 pronunciation , would have been indistinguishable in pronunciation from ' @entity33 saved my life '			1
ms @entity33 died in 1623 , aged 67 - years - old , and is buried next to @entity3 's grave inside @entity188 in @entity17 .			1

the @entity10 gutted a grade i listed barn on the site of @entity33 's cottage without proper planning permission
the barn was converted into a snack kiosk
ms @entity33 , @entity3 's wife , lived in the farmhouse as a child and was courted there by the *writer*
