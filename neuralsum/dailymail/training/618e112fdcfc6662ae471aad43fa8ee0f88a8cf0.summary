violent thugs are n’t criminalised by society , but may be born that way , researchers claim researchers have claimed that some people may be born with genes that makes them inherently violent			2
if true it would indicate some are simply born to be violent , rather than being criminalised by society			2
the scientists identified two genes that may be associated with extremely violent behaviour			1
one of them is a variant of cadherin 13 ( @entity17 ) , which is involved in neural connectivity , and has been linked to impulse control in extremely violent offenders			1
experts at the @entity22 in @entity23 say that the majority of violent crime is committed by a small group of anti-social , repeat offenders and set out to discover why this may be			1
previous studies have linked certain genes to violent crime , including a gene called monoamine oxidase a ( @entity34 ) that contributes to less recycling of the neurotransmitter , dopamine			1
dopamine is a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells			0
it plays a major role in reward - motivated behaviour			2
previous studies investigating @entity34 ’s connection with violence have proved inconclusive			0
professor @entity48 and colleagues at the @entity22 analysed the genes of 895 @entity52 people found guilty of criminal behaviour , organising them by the crimes they have committed			1
these ranged from non-violent offences - such as drug or property crimes - to extremely violent offences , such as homicide and battery			1
the researchers found a possible link between violent offences and @entity34 , with the strongest association in the extremely violent offending group			1
through additional research , including a genome - wide association study , they identified a gene involved in neural connectivity - a variant of cadherin 13 ( @entity17 ) - that has been linked to impulse control in extremely violent offenders			1
the researchers identified two genes that may be associated with extremely violent behaviour			1
they also suggested that low dophamine recycling associated with the @entity34 genotype , may result in higher aggression levels during intoxication ( stock image pictured ) , increasing the risk of violent behaviour ‘ when compared to the control population , non-violent offenders were not observed to exhibit either variant to a greater degree , indicating that these genetic variants may be specific to extremely violent behaviour , ’ dr @entity48 said			1
the researchers , whose findings were published in the journal @entity95 , suggest that the low dopamine recycling , which is associated with the @entity34 genotype , may result in higher aggression levels during intoxication , increasing the risk of violent behaviour			1
@entity99 neurologist dr @entity98 claims to have found the ' evil patch ' in the brain 's central lobe ( ringed ) that lurks in violent criminals last year , a @entity99 neurologist claimed to have found the area of the brain where evil lurks in killers , rapists and robbers			2
@entity112 scientist dr @entity111 said the ' evil patch ' lies in the brain 's central lobe and shows up as a dark mass on x-rays			0
he discovered it when investigating violent convicted offenders over the years for @entity99 government studies			2
' we showed these people short films and measured their brain waves , ' he said			0
' whenever there were brutal and squalid scenes the subjects showed no emotions			0
in the areas of the brain where we create compassion and sorrow , nothing happened			0
' the dark mass at the front of the brain , he says , appears in all scans of people with records for criminal violence			0
his research has led him to believe that some criminals have a ' genetic predisposition ' to violence			0
he added : ' when you look at the brain scans of hardened criminals , there are almost always severe shortcomings in the lower forehead part of the brain			0
' there are cases where someone becomes criminal as a result of a tumour or an injury in that area , and after an operation to remove the tumour , that person was completely normal again			0
' or there are physiological deficits , because certain substances such as serotonin in the forebrain are not working effectively			0
' but this is definitely the region of the brain where evil is formed and where it lurks			0
