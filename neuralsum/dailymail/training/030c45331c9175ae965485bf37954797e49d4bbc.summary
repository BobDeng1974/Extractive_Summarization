by @entity0 the historic national census is to move online to save the taxpayer almost £ 400 million , national statistics chiefs said yesterday			2
the population count , first carried out more than 200 years ago , will drop the requirement that every home and individual in the country must fill in a paper form detailing their lives			1
instead the headcount will be carried out over the internet , with paper forms available only to those unwilling to use computers or smartphones to make their return			0
the historic national census is to move online to save the taxpayer almost £ 400 million , national statistics chiefs said yesterday when the next census is run in 2021 , the @entity21 expects to hire an army of enumerators equipped with @entity25 or similar devices to help the elderly and others unsure of how to use the internet to complete their questionnaires			1
census - takers will also turn to tax and @entity34 records to try to fill in any gaps left by the online census and to try to keep population estimates up to date during the 10 - year gap between each full - scale census			1
national statistician @entity40 said yesterday that @entity41 will need to pass new legislation to allow the use of publicly - held data for the census			2
she said : ‘ i recognise that this legislation , desirable as it is for statistics and their users , requires understanding and support form an informed general public , and appropriate safeguards to protect personal privacy			0
’ the first national census was taken in 1801 , propelled by official fears of the risks of a population explosion , and the count has been repeated every decade since , except in 1941			2
questions over its future were raised after 2001 , when a poorly - organised census missed a million people , but the 2011 exercise managed to draw returns from 94 per cent of the population			2
its successes included detecting half a million eastern @entity70 immigrants who moved to @entity71 after 2004 but who had escaped the notice of other attempts to estimate the population			0
cabinet office minister @entity76 has been anxious to win savings by reforming the census			0
the 2011 census cost £ 500 million , but repeating the paper exercise in 2021 would cost an estimated £ 1 billion			0
the first national census was taken in 1801 , propelled by official fears of the risks of a population explosion , and the count has been repeated every decade since , except in 1941 @entity21 officials indicated yesterday that they believe an on - line census can be brought in for £ 625 million			1
miss @entity40 said : ‘ the general public is ready to move to a fully on - line census , as long as there is appropriate help and support for those who can not or will not go on - line			1
’ she said using administrative data alone - using information from public databases like birth and death registers , the electoral roll , @entity34 registers , school and university lists , and benefit and tax records - had a high risk of failure			1
such information is mainly used to count the population in @entity70 countries which have population registers and identity card schemes			0
the @entity21 already use child benefit statistics and birth and death registers to count population , miss @entity40 said			1
however , public records could not be used to build up a reliable picture of , for example , the ethnicity of the population			0
the on - line census and public information will be backed by a survey of four per cent of the population intended to double - check the findings			1
for those chosen , taking part in the survey will be compulsory .			0

census - takers will also turn to tax and @entity34 records to fill in any gaps left
the population count was first carried out more than 200 years ago
@entity21 officials say hey believe on - line census can be brought in for £ 625m
