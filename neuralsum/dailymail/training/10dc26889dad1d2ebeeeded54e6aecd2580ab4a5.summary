a judge has ruled that the @entity1 was correct to reject a request by a journalist asking about whether each of the @entity5 has a television licence a judge has ruled that the @entity1 should not release information about whether the @entity9 buys a tv licence because giving out this type of personal data is ' entirely unwarranted			1
' the decision was made after an almost two - year battle between @entity15 , a journalist , and the @entity1 because the corporation refused to release information to him about whether any of the @entity5 - including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 - had a television licence			1
the lengthy wrangle has seen the request referred to appeal , the information commissioner and a tribunal , which all found the @entity1 was correct to withhold the information			1
this means it will impossible to confirm if the @entity9 and other members of the @entity30 buy a television licence to watch their favourite programmes			0
however many would assume they do , as a number of their preferred shows have emerged in recent years			0
@entity37 is understood to be a favourite for the @entity39 and @entity40			0
@entity41 , who plays @entity42 in the drama , revealed prince @entity44 told him he had become a fan of the show after the @entity40 gave birth to @entity48			0
the queen is also widely rumoured to be a fan of gentle comedy @entity51			0
television aerials were also a definite fixture at the @entity55 as in 1986 one of the tower 's historic ravens was dismissed from service for eating one			0
mr @entity15 initially wrote to the @entity1 in december 2012			2
he wanted to know whether the £ 145.50 annual licence fee was paid for televisions at each of the @entity5 including @entity64 and @entity65 , as well as for @entity66			2
in the request he wrote : ' i would like to know if the @entity5 , including @entity66 , have licences for all of their televisions , and if you scrutinise and check in the same way as for residential or commercial premises			1
but the @entity1 rejected his request - made under the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) act - insisting the details were ' personal data ' and therefore exempt			1
judge @entity79 ruled determining whether tv licences are bought for the @entity5 including @entity65 ( above ) , @entity19 ( bottom left ) and @entity82 ( right ) was an ' unwarranted ' release of personal data the argument over whether the tv licence information should be released has continued for two years mr @entity15 complained and asked the @entity1 to review its decision , stating that they should have given a list of all properties - for example all the apartments in @entity93 - detailing which have licences			1
this was rejected and referred to the information commissioner , who backed the @entity1			1
the information commissioner upheld the @entity1 's decision saying there was ' a risk individuals could be identified from a full post code ' , given that there were so few residents in the specified addresses			1
' tv licence holders would have an expectation that the details about their licence held by the @entity1 would not be disclosed , ' the commissioner found , saying it was hard to see ' how disclosure would meet any specific public interest '			1
the @entity39 and @entity40 are reportedly fans of @entity37 since @entity48 was born @entity51 ( left ) is said to be a favourite of the @entity9 while the @entity39 and @entity40 watch @entity115 play @entity116 in @entity118 drama @entity37 ( right ) since becoming parents mr @entity15 argued the decision and said ' a glaringly obvious public interest matter has been , in my opinion , negligently overlooked by the @entity124 '			0
he said ' reliable sources ' had told him many staff and non-royal residents in palace accommodation do not pay for tv licences and that , if they were not being prosecuted due to their ' links to the @entity134 ' , the public should know			2
however , judge @entity135 , sitting at the tribunal with fellow panel members @entity137 and @entity139 today , said there was ' no evidence ' to substantiate the claims , which were denied by the @entity1			1
she concluded : ' even if there was a legitimate interest and disclosure was necessary , we consider that disclosure would be unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects			2
' the decision means we will not be able to get an answer to whether the @entity9 buys a tv licence the judge concluded by dismissing suggestions by mr @entity15 that the information commissioner had a ' vested interest in protecting the royal household '			1
' there is also no evidence that the commissioner has acted with anything other than impartially in this case , ' she said			0
when the @entity1 earlier asked mr @entity15 to clarify the addresses he was referring to , he also asked to know how many ' exemption requests ' the corporation had received for these premises in the past two years			2
he wanted to know : ' are you pro-actively making , and then following up on licensing requests to these premises and how many requests were made in the last two years to how many ' properties ' within the palaces / government residences ? ' the @entity1 replied , clarifying that it was its ' duty to ensure that everyone in the @entity181 who needs a licence has one ' and stating that there had been no requests for exemptions from the specified addresses			2
almost 200,000 people are prosecuted a year – one in nine of all lower court cases - and more than 50 people were sent to prison in 2012 - 2013 for failing to buy a tv licence			0
@entity192 last year released some of the worst excuses for failing to pay			0
these included one person who said : ' apparently my dog , which is a corgi , is related to the @entity9 's dog so i did n't think i needed a tv licence			0
another person said they thought they could avoid the charge because they spent a lot of time watching television at a neighbour 's house .			0

@entity1 rejected request by journalist about tv licences at the @entity5
this was upheld after a review and by the information commissioner
now a tribunal judge says @entity1 was right to refuse to release information
judge @entity135 said release of this personal data was ' unwarranted '
