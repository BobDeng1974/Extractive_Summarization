@entity1 's last close encounter with an @entity3 international ended with @entity4 advising him to try @entity5 instead , so the @entity7 boss will feel there is room for improvement			1
@entity1 joined @entity11 on loan from @entity13 in november 1996 , with a plan to spend four months in @entity15 playing in the second tier of @entity18 football but he played only once , in a 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity20 , when he was replaced after an hour			1
@entity7 boss @entity1 played one game for @entity11 in 1996 one moment stands out in his memory			1
‘ i was playing in midfield with @entity4 , who was a bit older then but still a terrific player , ’ said the 38 - year - old @entity25			2
‘ when we got this dangerous free - kick situation i was confident enough to tell him i should take it and he said : “ go on then son ”			0
i kicked it 10 metres over and he did this field - goal sign , and was laughing when he said that i should try @entity5			0
’ he was too polite to mention @entity4 ’s penalty in @entity40 , also launched into the sky			2
@entity1 , who previously managed @entity42 and @entity13 , took control of @entity7 at the end of last year and his first campaign started with an encouraging win at home to @entity48			2
@entity1 ( right ) signs for @entity11 boss @entity50 but that upbeat mood was punctured by defeat in @entity53 on thursday with @entity54 sent off and therefore suspended on sunday			1
‘ @entity55 was not what @entity56 expected or hoped for but they are at start of something new with young players with key roles , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ it ’s now a team with more pace			0
we have to be a compact unit and put out a perfect performance and then there is a chance			0
