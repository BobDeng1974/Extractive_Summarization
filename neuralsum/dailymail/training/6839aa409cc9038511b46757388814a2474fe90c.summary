a @entity2 students ' union has been forced to apologise after using a @entity4 victory symbol to advertise a @entity6 - themed drinking event			1
dozens of students at @entity2 complained after spotting the resemblance between the double lightning bolt on the @entity12 advert and the @entity13 used by @entity15 's bodyguard			1
university chiefs insisted the logo was accidentally used to separate @entity19 and @entity20 text on the poster for the sold - out night and removed it from the @entity24 event			1
@entity2 has been forced to apologise after using a @entity4 victory symbol to advertise a @entity6 - themed drinking event but students branded the organisers ' insensitive and inappropriate ' for using a poster which glorified the brutal fighting force responsible for the @entity30 and other crimes against humanity			1
final year student @entity34 said : ' i think it 's highly insensitive , inappropriate and really stupid			2
who thought that was a good idea ? ' @entity40 said : ' although undoubtedly an innocent mishap , an organisation which claims to be a professional establishment should not be making sloppy mistakes like that			0
' i 'm sure nobody was offended but they need to be more careful			0
' the @entity48 ( pictured in a 1940 recruitment poster for the @entity50 , a wing of the @entity52 ) was a common symbol on @entity4 uniforms and on @entity4 flags the event , which is due to take place next friday , will feature a performance from oompah and lederhosen band @entity60			1
not all students recognised the doublie lightning bolt as @entity4 insignia			1
@entity64 , a @entity65 student , said : ' the first time i saw it i just assumed it was lightening bolts to be honest , i did n't make a connection			0
' @entity71 added : ' i feel a bit bad i did n't recognise it as insignia			0
i should have paid more attention in history			0
' the @entity4 , or @entity4 , expanded from a small paramilitary unit to a powerful force that served as @entity15 's bodyguard , the @entity52 's ' @entity80 ' and a force fielding almost a million men			2
@entity83 ( left ) was appointed head of the @entity4 in 1929 and was influential in @entity85 , a soldier ( right ) with a helmet bearing the @entity48 symbol they were chosen to implement the ' @entity90 ' and led the killing , torture and enslavement of more than 12 million people			2
@entity83 was appointed head of the @entity4 in 1929 and persuaded @entity15 to run the fighting force as a separate organisation an @entity98 spokesman said : ' we very much regret that this symbol appeared on a social media posting and can assure you that it was a genuine mistake that was simply used to separate the @entity19 and @entity20 text , and was removed as soon as it came to our attention			1
' this has not appeared on any of the official promotional material			0
we apologise for any offence caused			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 insisted the logo was accidentally used to separate @entity19 and @entity20 text on the poster the @entity4 used runic insignia on flags , uniforms and posters to promote @entity4 ideology			1
they also represented virtues seen as desirable in @entity4 members , and were based on v√∂lkisch mystic @entity122 's @entity121 runes , loosely based on the historical runic alphabets			0
the @entity48 , which looked like a lightning bolt , symbolised victory for the elite fighting force			2
it was adapted into the emblem of the @entity4 in 1933 by @entity129 , a @entity4 soldier			0
@entity129 's simple but striking device consisted of two sig runes drawn side by side like lightning bolts , and was soon adopted by all branches of the @entity4 as well as standing for the initials of the @entity4 , it could be read as a rallying cry of ' @entity139 , @entity139 ! ' .			2
