the mother of a high school student who has been prevented from attending classes as a consequence for not wearing the right style shoes has expressed her outrage over the ' ridiculous ' situation			1
@entity7 , 14 , turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at @entity11 , in @entity12 's south - east , only to be told that the black soft - leather lace - ups did not meet uniform standards			1
the @entity16 student was prevented from attending her classes for the day , and has not been allowed back into the classroom since the incident , which her mother @entity20 claims has disadvantaged and excluded her daughter			1
@entity7 , 14 , has been prevented from attending classes at her @entity12 high school because her shoes do not meet the strict uniform guidelines the secondary school 's policy outlined in the 2015 @entity29 states that girls are to wear ' black leather lace - up school shoes ( not fashion heels ) ' for both summer and winter uniforms , a guideline which ms @entity20 said @entity7 's shoes meet			1
ms @entity20 said that after going through five pairs of shoes in four school terms , she decided that her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs			2
' rain , hail , or shine @entity7 has to walk to catch the bus , and then switch to another bus to get to school because of my work , and so we decided to look into a different type of shoe than the ones we had been buying , ' ms @entity20 told @entity52			2
' is it that big a deal that my daughter has shoes they do n't care for ? kids walk and skate , and catch a bus or a train , not every child gets driven to school			2
the rules need to cater for comfortable and practical shoes , ' she said			2
the rubber - soled soft leather lace - ups were pointed out by a teacher on the first day of term , and @entity7 was taken to the school 's office , where she was offered a pair of shoes from lost property , and remained until the end of the day			1
ms @entity20 was not contacted to let her know that her daughter had been taken out of class , and said that she has had no contact with the principal of the school , @entity78 , despite mr @entity78 issuing a statement on thursday reinforcing the uniform guidelines			0
the secondary school 's policy states that girls are to wear ' black leather lace - up school shoes ( not fashion heels ) ' , which ms @entity20 said the shoes comply to ms @entity20 said her daughter needed a more practical and comfortable shoe to meet her needs ' i just ca n't make sense of this			1
they 've shifted the goal posts on what they are expecting of the uniform			0
when i spoke to the vice-principal yesterday i was told that her shoes are n't the type of shoes they 're looking for , even though they are black leather lace - ups , ' she said			1
ms @entity20 was informed that the school was looking for shoes with more of a heel , but has been left baffled as to why her daughter is being punished for a non-existent rule			0
' why has she not been allowed to attend class while this grey area is being cleared up ? if i decided to pull her out of school for four days , i would be in trouble			1
but for some reason they can pull my daughter out of classes simply because they do n't like her shoes '			0
the 14 - year - old has not been allowed back into classes since monday , which ms @entity20 said has caused significant issues when it comes to her daughter completing her school work			1
' the school said that she has n't been given an in - school suspension , but i do n't know how else to look at it			2
she ca n't go to class			0
what is that if not a suspension ? ' ms @entity20 said			0
' she has been allowed to approach each of her teachers at the beginning of the lesson to ask for work , and some have given her work , but some have n't , ' she said			0
' it 's the start term and so she is really struggling to complete work because she 's not in class to have things explained to her			0
' ms @entity20 also said that she pointed out to the school that being unable to attend classes and prevented from joining in with her classmates was exclusion , which went against the school 's own policy			1
the school offered to buy @entity7 a pair of shoes which met the standards of the uniform policy , but ms @entity20 said that she had declined the offer as she did not understand why her daughter was not able to wear comfortable shoes that she already owned			1
ms @entity20 said that her daughter was being excluded from classes , which breached @entity11 's own policy on bullying and harassment @entity11 's principal @entity78 said that the school was sticking by the uniform policy mr @entity78 released a statement on thursday addressing the issue			1
' our students are expected to wear black leather lace - up shoes			1
shoes with a flat sole — ‘ skate - style shoes ’ — are not acceptable , ' mr @entity78 said			0
' we have done everything to assist the family concerned , including offering the student a pair of appropriate shoes , ' he said			0
' we still expect the student to wear the appropriate shoes but will be ensuring she receives regular classroom teaching , which is what we have always wanted , ' reported @entity179 mr @entity78 said that @entity11 's uniform policy was set by the school council , and involved consultation with the school community			1
ms @entity20 said that she was disappointed and frustrated with the school , and could n't understand why her daughter 's shoes were drawing so much attention when the school had much larger issues			2
' i had another parent say to me that she could n't believe they were worried about school shoes when there are students walking around the local shops in school hours , ' she said			2
' other parents have thanked me for sticking up for the kids and not letting the issue be swept under the carpet			0
' ' it seems trivial and sad when we look at what 's going on in society and with kids these days			0
i just find it ridiculous '			0
ms @entity20 has contacted her local mp , and has also submitted a complaint with the @entity210 , and hopes to get a response within the next two days			0
@entity11 has been contacted for comment .			0
