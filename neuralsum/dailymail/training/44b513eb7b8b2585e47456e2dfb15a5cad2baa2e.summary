last month he said that an ' @entity2 first ' attack was the best means to combat @entity3 , but @entity4 has reportedly developed a new strategy to defeat the @entity7 splinter group - starting with the removal of @entity10 president @entity9			1
senior @entity12 officials have told @entity13 that the national security team has met four times , including one meeting chaired by @entity4 , to orchestrate the new strategy			1
the @entity17 and many of its allies see president @entity9 as the reason @entity3 have been able to gain strength in @entity10			2
@entity4 's initial approach was to fight @entity3 on the ground in @entity2 while the government put together their own rebel force that could go after the group			1
' the long running @entity10 problem is now compounded by the reality that to genuinely defeat ( @entity3 ) , we need not only a defeat in @entity2 but a defeat in @entity10 , ' the senior sources told @entity13			1
' developments on the ground have caused the national security team to collectively conclude we may not have time for @entity2 first			1
' in an ideal world you would drive ( @entity3 ) out of @entity2 and pivot to @entity10			2
' but if by then the moderate opposition has been smacked and ( @entity3 ) is still there , that does n’t help			0
' embarrassingly , @entity49 spokesman rear admiral @entity48 told @entity13 that the @entity17 have not yet started preparing their @entity10 opposition fighters , despite announcing the plan four months ago			2
the plan asked @entity52 for $ 500 million to train and equip the 5,000 vetted rebels over the space of one year - but nothing has been done			1
' the vetting has n't started , ' @entity56 said			0
threats : @entity3 have released videos showing the deaths of captives such as @entity62 , pictured above			0
they have been exclusively from the @entity63 and the @entity17 - whose governments do not pay ransoms ' once it does start , that will be about a three - to - five - month process and then it ’s about 8 - 9 months of training after that			0
' ' so we still got a ways to go			0
' the @entity75 reports that @entity4 's turnaround comes after defense secretary @entity77 sent a private memo to @entity79 detailing his reservations about the president 's handle on @entity10 and @entity2			2
secretary of state @entity83 and other officials have also questioned the plan			0
@entity3 hopes to to create an @entity87 state across @entity89 areas of and are known for public execution - style killings .			0

@entity12 developed a strategy to attack @entity3 on the ground in @entity2
announced a $ 500 million plan four months ago to train a rebel force that could go after the group
plan was *largely* criticized as being *unrealistic*
@entity13 now *quoting* senior government sources saying @entity4 has been forced to turnaround his plan
national security team believe removing @entity10 president @entity9 will kick - start the defeat of @entity3
