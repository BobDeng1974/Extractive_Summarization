by @entity0 upheld : @entity2 's parliament passed a burka ban in 2010 , leading to protests from @entity6 groups who said it was discriminatory			1
( @entity9 picture ) an attempt by a @entity13 legal team to reverse @entity2 's burka ban was today rejected by the @entity15			1
in a test case which will have widespread implications in other countries , judges said that the measure aimed at stopping women covering their faces in public was entirely justified			2
they said that the right of ordinary people to ' live together ' was a ' legitimate objective ' , and that @entity28 women wearing face coverings threatened it			2
@entity2 's parliament passed a burka ban in 2010 , leading to protests from @entity6 groups who said it was discriminatory			1
today lawyers for an anonymous 24 - year - old university graduate told the @entity37 - based court that the ban was ' degrading ' and a ' breach of religious freedom '			2
the complainant , identified only by her initials @entity42 , is a @entity2 citizen but has family in @entity44			0
her @entity13 lawyer @entity45 told the court at an earlier hearing that she is a ' perfect @entity2 citizen with a university education			0
she speaks of her country with passion			0
she is a patriot ' @entity42 in turn said in a written statement that being forced to take off her veil in public constituted ' degrading treatment '			0
the law , which came into force in 2011 , means women who wear full - face veils in public can be fined around Â£ 130			0
there have been arrests and convictions in @entity2 , but attempts to enforce the ban have also sparked disturbances , including a riot in the @entity69 suburb of @entity70 last year			1
an appeals court in @entity72 , near @entity69 , is today considering the case of a man who attacked police when they stopped his veiled wife , and he ended up with a three month suspended prison sentence			0
@entity2 has the biggest @entity28 population in western @entity79 , and many believe that society has an agenda against them			1
this belief was reinforced last month when the far - right @entity84 , a party which has numerous policies aimed at stopping the spread of @entity6 culture , made huge gains in @entity79 elections			0
ruling : judges at the @entity15 said that the right of ordinary people to ' live together ' was a ' legitimate objective ' , and that @entity28 women wearing face coverings threatened it @entity96 and parts of @entity98 have also introduced bans , and similar ones are being considered in @entity101 and @entity102			1
plans for one in @entity13 have also been mooted by backbench mps and other politicians , including members of the @entity13 @entity107			0
today 's @entity79 ruling is likely to increase calls for the burka ban to be adopted by other countries .			1

@entity28 groups protested after @entity2 passed its ban on the veil in 2010
but @entity15 today ruled it is entirely justified
ruling likely to *encourage* other countries to adopt burka bans
