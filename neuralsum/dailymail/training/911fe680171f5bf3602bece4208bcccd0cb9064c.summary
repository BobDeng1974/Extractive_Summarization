dozens of @entity2 trolls are sending bomb threats to @entity4 , just days after a @entity6 teenager was arrested for the same prank			1
' prank ' messages are being tweeted to the airline , threatening specific flights or just claiming that bombs are set to go off on a certain date or time			1
a user calling himself @entity15 tweeted : ' @entity17 the bomb goes of in 3 hours			1
' while another user , known as @entity30 , wrote : ' @ americanair you really seem to not care that i ’m about to bomb your plane that ’s headed to @entity33			1
btw , my name is @entity35			2
' prank : @entity2 users have not taken heed of what happened to @entity6 teenager @entity40 , who threatened @entity4 the theme of the tweets was to threaten to be a member of @entity44 , much as the @entity6 teenager did with her prank from the @entity2 account @ @entity48 _			1
one called @entity49 tweeted : ' @entity50 i 'm going to throw a massive bomb at june 3th any airplane going to @entity54			1
' and a user called @entity56 wrote : ' in two days a bomb is going to explode in one of your planes			1
' however , he seemed to back out of his prank with a follow - up message reading : ' @ americanair it 's @entity65 do n't panic ! hahaha ' bad idea : the teen immediately regretted sending this ' joke ' bomb threat the flood of messages comes after a 14 - year - old @entity6 girl - named @entity40 - was arrested in @entity73 after tweeting a threat to @entity4 and claiming to be an @entity44 operative			1
@entity76 , a spokesman for @entity73 police , told @entity78 that officers in the city had launched an investigation into the tweet after it was reported around the world			2
but before detectives could track the girl down , she walked into a police station accompanied by a family member			0
mr @entity76 said : ' police spoke to prosecutors to decide whether we could arrest her and , after some deliberation , we decided that we could arrest her and she has been arrested			0
' she is now being interviewed by specially - trained officers who are used to speaking to young offenders			0
' mr @entity76 said the girl has not been charged with any offence , but could face charges related to ' making false threats '			0
it was just a joke : the girl insisted she was joking and not from @entity99 , but the airline did not reply worried : the girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus , anything to avoid being in trouble the teenager sent : ' hello my name ’s @entity107 and i ’m from @entity99			2
i ’m part of @entity44 and on june 1st i ’m gon na do something really big bye			0
' however her prank went wrong when @entity4 replied , stating : ' @entity40 , we take these threats very seriously			1
your ip address and details will be forwarded to security and the @entity121			0
' the young girl 's subsequent public meltdown on @entity2 , in which she explained that she was joking and begged the airline to reconsider , went viral until her account was suspended. , but not before her followers increased to more than 30,000			2
the teenager wrote in response : ' i always wanted to be famous			2
but i meant like @entity134 famous , not osama bin laden famous			0
' both the @entity4 and @entity40 ’s tweet were eventually deleted , and it is not exactly clear if any call to the @entity121 was ever made			1
‘ we took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic , ’ spokeswoman @entity139 told the @entity140			0
‘ we took it down so we could better focus on our customers			0
’ @entity2 spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the @entity148 , but tweeted that ‘ only law enforcement can request private information about @entity2 accounts			0
’ @entity40 expressed remorse for the stunt , wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘ i changed my name to @entity107			0

dozens of users have threatened bomb attacks on @entity4 flights following the @entity6 teenager 's prank
most have since taken comments down following abuse from other users , while others have left theirs on the *social* media site
it is not clear if authorities will get involved in each case , but airlines have *confirmed* they have to investigate every threat made against them
