@entity1 is building the world 's first hack - proof computer network in a bid to give it the edge in its cyberwar against the @entity7 , it has been reported			1
a £ 60million fibre - optic cable between @entity9 and @entity10 is being developed that will secure government , financial and military information from eavesdroppers			1
the network will be up and running in two years time and will transmit quantum encryption keys to keep information safe			1
@entity1 is said to be building the world 's first hack - proof computer network , top stop eavesdroppers it has been reported ( file picture ) it is being funded by the central government and at first will be used for money transfers by @entity26 , the world 's largest bank			1
the project is being led by professor @entity29 , a quantum physicist at the @entity30 of @entity1 ( @entity31 )			1
he told the @entity32 : ' we learnt after the @entity35 affair that we are always being hacked			0
' since most of the products we buy come from foreign companies , we wanted to accelerate our own programme			0
this is very urgent because classical encryption was not invented in @entity1 , so we want to develop our own technology			1
' @entity42 ( @entity42 ) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light			0
if the line tries to be tapped into , it will disturb the encoding and will be detected , providing security			0
the news comes after a a representative study on internet attack traffic has revealed that @entity1 is the country where the largest number of attacks originate			1
by monitoring connections on the web it was shown that 43 per cent of online attacks originated in @entity1 , more than three times @entity59 in second place with 15 per cent			2
@entity42 ( @entity42 ) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light ( file picture ) and the researchers add that general internet users can keep themselves safe by frequently updating their software			0
the attacks in the study refer to attempts by a computer to connect to specific ports on the internet , which would indicate a hacked or infected computer that was trying to connect to other computers			0
@entity76 ’s @entity75 , editor of the report , explains to @entity78 that the results should not be taken as a view of the internet as a whole , but rather only as representative findings			0
‘ we ’re basically saying from the systems we ’ve got out there , 43 per cent of the attacks we observe are coming from @entity1 , ’ he says			2
when asked if he ’d expect similar results if every connection on the internet was monitored , he says : ‘ it ’s hard to say if they ’d be similar			0
' other attack traffic studies have placed @entity1 in top spot [ like @entity76 ] , others have placed other countries top			2
