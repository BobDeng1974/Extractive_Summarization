@entity0 has revealed it will develop an array of new weapons - including nuclear warheads - amid the escalating stand - off with the @entity5 over its involvement in @entity7			1
president @entity8 revealed the move after @entity10 set up a ' spearhead ' force to defend eastern @entity12 against what it describes as growing evidence of a @entity0 presence in @entity7			1
he told a @entity17 meeting western nations should not get ' hysterical ' about the re-arming , insisting the prospect of @entity0 entering a @entity22 style arms race was ' absolutely excluded '			1
in the speech - made on the same day @entity0 's military successfully test - fired an intercontinental ballistic missile from a nuclear submarine - he said : ' we have warned many times that we would have to take corresponding countermeasures to ensure our security			1
' i would like to underline that we only take retaliatory steps			2
' the statement appeared to signal that the @entity0 leader is determined to pursue a tough course in the face of more @entity56 sanctions over the @entity7 crisis			2
relations between @entity0 and the @entity5 have plummeted to their lowest point since the @entity22 after eastern @entity7 , where many people are ethnically @entity0 , was overrun by @entity29 rebels			1
conflict : a pro-russian fighter beside a burnt - out @entity7 military truck today in @entity64 , @entity7 toll : a boy beside a damaged wall in @entity64			2
the conflict has raged for five months and killed 3,000 people there have been repeated claims - denied by @entity8 - that @entity0 is encouraging the unrest in order to allow an invasion in the guise of a humanitarian mission			1
the @entity77 is mulling a new wave of sanctions against @entity0 , intended to persuade it to honour its part of a cease - fire agreement signed last week			2
@entity26 denies sending troops into eastern @entity7 , but leaders in the capital @entity86 and @entity56 backers say there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary			2
at one point @entity10 estimated there were 1,000 @entity0 troops on @entity7 soil			1
today @entity7 's president said @entity0 had removed ' 70 per cent ' of its forces from his country , raising hopes for peace after a five - month conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people			1
president @entity101 said parts of the east under rebel control would get special status under a peace deal			0
presidential duties : @entity8 also cast his vote today in the @entity110 elections , pictured standing guard : @entity7 forces ( pictured ) have been battling @entity29 rebels in the east for months ' according to the latest information i have received from our intelligence , 70 percent of @entity0 troops have been moved back across the border , ' he said			1
' this further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects			0
' he added 700 @entity7 prisoners had been freed from rebel captivity and expressed hope that another 500 would be freed by the end of the week			0
but he said the ceasefire was not easy to maintain because ' terrorists ' were constantly trying to provoke @entity86 's forces			0
in today 's speech , which addressed @entity0 's weapons modernisation programme from 2016 to 2025 , @entity8 said the military had to replace @entity138 weapons approaching the end of their useful lifespan			1
he said the country should focus on building a new array of offensive weapons to provide a ' guaranteed nuclear deterrent '			0
the plans also involve re-arming strategic and long - range aviation ; creating an aerospace defence system and developing high - precision non-nuclear weapons			0
in charge : pro-russian rebels smoking as they guard @entity31 airport , which was overrun earlier this year refugees : a displaced family from @entity31 today on the outskirts of the southern coastal town @entity156 he would not elaborate on the type of weapons , but he and other officials have repeatedly boasted about new @entity0 nuclear missiles ' capability to penetrate any prospective missile shield			2
the @entity17 's current modernisation programme , to 2020 , is already costing Â£ 330billion			0
@entity0 inherited most of its arsenal from the @entity138 and has struggled to develop new weapons systems after the @entity167 industrial meltdown			0
the difficulties faced by the @entity0 arms industry have been highlighted by the long and painful development of the @entity172 intercontinental ballistic missile , which suffered repeated launch failures			0
but its designers finally seem to have cured the glitches , and the navy boasted of a successful launch of the @entity172 from a nuclear submarine today			0
talking about potential threats , the @entity0 president specifically pointed at the @entity37 missile defense program and @entity183 's plans to develop new conventional weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world in as little as an hour with deadly precision .			0
