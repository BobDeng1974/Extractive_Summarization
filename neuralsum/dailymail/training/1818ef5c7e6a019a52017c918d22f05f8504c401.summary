the machines were spotted working by the side of a runway at @entity13 , with tents erected nearby			0
the 21 - strong team of archaeologists , led by @entity18 farmer @entity17 , is searching for rare @entity20 xiv spitfires that were believed to have been buried in crates in august 1945			1

@entity43 built a total of about 20,000 spitfires , although the dawn of the jet age meant the propeller - driven planes quickly became obsolete			1
as many as @entity45 - three to four times the number of airworthy models known to exist - are believed to have been buried in near - pristine condition in @entity5 by @entity54 engineers as the war drew to a close			0
the single - seater @entity57 , which helped @entity43 beat back waves of @entity61 bombers during the war more than six decades ago , remains the most famous @entity43 combat aircraft			1
hope : the spitfires are believed to have been buried as a way of disposal when the war came to an end blessing : mr @entity17 speaks with a @entity70 monk who was brought to bless the site before digging began technology : mr @entity17 ( left ) looks at ground scans with two of his team of @entity43 archeologists			1
the group are using sophisticated techniques to try to locate the @entity9 site : the @entity5 government has given mr @entity17 's team permission to dig for the planes at @entity13 ( @entity83 ) @entity13 the wooden crate located in northern @entity5 was found in @entity85 in @entity86 during a dig that began last month			1
mr @entity17 said the search team in @entity86 inserted a camera into the crate and found it was full of water			1

publicity : a journalist takes photos of research materials related to buried @entity43 spitfires which are thought to be buried in the @entity5 jungle lost : one of the @entity9 ( pictured : the tail fins ) being crated up in @entity5 in 1945 ready to be buried valued : the team hopes to be able to uncover the @entity110 in a good enough state so that they can be reassembled upon their return to @entity43 ( file photo ) under the deal , @entity5 's government will get one plane for display at a museum , as well as half of the remaining total			1
@entity120 , a private company headed by mr @entity17 , will get 30 percent of the total and the @entity5 partner company @entity123 , headed by @entity124 , will get 20 percent			2
during the project 's first phase , searchers hope to recover 60 planes : 36 planes in @entity129 , near @entity13 's international airport ; six in @entity131 in central @entity5 ; and 18 in @entity85			0
others are to be recovered in a second phase			0
critics have said it 's possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty aircraft parts			0
but the search team say the @entity9 are believed to be in good condition because they were waxed , wrapped in greased paper and had their joints tarred by @entity144 crews			0
mr @entity17 , 62 , from @entity145 , started his treasure hunt in 1996 after hearing a throwaway remark from a group of @entity54 veterans who said they once buried spitfires in @entity5			1
he tracked down an eyewitness who led him to the area where the aircraft were buried			2
he eventually located the buried planes using ground - penetrating radar equipment			0
his team dug a borehole and sent down a camera to look at the crates , which were said to be in ‘ really good condition ’			0
mr @entity17 said the practice of burying aircraft , tanks and jeeps was common after the war			2
' basically nobody had got any orders to take these airplanes back to ( the ) @entity43			2
they were just surplus ... ( and ) one way of disposing them was to bury them , ' mr @entity17 said			0
' the war was over , everybody wanted to go home , nobody wanted anything , so you just buried it and went home			0
' @entity182 , a 91 - year - old war veteran from @entity43 who says he witnessed the aircraft 's burial , traveled to @entity5 to observe the search			1
