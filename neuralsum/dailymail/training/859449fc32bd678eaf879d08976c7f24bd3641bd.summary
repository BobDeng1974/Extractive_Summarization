@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for @entity4			1
the @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			2
the big question – @entity11 : in or out ? i reckon @entity13 will pick @entity11 and play him in a role behind @entity15			1
i think he ’ll do a similar thing to sir @entity17 and play @entity11 off the front and against @entity19 tell him to watch @entity20			1
leader : @entity13 is likely to select @entity11 ( above ) behind @entity15 he is @entity19 ’s pass master , their catalyst , who wants to dictate and control the game			1
in the old days when the cavalries would ride into battle they used to target the general at the back , sitting on his white horse			2
as soon as you got to him the attackers knew the rest of the soldiers would scarper without their leader			2
@entity20 is the general on that horse but the @entity40 are not renowned through history for being great battlers			1
if @entity11 and @entity44 can stop @entity20 , then i do n’t think this @entity40 team will be up for the battle			1
maestro : @entity44 must stop @entity20 if they are to have any chance against @entity19 my @entity50 scouting report @entity51 shows good body language and good distribution but can be poor on crosses , particularly from corners			1
looks confident but at times he could be overconfident			2
@entity57 has been poor attacking in the final third in the friendlies and was not tested defensively one v one			2
he can be poor in possession and always looks like he ’s got an error in his game			1
@entity66 a strong , dominant header of the ball in both boxes			2
he is growing as a leader but he does lack a bit of pace in tight areas and can be average in possession safe hands : @entity51 's confidence will help the team build from the back solid : @entity66 ( left ) and @entity81 ( right ) are strong in the air but lack pace at the top level @entity81 a whole - hearted player and a leader			1
attacks the ball well in the air at both ends and wants to score at set plays			2
his passing could be better but he is a fraction too slow to be top level			0
@entity94 is average defending the far post from crosses and can be guilty of poor one on one defending around his own box			0
he has good pace going forward but lacks real quality deep in the final third			0
@entity103 now playing a deeper role and is @entity44 ’s quarter back			1
can open teams up and is very good switching the play and shows good discipline in the role , rarely leaving the middle of the pitch			0
shield : @entity103 and @entity113 can protect the back four in deep - lying midfielder roles @entity113 an energetic midfielder and a good athlete who has an eye for a goal , particularly around the edge of the box			1
he is a simple passer and links play well , but he is not a spectacular player			0
@entity122 a great athlete , particularly tracking opposition full backs and shows good energy			0
always has a positive attitude on the ball whether through passing or running with it but lacks real technical skill			0
@entity11 will sit tight and play on @entity20			1
has lost a yard of pace but links play so well			0
he is one of @entity44 ’s leaders and has the technical ability to score around the box			1
with the hot conditions i feel the whole game will be too much for him , so expect him to be replaced after 60 minutes for a lad called @entity142			1
leading the way : @entity15 can be extremely dangerous from outside the box @entity145 quick , tenacious and always positive in possession , he has the speed to break between the lines and do damage in the final third			0
he is all right foot but anything can happen with this kid			0
@entity15 can be magic , can be a match - winner and can be bang average			1
but around the box he ’s always looking to try and get a shot in and needs to be watched carefully			0
substitute @entity13 will make plenty of changes but the boy @entity142 is the closest to @entity162 i ’ve seen			1
he ’s got tricks , skills , top technical ability and is always looking to score or find an incisive pass to create a scoring opportunity			0
when this boy comes on something will happen			0
wing wizard : @entity145 ( left ) offers pace and tenacity from the flanks back - up : @entity174 misses out on a place in the starting line - up against @entity19 @entity177 well , what did you expect ? with just days to go and a lifetime ’s dreams ahead , one bad tackle , one poor challenge or a bit of hard luck and you ’re out of the @entity187			1
over the last 10 days we have seen @entity19 ’s @entity191 break his leg , @entity188 of @entity189 hurt his back and @entity195 ’s @entity194 injure his ankle			1
playing against @entity197 , who are extremely physical with strong athletic , tough players , was a tricky encounter for the last warm - up game for the young lions			1
but thankfully they came through and there was no way they were going to over exert themselves and put themselves in danger missing out			2
agony : @entity194 is one of several talented stars set to miss the @entity187 with injury @entity213 as a very passionate @entity50 who loves the flag of @entity215 , is very proud of his country , who was stood in @entity218 with the barmy army supporting our cricket team and as an @entity44 supporter watched the team in the @entity187 in @entity224 and @entity225 after doing the full length of @entity218 ’s famous @entity227 in a @entity228 in just one day to get there in time , i can not and will never , ever pick anybody to beat my beloved @entity44			1
forget @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and the rest of them			0
for me it ’s @entity238			0
believe : forget the likes of @entity231 and @entity233 , @entity44 can lift the @entity242 trophy my week ... on tuesday i played in the @entity243 and @entity244 at the @entity246 charity golf day at @entity247			1
it ’s a lovely spot just between @entity249 and @entity250 down by the river			0
both gentlemen are big enough and strong enough to look like @entity253 , @entity255 ’s famously tough centre back but they helped raise a great deal of money for the charity , which does vital research into children ’s healthcare			0
and once again @entity262 put on a tremendous day			2
as the speeches at the end of the day were being made , sir @entity263 revealed that he ’d brought along with him a little box that we might all want to look at			0
rewarding : sir @entity268 promised to bring his five gold medal to the next @entity244 everyone was intrigued until he opened the box and inside were four small , saucer - sized olympic gold medals			2
he then , believe it or not , gave them to the first table of golfers and guests and they were nonchalantly passed around the room for us all to take pictures and touch the gold medals			0
it was pretty magical from such a humble @entity284 hero			0
sir @entity268 congratulated everyone taking part and thanked @entity263 for bringing his four gold medals			0
he ended the day by saying next time he would have to bring his box with five in it .			0

@entity20 must be stopped if @entity44 are going to defeat @entity19
@entity11 can help @entity13 's side put *pressure* on the @entity40 midfielder
@entity174 misses out in @entity0 's starting line - up for the opening game
@entity0 claims @entity44 can win the the @entity242
