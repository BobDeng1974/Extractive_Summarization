hundreds of thousands of frail and elderly people are being hit by the growing culture of so - called ' clock - watch care ' , the research revealed ( file picture , posed by models ) the report comes after charities and trade unions last year demanded an end to clock - watch care , an issue which the @entity29 has repeatedly highlighted through its dignity for the @entity32 campaign			2

‘ people who may be vulnerable are not being treated with the care and attention they deserve , ’ she said			2
‘ strict restrictions on time mean that people are not being treated with dignity , their needs are being ignored and care workers can not do a satisfactory job			0
’ care agencies are ‘ exploiting ’ home helps , the report said , with up to 220,000 workers in effect being paid less than the minimum wage because the firms pay them only for the visits and not the amount of time taken to travel between them			0
