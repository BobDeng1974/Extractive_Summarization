by @entity0 married with a child , @entity1 and @entity2 from @entity4 , say they 're just like any other couple , apart from one slight difference -- they like to drink each other 's blood			1
@entity2 and @entity10 , who appeared on @entity11 to encourage more open - mindedness for their lifestyle , are part of the @entity17 's 15,000 strong vampire community			1
self - confessed vampire @entity2 , likened the act of slurping his partners blood to sex and said , ' when you 're drinking each others blood you 're connected to each others souls			1
' he said the taste did n't make him feel sick but admitted , ' it 's not like strawberries -- it 's got a metallic taste			2
' i used to go to gatherings where the exchange of blood would happen , ' explained @entity10 , who was keen to point out that it was safe and nothing for the public to be scared about			1
she assured viewers that they do n't lurk around in the dark and only drink blood in the confines of the vampire community			1
' everyone is completely vetted to check they have no mental health history and have a clean blood record , ' she said			1
' everyone has a full examination - mentally and physically			2
' ' you pick one partner you 're totally happy with and it 's very safe , clean and sterile			1
' when @entity64 then inquired if it was form of sex , she replied , ' yes , of course ! ' we are very health conscious - as you would be when having sex			1
we are very responsible , ' she added			2
@entity10 ( left ) used to go to vampire gatherings to get her blood fix before she met @entity2 ( right ) but one thing that really gets @entity10 's blood boiling is @entity77 's portrayal of vampires			1
' it really makes me mad ! ' she said			2
' people are so misled and easily influenced by things in @entity77			2
interview with two vampires : the couple say they want to change misconceptions about the bloody - thirsty lifestyle ' i can look into the mirror and do my hair ! ' she said referring to the myth that if vampires look at their own reflection the mirror cracks			0
so what actually goes on behind vampires ' bedroom doors ? ' you can have a ceremonial pin to draw blood , ' @entity2 explained			1
' you do n't need a lot , just a small dab			0
' ' i do it from my neck just behind me ear , ' he said revealing a tattoo of a vampire bite on the side of his neck			1
' and we do try to use same spot every time			0
' ' it 's not cut deep enough to scar			0
it 's not self harm , ' @entity10 was quick to add			0
@entity10 blames @entity77 for the misunderstanding surrounding vampires ' scary image ( as depicted above ) ' the amount of blood you drawer depends on what you eat and drink because that affects blood flow , ' he explained			1
' but we use whatever comes out -- i would n't keep cutting , ' he said			0
of course , their hobby comes with a health warning and they admitted it 's ' enormously dangerous '			0
' it ca n't just be done because you feel like it			0
you have to know what you 're doing , ' said @entity2			1
' it 's our spiritual connection to each other			1
we have a child , which makes us as close as we can be			2
but the next step is to be joined by our souls			0
but @entity2 swears his love for @entity10 trumps his vampire lifestyle			1
' if one of us wanted to stop , it would n't be over , ' he said			0
' i see it as bonus			0
it 's something we 're both into and a big part of our life			1
but if it was to go away we would n't need to find someone else			0
also on the programme was psychologist , dr @entity161 , who has been studying the vampires for ten years			0
' it 's a religion , ' he explained			2
' it 's taken me 6 years to get the trust of the community so i can begin my research			0
it was very difficult because they are often mocked as society does n't understand them			0
' i 've found out that these are normal people			0
they may need to consume blood and psychic energy - but they may not actually like that about themselves			2
' you can watch the full interview here			0
