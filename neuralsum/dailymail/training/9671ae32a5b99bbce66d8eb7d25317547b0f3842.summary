they may be newly - crowned @entity1 title winners , after defying @entity2 at the @entity3 , but @entity4 will still go into saturday ’s champions ’ @entity1 final as underdogs , in most people ’s estimation			1
@entity10 ’s side can consider themselves worthy champions after going behind at the @entity3 but bouncing back with an equaliser to force the draw they needed to break the @entity1 ’s long - running duopoly and finish above @entity2 and @entity16			1
man on a mission : @entity4 coach @entity10 is aiming to lead his side to @entity21 glory main man : @entity23 trained ahead of the final with @entity16 but can they round off an unforgettable campaign by getting the better of @entity16 in an eagerly - awaited all - @entity16 @entity28 final in @entity29 ? with @entity30 in the form of his life and @entity33 already looking at home in the company of @entity16 ’s galacticos , few are backing them to pull off an improbable double			1
if they do once more respond to @entity10 ’s inspirational promptings , in the same way that took them past @entity44 in the semi-final , it will bear comparison with other upsets in the competition ’s illustrious history			1
here are five of the best			0
@entity51 3 - 3 @entity52 ( aet : @entity51 3 - 2 on pens ) , @entity55 , may 25 , 2005 - @entity51 ’s players were stunned when they trudged off at half - time , but not as stunned as @entity52 ’s were the best part of two hours later			2
all bets were off after goals from @entity61 and @entity62 ( 2 ) gave @entity52 a 3 - 0 interval lead			2
all except spread bets on the margin of @entity51 ’s defeat , that is			0
but it all changed after a tactical masterclass from @entity70 , who replaced full - back @entity71 with midfielder @entity73 , switched to a 3 - 5 - 2 formation and saw the seemingly - impossible begin to unfold			2
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 forced extra-time , and @entity51 pulled off the comeback to end them all by holding their nerve in the penalty shoot - out			2
the comeback to end all comebacks : @entity75 lifts the @entity21 for @entity51 we 've done it ! @entity51 players run to goalkeeper @entity87 to celebrate spot kick king : @entity51 's goalkeeper @entity87 saves a penalty from @entity52 's @entity91 @entity105 2 - 1 @entity101 , @entity29 , may 25 , 1967 – we were still to enter the age of colour television , let alone widescreen and hd , but the grainy images of @entity96 ’s heroic @entity95 defying the odds against @entity100 ’s seemingly - impregnable @entity99 champions are as vivid as ever			1
@entity101 had won the @entity21 , as it was known then , in ’ 64 and ’ 65 and looked on for a third in four years after @entity106 converted a seventh - minute penalty , following a @entity109 foul on @entity110			1
the script was made for @entity101 to sit back and soak up any amount of pressure with their renowned defensive resilience			0
but @entity105 had other ideas , and , after equalising through left - back @entity119 in the 63rd minute , they became @entity122 ’s first @entity28 champions with a close - range finish by @entity124 six minutes from time			1
the @entity95 : @entity105 beat @entity101 in 1967 to lift the play - off final @entity126 1 - 0 @entity52 , @entity127 , may 26 , 1993 – under @entity128 , @entity52 were known as @entity129 and were in the middle of a spell of domestic dominance that brought them three successive @entity99 titles			1
no - one gave @entity126 much hope , and a look at the group stages underlined why			0
while @entity52 breezed through with a 100 per cent record , @entity126 scraped through with three wins and three draws against @entity141 , @entity142 and an out - of - sorts @entity143			0
but defender @entity146 ’s 43rd - minute header proved decisive against a star - studded @entity52 side containing the likes of @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity61 , @entity152 and @entity153			1
upset : @entity126 beat the odds and defeated @entity52 @entity155 3 - 1 @entity156 , @entity127 , may 28 , 1997 – @entity156 had just wrapped up their 24th @entity99 title under @entity158 and were strong favourites , particularly after beating @entity160 home and away en route to topping their group with five wins and a draw			1
@entity155 only finished second in their group , to @entity4 , but they unearthed an unlikely hero in the final , in the shape of midfield anchor man @entity169			2
the @entity170 may be having his problems as manager of @entity173 , but he had little difficulty shackling @entity175 in a man - marking job that proved decisive			0
he even found time to lay on the opening goal for @entity180 , who doubled the @entity181 ’ advantage , before @entity183 hit back in the second half			0
an unlikely @entity155 triumph was secured when local lad @entity186 scored 16 seconds after going on as substitute			0
@entity181 joy : @entity155 beat @entity156 in 1997 to win the @entity21 @entity189 1 - 1 @entity44 ( aet : @entity44 4 - 3 on pens ) , @entity127 , may 19 , 2012 – the venue gives a clue as to why this counted as an upset			1
@entity189 ’s glittering @entity196 was the stage , and it was set for @entity199 ’ team to bring the trophy home , two years after the heartbreak of losing to @entity101			0
add the fact that @entity44 were in turmoil after sacking @entity209 two months earlier and finishing sixth in the @entity210 , a distant 25 points behind champions @entity204 , and a @entity189 win looked assured			2
it was all going to plan when @entity213 ’s downward header reared up off the turf and beat @entity215 seven minutes from time			0
but this was to be @entity218 ’s finest hour in a @entity44 shirt			0
just as @entity220 was bracing itself for an all - night party , @entity218 powered an 88th - minute header past @entity223 to force extra time that duly gave way to a penalty shoot - out			0
incredibly , @entity226 missed @entity189 ’s fifth to leave the way clear for @entity218 to nervelessly convert the decisive kick			0
@entity230 is the colour : @entity44 beat @entity189 on penalties in @entity127 to win the @entity21			1

@entity10 's side are the newly - crowned @entity1 champions
despite @entity4 's success this *season* , many will still see @entity16 as the favourites to lift the @entity21
an @entity4 win will bear comparison with other upsets in the @entity21 's illustrious history
