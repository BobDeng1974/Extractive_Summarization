by @entity0 a senior @entity2 mp has triggered a new immigration storm by saying @entity4 was right to brand @entity5 – the voter who famously challenged him – ‘ a bigoted woman ’			1
@entity9 , the mp for @entity10 , suggested to colleagues that the former prime minister was right to rail against @entity14 on the campaign trail four years ago			1
when a former @entity2 official brought up the incident , mr @entity9 said he felt that mr @entity4 had been ‘ too grovelling and apologetic ’			1
a senior @entity2 mp suggested to colleagues that former prime minister @entity4 , pictured left , was correct to call @entity5 , pictured right , a ' bigoted woman ' while on the campaign trail in 2010 damaging : the gaffe overshadowed the 2010 campaign he added : ‘ she was a bigoted woman and that ’s all there is to it '			1
on a calamitous day just a week before the 2010 general election , mrs @entity5 , a retired council worker , had an impromptu chat with mr @entity4 as he visited her hometown of @entity32			1
but in a gaffe which would overshadow the campaign , he left his microphone on his lapel as he was driven away			2
he was heard telling aides : ‘ that was a disaster			0
you should never have put me with that woman ’			2
when asked by one of his staff what she had said , he replied : ‘ everything			0
she is just a sort of bigoted woman , she said she used to be @entity2			1
’ mrs @entity5 , a lifelong @entity2 voter , had quizzed mr @entity4 about the state of the public finances , how her grandchildren could afford to go to university and why her pension was being taxed			1
she then moved on to immigration , telling him : ‘ you ca n’t say anything about the immigrants …			0
all these @entity56 what are coming in — where are they flocking from ? ’ the lifelong @entity2 supporter confronted mr @entity4 while he was on the election campaign trail in @entity32 and quizzed him about the state of the public finances the grandmother said it was ‘ drummed in ’ to her as a child the need to help vulnerable people , but said ‘ there ’s too many people now ’			1
when his comments were made public mr @entity4 went to her home to deliver a profuse apology and told journalists : ‘ i do n’t think she is that [ bigoted ]			1
’ he said he was ‘ mortified ’ and claimed he had misunderstood what she had said			0
@entity75 has insisted @entity2 has now been ‘ on a journey ’ about immigration and told an audience in @entity77 this week that people concerned about its impact are not prejudiced			0
but at a £ 100 - a - head fundraising dinner for mps and supporters at a smart @entity87 hotel this month where the incident was discussed , mr @entity9 , 59 , - a former pr executive and aide to shadow justice secretary @entity90 - did not take the same stance			1
' i am deeply sorry			2
what i said was wrong and can not be excused			0
i will be writing to mrs @entity5 to offer a sincere and personal apology			2

yesterday he issued a statement saying : ‘ i am deeply sorry			2
what i said was wrong and can not be excused			0
i will be writing to mrs @entity5 to offer a sincere and personal apology			2
’ he had been speaking after one of the panelists at the event said : ‘ with the @entity4 incident … my personal opinion was the woman said ‘ these people ’ talking about eastern @entity112			1
‘ she also said where do these people , these eastern @entity112 come from ? they come from eastern @entity112 do n’t they ? @entity9 , mp for @entity10 , was recorded saying : ' was n't he too apologetic and grovelling to that woman ? in my opinion he was			1
' ‘ so my point is should n’t @entity4 have said ‘ she seems to me to be slightly bigoted , i only had a brief moment with her , if i offended her in any way i apologise			1
’ he added : ‘ was n’t he [ @entity4 ] too apologetic and grovelling to that woman ? in my opinion he was			1
’ the event was held two weeks ago , just ahead of the local elections in which @entity2 lost council seats to @entity129 , which also topped the poll at the @entity112 elections			0
mr @entity4 went to mrs @entity5 's home , pictured , to apologise in person after the embarrassing gaffe mrs @entity5 , 69 , who has said in the past she was deeply hurt by mr @entity4 ’s comments , did not wish to speak last night			1
a widow since her husband @entity137 , a painter and decorator , died of cancer eight years ago , she worked with disabled children for three decades , and lives alone in the town			0

and now i ’m absolutely ashamed of saying i ’m @entity2 ’			0

he said : ‘ @entity4 was right to apologise for his comments , i think the vast majority of the public believe that			1
he clearly overstepped the mark			0
i ’ve spent a lot of time with @entity5 , she ’s not racist she just has a concern about immigration			2
‘ i ’m surprised there are @entity2 mps who still think she was bigoted and i ’m pretty disappointed			2
people were concerned about immigration then , and they are concerned about it now			0
‘ the sad thing is there ’s this unhealthy consensus within the mainstream political parties that immigration is always a good thing			0
sometimes it ’s a bad thing and can adversely affect hard working people			0
it ’s time to have a straight and honest debate about it			0
’ @entity180 mp @entity179 said last night : ‘ behind the phony public statements , this shows nothing has changed when it comes to @entity2 ’s attitude to immigration			0
' @entity2 opened the door to uncontrolled immigration with no thought to its impacts on communities , and as @entity191 admitted , were even sending out search parties for migrants			0
‘ it ’s the conservatives who are building an immigration system that is fair to @entity197 citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system or flout the law ’ .			0
