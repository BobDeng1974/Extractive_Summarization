there are countless optical illusions that make objects appear to spin , change colour and move of their own accord - but this may be the most powerful one yet			2
the video creates what is known as a motion after - effect ( @entity11 ) and is a phenomenon often called the ‘ waterfall illusion ’ after being spotted at a waterfall in @entity14 , @entity15 in 1834			1
it causes cells in the brain that are sensitive to a certain direction of movement to tire , which then activates the cells that respond to the opposite direction			1
this makes stationary objects appear to move			1

it causes cells in the brain that are sensitive to a certain direction of movement to tire , which then activates the cells that respond to the opposite direction			1
this makes stationary objects appear to move in that opposite direction the illusion itself is n’t new			1
it was first referenced in ancient @entity47 texts , although the origin is debated			1
many scientists agree @entity50 first mentioned the visual illusion in his @entity52 , but the correct direction was said to be first reported by @entity54 in his poem @entity55			2
the first clear description of the motion after - effect was recorded by @entity58 in 1820 , who observed it after looking at a cavalry parade			1
@entity62 then observed and reported the effect in 1834 while watching a waterfall at @entity14 in @entity15			2
this demonstration was created from a view of the @entity67			0
mr @entity62 noticed that the effect can be seen when staring at a waterfall while keeping eyes steady			0
the motion after - effect ( @entity11 ) can be explained by changes in visual neurons that respond in certain ways to moving parts within an image			1
in the brain , there are cells are tuned to respond to different features and directions of an image or stimulus			2
for example , there are cells in the brain that are sensitive to motion in a clockwise direction , but there are also cells that are sensitive to motion in the opposite direction			1
when there is no movement within an image , these cells produce roughly the same response			0
but , in the case of a simple @entity11 illusion , as the circles spin in a clockwise motion , the cells that are sensitive to this direction use energy and become tired			1
when the spinning stops , the cells sensitive to motion in an anti-clockwise direction take over and become active - in a bid to restore the balance			1
this causes even stationary items to look like they ’re moving in that opposite direction for a short time			1
versions of the spiral were then used in 1849 by the @entity117 physicist @entity116			0
during the video the outer rings spin anti-clockwise			0
a five - point shape features rings that move clockwise , while letters appear in the centre			0
there is also another spinning circle around the letters			0

this causes even stationary items to look like they ’re moving in that opposite , anti-clockwise direction for a short time			1
the longer the spinning , the more fatigued the clockwise cells get , and the more the opposite cells will be active to try and correct the imbalance of energy			1
in the case of this video , uploaded by @entity178 , focusing on the letters causes the cells to stay tuned on the motion			2
the variety of motions throughout the clip causes the cells to tire at different speeds , and the length of the clip combines to create an illusion that causes objects to move in a variety of directions			2
when looking directly at a ring , our brains notice the motion of the spots , not the stripes inside the spots			0
as a result the circles move anticlockwise			0
when looking at a ring in the peripheral vision , the brain processes the motion of the stripes , and the circles move in the same direction , which in this case is clockwise and it explains why the affect can last for a significant time			2
the video does come with a warning that the affect can last for a ‘ few seconds ’ but this can be longer			0
it is thought that stationary black and white so - called ‘ afterimages ’ originate in nerve cells in the retina			2

mr @entity62 noticed that the effect can be seen when staring at a waterfall while keeping eyes steady			0
this means that these afterimages do n’t transfer from one eye to the other			0
but , research on monkeys revealed that neurons that respond to visual motion and direction take place in the primary visual cortex			1
this suggests the motion after - effects are due to cortical , and not retinal , processing			0
another similar illusion that uses directional cells is called @entity257			0
the trick was originally presented at the @entity260 conference in 2008 and is so famous , neurologists , psychologists and philosophers have been studying why these visual ' changes ' seem to occur for years			0
there are two sources of visual motion present in the illusion			2
this includes the circles themselves , and stripes within each circle - known as what ’s called ‘ first ’ and ‘ second order ’ motions			0
the black and white stripes in the spots move around an axis , and these spots move around the central dot			0
the stripes on the left - hand , or red , side are moving in the same direction as the spots , but on the right - hand , or yellow , side the stripes and spots move in opposite directions			2
looking directly at a ring of circles , our brains notice the motion of the spots , and not the stripes , and as a result the circles move anticlockwise			0
in this instance , the stripes appear to flicker rather than move			0
however , when looking at a ring in the peripheral vision , the brain process the motion of the stripes within the spots , and the circles appear to move in the same direction as the stripes , or clockwise			2
in the case of a simple @entity11 illusion , as the circles spin in a clockwise motion , the cells that are sensitive to this direction use energy and become tired			1
when the spinning stops , the cells sensitive to motion in an anti-clockwise direction take over			1
this causes even stationary items to look like they ’re moving the motion after - effect was first referenced in ancient @entity47 texts , although the origin is debated			1
the @entity322 were said to have used optical illusions in their architecture , including the @entity325 ( pictured )			0
each of the columns was built with a slight bulge in the middle , to make them appear straight and uniform			0

the illusion causes what ’s known as a motion after - effect ( @entity11 )
it is caused when visual neurons react to moving objects or stimulus
cells that respond to motion in a clockwise direction become tired
when the spinning stops , the cells sensitive to motion in the opposite direction become active
this makes stationary objects look like they ’re moving in that direction
the phenomenon was first reported in texts *written* in ancient @entity47
