' but based on her background , she ’d only been governor for , what , two years ? i do n’t think she passed that test of being ready to take over and i think that was a mistake			0
’ @entity0 told @entity30 on monday : ' my point basically dealt with the process in terms of that basic requirement : is this person prepared to step in to be @entity36 when they ’re picked ? quick to respond : @entity2 was quick to hit back saying @entity0 was listening to ' a false narrative over the last four years ' ‘ i was asked if i thought the @entity6 process in ‘ 08 had been well done or was it a mistake , and i said i thought it was a mistake			1
’ @entity2 was quick to hit back , making reference to an incident when @entity0 accidentally shot his friend while quail hunting			2
she said : ‘ seeing as how @entity0 , excuse me , vice president @entity0 , never misfires , then evidently he ’s quite convinced that what he had evidently read about me by the lamestream media , having been written , what i believe is a false narrative over the last four years			1
’ @entity6 defended his decision to pick @entity2 saying he was ' proud of @entity2 '			2
to @entity2 's defence : senior senator @entity6 ( right ) defended his decision to pick @entity2 saying he was proud of her while even @entity0 's daughter @entity52 ( left ) posted her disagreement with his comments on her @entity56 account daughter 's tweet : @entity59 came to @entity2 's defence , speaking out against her father 's comments even @entity0 ’s daughter also came to @entity2 ’s defence , posting on @entity56 : ' rarely do i disagree with best vp ever but @ @entity64 more qualified than @entity65 and @entity66 combined			1

' during the interview , @entity0 was also quick to condemn president @entity65 as a ' worse ' president than @entity71			2
he said : ' i obviously am not a big fan of president @entity65			0
i think he ’s been one of our weakest presidents			0
