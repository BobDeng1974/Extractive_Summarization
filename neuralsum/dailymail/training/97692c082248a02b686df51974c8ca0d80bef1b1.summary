@entity0 's players celebrate after @entity6 scores the hosts ' second try at @entity2 @entity5 goes over for @entity0 's third try , but it is n't enough to prevent defeat for @entity38 's men @entity5 - 6 never anything other than committed and brave but those question marks over lack of creativity persist			1
@entity44 - 6 guilty of an early knock - on following a sharp break but will again be frustrated by lack of opportunities			2
may - 6 what is the point in picking the @entity52 ace if he is hardly ever going to see the ball ? starved of the ball for the second week running			2

@entity0 centre @entity97 bursts through a challenge during @entity0 's clash with @entity3 @entity0 's @entity101 is brought down by @entity3 duo @entity102 and @entity11 @entity103 - 6 huge questions over whether he should have played following head knock last week			1
line out good and work - rate high but looked heavy legged			0
@entity109 - 6 carried well in the second half but gave away too many penalties and will be frustrated by breakdown work			2

@entity138 - 7 defensively outstanding and powerful carrying in the best traditions of @entity3 centres			1
@entity143 ( c ) - 7 not as many carrying opportunities as the @entity146 skipper would have liked but defensively he is a rock			0
@entity148 - 6 a shame one of the world ’s greatest ever wingers was not given the ball to show what he can do			0
@entity0 's @entity17 is brought down by try - scorer @entity10 while @entity155 watches on @entity0 's @entity103 charges down a kick from @entity3 's @entity157 @entity157 - 8 an excellent all - round display with clever kicking from hand and tidy distribution			1
goal kicking also first class			2
@entity9 - 7 very low error count and formed a sound partnership with @entity157			1
@entity167 - 6 ( @entity168 75 ) @entity3 ’s scrum was one of the few areas that creaked as the @entity172 was well tamed			1
@entity173 - 7 ( @entity174 61 ) nasty , aggressive and combative within the laws , just			0
a nuggety performer who made a sound contribution			0
@entity174 - 6 ( @entity178 64 ) not a brilliant scrummaging performance but a fairly solid day at the coalface			0
@entity3 's star man was @entity157 who scored three penalties , two conversions and a drop goal @entity3 's players celebrate after @entity9 scores a try for the @entity3 at @entity2 etzbeth - 8 ( @entity188 64 ) did n’t have the sort of influence he would have wanted but remains a muscular enforcer of the highest quality			1
