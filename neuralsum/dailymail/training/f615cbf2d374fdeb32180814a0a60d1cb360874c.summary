by @entity0 and @entity1 men wanting to have children should stop smoking cannabis as it could have a serious impact on their fertility , the world 's largest study of the effects of lifestyle on sperm suggests			1
the drug doubles the chances of men under the age of 30 producing abnormal sperm - something that can have a serious impact on their chances of having children , according to the research			2
experts from the universities of @entity25 and @entity26 found that smoking cannabis was the only lifestyle choice to have a negative impact on sperm production - contradicting long - held beliefs that fertility is reduced by obesity , alcohol and tobacco consumption , and the wearing of tight underwear			1
cut it out : men wanting to have children should quit cannabis as it can have an impact on the size and shape of their sperm , potentially reducing fertility the only lifestyle choice that had a major impact was smoking cannabis , which can reduce a man ’s fertility by altering the size and shape of his sperm			1
a similar effect was discovered in the summer , although experts suggest it is n’t heat but probably the length of the day and hormonal changes that are responsible			0
when less than 4 per cent of a man ’s sperm has a normal size and shape , statistics show he will find it harder to father a child and may need help from fertility techniques , including @entity69			2
teams from the universities of @entity25 and @entity26 carried out the world ’s largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm			1
using data from 2,249 men attending fertility clinics around the @entity80 , they compared the medical history and personal habits of 318 participants with less than 4 per cent of normal sperm and 1,652 whose sperm was of higher quality			2
men in the first group were nearly twice as likely to have used cannabis in the three months before giving a sample , if they were aged under 30			0
they were also nearly twice as likely to have produced the sample in the summer months			0
surprising : the study found that the seasons have an effect of sperm quality while other factors - such as alcohol and obesity - do not the scientists believe younger men were most affected by cannabis simply because they were more likely to use greater quantities			1
chemicals in the drug itself , not the tobacco used in ‘ joints ’ , were probably responsible since cigarette smoking had little effect on sperm			1
one of the team leaders , dr @entity112 , senior lecturer in andrology – the study of male health – at @entity25 , said habitual cannabis users who wanted to become fathers should kick the habit for at least three months			2
‘ i ca n’t tell you definitively that your sperm will improve , but that ’s a reasonable assumption , ’ he said			0
he said the summer influence was surprising but it did not appear to be linked to heat or significantly alter seasonal conception patterns			0
‘ we did n’t expect this , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s complete conjecture on my part , but it could be a sunlight effect			0
day - length affects our hormones and vitamin d in all sorts of ways			0
’ he added that men wanting to be fathers should not wait until winter			0
however , the study , published in the journal @entity140 , found that abstaining from sexual activity for more than six days improved sperm quality			1
it was possible that unmeasured factors , such as the quality of sperm dna , influenced the results , said the researchers .			1

@entity151 's largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm has been published
researchers found link between sperm quality and the time of year
but the scientists from @entity25 and @entity26 *debunked* some *theories*
they found factors including alcohol , smoking and obesity had no effect
