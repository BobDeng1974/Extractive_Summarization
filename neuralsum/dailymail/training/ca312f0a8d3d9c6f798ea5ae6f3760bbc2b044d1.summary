this is the moment a dog who was swept out to sea was saved from certain death by a lifeboat crew			2
the @entity6 disappeared after going for a dip while walking with its owner along the @entity11 beach , @entity12 , on sunday morning			1
her owner searched with two kayakers for the poor animal , but they were unable to find her - leaving the devastated owner to break the news to his wife			0
@entity23 staff then began a search for the dog , finding her on these rocks after hearing barking @entity35 : @entity36 , @entity12 , @entity23 spotted the animal half a mile out to sea standing on some rocks , pictured but luckily the coastguard managed to contact the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) volunteers who were on a training exercise			1
the crew from @entity36 , @entity12 , was diverted and started a search for the missing dog			1
at half a mile out to sea the volunteers were about to give up the search but then they suddenly heard barking coming from the terrified lab shaking on rocks on a reef			1

lucky : the animal 's owner had already searched for the dog with two kayakers before the @entity23 were called attached : staff aboard the boat secured the shivering animal , latching a rope onto her collar all aboard : staff then gently pulled the animal - who was soaked through - on to their lifeboat they tried to keep her warm as they returned to the beach where they wrapped the dog in a blanket and took her back to their lifeboat station			2
she was then reunited with her owners			0
an @entity23 spokesman said : ' we are sure this will make their @entity88 much more enjoyable with the return of their pet			0
' we believe the @entity6 was a nursing mother so this rescue will make a great difference to her pups			0
' easy does it : the female is lifted to the warmth of the boat by a team member good girl ! the animal looks a little relieved to be off the rocks and with a staff member			2
