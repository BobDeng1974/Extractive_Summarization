a daughter who reportedly abandoned her mother in deplorable living conditions has been arrested and charged with abuse			1
@entity4 , of @entity5 , @entity6 , was taken into custody after her 63 - year - old mother was found covered in ' bedbugs , fleas , feces and urine			1
' the woman claims she had been left alone for days , and was discovered by a neighbor as she was crying out for help from inside her home			1
' ' it was just real deplorable conditions in which she was living , ' @entity43 spokesman @entity42 told @entity47			2
@entity4 , 42 , has now been charged her with neglect of an adult			1
@entity4 's daughter however , @entity51 , is disputing these claims , and demanding that her mother be released from jail			1
@entity55 says her mother was always present and that the home was not as ' filthy ' as authorities are claiming , this even though photos from the scene seem to back up their claims			1
trash is everywhere , there is no room to walk , and the conditions to not look at all livable for anyone , let alone an elderly person			2
hard to get by : the 63 - year - old woman , who has not been named , was covered in fleas , feces , bedbugs and urine unimaginable : she was found after calling for help and said she had been alone for days ca n't breathe : authorities had to wear hazmat suits in order to remove the woman none of that seems to make a difference to @entity55 though , who continues to play the role of dutiful daughter			1
' my mom is not responsible for what a grown woman does			0
ya 'll need to let her out			0
she did n't do anything , ' pleaded @entity55			0
' she 's got a bond for $ 5,000			0
look where we live at			0
we ca n't afford that			0
' denying claims : @entity51 ( above ) the victim 's granddaughter , claims that they are the victims of her grandmother 's mistreatment what 's more , @entity100 claims she and her mother were the victims of mistreatment from her grandmother			0
the two woman will no longer have to worry about that however , as the elderly victim has been placed in a nursing home			2
self , meanwhile , remains behind bars .			0
