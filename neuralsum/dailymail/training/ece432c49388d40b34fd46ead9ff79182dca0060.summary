women said they needed 15 more days of sleep than what they get in a survey of 2,000 adults @entity7 's women need at least at 15 days more sleep each year than they get , says a new survey			1
they feel worse off than men – who reckon they are 10 days short of the ideal sleep ration			2
overall , @entity7 say they need seven and a half hours a night , but they are getting fewer than six hours 40 minutes			1
experts believe insufficient sleep has become a worldwide epidemic , with chronic sleep deprivation linked to medical problems such as obesity , diabetes , cancer and immune deficiency			2
previous @entity23 research even found lack of sleep could double the signs of skin ageing , including fine lines			2
the latest survey of 2,000 @entity31 adults showed men claim to get less sleep than women , but also need less time in bed			1
the survey showed men were getting 6 hours 3 mins sleep on average , compared with 6 hours 40 mins they believe they should have – a sleep deficit of 40 mins a night			1
over a year , the shortfall would reach 10 days 3 hours			2
women claim to get 6 hours 21 mins each night – but want 7hrs 23 mins			1
the sleep deficit of 1 hr 2mins a night adds up to a staggering 15 days 17 hours annually			1
the figures emerged in a survey of the nation ’s sleeping habits for a new app , @entity48 , which allows users to donate to a charity of their choice every time they hit the snooze button on their phone alarm			0
fewer than half of @entity7 actually wake up to an alarm clock or phone alarm			1
almost a fifth of people wake naturally , and most of the remainder are awakened by partners , pets or children			0
a quarter of those surveyed by @entity73 said they always got a good night ’s sleep , but almost one in five were kept awake by work worries , and one in eight had their sleep affected by issues with family or friends			2
snoring by a partner kept one in 10 awake while a further seven per cent suffered because of their own snoring , or conditions such as sleep apnoea			1
inevitably , women suffer far more with snoring partners : 15.5 per cent said this kept them awake , compared with just 6 per cent of men			1
one in four people said needing the toilet was the thing guaranteed to get them up			0
research suggests seven and a half hours of sleep a night is the optimum level for good health			1
more women complained about being kept awake by a snoring partner while men said they needed less time in bed ( file image ) earlier this year scientists at @entity106 last month found just one week of poor sleep can disrupt hundreds of genes linked to stress , immunity and inflammation			1
other research shows women are more likely to seek help for sleeping problems – but they are twice as likely to become reliant on medication			0
@entity119 of @entity120 , which created @entity48 , said the app would help good causes because every time a user hit the snooze button , a small sum of money was donated to their charity of choice			0
he said ‘ with so many people struggling to get enough sleep , it ’s no wonder so many of us feel the need to snooze every day			0
‘ now , using an app , we can use that snooze time to help others and snooze guilt - free ! ’ @entity135 , director of fundraising at @entity31 , one of the charities involved , said ‘ extreme snoozing is a brilliant way of fundraising if you do n’t fancy climbing mountains and skydiving			0
‘ @entity144 @entity31 is conscious of the clock , with one man dying from the disease every hour in the @entity31			0
we can not afford to hit the snooze button , but our supporters can			0
’ @entity154 , director of fundraising at @entity156 ‘ we all struggle to get out of bed on cold and dark winter mornings , and anything that can make getting up more bearable can only be a good thing			0
‘ waking up and snoozing with @entity48 is a fun and simple way to kick - start every day , whilst making a donation to @entity156 at the same time			0
’ @entity160 , chief executive of @entity161 ’s , said : ‘ @entity161 ’s is here for everyone and anyone affected by cancer as well as their family and friends and we are delighted to have been selected as one of @entity48 ’s charity partners			0
