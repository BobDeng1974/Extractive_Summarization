@entity1 customers have voiced their anger after receiving a copy of the latest gq as a free gift with their catalog			1
the men 's magazine , which features a topless @entity9 on the cover , was distributed to select @entity1 's subscribers as part of a deal the retailer had with publisher @entity15 , according to the @entity17			1
angry customers have taken to the brand 's @entity20 page , saying they were sent ' smut , ' ' pornography , ' and ' filth			0
' probably not the best partnership ! @entity1 , a catalog that sells school uniforms and other conservative clothing , send its customers a free copy of @entity4 featuring a topless @entity9 ' my 14 - year - old son brought in the mail today and was quite disturbed and fascinated by a " gift " @entity1 sent us - a copy of @entity4 with an absolutely obscene cover ! ' said one recipient			1
' while @entity4 may have been a reputable magazine at one time , today it seems to have sunken to the level of smut			2
' another woman said : ' i have 8 wonderful and innocent little grandchildren for whom i purchase a lot of @entity1 clothing , not to mention what i buy for myself			1
if one of them had seen that piece of trash in my mailbox , how would i explain the labels on their clothes ? ' one more mother echoed the sentiment : ' what part of me buying cute , age - appropriate kids clothing and a mom swimsuit made you think i wanted a subscription to @entity4 ? my 12 - year - old daughter brought in the mail and was quite horrified to see a magazine with a naked woman on the cover			1
' outraged ! @entity66 said ' words can not express ' how angry she is with the catalog angry ! @entity69 said she would n't have been able to explain the @entity4 to her eight ' wonderful and innocent ' grandchildren @entity71 ! @entity72 said her 12 - year - old daughter was ' horrified to see a magazine with a naked woman on the cover ' the company 's ceo , @entity77 , issued an apology yesterday , saying he was ' truly sorry ' and that there are ' simply no excuses ' for the ' mistake			1
' ' when we entered into a year - long partnership with @entity15 , ' he said , ' our goal was to reward our valued customers with magazine subscriptions highlighting fashion and lifestyle topics			2
' as a company , we are extremely apologetic that you have received this particular magazine on our behalf			2
' he said that all subscribers ' names were removed from the @entity4 mailing list , and they would instead be receiving a subscription to @entity100			0
while some customers were impressed with the letter , others called it ' canned ' or ' formulaic			0
' ' i think i was even more appalled at the excuse in the form of an apology , ' said one customer			0
' that they meant it as a gift to their male customers			0
that is absolutely disgusting and a major disrespect to your female customers			0
' said another : ' everything these days get diluted to " mistakes			0
" how about a case of just plain " poor judgment " on the part of its execs ! ' apology accepted ? ceo @entity77 called the action ' a mistake ' and there are ' no excuses ' not forgiven ! @entity131 said she was ' even more appalled at the excuse in the form of an apology ' that @entity1 sent customers watch what you say ! @entity138 said mr @entity77 should 've called the company 's error ' poor judgment ' rather than a ' mistake ' not everyone was offended , however , and many people are defending the brand 's actions , saying ' it 's just breasts			2
' ' a topless woman is n't any more pornographic than a topless man , ' said one woman on @entity20 's public wall , ' calling a topless woman pornographic is another form of body - shaming , and i 'm thankful i grew up in a home where i was taught that a body is just a body			2
' ' a topless woman is n't any more pornographic than a topless man ' a man also came to @entity1 's defense : ' for some strange reason , partially exposed female breasts apparently seem to have a propensity to irreversibly damage young , innocent minds			1
never mind the fact that these same young minds are exposed to blood , gore , war , religious extremism , bigotry , hatred , and violence with every click past a network news channel or daily newspaper cover			0
' provocative ! the @entity9 images inside the magazine are just as provocative as the cover it 's not a big deal ! @entity185 says people are overreacting who cares ? @entity188 says children are exposed to things far worse than female breasts @entity1 was founded in 1963 , and is based in @entity192 , @entity193			1
@entity194 purchased the company in 2002 for $ 1.9 billion in cash , according to @entity197 .			0
