@entity1 star @entity0 finally tied the knot with lingerie model @entity3 as the pair married at a lavish ceremony in @entity6			1
the 34 - year - old began dating the @entity10 - @entity9 model back in december 2008			1
while @entity3 has always been happy for @entity0 to put his career first , she made no secret of the fact that she had her eye on marriage			1
if @entity0 wins the title we will celebrate by him getting down on one knee			2
he told me i am the one for him			0
i hope he means it			0
’ while @entity0 , worth a reported £ 63million , did win that season , an engagement was not forthcoming			2
however @entity3 had her patience rewarded on @entity43 this year , with a ring reported to be worth £ 250,000			2
and the couple walked down the aisle on monday after a ten - month engagement			0
@entity0 had flings with a string of women including prince @entity52 ’s ex – 29 - year - old model @entity51 – before meeting @entity53 in @entity54 through mutual friends			1
but arm - in - arm and exchanging loving glances , the pair looked radiantly happy as they posed for photos and drove off into the sunset after the ceremony this week			0
the model has previously said : ‘ of course , i read about him being a playboy , but i do n’t see that side of him			0
we spend nights watching films and making sushi rather than going out to nightclubs			0
’ the pair have been soaking up the sunshine on the beautiful island of @entity74 congratulations : many fans took to @entity77 to congratulate the couple on their wedding rocky start : the @entity9 model first met @entity0 in 2008 in a hotel bar in @entity54 and originally perceived him to be something of a womaniser , turning him down when he first asked her out winning : it was n't until @entity0 became @entity87 in @entity88 in 2009 that she realised just how strong his love for her was , when he dedicated his win to her , live on television			1
