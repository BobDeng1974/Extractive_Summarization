the 78 - year - old succumbed to complications from pneumonia on thursday in @entity12 , @entity13 , where he lived in retirement			1
his large personality and public prominence during the nation 's first live - broadcast war made him the the most recognizable , and acclaimed , military commander since @entity20 and @entity21			1
a much - decorated combat soldier in @entity23 , @entity3 was known popularly as ' @entity3 ' for his notoriously explosive temper			1
he was also the mastermind behind the mechanics of @entity35 , co-authoring the official strategy of the defense of @entity38 , as well as the combat operations in @entity8 and @entity28			0
after the war , his popularity was nearly immeasurable			2
he received the @entity42 from president @entity43 , was given a standing ovation by @entity45 and was bestowed an honorary knighthood by @entity47 he was offered the job of chief of staff - the top position in the @entity51 - but turned it down			2
he retired from active duty in august 1991 - just six moths after the conclusion of the war			1
he lived in retirement in @entity12 , where he had served in his last military assignment as commander - in - chief of @entity59			1
that is the headquarters responsible for @entity5 military and security concerns in nearly 20 countries from the eastern @entity64 and @entity65 to @entity66			2
@entity3 became commander - in - chief of ' @entity59 ' in 1988 and when @entity7 invaded @entity8 three years later to punish it for allegedly stealing @entity28 oil reserves , he commanded @entity29 , the coalition of some 30 countries organized by then - president @entity43 that succeeded in driving the @entity28 out			1
at the peak of his postwar national celebrity , @entity3 - a self - proclaimed political independent - rejected suggestions that he run for office , and remained far more private than other generals , although he did serve briefly as a military commentator for @entity77			1
author of the war : @entity3 , seen here with president @entity43 in @entity38 in 1990 , drew up the battle plans for @entity29 and @entity29 diplomat : @entity3 , seen here with the emir of @entity85 , reached out to the leaders of several @entity88 countries to help build support for the @entity5 operation while focused primarily in his later years on charitable enterprises , he campaigned for president @entity92 in 2000 but was ambivalent about the 2003 invasion of @entity28 , saying he doubted victory would be as easy as the @entity95 and @entity96 predicted			1
in early 2003 he told the @entity97 the outcome was an unknown : long service : @entity3 earned a reputation for bravery during the @entity103 and was a highly - decorated officer ' what is postwar @entity28 going to look like , with the @entity106 and the @entity107 and the @entity108 ? that 's a huge question , to my mind			1
it really should be part of the overall campaign plan , ' he said			0
initially @entity3 had endorsed the invasion , saying he was convinced that former secretary of state @entity116 had given the @entity118 powerful evidence of @entity28 weapons of mass destruction			1
after that proved false , he said decisions to go to war should depend on what @entity118 weapons inspectors found			0
he seldom spoke up during the conflict , but in late 2004 , he sharply criticized then - defense secretary @entity127 and the @entity96 for mistakes that included inadequate training for @entity51 reservists sent to @entity28 and for erroneous judgments about @entity28			2
' in the final analysis i think we are behind schedule			0
... i do n't think we counted on it turning into jihad ( holy war ) , ' he said in an @entity77 interview			0
@entity3 was born august 24 , 1934 , in @entity141 , @entity142 , where his father , colonel @entity143 , founder and commander of the @entity145 , was then leading the investigation of the @entity148 kidnap case , which ended with the arrest and 1936 execution of @entity152 - born carpenter @entity151 for stealing and murdering the famed aviator 's infant son			1
the elder @entity3 was named @entity155 , but when the son was asked what his ' h '' stood for , he would reply , ' @entity159 ' although reputed to be short - tempered with aides and subordinates , he was a friendly , talkative and even jovial figure who did n't like ' @entity3 ' and preferred to be known as ' the @entity164 , ' a sobriquet given him by troops			1
activist : @entity168 , seen here in 2006 , largely faded from public life after his retirement from the @entity51			0
in recent years he became spokesmen for the @entity173 and an initiative to fund prostate cancer research public face : @entity3 gave numerous media briefings that aired across the country - making him a nationally - recognized name decorated : @entity3 was honored by president @entity43 , @entity45 , @entity47 and the governments of nearly every coalition nation where he served he also was outspoken at times , including when he described gen @entity183 , the @entity5 commander in @entity23 , as ' a horse 's ass ' in an @entity2 interview			1
as a teenager @entity3 accompanied his father to @entity188 , where the elder @entity3 trained the country 's national police force and was an adviser to @entity192 , the young @entity193			1
@entity194 studied there and in @entity196 , @entity152 and @entity197 , then followed in his father 's footsteps to @entity200 , graduating in 1956 with an engineering degree			0
after stints in the @entity5 and abroad , he earned a master 's degree in engineering at the @entity206 and later taught missile engineering at @entity200			0
in 1966 he volunteered for @entity23 and served two tours , first as a @entity5 adviser to @entity211 paratroops and later as a battalion commander in the @entity51 's @entity213			2
he earned three @entity214 for valor - including one for saving troops from a minefield - plus a @entity217 , a @entity218 and three @entity219			0
while many career officers left military service embittered by @entity23 , @entity3 was among those who opted to stay and help rebuild the tattered @entity51 into a potent , modernized all - volunteer force			1
after @entity7 invaded @entity8 in august 1990 , @entity3 played a key diplomatic role by helping to persuade @entity38 's @entity224 to allow @entity5 and other foreign troops to deploy on @entity38 territory as a staging area for the war to come			1
president @entity231 : ' with the passing of gen. @entity3 , we 've lost an @entity5 original			1
from his decorated service in @entity23 to the historic liberation of @entity8 and his leadership of @entity59 , gen. @entity3 stood tall for the country and @entity51 he loved			1
our prayers are with the @entity3 family , who tonight can know that his legacy will endure in a nation that is more secure because of his patriotic service			2
' _ _ _ former president @entity43 : ' @entity244 and i mourn the loss of a true @entity5 patriot and one of the great military leaders of his generation			0
a distinguished member of that " @entity252 " hailing from @entity200 , gen @entity253 , to me , epitomized the " duty , service , country " creed that has defended our freedom and seen this great nation through our most trying international crises			0
more than that , he was a good and decent man - and a dear friend			0
@entity244 and i send our condolences to his wife , @entity265 , and his wonderful family			0
' _ _ _ former secretary of state @entity116 : ' with the passing of general h. @entity3 , @entity5 lost a great patriot and a great soldier			1
@entity253 served his country with courage and distinction for over 35 years			0
the highlight of his career was the 1991 @entity29 , @entity29			2
" @entity3 " led the coalition forces to victory , ejecting the @entity278 from @entity8 and restoring the rightful government			2
his leadership not only inspired his troops , but also inspired the nation			0
he was a good friend of mine , a close buddy			0
my wife , @entity286 , joins me in extending our deepest condolences to his wife , @entity265 , and to her family			0
' on january 17 , 1991 , a five - month buildup called @entity292 became @entity29 as allied aircraft attacked @entity28 bases and @entity296 government facilities			1
the six - week aerial campaign climaxed with a massive ground offensive on february 24 through 28 , routing the @entity28 from @entity8 in 100 hours before @entity5 officials called a halt			0
@entity3 said afterward he agreed with @entity43 's decision to stop the war rather than drive to @entity296 to capture @entity7 , as his mission had been only to oust the @entity28 from @entity8			2
but in a desert tent meeting with vanquished @entity28 generals , he allowed a key concession on @entity28 's use of helicopters , which later backfired by enabling @entity7 to crack down more easily on rebellious @entity108 and @entity106			0
while he later avoided the public second - guessing by academics and think tank experts over the ambiguous outcome of @entity29 and its impact on @entity316 , he told the @entity97 in 2003 , ' you ca n't help but ... with 20/20 hindsight , go back and say , " look , had we done something different , we probably would n't be facing what we are facing today			1
" ' after retiring from the @entity51 in 1992 , @entity3 wrote a best - selling autobiography , ' it does n't take a hero			1
# of his @entity323 war role , he said , ' i like to say i 'm not a hero			0
i was lucky enough to lead a very successful war			0
' he was knighted by @entity47 and honored with decorations from @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity8 , @entity38 , @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity85			0
@entity3 was a national spokesman for prostate cancer awareness and for @entity333 , served on the @entity173 board of governors and was active in various charities for chronically ill children			2
' i may have made my reputation as a general in the @entity51 and i 'm very proud of that , ' he once told the @entity2 ' but i 've always felt that i was more than one - dimensional			2
i 'd like to think i 'm a caring human being			0
... it 's nice to feel that you have a purpose			0
' @entity3 and his wife , @entity265 , had three children : @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347 .			2
