by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 10:43 pm on 21st december 2011 the judge behind a ‘ whitewash ’ review of extradition has admitted he had not met @entity6 , the @entity8 ’s sufferer who faces being sent to the @entity10 for trial on hacking charges			1
lord justice @entity13 told @entity14 that while preparing his report into the treaty between @entity17 and the @entity10 he did not speak to mr @entity6 , his mother @entity18 , his legal team or any other suspects facing extradition to @entity10			1
instead , the former high court judge travelled to the @entity10 to spend a week with prosecutors involved in extradition cases			2
lord justice @entity13 ( left ) did not speak to @entity6 ( right ) while preparing his reporting on an extradition treaty under which @entity6 could be sent to the @entity10 for allegedly hacking into @entity28 and @entity29 computers mps passed a motion this month for ‘ urgent reform ’ of the treaty			1
critics say it is biased in favour of @entity10 , which requires stronger evidence than the @entity17 for the extradition of its citizens			2
lord justice @entity13 but the @entity13 review rejected that charge , and found there was no significant difference in the legal protection available in the two countries			2
he defended his review on tuesday before mps on the @entity49			2
he insisted that not a single @entity50 sent to the @entity10 would have escaped extradition if the wording of the treaty had been the same in both countries			0
but chairman @entity55 asked why he had not spoken to @entity17 citizens affected by the treaty , such as mr @entity6 – the subject of the @entity58 to @entity17 justice campaign – @entity61 or @entity62			1
mr @entity6 , who is autistic , admits hacking into @entity29 and @entity28 computers to look for evidence of ‘ little green men ’			1
mr @entity61 was one of the ‘ @entity66 ’ charged with fraud in the @entity10 in 2002 , extradited there in 2006 and sentenced to 37 months in jail in 2010			0
he has since been released			0
@entity62 , 37 , of @entity70 , @entity71 , was arrested under a @entity10 extradition request in 2004 on suspicion of supporting terrorism and has been detained without charge in a @entity17 jail ever since			0
mr @entity55 said : ‘ as part of your review you did n’t actually meet @entity80 or any representatives of the @entity62 case			0
@entity83 has been leading the fight to stop her son @entity6 from being extradited to the @entity10 ‘ so although you managed to go to @entity87 for a week you were n’t able to call in people like @entity61 , you were n’t able to call in the @entity6 team , you were n’t able to call in @entity62 ’s team			1
’ but lord justice @entity13 said he had received written evidence from mr @entity6 ’s lawyers			1
‘ @entity80 sent reams of material in , and the suggestion that we do n’t understand the plight of persons sought to be extradited is , i ’m afraid , not accepted , ’ he added			2
' he definitely should have heard from us and i would have told him how completely unfair and unequal the @entity100 is ' @entity83 , @entity6 's mother he said the review did not look at individual cases , but extradition in general , adding : ‘ they were all invited to give evidence in writing and many did			1
if there were issues we wanted to explore further and we thought we could get assistance , we did			0
’ mr @entity55 said it must have been a ‘ disappointment ’ that senior @entity113 politicians had rejected his findings after deputy prime minister @entity115 responded to the report by commissioning his own and attorney general @entity117 said the recommendations were just ‘ guidelines ’			0
however , lord justice @entity13 said : ‘ i do n’t have any disappointment			0
i simply produced a report and it ’s up to the politicians to do what they want with it			0
we think our recommendations are right			0
’ last night mr @entity6 ’s mother @entity83 said : ‘ he definitely should have heard from us			1
‘ i would have told him how completely unfair and unequal the treaty is , how this has totally destroyed @entity6 , totally destroyed our family			1
‘ but i think it would have fallen on deaf ears			0
@entity13 ’s report was a whitewash and i think he was completely blinkered			0
why should we need the @entity10 ’ input ? ‘ it ’s ludicrous that he even went to @entity87 to speak to their officials because they have already made up their minds about @entity6			1

@entity6 's defence team sent ' a great deal of material ' for him to read
