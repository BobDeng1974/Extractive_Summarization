by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has exerted his famous authority at @entity4 already by obtaining assurances that the club do not embark on another big pre-season tour next summer			1
the new @entity4 manager spoke in @entity10 ahead of the opening @entity12 tour game against @entity13 at the @entity15 @entity14			1
and it soon became clear that the @entity18 coach does not consider these tours adequate preparation for the @entity22 season			1
we have to prepare the season and when you have commercial activities and dreadful distances , having to fly a lot and the jet lag , it is not very positive for a good preparation			1
' the tour was already arranged and i shall adapt and @entity4 will do everything to apply to my rules , but i have said that already			1
' @entity24 hinted at issues with the commercial activity that is part of life at @entity53 when he spoke to the media in @entity56 last week			2
chief executive @entity57 has since played that down but @entity24 has now returned to the theme , suggesting that next summer things will be different			2
' yes , i hope that ( it will be shorter ) , ' he added			0
' but the club have already said that to me and i am very confident that it shall be			0
' welcome : united fans pack into @entity14 to watch their heroes train ahead of their game against @entity13 @entity24 ’s comments will certainly be viewed with interest by the @entity4 board given that it is the club ’s vast commercial reach that has sustained it through the controversial years of @entity73 ownership			1
the current tour is n’t even that big by @entity4 ’s standards			1
last summer , for example , @entity4 were away for three weeks and flew vast distances between @entity56 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
during this morning ’s press conference at a stadium it took @entity24 and his players two hours to reach from their hotel in @entity87 , the 62 - year - old gave firm backing to the players he has inherited from @entity91 and insisted he will not buy anyone else until he has assessed his squad properly			2
stretch : @entity95 and his @entity4 team - mates loosen up during training helping hand : @entity4 players stretch during their training session in @entity15 ovation : fans cheer on the @entity4 players as they arrive on pitch for a training session he added : ' at this moment , i can not say anything about the squad and additions			1
' i want to learn about my players and get to know them			0
when i am the coach and when i give the orders to my players to play a certain way , i want to see how they perform			0
' that is why i can not answer this question just now			0
i want to give all players the chance to show themselves under my guidance			0
' i have to say that the players ’ response to me so far has been fantastic			0
maybe you think every trainer coach will say that when they are new , but i mean it			0
' the players are very anxious to do what i say and follow the instructions of my assistants			0
' the focus of what i have seen in training sessions is top level , but we have to see if the performances are also top level			0
' on the ball : @entity24 takes charge of a training session at the @entity14 in @entity10 in his ear : @entity28 talks to striker @entity31 during the training session			2
