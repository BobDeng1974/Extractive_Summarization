by @entity0 published : 06:29 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 06:37 est , 21 february 2013 new details : secret documents have revealed that @entity3 gave money to children and claimed it back on @entity7 expenses @entity3 made several secret payments to children at the height of his offending and managed to claim the cash back from the @entity7 as expenses , it was revealed today			1
confidential documents show the paedophile handed £ 10 to three youngsters in 1974 - worth around £ 72 today - after they had appeared on his @entity19 tv show			1
@entity3 , who was being paid the huge sum of £ 2,350 for every show he presented , demanded the money back and the corporation obliged and never asked why he paid the children			1
a letter , dated april 18 1974 , shows the transactions and has today been released by the @entity7 under the @entity27			1
' we understand from @entity30 that during the above programme [ @entity19 ] you dispersed £ 10 each to the following young people [ names blanked out ] , ' it says			1
' we therefore enclose our cheque for £ 30 to reimburse you			2
' the payments were during the peak period of his predatory attacks , between 1966 and 1976 , when he was aged between 40 and 50			2
in 1974 alone there were 30 occasions where he allegedly sexually abused both children and adults			1
since october there have been 450 complaints to police about him - 214 have been recorded as crimes			0
his earliest offence was in @entity53 in 1955 , and the final reported allegation was in 2009 when he was aged 82			0
some were allegedly attacked on @entity7 premises , including in his dressing room and the caravan he kept in the @entity60 car park in @entity30			2
concerns : @entity3 paid the youngsters in 1974 , during his most prolific period of abuse , when he allegedly attacked people at @entity60 ( pictured ) but despite abusing all over @entity66 he was never brought to justice even though police had chances to prosecute him while the @entity70 was alive			1
yesterday it was revealed an officer from @entity73 is to be investigated after being accused of contacting @entity74 on the @entity70 's behalf before they interviewed @entity3 over three alleged sex crimes in 2009			0
the reasons for these new secret payments to @entity19 children are a mystery , but the @entity7 maintains there is no evidence that the youngsters were victims			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman told @entity84 : ' the document shows @entity3 was reimbursed the sum of £ 30 but there are no further details about this transaction which took place over 40 years ago '			1
show : sir @entity3 is shown presenting his programme ' @entity19 ' alongside guest @entity92			2
it is not known which children @entity3 paid nearly 40 years ago but the solicitor representing victims said the cash could be something more worrying			0
' the payments could be deeply sinister , or it could just be that @entity3 was tight , ' @entity99 from the @entity101 law firm told the @entity104			0
' we know he met kids in cafes and perhaps bought them drinks , but i ca n’t think why he would want to reimburse himself			0
' it is well known he was reportedly tight - fisted , but given what we have learned over the past few months , one has got to keep an open mind about this			0
' the foi shows other expenses claims he made when he was at @entity116			0
it appears he demanded a new suit for every show he presented and asked for , and was given , an £ 1,800 pay rise per show in 1990 to allow for inflation - a huge sum at the time			2
he also asked for £ 200 travelling expenses for every programme because he lived in northern @entity127 , not @entity30			0
a memo in 1989 said : ' perhaps predictably @entity3 has raised the question of expenses using the argument that although he maintains a flat in @entity30 , he is now principally resident in @entity133			0

@entity70 gave £ 10 each - £ 72 today - to 3 young people on his @entity19 show
letter from @entity7 in 1974 confirms they reimbursed him for the payments
corporation says no evidence the *unnamed* children were @entity145 victims
but 1974 was during his most prolific period - a year where he abused 30
