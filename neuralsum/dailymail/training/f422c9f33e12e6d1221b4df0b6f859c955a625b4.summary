it has a long and hallowed history within @entity3 political tradition , but is anyone better at having their photograph taken with children and babies than @entity9 ? indeed , a fresh batch of pictures taken over the summer and released by the @entity12 this week leave no doubt that when it comes to that all important clinch with the kids , no one comes close to the current commander in chief			1
mainly taken in and around the @entity12 , the photographs with the children reveal the president at arguably his most natural and comfortable , hardly surprising given the stresses and strains as the leader of the free world			2
from a little boy who has face - planted himself into one of the @entity28 sofa 's while his @entity31 agent father departs the president 's security detail , to golfer @entity35 's smiling daughter , @entity34 , the joyous pictures lay bare @entity9 's softer side			1
so sure is his touch in front of the camera with youngsters that it cuts a stark contrast with sunday 's claim from the president that the theater of the presidency does not come naturally to him			0
but each of the children seem to be enamoured with the president and he equally seems to relish the time with them , away from the critical daily decision making at the @entity12			0
