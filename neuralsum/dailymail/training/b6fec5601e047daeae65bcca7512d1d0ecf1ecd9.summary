just 39 per cent of youth in @entity32 and 28 per cent in @entity34 were classed as heavy drinkers			0
it was n't all bad news for @entity16 though : @entity41 ate considerably more fruit and vegetables than the average @entity44 ; they had more green spaces to enjoy , and ate breakfast more frequently than their @entity6 counterparts			1

the urban poor are now worse off than the rural poor			0
' health inequalities are a greater issue than ever before and it 's becoming increasingly important for policymakers to take the valuable information that we have to offer and translate into policies that can help improve our health			0
' by highlighting these differences , we can learn from each other to make our cities healthier , and empower the citizens of @entity6			0
' dr @entity121 , from the @entity122 , added : ' policy makers and researchers need to work together , with the best evidence , to reduce inequalities and improve health			0
