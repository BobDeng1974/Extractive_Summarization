six of the countries listed in the top 10 ranking were @entity18			0
the study , spearheaded by sir @entity20 -- the @entity22 computer scientist credited with inventing the world wide web in 1989 , is considered a ground - breaking look not only at the technology of the web but also measuring how well a country is allowing its citizens to share information online and ultimately impact society			1
world wide web : @entity11 was number on the list , with the @entity2 at # 2 and the @entity13 third commissioned by the @entity36 , the index looked at 61 developed and developing nations , offering the ' first multidimensional measure of the @entity36 's growth , utility and impact			1
' with its number one spot , @entity11 was found to have the greatest infrastructure to allow citizens to connect to the @entity10 ( with a score of 96.76 )			2
the @entity2 on the other hand was at the top in allowing full access to web content but the availability of the web remained out of reach to some citizens , below its @entity55 counterpart			1
' the @entity2 has a lower percentage of households with personal computers than a raft of countries , including @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , ' according to the study			2
ground - breaking : the study has been praised as the ' first multidimensional measure of the @entity36 's growth , utility and impact ' the @entity2 was also found to be sluggish in terms of internet speed and ' offers slower bandwidth per internet user than a range of countries , most notably @entity77 , @entity11 and @entity78			1
' while significant usage was reported in the @entity80 , the @entity10 remains out of reach to many living in the developing world			0

he claims there is no ' kill switch ' for the internet @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 were the bottom three of 61 countries measured using indicators such as the political , economic and social impact of the web , connectivity and use			1
' the high price of connectivity is stopping billions of people from achieving their rights to knowledge and participation			0
costs have got to come down dramatically , ' @entity20 said about the disparity in the availability of internet access			0
@entity11 is the best country at using the internet , the new report spearheaded by @entity20 found			1

called the @entity120 , the first - of - its - kind report ranked 61 countries across seven categories , including communications infrastructure , web use , web content and the political , social and economic impact of the internet in those countries			1

growing suppression of free speech , both online and offline , is possibly the single biggest challenge to the future of the @entity90 , ' he added			0
@entity20 has publicly denied the web comes with a kill switch , in response to fears governments all over the world could coordinate to make it a centralized system - particularly after the reliance of activists on the internet during the @entity151 uprising			2
' the way the internet is designed is very much as a decentralized system , ' the 57 - year - old computer scientist said , in speaking about his ground breaking research at the study 's release in @entity160 on wednesday at the @entity161 in central @entity160			0
it was this big : web inventor sir @entity20 talks at the launch of the @entity93 at the @entity161 in @entity160			0
' at the moment , because countries connect to each other in lots of different ways , there is no one off switch , there is no central place where you can turn it off			0
' ' in order to be able to turn the whole thing off or really block , suppress one particular idea then the countries and governments would have to get together and agree and co-ordinate and turn it from a decentralised system to being a centralized system			0
