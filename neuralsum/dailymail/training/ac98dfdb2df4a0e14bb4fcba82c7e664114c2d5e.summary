by @entity0 a @entity2 bomb killed two construction site workers when it exploded 100 years after being fired at a @entity6 battlefield			1
the bomb had laid dormant for a century at an industrial site in the former area of @entity11 battlegrounds , killing two and injuring two more			0
@entity13 of the @entity15 prosecutor 's office confirmed that the armament from the 1914 - 1918 war exploded near the workers , but did not say whether it was a shell or a grenade			0
emergency personnel remove evidence near a covered body after a @entity2 armament exploded in @entity15 , @entity25 it was not confirmed whether the bomb was a grenade or a shell , but it has been confirmed that it killed two and injured two more the circumstances were unclear because there was apparently no digging at the site - the usual cause of such accidents every year the battlefields in western @entity25 throw up hundreds of armaments from the @entity2 , and most are destroyed without incident by a special @entity6 army bomb squad			1
in a nearby city , the army was completing the destruction of over 800 gas canisters			0
more and more unexploded shells are discovered every year in the areas in and around the former @entity11 field battleground evacuation works are the common cause of exploding the dormant shells , as the heavy machinery used in the process can jostle the delicate armaments back to life , although this case was peculiar because no digging took place the @entity11 battlefields cover dozens of cities where allies clashed with @entity62 forces for most of the war			2
earlier this year , members of the bomb disposal unit managed to disarm an unexploded shell at a construction site in @entity15 , @entity25			0
also earlier this month , a large amount of ammunition from the @entity2 was discovered on the border of the @entity72 municipalities of @entity73 and @entity74 , for which the @entity6 bomb squad is still working to clean up the site earlier this month members of the bomb disposal unit in @entity15 , @entity25 , were lucky as they managed to evacuate and disarm a wwi - era bomb before it exploded the unexploded bomb from january 2014 was found during similar evacuation works to the ones that caused a bomb to explode this month			1

armament was *disturbed* and exploded evacuation works at the site
killed two and injured two , all construction workers working in the area
this area of @entity25 is rife with unexploded bombs from the @entity2
