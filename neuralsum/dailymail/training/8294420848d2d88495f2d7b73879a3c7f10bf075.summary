the remaining passengers have now been allowed to leave after being forced to stay on the plane then wait in immigration			2
one man - who got through customs and almost out of the airport before officials changed their minds and told him to stay - spoke of the confused response from the airport and health officials which left him and his fellow passengers in the dark			1
despite reports claiming the passenger was found to be noncontagious after initial examinations , the @entity8 and @entity84 @entity106 told @entity110 the passenger was not cleared at the airport and has since been taken to hospital			2
he has since been seen arriving at @entity38 in a wheelchair wearing protective overalls , gloves and a surgical mask			0
the man is believed to have flown from @entity5 via @entity67 , @entity68 - the same route taken by @entity119 , the first person to be diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity44			1
@entity77 's condition has today been classed as ' critical ' as he is treated for the disease in @entity122 , @entity76			0
ten people linked to him have been classed as ' high risk '			0
today 's possible case brought chaos and confusion to the airport - to the bewilderment of waiting passengers , who were not told about that the emergency was linked to @entity3 for more than an hour			1
@entity133 , a passenger on the flight who was sitting close to the potential @entity3 victim , told how the man 's face was covered with a mask and he was rushed to the back of the plane when flight attendants found he came from @entity5			1
he said : ' once they found out he was from @entity5 they put a mask on him and his daughter , then they got him out of his seat and took him to somewhere at the back of the plane			2
' mr @entity133 , who said he was ' very nervous ' for his own health when he heard there was a risk of @entity3 risk , told @entity154 that he was moved away from the area into another part of the plane after the man had been taken away			1
he added that he did not see the man vomit while on board the plane - though officials were clear that this did occur at some point			1
mr @entity133 characterized the airport response as chaotic , adding that it raised questions about how a more contagious disease could be handled			0
he said the situation was ' very uncoordinated inside the airport			0
lots of people were giving directions - sometimes they were conflicting '			0
an official statement from airport authorities referred only to an ' ill customer '			0
quarantined : ten people have been assessed as ' high risk ' and evacuated for @entity177 to sanitize the area it said : ' upon arrival at @entity7 from @entity67 , medical professionals instructed that customers and crew of @entity72 flight 988 remain on board until they could assist an ill customer			1
' ' we are working with authorities and will accommodate our customers as quickly as we can			0
' @entity33 passenger @entity32 tweeted a picture of immigration officials on board the plane , adding : ' drama on the flight from @entity197 , pax taken off by @entity65 , we are stuck on the plane , @entity200 staff now on ! ' the 261 passengers were then handed leaflets titled , ' possible exposure : @entity3			1
what you need to do '			0
it read : ' you are being given this card because a sick person who might have been exposed to @entity3 sat near you on a plane or had contact with you in an airport			1
' @entity212 on a plane or in an airport is not likely			0
however , @entity65 is being extra careful to ensure you safety			0
' in the next few days , a public health official will let you know if the sick person has @entity3 or not			2
' if the person has @entity3 , you will be evaluated and given additional instructions			2
' if the person does not have @entity3 , no further action is needed			2
' it goes on to explain that ' @entity3 is a severe , often fatal disease that spreads through direct contact with an infected person '			2
at the bottom of the leaflet there is a note for passengers to hand to their doctors , explaining the situation and advising that they be examined			0
the incident comes just a day after the government conceded that its handling of the crisis has so far been ' rocky ' as @entity77 is treated for the disease in @entity76 and 10 people are now classed as ' high risk '			0
the handling of the @entity122 case in the early stages of @entity77 's illness has raised questions about how prepared local and national health officials were to handle that case and whether people were unnecessarily exposed			2
dr @entity247 , a director at the @entity248 , insisted to reporters at the @entity250 that although it ' may be entirely conceivable ' that there would be another @entity3 case in the @entity44 , the strength of the healthcare infrastructure ' would make it extraordinarily unlikely that we would have an outbreak			2
' authorities have narrowed their focus to about 50 people who had direct or indirect contact with the infected @entity5 visitor , including 10 at high risk who are being checked twice daily for symptoms			0
dr @entity247 said contact tracing is ' now ' going on , five days after @entity77 was hospitalized			0
officials were asked at a news conference why the patient was able to get past screening in his journey from @entity5 on september 19 and then be sent home after telling a @entity122 hospital a few days later about his travel to a country where there had been an @entity3 outbreak			1
the case has put authorities and the public on alert over concerns that the worst epidemic of @entity3 on record could spread from @entity43 , where it began in march			1
the @entity286 on friday updated its death toll to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected , probable and confirmed cases			0
the epidemic has hit hardest in impoverished @entity5 , @entity290 and @entity291			0
at friday 's news conference , @entity250 adviser @entity292 was asked whether she would recommend to president @entity294 that he impose a travel ban on @entity43 , as some public officials have called for			0
' right now we believe those types of steps actually impede the response , ' @entity292 said .			0
