in limbo : @entity19 , center , poses with his grandparents @entity23 and @entity25 at their home in the outskirts of @entity28 , where the @entity1 junior has been living since the summer because the @entity3 government has barred him from returning home son 's duty : @entity9 , left , accompanied his undocumented mother , @entity34 , right , to a clinic in @entity6 in a last - ditch effort to find a treatment for her terminal cancer the @entity1 junior was faced with an impossible choice this summer : his mother 's life or his immigration status			1
@entity9 was brought to the @entity3 as a toddler by his undocumented parents , and was desperate to find a treatment for his terminally ill mother that he decided to take her to a clinic in @entity6 without waiting for permission from @entity3 immigration officials			1
for @entity34 , @entity9 's mother , the chemotherapy stopped working last spring , as did the radiation			1
doctors had already removed one of her kidneys			0
so her son did what any computer - savvy kid might do for a dying parent — he searched online and jumped into action			2
@entity19 found clinics offering alternative treatments in @entity6 and took his mother across the border , hoping to keep her alive			1
in an immigration system where even the smallest mistake can bring dire consequences , @entity19 knowingly broke a rule by leaving the @entity3 without federal authorization			2
his dad and mom wanted him to go , and he did the best thing he thought he could do for his family , ' said his lawyer @entity18			2
@entity19 had lived in the @entity3 illegally since he was 2			0
his parents brought him from @entity28 to @entity76 , and they overstayed tourist visas			1
he breezed through school , earning a scholarship to a @entity81 summer school program at 13			0
eventually , along with hundreds of thousands of other young immigrants , he was granted a temporary reprieve from the threat of deportation under a 2012 @entity87 administration order			0
the catch : if these immigrants ever leave the @entity3 without government approval , they lose their protected status			1
@entity19 was at his mother 's side when she died weeks later			0

@entity19 did not know he could expedite his request , according to mr @entity18 , so when he had not heard from immigration by @entity139 , he decided to go to @entity6 anyway			1
' my mom had a lot of ups and downs , ' @entity9 told the @entity145			2
' the decision to actually leave was made overnight			0
' his lawyer , @entity18 , told @entity112 : ‘ he did what he had to do to take care of his family , ’ said the lawyer , adding that as an undocumented immigrant , @entity9 ’s mother did not have access to top - notch medical care in the @entity3			1
‘ this young man is a hero , ’ @entity18 said			0
‘ this kid is everything we want from someone who wants to come to the @entity3 … he is the reason why we have the @entity164			0
’ tale as old as time : @entity9 's parents , pictured with him as a boy , emigrated to the @entity3 when he was 2 and only told him they were undocumented when he started taking college courses any immigrants with pending cases need permission to go abroad , which is not difficult to get eventually , if their requests are deemed valid			1
but those who do not wait for sometimes slow responses are considered to have voluntarily given up their effort to remain in the @entity3			0
advocates say it should be easier for immigrants who have lived in the @entity3 for many years to get permission to travel			1
but no such provisions were included in last year 's immigration reform bills , and they are n't expected to be included in any executive action president @entity87 might announce later this year			0

@entity19 's 16 - year - old brother also was by her side			0
as a @entity3 - born citizen , he is allowed to travel freely			1
their father , a building contractor in the @entity3 illegally , stayed behind at the family 's @entity123 home with their 9 - year - old sister			2
@entity19 says he regrets his rash decision most of all because he thinks his mother would have been happier living her final days in @entity76 with her husband and children , ' but then we still had hope — and if we delayed that treatment any longer because of immigration issues , i do n't think i would have been able to forgive myself			0
' @entity19 's parents had kept his immigration status secret for years			2
they came clean only when he began taking community - college engineering classes while still in high school , and the social security number his parents submitted bounced back			2
before her death , @entity19 's mom opened up about the past and her reasons for leaving @entity6 : her father had been kidnapped twice ; her father - in - law and other relatives faced extortion ; armed thieves broke into her clothing and jewelry store , holding a knife to her stomach			2
@entity19 recorded her stories and her struggle with kidney cancer , hoping to turn it into a documentary back at school			0
instead , he 's passing time in a room next to a garage just big enough to fit his twin bed and bureau			0
a picture of his mother and a single rose hang above the bed			0
his grandparents rent out the nearest bathroom during weekends for a pop - up street market			0
@entity19 sees his cousins after they get off work , and ' writes poetry and stuff ' at night			0

' @entity19 tackled homelessness in a student film , and later co-produced @entity257 - a documentary about other immigrants like himself at @entity1			1
impossible choice : @entity19 could have waited for a special authorization to travel abroad with his mother , but the process was taking a long time - the one thing his dying parent did not have all in vain : mrs @entity34 , seen in a picture behind @entity9 , passed away in august , and when her son tried to re-enter the @entity3 , he was turned back ' he 's as @entity3 as anyone i know , ' @entity247 said			1
' the law needs to sort of recognize that and have a mechanism for accounting for that ... for the law not to be able to handle his kind of case is hurting @entity3			0
' @entity9 's harrowing tale has drawn media attention on both sides of the @entity3 - @entity6 border			1
the spanish - language @entity281 aired a segment about the @entity1 student 's ordeal , which included an emotional interview with the @entity1 junior			2
@entity19 says it 's been liberating to have no term - paper deadlines to worry about , but the lack of a routine keeps him edgy			0
he watches his back when he ventures outside			0
cartels have moved in , extorting neighborhood businesses			0
weeks ago , a relative was mugged and shot in the stomach			0
@entity1 has been supportive , granting him leave and helping him find sympathetic ears in @entity300 , including sen. @entity301 , an @entity303 @entity302			0
@entity19 now talks about when he 'll return , not if			2
but when asked what 's hardest about being stuck in @entity6 , he loses his bravado and his voice drops to a whisper : ' that i do n't have a mom anymore			2
' asked about what might happen to @entity9 upon his return to the @entity3 , @entity18 said he does not believe the high - achieving student with a spotless record and a baby on the way would face deportation , especially with congressional midterm elections right around the corner			1
