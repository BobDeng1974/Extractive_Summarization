on the evening of august 26 , 2013 , a group of @entity2 cricketers walked on to the @entity4 pitch and sat together in the gathering twilight			1
they had won the series and retained the @entity8 , now they drank champagne in celebration of their triumph			2
a number of players climbed to their feet and , one by one , proceeded to urinate on the wicket , while colleagues cheered in laddish approval			2
over in the @entity22 , a few @entity21 cricket writers were putting the last , sombre touches to their test match reports			2
they looked up , realised what was happening out in the middle and gleefully began a whole new story			2
the incident was scarcely earth - shattering , indeed , there were those who excused it as no more than ‘ high spirits ’			1
yet it was undeniably crass and arrogantly disrespectful and , for some , it crystallised lurking misgivings about the @entity37 side			2
they were richly talented , hugely successful but too often they lacked the style , the class , the charm we seek in the best of our sportsmen			2
as such , they were widely celebrated but sadly unloved			2
we can think of any number of unappealing figures who became national treasures simply by beating @entity53 at cricket			2
but never has a team of proven winners attracted so many reservations among those who were desperate to celebrate their achievements			2
of course , there was a nucleus of quietly impressive individuals			2
the successive captains , @entity78 and @entity79 , spring swiftly to mind , as do the likes of @entity82 and poor @entity83			0
but others seemed rather less engaging			0
there was @entity86 , a fine spinner , desperate to be recognised as a ‘ character ’			0
@entity86 , or ‘ @entity88 ’ , as he much prefers to be called , deserted @entity90 cricket when @entity37 were 3 - 0 down in an @entity8 series in @entity53			1
there was @entity86 ’s chippy chum @entity94 , whose wearisome barking was a discordant sound of an @entity2 summer			0
and there was @entity98 , a notably preening , pouting presence in a team which had its share of preening pouters			0
which leads us , quite naturally , to @entity47			1
one imagines that the past few days have been some of the happiest of his life			0
in recent months , he has been obliged to rely on the efforts of minor showbiz mediocrities to keep his name in the headlines			1
but now everybody , but everybody , has been talking about him ! and all it took was one spectacularly dreadful book			1
@entity116 , vindictive , petulant , insufferably conceited and remorselessly self - justifying , @entity47 ’s autobiography is a study in paranoia			1
jealousy is everywhere , resentment is rampant , the world is conspiring to do down @entity47			1
but will @entity47 be done down ? he will not			1
and all of those enemies and ingrates , from @entity78 to @entity126 , to most of the @entity37 bowlers , to all of the cricket media ; well , now they know that @entity47 is not a man to cross			1
@entity47 has spent the week shamelessly self - promoting his dreadful new book one victim of @entity47 's literary attacks is his former coach @entity126 ( left ) his lack of awareness is astonishing			1
last week , speaking to the today programme on @entity136 , he was asked if there was anything he might have done differently			1
‘ absolutely ’ , he said			0
‘ i think my biggest single flaw is that i ’m too honest , too much of a straight talker			0
’ it was gauche beyond parody			0
a man with even a shred of self - awareness could not have uttered that line			1
yet @entity47 had clearly rehearsed it			1
in truth , the entire interview was studded with unconscious gems , but the following passage rang a familiar bell : ‘ when i did get sacked , a lot of the youngsters who are in the team at the moment sent me messages saying , “ i ’m really sorry			0
thank you so much for all your help ”			0
i get messages when the team are playing against @entity156 saying , “ how am i going to play this guy ? what should i do in this situation ? ”			0
’ then i recalled these words of another wickedly maligned titan : ‘ you ’ve seen how i react to people , make them feel good , make them think that anything ’s possible			0
and i do n’t do it so they turn round and go , “ thank you @entity174 for the opportunity , thank you for the wisdom , thank you for the laughs ”			0
i do it so , one day , someone will go , “ there goes @entity181			1
i must remember to thank him ”			0
’ @entity47 had to pack his bags in february , when he was sacked by the @entity183 @entity47 takes a snap of the @entity8 urn ( left ) , and looks downbeat during an @entity37 training session ( right ) @entity181 and @entity47 have a good deal in common			1
like @entity47 , @entity181 would have shaken off the dust of counties and nations with scarcely a second thought			1
like @entity193 , he would have cast himself as perpetual victim			0
and , like @entity193 , he would have listened only to courtiers and sycophants while ignoring sane , intelligent men of cricket who were offering more prudent counsel			0
and yet , we must curse the wanton waste			0
at a time when @entity37 face an impossibly crowded year of international cricket , a great player has placed himself beyond the pale			0
the bloom of @entity47 ’s glittering talent has faded but he surely had more runs to plunder , more service to offer			1
he has gone and he will not be back			0
and how will posterity remember him ? i suspect @entity47 will be seen in the same light as the team he once adorned : richly talented , hugely successful and widely celebrated			1

@entity47 has spent the week shamelessly self - promoting his dreadful book , which has put his name in all the headlines
*previously* , he had to rely on minor showbiz mediocrities to keep his name in the news - but now , everyone has been talking about him
his interviews are rehearsed and his lack of awareness is astonishing
@entity47 is similar to @entity181 in the way he *deflects* any *wrongdoing* onto the shoulders of others
