they argue in a damning report from the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) that investment is needed to plug gaps in the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 created by the funding squeeze			1
the @entity8 's chief executive , commander @entity16 , branded the @entity3 a ' sacrificial lamb ' and ' @entity18 of the public services ' , and said the nation 's security is being ' severely compromised '			1
diminished : defence chiefs called for the investment in armed forces to plug gaps created by funding cuts the @entity28 's @entity3 report presents the views of all three services , having been co-authored by @entity31 , general sir @entity32 and air chief marshal sir @entity33			1
writing on the @entity12 , admiral @entity31 , @entity34 and @entity35 from 2002 to 2006 , said : ' the ability of our military to protect the nation from the shock of the unexpected has diminished to a perilous degree			2
' he added that the 2010 @entity43 was the ' final nail in the coffin ' and said the @entity12 was ' far from being as robust as the nation has a right to expect '			0
admiral @entity31 also called an increase in defence funding to the equivalent of 3 % of @entity51 , which he said was ' vital to the survival and wealth of our nation and people '			2
perilous : admiral @entity31 called for defence funding to increase to the equivalent of 3 % of gdp writing on the prospects for the @entity13 , general sir @entity32 , who commanded @entity62 forces in @entity63 , said the latest reductions in manpower and an over-reliance on the @entity13 ' could prove fatal '			1
the military is set to increase its reliance on reserves as the @entity70 is slashed by 20,000 , accompanying it by a doubling in the number of so - called weekend warriors to 30,000			0
he said : ' given the past run - down of the @entity13 including the closure of @entity13 centres , the reduction in man training days and lack of funding for recruitment campaigns , it is clearly not possible to increase the trained manpower of the @entity85 in time to compensate for regular soldiers being made redundant			0
' former head of the @entity14 air chief marshal sir @entity33 added his concerns for the future of the @entity14			0
whole capabilities are absent , such as maritime patrol and long range electronic reconnaissance , while the loss of the @entity95 fleet has left the nation with no sea - borne offensive air support , as well as a serious reduction in numbers of close air support aircraft vital in operations such as @entity102 or @entity103 , he said			0
he added : ' it is the matter of numbers which is the greatest challenge in the years ahead			0
' @entity107 matters , and all the @entity3 , the @entity12 and @entity14 in particular , will have to find a better balance between the demands of high tech warfare and the simple fact that quantity has a quality of its own ; it will require an honest recognition that without the @entity116 we are severely restricted in what we can actually achieve			2
' in his introduction to the report , @entity118 said : ' over the past two decades , defence has been the @entity18 of the public services			1
@entity123 : general sir @entity32 warned that over-reliance on the @entity13 ' could prove fatal ' ' whilst the share of public expenditure devoted to health and welfare has skyrocketed , the proportion granted to defence has shrunk			2
' defence has for far too long been a sacrificial lamb			1
the security of the @entity134 is being severely compromised by the continued swingeing cuts to our @entity3			1
' since its formation in 2007 the @entity8 has led the way in endeavouring to advise the people and politicians of this country of the risks and weaknesses that have been forced upon our @entity3			0
' these have been very clearly highlighted in the reports written by three very experienced and knowledgeable retired senior officers : for the @entity12 , admiral @entity149 ; for the @entity13 , general sir @entity32 ; and for the @entity14 , air chief marshal sir @entity33			0
