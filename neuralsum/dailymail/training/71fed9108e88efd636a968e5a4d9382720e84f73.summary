@entity0 last night claimed he had never seen the ‘ disastrous ’ leaked @entity2 document advising mps not to campaign on immigration			1
the @entity2 leader said he had ‘ no idea ’ who was responsible for the 33 - page paper , which suggested ‘ moving the conversation on ’ to issues such as pressures on the @entity12 and housing when voters raise it			1
but he risked more criticism when what had been billed as a major pre-election speech on @entity2 policy on immigration – which he forgot to mention in his party conference speech – lasted for less than seven minutes			1
it advised @entity26 not to send out campaign leaflets about immigration to all voters because it could prove ‘ unhelpful ’			1
party insiders blamed @entity38 , mr @entity0 ’s new election campaign chief , for allowing an internal strategy document to be issued to mps most at risk from @entity43 without it being checked by senior colleagues			1
the paper said immigration was the issue ‘ people most often cite ’ when explaining why they back @entity50 ’s party			1
it advised campaigners to ‘ understand and acknowledge ’ concerns even if they ‘ may not gel with their own ’			0
but it insisted @entity2 can not win a ‘ bidding war ’ with @entity43 , adding : ‘ our focus must instead be moving the conversation on to issues where we have clear policy which tackles the problems people are worried about			1
’ blame : party insiders put the blame for not seeking full approval at the door of @entity38 ( above ) senior mps were furious about the document , which had not been seen by shadow home secretary @entity70			1
one said it was ‘ disastrous ’ and blamed miss @entity38 , put in charge of the day - to - day running of @entity2 ’s election campaign despite being elected only in 2012			1
asked if he had seen the document before it was issued to mps , mr @entity0 said : ‘ no. i have no idea who oversaw the document			0
‘ there were bits that obviously were n’t well - drafted			0
’ in his less than seven - minute speech in @entity83 , @entity84 , the @entity2 leader said that if elected he would change the law to prevent firms exploiting legal loopholes to employ foreign workers on lower wages than their @entity91 counterparts			2
‘ it is n’t prejudiced to worry about immigration , it is understandable , ’ he added			0
he later told @entity95 that @entity2 candidates should not shy away from talking about immigration			1
‘ absolutely , they should talk to voters about it			0
of course you ’ve got to engage with people ’s concerns , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve learnt lessons since 2010			0
i ’ve changed @entity2 ’s approach on immigration			1
’ @entity109 ’s former spin doctor @entity108 said @entity2 ’s ‘ strategic ’ advisers should be beaten ‘ savagely around the head ’ with a rolled - up copy of the 33 - page paper			1
he said that such documents should not be ‘ done by people who do n’t have the sheer bloody common sense to realise how their words will sound if exposed publicly ’			0
@entity2 mp @entity118 , a critic of the leadership , said : ‘ this leaked document on how @entity2 should try to win back @entity43 voters shows lessons are still to be learned			1
’ but former @entity2 leadership contender @entity124 complained that the party was giving the impression it was ‘ running scared of @entity43 ’			1
she added : ‘ @entity2 can not magic immigrants off the streets without pulling out of the international conventions that commit us to accepting refugees and asylum seekers , or somehow nullifying the citizenship of existing @entity91 passport holders			2
’ @entity136 's analysis : weasel words that reveal what @entity138 thinks @entity0 yesterday claimed voters should be in ‘ no doubt ’ about how seriously @entity2 treats concerns over mass immigration			1
however a document sent to @entity26 and activists reveals that , in reality , the party would rather talk about almost anything else			1
here , @entity149 editor @entity136 examines the key paragraphs			0
what the document says : immigration is the issue people most often cite when explaining support for @entity43 , either their own or that of communities and electors more generally ... it does not however follow that campaigning on immigration issues and emphasising our policies in our conversations with electors is always the correct response			2
translation : @entity2 – for all the recent talk of crackdowns – continues to support large - scale immigration , particularly from within the @entity171			2
party chiefs know that , as a result , they can not win a bidding war with @entity43 so should , wherever possible , avoid the subject altogether – or risk losing seats			0
fightback : @entity0 took questions on immigration in a seven - minute speech in @entity83 yesterday what it says : writing to electors proactively ( i.e. without evidence the elector is concerned about it ) about immigration risks undermining the broad coalition of support we need to return to government			0
translation : do n’t prompt voters to think about immigration if they are not already doing so			0
leave the topic out of general mailshots			0
some @entity2 voters are supporters of mass immigration			2
why upset them with talk of tough new measures needed to win back potential defectors to @entity43 ? what it says : following from this , when we embark on policy messaging around immigration , which is not an area where @entity2 has the strongest lead over other parties , we should ensure that this messaging is always done in conjunction with other policy areas			1
the purpose of this is to raise the salience of those issues in which @entity2 has a much clearer lead and stands to benefit more from their prominence with the electorate			2
’ translation : if immigration does come up , change the topic as quickly as possible			0
if a voter talks about the pressure on the @entity12 or education , switch the focus to health care and schools more generally			0
what it says : volunteers and activists must understand and acknowledge electors ’ concerns about immigration on the doorstep , which will mean hearing opinions that may not gel with their own			0
in these cases , it ’s important to remember that first phase of re-establishing trust is to listen and understand			0
translation : a weasel - worded way of saying that , while @entity2 activists will not agree with some people ’s desire for stricter border controls , they must try not to sneer , and at least humour them			2
an insight into the way the modern @entity256 feels it may have to condescend to views it finds unpalatable			0
what it says : @entity43 ’s electoral success has come from disenfranchised backers of all three main parties including ‘ former @entity2 supporters who feel that the party has left them behind in pursuit of better - educated , middle - class , white collar voters ’			2
translation : during the @entity2 years , the party entirely neglected the concerns of ordinary voters , especially over immigration			1
now those chickens are coming home to roost and the party has to try to do something about it			2
the @entity277 and @entity278 by - election , where @entity43 came within 617 votes of snatching the seat , is proof of that .			0
