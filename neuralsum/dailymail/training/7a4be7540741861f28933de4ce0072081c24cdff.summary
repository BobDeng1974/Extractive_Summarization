they say silence is golden – but there ’s a room in the @entity4 that ’s so quiet it becomes unbearable after a short time			1
the longest that anyone has survived in the ‘ anechoic chamber ’ at @entity8 in @entity9 is just 45 minutes			1
it ’s 99.99 per cent sound absorbent and holds the @entity11 for the world ’s quietest place , but stay there too long and you may start hallucinating			1
@entity17 's quietest place : the ' anechoic chamber ' at @entity8 , which is 99.99 per cent sound absorbent and capable of giving you hallucinations the @entity20 at @entity8 was deemed the quietest place on @entity17 in 2004 - a record it still holds to this day it achieves its ultra-quietness by virtue of 3.3 - foot - thick fiberglass acoustic wedges , double walls of insulated steel and foot - thick concrete			1
the company ’s founder and president , @entity33 , told @entity34 : ‘ we challenge people to sit in the chamber in the dark - one reporter stayed in there for 45 minutes			1
‘ when it ’s quiet , ears will adapt			0
the quieter the room , the more things you hear			0
you 'll hear your heart beating , sometimes you can hear your lungs , hear your stomach gurgling loudly			0
‘ in the anechoic chamber , you become the sound			1
’ and this is a very disorientating experience			0
mr @entity33 explained that it ’s so disconcerting that sitting down is a must			0
he said : ‘ how you orient yourself is through sounds you hear when you walk			0
in the anechnoic chamber , you do n't have any cues			1
you take away the perceptual cues that allow you to balance and manoeuvre			0
if you 're in there for half an hour , you have to be in a chair			0
’ the chamber is used by a multitude of manufacturers , which test how loud their products are			1
mr @entity33 said : ‘ it 's used for formal product testing , for research into the sound of different things - heart valves , the sound of the display of a cellphone , the sound of a switch on a car dashboard			2
’ silence is not so golden : the longest anyone has lasted sitting alone in the dark in the chamber is 45 minutes it ’s also put to use to determine sound quality			1
mr @entity33 and his team will help companies such as washing - machine maker @entity82 develop metaphors for what sound should , well , sound like			2
motorbike maker @entity85 used the lab , for instance , to make their bikes quieter , while still sounding like @entity89			0
‘ we record products and people listen to them based on semantic terms , like “ expensive ” , “ low quality ” , said mr @entity33			0
‘ we measure their feelings and associations			0
’ @entity97 , meanwhile , uses a similar chamber to test its astronauts			2
they are put in a water - filled tank inside the room to see ‘ how long it takes before hallucinations take place and whether they could work through it ’			2
as mr @entity33 explains , space is like one giant anechoic chamber , so it ’s crucial that astronauts are able to stay focussed			1
mr @entity33 admits that he can last a very respectable 30 minutes in his chamber , despite having an off - putting mechanical heart valve that suddenly becomes very loud indeed once he 's inside .			2
