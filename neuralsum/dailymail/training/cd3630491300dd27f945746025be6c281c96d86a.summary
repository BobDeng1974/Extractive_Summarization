by @entity0 last updated at 8:56 pm on 23rd november 2011 telemarketers have found an ingenious way around caller id , and are using fake identities to get those on the other line to pick up			2
the service , which people can use to screen unwanted calls , is backfiring as ‘ caller id spoofing ’ is becoming spreads throughout the country			2
telemarketers route a call through the @entity14 and back to public telephone networks , erasing the call 's origin			1
likewise , they use software and other inexpensive services to make fake names pop up on caller ids			0
stop calling : @entity24 spoofing tricks people into picking up their phones by using local numbers and even businesses government officials have banned telemarketers from hiding their identity , but now the @entity32 may look into new rules to keep up with technology			1
@entity35 , a division manager for the @entity36 in @entity37 issued a warning to those reaching to answer the phone			0
‘ do not trust your caller id , ’ she told @entity41			0
‘ and if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information , hang up			0
’ one debt collection agency showed up on a @entity51 woman ’s caller id as a string of zeros , a nameless local number , and even ‘ @entity55 ’ ‘ they want you to pick up that phone because you think it ’s somebody else or an important call that you ’re expecting , ’ 46 - year - old @entity51 homemaker @entity56 told the @entity41			1
she was called no less than 30 times a week by the agency , cloaked as other organisations			0
do n't pick up : even recognised numbers could be from telemarketers robo - bothered : @entity69 can blast thousands of customers a minute with prerecorded messages so how exactly do telemarketers spoof unknowing people into taking their calls ? officials say technology makes it easier than ever to mask a call ’s origin by routing a call through the @entity14 and then back through public telephone networks			1
the @entity82 of 2011 , sponsored by @entity85 rep @entity83 , would effectively revoke a 1991 consumer protection act that prohibits telemarketer calls to cell phones			1
it would allow companies to robocall any of the 83 per cent of @entity85 who now use cell phones			1
@entity93 senator @entity92 said he ’d do everything in his power to block the proposed bill in the senate			1
companies argue the bill would allow businesses to call customers for ‘ informational purposes			2
’ it would also revoke the @entity32 ’s @entity102			0
while many companies use that method to legitimately identify themselves , the technology makes it ripe for telemarketers to create aliases			0
robocalls – where an automated computer allows a telemarketer place thousands of pre-recorded calls a second – has also been on the rise			2
the @entity113 reported they received 140,000 complaints of robocalls in september , up from 61,000 the previous year			2
and the technology just keeps getting more sophisticated			0
sometimes , a number will pop up from a legitimate local business , but when the consumer picks up , a telemarketer goes off with a sales pitch			0
consumers have also complained of automated recordings offering to put them on a ‘ do not call ’ list – but only if they enter their phone number first			2
@entity127 , please : @entity128 @entity92 ( right ) is against the @entity129 , which would allow bill collectors and telemarketers to call cell phones @entity133 , who is the head of telephone privacy for the @entity137 attorney general , said a scheme like that was probably meant to collect numbers for future telemarketing calls			1
proposed legislation could bring robocalls and spoofing to more and more cell phones , consumer advocates worry , though for now , the problem mostly exists with landlines			1
‘ do not trust your caller id			0
and if you pick up the phone and someone asks for your personal information , hang up			0
’ - @entity153 of @entity154 manager @entity35 new legislation would open the floodgates to mobile phone robocalls , @entity93 senator @entity92 warned sunday			0
he said that the @entity129 would allow bill collectors and telemarketers to ‘ call you on your cell phone during breakfast , lunch , dinner , no matter if you ’re at home , at school , at the office			1
’ currently , there are laws banning telemarketers from calling cell phones unless the customer gave prior consent .			1

telemarketers ' calls can be wired through the @entity14 and *patched* back to public telephone networks
robocalls up 50 per cent from last year
proposed bill would allow telemarketers to call cell phones and revoke @entity184 list
