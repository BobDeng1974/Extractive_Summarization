by @entity0 on the beach : lifeguard @entity2 in 1999 before she became an mp from her tousled hair , to her sultry pout and that striking red one - piece , this athletic blonde could easily pass for a cast member from @entity9			1
but this beach babe - whose trim and toned figure rivals that of @entity9 star @entity14 - is now more likely to be seen on the backbench than in the lifeguard ’s seat			1
this is none other than @entity2 , @entity19 mp for @entity20 , who worked as a lifeguard in @entity22 in the 90s , before she went on to study classics at @entity25			1
the former champion said the picture , which emerged as the mp gave an interview about the importance of exercise , was taken by her mother in 1999 when she was 20			1
miss @entity2 , 35 , was brought into the party with a swathe of other young , attractive women who were intended to boost the @entity19 ’s popularity among women			1
the champion swimmer trained four hours a day as a child and was a hopeful for the @entity41 @entity40 team			2
she said : ‘ i only became a lifeguard because my swimming never worked out			1
' i realised i just was not going to make it as a swimmer , that was a real shock to the system			2
' most of my friends had gone off to do internships at big law firms and i felt my career had really slipped through the net			2
' but although it was a summer job and was not as lucrative and important as my friends , it taught me a huge deal that i am so grateful for			1
' the skills i learnt i use now in the world of politics			0
' unfortunately , people think talking is the same thing as doing in politics , when it is definitely not			0
' it taught me how to prioritise and manage questions			0
' you ca n’t press release , or statement a live incident , you just have to do it			0
' usually if things go wrong at work you can say " well no one died " , but in this case someone could have done			0
' i met some of my best friends through the job too			0
they really taught me an awful lot and inspired me throughout my life			0
' i ’ve always said to them they have to tell me if i become one of those ‘ prat politicians ’ , and it ’s great to be grounded like that			0
' now : miss @entity2 , mp for @entity86 now			1
the image emerged as the politician gave an interview about the importance of exercise			2

beach babe with tousled hair in a striking red one piece is @entity2
now an mp for @entity86 having worked as a lifeguard in her 20s
back bench @entity19 says image was taken in 1999 by her mother
a woman *'s* looks are more important than her *policies* , say @entity107 *researchers* . they found that women with more *feminine* faces tend to do better at the *ballot* *box* .
