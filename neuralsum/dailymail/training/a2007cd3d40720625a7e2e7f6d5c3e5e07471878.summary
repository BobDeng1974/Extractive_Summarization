these are exciting times for @entity1			1
i can tell you that i am deep in negotiations with @entity6 ’s people right now to make their fight for the @entity10 world title , which was recently vacated by @entity11			1
my hope is to stage it on april 25 at the @entity14 in @entity15 , but currently we are both pushing for home advantage			0
i am confident that with the backing of @entity19 and @entity1 's profile in @entity15 , we can deliver him a home fight and a great deal for @entity6			1
whichever way it works , this is going to be a huge fight between two elite super-middleweights			2
it ’s an extremely tough fight to call			2
@entity1 was at his impressive best last november when he stopped @entity31 @entity32 beat @entity33 but has struggled to show his best since losing twice to @entity11 @entity1 is set to face @entity6 ( left ) while @entity32 is the mandatory challenger to @entity35 ( right ) @entity1 lost a close decision to bitter rival @entity37 when they fought at the @entity14 in 2011 @entity6 has been beaten only once and that was on a split decision to @entity11 in @entity41			1
he has come back very strong and now has 24 wins in 25 fights - he really is a massive threat to @entity1			1
but i believe our man can win this fight and go on to make history as the first @entity52 @entity51 champion to win a world title			1
when he does , it will be interesting to hear @entity32 's thoughts			1
plenty of people will have noticed my recent @entity59 argument with him on the subject of @entity1			2
i must be honest and say i ca n’t understand the way @entity62 thinks sometimes			2
he was offered this chance of a fight with @entity66 but wants unacceptable terms			0
the money that we were offering would have amounted to the biggest payday both fighters had ever landed , but @entity32 is pushing for a fight with @entity74 champion @entity73 ( @entity6 's brother )			1
everyone knew that @entity6 was going to be given an extension by the @entity74 and now @entity62 looks set to have to wait till the autumn / winter for that shot			2
i understood @entity32 ’ most recent offer from them was $ 150,000 ( £ 98,000 ) – please can someone explain to me why @entity62 is going down that route when he could have had a massive fight with @entity1 for potentially twenty times the money ? this game can drive you crazy sometimes			1
i woke up earlier this week to a whole bunch of tweets from people asking me about @entity90 , who has made a few comments about @entity11			1
@entity11 has described a fight with @entity90 as ‘ lose - lose ’ and @entity90 has taken that to mean he is running scared			1
i can assure @entity90 that is not the case			2
i am still in talks to make that fight between two legends of the sport			2
@entity90 has such an awkward style , but i ca n’t see any way how @entity11 would lose a fight in @entity41 supported by 40,000 of his home fans			1
i would say in that environment that he would be virtually unbeatable			0
@entity11 vacated his @entity10 super-middleweight title ( left ) rather than face his mandatory challenger @entity107 @entity11 has not fought since he knocked out @entity32 in their @entity110 rematch in front of 80,000 last may @entity11 could face ring legend @entity90 ( left ) who lost his most recent fight to @entity114 that @entity90 fight and one against @entity116 in @entity117 remain the only fights that have @entity11 interested			1
i am in talks on both			0
if they do n’t happen , then we might have to say goodbye to one of the greatest fighters this country has produced			0
fingers crossed that does n't happen			0
i have a few irons in the fire at the moment for april 25 , when i hope to stage @entity1 ’s world title fight at the @entity14			1
i am also hopeful that the bill will include the fight between @entity10 featherweight world champion @entity134 and @entity135 , his mandatory challenger			2
@entity135 , the @entity136 , is a tremendous fighter and he is ready for this test			0
@entity138 will also have his rescheduled fight with @entity140			0
i ca n’t wait to see the big man fighting again			0
the delays and haggling and saga of @entity146 - @entity145 shows you how complex the business of this sport can be			1
a big part of it will be mind games			1
who can call the shots on what ? believe it or not , mind games come into it a lot			1
it makes me think of the forgettable world - title fight between @entity162 and @entity163 in 2010 and an issue that became a big deal behind the scenes			1
@entity162 's people were insistent that both men had to wear a certain type of glove for the fight , even though @entity163 was contracted to wear a different brand			2
when we got to the rules meeting , @entity163 tried on this new glove and did n’t like it – the thumb in the right hand did n't feel right			0
on top of that the @entity179 agreed with @entity163			0
@entity146 and @entity145 are still negotiating their £ 200million mega-fight for later this year @entity162 played mind games before his fight with @entity163 - but then knocked out his @entity52 rival to compromise , @entity162 's people said @entity163 could wear one brand of glove on his right hand and another on his left			1
i 'm telling you , it was a big fuss			0
but after all that , on fight night @entity162 ’s trainer , @entity193 , comes in the dressing room around an hour before the fight and finally concedes and says it 's fine for @entity163 to wear both of the gloves he wanted to wear at the start			2
anything for the smallest advantage in this sport			0
@entity136 and @entity145 wo n't want to give an inch to the other in the build up to this fight			1
i caught up with @entity209 in @entity210 this week			0
all i can say is i am absolutely staggered to see him bouncing around his gym and training just a few weeks after fracturing his ankle and skull while tackling two burglars			0
he was devastated to miss out on his lightweight world title shot against @entity219 but it is strange how things work out			1
that fight would have been in front of 7,000 or 8,000 people			0
now i am fairly certain i can make a world title fight for him in the summer and there will probably be a crowd of 20,000			1
@entity209 ( left ) is back in the gym just two months after he was attacked when interupting a burglary i was joking with him about the lengths he will evidently go to in order to become a household name			0
in terms of the summer , i 'm confident we could make a fight with the winner of @entity238 or @entity239			0
i am also waiting to see what happens with @entity241			0
if he steps up and vacates his @entity244 belt then i am sure i will deliver a fight with top contender @entity246			0
@entity247 goes to @entity248 for the first time on @entity250 and i really ca n’t call who is going to walk away with the £ 32,000 prize			0
@entity253 and @entity254 , a local fighter , are the favourites but this format always throws up a surprise			0
on the same bill we welcome back @entity261 ’s @entity260 , who had two cracking fights with @entity263			0
he is fighting @entity264 , who has a point to prove after losing his own world title shot last year			1
this is a massive fight for both men			0
it should be a cracker and a win for @entity264 should put him right back in the frame for another title fight .			2

this will be a huge year for @entity1 as he bids to win a world title
i have no idea why @entity32 wants to fight @entity280 instead
i understand @entity32 's last offer from @entity6 was twenty times less than he might have made from @entity107 rematch
@entity11 - @entity90 talks are *ongoing* despite @entity90 ' barbs
@entity146 - @entity145 dance will be full of mind games
