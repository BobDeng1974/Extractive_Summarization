a legendary and outspoken @entity1 comedian is blasting president @entity2 – and the @entity4 community – for letting @entity6 twist in the wind following @entity9 's stunning re-election on tuesday			1
in a radio interview set for broadcast on sunday , @entity10 complains that @entity2 ' does n't see that @entity13 is a problem			1
... he does n't care that they want to wipe us out			0
' ' i 'm not saying he is on the side of the people who literally want to wipe us out , ' @entity10 cautioned , ' but if he 's not on their side , it 's certainly hard to tell which side he 's on			1
because you do n't hear him attacking the @entity13 half as much as he is attacking @entity9			2
' @entity10 phoned the @entity31 - based @entity30 program from his home in @entity33			1
@entity34 heard an advance copy of the segment			0
scroll down for an audio clip biting : comedian @entity10 lashed out at @entity2 , saying ' you do n't hear him attacking @entity13 half as much as he is attacking @entity9 ' finger pointing : @entity2 has been on a streak of aggressive reactions to @entity6 prime minister @entity9 's come - from - behind re-election on tuesday the sharp - tongued comedian focused on the @entity47 's continued objection to settlements build by the @entity6 government in places the @entity51 considers ' occupied ' territories			1
' how often have you heard him say " we have to do something because we have to put a stop to @entity13 's aggressions " ? to @entity13 bombing @entity6 every day ? to all the bombs that are falling ? ' @entity10 asked			1
radio host @entity59 scored the interview with @entity10 , who called the @entity31 - based program from his @entity33 home ' i never heard him complain			1
you know what he complains about ? a settlement was extended			0
two more toilets were added to a certain settlement			0
and a kitchen was extended on the other side			0
' ' between the kitchen and the toilets , that 's creating the whole problem , ' he fumed			0
' and there 's too many kitchens and too many toilets			0
' he said @entity2 's ' design is to intimidate the prime minister of @entity6			2
... he wants a peace - making process that will leave @entity13 intact and [ so ] that the enemies of @entity6 should n't be too disturbed			1
' ' " just because they want to squash @entity6 or eliminate @entity6 " , ' @entity10 imagines @entity2 saying , " there 's no reason why they should n't be given a chance to operate "			1
' the 83 - year - old had his claws out for @entity4 as well , saying @entity93 's entertainment moguls – even those who are @entity1 – tend to be aligned against @entity6			1
' the truth of the matter is that @entity4 is basically anti-semitic , ' he claimed			2
' it 's hard to believe that a @entity1 organization like @entity4 – @entity4 was created by the @entity1 and they were the original creators of almost all the major studios of @entity4			1
... almost every studio is either a partner with a jew , or a @entity1 is a boss , or a @entity1 is involved in it			2
... the @entity1 were always attracted to show business			1
so what do you think happens ? ' @entity106 : @entity9 's @entity108 party won enough seats in @entity6 's @entity110 to control a governing coalition for another four years – long past @entity2 's sell - by date in the @entity47 no settling : @entity13 and other @entity51 factions continue to clash with @entity6 soldiers in ' occupied ' territories as they object to new housing erected by @entity9 's government they 've changed their politics , he told @entity59 , ' as they became richer and richer without working for a living ... where else do you know a person who is not too bright , and never went to college or went to school and cant talk @entity127 and is a total moron or an idiot			1
and he becomes a star and two minute later he is getting $ 20 million a picture			0
' ' now we expect these people making $ 20 million a picture who are comparatively retarded – how will we expect them to suddenly make sense when it comes to the state of @entity6 ? ' ' when you make this much money for nothing , you feel guilty and you feel like you have to prove you are a humanitarian			2
so you have to start forming organizations that help the underdog , ' @entity10 said			0
' and they convince themselves that the @entity145 are the underdogs			2
' ' how they became the underdogs nobody knows			0
but they feel they are being persecuted by the @entity6			0
because the @entity6 are too successful			2
and they 've done too well			0
and they ca n't identify with people who are doing well because they feel guilty for making all this money for nothing so they have to help the underdog			0
