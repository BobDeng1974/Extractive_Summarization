' explanation : the father who inadvertently ignited a controversy by posting a photograph of his daughter with a sign that said ' i pooped in the shower ' has spoken out to defend his actions the picture - in which the girl 's face is clearly visible - went viral on the @entity43 and sparked outrage with some calling the dad ' sick ' and urging social services to investigate him			1
clearly unaware what is going on , she is smiling with the sign on a piece of string round her neck			1
it reads : ' i pooped in the shower and daddy had to clean it up			1
i hereby sign this as permission to use in my yearbook senior year			1
' at first , the father defended his decision to post the photograph on the message board in a humorous manner			1
' only to be fair , i will sign a piece of paper giving her full rights to do this to me when i 'm old and decrepit , ' he wrote			1
but the negative comments continued , so he deleted his account			2
speaking exclusively to @entity10 , he said the whole incident was blown out of proportion			1
defense : the doting father , pictured , whose identity @entity10 chose not to reveal in order to protect his child , said that while people have a right to pass judgement on him and his actions , his intentions were merely to connect with other parents and make light of the stinky situations they find themselves in ' people have every right to pass judgment on me and disagree with my actions , ' he said			1
' i personally thought it was funny and was n't looking for attention but merely trying to give parents that are able to laugh at these silly things a chance to			2
' he said that he 's seen several of these kinds of posts on @entity103 before and they 've never garnered this much attention			2
' i was n’t angry with my daughter i was making light of a messy situation , ' he said			1
sign : he called the people who have attacked him ' bullies ' and said that he was shocked at the outrage his image received , adding that ' if people actually have my daughter ¿ s best interest at heart they will leave us alone ' the reaction was one of outrage and on @entity123 wrote : ‘ you do n't make a child tough and resilient by having her parents , who are meant to be the two people in the world she can trust absolutely , set out to embarrass her in the most public of settings			1
' i 'm very sorry for offending anyone but i refuse to coddle my child and make her think the world is going to be handed to her with padded walls and no worries			2
' father ‘ that makes a child insecure , because it teaches her she ca n't trust the people closest to her			2
’ on another blog a commenter wrote : ‘ the father is one sick piece of c * * * ’ whilst another said : ‘ someone needs to hang a sign on him for being a terrible father that exploits his poor toddler daughter			1
’ the father said he 's been getting threatening emails , phone calls and messages for days , but he 's ignoring them - which is how he tells his own daughter to deal with bullies			1
' the outrage this has caused is terrible			2
to say that i 've been threatened is an understatement , ' he said			2
' i 'm very sorry for offending anyone but i refuse to coddle my child and make her think the world is going to be handed to her with padded walls and no worries			2
this was n't a lesson i was teaching her or some action with ill intent			0
' parenting : the picture - in which her face is clearly visible - went viral on the @entity43 and sparked outrage with some calling the dad ' sick ' and urging social services to investigate him while he had defended his tough love approach , he also regrets that the image reached so many thousands of people			1
he never intended for it to go viral			0
' this does n't make me a terrible father it makes me a man who made one poor choice			0
it makes me human , ' he said			0
his daughter , thankfully , has remained ignorant of the entire ordeal			1
' my biggest fear is it actually is pushed into affecting my daughter who thank @entity194 has remained ignorant of this ordeal , ' he said			1
' if people actually have my daughter ’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone			1
' people have every right to pass judgment on me and disagree with my actions			0
i personally thought it was funny and was n't looking for attention but merely trying to give parents that are able to laugh at these silly things a chance to			0
i 've seen similar things online but i guess they just flew under the radar			0
being in the company of “ shaming ” parents is false because i was n’t angry with my daughter i was making light of a messy situation			1
as far as the negative comments , i 've been treating them the same way i 'm raising my daughter to treat anyone that would bully her i 'm ignoring them			1
i do n't judge them			0
i 've been flooded with support , been properly asked to use my daughters image on like minded blogs and i greatly appreciate that			1
many people loved it and received exactly as intended			0
the outrage this has caused is terrible			0
to say that i 've been threatened is an understatement			0
i 'm very sorry for offending anyone but i refuse to coddle my child and make her think the world is going to be handed to her with padded walls and no worries			0
this was n't a lesson i was teaching her or some action with ill intent			0
i will admit it was poor judgment on my part to allow it to be seen to this magnitude			0
i do n't raise my daughter on poor judgment but i like every other person in the world am capable of making one			1
this does n't make me a terrible father it makes me a man who made one poor choice			0
in her life i 'm certain she 'll meet bullies and people who are just plain mean			0
many of them were in the original post talking flat out perverted and disgusting about my 3 year old			0
this is why i deleted it			0
i will always do everything in my power to prevent that but they 're out there			0
i 've learned a few things from this and that 's that not everyone has the same sense of humor and i 'll just have to keep my photos to family , close friends and myself			0
people are far more easily offended then i actually thought			0
i would appreciate it if this did n't get any bigger			0
my biggest fear is it actually is pushed into affecting my daughter who thank @entity194 has remained ignorant of this ordeal			2
if people actually have my daughter ’s best interest at heart they will leave us alone			2
i do n’t need the approval of people who automatically assume someone is a bad parent because of one instance of disagreement			0
my daughter and my wife are my whole life			2
they are all i really need .			0
