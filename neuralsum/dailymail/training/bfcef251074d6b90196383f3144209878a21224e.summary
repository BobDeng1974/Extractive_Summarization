she has used the money from donating her eggs to treat her kids the full - time mum , from @entity30 , @entity31 , has used the cash to kit out her home but says she is happy to be helping other people experience the joy of motherhood and would donate her eggs even without the money			1
she said : ' the money is a bonus and it allows me to give my children a beautiful home			0
' i feel passionate that everyone gets the chance to be a parent and i love giving people that opportunity			0
' @entity11 joined the fertility market when she considered acting as a surrogate for a friend of a friend struggling to conceive			1
the first time @entity11 donated her eggs , she used the £ 750 to buy bunk beds ( pictured ) for her two kids @entity55 and her two daughters @entity25 and @entity26 in their newly revamped bedroom , paid for by egg donations having enjoyed being pregnant with daughter @entity25 , six , but believing that she and partner @entity59 were not going to have any more children of their own , she was keen to carry another baby , even if it was someone else 's			1
but just as she was about to offer her womb as a temporary home for someone else 's child , she found herself pregnant again			0
after giving birth to @entity26 , two , she decided that even if she was not going to carry another baby she could still help people realise the joy of parenthood			0
@entity11 applied to be an egg donor and found out when she arrived that there was compensation for the ten days of injections and short procedure under anaesthetic			1
in the last two years , she has donated eggs to three different woman who have all fallen pregnant			1
and with the money she has received as compensation , @entity11 has dramatically improved her house and treated her two children to the toys and outings she would n't otherwise be able to afford			1

she claims her boyfriend was initially shocked when she decided to donate her eggs , but has come to understand			0
the last time she made the trip to the clinic and received the £ 750 in return , she took her family on a trip to @entity31 and put half away in an account for the girls to access when they are 18			1
@entity11 said : ' i 've changed the future of another family and i want to look out for my own children 's futures too			1
' at first i wanted to be a surrogate			0
i loved being pregnant and i had no complications - it was just a fantastic experience			1
' then i found out about egg donation and decided that , as i 'd had another daughter by then , this was the thing for me			0
@entity25 ( bottom ) and @entity26 ( top ) have also been treated to toys , including the tricycle ( pictured ) and days out as a result of their mum 's generosity ' a couple of my friends have had trouble conceiving and the thought of being able to give something back was great			2
' i got pregnant so easily i wanted to give someone the thing that i had			0
' and being able to the do the renovations to the house and give the kids something is great			0
' we took them on a big trip to @entity31 and they blew half of one of the payments on the day out which was fun			0
' then the rest of that most recent payment i put away in an account for them which they can have when they are 18			0
' i 've lived with my partner for six years and although he was a bit shocked and worried about the risks at first , he 's fully supported me			2
' my family were just so proud - people were calling me up to congratulate me when i first did it			2
' you can do it a maximum of ten times , which i 'm going to do			2
@entity11 wants to continue donating her eggs seven more times because she likes the feeling of helping other women out ' i want to do it ten times because i love the feeling and the pride i get from helping another family have what i have			1
' there are no bad points to donating eggs			2
you feel good about it and you give a family something they 've always wished for			0
' dr @entity171 , director of the clinic said : ' egg donation is an amazing treatment			0
' with women who want to donate their eggs , we go through all the implications of what it involves and then once their blood tests come back clear we go ahead with the treatment			2
@entity11 , pictured with daughter @entity25 , says she has also started to put money away for her daughters when they are 18 ' they have hormone injections for ten days which come in the form of a pen injection , so it 's not difficult to administer			1
' then they undergo a procedure called egg collection which is done under anaesthesia , absolutely free of pain			0
' in 2012 the @entity194 and @entity195 changed the regulations and allowed the egg donors to be paid a lump sum of £ 750 for their expenses and inconvenience			2
' and because of this change we 're able to get more donors and offer the services in this country			0
