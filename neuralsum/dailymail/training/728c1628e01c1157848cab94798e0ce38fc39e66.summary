the parents of a @entity2 journalist who is thought to have committed suicide after suffering alleged sexual harassment at work have blamed the corporation for failing to prevent his death			1
radio reporter @entity8 , 50 , whose father is a former chief constable , suffocated despite being on suicide watch at a psychiatric hospital			1
close friends and relatives have told the @entity14 he had been left a ‘ shadow of his former self ’ after feeling that bosses failed to act on his complaints about a senior woman colleague			1
tragic : @entity8 , pictured left in 2008 and right , more recently , was being harassed by a female colleague they said his descent into mental illness began after he allegedly spurned unwanted sexual advances by the woman broadcaster during a night out at a restaurant near his home in affluent @entity30 , @entity31			1
mr @entity8 ’s parents said he was forced to leave her in the restaurant because of her behaviour , after which she sent him a flurry of abusive phone messages which have been played to the @entity14 and in which she swore and belittled him			1
@entity40 , the retired chief constable of @entity31 , said that while questions need to be asked at the hospital over how his son was apparently able to take his own life , the @entity2 should hold an investigation into his treatment			1
mr @entity8 , 78 , added : ‘ there is some evidence to support accusations that @entity8 was being sexually harassed or bullied			1
‘ i am shocked to discover the apparent attitudes of certain individuals to their employees at the @entity2			1
‘ i believe he was ignored by his bosses , despite outlining his concerns about the particular staff member he claimed had sexually harassed him			2
‘ he enjoyed his work at the @entity2 but in recent years the situation had become intolerable for him there			1
’ @entity61 's hospital where @entity8 was admitted for help and later found dead mr @entity8 , who lives with wife @entity63 next door to their son ’s home , retired in 1998 after 44 years ’ service – the longest - serving policeman ever in the @entity70			1
he said his son ’s alleged ‘ sexual harassment ’ by the female colleague at @entity74 and @entity31 was the ‘ trigger ’ which caused his mental illness			1
there had been ‘ plenty of opportunities ’ for managers to intervene after he complained , but ‘ nothing was done to help him ’			2
mr @entity8 said he felt more should have been done to pick up the problems as his son was clearly quite distressed			1
their son was admitted to @entity61 ’s psychiatric hospital in @entity87 on friday after suffering minor injuries when he walked in to the road and was hit by a bus in an apparent suicide attempt			1
mr @entity92 said the hospital ‘ specialises in people who are at high risk of committing suicide and he was checked every 15 minutes			1
’ ' it 's what he would have wanted ' : @entity8 's @entity99 , @entity40 , 78 , a retired chief constable , welcomed the involvement of the police he was found choking on sunday and taken to nearby @entity102 , where he was pronounced dead the following afternoon			1
his family and his ex-girlfriend , @entity104 , claimed that after propositioning him in the restaurant , the woman – no longer at the station – began targeting him in other ways at work , deliberately cutting him off while he was on air			0
it is understood that mr @entity8 , a bachelor who covered south @entity31 for the station , first complained about her to management after she sent him an unpleasant email			1
he is thought to have approached bosses again early this year to complain about being sidelined at the station , concerned he had been overlooked for news reading and presenting opportunities			2
miss @entity104 said he then became consumed by worry and stress ‘ because he knew that people do n’t go very far by speaking out against organisations like the @entity2 ’			1
he was diagnosed with depression and suffered a breakdown soon afterwards			0
miss @entity104 , 28 , a freelance theatre director , told the @entity14 that the @entity2 had paid for him to receive counselling			1
his gp and the corporation ’s own occupational health specialist all advised him not to return to work at the station for the good of his health			2
but despite this bosses told him he would have to return full time before he could think about transferring to another station			0
mr @entity8 eventually went back to work three months later , but on a part - time basis			1
miss @entity104 said she split from mr @entity8 in 2010 , after four years together , but the pair remained close			1
she said that in recent months he had been ‘ the happiest i had known him ’ and was considering returning to freelance journalism			0
she said that for years he felt unable to speak out against his tormentor			0
when he finally did pluck up the courage to speak out , she said the office climate left him fearful for his job and future			0
miss @entity104 added : ‘ @entity8 told me that this woman treated many people badly at the station , but nothing was done because of her senior status			1
' it seemed everybody was scared to tackle her			0
people need to know that this culture still exists – of allowing certain individuals to be in control , when others do n’t seem to matter			0
’ @entity8 recorded the following three messages from his female colleague after he left her in the restaurant			1
‘ thanks a lot , you ’ve p * * * * * on your chips			0
i ’m trying to get a taxi to @entity74			0
do n’t ever ever ever think of me as your mate again			0
do what you have to at the @entity2 because you are a loser on 27 grand a year			1
but do n’t ever ever encroach on me or my talent			0
’ ‘ hi , it ’s me			0
i ’m in a taxi from @entity30 to @entity74			0
@entity8 , do n’t ever count on me as a friend			2
please do n’t think you can rely on me – you ’ve insulted me			0
you have left me stranded in @entity30			0
you are flaky , you are poor , you are weak			0
i do n’t want anything to do with you except on the radio			2
’ ‘ hi , it ’s 9.21			0
i ’m back at my car			0
do n’t ever ever ever presume friendship with me again , all right ? goodbye			2
’ neither @entity181 , responsible for policing in @entity30 , or @entity182 , which covers @entity74 , could find any record of mr @entity8 reporting the alleged harassment			2
the woman he accused said there was never a complaint against her and she denied any wrongdoing			0
she said she was asked by managers to try to help him			0
she told the @entity14 : ‘ i got a message to say @entity8 had died			2
i ’m really upset about it and ca n’t say any more			0
’ told of the @entity8 family ’s allegations that his illness had been triggered by her alleged behaviour , she said : ‘ i do n’t know what you are talking about ’ and put the phone down			2
mr @entity8 ’s colleagues are being offered counselling by the @entity2			1
his funeral is to be held on wednesday			0
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ our thoughts and condolences are with @entity8 ’s family at this sad time			1
' this is a difficult time for everyone who knew him			0
' the @entity2 is committed to working constructively with the family to ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed			2
it would not be appropriate to comment further until the facts are established			0
’ an inquest into mr @entity8 ’s death was opened yesterday at the @entity181 in @entity214			2
coroner @entity215 was told the radio presenter died of ‘ asphyxiation ’ as a result of a ‘ plastic bag in an airway ’			2
