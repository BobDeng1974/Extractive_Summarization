it is the stuff of dreams : one of the world ’s most beautiful beaches complete with swaying palm trees , crystal blue waters and an endless procession of bikini - clad girls sashaying across the sand			2
this is the sight that will greet @entity12 and his @entity14 colleagues as they step out on their balconies at the @entity16 after arriving in @entity17 to prepare for the @entity18			2
but should they turn just a little to the left , they will face an altogether more disturbing vision : the stinking filth and squalor of the biggest shanty town in @entity26 spilling down the hillside less than half a mile away			0
hands up : an undercover female detective on patrol in the @entity30 as police tackle drug gangs patrol : heavily armed police officers monitor the favela to prevent the gangs from taking control the @entity30 favela is a place where crackling gunfire lights up the night sky , and where police death squads and drug gangs battle for control of the sewage - filled streets			1
there has been an orgy of extra-judicial killing by @entity17 ’s military police – the result of a government crackdown to ‘ pacify ’ the favelas before the world ’s media arrive			1
last week a popular local @entity56 was murdered by police just feet from @entity59 ’s famed @entity58 , leading to violent demonstrations			1
on monday nine buses were set on fire in protest at police brutality			1
seven police officers have died in clashes since the start of the year			1
@entity30 is a maze of haphazard steps carved into the hillside leading to a muddle of one - bedroom shanty homes made from breeze blocks where 200,000 deprived and desperate @entity59 citizens live			1
stalls sell live chickens next to dead ones and fly - covered fruit and veg			0
there is a ceaseless cacophony of motorcycle horns , loud music and yelling voices			0
inside every shack , no matter how tiny , families crowd around television screens			0
eighteen - year - old @entity88 is among them			0
his father was snatched by police who mistook him for a drug dealer , then killed him			1
violence : human rights activists have complained that the police have gone overboard to pacify the favelas the death last year of @entity99 , a 42 - year - old bricklayer , is now a cause @entity100 25 officers including the head of the favela ’s police force are standing trial			1
officers are said to have tasered , strangled and then drowned their victim during a 40 - minute torture session before dumping the body in a nearby forest			0
his son tells me : ‘ @entity114 would have been just another statistic , except the favela rose up			1
’ the protest spawned riots across @entity17 and led to three deaths when police fired on @entity121 continues : ‘ the case got so much publicity they had to charge the cops			1
i hope they go to jail but @entity17 is a corrupt country			0
the police have a licence to kill			1
@entity130 will come and go but the violence will remain			0
’ clandestine police ‘ body dumps ’ have sprung up			1
one notorious dumping ground – @entity135 – has been given the gruesome nickname ‘ the microwave ’ because of reports of nightly fires and the smell of burning flesh			2
one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said : ‘ the police cars enter without lights			2
one time we found four bodies riddled with bullets			0
we found a hand sticking up from the ground			0
’ when @entity17 was awarded the tournament in 2007 the government introduced a programme to ‘ pacify ’ hundreds of favelas			1
officials refuse to reveal the numbers who have died since the ‘ clean - up ’ operation started , but in @entity30 alone ten men have been killed since january			1
now the authorities are promising to ‘ secure ’ the slums using an elite military police squad called @entity165 , a shadowy organisation of highly - trained special forces whose logo is a dagger piercing a skull			2
tackle : the @entity17 government began ' cleaning up ' favelas in 2007 , as soon as they were awarded @entity18 last week @entity175 , 56 , buried her only son @entity176 , 26 , a popular dj and dancer after he was killed by police in the @entity181 - @entity180 favela which overlooks @entity58			1
police are thought to have mistaken him for a drug dealer			2
@entity175 says : ‘ the police told me he had fallen and died but when i saw his body in the morgue i found a bullet hole in his back			2
the only reason i got his body back was that people filmed the cops on cellphones			0
otherwise he would have “ disappeared ” along with all the others			0
’ she adds : ‘ there will be blood on the streets during the @entity18 , be sure of it			0
’ the number of registered ‘ disappearances ’ in @entity59 has surged from 3,997 in 2009 to 6,004 last year			0
