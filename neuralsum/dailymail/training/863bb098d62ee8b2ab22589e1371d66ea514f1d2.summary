by @entity0 @entity1 and @entity2 have been spotted searching for a new apartment as their current apartment rent is too steep			2
the disgraced former congressman and his political advisor wife have been living in an apartment which is estimated to cost $ 12,000 - per - month in rent since he resigned amid a sexting scandal in 2011			1
the @entity12 apartment was being rented to them by @entity15 donor @entity14 , who is close with @entity16 , the former president who officiated @entity1 and @entity2 's nuptials			1
@entity18 digs : @entity2 and @entity1 have been living on @entity18 ever since he sold his @entity20 co-op during the 2011 sexting scandal that required him to resign from office inevitable : @entity1 blasted @entity23 on @entity24 after the broker spoke to a tabloid about what apartment the couple were considering now they are looking to move to a slightly cheaper apartment with their son @entity31 but are apparently staying in the neighborhood			1
the @entity34 reported that the couple have been seen looking at a three - bedroom , two - and - a - half bath apartment in a doorman building on east 23rd street			1
@entity23 realtor @entity37 allegedly showed the couple the $ 8,000 - per - month apartment in the modern building			2
' he did n’t talk much ; she was very nice			0
she was asking all the questions and was way more vocal , ' mr @entity37 told @entity43			0
it comes as little surprise that just hours after the report was published , the former @entity46 blasted the real estate company for not only allowing their broker to publicly speak about their working relationship , but to publicize it on their own @entity24 account			0
even though @entity1 put down the company as having ' no class brokers ' , he did n't deny the report			0
the new building that they are looking at is only a few blocks further east than their current apartment , and it comes as little surprise that they would like to stay in the area : @entity1 's brother @entity65 owns @entity66 and @entity67 , two restaurants in the neighborhood			2
daddy duty : @entity1 has been regularly spotted with his son in the area around their apartment , taking now - 2 - year - old @entity31 to the grocery store and the playground in @entity77 the couple married in june 2010 and their home base was the apartment he owned in @entity82 , which fell in his congressional district in @entity20			1
shortly after he resigned in 2011 - meaning that he no longer had to live in the district that he once represented - the couple sold his co-op apartment and moved to one of @entity89 's most expensive neighborhoods			1
before the scandal , @entity2 was best known in political circles for being @entity93 's top aide , and she has worked with the former secretary of state for decades			0
@entity1 has said in previous interviews that he gave his wife full reign to pick their new apartment amid the controversy he put them both through			0
they have been seen walking around the neighborhood by @entity104 , with @entity1 shopping in the local grocery store and bringing their now - 2 - year - old son @entity31 to the playground in nearby @entity77			1
modern look : the couple are now reportedly looking at an apartment in this building on 23rd street , which is only a few blocks east of the apartment they have called home for the past two years for a while , they hoped that they would be calling @entity121 home , as @entity1 attempted to re-enter the public sphere by running for mayor , but his candidacy ended in flames when more dirty sexts and emails were released by a young woman who had a virtual relationship with the married man after he had already resigned from office			2
now @entity2 is still working for mrs @entity93 , and is considered to be one of the closest ‘ gate keepers ’ to the likely @entity15 presidential candidate			0
@entity1 has made a guest appearance on the new @entity138 political comedy @entity139 and is restarting some of the consulting work that he had been doing in the time between his resignation and his failed mayoral bid .			0
