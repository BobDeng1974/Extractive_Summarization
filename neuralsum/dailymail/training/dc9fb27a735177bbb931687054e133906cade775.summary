the seasonal ' sport ' involves inserting toothpicks into two of the chick - shaped marshmallows , placing them in the microwave a few inches apart and watching them expand			1
whichever @entity10 grows first , causing its toothpick to pierce the other , is the winner			2
whichever peep pierces the other first is the winner the loser peep slowly deflates after it is popped by the wooden weapon			2
this unlikely tradition actually has quite the following - a @entity28 page dedicated to the battles has received 150 likes			1

get out the microwaves and toothpicks ! peep jousting ! ! ! ' another fan wrote : ' i 'm not sure why one would do anything other than @entity10 jousting with @entity45			2
' but while enthusiasm for the trend appears to be widespread , the best peep jousting technique remains a point of dispute			1
to discover whether fresh or stale @entity45 make the best warriors , @entity51 conducted an experiment using one box of marshmallows that had been left open for two weeks , and one that was sealed			2
after the fresher @entity45 won five battles , the website declared them victorious			2
victory : after a few seconds , the pink marshmallow can be seen expanding and piercing its rival candy			0
' oh i won ! i totally stabbed you , ' says its human supporter sugary collapse : when the microwave door is opened , both @entity45 appear to have grown significantly , but then they gradually sink and deflate one excited group of friends posted a video on @entity70 of their own marshmallow competition			0
the clip shows a pair of dueling @entity45 - one green and one pink - placed face - to - face in the microwave			1
one of the spectators remarks on the fact that their toothpicks are aimed strategically at the head : ' they 're going for the glory , ' she says			0

peeps are often placed in @entity3 baskets and atop mantlepieces as decoration , but there is also a long tradition of using them in other creative ways around the springtime holiday			1
versatile : there is a tradition of using peeps in creative ways around the springtime holiday , including featuring them in artwork , sculptures and dioramas indeed , a section on the candy 's website called @entity113 your @entity114 displays artwork , sculptures and even scientific experiments using the marshmallows			0
and they are even sometimes featured in dioramas depicting important moments in history			0
this year the colorful candies are celebrating their 60th anniversary , and they seem to show no sign of declining in popularity			1
