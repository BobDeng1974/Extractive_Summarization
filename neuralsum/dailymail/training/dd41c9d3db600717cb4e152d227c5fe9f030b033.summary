for at least a decade i have been bombarded with proclamations from friends and strangers that @entity4 is the most beautiful place in the world			1
having travelled a fair portion of the planet in my 28 years , i denied that anywhere could match @entity10 , my favourite city			1
but at last i decided to put it to the test - and found myself sitting at @entity13 , arms tightly folded , marinaded in a light scepticism			1
our time was limited , so we chose just three portions of @entity4 , starting in @entity19			1
simply gorgeous : @entity21 's travels took her across to the fabled @entity4 island of @entity23 we landed at 9pm and were taken straight to our hotel , the @entity26 president hotel up in the hills , a ten - minute drive from the popular old town			1
from the outside it looks like a golf course			1
from the inside , it looks like somewhere @entity35 would stay			2
( cue me immediately looking around for @entity35			2
) to call this hotel grand would be a vast understatement			2
it had the panoramic views of the ocean and the space and luxury that i 've not yet encountered anywhere before			2
i skipped all the way to my room			2
at £ 200 a night ( although it would have been far cheaper had i not booked about 15 minutes before we left for the airport ... ) , i hoped for something relatively decent			2
but a lovely kingsize room , with full patio and breakfast table , practically on the private beach was not what i was expecting			2
one very inelegant hop over my balcony and i would be feet - on - sand			1
@entity62 came after a wonderful sleep and the view was officially ridiculous			2
@entity65 and miles of perfectly clear - blue @entity66 , surrounded by untouched islands and peppered with the odd palm tree for effect			1
i headed with caution to the breakfast ' buffet '			2
i hate the word buffet			2
you 're often greeted by slightly cold , very salty , mass - cooked slop			1
a long - term ambition : @entity21 had wanted to visit @entity4 for a long time - but was unprepared for its beauty here i walked into the kind of breakfast selection that gives you a panic attack			1
' how the hell can i get all of this into my mouth before 11am ? ' tailor - made omelettes and pancakes cooked by on - hand chefs			1
beautiful fruits , cheeses , fresh smoothies , sausages , vegetables and delicious @entity4 cakes			1
this was simply not conducive to having to wear a bikini			2
once i had consumed enough for a small family , and was barely able to breathe , i rolled on to the private hotel beach			2
luxury loungers , fluffy towels , perfect , clean , calm sea ... water sports heavily available , lots of water toys for babies and very disabled - and family - accessible			1
one tip : as @entity4 is certainly rocky , buy those hideous aqua shoes			1
do n't go in the sea barefoot			2
in my first hour i stepped on a sea urchin that gifted me with about 40 spines , wedged deep into my foot			2
i ca n't recall that kind of pain before			2
the pain led me to say the most unbelievable thing out loud : ' oh @entity117 , i wish i had a pair of @entity119 ' ( said by nobody under 85 , ever )			2
but seriously , do it			2
by 8 o'clock we headed out to the famed @entity19 old town , which is hidden within enormous stone walls			1
everything inside is made of marble , so you walk into what feels like a grand , pristine film set , bursting with character and beautiful architecture			2
a city of star quality : @entity21 was captivated by the history and beauty of @entity136 it is insane to think that little over 20 years ago the place was brutally bombed in the 1991 siege			1
it is therefore doted upon and cherished by its residents			0
the restaurants are busy and full of traditional @entity145 cuisine ( pizza , pasta , fish )			0
and the town is packed with young people			0
the little alleys contain quaint bars with the steps covered in cushions for passers - by to rest and drink			1
the atmosphere is bustling and alive			0
it 's genuinely one of the most stunning places i have ever seen			0
it takes hours to investigate every nook and cranny and every staggering view at the top of the enormous flights of marble stairs			0
we went back three nights in a row , each time sampling different alleyway restaurants and bars			0
they all have pretty much the same food , same price , same menu , same standard , so i wo n't tell you where to go			0
just avoid the main courtyard as the touristic nature diminishes the standard of food			0
and the pizza looks a week old			1
after only three days investigating @entity136 and falling madly in love with the sights , i had shamelessly replaced @entity10 with this as my favourite city			0
youthful vibe : split is a city with a real party spirit , according to @entity21 next , on to @entity194 , a three - hour scenic bus journey up the coast			1
as we drove into town , i was rather concerned that it looked like a lads ' holiday destination			0
the word ' kebab ' was written everywhere			0
but as we got closer to the centre , where our hotel was , the architecture and peace made a strong comeback			0
we had booked into the @entity209			0
to get in , you walk through a charming pink courtyard , where you are met by staff so friendly and helpful you almost feel suspicious			0
we @entity213 are savages in comparison with the service you get in @entity4			1
we were taken up to our room through a cute hotel with the decor of a plush luxury yacht on the inside and into our lovely deluxe room			0
everything was new and modern but still very elegant			0
the bed was comfortable and the room very quiet , despite being in the heart of the action			1
get there on the early side as the hot food was barely tepid at 10am			0
but the pastries were fresh and tasty , and i have never seen such a multicultural breakfast in my life			0
@entity237 fry - up , croissants , @entity240 cake , and a very casual tray of crayfish sushi			1
split is full of life			1
but i warn you - it 's very young life			1
the average age is between 18 and 24			0
loud , pumping open - air bars and clubs line the streets			1
once you get into the old town , things quieten down and you can have some lovely grilled fish in the courtyards			0
the hotel staff recommended a restaurant called @entity258 , so we went			0
mediocre starter and absolutely excellent main course			0
the kind of chicken and fish that makes you slightly emotional			0
after that we sauntered along the beautifully preserved palace walls , apparently haunted by ghosts , none of which i was greeted by , thank @entity117			0
away from it all : as well as beaches of varying crowdedness , @entity23 deals in quiet island charm shops are open till late and you are merely five minutes from the port , which is home to some of the most incredible yachts i have ever seen			1
( i looked around for @entity35 again			0
) the next day i decided @entity194 was a little too restless for me			0
so i hopped on a very cheap ferry ( they leave every hour and a half until midnight ) to the nearest island , @entity23			1
it was 45 painless minutes , and so worth it			0
such a charming place - by far the most family - friendly i have ever visited			1
plentiful water activities for children , clean beaches and the prettiest port in @entity4 so far			1
@entity23 is known for its v - shaped beach , @entity300			1
it 's an expensive cab ride to and fro , there is no shade , and it is rammed with tourists			0
instead , walk from the ferry and find your own pretty little coves , visited only by locals and with the kind of views that are completely overwhelming			0
the kind of views that can make you forget that you have cellulite , or even what your name is			0
for dinner we ventured to a quaint little restaurant called @entity317 , in a corner by the port			1
beautiful , simple , fresh food - it was the best meal in @entity4 so far			1
we hopped on the ferry back and had our last sleep in @entity4			1
it was miserable to be leaving			0
the final day was spent wandering around @entity194 's lovely old town , full to the brim with people wearing ancient @entity329 clothing acting out historical scenes in the streets to the delight of the crowds , mostly the women			0
the soldiers wear very little skirts			0
and @entity4 men are hot			1
( wear sunglasses if with partner to allow you to ogle in peace			0
) generally i give what i saw of @entity4 five stars			1
what a beautiful country , what lovely people			0
what a relaxed and welcoming place that has over-come staggering adversity to become one of the most desirable spots on the planet			0
i was horrified to be leaving and i booked my next trip there the minute i finished this review			0
@entity356 ( www.prestigeholidays.co.uk/croatia , 01425 480400 ) offers one - week holidays in @entity4 from £ 999 per person			1
this price includes return flights from @entity13 with @entity370 to @entity19 and back to @entity13 from @entity194 , a group b hire car , four nights ' b&b at the @entity19 president and three nights ' b&b at the @entity365 in @entity194 .			1

radio 1 star fulfils long - term dream to visit the @entity66 shores of @entity4
@entity376 spends a *blissful* week in historic @entity19 and party - loving split
she also ventured across to the island of @entity23 in search of quiet beaches
