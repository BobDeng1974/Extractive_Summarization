an @entity1 prog - rock star who has sold millions of records is at the centre of an online storm after a @entity6 ambulance did not have enough fuel to take him to hospital			1
@entity9 , 47 , a drummer with the iconic prog - rock outfit @entity10 , said that he was barely able to stand or lift his arms shortly before he was due to go on stage at the @entity13 in @entity6 on saturday night			1
paramedics attended the scene and said that the star needed to be taken to hospital so that his mystery illness could be treated			1
however , they admitted that they did n't have enough petrol to get him there			0
he was eventually given a lift by a fan , but when he arrived at @entity32 , doctors forced him to wait because his condition was not life - threatening @entity9 claims that ambulance staff said that he should find alternative transport , although the @entity36 denies this			1
the drummer asked fans waiting for him to perform with rock band @entity40 if they would drive him to the nearby @entity42			1
once a volunteer was found , @entity9 was driven to @entity32			2
a @entity36 spokesman said : ' an ambulance crew arrived at an address on @entity47 in @entity13 to take a patient to the @entity49 at the @entity51 hospital ,			2
' the vehicle was low on fuel and requested another ambulance to take the patient to hospital			2
the patient decided to make their own way to hospital so the second ambulance was not sent			2
' when asked if the paramedics would have been allowed to fill up at the petrol station located next door to the venue , a spokesman said that he ' was n't sure ' , but confirmed that the crew ' had been on the road since 6.30am and it was their last job '			2
angry : @entity9 , 47 , an @entity1 rock star , spoke out against the @entity42 in @entity6 in an extended @entity71 rant but the litany of bad luck did not end there			1
according to fellow band member @entity40 , after whom the group is named , ' it took us 30 minutes because of traffic that the ambulance probably could 've avoided '			1
to make matters worse , when @entity9 arrived at @entity42 , staff told him that he would have to wait to allow them to deal with more urgent , life - threatening cases			1
at this point , @entity9 appeared to lose his temper			0
' a very special no thanks to the staff at the @entity42 for not seeing me regardless of telling them that there is an audience waiting for our show to begin , ' he wrote on @entity71			1
' i finally left without seeing a doctor in order to make tonight 's show			0
i have no idea how the hell i 'm going to make it through this show			0
i ca n't even stand up or lift my arms			0
' his online rant generated thousands of responses , as fans and members of the public accused him of being a ' diva ' and trying to exploit his fame to go to the front of the queue			1
one fan wrote : ' not to be rude , but if someone was dying , i 'd hope they did n't move you to the front of the line just to get you to a show			0
' another fan , who said he was a doctor at the @entity51 , wrote : ' as much as i 'd jump at the opportunity to help you if i actually was on call tonight , please try to understand			0
' us healthcare professionals do n't want anyone to wait or suffer at all			0
' however , we encounter life - threatening conditions every hour , sometimes every minute , that stop us from seeing others that may be slightly less unwell , as quickly as we 'd like			1
' @entity131 sucks , i know , but dying patients suck even more			0
' the intensity of the row provoked @entity9 's wife , @entity135 , 51 , to leap to his defence			2
' some of you people are just so horrible , ' she said			0
' he did n't ask for special treatment because he was famous , his concern was the fans that paid good money to see a concert that was about to get cancelled			0
' @entity9 later apologised to staff at the @entity51			2
end of the road : an ambulance is parked outside the @entity51 hospital , @entity6			1
an @entity1 rock star , @entity9 , 47 , has complained that when he fell ill in @entity6 , a paramedic team was unable to transfer him to hospital because their ambulance had run out of petrol ' it was not a personal attack or rage against @entity156 's health care system in general , of which i know nothing about , ' he said			1
' i did not expect any special treatment or wanted to be put ahead of anybody else in need			0
we only wanted some answers as the clock was ticking until showtime			0
' on @entity71 , @entity9 said that the episode was ' one of the worst days of my life '			1
@entity42 declined to comment .			0
