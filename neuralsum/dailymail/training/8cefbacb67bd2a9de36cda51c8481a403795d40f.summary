by @entity1 reporter published : 18:14 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 09:07 est , 7 may 2013 a fully - functional plastic gun has been made from a 3 - d printer and fired succesfully			1
@entity5 sen. @entity4 said sunday that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban these weapons , which would be undetectable from metal detectors			1
' we ’re facing a situation where anyone -- a felon , a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable			1
it ’s stomach - churning , ' he said			2
it is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of a chosen material			2
the layers are then joined together to create the final shape			0
it takes blueprints from computer aided design and ' slices ' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing			0
the technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace			0
it can be used to create almost any shape			0
' guns are made out of plastic , so they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or sporting event , ' @entity4 said , according @entity55			2
' only metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to be detected by metal detectors , for instance , when you go through an airport			2
' a terrorist , someone who ’s mentally ill , a spousal abuser , a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage			2
' @entity4 wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new bill would add a ban on plastic high - capacity magazines			0
' people have made silencers , stocks , triggers and lots of other gun parts			1
they can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone with one of these printers – and the printers cost about $ 1,000 – can make one , ' @entity4 said			0
' it 's stomach churning ' : @entity5 senator @entity4 plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from @entity19 printers easy to make : @entity4 says a plastic , @entity19 gun can be made for as little as $ 1,000 and can be accessed by any terrorist , convict or mentally ill person the plastic handgun is made when the user inputs a digital blueprint of the weapon and it is then printed with molded plastic			1
the technology is not new , it has been around for more than a decade , but only recently have people thought to use for weapons manufacturing , @entity4 said			0
while there is current law banning all - plastic weaponry , the weapons have just one metal piece , which is too small to be reliably detected by metal detectors and can easily be swapped out for a plastic piece			0
@entity114 , the firm behind the gun , has put plans for it online so anyone can download them			1
founder @entity118 has worked for over a year on the project , and the gun is made from 15 parts , which the only non-plastic part a common nail , which acts as the firing pin			1
@entity118 says the design is based on the one - shot pistols that were designed to be air - dropped over @entity127 during @entity128 as inspiration - and also called the @entity129			0
the future of weapons ? the @entity19 printed gun being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home the team beginning to assemble the gun after each pat had been @entity19 printed and cleaned			1

plans to @entity19 print the gun have been made available online for free
*organisation* behind the gun posted @entity148 video of it being fired
