@entity0 may well have found the leader of their brave new world in @entity4 on saturday night as they beat @entity6 3 - 0			1
@entity8 midfielder @entity7 scored the first with a glorious shot from the edge of the area and ran the game for the @entity15 champions before being given a standing ovation as he went off on 80 minutes			1
all the controversy in the build - up to the match over @entity20 ’ comments that he wished his team - mates ‘ had the same commitment for their clubs as for their country ’ was forgotten as @entity7 put on a show			2
@entity20 ' comments were interpreted as criticism of @entity30 and more particularly @entity31 who had pulled out of this qualifier despite playing against @entity34 last weekend			0
the defender later said he had not been referring to any players in particular but @entity31 ’s absence had not gone down well with several senior @entity39 players			0

without the @entity112 pair however , and with only one @entity106 player - a rare sight across the last seven years in which they have won three major tournaments - @entity0 made light work of beating @entity6			2
it was that sole @entity106 representative , @entity115 ’s @entity63 , who crossed for @entity0 ’s first chance of the game but @entity51 ’s @entity56 managed to put the effort wide on five minutes			1
on 18 minutes @entity7 showed his team - mates how to finish as @entity0 went ahead with a moment ’s magic			1
he has been likened to @entity123 at @entity8 where supporters are desperate to see the @entity126 born midfielder succeed even if it means he sometimes plays instead of @entity127			2
the @entity128 would have been proud of this first - half strike with @entity7 finding the top corner from just outside the area leaving visiting keeper @entity132 rooted to the spot			1
within three minutes @entity0 had doubled their lead when @entity136 scored from even further out , catching a defensive clearance perfectly and leaving @entity132 helpless again			1
at the other end @entity60 was having a quiet night back in the team for the injured @entity140 , who dislocated a finger in training in midweek , leaving the way clear for the captain to return to the side			0
@entity68 , playing at centre - forward in place of @entity31 , headed @entity56 ’s cross just wide at the start of the second - half as @entity0 kept up their domination			1
and 10 minutes into the second period it was @entity56 who scored his 16th goal for @entity0 , sweeping in @entity57 ’s cross from the right			1
@entity7 was ably aided in midfield by @entity159 ’s @entity43 and by a lively @entity63 who was given a standing ovation on 68 minutes when he finally made way for @entity162 forward @entity64			2
@entity63 played in @entity4 for @entity164 before he moved to @entity165 , @entity126 and then @entity115			2
@entity7 ( second right ) celebrates with his @entity0 team - mates after opening the scoring with a sublime strike on saturday @entity6 ' @entity88 lies on the floor with his hands on his heads during theloss against @entity0 on saturday @entity0 midfielder @entity63 ( left ) fight for the ball with @entity6 ' @entity174 during the 2016 @entity176 qualifier @entity6 goalkeeper @entity81 puts his hands on hist hips and looks on in frustration after conceding from @entity7 @entity0 players gather around and celebrate in a group after @entity56 grabs their third goal of the night against @entity6 @entity7 followed him off with 10 minutes left and was given a similar ovation			1
@entity0 brought on young @entity183 striker @entity67 for his debut and it seems @entity185 is finally bringing through the young players that @entity0 hope will revive their fortunes after their disastrous @entity190 campaign in @entity191 this summer			0
@entity56 hit a post as the hosts went for the fourth but @entity6 did not concede again			0
they now face @entity194 on tuesday in @entity195 and do not resume their qualification until @entity197 visit @entity0 in march			0
they can go comfortably into the new year knowing their campaign to top @entity199 is right back on track even without the absent @entity201 and @entity31			0
