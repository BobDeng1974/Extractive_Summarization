@entity0 is confident @entity1 will make up lost ground on their rivals for a @entity5 place			1
the @entity6 missed the chance to close the gap on the @entity16 's top four as they were held to a goalless draw by a determined @entity12 side who restricted their hosts to very few opportunities			1
with manager @entity17 having instilled a slightly more defensive approach in recent weeks - which has had the desired effect as they are now unbeaten in four matches in all competitions having lost their previous four - it has made it tougher to break down sides , particularly at home			1
@entity0 ( right ) believes @entity1 can still claim a @entity5 spot this season @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 struggled to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity12 on saturday having just edged past @entity32 last week they could not manage a similar feat against the @entity12 but , although he watched another opportunity to stake their claim for a @entity5 spot slip by , @entity0 is optimistic things will continue to improve			1
' we knew it was going to be a tough game			0
they defend very well , they showed that against @entity44 ( earning a goalless draw last weekend ) , ' said the @entity47 defender , who now turns his attention to tuesday 's must - win @entity5 match at home to @entity52			2
' at the end we have one point , which is hard to take but this league is tough and every team fights - @entity57 won against @entity44 which shows this league is really difficult			2
' it is better but last season we did much better than that			0
we have had a difficult start but we are catching up slowly and surely			2
there is more work to do , definitely			0
@entity17 has instilled a slightly more defensive approach in recent weeks @entity1 captain @entity29 was rested for a second @entity16 game this season ' last season we were outstanding in every area and going forward it was amazing , defensively we were strong , but this season has been difficult			1
' when you have a tough start it is always difficult because the confidence is not always there			0
' we are catching up and the team feels more secure and we need to keep going in that direction			0
' saturday 's draw means @entity12 have now lost just one of the last five and , of the six goals they have conceded in that time , four were against @entity81 in midweek			1
@entity82 goes down after a challenge from @entity84 at @entity85 on saturday ' on a positive note , we are becoming a very difficult team to play against ; we stopped @entity44 from scoring last week and now we 've stopped @entity1 from scoring at @entity85 , ' said visiting manager @entity88			2
' that 's a credit to the players and the way they 've been playing			0
' the team have been defending well at the back and really worked their socks off and then , up front , we 've shown confidence to get forward and create chances to score goals			0
