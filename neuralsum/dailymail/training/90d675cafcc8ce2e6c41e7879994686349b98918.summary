@entity1 news anchor @entity0 has been forced to admit that he was n't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of @entity5			1
the nightly news anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire			1

on wednesday , @entity0 apologized during his @entity17 bulletin and said that he was ' mistaken '			1
later that evening he did n't seem too worried about the furor as he enjoyed a @entity20 game with his good friend @entity21			0
' i do n't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another			2

' the story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of @entity5 when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an rpg , ' @entity0 said on tuesday evening			1
' our traveling @entity49 team was rescued , surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the @entity53 3rd @entity52			0

according to the crew members , @entity0 arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing			1

@entity1 reported the incident on march 26 , 2003 , with the headline , ' @entity5 : helicopter @entity1 ’s @entity0 was riding in @entity90			1
' however when the incident was reported the next day by the @entity93 it stated that a ‘ chopper was hit and forced to land			2

‘ some men on the ground fired an rpg through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours			0
' there was small arms fire			0
… all four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor , ’ he recalled			0
by the next year @entity0 was claiming on his blog that ' all four of our low - flying chinooks took fire			2
' ' the @entity55 flying in front of ours ( from the @entity132 ) took an rpg to the rear rotor , as all four of our low - flying chinooks took fire , ' he wrote			0

‘ i feel terrible about making this mistake , especially since i found my own writing about the incident from back in ' 08 , and i was indeed on the @entity55 behind the bird that took the rpg in the tail housing just above the ramp , ’ he wrote			0
‘ because i have no desire to fictionalize my experience ( we all saw it happened the first time ) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened , i think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area -- and the fog of memory over 12 years -- made me conflate the two , and i apologize			1
