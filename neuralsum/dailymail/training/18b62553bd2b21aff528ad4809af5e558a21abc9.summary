please save this bear : the spectacled bear , which lives in @entity2 and is the real - life @entity3 , is in danger of becoming extinct they ’re bears all right , and they come from darkest @entity8 — but they ’re very seldom found on @entity10 wearing a luggage label that says : ‘ please look after this bear			1
’ spectacled bears seem to be specially equipped for hard stares of the kind that @entity17 taught @entity3 — the children ’s favourite , based on them , who ’s now a movie superstar			1
their eyes tend to be surrounded by pale or gingerish markings that exaggerate the facial expression			1
these marks vary — you can tell one individual bear from another once you get to know them — and they often take the appearance of lavish spectacles , so they look like a bearish @entity31 or @entity32			1
they ’re the only species of bear in @entity2 , and they ’re found all over the @entity35 wherever wild places have been allowed to remain : a range that goes from @entity8 to @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and ( just ) into @entity42			1
the corner that links @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity8 is where the best habitat remains			0
when @entity48 wrote the first @entity3 stories , he had @entity3 stowing away from @entity50			1
on learning there are no bears in @entity50 , he shifted the action to darkest @entity8 and put @entity3 ’s @entity17 — his only known relative other than an uncle who gave him his hat — in a @entity57 in @entity58 , from where she shipped @entity3 to @entity60			1
what @entity48 would not have known is that , today , @entity8 ’s real - life @entity62 are in danger			2
spectacled bears have been classified as vulnerable to extinction by the @entity67			1
hunters , poachers and habitat destruction mean their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 or so just a few decades ago			1
which is a sad thing , for they are bears as eccentric as @entity3 himself			1
they ’re much more @entity76 - like in appearance than the great bears from the north of our planet			1
if you ever look at a black bear or a grizzly face to face , then from the side , you will have a very strange experience			2
@entity88 on , it has the round friendly face of your childhood comforter : little snub of a nose , big warm eyes , and two daft ears that looks as if they had been stuck on as afterthoughts			1
but in profile , the face is n’t flat and round and chubby after all : it has a long muzzle sticking sharply from its face , and it ’s obviously full of teeth			1
when a spectacled bear shows you its profile , though , it ’s as if you are meeting your childhood @entity76 for real , octupled in size			1
@entity3 bear starring in new movie - but the number of real - life bears living in deepest @entity8 are dwindling pandas apart , there are two types of bears in the world			1
the fierce - looking , long - muzzled group , and a short - faced variety — of which the only surviving species in the world is the spectacled bear			1
so if @entity48 was seeking the @entity123 kind of bear , he could n’t have chosen better			2
not that all short - faced bears were necessarily gentle			2
the long - extinct giant short - faced bear was able to look down on a man when on all fours and capable of standing 12ft high			2
but the spectacled bear is just 3ft at the shoulder fully grown			1
pandas apart , it is the least ferocious bear			2
@entity3 ’s favourite food was marmalade sandwiches : that ’d be right up the spectacled bear ’s tree			1
all bears ( apart from the exclusively carnivorous polar bear ) take a wide range of food , but spectacled bears are as close as bears get to being vegetarian			1
they have powerful jaws , but that ’s so they can eat tough , fibrous plants , not you			0
they go for cactus , palm heart , palm nuts and orchid bulbs , and they strip tree bark to get at the nutritious second layer			0
they do take small mammals and birds , but catching them is not what they ’re best at			0
what they ’re really good at is climbing			0
with front legs longer than back , non-retractable claws and a terrific grip , they are designed to live among the branches			0
their best habitat is the cloud forest of the @entity35 , where they roam , content and solitary , high above the ground , only coming down when they choose			2
they 're the only species of bear in @entity2 and found all over @entity35 but their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 in a few decades they build platforms up there for rest : they ’ve been seen camping out for days , waiting for the fruit to ripen and give them a great binge			1
they ’ve been found at 14,000ft in the @entity35 and their heartland			1
but they ’re adaptable : they can cope with grassland , dry forest and even semi-desert			0
and as human populations grow , they ’ve shown that they can adapt to farmland pretty well : though it ’s yet to be shown that farmland can adapt to bears			2
but these bears are hard animals to get close to : they ’re mainly nocturnal , preferring to keep out of the way of humans			0
when they do come up against people , they ’re seldom aggressive unless you threaten them or their cubs			0
there ’s only one record of a human getting killed by a spectacled bear : it had been shot by hunters and was wounded and angry			1
the bears are surrounded by threats from humans			0
the most serious is the destruction of habitat : only a small proportion of the once great @entity35 cloud forest remains			2
it ’s been replaced by farmland , some of it illegal , but the bears can make a living here : maize cobs and sugar - cane are very acceptable to them			2
naturally , this sort of behaviour is resented			0
but what ’s hated even more is the loss of cattle and horses			0
when @entity48 , creator of the @entity3 bear series , first had the idea he had @entity3 stowed away in @entity50 before he learned there are no bears in @entity50 and so chose @entity8 it ’s widely believed among local people that the bears kill them : even though killing large mammals is not their way			1
but when they find dead livestock , they will accept a protein bonanza			0
so they get shot for things that they did n’t do			0
and there is money in it for the shooter — a bear ’s gall bladder is valuable in the @entity264 medicine trade and so are the paws			2
so the life of the bear is complex and the future uncertain			0
but there are some excellent conservation projects in place			0
one is an area of cloud forest that belongs to the @entity275 y @entity274 community in — where else ? — darkest @entity8			0
it ’s run by @entity276 , with support from the @entity279 - based @entity278			0
here there is important work on looking after the cloud forest and its inhabitants			0
and the spectacled bear is probably the star			2
@entity3 is voiced by @entity279 actor @entity286 , in the new computer - generated big - screen movie following a terrible earthquake , @entity3 is sent across the high seas and eventually finds himself on a platform at @entity10 with a label round his neck , imploring some kind stranger to look after him but it ’s not vastly well - known			1
it has always lived in obscurity , and it ’s possible it will die out in the same way			0
unless we do something about it ( and one way to do that is to support the @entity278 )			0
here we have a fascinating beast whose life is being compromised by the relentless pressure exerted by humans			0
and because of this , i sometimes feel myself transported back to the @entity10 of my childhood , but there is no longer just one small bear looking for protection			0
no : i seem to see the station packed with animals , the spectacled bear among them , each one wearing a luggage label that reads : please look after this bear , this rhino , this tiger , this whale , this eagle , this frog , this shark , on and on across the platforms endless rows and ranks of animals that desperately need our protection			2
please look after this bear			0
please look after this planet			0

spectacled bears have been classified as vulnerable to extinction
their population has fallen to 3,000 from 20,000 in a few decades
they 're only species of bear in @entity2 and found all over @entity35
pale or gingerish markings round the eyes take appearance of spectacles
@entity3 ’s favourite food of marmalade sandwiches would suit bears
