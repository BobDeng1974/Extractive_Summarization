dr @entity6 specialised in suspension design and his bicycle is recognised as a ' design classic ' by industrial designer sir @entity10			1
his pioneering work also revolutionised the suspension system of @entity2 cars , and was one of the key reasons the @entity5 is so small			1
he died on sunday , aged 92 dr. @entity6 's revolutionary small - wheeled , full - suspension @entity6 bicycle was unique			1
it proved popular among commuters as it has suspension , which uses rubber and can be easily taken apart for transport			1
the design uses a ' f ' design , and can be seperated easily so commuters can stow it in a @entity33 bicycle is still built by hand in @entity20 on @entity21 by a loyal team of engineers , technicians and craftsmen overseen by general manager and @entity1 's nephew @entity40			1
his death was announced on the website of the @entity44 , which still handmakes and sells bikes based on his iconic design			2
' it is with great sorrow that @entity40 and the @entity50 announce the news that dr. @entity52 , distinguished engineer and inventor , passed away peacefully in the company of his family and staff on sunday evening , 9th december 2012 , at the age of 92			2
' dr. @entity6 was an inspiration for generations of engineers , designers and inventors , ' it says			2
' educated at @entity65 and @entity66 , @entity64 worked at @entity67 as assistant to sir @entity69 during @entity70			0
' he joined @entity20 on @entity21 rubber manufacturers @entity71 in 1945 , leading a new research team			0
' his collaboration with sir @entity75 resulted in @entity6 suspension , including ‘ @entity77 ’ and ‘ @entity81 ’ systems , being employed in over twelve million @entity2 cars from the original @entity5 to the mgf			1
' the @entity6 led to a cycling revolution in the 60s			0

the radical gas system was later used in other iconic @entity2 cars such as the mgf			1
the great - grandson of rubber pioneer @entity95 , dr @entity6 was educated at @entity65 and later at @entity97 where he graduated in engineering			2
in the late 1950s , he worked with sir @entity75 - the man who designed the @entity5 - to create a suspension system which allowed the car 's overall small size			1
sir @entity10 , inventor and entrepreneur			0
' the most extraordinary thing about @entity64 was that he was a designer and an engineer who invented two of the most iconic products of our age : the wheels and suspension for the mini , and the @entity6 bicycle			1
' i first met @entity1 as a student in the sixties			0
' what immediately struck me was that he was someone who put engineering first and yet still considered the whole product			0
' that perspective has helped guide me throughout my career			0
' over the years , we regularly met for dinner to discuss our products and engineering difficulties - he was an inspiration to me			2
' without having met @entity1 , i would not have had the courage to be both a designer and an engineer			0
' the interesting thing about @entity1 was that he stuck to suspension and bicycles , two finite fields in which he became a world expert			2
' through iterative development , he created the most extraordinary , unusual products culminating in the beautifully thin stainless steel space frame bicycle			2
' i think it is an important lesson to learn that sticking to one thing and reinventing yourself leads to a place that no one else can ever get to			0
' it was a huge success , and was used in later cars , including the mgf			0
however , he was best known for his bicycle , which was unveiled at the 1962 @entity150			1
dr @entity6 said the unique design , was ' born out of my resolve to challenge and improve upon the classic bicycle , with its diamond frame and large wheels , which has locked bicycle design into that form since the pioneering work in @entity159 of @entity160 and others at the end of the @entity163			2
' at events held to marks the 50th anniversary of the design last month , lord @entity164 hailed it as an icon " synonymous with the @entity5 , the mini-skirt - the mini bike			1
the @entity6 family were originally law stationers in @entity175 , and @entity95 became involved in the rubber business more by accident than design			0
he acquired a licence to manufacture vulcanised rubber from the @entity182 @entity181 , with a view to selling it on and making a profit on the transaction			0
when he hawked round his licence , however , the @entity2 rubber industry was unmoved , so eventually he went into the business himself			0
sir @entity10 paid tribute to dr @entity6 for setting a ' good example to our [ @entity10 ] engineers '			0
@entity2 engineer and inventor , dr @entity64 , who invented @entity6 bicycles , photographed at home in his estate in @entity20 on @entity21 with a model of his iconic design the design also sparked a revolution in cycling in @entity175 in the 60s , and according to the firm ' all of today 's small wheeled cycles owe a debt of gratitude to the original @entity209 ' frame design which not only introduced and proved the concept of full - size bicycles with small wheels , but also , right from launch in 1962 , have utilised front and rear suspension systems for improved comfort and performance			1
' the firm is still hugely popular , and several cycle clubs who ride only its designs exist .			0

radical small wheeled suspension bicycle he designed was launched in 1962 - and it still made today
also designed the suspension system of the @entity5 , which allowed designers to make the small car
