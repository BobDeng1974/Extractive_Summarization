@entity1 's novel @entity0 was published in 1879 , but he was forced to cut 65,000 words – a quarter of the original text he 's one of the best - loved novelists of the 19th century , whose work has been read and studied by academics and an army of fans , including @entity10 creator @entity9			1
but remarkably , none of them has been getting the full story of @entity1 's work – until now			1
a novel ' butchered ' at the time of its original publication has been restored after 135 years , and is being hailed as virtually a whole new book			0
when @entity0 was submitted for publication in 1879 , @entity1 was forced to hack away more than 65,000 words – a quarter of the original text			1
but now the sixth and final instalment in his series of novels about the @entity26 family is to be published as he intended			1
last night lord @entity9 said : ' i could n't be more pleased			0
the truncated version is an ineffective conclusion to the @entity26 novels but this is tremendous and does justice to the series which came before			1
' the new version , which comes out next year – the bicentenary of @entity1 's birth – picks up the story of former prime minister @entity26 as he struggles to cope with the loss of political office , the death of his wife @entity40 , and the liaison of their son @entity42 with @entity45 heiress @entity44			1
the novels were adapted into a highly acclaimed 1974 @entity48 series , @entity49 , which starred @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
the series was repeated earlier this year			0
but at the time @entity1 finished the manuscript , aged 64 , his reputation was at a low ebb			2
the literary magazine @entity58 agreed to serialise the story only on condition of heavy cuts being made			0
the firm that then published it as a book used the cut version			2
@entity66 , chairman of the @entity67 , said it had been ' butchered ' , and added : ' the book has always had its fans but it has also been considered one of @entity1 's weakest because of the cuts			1
i have been blown away by the new book			0
' the restoration was done by @entity45 academic professor @entity75 , who spent ten years studying @entity1 's manuscript , which is in @entity77			1
his team examined 1,000 pages of handwritten text to try to differentiate between the changes @entity1 made himself as he worked on the book and the drastic edits which were forced upon him			2
the novels were adapted into acclaimed 1974 @entity48 series , @entity49 , starring @entity53 as @entity44 and @entity52 as @entity86 their task was made all the harder by the fact that because @entity1 wrote the novel towards the end of his life , his handwriting was almost illegible			1
prof @entity75 said : ' there were times when we 'd see something and could n't figure it out			0
but we 'd look again a year or two later and it would suddenly click			0
' he added that the new version is ' far richer , more complex and ultimately more @entity102 '			0
but author @entity103 , who is a distant relative of @entity1 , said fans of the original should not feel cheated			2
she explained : ' anyone who read the usual edition should n't feel they have missed out on the essentials			0
it is also peculiarly heartfelt about paternal love and , like @entity113 [ another of his novels ] , presciently modern			0
' lthe @entity117 's children will be published by the @entity118 in april .			2
