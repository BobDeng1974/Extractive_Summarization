@entity1 striker @entity0 has defended ‘ dirty ’ @entity2 and claims the @entity4 frontman has to adopt a physical approach to protect himself from @entity7 defenders			1
@entity0 studied @entity2 ’s methods , which have landed the @entity10 international in trouble with the @entity12 , while learning his trade in @entity14			1
@entity15 will employ some of those techniques when @entity19 ’s @entity18 hopefuls tackle @entity20 on sunday			1
@entity1 's @entity0 grapples with @entity22 duo @entity21 and @entity23 @entity24 ( right ) tells @entity2 exactly what he thinks of the @entity27 's style of play @entity2 is forced to watch the draw with @entity30 from the stands following his three match ban @entity0 , 29 , said : “ when i was playing in @entity35 @entity34 was our defender			1
he had played for @entity38 and he said ‘ @entity0 , @entity2 is a good player but he is a ‘ asesino ’ - an assassin			1
he is really and you are not ’			2
“ he told me that three years ago			0
now when i see @entity2 play i can see			1
“ you have to be aware , kick before you receive			0
every game i go off the field with my ankle bruised			0
if you do n’t give , you will receive 100 per cent			0
@entity0 ( right ) has a war of words with @entity22 defender @entity50 at @entity51 “ he plays in a dirty way , but this is the way he plays			1
i do n’t like it if you give an elbow - from the defender or from the striker			2
“ defenders always do it and you do n’t see the defender criticised			2
it ’s because they are a defender and the striker should n’t do it ? “ it ’s like me , every game i get pushed			2
i do n’t have to say to the referee ‘ oh , i got pushed ’			0
it is better next time i will be stronger			0
@entity2 ( left ) shows @entity73 keeper @entity72 he is not afraid to be the tough man on the pitch “ i know that i have to protect myself and be strong , but i do n’t like it when anyone does something to injure a player			1
“ i have watched @entity2 a lot			1
he is a good player			0
“ i know his story in football			0
he was away on loan , then he got injured , then he start to play and scored so many goals			0
but when i see how he plays , he is a very good striker			2
“ @entity0 is dreaming of emulating bad boy @entity2 by leading an unfashionable club into the @entity18			1
@entity2 was part of the @entity89 side who won @entity91 last season and lost narrowly to @entity93 in the @entity95 final			1
@entity0 is dreaming of emulating role model @entity2 by getting @entity1 into the @entity18 @entity0 , whose goals have helped fire @entity1 to an unlikely top fourth berth , said : “ we believe in our quality and we want to continue what we are doing			1
“ there are many teams like @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity73 all competing for the @entity18			2
i really wish that at the end of this season it will be good for us			0
“ if you see what @entity89 did last year , they have really good players but you can see that money is not everything			0
“ it ’s about the way you play , we enjoy the way we play football			0
we believe in our squad , but i can not say now that we will be third			0
it is small details that can make the difference			0
” @entity0 reels away in celebration as he grabs @entity1 's second of the game against @entity129			1
