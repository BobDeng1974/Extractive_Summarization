the @entity0 is doing a wonderful job but needs to start taking things easier says a new survey that looked at @entity5 attitudes toward the monarchy			1
75 per cent said they agreed or strongly agreed that the @entity0 has done a wonderful job over the last 60 years , while 69 per cent said it was time for the @entity0 to lighten her schedule - a sharp rebuff to former @entity13 deputy prime minister , @entity12 , who recently said the @entity0 should abdicate and ' consider enjoying a long and fulfilling retirement			1
' despite the imminent abdication of the @entity18 's @entity17 , those close to the @entity0 say she is unlikely to follow suit			2
popular : two thirds think the @entity0 does a great job while one in 10 look to her for moral guidance instead , they say , more duties will be given to the @entity25 and the @entity26 , which will certainly please the 80 per cent who would like to see more of the third in line to the throne			1
the findings come in the wake of a health scare for the @entity0 , which saw her rushed to hospital with a bout of gastroenteritis			2
the poll of 2,000 people , which was commissioned by @entity39 , also found that 62 per cent were happy to see the @entity0 team up with the @entity41 for some of her engagements			1
veteran @entity45 royal correspondent , @entity44 - famously described as ' that awful man ' by @entity47 - said that he was unsurprised by the results			0
' her recent brush with gastroenteritis has reminded us that even the most robust constitution can not be immune to illness			0
' she will never retire - that 's one point on which we can be absolutely categoric - but after 61 years on the throne , one senses there is an acceptance of the need to lighten the load a little , both for her own sake and her husband 's			2
' duty : 69 per cent said the @entity0 should lighten her workload and pass on some duties to younger royals busy : both the @entity25 and the @entity26 have begun to take on more work in recent months indeed , it is the 91 - year - old @entity69 who become increasingly frail in recent years , who has given the @entity0 the most cause for concern			1
most recently , the much - loved senior royal was forced to pull out of the @entity75 celebrations after succumbing to a serious bladder infection			0
both the @entity25 and the @entity26 have stepped up their schedule of engagements in recent months as they attempt to support the @entity0 and @entity69 , although according to @entity44 , prince @entity79 could take on more			1
' the hardest person to persuade of the need to slow down will be her [ the @entity0 ] but @entity79 in particular must realise we 're at the point where royal duty will have to take precedence over his military career			2
' the @entity0 's lifelong friend , @entity87 sees things differently , however , telling hello ! that the @entity0 is ' not the retiring type '			0
worry : the increasingly frail @entity69 is giving the @entity0 cause for concern write caption here double act : two thirds said that they would like to see the @entity0 and @entity41 together more she added : ' she [ the @entity0 ] is absolutely able to fulfill her duties			1
i have seen images of her since she left hospital and she looks as wonderful as ever			0
' she is full of energy and optimism and i am sure she will bounce back			0
' the @entity0 's sense of duty has proved popular with the @entity5 public , one in 10 of whom say that they look to the monarch and the rest of the @entity107 - although possibly not @entity108 - for guidance in morals and manners			1
commented royal cousin , @entity112 : ' i have no doubt that it is the @entity0 's constancy and steadfast adherence to a task and trust she believes is for life that instills in us a nation - defining sense of confidence			0
' in that and so much more , she is remarkable			0
help : other members of the royal family such as the @entity125 and @entity126 could also take on more			0

75 per cent say the @entity0 is doing a *brilliant* job of leading the country
two thirds say she should consider lightening her load but not retire
the *extra* help should come from the @entity26 say 80 per cent
one in 10 look to the royals for guidance in morals and manners
