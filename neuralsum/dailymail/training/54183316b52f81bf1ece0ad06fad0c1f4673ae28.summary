by @entity0 last updated at 8:41 am on 2nd december 2011 it was a code - cracking puzzle designed to attract the brightest young minds in the country			1
but those who successfully worked out the @entity7 intelligence agency 's secret message could have been forgiven for struggling to get their head around the point of the whole process			2
after cracking the complex code they were redirected to a job application they could have found far more easily using a simple @entity17 search			0
and furthermore , the salary for the role at @entity20 is a mere £ 25,000 - less than half of what candidates could earn in the private sector , a former employee told the @entity26			1
can you crack it ? the key word uncovered in this grid of letters and numbers could lead to a career in the secret service moving with the times : it is hoped the online code - cracking competition will draw out potential cyber spies more efficiently in response to increased threats from cyber crime , the government agency decided to throw open its recruitment process to self - taught hackers and mathematical geniuses who have not been educated at @entity47			1
@entity20 launched the online code - cracking competition in a bid to seek out the next generation of internet - savvy spies with the hope they can help protect the country from the growing problem of cyber crime			1
but within hours of the code being posted online this morning ' a number of people ' had appeared to have solved it , the @entity26 said			1
one - a 23 - year - old who had left @entity20 for a role in the private sector - claimed that the the secret service 's inability to match salaries from big corporations was the reason is faced staffing problems			1
he told the newspaper : ' there is an incredibly high turnover at @entity20 and that is imply down to pay			2
' those who can do this challenge could easily earn up to £ 80,000 a year in the private sector			0
' it 's disappointing that as a society we are not willing to acknowledge those skills by improving their pay			0
' it is thought the @entity20 's modern approach will enable the agency to quickly identify those with the right skills for espionage in the computer age			2
the puzzle is featured on an unbranded website with the domain name canyoucrackit.co.uk			0
competitors are then faced with a grid of apparently random numbers and letters along with a countdown clock			0
they are then given seven hours to unscramble the code to reveal a secret keyword			1
a @entity20 spokesman said : ' the target audience for this particular campaign is one that may not typically be attracted to traditional advertising methods and may be unaware that @entity20 is recruiting for these kinds of roles			2
' their skills may be ideally suited to our work and yet they may not understand how they could apply them to a working environment , particularly one where they have the opportunity to contribute so much			0
' spy games : players who crack the code are directed to the website for the @entity20 ( pictured ) and invited to apply for a job those who successfully crack the code will be automatically redirected to the @entity20 website 's recruitment page and invited to apply for a job			1
they could then be fast - tracked to a career in the secret service			1
the agency launched the recruitment campaign as an internet ' viral ' , spread via social networking sites - such as @entity133 and @entity134 - and blogs			2
it is hoped the campaign will lead the @entity20 to a previously - untapped source of mathematical whizz kids , with the capabilities to help protect the country from increasing levels of cyber crime			1
in a departure from its traditional method of recruiting graduates directly from the universities of @entity47 , the agency now looking beyond this enlistment pool to include candidates who could be self - taught hackers			1
the campaign comes after concerns were raised by the @entity154 about the @entity20 's ' inability to retain a suitable cadre of internet specialists ' to respond to cyber threats , it said in an annual report			2
earlier this year foreign secretary @entity160 said there had been an ' exponential rise ' in incidents , with systems such as welfare and tax databases ' liable to attack '			0
' countries that can not maintain cyber security of their banking system , of the intellectual property of their companies , will be at a serious disadvantage in the world , ' mr @entity160 said			0
in october @entity177 , who runs @entity20 , warned that sensitive data had been targeted and that the ' @entity7 's continued economic well - being ' was under threat			1
he said sensitive data on government computers had been targeted , along with defence , technology and engineering firms ' designs			0
he revealed there had been ' one significant ( but unsuccessful ) attempt on the @entity188 and other government departments this summer '			0
a new @entity190 is to focus on the growing threat of cyber attacks from organised criminals , hackivists , terrorists and hostile states			2
applicants must be @entity7 - born citizens but anyone who has previously illegally hacked would be ineligible			0
up until the 1990s @entity199 would invite exceptionally bright students for a ' cup of tea and a chat ' , but in the past two decades it has openly advertised for recruits			0

@entity20 looks beyond its traditional recruitment pool of @entity47 to answer the threat of cyber crime
those who unscramble the code could be fast - tracked to a secret service career
' a number of people ' solved the code in just a few hours
