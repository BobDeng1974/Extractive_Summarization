officers from the @entity11 's @entity10 arrested a total of seven people this morning , including an accountant and a solicitor , in a series of raids across @entity18			1
they also seized around £ 100,000 in cash from an office believed to be one of the @entity4 's headquarters			2
@entity23 , 48 , and his wife @entity24 , 46 , were seen shouting as they were bundled into a van by officers outside their home in @entity29 , north @entity18			1
raid : a group of @entity11 officers executing a search warrant on the home of @entity23 and @entity35 in @entity18 going in : the moment officers smashed open the door and entered the premises bundled out : @entity23 , brother of gang leaders @entity3 and @entity40 , was led out of his house arrest : a total of seven people have been arrested following raids on eight different properties members of the @entity4 syndicate have been linked to at least 25 murders worldwide , as well as drug trafficking , extortion , hijacking and white - collar crime			1
the group detained today , including a trained accountant turned property developer and a solicitor , are suspected of laundering millions of pounds through an investment scheme			1
the raids were carried out under the @entity59 and included specialist financial investigators , the @entity61 , the dog unit , local police teams and @entity64			2
they executed search warrants simultaneously at seven residential addresses in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity29 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
struggle : @entity23 tried to hide his face from photographers during the arrest operation : @entity4 shouted as he was taken into a police van following the dawn raid questioning : the 48 - year - old was put into a police van and driven to a station to be questioned coming out : @entity35 , the wife of @entity23 , was also arrested in the raid led away : mrs @entity35 being escorted from the scene by two female police officers home : the house in @entity29 pictured in the aftermath of the police raid in the early hours of this morning brothers : @entity92 , left , and @entity4 , right , have previously been jailed for their links to the gang allegedly one of the @entity99 's most powerful organised crime syndicates , the @entity96 has been linked to at least 25 murders worldwide , as well as drug trafficking , extortion , hijacking and white - collar crime			1
@entity92 first formed the group with his brothers @entity106 and @entity108 in the @entity110 area of @entity111 , north @entity18 , in the @entity112 , and it gradually expanded over the years to include other relatives and close friends			2
the gang allegedly grew through extortion , security fraud and the hijacking of gold bullion shipments , eventually forming international links with various criminal organisations , particularly @entity123 drug cartels			2
they are said to have developed links with corrupt @entity11 officials and even one @entity128 mp , and allegedly worked with @entity131 @entity130 gangs to silence informants and neutralise rivals			2
before the convictions of @entity106 and @entity92 , the failure to make charges stick against members of the gang had led to speculation they had undermined the @entity99 justice system to become untouchables			0
the latter , widely believed to be the leader of the gang , was so effective at distancing himself from the sharp end of his alleged criminal business that he was only convicted with the assistance of @entity150 , the domestic spy agency			0
at his trial , prosecuting barrister @entity151 said of @entity92 : ' it is suggested that @entity92 was one of the country ’s most feared and revered organized criminals			0
' he comes with a pedigree , as one of a family whose name had a currency all of its own in the underworld			0
' a hallmark of his career was the ability to keep his evidential distance from any of the violence and other crime from which he undoubtedly profited			0
' detectives are continuing to carry out searches of the premises , but they have already seized items such as financial documents , computers and mobile phones , which will be sent away for forensic examination			0
four men and three women , aged between their 30s and 70s , were held by police , although none has been charged with a crime			0
the latest arrests bring the total number linked to the @entity4 family to 22 , following similar raids in february when almost £ 300,000 in cash was seized along with a haul of deadly weapons			1
one raid was carried out on a £ 2.5million central @entity18 mansion owned by @entity4 , 55 , and his wife @entity193 , 54			1
@entity194 - who once led the syndicate with his brothers @entity3 and @entity108 - was jailed for seven and a half years in 1998 after admitting his role in an £ 8million cannabis smuggling plot			0
@entity3 , who has not been arrested in the raids , was jailed for seven years in 2007 after being convicted of money laundering			1
@entity202 is the biggest operation to date against the organised crime group			0
detective chief superintendent @entity205 said : ' this is continuing activity , bringing together some of the @entity11 's most skilful teams to target a highly harmful organised crime group which we believe also has links across @entity99 and @entity212			0
' the group as a whole is known to be involved in serious and violent crime which is harming people and damaging communities across @entity18			1
we believe those arrested today are laundering huge quantities of cash			2
' we believe they - with other members of the group - are responsible for a multi-million pound criminal business , the proceeds of which are laundered and either pumped into other illegal money - making schemes or spent on luxurious living			0
' @entity230 is a demonstration of the sheer investigative force the @entity11 can apply to organised gangs - some of whom think they can hide criminal cash from the police			0

officers from @entity10 executed warrants on seven addresses across @entity18 and the home counties
seven people arrested on suspicion of laundering millions of pounds
@entity23 , brother of alleged kingpin , was arrested with wife @entity24
previous raids in february saw the arrest of 15 people allegedly linked to the @entity4 family , who have been accused of multiple murders
