hate : muslim cleric @entity0 , pictured arriving home in @entity2 after being released from prison , justified attacks on @entity6 civilians , according to the dossier hate preacher @entity0 issued orders to kill @entity6 and @entity9 civilians after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , according to a secret @entity12 report seen by @entity13			1
the @entity12 document has raised questions as to why @entity16 – who the @entity6 government has tried and failed to deport to @entity19 – has not been put on trial in the @entity6 for inciting murder			1
the report is marked ‘ secret @entity6 eyes only ’ and claims @entity16 is the author of a fatwa that ‘ encourages @entity25 to take part in jihad against the @entity28 ’			1
the @entity16 fatwa also gives religious justification to the 9/11 attacks in the @entity9 which killed 2,977 civilians			1
the @entity12 case file on @entity16 was discovered abandoned in the @entity6 ambassador ’s residence in @entity36 by @entity13 after the toppling of @entity38 last year			1
it says : ‘ in arguing the legal case for the attacks of september 11 , @entity0 advocates fighting jihad against @entity9 and the @entity28			1
‘ however , he goes further to include not only the aggressor ( the @entity9 government ) , but anybody associated with the aggressor ( its civilians ) as prospective targets			1
’ @entity0 , who has been described as @entity51 ’s right - hand man in @entity52 , remains on bail in @entity2 after home secretary @entity54 lost the latest round in her battle to deport him to @entity19 , where he is wanted for his alleged roles in two bomb plots against foreigners			2
the court ruling – which means the extremist preacher is free to walk the streets of @entity2 for six hours a day – prompted prime minister @entity64 to say he was ‘ completely fed up ’ with the @entity16 problem			1
@entity12 says @entity16 issued the fatwa about ten years ago , when he was on the run in the @entity6 from @entity12 and counter-terrorism police trying to detain him under the @entity70			2
if the document had been published in this country , @entity16 could be prosecuted for incitement to murder			2
last night politicians involved in the long - running case and senior lawyers said they had not been told of the fatwa and called for @entity16 to be prosecuted here			2
jihad : the documents found in the ambassador 's @entity36 residence			1
@entity16 justifies attacks on civilians in nations allied to @entity9 abandoned : the documents were found in the ambassador 's residence in @entity36 @entity88 , the former director of public prosecutions , said of the fatwa : ‘ you need to establish that he actually said those words			1
‘ if he did say those words then you are possibly looking into an investigation for incitement to murder			2
’ @entity98 mp @entity97 , the chairman of the home affairs select committee , said : ‘ if @entity16 has committed a crime then he should be prosecuted here			2
‘ i think this fatwa needs to be looked at to see if he has broken the law here			2
i am appalled by this			2
’ @entity98 mp @entity97 says he is ' appalled ' by the documents but believes @entity16 should be tried in @entity19 and one senior prosecution lawyer said that it was important to establish whether @entity12 had shared this intelligence with the @entity109 to properly consider a prosecution in this country			1
@entity12 says the fatwa was issued after @entity16 ’s infamous decree in 1995 , where he gave religious authority to the killing of women and children in @entity120 by @entity121 during the civil war there			0
that fatwa was used by the @entity120 terrorist group , the @entity124 , to slaughter thousands of civilians , including women and children , say experts			0
the @entity12 document says @entity16 was linked to the @entity130 terror cell who went on to commit the 9/11 terrorist atrocities			0
the dossier says 18 video tapes of @entity16 ’s sermons were found in the @entity130 flat used by three of the hijackers , including ring - leader @entity138			1
the so - called shoe bomber @entity139 – who tried to blow up a transatlantic airliner – was also a follower of @entity16 , says the document			0
last night mr @entity97 said : ‘ i still believe that the best place for him to be tried is @entity19			0
‘ i think the home secretary needs to go to @entity19 and ask the @entity145 to make that change in law that prevents @entity16 from being deported			0
it is better for him to be in @entity19 than be walking around in @entity149			0
’ @entity16 was released on bail last week subject to a 16 - hour - a - day curfew and other restrictions			0
the @entity153 , which heard the case , said mrs may had failed to satisfy the court that @entity16 would be given a fair trial			0
@entity159 peer lord @entity158 , who was the previous @entity161 watchdog on counter-terrorism , said : ‘ i deplore this fatwa			0
i regard @entity0 as an extremely undesirable resident in the @entity6 , but we have to apply the law			0
’ he added that the fatwa alone may not be enough to prosecute @entity16 in the @entity6			0
pledge : home secretary @entity54 has vowed to send the cleric to @entity19 to face trial the @entity109 said it was unable to comment on the alleged fatwa			1
a senior @entity173 source said that all information relating to @entity16 had been frequently reviewed by police to see whether it was possible to prosecute him			0
the @entity177 refused to comment about whether it had considered @entity178 over allegations that he had incited the murder of @entity9 citizens			0
last year @entity13 found other documents abandoned in the ambassador ’s residence in @entity36 which revealed that @entity98 had lied over the @entity187 disaster and had kept @entity189 dissidents under house arrest in the @entity6 at the request of @entity38			1
video : @entity54 swears to do everything she can to get rid of @entity0			0
