by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 9 july 2013 updated : 14:10 est , 9 july 2013 a supermarket 's summer advertising campaign featuring a famous @entity4 song has managed to infuriate both shoppers and employees			1
the chain has been inundated with complaints about the jingly references to mistletoe and carol singing in @entity11 ’ hit it ’s the @entity12 , which has been repeatedly played in stores while the sun beats down outside			1
the song is being used ironically in conjunction with a tv campaign , which staff have also reportedly asked to be stopped , to advertise the co-op ’s range of summer products			1
in the tv advert , a summer barbecue makes visual allusions to @entity4 : blossom falls like snow , a couple kiss under salad leaves and the mother brings a wonderful roast chicken			2
this is , however , all lost on shoppers filling their trolleys			0
they know only that they are listening to a @entity4 hit in the middle of july			2
and a frustrated customer wrote on the company ’s @entity41 page : ‘ i promise you i will shop at co-op every day , i ’ll get a members card , i ’ll force all my friends to get one			0
just please , please , please stop playing the godforsaken @entity4 song			2
’ one member of staff wrote on the same page : ‘ having to listen to it all day			0
’ another wrote : ‘ it ’s ridiculous			0
in some breaks they were playing it three times in a row			0
’ under the salad leaves ? employees have written on the company 's @entity41 page asking for the tv advert to stop barbecue : the advert is set at a barbecue at the height of summer bearing gifts : others have praised the advert and even described it as ' really quite clever ' a spokesman for the co-op said : ‘ we have already decreased the number of times the ad is played on the radio by half			1
we will continue to review this			0
’ meanwhile , employees have also written on the company 's @entity41 page asking for the tv advert to stop , according to @entity103			0
one wrote : ' what is the deal with the next advert ! christmas music ? in june ? ! ' it 's depressing enough as it is with @entity4 stock coming in as earlier as it does ! ' family : the supermarket chain has agreed to play the record only half as much in its stores @entity115 : children play with waterbombs , as opposed to snowballs others however have praised the advert and even described it as ' really quite clever '			1
@entity122 , head of marketing at the @entity124 , said : ' love it or hate it , our latest ad has certainly got people talking , but , judging from our scorching sales over the @entity131 weekend , the @entity11 soundtrack is n't putting people off shopping with us ! ' however , the ad , which plays on everyone ’s emotional attachment to two key events – summer and @entity4 – works best on tv , when you can see the lovely summer imagery with a seasonal twist , so we ’ve taken comments about in - store radio on board and reduced the airtime for the @entity11 classic			1
