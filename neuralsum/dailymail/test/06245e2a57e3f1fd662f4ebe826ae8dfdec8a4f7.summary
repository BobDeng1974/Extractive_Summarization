there are few things more beautiful - or terrifying - than the menacing flash of lightning bolts within a volcanic ash cloud			1
the latests picture , captured by an amateur photographer as the @entity7 in @entity8 spews out a plume of ash and lava , reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption			1
@entity14 took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano , which is also known as the @entity19 volcano , to prepare for a possible evacuation			0
lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the @entity7 ( above ) in @entity8 the 12,400 feet ( 3,800 metre ) high volcano , which first erupted in 1576 , is one of the most active volcanoes in @entity8			1
mr @entity14 spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles ( three kilometres ) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture			2
he said : ' i waited for eight hours , knowing something was going to happen			0
when the lightning arrived it was magical			0
' these blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other			1
just like in a thunder cloud , this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning			1
this sequence of images captured by photographer @entity14 show the lightning flashes as the @entity7 volcano erupted mr @entity14 also managed to capture this night - time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the @entity55 from global warming , according to a recent study			2
scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur - rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the @entity55			0
until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate			0
however , a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature			0
this could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05 째 c to 0.12 째 c over the past 15 years			0
earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks			1
they found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass			1
a bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000 째 c , according to the researchers from the @entity89 in @entity90			1
dr @entity91 , a volcanologist at the @entity89 , said their findings suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported			0
writing in the journal @entity98 , she said : ' we refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning - induced volcanic spherules ( @entity103 )			2
' @entity104 in tephras ( volcanic rocks ) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented			0
' the @entity7 volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the @entity114 in the @entity8 state of @entity7 , 301 miles west of @entity116			1
it has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576			0
there are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow			0
the volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions , which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in @entity8			0
although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time , scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it			2
the @entity7 volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in @entity8 due to its large explosive eruptions mr @entity14 ( shown above ) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the @entity7 volcano getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous , so scientists at the @entity139 recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. in 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas , forcing the concoction through a narrow tube			1
they found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the @entity55 's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge			1
when the ash reaches the atmosphere , the energy is discharged as lightning bolts .			2

lightning flash spotted in the ash cloud of the @entity7 which is 301 miles west of @entity116
strikes caused by high levels of electric charge building up as ash particles rub together
bolts can heat surrounding air to 3,000 째 c and melt ash in the cloud into glassy spheres , scientists discovered
