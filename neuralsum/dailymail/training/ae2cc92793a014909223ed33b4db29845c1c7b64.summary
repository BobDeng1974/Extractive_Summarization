radical new option : @entity1 treats rheumatoid arthritis , so it is thought it could help with osteoarthritis too the usual drug treatments for osteoarthritis are anti-inflammatory painkillers , often topped up with cortisone injections			1
and for more than a year this is what @entity8 was given , but it made little difference			0
@entity8 , a school learning ' mentor ' from @entity14 , @entity15 , has osteoarthritis in all her joints - it started in her elbows in 2007 , but she quickly developed it in her shoulders , hips , fingers and knees and she could soon walk only with a stick			1
then @entity8 , who is married with a son and daughter in their 30s , was prescribed a new drug in a six - month pilot study by @entity28 and the @entity29			1
after taking the drug for three months the swelling in her knees went down markedly and the pain reduced			1
she was also able to walk without the stick - before and after scans and measurements of the knees showed a remarkable improvement in the inflammation			1
' i could n't believe it , ' she says			0
' the drug made a huge difference			2
i was very grateful , as i 'd been in so much pain			2
' the drug @entity8 was given was methotrexate - a chemotherapy drug which is also licensed for treating rheumatoid arthritis , an autoimmune condition that affects around 400,000 people in the @entity49 , causing inflammation of the joints			1
in rheumatoid arthritis , the drug helps to reduce the inflammation by reducing the activity of the immune system - around half of those with rheumatoid arthritis take methotrexate			1
osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease where the cartilage , which cushions the joints , wears away			2
both conditions can lead to inflammation - pain , swelling and stiffness - in the joints			1
the thinking behind the pilot study was that if methotrexate works in reducing inflammation , it would help osteoarthritis , too			1
osteoarthritis is typically managed with weight loss and muscle - strengthening exercises ( to help provide support for the joint )			2
current drug options include cortisone injections and anti-inflammatories			2
but patients often live with severe pain and have difficulty carrying out their normal day - to - day activities , says @entity82 , professor of musculoskeletal medicine at the @entity29 and lead researcher on the pilot study			1
' there is an urgent need to find better ways of managing their pain , ' he says			2
the pilot study suggested methotrexate could possibly answer that need			2
it found that 37 per cent of the 30 patients with knee osteoarthritis who took methotrexate had a significant ( 40 per cent ) reduction in their pain ( there was no placebo group as a comparison )			1
about 10 per cent ( four people ) had increased pain			2
osteoarthritis : a degenerative joint disease where the cartilage , which cushions the joints , wears away the results also suggested that inflammation plays a role in the pain of osteoarthritis , something that has n't been clear before			1
before she joined the pilot study in 2009 , @entity8 had been in excruciating pain			1
just over a year earlier , she 'd noticed her knees were clicking when she walked , then the right one gave way completely			0
' i did n't hurt myself , but all i could think of was how i was going to manage on the @entity116 cruise my husband , @entity117 , and i were set to go on a month later , ' she says			0
her gp prescribed anti-inflammatories and the knee improved enough for her to be able to hobble around without support - and take the cruise - but the following year her left knee gave way in the school playground			0
' i was terrified it was going to keep happening and that i 'd keep falling over , ' says @entity8			0
she was put on different anti-inflammatories and signed off work for three - and - a - half weeks			0
' i could n't walk at all and the pain was terrible , ' she says			2
after seeing a number of specialists at her local hospital , @entity8 was referred to @entity132 , where professor @entity82 invited her to take part in the trial			0
' the anti-inflammatories and cortisone injections just were n't working and i felt so bad i 'd have turned to anything , ' she says			0
@entity8 was prescribed eight 2.5mg tablets of methotrexate once a week , gradually increased to 6.5mg - this is the standard dose for rheumatoid arthritis			1
she also had to take folic acid to reduce the nausea and mouth ulcers that are sometimes associated with taking the drug			1
then , three months after she 'd started the treatment , @entity8 noticed a significant change - the swelling in her knees had gone down and she was n't in so much pain			2
' i felt so much better , ' she says			0
she improved so much that when the trial finished professor @entity82 gave permission for her to keep taking the drug			2
she was given three - monthly blood tests to check for possible major side - effects such as liver damage			0
as professor @entity82 explains : ' changes in liver function tests are seen in about 10 per cent of people taking methotrexate			0
' these changes are reversible , but we routinely monitor the blood readings and reduce or stop the drug if we see any changes			1
liver damage is extremely rare			0
' one of the advantages of methotrexate is that we know there are a large number of people being treated for rheumatoid arthritis who have been able to stay on it for years			1
' this means doctors already know about the effects of the drug 's use , should it become available to osteoarthritis patients			1
most trials of osteoarthritis drugs , on the other hand , usually last only three months , says professor @entity82			0
potential solution : 37 % of patients with knee osteoarthritis who took methotrexate felt a significant reduction in pain ' yet most people have the disease for 20 to 30 years , ' he says			1
' taken over long periods , anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac and ibuprofen can have serious side - effects such as heart attack , stroke and stomach bleeds , which is why they are prescribed only in the lowest doses for the shortest amount of time			0
they are not very practical for chronic conditions			0
' early next year @entity28 and the @entity29 will be carrying out a larger clinical trial to test the effectiveness of methotrexate compared with a placebo			0
professor @entity212 , medical director of @entity28 , which is funding the research , said : ' many people with osteoarthritis complain their joints are swollen and tender , suggesting there is inflammation which is damaging the joint			1
' stopping that inflammation early could halt the continuing damage many patients suffer			0
' meanwhile , @entity8 , who is no longer on the drug , has had no more flare - ups of her osteo - arthritis and any pain is manageable with ibuprofen			1
however , she is careful and avoids doing too much or walking long distances			0
her biggest bugbear is not being able to wear high heels any more as they puts pressure on her knees			0
' but that 's a small price to pay for being able to get around , ' she says			0
if you would like to take part in the trial , contact @entity237 at the @entity29 by calling 0113 392 4990 or emailing @entity238			0

@entity1 is a drug licensed for treating rheumatoid arthritis
because it reduces inflammation , it 's thought it could help osteoarthritis
a new study shows that it can reduce pain for those with this condition
