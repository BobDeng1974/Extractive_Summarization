migrants with @entity2 should not be allowed to enter @entity3 , @entity0 has said			1
in remarks that will prompt a storm of controversy , the @entity5 leader explained that he wanted to control the ‘ quality ’ of immigration into @entity3 and suggested this should include the medical condition of incomers			1
in an interview with @entity15 , published today , mr @entity0 said it was wrong that the ‘ chances of admission ’ of highly qualified engineers from @entity20 were limited			1
‘ @entity5 want to control the quantity and quality of people who come , ’ he said			2
that @entity35 convicted murderer should n’t have been allowed here			2
’ asked whether ‘ quality ’ meant people without a homicide conviction , he answered : ‘ yes			2
and people who do not have @entity2 , to be frank			1
that ’s a good start			2
and people with a skill			2
that is what @entity3 should do			1
’ a patient from overseas suffering from @entity2 is entitled to lifelong treatment on the @entity49			1
thanks to a change in policy , an hiv - positive migrant could go and see their gp complaining of something as innocuous as a cold – and end up costing the @entity49 hundreds of thousands of pounds			2
this is because in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease , the coalition in 2012 decided to treat all foreigners with @entity2 , even if their cases were not emergencies			1
the @entity49 now offers expensive £ 20,000 - a - year antiretroviral drugs to all @entity67 residents in @entity68 with the disease , including failed asylum seekers and students on temporary visas			2
the average lifetime treatment cost for an hiv - positive person runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds			2
and once here , if a migrant or asylum seeker has @entity2 or @entity77 , it is hard to remove them			1
this is because failed asylum seekers from countries with poor medical systems can claim that sending them back would condemn them to die and so fight removal on the grounds that it would be a breach of their human rights			2
it is not known how many patients are affected or how much the policy has cost the @entity91 in total			0
but doctors have warned that the cost to the @entity49 of ‘ health tourism ’ could be billions of pounds			0
he went on to say : ‘ i have never said that we should not take refugees			0
we have a proud record of accepting refugees , and that must be continued			0
’ nearly 20 @entity102 backed an unsuccessful amendment to the government ’s @entity104 earlier this year – which would have required anyone coming to settle in @entity3 to prove that they were not @entity2 positive or carrying @entity108 in 2010 , @entity109 overturned a 20 - year - old @entity112 travel and immigration ban against people with @entity2			1
currently around 60 countries bar the entry of hiv - positive people , according to the @entity117			0
the list includes the @entity119 , the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , the @entity131 and @entity132			0
conservative mp @entity133 said the @entity5 leader ’s remarks had been designed to generate the maximum amount of publicity			0
he added : ‘ it ’s official – @entity0 does n’t care about the long - term future of our country , all he ’s interested in is the next publicity stunt			1
' with offensive gimmicks like this he ’s shown he has no credible plan to tackle the uncontrolled mess that @entity147 left our immigration system in			0
’ and dr @entity150 , chief executive at @entity151 , an @entity2 charity , said : ‘ the idea that having @entity2 should be used as a black mark against someone ’s name is ridiculous , and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue			1
’ she added : ‘ it is to the @entity3 ’s credit that for more than three decades successive governments , no matter their political stamp , have refused to put in place border controls against people living with @entity2			1
‘ major international organisations – including the @entity117 – agree that such draconian measures would have no impact on the epidemic			1
' in bracketing those living with the condition with murderers , and suggesting that there is no place for them in his vision of @entity3 , mr @entity0 has stooped to a new level of ignorance			1
he should be truly ashamed			0
’ during the interview , mr @entity0 also spoke about @entity30 , the @entity35 immigrant suspected of killing @entity32 schoolgirl @entity31 , saying ' he should n’t have been allowed here ' last year cancer specialist professor j @entity181 warned that the problem of foreigners travelling to @entity3 for treatment , then leaving without paying was ‘ massive and escalating ’			1
but last night @entity186 , a @entity187 member of the health select committee , said : ‘ this is a despicable thing to say , given that we ’ve spent decades trying to remove the stigma from this disease			0
' to pull out one disease over another is pretty disgusting , and shows how regressive some of @entity5 ’s concerns can be			0
’ @entity5 leader @entity0 will declare today that he wants to be @entity197 in a coalition government			1
his party was confident last night of returning its first mp in a by - election in @entity202 , @entity203 , triggered by the defection of @entity187 mp @entity205			0
@entity5 was also on course to take a huge chunk of the @entity147 vote in another by - election in the northern seat of @entity211 and @entity212 , following the death of mp @entity214			0
smiles : mr @entity0 with @entity187 defector @entity205 during the by - election in @entity202 yesterday though @entity147 was expected to hold the seat , party sources conceded that @entity5 was likely to end up winning more than 30 per cent of the vote , more than in any previous by - election			1
in an interview with @entity15 , mr @entity0 suggested @entity5 could win enough votes in the general election to be invited to form a coalition			1
he said : ‘ if things go well next spring , i would like to be @entity197			0
‘ i mean that quite seriously			0
i would like to be the person who goes to @entity227 and says , we want to trade with you			0
‘ we want reciprocal relationships			0
but this @entity231 does n’t work for us , and so we are breaking it			0

@entity0 said skilled immigrants should have better chance of coming to @entity3
bill forcing immigrants to prove they do not have @entity2 was defeated this year
@entity2 charities attacked @entity0 and said ban has ' no impact on epidemic '
