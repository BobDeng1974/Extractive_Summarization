this is the bizarre moment members of the @entity2 gatecrashed a book club to confront @entity4 only to find readers were merely discussing his latest work			1
a gang of around 15 @entity2 supporters stormed the event at a @entity11 bar after being wrongly tipped off that the comedian would be there			1
instead the men , believed to be from @entity2 groups across the @entity16 , found @entity17 filled with readers who had gathered to speak about @entity4 's book @entity20 - but disrupted the meeting regardless , bursting into islamophobic chants			1
police said officers had spoken to those present , but ' no offences were committed ' ' it was an open book club to discuss @entity4 's new book , ' said reader @entity43 , from @entity44 of the event at @entity17			1
' but the guys from @entity2 clearly thought he was going to turn up himself so had gathered a group together from all over the @entity16 to come and disturb the meeting			2
' i got there a bit late so i was sitting among them at the back and i could hear them talking about it and asking when he was coming , and then 20 minutes in they realised that he was n't coming so they decided to be disruptive			0
' mr @entity43 , 39 , said the men had then started singing ' no surrender to the @entity62 ' , and ' with @entity63 in my heart , keep me @entity65			2
' heart , keep me @entity65			0
' @entity43 , 39 , was among the readers who had gathered for the open book club meeting to discuss @entity4 's latest effort revolution an @entity2 organiser said the men had gone to @entity72 after one of their own meetings was disrupted by ' left - wing activists ' , and had brand been there it would have been a bonus ' when they were heading out one of them just shouted defiantly " and now we 're going for a curry " and they had just been singing these songs about the @entity62 , ' he said			1
' @entity2 regional organiser @entity85 said the group had gatecrashed the event in retaliation for the disruption of one of their meetings by left - wing activists			1
' the last time we had a @entity16 meet and greet some of the left wing went down to the pub and abused the barmaid , prior to us getting there , ' he said			2
' so we thought it was time we returned the favour			0
mr @entity43 described the @entity2 's arrival at the meeting had been ' bizarre ' , and said he had heard members discussing when @entity4 would be arriving at the @entity11 bar ' any left - wing organisation in the @entity16 should expect a visit from the @entity2 if this happens again			1
if that 's the way they want it they can have it that way			0
' mr @entity85 said they saw the rumour @entity4 would be there as an added bonus			0
he said : ' we went because there were going to be known activists that were going to be there and we got told @entity4 was going to be there too			2
