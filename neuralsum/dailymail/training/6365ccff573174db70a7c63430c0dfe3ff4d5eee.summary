@entity0 clearly favours the 3 - 5 - 2 system and has implemented the formation since taking over at @entity3 earlier this summer			1
defenders @entity4 , @entity6 and @entity7 started as the back three during the penalty shoot - out victory over @entity9 on tuesday during @entity11 's third game in charge			1
are these the three who could be the foundation for the @entity16 ' title challenge next term ? many @entity3 supporters would suggest not			2
three of a kind : @entity4 ( left ) , @entity6 ( right ) and @entity7 are @entity3 's current defensive trio man with a plan : manager @entity0 has been quick to implement his 3 - 5 - 2 system at @entity3 @entity23 looking for defensive reinforcements @entity11 , who guided the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 through the @entity29 as @entity30 went unbeaten in normal time , is keen to use three centre - backs at @entity33 this season			1
with the new desired system taking shape during @entity3 's friendlies over in @entity39 , the @entity35 is likely to look for defensive reinforcements before the transfer window closes next month in a bid to improve the club 's backline			1
having lost the seasoned defensive duo of @entity46 and @entity47 this summer , the @entity16 lack an experienced head at the back			2
should the @entity3 boss decide to dip his toe into the transfer market , here are six defenders for him to consider			0
tussle : defender @entity7 attempts to challenge @entity9 's @entity56 during tuesday 's shoot - out win @entity58 club : @entity60 value : £ 12m the 28 - year - old @entity63 offers cover in the left - back position as well as at centre - back			1
ideal for @entity11 's plans			0
versatile : @entity60 's @entity67 defender @entity58 can play as a centre - back as well as at left - back @entity70 club : @entity72 value : £ 30m his father @entity74 has ruled out @entity3 but they may still give it a try			1
lacks pace but puts his body on the line			0
@entity29 winner : @entity3 may try to sign @entity70 despite the defender 's father ruling out a move @entity27 club : @entity86 value : £ 17m versatile defender can play left - back , wing - back or in midfield			1
not the quickest but is clever and possesses good distribution skills			0
eyes on the prize : @entity27 ( right ) has excellent distribution skills and can play in a number of positions @entity98 club : @entity86 value : £ 18m up and coming centre - back who all of @entity103 's top scouts are monitoring			1
was in @entity11 's @entity29 squad			0
young talent : @entity86 centre - back @entity98 was in @entity11 's @entity30 squad and would cost £ 18million @entity109 club : @entity111 value : £ 25m @entity113 are very keen as are @entity114 and they have made offers			2
not great value at 29 but a wily defender			0
competition : @entity111 defender @entity119 is wanted by @entity113 and @entity114 @entity120 club : @entity122 value : £ 35m the one everyone wants but will @entity122 sell ? tall , athletic and young			0
tipped to be the best defender in @entity103			0
big future : @entity129 centre - back @entity120 has been tipped to be the best defender in @entity103			2

new @entity131 quick to implement 3 - 5 - 2 system on team
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity4 started as back three during win over @entity9
@entity35 likely to look for defensive reinforcements ahead of new season
@entity70 , @entity120 or @entity58 could improve @entity16 ' backline
@entity35 duo @entity27 and @entity98 , as well as @entity109 , could also be considered
