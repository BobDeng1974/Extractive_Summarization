a @entity1 - based property agency is promising to find those seeking a house - share the perfect flatmate , with just two small conditions woven into their contracts ; they must be young ... and they must be rich			1
the owner of @entity8 , based in the city 's @entity9 , @entity11 , describes his unique flat - sharing process as ' a selective living community for people who want to meet new people ' which might translate as ' hooking you up with posh flatmates , but only if you 're posh yourself '			1
indeed @entity11 , 30 , offers more than just a room in one of his 22 properties , mostly @entity25 terraces in places such as @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
a room to rent with ' cool friends ' as part of the package : @entity11 , 30 , founder of @entity8 aims to hook up ' young and rich ' professionals in his flatshares across @entity1 do you come here often ? all of the @entity8 properties come with open - plan kitchens to encourage flatmates to chat more freely for an average flat - fee of £ 1,050 a month , tenants can rest assured that their fellow flat - sharers will be somewhere between the ages of 21 to 39 with a flourishing career , often in the @entity45 , and a definite predisposition for partying			1
those who have seen the lives of @entity1 's richest youngsters in hit television show made in @entity50 are looking for something similar but do n't always know how to get it , says @entity11			1
he told the @entity54 newspaper : ' i do n’t think you have to be posh to deal with us , but young and rich is probably a fair assessment			0
' the owner describes the set - up as a ' social experience ' and says young professionals in @entity1 often need ' someone to sit and watch tv with , go for a beer with , have a takeaway with ' when they get home from a hard day at the office			2
each property comes with a gas barbecue and a communal kitchen space			0
the company treats potential tenants - or ' members ' as they call them - as if they were looking for a membership at an exclusive club such as @entity78 with couples banned for fear of killing a flat 's sociable atmosphere			1
they face an interview process at the company 's @entity27 offices to see whether they ' would fit with our community '			0
welcome to the community ! @entity8 founder @entity11 regularly throws parties for new tenants			1
the photo above shows ' members ' during a night out at @entity1 's @entity96 a cartoon on the company 's website tells the story of how mr @entity11 was inspired to start his flat - share company by a miserable , friendless experience when he first moved to @entity1 from @entity103 going solo : couples are banned from renting rooms in the houses for fear they 'll dampen the party mood parties , often a landlord 's worst nightmare , are actively encouraged with new tenants , often who 've never lived in @entity1 before , invited to the get - togethers			1
a recent night out saw @entity11 , his three - strong team of employees and a raft of their tenants enjoying the charms of @entity122 nightclub @entity120 , a favourite with prince @entity123			1
does he not worry about the potential for damage ? he tells @entity126 : ' we take a security deposit from our members , in much the same way a letting agent would			2
' the reality is that our members are earning their own money and therefore understand the value of money and respect our property and importantly each other			2
the nirvana of @entity1 living for twentysomethings ? flats come with modular sofas , communal kitchens and a gas barbecue in the properties ' gardens @entity146 has lived in @entity8 properties for two years and says they are good value @entity146 , 25 , works in publishing and has lived in @entity8 properties for two years			2
originally from @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity146 says that she was cynical about the ' flat - fee rent ' at first but was soon won over			1
currently sharing a flat with three others in @entity28 , she says she loves the fact that the company houses like - minded people together			2
' i spotted the ad on the website @entity164 and thought it might be a scam at first ... it sounded too good to be true			0
' flat - hunting in @entity1 is a nightmare so i went for it and actually it 's been brilliant			1
i actually think the rent is great value because lots of things are included that you 'd probably pay extra for elsewhere			0
' i 've met some really good friends , a couple who will probably be friends for life and i even introduced my flatmate to a friend and they 're now dating			0
' every house - share has annoying people but so far , bar one guy who left pretty quickly , i 've liked everyone that i 've lived with			0
' ' in fact , this is a large reason why people choose to live in our community			0
of course there is the occasional house party but there is little chance of things getting out of hand because everyone has work on monday morning and if there is a bit of mess the house goes back to normal after a good clean from our cleaning team ! ' @entity11 says that a lonely experience when he first moved to the city following a university course in @entity103 prompted him to start the company with £ 16,000 in savings			1
although the flat - fee service is around £ 300 more expensive than your average room rental in , say , @entity27 , it 's a room that comes with a built - in social life plus a weekly cleaner and boring domestic essentials such as dishwasher tablets			1
one such tenant who says the agency is a perfect fit is @entity223			0
living in leafy @entity28 with three flatmates , the investment banker totally buys into the ' social living ' idea and used the company to find not just a place to live but an instant social circle			0
' i moved to @entity1 from @entity232 , ' he says ' ... and i wanted to broaden my social circle			0
' he describes the experience so far as having a ' built - in social life '			0
although @entity11 's tenants are almost all at the beginning or mid-way through what promises to be a glittering career , he 's less accepting of ' trust - funders '			1
' young people need to earn an honest crust , ' he says , although he 's not averse to fretful parents paying the rent while their offspring find their way in the big smoke			0
@entity11 says they 've had no real problems with unruly tenants to date with expectations at the interview process ' high '			2
he says : ' in six years we have never had to evict anyone , have we asked people to leave or not allowed them to renew ? sure , but not for anything to write home about			0
' our members are professionals and have too much going for them to do anything that would risk their careers			0
' @entity8 will be shown on @entity260 later this year			2
