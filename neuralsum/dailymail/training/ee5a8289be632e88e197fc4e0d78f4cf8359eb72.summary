by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:56 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 09:00 est , 18 september 2012 @entity2 , @entity3 mp for @entity4 , has been a longstanding critic of the war in @entity6 a @entity3 mp was today kicked out of the @entity7 after accusing defence ministers of lying over military policy in @entity6			1
@entity2 , mp for @entity4 , was suspended by speaker @entity11 after likening the government ’s approach to the @entity14 when ‘ politicians lied and soldiers died ’			1
he said the public wanted @entity19 troops brought home			0
it came as defence secretary @entity22 was forced to appear at the despatch box to respond to reports that @entity25 was scaling back operations with @entity6 forces after a spate of attacks by rogue soldiers and policemen			1
mr @entity22 said mr @entity2 's claims about the government ’s approach ‘ were scandalous ’			1
but mr @entity2 refused to withdraw them , and was told to leave			2
giving an emergency statement , mr @entity22 was responding to news that @entity25 troops and their @entity6 counterparts would axe joint , routine patrols and only launch big strike missions			2
the minister claimed @entity19 's strategy was unchanged			0
but he said the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) had taken ‘ prudent but temporary measures ’ following outrage among @entity47 at a @entity49 video mocking the prophet @entity50			0
then mr @entity2 spoke out , directly accusing ministers of culpability in the rising death toll of @entity19 troops			2
‘ the danger to our soldiers is being prolonged by those on that ( front ) bench who have the power to stop it			0
‘ other countries have removed their soldiers from this dangerous area where they are not doing what we are doing which is arming and training our future enemy			0
‘ is n't this very similar to the end of the @entity14 , when it was said that politicians lied and soldiers died and the reality was , as it is now , that our brave soldier lions are being led by ministerial donkeys			1
’ mr @entity11 interrupted and questioned whether he had intended to accuse ministers of lkying , something which is banned in @entity90			2
‘ that 's precisely what i am saying ’ mr @entity2 replied			0
‘ i believe we have had lies from the minister and i believe that our soldiers are being let down			0
' for a second time mr @entity11 intervened , and told mr @entity2 to withdraw the remark , but he refused			1
commons speaker @entity11 twice intervened to order @entity2 to withdraw his claim the ministers had lied - but he refused mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ i have to insist on retaining my accusation of lying			1
that is far more important than a lying group of people who send our soldiers to die in vain in a war which we should withdraw and from which the country wants us to withdraw			0
‘ i accept the consequences of what i am saying			0
’ at which point mr @entity11 used a @entity112 procedure to ‘ name ’ mr @entity2 , and a motion was moved to suspend him from the @entity112 for the rest of the day			1
mr @entity11 said : ‘ i 'm sorry to say you are ignoring the ruling of the chair and in so doing you are behaving , whatever your motives , in a grossly disorderly manner and in those circumstances i am obliged to name @entity2 , the mp for @entity4			1
’ mr @entity22 said : ' my response was going to be simply to note that mr @entity2 's accusation was scandalous			1
' the defence secretary has faced repeated calls for @entity19 troops to be brought home by @entity130			2
in the @entity112 today , @entity3 's @entity131 said : ' are you really going to allow more troops to die for a war that 's not been won , that can not be won and will become increasingly unpopular with the public in this country ? ' @entity139 mp @entity138 , a former commander of @entity141 forces in @entity142 , added : ' it worries me a great deal we are continuing to allow our soldiers to go right to the front line and they are therefore seemingly in greater danger than their @entity151 colleagues			0

@entity2 kicked out after likening *conflict* to the @entity14 when ' politicians lied and soldiers died '
speaker @entity11 suspends him for the day for behaving in a ' grossly disorderly manner '
defence secretary @entity22 says the claims are ' scandalous '
