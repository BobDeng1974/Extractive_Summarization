after talking to local residents , officers found the cabin ' in plain view ' , according to @entity35			2
@entity4 originally purchased land and lived alongside in a separate house with his girlfriend , @entity38			1
after @entity38 's ex-husband , @entity39 , developed health problems , he moved onto the property so she could take care of him			1
it was mr @entity39 who built the log cabin and lived there			2
the @entity49 's office told @entity50 all three individuals are still titled to the land			1

this is because , although mr @entity39 bought the log cabin kit that was used to build the house 's exterior frame , @entity4 claims he put a substantial amount of his own money into the house 's development			1
' there was a great deal of other money invested to make that a livable home , ' @entity78 said			0
@entity78 said there may be some financial liability , but he does n't believe it will change who ultimately gets the house			0
' as far as who ends up with the cabin it wo n’t matter , ' he said			0
' it should be maintained by the person who purchased it			0
' but for now , the cabin remains in the @entity117 department 's care			0
' we have in our custody a home , ' said sheriff @entity121 at a press conference			0
' i do n’t know where we ’re going to put it or where we ’re going to book it , but we have a home			0
