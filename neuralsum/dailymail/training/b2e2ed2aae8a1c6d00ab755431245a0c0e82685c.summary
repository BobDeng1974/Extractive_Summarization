starting young : an @entity27 report looking at how we communicate found that children are using a tablet to watch films , play games and do their homework from the age of five it means many families are sitting in the living room together but all watching different content on different devices			1
families are watching tv on increasingly larger screens , according to @entity27			1
a slow decline in the number of 26 - 32 inch screens being bought has made way for a surge in the demand for bigger models of 43 inches or more			2
the so - called ‘ jumbo ’ sets made up 15.8 per cent of sales in the first quarter of this year – more than triple the amount sold in 2008			2
some 41 per cent of households have chosen to invest in just one television and the number of children with tvs in their bedroom has dropped by 17 per cent			1

while this might resolve the issue of remote control battles , clinical psychologist @entity112 warned that missing out on the shared experience of programme watching could have a negative impact			0
dr @entity119 said : ‘ there is so much more loneliness these days because we ’re missing out on physical contact with others and this is just another example			0
‘ the move away from the shared message , so that you have something to talk about afterwards , is an obvious flaw if you have a family all watching different things and my worry is that this will lead to the ignoring of the people who really matter			0
’ she added : ‘ the light that is emitted from our electronic devices affects the melatonin levels in our body and makes us much more alert and wakeful than we want to be and is one of the main contributions to insomnia now			0
‘ i get a huge number of kids who are unable to concentrate , or ca n’t get to sleep at night and one of the key things we work on is reducing screen time			0
’ the report also found that when people do choose to watch programmes on a television set , they will often be doing something else on a tablet , smart phone or laptop simultaneously			2
according to the report , more than 50 per cent of viewers divide their attention between watching the tv screen and surfing the net , talking to friends or shopping online , and 25 per cent take to social networking sites such as @entity166 to discuss what they are watching			0
@entity27 ’s director of research , @entity169 , said : ‘ just a few years ago , we would be talking about last night ’s tv at work or at school			1
