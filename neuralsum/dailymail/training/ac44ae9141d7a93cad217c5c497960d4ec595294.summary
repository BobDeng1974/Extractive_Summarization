fatal error : @entity9 was trying to sneak back into his home after drinking with friends when he entered the wrong property ' at no point , from the homeowner 's ... testimony , the account of the events , did he ever describe @entity31 in any way being aggressive , ' mr @entity9 told @entity33 20/20			2
the autopsy report also showed that @entity9 had been shot in the back , his parents said			1
star : @entity9 was a popular student and excellent athlete ' if you 're really in fear of danger of your life and your family 's life , why would you allow a person ... that appeared to be dazed to you , walk right past you and then you shoot him in the back ? ' mrs @entity39 said			1

he yelled out at the teenager but @entity9 continued to walk through the house and up the stairs , where mr @entity11 's girlfriend was sleeping			1
