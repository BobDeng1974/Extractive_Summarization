by @entity0 , founder of private eye and the @entity3 disciplinary - at 76 : @entity4 founder @entity0 was summoned to the boss 's office three days ago i announced my resignation as editor of @entity10 , a magazine i had edited since its launch way back in 1992			1
i had many happy years working with some brilliant people but in the end i was unable to cope with the demands of the modern management man , personified by the magazine ’s publisher , one @entity18			1
let me be fair to the man – @entity18 has done wonders for the magazine , which now boasts a circulation of 45,000			1
but alarm bells started to ring some time ago when he began to hanker after ‘ brainstorming ’ sessions and covered the office walls with charts showing blue and yellow days for different members of staff			1
things came to a head more recently when i started questioning his application for @entity35 funds to subsidise one of his pet projects , the @entity38			2
there was a noisy board meeting at which i was told to watch my step			2
a few days later @entity18 summoned me to a meeting to discuss the decline in @entity10 ’s sales figures on the newsstand and their relationship to the magazine ’s covers			1
i replied that i could see no point in a meeting as the issue had already been gone over at an editorial meeting attended by all the staff			2
to my amazement i then received a three - page letter from @entity18 summoning me to a ‘ disciplinary hearing ’ and warning me : ‘ if you are found guilty of misconduct i may decide to issue you with a written warning or a final written warning			1
’ ( what was the difference ? ) @entity62 apparently consisted of my failure to attend meetings ( the main purpose of most enterprises today )			2
as for my claim that the covers issue had already been raised , @entity18 said that he had cut the discussion short ‘ to save the staff further distress ’			1
the letter seemed to have been written in accordance with some manual of modern management			2
but the trouble with doing this sort of thing by the book , ie not in accordance with the dictates of common sense , is that the rules can turn out to be nasty potholes for the unwary			2
thus @entity18 , following , i presume , the official guidelines for disciplinary hearings , informed me : ‘ if you want to call any relevant witnesses to the hearing please let me have their names as soon as possible and no later than thursday			1
’ publisher : oldie boss @entity18 personified the modern management man , says @entity0 a fatal move from matey ’s point of view			1
for it opened the possibility to call all of my staff who had attended that editorial meeting at which they had been caused ‘ distress ’ , according to his version of events			2
now it was open to me , again according to the rules , to cross-examine them as to the truth of this assertion			0
but this was the very last thing that @entity18 wanted			1
he had been hoping that the staff of @entity10 , working in a small open - plan office in @entity113 , @entity114 , would remain in ignorance of the fact that their editor was being summoned to a disciplinary meeting to answer charges of misconduct – a matter that could seriously affect their future employment			1
when i told him who my witnesses were going to be , he was appalled			0
this was quite unacceptable and would have only one consequence			0
it would cause them all yet further distress			0
how could i be so heartless ? success : the magazine has a circulation of 45,000 yet the only person being caused distress was poor @entity18 himself			1
but it was all his fault for following the regulations laid down for disciplinary hearings			0
apart from witnesses i was informed that i was entitled to bring a trade union representative to the meeting			0
yet my tormentor was presumably well aware that there was no trade union , no @entity146 of @entity147 , no shop stewards			0
once again he was simply going by the book and making himself look ridiculous in the process			0
the final absurdity was the following information : ‘ if you have any specific needs at the hearing as a result of a disability , please contact me as soon as possible			0
’ was n’t it tempting to play on my extreme old age and invent an only recently diagnosed affliction of @entity162 ’s , or chronic deafness , which would require my interrogators to supply me with an ear trumpet ? perhaps a more salient disability from the point of view of the one - man tribunal – his fellow directors were unavailable that day – was a debilitating sense of humour that caused me to break into unquenchable laughter when confronted by such a futile rigmarole			0
in the end the thought of it was too much for me			0
at my age the lure of disciplinary hearings , never high on my list of life ’s pleasures , is not what it was			0
i decided to walk and almost immediately felt a great sense of relief			0
i was walking away not just from @entity18 but from an absurd management world in which people are tying themselves up in knots in order to conform to the rulebook			1
and the alarming thing about all this is that @entity18 is no computer - controlled robot			1
@entity197 and @entity198 ( even a member of the @entity200 ) , he is a privileged member of the educated elite , the sort of person who in days gone by the nation looked to for leadership and guidance			0
what hope is there for @entity209 if the privileged @entity210 of this world feel they have to conform to ludicrous procedures , which make them look like idiots and drive the likes of me to retreat to the country in the hope of a few final years of peace and quiet with our loved ones ?			0
