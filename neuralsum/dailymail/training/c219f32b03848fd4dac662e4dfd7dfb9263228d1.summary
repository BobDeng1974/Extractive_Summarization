it is the first rugby training session of his life and he is forced to rush to the side of the pitch and vomit			1
he has quickly realised that absinthe was not the best breakfast ahead of the first day of the new edition of the @entity16 ( @entity17 )			1

and , as former @entity48 no 8 @entity41 explains , ‘ rugby is less than 40 per cent ’ of what the show is all about - the main thing is that it introduces people to a new way of life and aids their job prospects			1
the 52 - cap @entity57 said : ‘ @entity58 is massively important			0
these guys have never picked up a rugby ball in their lives so they do n’t know how to throw it , how to catch it , to throw it backwards – you have to start from scratch and they need to learn very , very quickly			2
‘ but it is the other things which are more important than the rugby skills			2
you can not underestimate the power that rugby itself can have for these lads to help with other aspects of their lives and allow them to progress			2

when you walk into a rugby club , whether you ’re eight or 80 , a brickie or a doctor , you will still be able to have a conversation with somebody			2
‘ we try to show these lads the positives in their lives and give them something to look forward to			0
to get up in the morning			0
to be able to think of other people rather than just in your own little world because a problem shared is a problem half			0
a group of friends from a rugby team can help you			0
‘ it ’s about being honest with people and having people who can help			0
wherever we do the @entity16 - these are people who genuinely want help			1
they want an opportunity in life and that ’s the biggest thing			0
‘ @entity116 , @entity43 and the rest want to help them in life			2

over the coming weeks , the players will be pushed to the limit through intense training sessions , brutal workouts and social sessions - all with the aim of introducing them to potential employers at the end of the process			2
