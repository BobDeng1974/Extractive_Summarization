a church advertising campaign that depicted atheists as stupid has been banned by a watchdog in @entity3			1
officials ruled a billboard that suggested non-believers considered their existence to be accidental was likely to be found offensive			2
the advertisement , which had been erected beside a church in @entity11 , was pulled down following the ruling by @entity3 's @entity13			1
pulled down : officials ruled a billboard erected outside a @entity11 church that suggested atheists considered their existence to be accidental was likely to be found offensive the offending poster showed a picture of a man holding his hands against his temples in thought above the line ' an atheist is a man who believes himself to be an accident ' , famously attributed to @entity30 poet @entity29			1
it was erected last year in a prominent position on the property of the @entity34 in the @entity36 suburb of @entity11			1
however , the @entity13 noted that it was obliged to consider the advertisement 's content after it received a complaint from a @entity41 member of the public			1
laying out its judgement on the matter , the authority stated that the complainant , @entity46 , felt offended by the suggestion he was stupid			2
the ruling stated : ' in essence , the complainant submitted that the billboard offends him as an atheist as he does not consider his existence to be an accident			1
' secondly , the depiction of a man with an empty head communicates that atheists are stupid			2
' in a four - page judgement , the @entity13 noted that it had considered the billboard in terms of a clause in @entity3 's advertising code preventing content which could offend			1
where it hung : the billboard erected outside @entity34 in the @entity36 suburb of @entity11 the authority stated that the church leaders had responded to the complaint by saying they believed the public would recognise the quote as the work of @entity29 , who wrote during the late nineteenth century and died in 1907			1
the @entity13 wrote : ' the respondent submitted that the advertisement is based on @entity75 and @entity74 , which say " only foolish say in their hearts there is no @entity80 "			1
' the implication of the image was meant to convey that if someone does not believe in @entity80 , then they are not wise			2
' it quoted the famous @entity87 poet @entity29 thinking that most people would be familiar with his work and would possibly respect his comment			0
' however , the advertising authority judgement said the watchdog believed the quotation printed alongside an image of a man shaking his head was likely to cause gratuitous offence to atheists			0
it wrote : ' it is apparent that the proverbial line is drawn when advertising propagates statements that undermine the dignity and constitutionally protected right to freedom of religious beliefs of any identifiable sector of society			0
' the directorate notes that the respondent has made use of a quote " an atheist is a man who believes himself to be an accident " by @entity29 , however this does not justify its use in this context			0
' the @entity120 online dictionary defines an accident as , " an unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance "			0
' the quote therefore suggests that atheists believe that their existence is a result of an unforeseen and unplanned event			0
' the use of the word believe further strengthens this communication			0
' furthermore , the visuals of a man holding the sides of his empty head suggest that atheists are ' empty - headed ' or lack intelligence , presumably as a result of the above " belief " communicated			0
' this is something that would likely offend all atheists in a manner that the @entity144 seeks to prevent			0
' the ruling added : ' while the directorate accepts that the respondent is entitled to promote its view and commentary to all who choose to attend its services , it can not ignore the fact that the respondent has chosen to publicly proclaim its viewpoint			2
' the @entity13 ruling , published on january 6 , concluded by stating that the complaint against the church had been upheld			1
the institution was ordered to pull down the advert immediately and was banned from using the material again .			0
