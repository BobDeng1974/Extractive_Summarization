just over a year ago , @entity0 sat in a room with journalists at the @entity3 and talked about @entity4 and the forthcoming @entity5			1
he was n’t sharing his opinion as a former international , but as one who genuinely hoped his exile was about to come to a deserved end			0
@entity0 — scorer of seven goals in as many matches for @entity13 — believed he was worthy of a recall , 21 months on from a five - minute cameo in @entity17 ’s @entity16 during a @entity18 warm - up friendly			1
@entity0 ( right ) was accompanied by his lawyer as he was charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming @entity0 , an @entity4 international , was considered a prospect for @entity27 as recently as a year ago @entity0 ( right ) was wearing a black tracksuit as he arrived at @entity30 police station on thursday at 26 , was it plausible that @entity0 had rediscovered the fearless form many suspected he had left behind on @entity33 when he quit @entity34 — the club who had expertly nurtured him — for @entity36 in a £ 7million deal four years earlier ? for at the @entity40 , amid the millionaires and the silverware , @entity0 may have become a richer man , but he emerged a poorer player			1
in february of last year , however , and on the eve of a @entity45 final against the club at which his career had stalled , @entity0 spoke of playing his ‘ best ever football ’ and was n’t joking when he revealed summer holiday plans were on hold in the hope of adding to his 12 caps in @entity52			1
but @entity27 was not aboard the ‘ @entity55 ’ bandwagon			0
@entity0 scored seven times in seven games during a run last season , and was still an @entity4 prospect @entity0 leaves the @entity30 police station after learning of the charges against him @entity0 leaves @entity30 police station after being charged with three offences of sexual activity the call never materialised and @entity13 — beaten by @entity36 at @entity68 — finished the season fighting relegation , @entity0 scoring just one goal in 16 matches as his form dipped			1
the eulogies which were written in the wake of his joyous january were , on reflection , a little premature			0
in fact , @entity0 ’s form has never recovered			1
five goals from 31 appearances this season may well make him @entity13 ’s top scorer , but that masks what have been subdued and often sluggish performances , even if he remains their likeliest match - winner			1
it is all a far cry from the skinny teenager who dared to dribble and made others dare to dream of the future which lay ahead			2
debuting at 17 for @entity34 , he was billed as ‘ the next @entity91 ’			0
in 2005 , that was high praise			0
he made a mockery of full backs and , indeed , those who had likened him to @entity91 , for it quickly became apparent that @entity0 had the potential to be better than his @entity34 team - mate			1
@entity0 has made three @entity101 appearances under new boss @entity102 ( right ) @entity103 : charged with rape in july 2011 but played for @entity105 in september			2
not released by club until end of the season			0
@entity109 and @entity110 : not suspended by @entity111 after charged with grievous bodily harm and affray in 2000			0
@entity114 : @entity111 suspended him for two weeks after the player arrested in connection with rape charge , october 2003			2
after six seasons at the @entity119 , he was given the platform to prove as much			0
but at @entity36 , like so many young @entity122 talents , he regressed			2
there were concerns from within the club about his dedication and life away from football			0
his reputation , though , remained intact , such were the fleeting nature of his sightings in sky blue			0
to the outside observer , he was done an injustice by @entity135			0
and so @entity0 was forgiven his uninspiring two - and - a - half years in @entity136 when he signed for boyhood club @entity13 for £ 10million in the summer of 2012			1
last year , he reflected on his time at @entity36			1
‘ there is a temptation ( to sign for them ) , of course			0
the wages , you ’re flattered when @entity36 are after you , but you ’ll go there and be third choice , ’ he said			2
‘ when i was there , i was always the one who would be dropped when the manager rotated the team			0
i would n’t sign for them now if i was a young @entity122 player			0
’ the winger played 81 minutes of @entity13 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity154 shortly before being arrested @entity0 has scored 20 goals for the @entity13 since signing for the club in 2012 but perhaps @entity135 was sound in his judgment			1
for although , during three seasons on @entity163 , @entity0 ’s three goals in a trio of victories at @entity161 rivals @entity164 have undoubtedly been the highlight , affording him terrace adulation , @entity13 had expected far more when they laid down an eight - figure sum and wages of £ 50,000 per week			1
now , with @entity0 having been charged with three counts of sexual activity with an underage girl and one of grooming , they are facing up to a relegation run - in perhaps without the man in whom they have invested so heavily , should the club decide to suspend him			2
the future of both @entity13 and their star player hang in the balance			1

only a year ago @entity0 was still considered an @entity4 prospect
the former @entity36 winger never *fulfilled* his potential
@entity0 has shown *flashes* of his talent , but never been *consistent*
the future of both @entity13 and their star player hang in the balance
