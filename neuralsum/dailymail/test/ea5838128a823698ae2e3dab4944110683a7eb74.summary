@entity1 left the pitch with a supporter trying to hug him , @entity0 left it knowing that once again the fingers of blame will be pointing at him after his first half miss after @entity8 ’s slip			1
on a night when @entity10 ’s defence once again showed why it is one of the toughest to break down in @entity13 all three @entity15 forwards were unable to get the better of their rivals			1
@entity0 was often the brightest of @entity15 ’s front three but his miss was still the clearest			2
@entity0 will not find too much consolation in the fact that he linked well with @entity1 in the first half			2
with @entity10 ’s left - back position still bearing a @entity25 - shaped hole , @entity0 attacked at will and he looked for @entity1 with his crosses as the @entity27 found himself in centre - forward territory regularly throughout the first 45 minutes			1
@entity1 is confronted by a supporter at the end of the 0 - 0 draw on tuesday night @entity1 gives the fan a hug after a frustrating night at the @entity34 for @entity15 there seems little doubt the man who is fast approaching @entity15 ’s all - time goals record will finish his playing days as a central striker and he came into this game with a scoring rate of a goal every 74 minutes and seven goals in his last three matches			1
@entity0 had scored five in his last four games			0
@entity1 had hit 15 in his 20 @entity15 derbies ; @entity0 had only netted one goal against @entity10 , but what a goal it was – the strike that won the @entity50 final			1
but neither man could find the finish to give @entity15 a vital away goal			0
both @entity0 and @entity1 scored in extra-time in @entity55 and only an incredible performance from @entity57 prevented them from doing so in the first half			2
@entity0 had embraced his pal @entity60 just before kick - off and the @entity63 midfielder did his best to feed him at every opportunity			0
@entity0 misses the best chance of the match early in the first half as @entity57 saves @entity1 is squeezed out by @entity10 midfielders @entity68 ( left ) and @entity69 when free - kicks came @entity15 ’s way they were almost all taken by @entity1 , although @entity0 was allowed to run over one – and in fairness to ronaldo all the set - pieces were awarded on @entity1 ’s favoured left - side of the penalty area			1
in the second half as @entity15 ’s momentum faded so did their deadly duo ’s influence on the game			0
@entity0 apologised to @entity1 after one misplaced pass			2
he probably should n’t have because he would have received the ball sooner if @entity1 had not intercepted it before he reached him			0
their understanding on the pitch still looks like it needs some working on but they will remain the biggest threat to @entity10 in a week ’s time			0
@entity0 stretches to control the ball as @entity10 's @entity93 winger @entity92 looks on			0

@entity15 drew 0 - 0 at @entity10 in @entity50 quarter - final first *leg*
superstars @entity1 and @entity0 both started for @entity15
@entity1 was kept quiet and @entity0 , though *impressive* , missed best chance
