by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 04:43 est , 16 october 2013 an @entity2 man has created a fantastical fairground in the woods by his restaurant - entirely in his spare time			1
@entity6 , the owner of @entity7 in @entity8 , northern @entity2 , has hand - built swings , slides , seesaws , gyroscopes , a ferris wheel and even a roller - coaster over the past 40 years			1
remarkably , all of the rides are hand - operated			1
a new documentary called @entity18 documents his inspiring story , which began in june 1969 when @entity6 brought a a jug of white wine and a jug of red wine and five or six kilos of sausages to the forest			1
over the past forty years he has built an amusement park by hand and in his own time he said : ' i hung all the food on a tree and set the grill under it			1
i also bought some soppressa , a type of salami from @entity49 , the big kind			2
i wanted to see if we would sell something or if people would come , because we did n't even have a sign in front of the place			2
' and then two guys came			2
they stopped by and asked , " what is this ? "			0
' it 's a restaurant			1
' ' how is that possible ? we passed by yesterday and there was nothing ' one of the men asked			0
he replied : ' i told them " you are our first customers			0
' ' and then one , four , ten , twenty people came to the restaurant and in two or three hours the food was finished			1
so exciting ! ' astonishingly , this rollercoaster was built by one man in his workshop in his spare time @entity6 decided he would learn to weld and enjoyed it so much he began to dream up small rides he could build to entice new customers to @entity18 @entity7 now seats 500 people			1
his passion for amusement park rides began almost as an accident			1
@entity6 needed four hooks hooks to join some chairs and went to a blacksmith in town , an old man			1
he said : ' i 'll always remember him , i 'd like to make a monument to him			0
i went to the shop and asked if he could make four hooks			0
do you know what he said ? ' " i do n't have time for these kind of things			0
if you know how to weld , the machine is over there			0
' ' i wish he never said that			0
i went to a workshop to learn how to weld			0
i aksed them to teach me and i started to learn			1
' besides the small rides i made in the beginning , the first big ride i made was that iron slide			1
and that was forty years ago			0
video courtesy of @entity114 / @entity113 2013 his passion for building began forty years ago after a blacksmith told him he was too busy to help him craft four hooks and told him to do it himself humble beginnings : @entity6 started with a few jugs of wine , some sausages and set up a tiny food stand underneath a tree to see if anyone would show up ' at the time , it was big news			1
there were not many strange rides like that			2
and since then i continued building , getting bigger and bigger , until i built all of them			2
' it 's funny because i did n't expect it			0
i did n't imagine it would be such a great success			0
' in the documentary , he ruminates on the future of his beloved park as he contemplates retirement			2
he said : ' i wish it would keep running like this			0
' there 's an @entity2 proverb that says , " you should n't change a winning horse " , but i ca n't impose my ideas on my successors , because everyone has a different point of view			0
i will leave it up to them			0
' the documentary can be seen at @entity158			2
@entity18 , helped by the fame of the amusement park , grew from a food stand selling sausages to a 500 - seat restaurant @entity6 hopes that whoever takes over the restaurant will keep the park running			1

@entity6 started @entity7 in 1969 and discovered a passion for *metalwork* through a chance encounter
since then he has built an amazing array of rides in a forest close to his *popular* restaurant
