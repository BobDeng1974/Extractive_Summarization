by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 was in turmoil last night as senior mps rounded on @entity5 for failing to anticipate the dangers of a @entity8 surge			1
as town hall election results left @entity9 depressed about their chances of regaining power , mr @entity5 was accused of running a ‘ tremendously ill - judged campaign ’ marred by gaffes			1
shadow chancellor @entity15 said the results were ‘ not good enough ’			1
in what was widely seen a dry run for the general election campaign next year , @entity2 ’s vote share was 31 per cent , just two points ahead of the @entity22 and seven points lower than it managed a year before @entity24 lost the 1992 election			1
@entity2 was in turmoil last night as senior mps rounded on @entity5 for failing to anticipate the dangers of a @entity8 surge pressure on mr @entity5 and the ‘ metropolitan elite ’ at the top of his party will increase if , as strategists fear , it is beaten by @entity8 in @entity35 elections , results of which are due tomorrow			1
although @entity2 made progress in @entity40 , it lost huge chunks of its vote to @entity8 in northern strongholds such as @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , and failed to win key @entity48 swing councils in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
its gains of nearly 300 fell well short of the 500 that experts said it needed to show it was on course for general election victory			0
in an ominous sign for mr @entity5 – who insisted he ran a ‘ good ’ campaign – senior members of the shadow @entity62 , including mr @entity15 , @entity63 and @entity64 , were said to have complained they felt ‘ shut out ’ of @entity2 ’s campaign			1
one insider told the @entity2 - supporting @entity68 that the strategy to concentrate on mr @entity5 had failed disastrously			0
‘ it was all @entity5 , @entity72 , @entity73 , ’ the source added			0
mr @entity15 called for the party to strengthen its position on issues including immigration and @entity78 , a key driver of @entity8 support			2
pressure on mr @entity5 and the ' metropolitan elite ' at the top of his party will increase if , as strategists fear , it is beaten by @entity8 in @entity35 elections , results of which are due tomorrow ‘ whether on @entity78 or immigration or on the economy , @entity2 has got more to do to show we can deliver the real fair change people want to see , ’ he said			1
@entity92 , mp for @entity93 , insisted poor results were the ‘ fault of @entity5 and all the people at the top of the @entity2 ’ , who had complacently believed a @entity8 advance would hit only the @entity22			1
arguing that @entity2 ’s ‘ metropolitan elite excluded ordinary people ’ , he added scornfully : ‘ some of the pointy - heads at the top of the party thought that @entity8 doing well is what we needed			1
’ on a day that saw all three main parties hit by the @entity8 advance : yesterday ’s results suggested that as things stand , both @entity2 and the @entity109 will struggle to assemble a @entity112 majority next year			1
ironically , experts said @entity8 ’s advance could help ensure the @entity115 remain in government in another coalition			2
professor @entity118 , of @entity119 , said : ‘ @entity2 ’s lead over conservatives of two points is narrower than last year , and it is narrower than 2012			2
this is a clear warning to @entity2			0
’ @entity5 admitted there was ' a deep sense of discontent ' among voters @entity8 last night hailed a ‘ tremendous result ’ after winning ten council seats in the @entity2 stronghold of @entity44			1
the dramatic result – which saw @entity8 become the biggest opposition group – is a huge blow to @entity2 in its @entity136 heartland , where @entity5 is mp for @entity137			2
it will be seized on by the party as evidence that they are as much of a threat to labour in the @entity137 as they are to the conservatives in @entity136			0
@entity8 councillor and @entity44 branch chairman @entity143 said : ‘ this will send shockwaves			2
if you can break @entity44 , the rest will follow			0
’ @entity9 expressed despair at a series of media gaffes by mr @entity5 during the campaign – including failing to know the price of groceries , forgetting who was in control of a key council during a visit to the area and an unfortunate photocall at which he struggled to eat a bacon sandwich			0
mr @entity92 added : ‘ some of the so - called strategists at the top of the @entity2 think @entity8 doing well is good news because it will damage @entity164			1
' well , they need to get out of their ivory towers and get back into the real world			0
that was a fundamental error			0
’ @entity170 , @entity2 ’s respected former housing minister , warned mr @entity5 : ‘ we need to be clearer , bolder and stronger about the plans we have			2
’ @entity2 grandee @entity173 said the basic presentational errors of the campaign were unforgivable			2
‘ if you are a politician			0
do n’t eat a bacon butty when the world ’s cameras are on you			0
’ @entity180 , mp for @entity181 and @entity182 , said mr @entity5 ‘ is behind in the personality stakes ’ and the party was struggling on economic policy			0
he added that it was ‘ unforgiveably unprofessional ’ for the @entity2 leader not to know the value of his family ’s weekly shopping bill when he was running a ‘ cost of living ’ campaign			1
mr @entity5 admitted there was ‘ a deep sense of discontent ’ among voters			0
‘ you also saw some people turning to @entity8 and i am determined that over the next year we will persuade them that we can change their lives for the better .			0
