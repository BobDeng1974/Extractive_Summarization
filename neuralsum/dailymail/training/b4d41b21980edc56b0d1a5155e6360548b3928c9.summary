by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 04:26 est , 10 april 2013 speeds of ' superfast ' 4g broadband services are to double , provider @entity1 announced today			1
average speeds on the network currently range between @entity6 and @entity7 but this is to be given a boost to more than @entity10			1
the service is expected to enable users to surf the web much more quickly on mobile phones			0
@entity1 , @entity1 's chief executive officer , said headline speeds would reach more than @entity17 and the benefits would be brought in for both new and current subscribers			2
@entity1 is set to double the speed of its 4g network in a bid to steal a march on its rivals , which can not launch until later this year @entity1 , which was formed from the merger of @entity1 and @entity1 , was the first company to offer a 4g network in the @entity27 and others are expected to follow suit in the coming months			1
for the typical user , download speeds of initial 4g networks should be at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3g networks			2
@entity1 , formerly known as @entity1 , plans to extend the service to around 80 locations - and approximately 55 % of the @entity27 population - by june			2
prices start at £ 15.99 per month			0
' we are ensuring that the @entity27 remains at the forefront of the digital revolution , ' he said			0
' having already pioneered @entity44 here , we 're now advancing the country 's infrastructure again with an even faster , even higher - capacity network , and at no extra cost to our customers			1
' since launching @entity44 , the company said it had observed a ' huge shift ' in the way people use mobile phones			1
this includes an increase in the number of consumers using video , maps and sat - nav tools.double - speed services will be rolled out in ten cities where @entity44 is already in place by the summer			1
these include @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
the announcement comes just weeks after @entity44 was extended to the @entity77 in @entity78 , one of the @entity27 's most rural regions , for the first time			1
the service is now available in 50 towns and cities across the country			0
@entity1 aims to reach one million @entity44 customers by the end of the year			2
@entity88 of analysts @entity89 , said the move is designed to put pressure on @entity1 's competitors , which will launch later this year			0
' the fact that @entity1 has chosen to announce that it is doubling the average speed of its 4g network to @entity10 in ten @entity27 cities , shows shrewd timing on the operator ’s part and capitalising on its pioneering role as the leader in @entity44			1
@entity1 has already undertaken a massive ad campaign in a bid to capitalise on its advantage @entity44 offers far faster speeds , and for @entity1 customers , the top speed in set to double ' it raises the bar for competitors @entity111 and @entity113 , which we expect to launch rival networks in may or june			1
' having spent more than its rivals at the @entity44 auction , @entity111 could assume a position to replicate @entity1 's move			2
' however , this does put @entity113 at a competitive disadvantage as it failed to secure any additional spectrum above @entity122			0
' @entity1 said it would also double the amount of spectrum bandwidth dedicated to @entity44 to give customers better access to ' some of the fastest mobile speeds in the world ' while ' revolutionising working practices '			1
with newly boosted speeds , customers should be able to upload or download pictures in high definition with greater resolution or view and share videos without delay			0
@entity138 , telecoms regulation analyst at research firm @entity140 , said @entity1 's latest move would pose a challenge to its competitors who plan to roll out 4g services later this year			0
' given @entity1 's large and contiguous holding of spectrum at @entity147 , this puts them in a very strong position and makes it more difficult for their peers to play catch - up once they launch networks in the coming weeks and months , ' he added			0
he suggested that today 's announcement showed @entity1 was also keen to ' dampen rumours ' of weak take - up .			0

average speeds on the network currently range between @entity6 and @entity7 but this is to be given a boost to more than @entity10
double - speed services will be rolled out in ten cities where @entity44 is already in place
