a natural drug found in the soil of @entity3 could help people live longer and improve their memory in old age , scientists claim			1
in tests in mice , the rapamycin drug halted the decline in brain function as the rodents aged , and offered hope that it could also treat depression			1
now scientists are planning to trial the ' holy grail of anti-ageing ' in pet dogs , which they say will provide a more realistic test environment to predict how it would work on humans			1
scientists at the @entity24 in @entity25 are planning to trial the drug in pet dogs , which they say will provide a more realistic test environment to predict how it would work on humans the drug , rapamycin , is a bacterial by - product discovered in the shadows of the island 's famous statues and is named after @entity3 , the @entity38 name for @entity3			1
it is already used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection and several years ago , scientists in the journal @entity44 , said it can improve learning and help treat cognitive decline			2
in mice , it has been shown to extend the lives of mice by 13 per cent in females and nine per cent in males			0
due to the high costs , the compound 's effect on lifespan has not yet been tested in people , according to a report by @entity60 in @entity61			2
a natural drug found in the soil of @entity3 ( pictured ) could help people live longer and improve their memory in old age , scientists claim it comes with some major risks , however			1
for instance , the compound suppresses the immune system and makes patients vulnerable to any viruses and bacteria			1
@entity76 is a bacterial by - product discovered in the shadows of the island 's famous statues			0
it is named after @entity3 , the @entity38 name for @entity3 , which sits isolated in the @entity83 - 2000 miles from anywhere			2
it is already used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection and scientists say it can improve learning and help treat cognitive decline			2
it could even treat conditions like @entity95 's , they believe			0
however , it comes with some serious side effects			0
for instance , the compound suppresses the immune system and makes patients vulnerable to any viruses and bacteria			1
the existing version of the drug also increases the risk of cancer and would need to be modified before using in human trials			0
the existing version of the drug also increases the risk of cancer and would need to be modified before using in human trials			0
however , researchers believe further research will lead them to similar - but less harmful - anti-therapies			2
' any compound has side effects of some sort ; the question is what kind of side effects one can live with , ' says @entity121 , a gerontologist at the @entity122 told @entity61			0
@entity123 and @entity124 at the @entity24 in @entity25 propose to give low doses of rapamycin to dogs			0
the researchers today invited experts in canine health and the biology to a meeting to discuss how to structure such a trial			0
an initial trial would involve about 30 dogs , half of which would receive the drug			2
they hope to test the drug in large dogs that typically live for eight to ten years , and will start giving rapamycin to the animals aged six to nine			1
according to @entity61 , the trial could be completed in as little as three years , but researchers will know within months whether rapamycin proves effective			1
due to the high costs , the compound 's effect on lifespan has not yet been tested in people			0
however , scientists hope it will allow people to live longer , with a better quality of life @entity76 is a bacterial by - product discovered in the shadows of @entity3 's famous statues			1
it is named after @entity3 , the @entity38 name for @entity3			0

rapamycin , discovered in @entity3 soil , has been tested on mice
scientists say dogs provide more similar test environment to humans
drug could help people live longer and improve memory in old age
there are , however , big risks such as *suprression* of immune system
dog trial could be completed in three years , but researchers will know within months whether rapamycin proves effective
