the head of a failing children 's services that let down murdered schoolboy @entity4 should stand down immediately , an mp has said			1
@entity5 announced he would be standing down from his job in september as a result of an appalling assessment by @entity9 that rated @entity11 's primary schools as the worst in the country			1
however , @entity0 mp said he should leave now			2
in an extraordinary outburst , the mp for @entity14 said that @entity4 had been ' badly let down ' by his mother and stepfather , health professionals and social services			2
calling for mr @entity5 to go immediately , he said : ' he takes with him the indelible stain of @entity4 's cruel death , which his department had failed to prevent			1
they will be sentenced tomorrow @entity4 's mother @entity4 , 27 , and stepfather @entity4 , 34 , were found guilty of his murder yesterday			1
in what was a harrowing case of cruelty , @entity36 @entity35 heard he had been starved so badly he looked like a ' concentration camp victim '			0
he was also locked in a tiny room , force - fed salt and held underwater in a bath until he was unconscious			0
mr @entity0 added : mr @entity0 said : ' how can the staff at the school attended by @entity4 have failed to have recognised patterns of behaviour that should have set alarm bells ringing , not only within the school but within the corridors of power within the @entity51 ? ' how could anyone believe it to be normal for a child to climb on the top of furniture to get to food ; to scavenge around bins to access waste ; and to steal food from the lunch - boxes ? ' what human being , with the slightest understanding of children , would not have been concerned enough to take action to set alarm bells ringing ? final hours : @entity4 ( circled in green ) is seen leaving @entity66 in @entity11 with his mother ( circled in yellow ) just 36 hours before he died mother who would murder him : @entity4 , aged four , runs after his mother @entity4 hours before he was killed prison : the tiny unfurnished box room that @entity4 was locked in for hours on end			1
the urine - soaked room had only a mattress			0
the door had been tampered with so @entity4 could not get out filthy : a dirty mattress @entity4 was forced to sleep on during his confinement in the box room in his home in @entity11 ' where were these individuals when @entity4 needed them most ? @entity84 triumphed over common sense , care , and compassion			2
' those who failed @entity4 must examine their own consciences , and conclude whether it is appropriate for them to remain in their posts			2
' @entity4 and @entity4 also hoodwinked the authorities who then missed crucial opportunities to save the boy who had been starved for six months			1
yesterday neither @entity4 nor @entity4 showed any emotion as the jury found them guilty of murdering the boy			1
@entity4 was a ‘ bag of bones ’ when he died , despite the fact that teachers had seen him stealing food from bins			1
and social services closed the file on him even after the couple waited 12 hours to take him to hospital with a broken arm			1
convicted killers : @entity110 , @entity4 's mother , and his stepfather @entity4 who were found guilty of murder by a jury at @entity36 @entity35 following the trial , it emerged : during the nine - week trial , @entity36 @entity35 heard how @entity4 was systematically starved , tortured , force - fed salt and locked in a home - made cell in @entity11 for days			1
' those with the ultimate duty of care turned @entity4 from a beautiful and bright - eyed little boy into a broken bag of bones ' detective inspector @entity125 he was so frightened of @entity4 – who forced him to perform punishment exercises such as squat thrusts – that he would wet himself when spoken to by an adult man			1

he also stood 3ft 3inches tall , six inches smaller than the average			0
his body bore 30 separate injuries , including the fatal bleed on his brain caused by a violent assault to the head			0
police never established which of the pair delivered the blow , but @entity4 spent his final hours locked in his cell on the mattress he was forced to use as a bed and toilet			1
by the time @entity4 made a ‘ staged ’ 999 call on march 3 last year , two days after the assault , he had been dead for a few hours			2
@entity4 and @entity4 were arrested two days later after a post mortem examination found @entity4 died from a large subdural haematoma			1
murdered schoolboy : the catalogue of injuries inflicted on little @entity4 , which were found when his body was examined when the couple ’s computer was examined , 55 internet searches including ‘ table salt overdose ’ , ‘ when a child stops responding ’ and ‘ patient in a coma ’ had been made			2
' once again crucial questions need to be asked about how a youngster slipped through the child protection net with the most catastrophic of consequences ' @entity164 , @entity165 @entity4 , who was described as a ‘ monster ’ in court , also admitted that he went online to check his bank account and the price of car tyres after the assault			2
@entity36 @entity35 also heard that the couple had sex just hours before they were arrested			0
@entity4 later accused @entity4 of raping her			0
but days later she was observed holding and stroking her lover ’s hand in the dock of @entity11 magistrates ' court as the pair appeared charged with murder			0
guilty : @entity4 , 27 , left , told police she had been raped by her partner to try and cover up the fact they were starving and beating four - year - old @entity4 ( right ) in court , the couple both denied muirder and blamed each other for his death , with @entity4 claiming @entity4 attacked @entity4 after he wet the bed and @entity4 saying he was injured in a series of falls			1
but prosecutor @entity192 , @entity193 , said a series of sickening texts in @entity196 between the pair showed the extent to which they acted as a ‘ team ’ to abuse the boy			0
at the time of the abuse , @entity4 and @entity4 were both drinking heavily and taking drugs , including cannabis and amphetamines			0
the court heard how the couple managed to trick officials into believing that @entity4 was suffering from a genetically inherited eating disorder which left him permanently hungry			0
his teacher @entity212 described seeing him scavenging in classmates ’ lunchboxes for food and likened his gaunt appearance to that of a ‘ leukaemia ’ sufferer			0
' doting ' : @entity4 's stepfather @entity4 cradles a baby in this family photo			2
his treatment of the child is a far cry from the abuse he meted out on @entity227 questioning : @entity4 - seen in a court artist 's sketch - was accused of having lied to try and ' save her own skin ' today during her trial at @entity36 @entity35 witnesses said he was ‘ disappearing ’ inside his school uniform and looked ‘ desperate and lonely ’			1
by then , he had been reduced to looking in playground bins			0
the pair told the school that he should not be fed as it would interfere with the medication for the fictional condition , so staff locked up the other children ’s lunchboxes			0
but despite their concerns and suspicions – especially after teaching staff saw him with bruising to his neck and black eyes – nothing was done			0
police were also aware of both defendants and attended the couple ’s home at least three times in the year before @entity4 ’s murder			1
social services had become involved after the couple waited 12 hours to take @entity4 to hospital when he broke his arm			2
devastated father : @entity261 , @entity4 's biological dad , leaves court after giving evidence against his son 's mother and stepfather at an earlier hearing during the nine - week trial prosecutors believe @entity4 broke @entity4 ’s arm ‘ clean in half ’ , but the couple said he had fallen off a sofa			1
the senior investigating officer in the case , detective inspector @entity125 , said : ‘ those with the ultimate duty of care turned @entity4 from a beautiful and bright - eyed little boy into a broken bag of bones			1
' they left him , starving , locked in a room in the dark to die on his own			0
’ @entity164 of the @entity165 , said : ‘ once again crucial questions need to be asked about how a youngster slipped through the child protection net with the most catastrophic of consequences			0
’ a serious case review into the tragedy , commissioned by @entity289 , is due to be completed in september			0
the couple are expected to be sentenced tomorrow .			0
