a researcher 's accidental discovery could pave the way for a baldness cure by harnessing the power of white blood cells			2
the cancer expert was testing anti-inflammatory drugs on mice when she was surprised to discover they were growing extra fur , so investigated what was causing the phenomenon			1
she discovered it was due to macrophages , which are derived from white blood cells called monocytes and are produced by the immune system to fight infections and clear up dead tissue			1
that means follicles could be encouraged to grow without the need for a hair transplant , which can cost upwards of Â£ 5,000			0
she and the study 's other authors wrote in the journal @entity46 : ' one of the current challenges in the stem cell field is ... to promote regeneration without the need of transplantation			2
' because of this study , it is now known that macrophages play a key role in the environment surrounding stem cells			1
' our study underlines the importance of macrophages as modulators in skin regenerative processes , going beyond their primary function as phagocytic immune cells			0
' proud : some men go to great lengths to disguise their baldness , but others including @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) are happy to show it off			0
so far , the researchers ' theory has been tested only in mice previous research has identified signals from the skin that help prompt hair growth , but exactly how different types of cells do this continues to stir debate			1
the study 's authors believe their findings could also influence approaches to tissue regeneration , ageing and cancer			2
dr @entity92 made the discovery by accident while she was working on another research project			0
she observed that the mice she was working with had started to regrow hair when they were given anti-inflammatory drugs			1
@entity105 as to whether communication between stem cells and immune cells could be the cause , her lab tested several immune system cells to see if they had any influence			0
they found that some macrophage cells activated nearby stem cells and hair began to grow again			1
widespread : half of all @entity113 men suffer from baldness by the time they reach 50 , including @entity117 they then tested the theory by treating the mice with a drug which suppressed the main signals sent out by macrophages - and found that the growth was delayed			1
although the study was carried out in mice , the researchers believe their discovery may enable the development of new treatments for hair growth in humans			2
their method of using tiny droplets called liposomes to carry the drug to specific cells could be repeated , they added			0
half of all @entity113 men suffer from baldness by the time they reach the age of 50 , with many going to great lengths to disguise the change			0
that is despite several ' bald pride ' movements and no shortage of celebrities who proudly show off their bare heads - including @entity73 , @entity72 and @entity117 .			0

method discovered by accident at @entity25 's main cancer research *centre*
researcher found mice given anti-inflammatory drugs grew extra hair
study now claims link was due to *complex* cells called macrophages
infection - fighters activated nearby stem cells responsible for hair growth
author : method could allow regeneration without need for a transplant
