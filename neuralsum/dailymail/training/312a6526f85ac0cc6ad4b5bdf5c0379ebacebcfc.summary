by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 3 october 2013 a teenage swimmer has told how he suffered an eye infection which spread to his brain			1
@entity4 , 16 , suffered a number of migraines in july last year before being diagnosed with an eye infection			1
it is not clear now how he got the infection			0
@entity4 said : ‘ i was admitted into hospital and with the infection becoming embedded in my brain , suddenly i had brain surgeons talking about having to operate to save my life			1
@entity4 , 16 , was diagnosed with an eye infection after he started suffering migraines			1
he was admitted to hospital when the infection spread to his brain			1
surgeons considered carrying out brain surgery to tackle @entity4 's infection but decided , as it was very risky , to try draining the infection first			1
this proved to be effective ‘ suddenly my life was in danger , but you ’ve just got to fight have n’t you ? all i wanted to do was to get back into the pool , and normality			0
’ but a decision by the medical team at @entity33 ’s @entity32 trying to decide the best way forward proved vital			2
@entity4 said : ‘ luckily , one of the professors decided it was too risky for such a complicated procedure with me being so young , so instead opted to drain the infection and hope for the best - fortunately it worked			1
’ @entity4 ( pictured in hospital ) said : ' it came as a real shock when you think it just started out as an eye infection			1
i was admitted into hospital and with the infection becoming embedded in my brain , suddenly i had brain surgeons talking about having to operate to save my life ' @entity4 ’s mother @entity52 added : ‘ at first he was only let out of hospital for six hours at a time			1
‘ most people would just want to go straight home			0
but @entity4 ? no. he wanted to go straight down to the swimming club , his other family , and see his mates and coaches there			2
‘ he ’s so tough mentally - we were still recovering from being told our boy could die , while he just shrugged it off			0
‘ that ’s one reason why i really believe he ’s in such a good position to realise his dream			0
’ @entity4 , who hopes to win a place in @entity70 , was not allowed to return to the pool until six months after he developed the eye infection but was delighted to get a personal best in his first competition after recovering @entity4 said : ' in a strange way the illness has given me even more motivation to get to where i want to be - racing for @entity70 - and that starts with the @entity80 next year ' while @entity4 was in the early stages of his battle to return to full health his doctors refused to give him the all - clear to return to the pool			1
but he threw himself into regaining fitness at the @entity89 pool ’s small gym for two hours every day			0
@entity90 , @entity4 ’s coach , said : ‘ you ca n’t praise the lad enough			2
@entity4 's mother , @entity52 ( pictured with @entity4 and his father , @entity93 ) , said : ' he 's so tough mentally - we were still recovering from being told our boy could die , while he just shrugged it off ' ‘ to go through an ordeal like he did would have destroyed a lot of young athletes but as soon as he was able to , he forced himself into a small gym to train when he could n’t in the pool			2
’ the hard work and determination paid off in january this year when doctors finally gave him the go - ahead to return to the pool , and full training			0
since then @entity4 has n’t looked back and despite everything that had happened he returned to competition in july and now has set his sights firmly on making the @entity111 squad next year			2
@entity4 says that after his illness he feels like he has been given a second chance and that it has increased his motivation to become a member of the @entity70 swimming team @entity4 said : ‘ obviously setting personal bests in my first meet back was pleasing , but it ’s just the start as far as i ’m concerned			0
‘ in a strange way the illness has given me even more motivation to get to where i want to be - racing for @entity70 - and that starts with the @entity80 next year			0
’ @entity4 added : ‘ it feels like i ’ve been given a second chance , and i ’m going to take it			0
