@entity124 , @entity125 , 4 hours ago i think the answer lies in the " he now works for her husbands rival company " sounds like he was working against her with her ex hubbie , as it turns out she was obviously right not to trust him			0

" wow @entity163 elli , would you rather they showed a picture of him in a bra and her in a suit ? @entity168 reaching fornews , birmingham , @entity169 , 5 hours ago she 's always a bit desperate and just too ready to pose in her @entity173 am not sure it helps to see your boss in next - to nothing			0
