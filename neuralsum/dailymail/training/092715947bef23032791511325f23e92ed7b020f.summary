disgraced former @entity1 official @entity0 got $ 129,300 in bonuses between 2010 and 2013 , during the years when she allegedly supervised a program targeting conservative nonprofit groups with intrusive levels nad scrutiny that liberal group managed to avoid			1
@entity0 , then in charge of the @entity1 's @entity9 , drew a top - tier salary that reached $ 177,000 â€“ plus a 25 per cent ' retention bonus			1
' that 's a federal workforce perk designed to keep high - ranking officials from retiring or jumping to more lucrative offers in the private sector			2
those annual bonuses , valued at an average of $ 43,000 , only stopped because continuing them would have pushed her over the legal limit of how much a government employee can earn			1
@entity49 first recommended @entity0 for a $ 42,000 retention bonus in december 2009 , the @entity37 reported , when he was the acting irs commissioner			2
she got $ 43,050 and $ 44,250 in the next two years			0
but in november 2012 the @entity1 determined that continuing to make the payouts each year would violate a federal regulation that sets a hard limit on federal workers ' earnings			1
with another retention bonus , she would have been earning more than the maximum allowed , which was $ 230,700			0
but at the end of 2009 she had become eligible for retirement , and @entity49 wanted to keep her on the job			0
' ms. @entity0 is eligible for retirement and as an attorney with extensive experience would likely command a much greater pay and benefits if she left the service , ' he wrote then			0
' without a retention incentive she will leave the ( @entity65			0
' ' her unique blend of specialized technical expertise , broad organizational knowledge , and leadership skills can not be matched , ' he added at the time			0
@entity72 , @entity0 's immediate supervisor as deputy commissioner of the tax - exempt division , approved the massive check along with @entity49 himself			1
@entity72 would later resign in disgrace in may 2013 , at president @entity78 's specific demand , after the depth of @entity0 's alleged scheme became known @entity72 ' retired ' one day later			1
@entity0 waited until september 2013 for her own retirement , letting the calendar advance to the point where she earned a full federal government pension			2
in may 2013 @entity0 launched one of the @entity78 administration 's most political damaging scandals by planting a question during a tax accountants conference about how her subagency scrutinized right - wing tax exemption applicants that the administration thought might be political groups in disguise			1
she acknowledged that organizations with words like ' tea party ' or ' patriot ' in their names were processed differently , on a schedule that could stretch out for years			0
crying all the way to the bank : @entity0 retired with a full federal government pension @entity0 knew at the time that the @entity1 @entity104 was ready to release an audit report exposing the practice of singling out conservatives			1
that report came out just four days later			0
the @entity1 , the inspector general wrote , ' used inappropriate criteria that identified for review @entity111 and other organizations applying for tax - exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention			2
' a congressional investigation , now nearly two years old , stalled in 2014 after @entity1 commissioner @entity121 claimed years ' worth of @entity0 's emails were lost during a hard - drive crash			1
emails tha twere recovered showed @entity0 caomplaining that political conservatives were ' crazies ' and ' a * * holes			0

' retention ' bonuses were paid in 2010 , 2011 and 2012 in order to keep @entity0 from leaving the @entity1
payouts were later *canceled* because continuing them would have put her over the legal limit of how much a federal employee can earn
bonuses came in the same years when @entity0 's @entity1 subagency was targeting tea parties and other conservative groups with extra scrutiny
liberal groups *sailed* through , however , and the practice was later *condemned* by @entity149 in @entity32
the @entity1 higher - ups who approved @entity0 's bonuses *ultimately* resigned in disgrace , and @entity0 was allowed to retire with a full pension
