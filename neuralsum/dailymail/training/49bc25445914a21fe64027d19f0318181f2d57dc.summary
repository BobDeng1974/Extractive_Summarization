there have been calls for an overhaul of maths education in @entity4 after it emerged just one in five pupils continue with the subject beyond gcse level			1
a study has revealed just one in five students in @entity4 go on to study maths after the age of 16 , in contrast to countries like @entity16 and @entity17 , where more than 90 per cent of pupils continue with the subject			1
in @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 , over 65 per cent of students persevere with maths			2
low numbers : a study has shown that in @entity4 the majority of students choose to drop maths after taking the subject at gcse level the @entity31 , which carried out the research , wants to see a new maths qualification introduced in @entity4 for those pupils who do not wish to study the subject at @entity36 or a-level			1
the new qualification should focus on mathematical fluency and statistics according to the study , which looked at maths education in seven countries			1
it suggests that some students should be given an extra year to prepare for their maths gcse to ensure they have a good grasp of the subject			2
and it says that encouraging teenagers to study a wide range of subjects may be a better way to increase take - up of maths than making it compulsory			0
the report argues that @entity22 and @entity21 have high levels of pupils taking advanced maths , which is equivalent to as - level , but it is not compulsory			0
overhaul : the @entity31 wants to see the introduction of a new maths qualification in @entity4 for those students that do n't want to study the subject at @entity36 or @entity36 instead , both countries allow students to take a choice of subjects , but require these to cover a range of disciplines			1
for example , in @entity21 a student studying arts and humanities must also choose a maths or science option			0
the report also found that the evidence from @entity17 , @entity22 and @entity21 indicates that the strongest incentive for students to continue studying maths is because they need to do so for higher education or employment			0
it also says that universities and employers should ask students planning to study subjects such as teaching and nursing to continue taking maths beyond @entity93			2
report author professor @entity94 said : ' our study shows the importance of a consensual approach to policy development and implementation			1
' higher education and employers will need to be involved in the development of a new qualification if they are to value it and to make it an entry requirement			0
' schools and colleges may need to be incentivised to offer the new qualification to students , as well as to ensure that existing advanced qualifications maintain their levels of participation			0

the number of students continuing to study maths after the age of 16 in @entity4 is lower than in many other countries , a new study shows
it calls for @entity4 to introduce a new maths qualification for those who do not want to go on to take the subject at @entity36 or @entity36
