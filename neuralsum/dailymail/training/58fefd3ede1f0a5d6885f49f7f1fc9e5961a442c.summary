@entity1 chiefs accepted yesterday that producers had made a huge mistake in a children ’s programme by claiming that @entity6 was ‘ racist ’			1
historians had accused the corporation of ‘ insulting ’ her memory by dramatising a scene showing the nurse – famous for her work in the @entity14 – discriminating against a black colleague , @entity15			2
horrible histories featured a sketch in which @entity18 rejects four job applications from @entity20 - born miss @entity15 , saying the work was only ‘ for @entity23 girls ’			1
one member , professor @entity37 , wrote in the @entity38 in august how political correctness had led to @entity18 being smeared			2
originally broadcast as part of the hit children 's @entity26 history show , the sketch also appeared on the @entity1 's @entity45 , an educational , online resource for children			1
the romantic image of @entity6 ( left ) caring for wounded soldiers in the @entity50 and ( right ) the lady with the lamp in old age viewers saw the actress playing @entity56 say : ' the nursing corps was for @entity23 girls			1
you 're from @entity20 ' to which @entity15 responded : ' me father was from @entity61			0
' the @entity15 character was also seen saying : ' four times me tried to join @entity65 's nurses in the @entity14 , and four times she said no. ' yesterday the @entity67 , the corporation ’s governing body , ruled that the two - minute , 34 - second clip ’s ‘ depiction of @entity6 in relation to racial issues was materially inaccurate ’			1
the @entity73 said that programme - makers should have done more to make it clear that it was not @entity18 herself who rejected @entity15			1
@entity15 had , in fact , gone to @entity50 to start her business and did n't ask once for a job			1
@entity6 ( left ) with her pet owl ( in a drawing done by her sister @entity84 ) and @entity15 ( right ) whose role in the @entity50 has been overplayed according to her biographer			1
@entity15 never nursed in a hospital , did not start a nursing school , never wrote books or articles on nursing			2
she never did anything to rival @entity6 's truly pioneering work to improve healthcare the reality is that she went to @entity96 in the spring of 1855 to set up a provisions store that sold luxury items ( such as tinned lobster ) to officers , and a restaurant and bar where they could dine and drink champagne			0
it was hardly fare for rank and file soldiers			0
rather than ministering to the sick and wounded , @entity15 's main work by day was food preparation			2
it said that viewers of the clip , which also showed the pair jostling , ' would be likely to receive the overall impression that @entity6 had acted towards @entity15 in a racially discriminatory manner '			0
it said that given miss @entity6 's ' significant stature ' in modern @entity23 history , the allegation required ' compelling proof '			2
members of the committee : former @entity124 executive producer @entity123 ( left ) and @entity125 ( right ) are among the six trustees on the @entity1 's @entity73 the @entity73 concluded that the sketch breached guidelines on accuracy , saying : ' given the seriousness of any imputation of racism , the relative recency of @entity6 's life ... the immensity of @entity6 's contribution to modern nursing and her significant stature in modern @entity23 history , the @entity73 felt it was incumbent on the programme makers to ensure that there was sound evidence upon which to base any suggestion that she had acted in a racially discriminatory manner in a @entity45 clip			1
' it appeared to the @entity147 that an allegation of such gravity against a person such as @entity56 required compelling proof			0
in the @entity73 's view , the programme makers had provided no such evidence			2
' it said that it was not trying to suggest limiting ' the range of comedic or dramatic devices ' used in history content for children			0
' however in this very specific instance , making a charge of racism was very serious			0
' it added : ' @entity147 felt in considering this particular clip and this issue , especially given that it appeared in the @entity165 , it was important for a clear and rigorous adherence to fact , even within the context of the audience expectations for the format of @entity25			0
' children 's comedy @entity25 began in 1993 as a series of books , written by @entity175 , before being adapted into stage productions and a @entity26 tv show			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ' we note and accept the findings of the @entity73			1
the intention of this @entity25 sketch was never to undermine the reputation of such an important historical figure like @entity6 , but to open up a discussion of some of the attitudes of the time			0
' @entity189 has withdrawn the sketch from their website and the episode of @entity25 will not be repeated in its present form			0

show taken to task by @entity1 's own @entity73
@entity73 ruled that the sketch breached *editorial* guidelines on accuracy
suggested , wrongly , that @entity18 turned down @entity15 for not being @entity23
@entity15 never applied for a job as she went to @entity50 to start a business
