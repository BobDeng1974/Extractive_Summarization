@entity0 endured another unhappy return to the @entity2 as @entity3 leapfrogged @entity4 in the championship			1
not since the halcyon days under @entity0 , highlighted by a @entity7 win and @entity9 final appearance , have @entity3 fans had so much to feel optimistic about			1
and @entity11 's men came out on top thanks to a stellar performance from former @entity15 loanee @entity14 , who scored eight times in 21 appearances during a spell at @entity19 last year			2
down to 10 men after @entity57 had been dismissed in the build - up to the spot - kick , @entity4 could not find a response as @entity0 lost on @entity85 for the second successive campaign			1
that left his former club looking down on the rest of the league , at least for a few hours , with @entity91 or @entity92 both able to replace them with victory in their respective 3pm kick - offs			0
@entity3 enjoyed a flying start as they took the lead through @entity42			2
after finding space with some clever movement , the striker was left with the simple task of diverting @entity103 's clever pull - back in off the post for a sixth goal in seven games			0
@entity4 looked rattled as their usually - crisp passing game faltered			0
and they would have fallen further behind but for a stunning double - save by @entity26			0
having denied @entity27 following a @entity26 through - ball , the goalkeeper produced a stunning one - handed stop on the stretch to turn @entity44 's follow - up effort over the crossbar			2
@entity3 made a strong case for their promotion chase to the @entity117 with the 2 - 0 victory @entity4 had a bad day at the office against @entity3 as the home side claimed three points on saturday undeterred , @entity3 continued to push forward , with @entity103 hitting a 20 - yard strike narrowly over crossbar			1
the one - way traffic did not relent for the remainder of the half , although @entity4 were nearly gifted a leveller			2
@entity35 ' poor clearance flew straight to @entity64 , who fed @entity59			0
however , the midfielder 's weak effort gave the goalkeeper an easy opportunity to atone			0
@entity0 made a double change at the interval in an attempt to spark a reversal of fortunes , @entity62 and @entity138 replacing @entity66 and @entity61			0
@entity3 remained in the ascendancy , though , with @entity26 brilliantly keeping out a @entity26 free - kick that had just evaded @entity37			1
@entity3 were not made to pay for their misses , @entity57 bringing down @entity42 in the area following @entity44 's superb pass - allowing @entity26 to hammer home from the spot			1
the ever - dangerous @entity14 twice stung the hands of @entity26 afterwards , yet it mattered little as @entity3 took the points - albeit with the help of a superb @entity35 save that stopped @entity63 setting up a tense finale			1
derby face @entity117 leaders @entity78 on tuesday in the @entity7 at home			0

@entity14 opened scoring after just six minutes against @entity4
@entity3 doubled their lead in the second half through a penalty
@entity26 stepped up to make it 2 - 0 as @entity57 was sent off
@entity0 's return to his former club proves an unhappy one
