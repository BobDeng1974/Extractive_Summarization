a letter to @entity1 dating back nearly a century has been found lodged in the chimney of a boarding school where it was sent by an enthusiastic young girl			1
the flame - singed note , written by a schoolgirl called @entity9 , asks @entity10 for a copy of a novel and a new dress , and was apparently sent in or shortly after 1922			1
it was found lodged inside a chimney at @entity16 , in @entity17 , by a caretaker who was clearing out the fireplace after raven chicks had been nesting in it			1
discovery : a century - old letter to @entity1 has been found in a chimney at @entity16 by caretaker @entity25 , pictured with a group of pupils the letter was initially almost illegible because of the damage caused by exposure to years of smoke , but after it was restored it could be read once again			1
it was addressed to ' @entity33 ' , and read in full : ' @entity34 , are you coming to see me again in two weeks ' time i suppose ? ' tell mummy i want a book , tell @entity40 , and an evening dress			1
tell @entity40 , a novel about the @entity45 by @entity46 , was published in 1922 - leading school officials to assume that the letter is likely to have been written soon afterwards			2
@entity49 was probably around 10 or 11 years old at the time of the letter , because the bulding where it was found has always been a boarding house for girls of that age			2
illegible : but the letter from a girl called @entity43 could eventually be deciphered after it was restored school caretaker @entity25 found the note in october when he was vacuuming inside the chimney and realised there was something resting on a ledge			1
' i pulled it out and saw it was a folded bit of paper and because i ’m curious , i tried to read it , ' he said			0
' i could see " @entity34 " and the dress bit but that was all			0
it 's a lot cleaner now but you still ca n't find a date on it			0
' i was just surprised really that it had n't been destroyed			0
i found it tucked up on the top ledge - it 's quite a lucky find			0
' delight : pupils at the school have been trying to check up other chimneys to see if there 's anything inside @entity85 said that the pupils had been trying to explore other chimneys in the school to see what treasures might be hidden inside			2
' the girls were so excited about the letter , ' she said			0
' i think reading something like this makes them appreciate what they have more			0
' you can tell them until you 're blue in the face about how people in the old days did n't have as much as they do today , but actually reading this letter and seeing that all the girl asked for was a book and a dress made it more real			1
' @entity16 was founded in 1892 , and moved to its present site in the town of @entity107 , near the border between @entity40 and @entity109 , five years later			2
