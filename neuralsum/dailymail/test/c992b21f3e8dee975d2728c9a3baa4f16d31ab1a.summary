coming up with a punishment that will teach a son or daughter not to commit the crime again but is n't harsh enough to scar them for life is tough			2

reddit users have been comparing the most effective punishments their parents doled out when they were children and many of the schemes are both hilarious and genius parents often struggle to find the balance between a punishment being effective and not too harsh ( picture posed by model ) one @entity53 user 's mother used her son 's naughty behaviour as a cheap means to improve her house			1

when i told her i was failing @entity68 back in high school my punishment was to build her a pond - it took me a solid week of work to dig it out , line it , shape it , fill it and then plant [ everything ] around it			1
' she told me after that , that she really hated the 30 year old cherry tree in the yard and if my grades did n't improve i 'd be removing it			0

' many mothers and fathers use their child 's favourite toy or book as a way to guarantee good behaviour in the future ( picture posed by model ) some parents applied the same logic to their child 's wardrobe , taking away all of their favourite clothing , so that they had to live in embarrassingly uncool clothes			1
one user wrote : ' my 7 year old daughter who loves fashion f * * * * * up real bad one day - we had tried every standard punishment and nothing ever seemed to phase her			1
