a new diet could more than halve a person 's risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , according to new research			1
experts said the diet , known by the acronym mind , could reduce the risk of the illness even if it not meticulously followed			2
the ' @entity10 for @entity11 ' ( mind ) diet includes at least three daily servings of wholegrains and salad – along with an extra vegetable and a glass of wine			1
the new diet could more than halve a person 's risk of developing alzheimer 's disease , new research has found , and even has an effect when a person does n't follow it meticulously these ' brain - healthy foods ' lowered the risk of @entity26 's by 53 per cent in those who stuck to the diet rigidly			1
for those that followed it moderately well , it lowered the risk by about 35 per cent			2
professor @entity34 , a nutritional epidemiologist of the @entity35 in @entity36 , said : ' one of the more exciting things about this is that people who adhered even moderately to the @entity12 diet had a reduction in their risk for @entity26 's disease			1
' i think that will motivate people			0
' professor @entity47 and her colleagues developed the @entity12 diet based on years of past research about what foods and nutrients have good and bad effects on the functioning of the brain			2
this is the first study to relate the @entity12 diet to alzheimer 's disease			2
' i was so very pleased to see the outcome we got from the new diet , ' she said			0
the @entity12 diet is a hybrid of the @entity64 and @entity65 ( @entity65 ) diets , both of which have been found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular conditions , like high blood pressure , heart attack and stroke			2
wine is a ' healthy brain food ' , researchers said 10 healthy brain foods : @entity79 leafy vegetables other vegetables nuts berries beans @entity84 fish poultry olive oil wine 5 unhealthy brain foods : red meats butter and margarine cheese pastries and sweets fried or fast food some researchers have found that the two older diets provide protection against dementia as well			1
in the latest study , the @entity12 diet was compared with the two other diets			0
people with high adherence to the @entity65 and @entity64 diets also had reductions in alzheimer 's disease — 39 per cent with the @entity65 diet and 54 per cent with the @entity64 diet			2
however , the diets had negligible benefits when people only adhered to it moderately			0
professor @entity47 added that the @entity12 diet is also easier to follow than the @entity64 diet , which calls for daily consumption of fish and three to four daily servings of fruits and vegetables			0
the @entity12 diet has 15 components , including 10 ' brain - healthy food groups ' — green leafy vegetables , other vegetables , nuts , berries , beans , whole grains , fish , poultry , olive oil and wine			1
it also has five unhealthy groups that comprise red meats , butter and stick margarine , cheese , pastries and sweets , and fried or fast food			1
the @entity12 diet includes at least three servings of wholegrains , a salad and one other vegetable every day — along with a glass of wine			0
it also involves snacking most days on nuts and eating beans every other day or so , poultry and berries at least twice a week and fish at least once a week			1
dieters must limit eating the designated unhealthy foods , eating less than one tablespoon of butter a day and eating cheese , fried or fast food to less than once a week			1
limiting these foods is essential to have a real shot at avoiding the devastating effects of @entity26 's , according to the study			1
berries are the only fruit specifically to make the @entity12 diet			0
professor @entity47 said : ' blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain , ' adding that strawberries have also performed well in past studies of the effect of food on cognitive function			2
the diet suggests 10 brain - healthy foods including wholegrains , salad , vegetables , berries , nuts , beans , olive oil , poultry and fish the @entity12 diet was not an intervention in this study , however ; researchers looked at what people were already eating			1
participants earned points if they ate brain - healthy foods frequently and avoided unhealthy foods			1
the one exception was that participants got one point if they said olive oil was the primary oil used in their homes			1
the study enlisted volunteers already participating in the ongoing @entity202 and @entity203 ( @entity204 ) , which began in 1997 among residents of @entity36 - area retirement communities and senior public housing complexes			0
an optional ' food frequency questionnaire ' was added from 2004 to february 2013 , and the @entity12 diet study looked at results for 923 volunteers			0
the diet advises limiting butter to one tablespoon a day and limiting cheese , pastries , sweets and fast or friend food to once a week a total of 144 cases of alzheimer 's disease developed in this group of people			1
the disease , which takes a devastating toll on cognitive function , is not unlike heart disease in that there appear to be ' many factors that play into who gets the disease , ' including behavioral , environmental and genetic components , professor @entity47 said			0
she continued : ' with late - onset alzheimer 's disease , with that older group of people , genetic risk factors are a small piece of the picture			0
' past studies have yielded evidence that suggests what we eat may play a significant role in determining who gets the illness and who does n't , professor @entity47 added			0
when the researchers in the new study left out of analysis of participants who changed their diets somewhere along the line — say , on a doctor 's orders after a stroke — they found there was a stronger link between the @entity12 diet and more favourable outcomes in terms of alzheimer 's disease			0
the diet 's developer said blueberries are ' one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain ' he said : ' that probably means that people who eat this diet consistently over the years get the best protection			2
' in other words , it looks like the longer a person eats the @entity12 diet , the less risk that person will have of developing @entity26 's , professor @entity47 said			1
as is the case with many health - related habits , including physical exercise , she said , ' you 'll be healthier if you 've been doing the right thing for a long time			0
' she added that the study did not establish a cause and effect relationship between the @entity12 diet and a lowered risk of @entity26 's			1
other studies on different populations would need to be carried out to do this , she said			0
the study was funded by the @entity294 .			0

called the ' @entity10 for @entity11 '
diet even reduces @entity26 's risk by 35 *%* if not meticulously followed
includes 10 healthy food groups like fish , poultry , olive oil , beans and nuts
involves avoiding unhealthy brain foods like cheese , butter and sweets
