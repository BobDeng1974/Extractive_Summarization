former secretary of state @entity0 got her budding presidential campaign 's first targeted question about the deadly 2012 @entity5 terror attacks on tuesday night , and her answer was the sound of one hand clapping			1
the bash - the - rich candidate flew first class from @entity12 to @entity13 after wrapping up a two - day @entity15 campaign trip			2
@entity16 was on the flight			0
' mrs. @entity0 , when are you going to start talking to the press about @entity5 ? ' @entity16 asked her in the @entity21			1
' did you make mistakes ? ' the usually garrulous and broad - smiling @entity23 stared straight ahead , continued walking alongside her @entity25 and local police escorts , and said nothing			1
the two are shown at a ceremony held to receive the remains of the four @entity34 who were killed at the scene moments earlier , she answered a question about why her taxpayer - funded security detail had sped at 80 mph past exits for the smaller @entity53 , @entity15 airport , and trekked all the way to @entity12 for a flight with first class seats			2
' you know , i do n't make the travel arrangements			0
i do n't , ' @entity23 said			0
the @entity61 terror group @entity60 's military - style @entity5 attacks will likely be a thorn in @entity23 's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign season			1
the group laid waste to a @entity69 facility while she was @entity34 's top diplomat			0
a special congressional committee chaired by @entity73 @entity72 rep. @entity72 , a former criminal prosecutor , has a mandate to investigate the episode through january 2017 , making it unlikely that @entity23 will be able to put the issue behind her			1
trouble ahead : @entity15 resident @entity80 included ' @entity5 blood ' tuesday on a sign listing reasons ' @entity0 is a liar , ' near the site of a @entity23 appearance at the @entity86 on sunday during a series of 50 brief interviews with @entity91 students in @entity92 , @entity15 , 22 of them made references to @entity94 when asked about @entity23 's chances of becoming president			1
many of them , like freshman @entity99 , were n't old enough to drive when it happened			0
' i think there was blood on her hands , ' @entity99 told @entity16			0
he said he believes @entity23 's performance before , during and after should disqualify her from holding higher office			2
' i definitely do , ' he said			0
' it shows how she acts under pressure			0
' not forgotten : @entity34 @entity112 the @entity36 @entity113 was the first to die in @entity5 , and was seen by @entity36 as a moderate – angering anti-american hardliners from radical @entity61 groups @entity116 : @entity34 foreign service information management officer @entity122 ( left ) , @entity117 ( center ) and @entity34 @entity121 seal @entity119 ( right ) perished in the @entity60 attacks in @entity5 four @entity34 lost their lives in the september 11 , 2012 terror attacks , including @entity34 ambassador to @entity36 @entity113 , the first @entity34 ambassador killed while on duty since 1979			1
@entity34 @entity128 officer @entity122 also perished in the initial barrage of mortars and automatic weapons fire			0
hours later , a second wave of attacks hit a @entity135 annex compound nearby , killing @entity135 contract soldiers @entity119 and @entity117 , both @entity137			0
the four men came home in flag - draped caskets			1
congressional republicans want answers about @entity23 's involvement in what they see as a potential cover - up of facts surrounding how the attacks unfolded and why – and how the @entity37 administration explained it afterward , just weeks before an election			1
part of the swirling controversy involves a home - brew email server that @entity23 exclusively used for her official electronic communications while she was secretary of state			2
@entity23 never used an official ' state - dot - gov ' email address , but told reporters on march 10 that she had given the @entity69 copes of ' official ' emails – and acknowledged deciding herself which ones qualified			2
she deleted the rest , some 32,000 messages in all			0
@entity23 's attorney has refused to hand over the server to congressional investigators			2
@entity72 , the @entity165 chairman , wants a neutral third - party to examine it and determine if @entity5 - related emails can be recovered			0
his committee said wednesday that its report on the @entity5 attacks wo n't likely be finished until 2016 , putting its release squarely in the middle of the presidential campaign 's most hotly contested months			1
but the committee said in a statement that ' secretary @entity23 ’s decision to seek the presidency of the @entity34 does not and will not impact the work of the committee			2
' @entity23 's @entity69 infamously declined to provide her @entity5 outpost with the beefed - up security presence its station chief requested in the weeks preceding the deadly @entity60 attacks			1
she claimed later that she never saw the requests , insisting that such routine diplomatic cables would never have made it to her desk , even if they were addressed to her			0
first class : @entity0 ( seated at the front , right ) traveled in luxury from @entity12 to @entity13 , seated next to chief of staff @entity193 , after am 80 mph @entity25 dash to @entity196 farewell : @entity0 waved at the end of her final campaign stop in @entity15 on tuesday , before hitting the road to @entity12 for the same @entity13 - bound flight that @entity16 flew on in the days following the attacks , @entity23 said publicly that it was the result of a spontaneous protest over a @entity42 video made by an @entity34 – a film that insulted the @entity44 prophet @entity43			1
such protests were seen in other @entity44 countries , but @entity34 intelligence determined in real - time that the @entity5 attacks were well - organized and easily traced back to an @entity61 terror network			1
months later , following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about @entity5 , she testified in a @entity34 @entity217 hearing			2
just days earlier , lawmakers disclosed that a top @entity34 diplomat told them ' everyone ' at the @entity34 diplomatic outpost in @entity5 knew ' from the beginning ' that they were in the middle of a terrorist attack			1
' the fact is we had four dead @entity34 , ' @entity23 told the senators			0
' was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they ’d they go kill some @entity34 ? ' ' what difference at this point does it make ? '			0

former secretary of state landed tuesday night at @entity21 after a first - class flight from @entity12
@entity23 stared ahead wordlessly , walked and did n't acknowledge questions as @entity16 asked whether she had made mistakes in @entity5
deadly attacks , carried out by an *affiliate* of @entity245 , claimed the lives of @entity34 ambassador to @entity36 @entity113 and three other @entity34 **personnel**
special congressional committee investigating *circumstances* before and after the attacks ; its report will come out during 2016 presidential campaign
questions remain about @entity23 's alleged *failure* to protect her diplomatic outpost , and the reasons she cited for the *debacle* after four flag - draped caskets came home
@entity34 intelligence knew at the time that @entity5 **personnel** were aware they were under attack , but @entity23 and other @entity37 administration officials blamed an out - of - control protest linked to an *anti-islam* @entity42 video
