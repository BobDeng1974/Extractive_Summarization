@entity1 warplanes wiped out @entity3 insurgents menacing @entity5 's @entity4 with five air strikes that widened what @entity7 called a campaign to ultimately defeat the jihadist movement			1
@entity7 has branded @entity3 an acute threat to the @entity12 as well as the @entity13 and said that key @entity15 allies stood ready to back @entity16 in action against the well - armed sectarian force			2
the leader of a pro-iraqi government paramilitary force in western @entity5 said the air strikes destroyed an islamic state patrol trying to attack the dam - @entity5 's second biggest hydroelectric facility that also provides millions with water			1
' they ( the air strikes ) were very accurate			1
there was no collateral damage ... if @entity3 had gained control of the dam , many areas of @entity5 would have been seriously threatened , even ( the capital ) @entity32 , ' sheik @entity30 told @entity36			0
the @entity1 military said in a statement that the strikes destroyed four @entity57 , four is armed vehicles , two of which were carrying anti-aircraft artillery , an is fighting position , one is command post and an is defensive fighting position			1
all aircraft left the strike areas safely , the @entity65 said			0
the strikes were @entity16 's first reported offensive into @entity50 since it started attacks on @entity3 forces in the north of @entity5 in august			1
almost three years after @entity1 troops withdrew from @entity5 and 11 years after their invasion that toppled @entity74 , the war on @entity3 is drawing @entity16 back into the middle of @entity5 's power struggles and bloody sectarian strife			2
defence : @entity81 peshmerga fighters take up position as their tanks ( not pictured ) shell @entity3 controlled areas at the @entity86 front line leading to @entity87 strategy : @entity3 fighters were able to take control of the @entity90 ( pictured ) in northern @entity5 last month , but persistent @entity1 airstrikes later dislodged the militants the head of the @entity94 has urged its members to confront @entity3 extremists ' militarily and politically '			1
the apparent call to arms came as president @entity7 prepares to go to politicians and the @entity1 public with his own plan to stop the militants			1
backing from the 22 - country @entity94 could provide crucial support across the @entity13 for mr @entity7 's effort to assemble an international coalition against @entity106 , which has conquered large parts of @entity5 and @entity108			1
@entity15 forces have already agreed to take on the extremists			0
@entity94 chief @entity111 said what is needed from @entity114 countries is a ' clear and firm decision for a comprehensive confrontation ' with ' cancerous and terrorist ' groups			0
the @entity94 includes @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and the @entity123			0
@entity1 defense secretary @entity124 said the strikes on the @entity127 insurgents had been carried out at the request of the @entity130 - led central government in @entity32			1
' if that dam would fall into ( @entity3 's ) hands or if that dam would be destroyed , the damage that would cause would be very significant and it would put a significant , additional and big risk into the mix in @entity5 , ' @entity131 told reporters during a trip to @entity141 's capital , @entity142			0
@entity7 said on the weekend he would explain to @entity1 this week his plan to ' start going on some offense ' against @entity3			1
' we are going to be a part of an international coalition , carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by @entity5 troops , @entity81 troops , ' he said in an @entity154 interview			1
' we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities			1
we 're going to shrink the territory that they control			2
and ultimately we 're going to defeat ' em. ' the six - month - old battle for control of the @entity4 has been a rare case of co-operation between local @entity127 tribes and the @entity130 - led @entity5 military			2
the @entity166 tribe in @entity4 has a long - standing fight with the @entity3 , which split with its parent organization @entity168 last year			2
@entity50 is complicated terrain for the @entity1 as they seek to root out @entity3 , since @entity170 fighting on behalf of the @entity32 government are the exception to the rule			1
summit : @entity1 defense secretary @entity124 ( left ) with president @entity7 and @entity176 prime minister @entity175 at the @entity15 summit in @entity178 last week @entity3 fighters appear to be using captured @entity1 military - issue arms and weapons supplied to moderate rebels in @entity108 by @entity119 , according to a report published today			2
the study by the @entity186 - based small - arms research organisation @entity185 documented weapons seized by @entity81 forces from militants in @entity5 and @entity108 over a 10 - day period in july			0
the report said the jihadists disposed of ' significant quantities ' of @entity1 - made small arms including @entity195 assault rifles and included photos showing the markings ' property of @entity1 govt '			2
it also found that anti-tank rockets used by @entity106 in @entity108 were ' identical to @entity203 rockets transferred by @entity119 to forces operating under the @entity206 umbrella in 2013 '			0
the rockets were made in the then @entity207 in the 1980s			0
@entity3 is believed to have seized large quantities of weapons from @entity108 military installations it has captured as well as arms supplied by the @entity1 to the @entity5 army after it swept through northern @entity5 in recent weeks			0
the large desert province , bordering @entity108 , @entity120 and @entity119 , has been at war with @entity32 since last december when then - prime minister @entity215 sent troops to raze an anti-government demonstrators ' camp			0
that sparked a tribal revolt against @entity215 whom @entity170 accused of isolating them with indiscriminate arrests			0
@entity3 fighters took advantage of the chaos to muscle in and become the dominant force among @entity170			0
the fighting there , which has displaced 430,000 people since january , strengthened @entity3 ahead of its lightning blitz this summer across the north of @entity5 , also threatening the semi-autonomous , @entity232 - backed enclave of @entity233			0
thriving on @entity215 's sectarian - motivated alienation of @entity170 , @entity3 committed wide - scale atrocities against @entity130 , @entity236 and other non-sunnis this summer as the @entity5 army imploded in the face of the insurgents ' advance			0
since june , @entity3 has massacred hundreds of soldiers outside of @entity74 's hometown , @entity243 , after capturing it , and killed a similar number of @entity245 and other religious minorities outside of @entity87 , the north 's biggest city			0
@entity7 ordered air strikes in northern @entity5 last month as @entity81 - controlled territory fell to the @entity3 and the capital of @entity233 looked in endangered			1
last weekend , @entity1 warplanes carried out raids farther south in the province of @entity254 to break an @entity3 siege of the @entity257 town of @entity258 .			1

@entity1 warplanes carried out five air strikes on militants near @entity4
destroyed four @entity263 , anti-aircraft artillery and a command post
strikes are first into @entity50 since it started attacks in august
@entity7 vows to ' systematically degrade @entity106 capabilities , shrink its territory '
@entity275 urges members to tackle @entity277 ' militarily and politically '
