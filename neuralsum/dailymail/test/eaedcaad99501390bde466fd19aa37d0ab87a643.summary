@entity0 and @entity1 submitted plans to their council for a 12 - seater home cinema they 're newlyweds settling down in their dream home , and this weekend it was reported that @entity0 and @entity8 have submitted plans to improve their £ 10million @entity10 mansion - which include the addition of a 12 - seater cinema			1
while this may seem extravagant , according to industry experts , a cinema room is now an ' expected ' luxury in properties worth over £ 10million			1
@entity18 , co-founding director of top luxury property developer @entity19 explained : ' home cinemas are a growing requirement , particularly for brand new or newly refurbished properties			0
' ' at the high level , media rooms are a valuable use of space and are expected , particularly in homes priced above £ 10 million			1
we also often include pantries or bars as an addition to support the media room			0
' as extravagant as it may seem , home cinemas are often a clever investment as they make use of low value space in the dark basement			0
property insider , @entity40 , an asset manager at @entity41 explains : ' cinemas are often situated in the basement of a dwelling because there is no need for natural light			0
' @entity40 estimates that cinemas can cost anything from a few thousand to £ 100,000 to kit out and says : ' home cinemas can vary from a converted surplus bedroom within an average sized dwelling to a 30 - seater theatre in the basement of a much larger home			1
' there 's a vast difference in the set - up costs depending on how far you want to go , ' he said			0
@entity40 believes that the home cinema trend is growing , and having a dedicated cinema room is becoming ' important ' in high - end properties			2
but does it ever reap financial rewards when it comes to selling ? ' if one was to spend fortunes investing in a cinema equipment for an average sized family home - the chances are it will not add any value to the house as a majority of the purchasers will have different uses for that room , ' @entity40 said			2
generally though it adds saleability factor rather than actual value			0
' set - ups can range from large plasma tvs with off - the - shelf surround sound systems in a darkened rooms to tiered theatres with cinema quality digital projectors			1
' high - end cinemas will have been constructed to consider the rest of the house and can be soundproofed to prevent noise problems occurring elsewhere , which also increases the cost			2
' all apartments in the super-prime development in one @entity115 have access to this amazing home cinema			0
a three - bedroom apartment is currently on the letting market with @entity120 at ... £ 17,000 per week knowing how hard renovations can be we thought we 'd give the @entity123 some inspiration on how to kit out their new entertainment room			2
as these images show the home cinema is generally of a neutral hue with warm wood finishes to give it that authentic feel			0
but it 's not only interior decisions @entity0 and @entity1 will have to grapple with , questions involving audiophile speakers , sub woofers , heat management systems and aerospace grade mirrors ( for the projector , not @entity1 ) will also have to be discussed at length			1
the @entity142 renovation plans also include upgrades to the library , gym , spa , steam room , wine cellar , boat house as well as a new swimming pool , pool house and grand terrace			0
this bright home cinema is located in the basement of an eight - bedroom mansion on @entity156 , @entity157 , is currently on the rental market with estate agents @entity160 individual armchairs is the seating arrangement of choice for home cinemas and mood lighting adds to the authentic feel interior designers @entity166 turned this small spare room into a cosy home cinema metallic wall coverings , fur cushions and @entity173 portraits add a little razzle dazzle to the interior a cinema room in @entity178 ’s latest £ 16m mansion in @entity179 , @entity180			1
the 14 - seater cinema has a 10 - foot wide screen , plush leather reclining seats and a dramatic cocktail bar with backlit onyx paneling this cinema room in @entity187 has padded suede , dark wood and @entity173 greats on the wall this comparatively modest cinema room in a house on @entity194 in @entity180 's @entity195 has a 108in screen and a @entity198 projector			1

@entity0 and @entity1 submitted plans for a 12 - seater cinema , as part of upgrades to their @entity10 mansion
property expert says media rooms ' expected ' in homes over £ 10million and can cost anything up to £ 100,000
