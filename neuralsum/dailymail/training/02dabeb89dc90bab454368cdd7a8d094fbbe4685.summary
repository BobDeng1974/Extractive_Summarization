the @entity0 will hold talks with @entity4 team sponsors @entity2 to revamp the fans ’ man of the match award derailed by online voters for both the @entity9 and @entity10 games			1
@entity4 supporters made a mockery of @entity2 ’s fans engagement initiative by making goalkeeper @entity14 on each occasion despite him rarely touching the ball in either @entity18 qualifier			1
@entity14 was voted man of the match in both of @entity4 's games against @entity9 and @entity10 fans voted for @entity14 as their man of the match not once but twice and @entity4 could change the system the @entity0 / @entity2 view is that a one - off cheeky protest about the @entity9 mismatch where 63 per cent of the vote went to @entity14 was fair enough but not when it was repeated in @entity30 when an 82 per cent majority picked the @entity33 player			1
@entity2 are keen to keep the fans centrally involved in the vote , but need to work on a safety procedure that guards against ridiculous choices being made in future			1
tv rights holders @entity39 choose the official @entity2 man of the match award at @entity42 and co-commentator @entity43 went for @entity44 after the stroll against @entity9			1
the graphic shows that @entity14 received 82 per cent of the fans votes for man of the match against @entity10 @entity44 was named @entity2 's official man of the match by @entity39 commentator @entity43 @entity52 ’s media team are holding a beauty parade of @entity55 companies in @entity56 this week involving @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			1
@entity52 say they are looking for an agency to do corporate event and branding work for them			0
but the four firms also have crisis management departments that could be very useful with @entity52 facing the fallout from the @entity69 report and tricky @entity70 in @entity71 and @entity72			0
@entity73 , @entity74 ’s wealthy chief executive who earned £ 2.19million in the last financial year , will face embarrassing questions at the club ’s annual meeting on thursday as to why sub-contracted workers at the @entity79 are paid less than the minimum @entity56 living wage of £ 8.80 per hour			1
@entity74 say none of their direct employees have wages of less than that figure			2
but there are lower paid cleaners and catering staff who work for @entity74 - contracted companies who are responsible for their hourly wage			2
but the question submitted to the board says @entity74 ’s strong financial resources and long tradition for doing things the right way should mean all personnel working at the club should be paid the @entity56 living wage			2
@entity74 chief executive @entity73 will face some tricky questions at the club 's annual meeting the mystery continues of just who leaked to @entity106 that first doctored draft of a document being prepared for the @entity109 by former @entity0 lawyer @entity110 of @entity111 to potentially counter @entity113 ’s book claims			1
@entity106 hired solicitors @entity114 to state it was n’t the @entity109 or @entity116 that gave them it , but will not reveal the source			0
long - term @entity120 ? neither the @entity121 nor @entity123 ’s legal advisors involved in negotiating the terms will divulge whether there is a break clause in the astonishing six - year contracts awarded to him and his coaches			0
but surely — like in other long - term deals for national team bosses — there are ‘ liquidating damages ’ clauses inserted allowing both sides to extricate themselves			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. the @entity137 and @entity138 fraud forum have picked @entity139 of all places as the venue for their annual conference next month			2
a spokesman said the location was to do with its size and parking facilities and nothing to do with @entity151 owner @entity150 ’s travails or former managing director @entity152 having spent nearly five months in a @entity154 jail			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. the @entity0 ’s doomed international committee is so dysfunctional the only member of the 12 - strong group in @entity10 was @entity159 ’s @entity158			1
the @entity160 kicked @entity158 , who is now only a vice-president at @entity159 , off the committee in the summer because they wanted to be represented by board members			0
yet he has somehow returned as a @entity164 representative			0
@entity166 ’s @entity165 was the @entity0 choice from candidates from the @entity164 and the @entity160 to become the senior communications manager liaising between the @entity4 team and the media			1
his social skills were viewed as important after his highly combative predecessor @entity173 , now at @entity174 , fell out with the @entity4 press corps in @entity176 .			2
