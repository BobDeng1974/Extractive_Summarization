super-hydrating coconut water may have been the health drink to be seen with this year			1
but in 2015 , it ’s birch water , a drink extracted from silver birch trees , that looks set to overtake it in the popularity stakes			2
why ? well , it ’s thanks to its array of potential health and beauty benefits			1
with only 18 calories per 100ml , birch water contains lots of important , naturally occurring nutrients , such as antioxidant vitamin c , rehydrating potassium , immune system - boosting zinc , and copper — thought to have anti-ageing benefits			2
the thin , watery sap is tapped from birch tree trunks in early spring and has been a popular drink and herbal remedy in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and even some parts of @entity30 for centuries			1
no wonder it ’s recently become the fashionable health drink du jour in the @entity54 , where birch water is now found not just in cafes , gyms and healthfood stores , but is even on sale in petrol station chiller cabinets			2
currently only available online in the @entity63 , it is expected to take off here next year , becoming as ubiquitous as coconut water			1
according to professor @entity67 ( pictured ) , the trees were able to absorb more than 50 per cent of the particulate dust — linked to respiratory problems — from passing traffic , much more than other species but what , exactly , is in this magic elixir and why does it have such an impressive reputation ? according to the website of @entity79 , one of the biggest @entity54 birch water brands , the basic nutritional profile of birch water is very similar to its coconut cousin — but with a couple of impressive nutritional extras			2
it is also infused with natural sugars , protective antioxidant vitamins , hydrating electrolytes ( nutrients like potassium that help the body to rehydrate itself ) and trace minerals such as copper , calcium , zinc and magnesium			0
unlike coconut water , birch water also contains compounds called saponins , which are said to have powerful cholesterol - reducing properties			1
unlike coconut water ( pictured ) , birch water also contains compounds called saponins , which are said to have powerful cholesterol - reducing properties ‘ saponins are found mainly in legumes such as soya beans and peas , ’ says @entity106 , of the @entity107			1
‘ there is some research to suggest that saponins may help to lower cholesterol levels , although these claims have still not been approved by the @entity117			0
’ the other super-ingredient that birch water boasts and coconut water does not is xylitol — a sweetener with 40 per cent fewer calories than sugar			1
used commercially as a low - calorie sweetener in chewing gum , toothpastes and mouthwashes , xylitol — which reduces tooth decay and strengthens enamel — is found in useful amounts ( around 1 to 2 per cent ) — in birch water			0
so where does birch sap come from ? most of the commercially sold birch water is sustainably harvested , by hand , in huge organic forests in @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity79 water , for example , comes mostly from @entity141 , while @entity142 , another popular brand , comes from @entity144			0
the window for harvest is incredibly short and unpredictable : only a few weeks in early spring , when the climate is right and the sap starts to run up the trees to nourish budding leaves , will supply large quantities of the water			1
depending on the weather , and how well the trees have been growing , up to four gallons of sap can be taken from a tree for several consecutive days			0
it is collected in much the same way as maple syrup — from a simple tap driven into the trunk			0
the trees are then carefully plugged so as not to damage them			0
unlike maple syrup , which is boiled down to intensify its sweetness , birch water is usually bottled with no more than a little light pasteurisation to extend its shelf life			0
the result tastes very fresh — like super-clean spring water , with a subtle underlying sweetness and woody aftertaste			0
@entity79 birch water ( pictured ) originates from @entity141 and is one of the biggest @entity54 birch water brands and has a similar nutritional profile to coconut water it would be all too easy to be cynical , but it ’s worth remembering that birch extracts have been widely used , and valued for their natural health benefits — particularly for urinary tract problems , arthritis and hair loss — for hundreds of years			1
and a recent study by @entity185 , also showed the tree ’s amazing detoxifying capabilities when they planted silver birch trees between a street of houses and a busy road			0
according to professor @entity67 , the trees were able to absorb more than 50 per cent of the particulate dust — linked to respiratory problems — from passing traffic , much more than other species , such as oak			0
so should we all rush out to buy birch water ? @entity106 says : ‘ it ’s definitely healthier than sugary soft drinks , even if some of the more sensational health claims ca n’t yet be substantiated			2
