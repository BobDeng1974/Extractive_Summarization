by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 06:04 est , 5 october 2012 ecologists have released hundreds of @entity3 's largest breed of spider into the wild - which can grow to eight centimetres			0
the great raft spider has been saved by a breeding programme involving ten zoos			1
with a leg span of up to 8cm , the arachnid is capable of catching and eating a fish as it glides across the surface of water			0

they can grow to 8cm long as with most spiders , the female is the larger sex			1
this semiaquatic creature dines on small water - based insect larvae , sticklebacks , tadpoles and other small spiders			2
just three populations are believed to exist in the @entity3 after they were ravaged by agricultural drainage			0
around 200 baby spiders have already been released at the @entity32 's @entity31 near @entity33			2
ecologist dr @entity34 said : ' most invertebrate groups do n't receive a lot of conservation effort			0
' the ones that tend to receive the attention are the big and spectacular ones ... this is very much the case with great raft spiders			1
' they 're big , they 're beautiful and they have to fly the flag for other species			0
' funding from @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50 hopes to reintroduce the spider to the @entity52 , where it was once commonplace			1
instead of being raised in their usual nursery webs , suspended from wetland plants , the tiny animals were individually housed in test tubes - where iron - willed volunteers fed them by mouth			1
@entity18 keeper @entity62 raised 170 of the arachnids , using a special tube operated with her mouth to feed the tiny critters dead flies			1
she said : ' it does take a lot of time			0

the great raft spider can reach sizes of 8cm ' you have to be careful to make sure they 've got enough humidity to be able to moult			1
' @entity62 even had favourite spiders - which in the wild are capable of catching a stickleback			2
dr @entity34 said : ' having invested their summer into feeding them individually , people do get quite attached			0
' but when you return the next year and see 500 to 700 babies , it 's worth the effort			0
' the ecologist , who has 20 years ' experience working with raft spiders , says the conservation programme is designed to give the spiders the best chance in the wild - boosting survival rates by as much as 90 per cent			1
she said : ' we 're all improving our captive - rearing expertise through this process			0
' it 's early days			0
' we 're two years down the line now but the indications are that the spiders are settled in well			2

the spiders were once commonplace in the @entity52 , and researchers hope they will flourish again			1
previous batches of spiderlings released have been discovered to be breeding well in the fen , and four nursery webs were spotted , each containing around 200 tiny spiders			2
dr @entity34 said : ' with animals that are this rare you can make lots of arguments about food chains and food webs , and how important that is			0
' we simply do n't know what pulling out one brick will do further down the heap			0
' the spiders can live up to two and a half years , but thankfully they will not be appearing in bathtubs any time soon , as they can not survive outside their marshland habitat			0

plans will see them reintroduced to the @entity52
