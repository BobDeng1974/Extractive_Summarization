by @entity0 scientists have identified a brain discovered last year as belonging to the world ’s first predator			1
the exquisitely preserved brain was found in a fossil of the creature that lived in the @entity8 , around 520 million years ago			1
the discovery reveals a brain that is surprisingly simple and less complex than those known from fossils of some of the animal ’s prey			2
scientists have identified a fossil 520 million years old as a brain belonging to the world 's earliest predator , known as @entity21			1
on the left here can be seen neural structures in the head of the animal , including the brain			0
on the right is the fossil , a nearly complete specimen of the ancient predator the find for the first time identifies the fossilised brain of what are considered the top predators of their time , a group of animals known as anomalocaridids , which translates to ' abnormal shrimp			1
' the fossil of the world 's earliest predator , named @entity21 , was found in 2013 near @entity46 in the @entity48 province of @entity49			1
it is what is known as an anomalocaridid , which translates as an ' abnormal shrimp '			0
just over five inches ( 13 centimetres ) long , @entity21 was dwarfed by some of the larger anomalocaridids , which reached more than three feet ( one metre ) in length			2
paleontologists excavating lower cambrian rocks in southern @entity59 found that some anomalocaridids had huge compound eyes , up to 10 times larger than the biggest dragonfly eye , meaning they were probably highly efficient hunters			0
long extinct , these fierce - looking arthropods were first discovered as fossils in the late 19th century but not properly identified until the early 1980s			0
they still have scientists arguing over where they belong in the tree of life			0
‘ our discovery helps to clarify this debate , ’ said professor @entity70 , director of the @entity71 's @entity73 and senior author of the paper about the findings			0
‘ it turns out the top predator of the @entity8 had a brain that was much less complex than that of some of its possible prey and that looked surprisingly similar to a modern group of rather modest worm - like animals			1
’ the new species has been given the name @entity89 for ' piny - clawed lyre - shaped predator ’			2
the brain suggests it is related to a branch of animals whose living descendants are known as onychophorans or velvet worms			1
these wormlike animals are equipped with stubby unjointed legs that end in a pair of tiny claws			0
the fossil of the world 's earliest predator , named @entity21 , was found in 2013 near @entity46 in the @entity48 province of @entity49 at @entity107 this artist 's impression of @entity110 , one of the species of the world 's first predators , the anomalocaridids , shows it chasing its possible prey , primitive fish that also existed in the @entity8 520 million years ago			1
the creature was likely about five inches ( 13 centimetres ) long velvet worms , which are also exclusively predators , grow to no more than a few inches in length and are mostly found in the @entity122 , where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of beetles and other small insects , their preferred prey			1
two long feelers extend from the head , attached in front of a pair of small eyes			0
the anomalocaridid fossil resembles the anatomy of today 's velvet worms in several ways , according to @entity70 and his collaborators			1
the worms have a simple brain located in front of the mouth and a pair of ganglia - a collection of nerve cells - located in the front of the optic nerve and at the base of their long feelers			0
‘ and - surprise , surprise - that is what we also found in our fossil , ’ @entity70 said , pointing out that anomalocaridids had a pair of clawlike grasping appendages in front of the eyes			0
‘ these top predators in the @entity8 are defined by just their single pair of appendages , wicked - looking graspers , extending out from the front of their head			0
‘ these are totally different from the antennae of insects and crustaceans			0
‘ such frontally disposed appendages are not found in any other living animals with the exception of velvet worms			1
’ the similarities of their brains and other attributes suggest that the anomalocaridid predators could have been very distant relatives of today 's velvet worms			1
' the ancient predator is believed to have a similar neuro - anatomy to modern velvet worms ( pictured ) , which are also exclusively predators , grow to no more than a few inches in length and are mostly found in the @entity122 , where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of prey this drawing shows the flattened , fossilised trace of the brain of the ancient predator			1
the x-like structure in the head denotes the fossilised brain			2
two dark round spots represent the optic ganglia with nerves that lead from the eyestalks into the head , while the main brain region is in front of the mouth @entity210 of the @entity211 in @entity212 , a co-author on the paper , added : ‘ this is another contribution towards the new field of research we call neuropaleontology			0
' these grasping appendages are a characteristic feature of this most celebrated @entity8 animal group , whose affinity with living animals has troubled evolutionary scientists for almost a century			2
' @entity210 continued that the discovery of the preserved brain helps to clarify similarities with the modern velvet worms			1
' being able to directly associate appendages with parts of the brain in @entity8 animals is a huge advantage , ' said co-author @entity236 , also at the @entity211			2
' for many years now paleontologists have struggled with the question of how different kinds of appendages in @entity8 fossils line up with each other and with what we see in living arthropods			2
' now for the first time , we did n't have to rely just on the external form of the appendages and their sequence in the head to try and sort out segmental identities , but we can draw on the same tool kit we use for extant arthropods - the brain			0

a fossilised brain found near @entity46 in @entity48 has been identified
scientists revealed it belonged to an ancient predator called @entity21
this lived in the @entity8 about 520 million years ago
the predator 's brain was surprisingly less complex than some of its prey
and the *incredibly* well preserved brain shows how the species is a distant relative of animals alive today called velvet worms
