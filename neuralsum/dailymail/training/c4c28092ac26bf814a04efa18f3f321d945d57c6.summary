@entity0 last night ruled out replacing @entity1 as @entity3 leader , saying he would ‘ never ’ take the job			1
the popular former home secretary threw mr @entity1 a lifeline by warning rebel mps that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted			1
it comes after claims up to one in five of mr @entity1 's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go , with mr @entity0 favourite as a caretaker leader			1
pollsters @entity19 found that only 34 per cent of people who voted @entity3 at the last general election believe mr @entity1 is up to the job of prime minister , compared to 51 per cent just a month ago			1
the sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted @entity3 in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader			1
an opinion poll by @entity30 put @entity3 on just 29 per cent , the same level of support secured by @entity33 in the 2010 general election			1
senior @entity3 figures have publicly admitted the party is having ' jitters ' about mr @entity1 's stewardship of the party , and have issued a put up or shut up plea for plotters to ' show us your colours '			1
in an article for @entity46 , former home secretary @entity0 ruled out ever running for @entity3 leader			1
he said : ' @entity1 will lead us into an election that i am convinced we can win			2
it was my decision to walk away from frontline politics , not @entity1 ’s			2
' he knows that while i wo n’t return , i will do everything i can from the backbenches to put @entity3 into government , and @entity1 into 10 @entity55			2
' the position of @entity3 leader has been vacated twice during my time as a member of parliament			2
both times i chose not to stand			0
i happen to think that a better person took this onerous role on each occasion			0
' i have never stood for the leadership of my party – and for the avoidance of doubt , regardless of the circumstances , i never will			0
' yesterday mr @entity1 attempted to brush off the reports , saying he agreed that ' you should n't believe everything you read in the papers '			0
asked if he agreed there was a ' crisis of confidence ' in his leadership , he replied curtly : ' no. ' mr @entity1 received a major boost when mr @entity0 gave the clearest statement yet that he would not take the reins			1
‘ i have never stood for the leadership of my party , and for the avoidance of doubt , regardless of the circumstances , i never will , ’ he told @entity46			0
his comments are a blow to rebel mps who want mr @entity1 to go for the sake of the party , as mr @entity0 is viewed as one of the few figures who could unite @entity3 in the six months before the election			1
mr @entity0 said mr @entity1 was ‘ entitled to our loyalty ’			1
but he revealed that he had turned down mr @entity1 ’s request to take a senior front line role in the election campaign , saying that he would only offer informal help from the backbenches			2
earlier , mr @entity1 attempted to get on the front foot after enduring days of sniping from his own side , by giving a major speech on @entity100 to the @entity101			0
but his woes pursued him to the business organisation ’s conference in @entity105 , where one delegate asked him whether he now wished he had lost the leadership to his elder brother @entity108			0
‘ certainly not , ’ mr @entity1 snapped back			0
a new opinion poll by @entity30 put @entity3 on just 29 per cent , the same level of support secured by @entity33 in the 2010 general election @entity114 business secretary @entity113 senior @entity3 figures publicly rallied behind @entity1			1
but their attempt to shore up mr @entity1 's position risked being derailed when shadow business secretary @entity113 - widely tipped as a possible future leader - appeared to muddle him up with his elder brother @entity108			1
mr @entity113 admitted there were ' noises off ' about mr @entity1 's leadership , but told @entity125 's today programme : ' it is a small minority of people , who are doing so anonymously and off the record			1
' however , in a later interview , mr @entity113 appeared to mix @entity1 up with brother @entity108 , who he defeated by a narrow margin in the 2010 contest for the leadership			1
the shadow business secretary told @entity134 : ' i know , for my constituency , ( we have ) a united @entity3 in ensuring that we get @entity108 , um , that we get @entity1 into no 10			1
i know ultimately that that 's what 's going to make a difference to their lives			0
' mr attempted to laugh off the speculation about his position , recalling a conversation with @entity101 president sir @entity147			0
‘ i always remember him saying to me , “ @entity1 , you should n’t believe everything you read in the newspapers ”			0
it wo n’t surprise you to know that i rather agree with that just at the moment			0
’ shadow home secretary @entity154 dismissed suggestions that she was preparing for a leadership bid as ‘ complete nonsense ’			1
the new poll showed support for @entity3 has slipped to 29 per cent – the same level achieved by @entity33 in his 2010 election defeat			1
the poll , conducted for former @entity163 treasurer @entity30 , put the conservatives on 30 per cent , @entity3 on 29 , @entity164 on 16 and the @entity165 on 10			2
lord @entity30 said polling now consistently showed that while @entity167 is an electoral ‘ asset ’ to the @entity163 , mr @entity1 is a ‘ drag ’ on @entity3 ’s fortunes			2
but two other polls last night gave @entity3 a narrow lead			0
a @entity174 poll put @entity3 on 36 and the @entity175 on 34 , while an @entity177 poll put @entity3 on 32 and the @entity175 on 31			0
however , the @entity177 poll for the @entity46 , found mr @entity1 ’s personal ratings had hit a new low			0
it found that 63 per cent of voters think the @entity3 leader is doing badly , while just 21 per cent think he is doing well			2
the minus 42 rating is three percentage points lower than his previous worst result in june this year and will give fresh ammunition to the rebels			0
@entity3 mp @entity188 said mr @entity1 ’s personal unpopularity was ‘ an issue ’ on the doorstep			2
he added : ‘ any @entity3 mp who says otherwise simply has n’t been talking to their electorate			0
’ but mr @entity1 ’s allies are increasingly bullish about his ability to survive			0
last night loyalist mps rallied behind him at a meeting of the @entity198 in @entity199			0
@entity200 also launched a belated attempt to shore up mr @entity1			0
shadow business secretary @entity113 admitted there were ‘ noises off ’ about mr @entity1 ’s leadership , but added : ‘ it is a small minority of people , who are doing so anonymously and off the record			1
’ in an apparent slip , he said : ‘ i know , for my constituency , ( we have ) a united @entity3 in ensuring that we get @entity108 , um , that we get @entity1 into no 10			2
