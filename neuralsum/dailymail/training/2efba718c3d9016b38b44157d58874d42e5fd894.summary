ms @entity9 's friends and family always have bottles of ketchup for her as they ' do n't want any trouble ' and she is so obsessed with tomato sauce she even eats it straight from a spoon as a quick fix			1
but she insists it does n't ruin the taste of her meals and that she can still appreciate all the flavours in the food she eats			2
she said : ' it takes me five minutes to dress my plate with sauce , i just love it			2

' tomatoes have long been considered a health super-food			0
they contain lycopene , an antioxidant associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer			0
some believe it may contribute to the general healthy functioning of the gland , which is integral in sexual function			0
