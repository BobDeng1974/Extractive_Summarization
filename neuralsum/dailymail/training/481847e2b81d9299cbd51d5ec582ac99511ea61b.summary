by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 12:30 est , 16 november 2012 ah , @entity2 dinner , that famous feast of edible fairy lights , red scotch egg baubles , frankincense and myrrh broth , ice cold mulled wine and nitrogen - poached meringues which look like snowballs but taste like pine trees			1
welcome to the topsy - turvy festive table of chef @entity14 , a new treat from the mad scientist of cooking , who may have failed his chemistry o - level at school but has more than made up for it since by introducing the world to the whizzbang world of molecular gastronomy			2
for the first time ever @entity14 will be hosting a special @entity2 lunch in his flagship restaurant in @entity26 , @entity27 this @entity2 , @entity14 is laying on a bonkers feast of completely doolally dimensions at his flagship @entity26 restaurant , the three @entity32 - starred @entity27			1
the 12 - course tasting menu lunch in @entity34 costs £ 300 , excluding alcohol , and will be held over three sundays in december ( 2 , 9 , 16 )			1
the @entity27 - known for its year - round £ 195 tasting menu which features dishes such as snail porridge , the @entity40 's @entity39 , red cabbage gazpacho , salmon poached in liquorice gel and @entity44 , which involves listening to an @entity45 while you eat - will offer a unique @entity2 experience designed by @entity14 and his busy team to celebrate the festive season			1
a standard @entity2 turkey lunch ...			1
. very unlike what you will get in @entity26 this december diners will be treated to brand new dishes including a christmas tree decorated with edible pork scotch egg baubles ; savoury lollies ( @entity59 rocket , salmon twister and mulled wine feast ) ; and something called the @entity63 which involves dropping a gold bar into broth			1
there 's also edible snow , partridge with pear , edible tinsel , nitro - scrabled egg and bacon ice cream , and plates named @entity74 and like a kid in a @entity76			0
speaking to @entity77 , @entity14 said : ' the man - power involved in making the @entity2 menu is phenomenal			1
it 's a lot of work			0
if you started from scratch , the time it would take one person to make one menu would be about 10 days			2
luckily we have a whole team doing it ! ' pigeon with pistachio , on a standard tasting menu at @entity27 @entity93 @entity95 - poached pine aperetif savoury lollies snail porridge @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 tanned @entity101 @entity102 hot & iced spiced cider @entity105 @entity108 - scrabled egg and bacon ice cream @entity74 like a kid in a sweet shop the @entity27 's @entity2 lunch is being held on the 2 , 9 and 16 december			1
it costs £ 300 per person , excluding alcohol and service			1

describing the impetus behind his festive feast , @entity14 said : ' i 'm basically a big kid			2
i 'm not a scientist - i failed chemistry o - level - i 'm just a bloke who likes to know how things work			0
' and i think @entity124 brings out the kids in all of us - that excitement and the smells and the memories			0
we 've had a lot of fun making edible @entity2 decorations like gold and silver and red baubles that hang on a tree , edible tinsel , edible snow ... we 're still working on the edible fairy lights			1
' the idea is that each table gets a little tree at the beginning of the meal to pick at			0
like a selection of canapes			0
' the baubles are coated in coloured jelly , so there is a scotch egg one coated in red pepper and cardamom jelly , and one covered in edible glitter			0
another one is blown sugar			0
' @entity160 , home to @entity14 's three dining rooms , covered in snow the @entity27 's chicken - not your average sunday lunch and things do n't stop there : ' later in the meal there are things like a little gold bar you drop in a gold - flecked broth of frankincense and myrrh ; cutlery wrapped in fish leather and a partridge smoked over coconut shells served with chipolatas that are filled with celeriac and pear			1
' then there are the liquid nitrogen - poached meringues that look like snowballs but actually taste like @entity2 trees , and a glass of mulled wine that is hot when you drink from one side , and ice cold when you drink from the other			1
it looks like one liquid but it 's actually two			0
' my favourite thing on the menu is the @entity105 , a bunch of balls that look like grapes , developed using the flavour molecules in @entity207 wine , but each one tastes completely different			2
' mrs @entity210 's @entity209 on the standard taster menu at @entity27 @entity14 in @entity26 outside @entity27 , left , and @entity213 pub just over the road , right over in the @entity26 pubs he runs over the road - @entity213 and the @entity32 - starred @entity2 is in the air too			1
' we worked with a @entity220 perfumier called @entity221 and developed the @entity222 - a mix of apple and cinnamon and pine - which we 're pumping into the @entity227			1
' on the 17 and the 18 december the pub will transform its upstairs private dining room into @entity231 's grotto with delicious bites and gifts and the opportunity to meet @entity231 himself			2
children can have a present from @entity231 for £ 10			2
the chef adds the final touches to a dish in his three @entity32 starred restaurant @entity14 - who is entirely self - taught and whose first paid job as a chef was when he opened @entity27 - does occasionally step back and see the ' ridiculousness ' of the situations he finds himself in			1
' i 'm a big picker , as is the nature of my job , so have to be careful not to eat too many carbohydrates			0
last night i had some roast chicken with lentils , but i do have a weakness for pork pies			0
what can i say ? i 'm a kid of the @entity257 so i do love a bit of food kitsch			0
' he said : ' it 's quite funny when i talk really seriously about the hurdles we come up against in certain situations , and then i step back and take a look			0
' i remember once having such a conversation about the logistics of a certain dish while i was literally stuffing live blackbirds into a massive pie			0
and there are a lot of moments like that in my life			0
' it 's funny because i always wanted to be a chef , but i never for a second imagined it would be anything like this			0
and it was never the case that i was really ambitious and desperate to succeed - it was always more that i just had an enormous fear of failing			0
' @entity14 setting fire to his enormous @entity2 pudding at @entity286 in @entity287 , @entity288 , as part of @entity291 's new series , @entity14 's @entity292 @entity14 's @entity293 - the chef 's foray into creating super- super-supersized culinary offerings - is currently screening on @entity291 , and has seen the imaginative chap creating a giant boiled egg and toasted soldiers ( actually cake to dunk in mango mousse and yogurt ) and an enormous @entity2 pudding			2
but what will the man himself be making for @entity2 lunch ? ' i certainly do n't go as overboard as i do in the restaurant ! i tend to make chicken or goose - i like goose with black pudding , confit legs , roast potatoes and red cabbage , and if i 'm doing chicken i 'll make green cabbage			1
' it 's very decadent but @entity2 is the one time of the year when i have truffles			2
i 'll take one from the restaurant and just grate the whole thing over everything ! ' @entity14 hard at work over a plate of shells , sea foam and @entity45 inside the @entity327 at @entity227 by the fireplace at @entity213			1
