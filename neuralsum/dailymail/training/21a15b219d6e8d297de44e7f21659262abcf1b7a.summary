the automaker has resorted to using social media and making phone calls eight months after it began recalling more than two million vehicles			1
there has been heavy publicity surrounding the recall , including thousands of news stories and five congressional hearings , but it seems that the message is still not getting through			1
as a result , @entity0 has been forced to go beyond the usual ominous - sounding recall letters			1
it has sent out @entity2 messages and made phone calls to owners of the cars , mainly @entity37 and @entity38			2
ceo @entity20 has even sent a personal letter urging people to get the switches replaced			1
' in some cases we 've gone to the owners ' home and gotten the vehicle , gave them a loaner , and are working to fix it , ' ms @entity20 said last week			1
@entity0 announced in february and march that it was recalling the cars after taking more than a decade to disclose the defect , now linked to at least two dozen deaths			1
it explained that the ignition switches can wear from heavy , dangling keys			1
if the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces , the switches can suddenly change from the ' run ' position to ' accessory ' or ' off '			1

busy with moving back to her hometown from college and starting a new job , she ignored them both			0
' i did n't think it was very serious just from the wording on the recall notice , ' said ms @entity80 , 24			1
' i 'm sure that it was important			0
i did n't get a sense of what the actual issue was , just neglected to do it			0
' ms @entity80 said her fiance is mad at her for dallying			0
now , she has made an appointment to bring her car into the shop this week			0

repairs finally began in april when the replacement switches started to arrive at dealers			1
last wednesday , @entity0 announced that @entity109 had made enough to fix all the cars			0
@entity20 said the challenge now is to find those people who ' have still not called the dealership and said , " hey , let 's get my car scheduled			1
" ' @entity0 's extraordinary efforts to reach people were part of an agreement that ended a federal investigation into why the automaker failed to promptly disclose the switch problem			1
it is not unusual for some car owners to ignore recall notices			2

but few recalls are as serious as this one			0
@entity139 , left and @entity140 , right , both died in october 2006 following a crash in @entity65 @entity143 , the lawyer handling compensation claims for @entity0 , on monday raised the number of deaths attributed to the defect to 24			2

among the 24 is @entity152 law student @entity151 , 27 , who died in march when her 2006 @entity154 rear - ended a tractor - trailer and caught fire on @entity157 while she was on her way to work as a law clerk for a federal judge			0
witnesses told her family 's lawyer , @entity164 , that the air bags did not inflate , an indication of a defective switch			0
at the time of the crash , @entity0 had announced the recall and was sending warning letters			1
but the parts were not yet available			0

among the most recent cases settled is that of seven year old @entity103 , from @entity179 , @entity180			0

about one - third of those who have not had the repairs done are people with children , while one - fifth are young people without children , @entity0 spokesman @entity206 said			1
usually those people who do not get their cars repaired are the ones who have not seen any symptoms , said @entity218 , senior editor for the @entity220 automotive website			2
