' @entity66 added : ' disgusting fashion shoot glamorising rape in @entity7			1
now rapists will think they are fashionable studs			1
' ' a way of throwing light on the issue ' : mr @entity10 denied the shoot was inspired by the @entity29 bus attack but said he wanted highlight the dangers for women in a way that he knew how outrage : critics took to @entity80 to express their disgust at the photo shoot mr @entity10 , who is @entity7 , issued a robust defence of his project and attacked his critics for misinterpreting his attempt to highlight the dangers facing women in @entity7			1
in a statement to @entity90 , he said : ' in today 's times when freedom of speech and expression is ripped off from a person merely through social media , it is a plight for an artist to keep his work in perspective and independent of public opinion			2

i still strongly stand by work			0
' mr @entity10 denied trying to replicate the @entity48 attack but said his aim was to focus on the plight of the poor who are often forced to take public transport			1
he added : ' being a part of society , it breaks my heart to see my mother , my friends , my sister constraining themselves professionally and personally just to be safe			0

' i believe that i have managed to achieve my goal of starting dialogue on these issues			0
if the cost to set the ball rolling is that i have to be the bad guy here , be it that way			0

the @entity29 bus gang rape was one of the most high - profile cases to hit @entity7 in recent years in a country where rape offences are reported every 21 minutes on average			1
