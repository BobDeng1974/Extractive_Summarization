' i 've seen all sorts of weather , but i 've never seen the data for two tornadoes at the same time like this			0
' according to @entity77 , the twin tornado phenomena like experienced in @entity6 occurs ' every 10 to 20 years			1
' a video released on thursday also captured the carnage from space , this time thanks to a satellite belonging to @entity93			0
the @entity95 satellite took images of the cloud formations over @entity7 and the eastern portion of the @entity99 , showing how massive the storm systems became before breaking up into different pieces			2
the video covered from june 16 until june 23 , starting with the @entity6 tornadoes and ending with storm systems that caused flooding in areas located off of the @entity106			1
