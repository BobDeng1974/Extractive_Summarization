by @entity0 published : 12:50 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 19:17 est , 14 october 2012 mystery : @entity4 murder victim @entity2 was pictured smiling just 33 minutes before he was gunned down the @entity7 family who died in a hail of bullets in the @entity10 was pictured ‘ smiling and relaxed ’ just 33 minutes before they were found dead			1
the time sequence was revealed six weeks after the @entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , were killed on september 5 close to @entity16 , in @entity17			0
@entity4 investigators have a picture taken by the family in the village of @entity22 , near to the murder site , at 3.15pm that day			1
@entity24 , the town ’s prosecutor , said it could be a vital insight into how and why they came to die on september 5			0
engineer @entity2 , 50 , his dentist wife @entity29 , 47 , and his 74 - year - old @entity32 mother - in - law , @entity31 , were all found dead in the family @entity34			1
all died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire which also killed 45 - year - old cyclist @entity37 , a @entity4 father - of - three who was hit by at least five bullets			1
the @entity42 ’s four - year - old daughter , @entity41 , survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother ’s corpse , while her sister , @entity46 , seven , was badly injured			1
mr @entity24 said that a few minutes before their car had pulled up outside a house in the nearby village of @entity22 , where they posed for the pictures			0
images retrieved in the @entity34 show ‘ a real family photograph ’ , said mr @entity24			1
‘ both women were smiling and did not seem worried			0
this suggests that everyone was relaxed at the time			0
’ but it is the timing of the pictures which is of particular interest to mr @entity24 and two investigating @entity4 judges working with @entity7 detectives			1
@entity64 , a 53 - year - old @entity65 who used to be in the @entity66 , was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle			1
he has described how he gave first aid to @entity46 , who had been shot in the shoulder and beaten savagely around the head			0
mr @entity64 said he also checked the pulse of mr @entity37 , turned off the @entity34 ’s engine , and carried out a number of other tasks before realising his mobile phone did not have a signal			1
he then cycled down the hill , away from the crime scene , and finally made a call to the emergency services logged at 15.48			0
scene : aerial photo of the car at the murder scene in the forrest near @entity88 and @entity16 in the @entity4 @entity4 this would have meant a window of far less than 33 minutes for the killer – or killers – to end the lives of four people , attack a child , and disappear without trace through one of the most popular tourist regions in eastern @entity17			2
detectives have been showing the photographs to villagers in the area but have refused to release them to the general public because , said one police officer , they are considered ‘ morbid ’			1
it follows criticism that they are making little progress in the investigation , after only opening a witness hotline last week , and interviewing a relatively small 650 people on an investigation spanning at least six countries			2
not a single suspect has been found in all that time , with sightings of potential killers few and far between			2
mr @entity24 today renewed his appeal for the driver of a green 4x4 vehicle seen speeding towards the scene by mr @entity64 to come forward , suggesting the car might have belonged to the national forestry office , the @entity121			0
but mr @entity122 added : ‘ it ’s a theory but there is no certainty			0
’ the prosecutor said that there was particular interest in a bank account in the nearby @entity131 city of @entity132 in mr @entity42 ’s name			0
believed to contain around three - quarters - of - a - million pounds , it is thought to be linked to a family will which mr @entity42 and his brother , @entity136 , were arguing about			2
as well as the family feud , mr @entity24 said the enquiry was concentrating on mr @entity42 ’s work on satellite systems , and his past life in @entity142 , where he was born .			2

@entity2 , his wife @entity29 and @entity32 mother - in - law @entity31 all found dead in family @entity34
four - year - old daughter @entity41 found alive , hiding under mother *'s* corpse
picture shown to villagers , but not released to general public as it is ' morbid '
no suspect found yet leading to criticism of @entity4 investigation
