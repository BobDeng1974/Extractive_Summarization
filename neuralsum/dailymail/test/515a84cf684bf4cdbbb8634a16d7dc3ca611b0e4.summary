ahead of golf 's first major of the year , where all talk is of whether @entity5 can complete a career grand slam or how @entity9 ' latest comeback will fare , @entity1 's @entity0 will bring daily updates from behind the scenes at @entity12			1
@entity13 1 @entity5 shields himself from the rain during a practice round at @entity12 vintage @entity16 ! you got ta love @entity18			1
even after all these years , the @entity20 could barely contain his excitement at driving down @entity22 for the masters			0
as he got out of the car , he realised he ’d left one rather important item back at his rental home			0
@entity20 @entity18 was so excited to get started at @entity12 that he forgot his clubs @entity32 flu - hit henrik fly ? there is a reason why the phrase ‘ beware the injured golfer ’ has entered the sport ’s lexicon			1
so who among the lame , sick and wounded currently playing down their chances is going to confound his own expectations this week ? listening to @entity44 @entity43 , who ’s just getting over a nasty bout of flu , he fits the bill			2
@entity43 of @entity44 looked less than impressed after coming down with a bout of flu look out for tiger cubs has @entity9 finally learned to look up and smell the azaleas ? not only will he play in the traditional par - three tournament for the first time in over a decade but sharing bag - carrying duties will be his two offspring , @entity56 and @entity57			1
do you think there might be one or two photographers who will take an interest ? @entity9 will be accompanied by his children when he plays the traditional three - par tournament the @entity64 masters tuesday saw the 80th anniversary of the most famous shot in the tournament ’s history , the one that put the event on the map , when @entity73 made his albatross on the 15th hole in the final round to edge out @entity77			1
@entity5 will impress us all if he completes his career @entity80 in more dramatic fashion than that			0
@entity73 played the most impressive shot in the tournaments history with an albatross on the 15th waiting for @entity86 a practice - round tradition at this grand old tournament is to gather around the beautiful par - three 16th hole and see which players are talented enough to skip their golf balls across the water and on to the green			2
so far , none has matched the amazing feats of @entity96 in 2009 and @entity97 in 2012 , whose shots not only reached the green but dropped into the hole			0
@entity97 of @entity101 is one of two players to have holed after skipping off the water at the 16th @entity104 , sir as the patrons make their way through the admission gates to @entity109 , the plethora of signs listing the prohibited items offers reassuring confirmation of the list of priorities at the masters			0
in order : no cellphones			0
