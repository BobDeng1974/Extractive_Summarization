her blue and grey upright @entity3 is still going strong and has never let her down even after vacuuming her carpets thousands of times over the years			2
mrs @entity1 , 77 , bought a new plastic cleaner ten years ago but used it just once and dumped it in a corner before returning to trusty @entity3			1
it was the first household item that great grandmother @entity12 and husband @entity13 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , bought when they were married in 1957			1
and apart from replacing the wire flex she has had to buy just one new bag , while the ancient motor continues to power the @entity3 on her twice weekly cleaning sessions			2

‘ we bought it from a local shop with back tax which was the income tax you got back if you were married before the end of the tax year			0
‘ i ca n't remember exactly how much we paid for it but there is not doubt we have had our moneysworth out of it and a lot more besides			0
‘ it 's had a few knocks over the years and the paintwork is scratched but it 's a metal body so it 's solid			0

‘ i have a son and a daughter , my daughter is a bit like me and will get her wear out of things but my son falls apart laughing because the cleaner is ancient and he thinks i ought to use the other one			0
’ @entity1 added : ‘ i hope i 've got a few years left yet but i bet my @entity3 will still be going when i 'm gone			2
