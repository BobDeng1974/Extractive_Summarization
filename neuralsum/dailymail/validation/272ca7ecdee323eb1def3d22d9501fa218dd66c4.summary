@entity0 had to be sent off by referee @entity1 for grabbing the official ’s shirt after being correctly cautioned for simulation			1
the @entity6 player will be awaiting the reaction from the @entity8 , who usually take a dim view of physical contact with officials			2
i hope there is not too strong a reaction as @entity0 ’s touch was light and born of frustration rather than aggression			0
@entity0 was sent off following two bookings after pushing @entity21 referee @entity1 the @entity6 playmaker puts his hands on referee @entity1 following his first yellow card for diving @entity0 walks off the @entity27 pitch following his red card as @entity6 were knocked out as @entity1 only gave a second yellow for the offence , the @entity8 are unlikely to punish @entity0 further			1
@entity0 had been booked earlier for a dive			0
@entity1 delivered a really impressive refereeing performance which belied his age ( 30 )			1
he was consistent , strong and impartial throughout			0
the first serious foul brought a very early yellow card for @entity36 though later @entity1 showed tolerance when @entity36 just clipped @entity38 , who demanded a second yellow card which was unsporting and unnecessary			0
@entity41 frontman @entity40 had his shirt pulled by @entity6 defender @entity43 there was a clear pull on @entity40 's shirt in the penalty area but @entity1 decided against giving a penalty			2

@entity0 was sent off after pulling at the shirt of @entity1
the 30 **-** year **-** old was correct to *dismiss* the @entity6 star
@entity1 gave an impressive performance and *stepped* up in a big game
