@entity1 ’s local hunt yesterday became the first to be convicted of illegally killing foxes			1
the @entity3 , which the prime minister has ridden with , was fined £ 4,000 after it admitted four offences under laws introduced in 2005			1
all previous prosecutions have been against named individuals			0
and yesterday @entity12 huntsman @entity11 and recently retired master @entity13 pleaded guilty to the same four charges			1
member @entity11 , is pictured left today , and right , @entity13 cruelty : the footage which was shown in court shows a fox being killed by hounds during a hunt however , a judge sitting at @entity27 ’ @entity25 questioned whether the ‘ staggering ’ £ 330,000 the @entity28 spent on bringing the case was money well spent			1
outside court , @entity11 , 49 , said he had been unable to afford to fight the charges and accused the animal charity of ‘ playing politics ’ by targeting a hunt in mr @entity1 ’s @entity37 constituency			1
the prime minister , who has promised a free vote on hunting in the @entity40 , rode with the @entity12 six times before the law changed			2
the hunt is popular with his fellow members of the @entity45 – an influential group of @entity47 and media professionals who live close to the @entity51 market town			1
the @entity3 's @entity52 , right , and @entity13 , left , who were fined today after pleading guilty to intentionally hunting a fox with dogs @entity56 , the husband of @entity58 chief executive @entity57 , is a member , and @entity60 presenter @entity59 has allowed it to ride on his land			1
more than 230 people have been convicted of illegal fox hunting since it was outlawed by @entity66 almost eight years ago			2
the majority of hunts continue to meet by using trail hunting , usually with a hunt member dragging the scent of fox urine across fields and woodlands			1
other hunts use an exemption that allows dogs to flush out quarry from woodland which can then be shot			0
yesterday was the first time the @entity28 had enough evidence to bring a prosecution against an entire hunt , rather than just individuals			1
graphic footage of foxes being attacked , which was taken by anti-hunt group @entity87 , was played to the court during yesterday ’s hearing			2
describing a hunt in february , prosecutor @entity90 , @entity91 , said : ‘ the hounds converge in to semi-circles and the screaming reaches a crescendo			2
the hounds are making a kill			0
’ the next clip showed the bloodied carcass of a fox clamped in the jaws of a hound , prompting gasps from a packed public gallery			2
passing sentence , district judge @entity106 said : ‘ hunting of foxes provokes extremely strong feelings on both sides of the argument ... some people see the hunting of foxes as cruel and immoral , others see it as an essential tradition , part of countryside management , and say criminalising the activity is inappropriate			2
‘ the coalition government has indicated the possibility of a free vote in @entity125 at some point in the future			0
‘ i must put all of these matters to one side			0
i must sentence fairly and in accordance with the law			0
’ the footage , pictured , showed evidence of ' prolonged and deliberate unlawful hunting , ' said mr @entity90 referring to the @entity28 costs for mounting the prosecution , he said : ‘ it is not for me to express an opinion , i merely flag it up , but i do find it to be a quite staggering figure			1
’ he said the costs for all five defendants were only £ 35,000			0
he fined 68 - year - old @entity13 £ 1,800 and @entity52 £ 1,000 for the offences which occurred on november 23 and november 30 , 2011 , and february 29 and march 7 this year			0
the hunt was told to pay £ 15,000 towards the @entity28 ’s costs , @entity13 £ 2,500 and @entity52 £ 2,000			1
outside court , @entity11 said : ‘ we conceded because the money was n’t there to defend ourselves			2
‘ i would like to stand there and defend it but there was no way it was possible			0
the fact a charitable body can take on this political thing and spend so much money which other people have given them for another thing , is stunning			0
‘ i just hope their donors question what they are doing with their money			0
they could have picked on any other hunt but they picked on @entity12 because we are in @entity1 ’s constituency			1
‘ they are trying to put pressure on him not to give a free vote like he said he would , to embarrass him in some way			0
’ @entity1 , left , and @entity56 , right , have ridden with the @entity175 previously speaking after the hearing , @entity28 chief inspector @entity176 said : ‘ the evidence in this case was incontrovertible – it clearly showed hounds being encouraged to pursue a fox			1
‘ this is illegal under the @entity183 and constitutes a wildlife crime			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity28 denied the charity had targeted @entity12 and said it would prosecute illegal behaviour wherever it found it			2
in their 2010 manifesto , the @entity188 promised a free vote in the @entity191 on whether to overturn the ban , but many doubt it will happen because @entity194 are opposed to the proposal			0
a growing number of younger female @entity197 , nicknamed the ‘ @entity200 ’ , are also said to be against any plans to lift the ban			0
