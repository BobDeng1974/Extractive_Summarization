by @entity1 reporter published : 00:54 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 5 march 2013 winter mornings spent shivering and scraping the ice from your windscreen could soon go out of the window			1
scientists have developed a coating for glass which keeps it clear – no matter what @entity12 throws at it			1
created by researchers from the @entity16 , it repels rain but absorbs moisture from the environment rather than allowing it to gather as condensation			2
the new coating ( right ) remained frost free and outperformed current anti-frost coatings ( left ) and untreated glass ( middle ) the coating is a ' zwitter - wettable surface ' which absorbs molecular moisture from the environment but repels rain			1
this means that , in effect , rain will bounce off the surface but dampness in the air will be absorbed rather than allowed to gather as condensation on the surface			2
engineers @entity45 and @entity47 of the @entity16 said : ‘ it resists both fogging and frosting which could have uses ranging from automobile windshields to camera lenses			1
’ its application could also work for spectacles or any kind of glass that is susceptible to getting steamed up in certain conditions , they said			1
currently the best water - repellent coatings are good for maintaining visibility through the windscreen in the driving rain			1
but they do not prevent the glass from getting misty because of the condensation that builds up in wet weather , the researchers said			2
however , the latest version developed is called a ' zwitter - wettable surface ' which absorbs molecular moisture from the environment but repels rain			1
this means that , in effect , rain will bounce off the surface but dampness in the air will be absorbed rather than allowed to gather as condensation on the surface			2
@entity81 , @entity45 said , is a @entity83 word for hybrid , used in a number of chemistry terms to describe something that carries two opposite properties at once			2
@entity90 start : scientists in the @entity92 say they have developed a coating for windscreens that will keep it clear no matter what the conditions in this case , it describes a surface that has the ability to behave as both hydrophobic ( to water droplets ) and hydrophilic ( to gas - phase water molecules )			1
the surface is made by a process called layer - by - layer deposition			0
in this case , alternating layers of two different polymers — poly ( vinyl alcohol ) and poly ( acrylic acid ) — are deposited on a glass surface			0
' the magic of what we do is nanoscale processing , ' @entity45 explains : producing the layers so as to control their properties almost down to the level of individual molecules			0
this production process appears relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out on large scales			0
' these are common polymers , ' @entity45 says			0
' they ’re well - known and cheap , but brought together in a unique way			0
' to test the effectiveness of this material , and that of many other alternatives , the team devised a set of extreme tests			0
for example , they kept samples of the material at minus 20 degrees @entity140 for an hour , then exposed them to a very humid environment			0
development : scraping frost from your car windscreen on cold mornings may become a thing of the past while untreated glass , or glass treated with conventional hydrophilic or hydrophobic coatings , quickly develop a layer of frost following such treatment , glass with the new treatment remains clear			1
however , it still appears to be hydrophobic in the presence of large water droplets			0
they believe it could be used in everything from the inside of car windshields and ski goggles to the inside of supermarket refrigerator cases and double glazing			0
@entity169 , a professor of polymer science at @entity171 who was not involved in this work , says , ' everyone knows how inconvenient , or even dangerous , it is to have a cold window or lens fog up when water condenses on it			1
' the @entity16 group has devised a practical and effective method of combatting the fogging problem using a new ultrathin polymer film			0

scientists in the @entity92 have developed a coating to keep windscreens clear
mornings spent scraping frost from windscreen could be thing of the past
coating could also work for spectacles and camera lenses , it is *claimed*
