by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 22:07 est , 14 june 2013 the police are ' frantically ringing around ' victims of abuse at the hands of @entity6 in a bid to reassure them their identities will not be revealed by @entity10 detective now going on @entity11 , a source has said			1
detectives from @entity10 were today contacting anyone who were interviewed by ex-detective constable @entity14 , who entered the show last night			1
the former policeman tried to avoid discussing his law enforcement career during his first night in the house , describing himself as ' unemployed ' and telling host @entity19 he was looking for a ' change ' in his life '			2
' i 'd done ten and a half years in the police and i 've worked really hard and achieved a lot , ' he said			0
' i just need a change			0
i wanted to explore the creative side of my personality			0
' @entity30 entrance : the former officer entering the @entity11 house on friday night yesterday lawyer @entity33 , head of the abuse department of @entity35 which represents 62 alleged victims of @entity38 's most prolific paedophile , said : ' this is extremely traumatic for some of the victims			1
fame game : former detective constable @entity14 , 33 , pictured , has caused controversy after quitting the @entity44 to pursue celebrity in reality show @entity11 ' they have poured their hearts out to this detective - some of them disclosing details which they have n't yet told their family			1
' now they fear that him appearing on @entity11 will mean that some highly confidential information will be revealed			2
' it 's not just the fear of what might come out on nation television , it 's also the fear of what this detective might be telling other housemates when the cameras are not on him which is giving them such torment			0
' we know the format of this show involves giving contestants copious amounts of alcohol , we just do n't know what information he might divulge during the programme			0
' she added : ' @entity77 have been incredibly irresponsible adding this former detective to the @entity11 house			1
' they must have known it was likely to cause distress for victims			0
but i can only imagine they thought his appearance would be good for the show 's publicity			0
' why else would he have been selected for the show if not to talk about all the salacious details of the @entity94 investigation ? ' when the victims gave their statements to police , they hoped for closure to an extremely distressing period of their lives			2
seeing mr @entity14 on @entity11 has reopened this wound			1
we hoped @entity10 would give victims the confidence to come forward , but this publicity stunt risks undermining that work			2
' bosses at @entity109 are said to be at furious former detective constable 's decision to seek celebrity status on the back of @entity38 's biggest sexual abuse investigation			2
concerns : a @entity109 child abuse detective who worked on @entity10 will enter the big brother @entity117 , probably on friday they have raised concerns his appearance on the show could compromise @entity10			1
and to highlight the level of concern felt among top brass at @entity109 , detectives are currently calling every alleged victim who has had contact with mr @entity14 to offer reassurance			1
a @entity131 spokesman said : ' victims remain our priority			2
' we are endeavouring to make contact with individuals who may have had face to face contact with the officer			0
' @entity77 refused to be drawn on criticism levelled at the programme			2
a spokesman said : ' @entity77 takes its obligations as a broadcaster seriously and , as has been made clear to @entity109 , extensive procedures are in place to ensure that nothing will be broadcast during the course of @entity11 which would involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality , invading the privacy of others , committing libel or a contempt of court			2
' revealed : the officer will be inside the new @entity11 house ( pictured ) , which has been unveiled as producers gear up for this summer 's new series until recently , the gay father - of - one , 33 , had been hunting celebrities who may also have carried out sex attacks , either with the help of paedophile @entity6 or working alone			1
but he is expected to be one of the show 's most controversial contestants when he enters the house tonight			0
' i think there will be some concern within the force ' , he told the @entity170			0
mr @entity14 , from @entity171 , @entity172 , said that he did not want to jeopardise a case he had worked on during the past eight months , adding : ' i ca n't talk about the content of the investigation but there may be a few concerned faces within my old department			1
' paedophile : @entity10 was launched after @entity6 's decades of sexual abuse were uncovered , which the officer reportedly told bb producers was ' upsetting ' and ' draining ' a @entity131 spokesman said : ' we are aware of reports concerning the proposed media appearance of a former detective constable			1
' we 've been in contact with @entity77 and made them fully aware of potential risks and their responsibility to live investigations			1
' all officers joining and leaving the @entity131 are required to sign the @entity195			2
' it is unclear if the former detective applied to be a contestant on the reality tv show while working for the @entity131			2
but it is understood mr @entity14 quit his job last month and auditions for the reality show opened in january			1
arrested stars include @entity205 , @entity206 , dj @entity207 , @entity208 , and @entity209			0
they all deny the allegations			0
@entity11 2013 launches tonight on @entity77 with a ' secrets and lies ' theme , which includes a prison inside the house			1
his decision to become a reality star will shock @entity109 and producers have said the child abuse expert has told them how life working on @entity222 and its 400 lines of inquiry was ' upsetting ' and ' draining '			1
a show insider said the officer knows the confidential nature of his work but understands ' it is only natural ' that other contestants will try to get ' as much gossip as possible ' about the investigation			2
mr @entity14 also spoke about the hours he spent sifting through evidence linked to @entity6 's decades of sexual abuse			1
he also said he worked in a specialist team of 30 officers and was pleased they had been able to make a difference to victims			1
' the housemate knows they are going to hit the headlines over this			0
leaving the police force to go into the @entity11 house is a massive move , ' a show insider told the @entity248			1
' their former bosses are going to be shocked about their decision to join the show and naturally will be worried about what might be said inside the house			0
' this person has seen a lot of bad things while working on @entity10			0
they will know what can and ca n’t be said inside the house but it ’s only natural for their housemates to want to try to get as much gossip as possible			0
' @entity77 sought to allay fears something broadcast on @entity11 could compromise the on - going investigation			1
a spokesman said : ' extensive procedures are in place to ensure nothing will be broadcast with which would involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality , committing libel or a contempt of court			0
' new pictures released this week revealed the house the new set of contestants will live in for the duration of this year 's show			0
ready for action : the theme this year is @entity284 and the house is decked out with numerous secret rooms - including a prison not long now : this year will see @entity19 take over the main hosting duties to replace @entity289 , but will the police officer keep quiet about his work at the @entity131 not only have producers added an outdoor shower , no doubt in the hope to get some steamy viewing action , but they 've also included a snug treehouse in the garden			1
its addition is no doubt put in place in a bid to encourage housemates to get some privacy away from the main building			0
other features include an outside shower , a ' prison ' for any bad behaving contestants and an electricity generating bike in the bedroom			0
suspects : pr guru @entity313 , left , and comedian @entity205 , right , are among those arrested in the @entity44 arrests : comedian @entity316 and @entity317 entertainer @entity206 have also been held by @entity318 sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
