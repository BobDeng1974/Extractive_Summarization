by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 read @entity2 on why one of the greatest players of his generation was never able to deliver for @entity6 @entity7 admitted retiring from @entity6 is one of the hardest decisions he has made but believes it will prolong his glittering @entity12 career			1
on what was a hugely emotional day for the 34 - year - old , @entity7 announced that " after much agonising " he would hand back the captain 's armband and end a 14 - year commitment to @entity6 that after his debut against @entity19 in may 2000 , yielded 114 caps and 21 goals			1
@entity37 - 90 @entity7 , who returned to training with @entity12 's squad here in @entity41 yesterday , will lead his club back into the @entity43 this september for the first time in five years and in order to be fit for the challenge , he accepted his workload needed to be managed			1
but that did not make the situation any easier and the realisation he will no longer play for @entity6 is something @entity7 will need time adjusting to , particularly as he is " still grieving " after he was left demoralised by the way @entity6 's @entity55 dreams unravelled in @entity56			1
' it was a very difficult decision , something i have been contemplating for a long time - not just since the @entity57 , ' said @entity7			0
' it 's a decision i 've taken very seriously and it has been tough			0
it has swung both ways at times and i 've had to take an awful lot of advice			0
' i have n't made my decision on the back of ( what happened at ) the @entity55			1
i 've made my decision on my age , on my body , on being fair to @entity12 , being respectful to them especially with the @entity43 back - that was a huge factor			1
' to ask my body now , the way it is and what it has been through , to play international football and domestic football was too much of an ask			0
but it is strange in a way because i still feel as though i could play for @entity6 in september , october , november , i 'm still in great physical decision			2
' but over the next two , three , four years , the best thing for my body , where i stand now , is to step aside out of the international fold and give my body the best chance to perform well , certainly over the next year while i 'm contracted to @entity12			2
the cap fits : @entity7 played his first international in 2000 under @entity89 , against @entity19 delight : ' i have enjoyed every minute of representing my country , ' said the former @entity6 skipper back then : @entity7 made his @entity6 debut alongside the likes of @entity95 14 years ago @entity97 @entity12 legends salute @entity7 @entity99 statement : @entity7 took to @entity100 to announce his retirement who should be @entity6 's next captain ? ' it 's certainly one of the toughest i 've had to make since i turned professional at 18 but i have come to the decision and i feel as if i have made the right decision			1
i would like to thank everyone who has been part of my international career			0
' @entity7 , who insisted he would always be there to continue his " strong relationship " with the @entity112 hinting , added in an interview on @entity114 : ' i was asked questions during the @entity55 , before the @entity55 , after the @entity55 to make a decision on my future , but it was n't the right time			2
' it was important that i came away from football , i had some time to be alone , be with my close family and friends and discuss and what was going to be the best decision for me moving forward			0
' the first time i spoke to @entity127 properly was this week , i tried to have an initial chat with him straight after the @entity55 , but i was too emotional to talk to him			1
i 'm still very upset with how the @entity55 went and i needed time to come away , gather my thoughts , clear my head and make sure it was the right decision because it was so big			2
' @entity127 made @entity6 captain before @entity133 , having previously worked with him at @entity12 , and he the head coach sent him into international retirement with a suitably glowing tribute			1
captain : @entity7 leads the way for @entity12 during training at @entity139 on monday lean on : @entity7 uses midfield partner @entity140 for support during @entity12 's training session knees - up : the @entity12 captain has said he is focusing on their upcoming @entity43 campaign ton up : the @entity6 captain won his 100th cap in 2012 , when @entity6 met @entity148 in a friendly ' he is an incredible man and a fantastic footballer who we have all been blessed to see in an @entity6 shirt so often , ' said @entity127			1
' it is never by coincidence that people reach such a staggering figure as 114 caps , it is a mark of his wonderful talent allied to a huge drive and determination to live up to the highest standard			2
' there is little doubt he will leave a gaping hole in @entity6 's midfield and @entity140 , who has thrived for @entity12 and established himself as international regular under @entity7 's wing , put the challenge @entity127 faces of trying to find a player and leader into context when he described @entity7 as being " irreplaceable "			1
' @entity172 is one of the best players this country has ever seen and one of the best leaders so he is a big loss for @entity6 , ' said @entity140			2
' but at the same time it is a big plus for @entity12 , he will be fresher , have more in his legs especially with @entity43			1
celebration : @entity7 returned to his primary school when he won his 100th cap to celebrate with the pupils passion : being made @entity6 captain made @entity7 the proudest man in the country , he claimed iconic : a young @entity7 scored a stunning goal in @entity6 's 5 - 1 victory over @entity190 in 2001 heartache : the midfielder was one of @entity194 's penalty villains as they crashed out of the 2006 @entity55 good times : @entity7 's 21 goals for his country put him 20th on the list of @entity6 all - time top goalscorers ' that ’s the way he will be looking at it , he will be ready to play all the games this season for @entity12 and that ’s a plus for him and @entity12			1
how much did the @entity55 hurt him ? he was absolutely devastated , just like everyone else to be fair			0
his leadership skills are fantastic and everyone was disappointed and no more so than him			0
' i was n’t sure ( whether he would step down ) as he loves football and you can see that every time he puts on the @entity6 shirt			0
i knew it would be a big decision for him and he did the right thing going away and spending time with his family to think about it			0
everyone just has to respect his decision			0
' @entity12 , meanwhile , will officially make their sixth and seventh signings of the summer in the next 24 hours ; both @entity221 , the @entity223 striker , and @entity224 , the @entity225 international , have flown to @entity41 to complete medicals			0
@entity221 has agreed personal terms after @entity12 's # 8.5million bid was accepted by @entity229 , while @entity230 will cost around # 10million			2
he , however , will return to @entity231 to spend next season at his old club on loan to gain experience			0
debate : his career was constantly dogged by the question of whether he could play with @entity34 sad end : the @entity241 in @entity56 could have been a glorious ending - but it ended in humiliation			0

@entity6 captain earned 114 @entity6 caps since his debut in 2000
@entity12 midfielder captained @entity127 's team in 2014 @entity55
@entity6 captaincy ' made me the proudest man in the country '
gives up @entity6 to ensure @entity12 can stay in @entity43
