protecting the @entity1 prize money is the biggest reason the @entity1 is prepared to give away what amounts to almost title sponsorship of the tournament to @entity6			1
the proposed £ 30million , three - year contract for an @entity8 , revealed by @entity9 , gives the @entity1 the resources to ensure the monies received by the clubs for progressing in the world ’s most famous club knockout tournament			1
the figures range from £ 1,150 for winning the extra preliminary round through to the £ 1.8million either @entity17 or @entity18 — on a par with the @entity20 singles champions — will receive for lifting the trophy on may 30			1
@entity17 will face the holders @entity18 in this season 's final at @entity26 should @entity18 repeat their 2014 @entity1 triumph , they stand to pocket £ 1.8million in prize money the numbers will not register for @entity31 clubs awash with tv money but £ 18,000 for winning a first - round @entity1 match would make a lot of difference to a non-league club			1
and the @entity1 fund — like the @entity38 and @entity40 budget — was very likely to be raided before the @entity6 deal to fund the £ 30m - a - year priorities of @entity1 chairman @entity43 ’s @entity42 which centre on coaches and facilities that have seen all @entity1 departments asked to make 15 per cent cuts			1
@entity1 chairman @entity43 ’s @entity42 is focusing on coaches and facilities @entity51 , the original technical director in the @entity31 , was one of the delegates at the first sporting directors summit — co-founders include @entity56 ’s son @entity55 — held at the @entity57 in @entity58 on wednesday			2
and @entity51 , who worked in the role at @entity60 and @entity61 , believes the position is now an integral part of a modern football club provided the owner agrees			0
while at @entity61 , @entity51 tried to sign three @entity67 youngsters resulting in chairman @entity68 making an official complaint about an illegal approach			0
@entity61 paid £ 5m in compensation			2
ironically , one of that trio , @entity73 , who decided to stay at @entity74 at the time , is now in the @entity42 squad			0
@entity51 said : ‘ i ’m delighted for @entity73			0
he was a real talent from the start			0
’ @entity60 defender @entity73 ( right ) competes for possession with @entity81 's @entity80 @entity83 staff have no doubts the £ 4.2billion spend on @entity31 rights is responsible for the latest huge cost - cutting exercise — an ‘ @entity90 ’ strategy delivered to 600 production services personnel this week that is expected to result in at least 70 redundancies			1
operations director @entity91 , now nicknamed @entity92 for the way he delivered news of job losses dressed up as changes in working patterns , was heckled for refusing to take questions			0
@entity83 say this planning started long before the @entity31 tender			2
meanwhile , those heading for @entity83 ’s exit door after the consultation exercise will be delighted to know mediocre £ 4m - a - year pundit @entity103 paid for his private jet flight to the @entity107 v @entity106 match out of his own pocket			1
@entity83 pundit @entity103 ( centre ) paid for his own private jet to the recent @entity107 vs @entity106 derby the fallout from the @entity8 deal included former minister for sport @entity115 labelling the deal ‘ commercialism gone mad ’			1
this is the same out – of - touch @entity115 who failed in a bid to become @entity1 chairman and is still disliked by @entity1 councillors after telling blazers they were ‘ not fit for purpose ’			1
however , even @entity1 diehards including the traditionalist who told broadcasters there would never be a 5.30pm cup final kick - off while he had ‘ a hole in his a * * * ’ , accept sponsorships are critical for @entity1 finances			1
former minister for sport @entity115 has branded the @entity1 @entity6 deal ‘ commercialism gone mad ’ @entity136 top job @entity138 hardly merits a mention for the @entity42 director of cricket role for which former captain @entity141 is front - runner			2
but @entity138 is the most qualified after stints as an @entity42 coach and director of cricket for @entity148 , while he is also halfway through the part - time two - year masters of @entity151 degree at @entity152			0
also part of the audience at the directors ’ summit was former @entity42 team director @entity157 , who is now happy to stay in the background running the cricket academy at @entity160			2
@entity161 , 23 - year - old @entity162 chairman and grandson of @entity164 , loves to socialise with the team , especially manager @entity166			0
but the pair ’s celebration night out in @entity58 bar @entity172 after @entity166 ’s first win as boss against @entity169 on april 18 was somewhat premature			0
a week later they lost at home to @entity176 and on tuesday were relegated to @entity177 .			0

the proposed £ 30million gives the @entity1 the resources to ensure the monies received by the clubs for progressing in the tournament
figures range from £ 1,150 for winning an extra preliminary round game to £ 1.8million for being crowned champions
@entity83 's @entity90 ’ strategy is set to result in 70 redundancies
