@entity0 may sympathise with @entity2 's pressurised position at @entity3 but the @entity5 manager still hopes to use it to his advantage when the sides meet on saturday			1
the timing of @entity0 's arrival at @entity11 could not be more awkward for all concerned , with the boyhood @entity3 fan touted as a possible replacement for @entity2 should the axe fall			1
significant fan protests are expected and @entity2 himself has predicted ' mass hysteria '			2
@entity5 boss @entity0 knows his side must capitalise on the turmoil at @entity3 on saturday @entity0 experienced similar times at neighbouring @entity22 and would not wish them on a fellow boss but admits he is hoping to take a ' mercenary ' advantage of the situation			1
' i know what he 's going through after being in the @entity28 and it 's not easy			2
it 's not an easy place to manage , ' he said			0
' you genuinely feel for the manager in charge and at this moment ( @entity2 is ) under the hammer , after only four games			1
a section of @entity3 supporters make their feelings know , printing thousands of ' sack @entity2 ' posters @entity3 fans are becoming increasingly frustrated with @entity2 's tenure , displaying several banners ' we all understand it 's a results based business but some of the nonsense that goes with it , i have to say is ridiculous			1
' unfortunately with the way social media is and the way the media is there is a huge appetite for what we call nonsense			0
it comes with the territory but you have to say in the @entity28 it seems to quadruple : when there 's a crisis , there 's a crisis , and i suppose that comes from the huge support they have got			0
' it 's a difficult , difficult place to manage			0
but we have to try and take advantage of that , of course we do			0
we have to be mercenary enough to try and do that			0
' the other stuff is not enjoyable to watch from afar			0
over the years he 's done a decent job has @entity2 but i think that 's the nature of the beast , especially in the @entity28 , and i can say that because i 'm from there			2
' @entity0 , instructing @entity3 loanee @entity82 , sympathises with @entity2 's deteriorating situation			1
