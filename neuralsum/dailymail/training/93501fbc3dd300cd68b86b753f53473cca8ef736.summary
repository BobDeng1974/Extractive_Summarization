by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 16 may 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 16 may 2013 it is the most dangerous peacetime job a man can do			1
and for the wives , mothers and daughters who lose their loved ones to the sea rather than to war the burden is no less to bear			1
now , modelling themselves on the success of the @entity14 , a group of women bound together by heartbreaking loss are finding support in each other , and singing			1
the newly formed @entity19 have recruited almost 40 members from fishing communities all across the @entity22			1
each has lost a relative to the sea and this week , with the help of the man behind the @entity14 , they recorded their first charity single			1
as a young widow mrs @entity37 was confronted with the grief of losing her husband but also the struggle of providing for her children as a single mum			1
she admits she was left ‘ penniless ’ and without the charity the @entity48 providing her with both financial and emotional support , says she ‘ would n’t have survived			1
’ now her idea to bring together women with similar experiences has come to life and their single , a unique arrangement of the @entity58 ’s hymn ‘ @entity59 ’ , is set to be released in july			2
but mrs @entity37 , who works for a children ’s charity in her home town of @entity63 - on - sea , never intended to launch a choir			1
she wanted to try and raise some money for the charity , suggesting to a few friends via @entity69 that they do a karaoke style song to sell in the local pub. but almost overnight , she says ‘ things snowballed ’ and she found herself being contacted by women from all over the country asking if they could join in too			2
the choir was the brain - child of mum - of - four @entity37 , 47 , whose trawler - man husband @entity38 was drowned in a freak storm off the coast of @entity41 in 2008 , and now they 're releasing their debut charity single she said : ‘ it ’s so amazing to have had this little idea over a year ago and see it finally all coming together			1
‘ most of us have has never even met each other other face - to - face before this week , let alone sing together but we ’re all here for the same reason , to pay tribute to men we loved			2
‘ @entity38 made me a better person because he was someone that always did the right thing so i know he would be pleased that now i am doing the right thing for the @entity48			0
‘ @entity96 supported the children and i from the first few hours after @entity38 went missing , i just ca n’t say enough good things about them			0
’ mrs @entity37 has also got huge support from another all female choir and even recruited their music producer @entity101 to help too			1
she added : ‘ the support we have had from the @entity14 has been fantastic - we all of us have the same fear that when our men go to work we do n’t know if we ’re going to see them again			1
‘ living with that uncertainty hanging over you everyday bring us together and we all feel a strong and common bond			0
‘ very often @entity38 went to work and he did n’t earn enough to cover the cost of diesel he put in the boat but it ’s not just a job it ’s in their blood			0
music producer @entity101 , who produced the @entity14 ' number one album , has donated his time to help the @entity122 and says he believes they have every chance of achieving the same level of success ‘ he had 400 years of fishermen in his family , he used to joke that he had salt water in his veins			1
‘ we want to use music to remind people yes we should be proud of our military and yes we should also be proud of our fishermen			0
’ music producer @entity101 , who produced the @entity14 ’ number one album , has donated his time to help the @entity122 and says he believes they have every chance of achieving the same level of success			1
he said : ‘ the @entity14 became so successful that we set standard in pop music for choirs with the number one single and album			1
‘ they captured people ’s hearts and i think this can be another one of those true life stories that really strike a chord with people			0
‘ it ’s a very personal project for me , i ’ve known @entity37 for years and i remember receiving the e-mail she sent us all in 2008 saying that her husband had gone out fishing and had n’t come back			1
‘ this is a very similar thing to what we did with the @entity14 , a lot of them had n’t sung together before but it means they ’re a completely blank canvas and i find that really exciting			1
’ @entity159 , 57 , was one of the first members of the choir , as soon as she saw the @entity69 advert she knew she had to be a part of it			2
she lost her husband @entity151 12 years ago when he disappeared while out fishing on the rocks near their home in , @entity167 , @entity168			1
she said : ‘ on the day he died it was too rough for them to go out on the boat but he decided to go out angling off the rocks instead			0
‘ at tea time that day i had a knock on the door from the police saying they had found his fishing gear on the rocks and that he was missing			2
’ @entity151 ’s body was found nine days later by one of his colleagues			0
he had a fractured skull leading officials to believe that he slipped on the rocks before being washed out to sea			2
mrs @entity159 said she joined the @entity122 with her daughter @entity185 , 29 , to pay tribute to @entity151			0
their single , a unique arrangement of the @entity58 's hymn @entity59 , is set to be released in july and they starred on @entity190 this week she added : ‘ i wanted to do this in memory of @entity151 , he was a fisherman from the time he left school , the job meant the whole world to him			2

’ @entity203 , 29 , is one of the youngest members of the choir			2
she was five when her father @entity206 , then 43 , was pulled over board with the nets while fishing in the @entity209			2
as a professional musician @entity210 , from @entity211 , @entity212 , jumped at the chance to join the @entity122 and volunteered as one of the three solo vocalists			0
she said : ‘ the thing that is special about this choir is that we all share part of a very special identity			0
‘ fishing is always told from a male point of view but that is why this choir is so amazing , it tells the stories of the communities through women ’s eyes			1
@entity230 from the @entity48 said it was ' incredibly rewarding ' to watch the choir rehearse and called them ' an inspiration ' ‘ most of us have really only just met but we feel like we know each other already , fishing is something that is in your blood , i ca n’t describe it			0
’ @entity230 from the @entity48 said it was ‘ incredibly rewarding ’ to watch the choir rehearse and called them ‘ an inspiration			0
’ he said : ‘ we are a charity and we have people doing all kinds of things to raise money for us but this is really tremendous			0
‘ a whole group of fishwives coming together to sing for us is such an inspiration			0
‘ it helps raise our profile and raise our funds but it also gives us a feeling that we made a difference in supporting these families when they needed it , it makes it all incredibly rewarding			0
‘ it ’s a beautiful way of saying thank you			0
