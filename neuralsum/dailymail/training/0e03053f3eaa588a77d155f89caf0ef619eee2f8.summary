by @entity0 a little boy with an extreme allergy to all food survives on a diet of just boiled sweets			1
@entity6 suffers from a rare eating disorder which means he is unable to eat normal food without having an extreme allergic reaction			1
the three - year - old 's body fights food as if it were a virus , causing him to bleed internally			1
sweet tooth : @entity6 suffers an extreme allergy to all food and the only thing his body can tolerate is a diet of boiled sweets he has undergone a series of genetic tests at @entity21 in @entity22 in a bid to identify what is causing his rare form of eosinophilic enterocolitis			1
now @entity6 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , has adapted to living on a diet of eating 10 @entity32 's @entity31 sweets every day			1
his mother , @entity34 , 27 , has even taken to melting down the boiled sweets into ' ice lollies ' to make them more appetising for her little boy			1
despite his heartbreaking condition , she says @entity6 is always smiling and , surprisingly , his favourite places to go to are pubs and @entity42 's chicken restaurants			1
brave : @entity6 with his mother , @entity34			2
she says despite his condition , her son is always smiling - even when his @entity47 dinner was a cup of ice eosinophilic enteropathy is a complicated digestive system disorder in which eosinophils , a type of white blood cell , are found in above - normal amounts in one or more specific places in the digestive system and / or the blood			2
eosinophilic enteritis affects the small intestine in particular			0
when the body wants to attack a substance , such as an allergy - triggering food or airborne allergen , eosinophils respond by moving into the area and releasing a variety of toxins			2
however , when the body produces too many eosinophils , they can cause chronic inflammation , resulting in tissue damage			0
common symptoms may include pain , swelling , skin rash , hives , reflux , choking , difficulty swallowing , nausea , vomitting , loss of appetite , stools containing blood and / or mucus and abdominal cramping			0
many people also experience nutritional deficiencies and / or side effects from medications , such as neuropathy ( nerve damage ) or osteoporosis ( decrease in bone mass )			0
but instead of gorging on chicken , he sits with a cup of crushed ice while watching his parents eat			0
and a @entity100 from @entity101 for @entity6 means he can only enjoy the toy			2
@entity6 , who has to be fed six times per day through his tube , has already undergone 10 operations during his young life to replace or re-locate his feeding tube as well as exploratory procedures			1
@entity34 only discovered her son was able to eat the @entity110 after a tip from another mother at a support group			0
up until then , she had tried hundreds of different foods in the desperate search for something @entity6 might be able to eat without getting seriously ill. it is currently a mystery why his body is able to tolerate the sweets but no other foods			1
@entity34 , 27 , has been amazed by her son 's positive nature despite the hardships he has faced since he was born			0
the qualified nursery nurse said : ' @entity6 can not eat anything other than boiled sweets			1
' we realised they were the one thing he could eat that he did not have a reaction to and he gets through 10 of them every day			1
' i have even melted them down and made them into lollies for him , so he 's got something a bit different to eat			2
' his older sister , @entity142 , five , also has the same illness which causes a serious allergic reaction to dairy , eggs and soya			0
battle : @entity6 has to be fed through a tube several times a day and has has already undergone 10 operations involving his feeding tube , plus other exploratory procedures but while she is able to eat other foods , @entity6 's case is so rare , he can not eat anything			1
instead , he gets his nutrients by having a highly nutritional liquid food formula placed into his stomach through a specialist feeding tube every two - and - a - half hours			0
curious : it is currently a mystery why @entity6 's body is able to tolerate the sweets but no other foods @entity34 , who is now a full time carer to her son , added : ' i am of course biased but he is amazing - he still loved @entity47 even though his three - course dinner was just crushed ice , a water lolly and some of his favourite sweets			1
' he has to undergo weekly blood tests and he never gets down			0
' because i ca n't treat him to food it does end up costing me a fortune in other treats - if he sees a magazine he 'll end up being bought it - he 's totally spoiled			0
' despite his food allergy , he still loves going out and he says his favourite place is the pub. ' he 'll sit there with a cup of ice and be quite happy - he 's such an inspiration			0
' @entity6 's friends and family have helped raise more than Â £ 10,000 for more research to be carried out			2
@entity34 , whose husband @entity192 , 31 , is a builder , added : ' there were n't any warning signs before we had the children			0
' a few members of our families have mild food allergies but nothing like what @entity6 has			2
' it can be tough at times for me because , as a mum , i blame myself , wondering if i was carrying a faulty gene but you just have to get on and deal with it , there is no point dwelling upon it			0
' if the research being done does not help @entity6 , hopefully it will make difference to another family who are going through what we have been through			0
' @entity34 has to always be on full - alert in case @entity6 's feeding tube breaks as she then only has 20 minutes to get him to hospital to put a replacement in before an operation is needed again to insert one .			1
