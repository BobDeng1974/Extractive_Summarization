stuff of nightmares : the piranha has preyed on our imaginations for decades the seven - year - old girl was just one of thousands in the water of the mighty @entity7 on the afternoon of @entity8 last week			1
for residents of the central @entity12 city of @entity13 , the festive season most certainly does not involve eating mince pies and drinking eggnog before sleeping it off in front of a fire			1
instead , with the mercury hitting a sticky 100 degrees , most are keener to cool off than to gorge themselves			1
the best place for a dip is the city ’s @entity23 , a mile - long stretch of sandy beach on @entity28 ’s second largest river			1
with bars , restaurants and fun fairs , the beach is a major attraction and last wednesday was no exception			1
tens of thousands had gathered to enjoy the holiday			2
many took the opportunity to swim or paddle in the river			2
that afternoon , as the little girl splashed up to her waist in the waters , everything seemed quite normal			2
then , she suddenly felt a tugging at the little finger of her left hand			2
instinctively , she pulled away , but the tugging grew more powerful			2
and then came a searing pain that caused her to cry out			2
she looked down at her finger , but all she could see was a trail of blood leaking into the dark @entity55 she ran for the shore , her screams startled the sunbathers			2
the top part of the girl ’s finger had been completely torn away			2
there could be no doubt what had happened			2
the girl had been attacked by one of man ’s most feared creatures — the deadly piranha fish			1
word quickly spread up and down the @entity23			1
lifeguards ordered people to stay out of the water but , tragically , the heat was so intense and the atmosphere so jubilant that people continued to swim			1
what happened next was like a scene from a horror film			2
that afternoon , some 70 people - around 20 of them children - were savaged by shoals of the razor - toothed fish			1
those who were attacked had chunks of their naked and exposed flesh ripped away			1
deep cuts were reported on scores of fingers , ankles and toes			2
one injury resulted in an amputation			2
pictures taken in the local hospital show one man with the whole underside of one toe missing			2
the attack was the most serious in the city since 2008 , when 40 swimmers were hurt and , while mercifully no one was killed , the story made headlines around the world			1
there is something about this sinister fish that preys on our imaginations			2
along with great white sharks , wolves , pythons and crocodiles , the piranha is the stuff of nightmares			0
ever since @entity128 ’s @entity127 adventure stories described game hunters and explorers being devoured after daring to swim in piranha - infested waters , we have been taught that the piranha is one of the deadliest predators on the planet			1
most of us can create a horrific mental image of falling into a river - and being stripped to the bone in two minutes by a boiling shoal of flesh - eating fish			1
just such a fate was memorably portrayed in the @entity144 film @entity143 , when the evil @entity145 dispatched @entity146 into a tank of piranhas for her failure to kill @entity144			0
although not as great a horror movie staple as the great white shark - immortalised in the @entity154 films - our fascination with the piranha has made for box office success			1
since 1978 , there have been at least six films starring the piranha			0
the most recent was last year ’s @entity162			0
no wonder @entity163 were alarmed when a piranha was discovered in the @entity165 in 2004			0
experts stressed that the fish had in all likelihood been thrown away by a collector of rare fish , and further reassured anxious @entity163 that the water of the @entity165 is far too cold to sustain these creatures			0
vicious : attacks by piranha fish are becoming more frequent yet despite their awesome power , scientists insist piranhas are not the malicious predators the films would have you believe			0
they tend to attack humans only if trapped or hungry			1
so who is to blame for our fear of this fish ? it is none other than @entity188 , the 26th president of the @entity189 in 1914 , he published a travel book through the @entity192 wilderness , in which he described how piranhas could eat entire animals , such as cattle , alive			0
‘ they are the most ferocious fish in the world , ’ @entity188 wrote			0
‘ the head with its short muzzle , staring malignant eyes , and gaping , cruelly armed jaws , is the embodiment of evil ferocity ; and the actions of the fish exactly match its looks			0
’ @entity188 ’s book was read by many , and the piranha entered into the public consciousness as one of mankind ’s most vicious foes			0
however , what @entity188 was not told was that the piranha attack he had witnessed on a cow was staged			1
for the benefit of the former president , the @entity192 had trapped hundreds of piranhas in a netted - off stretch of the river and had then starved them for days			1
this created the ideal conditions			0
when @entity188 arrived , a sick old cow was led into the water , with its udder slit to release blood to further encourage an attack			1
trapped , starving , and excited by blood , the piranhas did their job all too well			0
rumours of deadly @entity28 fish had been known since the time of the @entity235 , who reported they were often attacked when they forded rivers			1
in the 19th century , naturalist and explorer @entity237 insisted the piranha was one of the continent ’s greatest dangers			0
what sets them apart from other fish are their terrifying sharp teeth , tightly packed into highly muscular jaws			0
relative to its size - they grow up to ten inches long - a piranha has a more powerful bite than that of a @entity255			1
recently , scientists measured the bite force of the black piranha at 320 newtons , which is nearly three times greater than that exerted by an @entity28 alligator			0
that is more than enough to rip off a finger			0
what is disturbing is that these attacks are becoming more frequent			0
in november 2011 , 15 swimmers were bitten by piranhas in the @entity269 in western @entity192			0
powerful : when scientists measured the power of a piranha 's bite last year it was easily enough to sever a finger one , 22 - year - old @entity276 , recalled how he suddenly felt an agonising pain in his foot			1
‘ i saw that i had lost the tip of my toe , ’ he said			0
‘ i took off running out of the river , afraid that i would be further attacked because of the blood			1
i ’m not going back in for a long time			0
’ one local fisherman talked of catching some of the fish in his nets and often seeing blood on the banks			0
despite relying on the river for his livelihood , @entity288 said : ‘ i would never even think of going in there			0
’ in @entity293 the following month , a drunk 18 - year - old fisherman jumped out of his canoe , and was seized by a shoal of piranhas			1
although he managed to get out of the water , he bled to death			0
last year , a five - year - old @entity192 girl is said to have been attacked and killed in the water by a shoal of the fish			1
after the feeding frenzy in @entity12 last week , @entity303 , a local expert , said that the @entity8 attack was ‘ exceptional and unlikely to be repeated ’			1
‘ what happened has no logical explanation , ’ he told a local radio station			0
‘ in this area , the water flows too fast to create the warm and stagnant conditions where the fish are comfortable			0
’ while some observers claimed the piranha were attracted by debris left by fishermen , the only explanation mr @entity303 could suggest was that one of the fish had been injured - and the shoal had descended to eat it			1
some of the human bathers simply got in the way			1
certainly , cannibalism among piranhas is common , and larger , more aggressive fish will take a bite out of smaller rivals			0
the @entity8 attack alone would have been enough to terrify most of us			1
but there have been more since			0
on @entity337 , in the town of @entity335 , 600 miles up the @entity7 ( the name , although it sounds like that of the fish , actually translates as ‘ big as the sea ’ ) to the north - east , five children and teenagers were attacked by piranhas			1
all had to be treated in hospital			0
and then , on friday , back at the @entity23 in @entity13 , another attack took place			1
at four o’clock in the afternoon , a ten - year - old boy was bitten on his right hand , and he too had to be taken to hospital			2
the experts may like to reassure us that piranha attacks on humans are rare , but are they right ? perhaps the truth about the dreaded piranha may be closer to the horror movies after all .			0

bathers were attacked on the @entity23 beach in @entity12
among *revellers* cooling off in 100 - degree heat were 20 children , who were injured in the frenzied attack
