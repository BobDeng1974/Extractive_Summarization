by @entity0 @entity2 of @entity3 legend sir @entity1 spoke of their fury yesterday over his plans to strip thousands of trees from his @entity9 estate			1
the trees will be uprooted from the singer 's 600 - acre @entity11 near @entity13 in @entity14 and @entity15 as part of a forestry maintenance programme			2
@entity1 's management company is understood to have proposed to move 300 lorry loads of timber a year using a single track road			1
@entity22 say plans to remove 300 lorry - loads of timber a year from sir @entity1 's @entity9 farm down a single - track road are unsafe ( @entity1 pictured on the farm in 1970 with first wife @entity28 , left ) but nearby residents already endure heavy vehicles using surrounding roads to service a quarry , and have said adding more vehicles is dangerous to pedestrians and other drivers			1
@entity36 , of @entity37 , said : ' we are already at saturation point			0
this wood could easily be taken out another road on @entity1 's estate which joins the @entity43 at his @entity44			1
' my son and his partner have just built a house opposite me and they have a four - week - old daughter and there is no way you would want to push a pram on that road			1
' it is a dangerous , single - track road with blind corners , potholes and limited passing places			1
' @entity36 lives at the foot of a steep hill which is particularly difficult for both cars and lorries to climb			0
he said : ' i 'm not sure @entity1 is even aware of this proposal			2
i think if he knew , he would see sense , he 's a family man			0
sir @entity1 purchased the farm in 1966 and moved there with first wife @entity28 and his children in 1970 after @entity3 split up ' i 've met him lots of times and think he would listen			1
he 's always respected this area and his neighbours always protected his privacy when the media came sniffing around			0
' we have been very loyal to him			0
' sir @entity1 , 72 , shocked his fans around the world when he purchased the farm in 1966			1
he later moved there with his wife @entity28 and their children for peace and quiet after the band 's infamous break - up in 1970			1
his family used the farm to grow their own food and keep horses for riding around the local countryside			2
neighbours were known to frequently send reporters looking to find @entity11 on wild goose chases to places as remote as the @entity95			0
@entity1 said the beauty of the peaceful and rugged area saved him from a nervous breakdown caused by the pressures of his stardom			2
since @entity28 's death at the age of 56 from breast cancer in 1998 he began severing ties to the area , but there is a memorial garden in @entity13 named in her memory			2
@entity108 , who also lives close to the farm , said : ' i have three young children and i am concerned about road safety			2
' it is busy enough with quarry lorries			0
timber lorries would be too much			0
' mr @entity1 is perfectly entitled to take out his timber , i just hope he looks at this differently			1
' local councillor @entity118 said : ' there have already been concerns about the safety of those using @entity123			0
' it is also part of the @entity126 and well used by cyclists and walkers			0
' a spokesman for @entity1 's management team , @entity130 , said : ' plans for felling have been underway for some time in the interest of good forestry management			1
' no decision have been made on how the wood will exit the estate			0
all available options are being explored taking into account a whole range of factors including impact on residents			0

@entity1 bought farm in 1966 with first wife @entity28 and lived there in 70s
there are plans to remove 300 lorry - loads of timber per year from estate
@entity22 say *trucks* driving down single - track road will be dangerous
