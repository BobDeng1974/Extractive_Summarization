@entity0 is widely considered to be the most successful model agent in the world			2
the 64 - year - old founder of @entity4 managed some of the biggest supermodels of the nineties , including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
but despite the @entity11 providing some of the best talent of the era , @entity0 claims that the country is unlikely to be responsible for creating any more of the top names in the industry because we 're lazy and eat too much			2
at that time , the supermodels could command up to £ 300,000 for a job according to @entity4 co-founder @entity0 , who has now written a tell - all book about her experiences managing the most beautiful women in the world in the1990s she told @entity31 from @entity33 magazine : ' the @entity11 are s * * t. even if they 're from a poor background , @entity11 girls have everything			1
' they come from , say , @entity38 , and they do n't want to leave their mates or their boyfriend — they 're torn			0
' ( and ) we 're not as fit			0
maybe we eat too much			0
' the @entity42 is equally dismissive of the likes of @entity44 , who she classes as ' short ' , despite standing at 5ft 8ins tall			2
during the interview , @entity0 claims that @entity50 's half - sister can hardly be classed as a model and claims her attraction lies simply in her famous name , because she gives the big fashion houses exposure			2
@entity10 , @entity19 , @entity55 , and @entity9 at the chanel @entity58 ready - to - wear collection as head of @entity60 , @entity0 has spent the last few decades looking after the world 's most beautiful women , which is no easy feat. her role was far more than just booking her clients into great advertising campaigns of catwalk shows , the the company she ran with her brother was responsible for pandering to their every whim			1
in her new book , ' have i said too much ? my life in and out of the @entity74 , ' @entity0 reveals that she had to undergo a number of errands , including couriering sex toys to a suite at the @entity80 hotel in central @entity42 late one night and sourcing llama curry for another woman as she was boarding a private jet in @entity23			1
in another incident , @entity0 tells style magazine about having to fly in special green candles for one model from a remote area in @entity89			0
@entity4 co-founder @entity0 , 64 , at her @entity42 offices @entity92 chairman @entity91 with models @entity93 , @entity19 and @entity9 in 1994			1
according to @entity0 , big firms would do anything and pay anything to sign up one of the supermodels for their ad campaigns in the @entity101 @entity8 and @entity102 at an auction for @entity105 's @entity104 in @entity106 in 1998 in 1990 , one of @entity0 's clients @entity10 claimed about her gang of supermodels : ' we do n't wake up for less than $ 10,000 a day			1
' but @entity0 has now debunked that myth , revealing that the price for a supermodel to appear from underneath the duvet was sometimes 30 times that amount of money			0
in an advert for the new @entity120 in 1992 , @entity0 negotiated a deal for @entity20 , @entity10 and @entity8 that us eye - watering even by today 's standards - each woman was paid £ 300,000 for their part on the tv clip			1
but even for that amount of money , it was still a chore actually getting the girls out of bed			0
in an excerpt of her book shared with the magazine , @entity0 reveals that she used to pretend a photo - shoot was taking place two hours earlier than it was scheduled for as the models would always be at least that late getting out of bed			1
after a while , she had to make the start - time three hours early as the women and twigged that they were being tricked and used to lie in even later			0
the one exception to this rule was @entity9 , who @entity0 says was always on time and her easiest client to work with			1
@entity146 , @entity9 and @entity8 at a press conference on the occasion of the opening of their " @entity150 " in @entity152 in may , 1997 @entity8 and @entity102 with @entity153 in 1998 at the @entity153 ss99 fashion show fashion designer @entity155 with @entity8 , @entity9 in 1997 @entity0 would also make sure that she held a set of keys to every hotel room her clients were in , so that she could physically drag them out of bed if necessary			1
she says in her new book : ' you learn to manage lateness with a series of updates ( lies ) to those concerned			0
“ we are leaving the hotel ” ( still asleep , one hour late ) ; ' “ we ’re in the car ” ( just out of bed , two hours late ) ; “ we ’re in a traffic jam ” ( just got in the car , three hours late ) ; “ we broke down ! ” ( almost there , really pushing our luck )			0
' the girls also used their tardiness as part of a competition with each other as they did n't want to be the first on set			0
