wounded : @entity0 claimed he was injured in an attempted mugging , but that was untrue a pub landlord who became a local hero after claiming he single - handedly fought off four muggers made the whole thing up , it has emerged			1
@entity0 has been fined for lying to police over the amazing story , which made national headlines			1
at the time of the alleged attack , he proudly showed off the stomach wound he said they had given him - but now the origins of the injury are a total mystery			1
the 37 - year - old told police and reporters that he had been attacked by four men outside a takeaway in @entity21 , @entity22 , but managed to fight them off without even dropping the chips he had bought			1
but after officers started investigating the story in an attempt to prosecute the muggers , it quickly unravelled as they discovered there was no @entity32 footage of the incident and concluded that the attack never took place at all			1
now @entity0 has been issued with an £ 80 fixed penalty notice for wasting police time after apparently admitting he had fabricated after the incident earlier this month he was hospitalised with a serious stomach wound which required 18 stitches , and it is now unclear how the damage was sustained			1
he denies lying to police , and told the @entity42 that the only reason he accepted the fine was ' just to get this bloody matter finished '			2
@entity46 , of @entity47 , said today : ' this man not only wasted police time , but he also raised the fear of crime in the local community			2
' i hope this serves as a lesson to anyone who thinks they can lie to the police and get away with it			2
' brave : pub landlord @entity0 , pictured with his fiancée @entity58 , became a local hero after the fabricated tale of his exploits in fighting off his attackers spread scene : the incident allegedly happened shortly after mr @entity0 left @entity65 in @entity21 at the time @entity0 said he had put martial arts training from when he was a teenager into good use to fend off his attackers			1
he said : ' the men stopped me and demanded my phone and wallet			2
i told them that if they wanted it they 'd have to come and get it			2
tough ? mr @entity0 shows his bruised knuckles outside his pub , the @entity79 ' they all came at me at once , i kicked two of them in the leg			1
i used to do a little bit of aikido and i remembered to go for the knees			2
they fell to the floor and could n't get up			0
' as i did that another clipped me in the face			0
i turned around and hit him and he fell			0
i turned around again and the other one came at me with what i thought was a knife			0
' he just lunged and i felt a sharp twang in my side			0
i grabbed his hands so he could n't bring it out and stab again			0
i pulled it out myself , disarmed him and then hit him			0
i think he was knocked out			0
' then i just got in my car and left , i did n't even drop the chips			1
' @entity0 , who owns the @entity79 in @entity103 , then supposedly drove back to fiancée @entity58 's house with their food			1
when his wound would n't stop bleeding , @entity0 went to @entity108 in @entity109 several hours later where he needed 15 internal and three external stitches			1
doctors said at the time that his injuries looked like they had been inflicted with a sharpened screwdriver			0
@entity0 said : ' the screwdriver deflected off my ribs apparently , it was a millimetre away from going into my lung			1
if it had gone through that it would have hit my liver , i was very lucky			0
' if it had been a couple of inches over it could have been me lying in the alleyway			0
i dread to think what would have happened if it was somebody else in that situation			0
' my fiancée was going to go for the fish and chips but i said it was too dangerous			0
i would never have forgiven myself if i had let her go and she 'd been attacked			2

@entity0 said he was attacked as he left a takeaway and fought muggers
but now he is fined £ 80 after it emerges his whole story was made up
unclear how he sustained stomach wound which required 18 stitches
