by @entity0 published : 05:23 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 2 may 2013 a five - year - old autistic boy was left behind on a school bus for two hours after falling asleep during the journey			1
@entity4 , who attends a special needs primary school at @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , was abandoned after the bus assistant failed to ensure he was escorted safely to the school with the other children			1
his parents were furious when they found out what had happened , as their son could have been in danger had he not been discovered in time			0
five - year - old @entity4 , who has learning disabilities , was left behind on the school bus the bizarre incident happened after the minibus picked him up at home as usual and took him to @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , arriving at 8.30am			1
the driver then drove off to a friend 's house unaware that the youngster , who has learning difficulties and finds it hard to communicate , was still on board asleep			1
it was not until 10.30am , when the driver sounded the horn of the bus to say goodbye to his friend , that @entity34 woke up and was finally discovered			1
five - year - old @entity4 attends a special needs primary school at @entity7 in @entity9 his mother , @entity38 , 34 , and her husband @entity40 , 35 , did not know about the drama until 11am , when the school called to tell them			1
mrs @entity43 , of @entity44 , said : ' we were extremely upset that this had happened to a child with a disability who finds it hard to communicate			0
' we appreciate that @entity34 has had time off school due to illness many times , but i want to make sure that this does not happen to any child again , whether disabled or not			2
' @entity34 's uncle , @entity58 , 33 , who has been liaising with the school on behalf of his parents , said : ' the school apologised but we felt they did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation and blamed the council transport service			1
' my belief is that if there had been the right procedures in place it would not have happened			0
' mr @entity58 added : ' it could have been more serious - it 's not what happened but what could have happened			1
' the assistant employed by the taxi firm has since been dismissed and the driver reprimanded			1
@entity7 headteacher @entity74 said : ' transport is provided by the local authority			0
they organise contracts with different taxi firms			0
' the escorts , who are employed by the taxi firms , are responsible for ensuring all children are delivered to the school by handing them over to school staff			2
' unfortunately this child was left on the bus unbeknown to the members of staff attending to arrivals			2
the bus door was closed and it was assumed all children had been released			2
' she added : ' the child in question has been ill previously with a severe ear infection and a message has always been relayed to the teacher about his absence during the morning			0
so it was not entirely unusual for him not to be on the bus			2
' it is school policy to contact parents mid-morning if a child does not attend and there is no telephone message from home to explain their absence			0
' to prevent this from ever happening again , the new escort is being provided with a tick sheet to record who has been collected each day			0
' a @entity115 spokesman said : ' the safety and well being of all children using home - to - school transport is a top priority			1
we therefore took this incident extremely seriously as the situation clearly was not acceptable			0
' we are working with the school to ensure there is a robust procedure in place which would avoid any similar incident happening in the future			0
