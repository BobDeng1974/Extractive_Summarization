@entity0 , a physics student at @entity1 , said his prospective trip to @entity3 is putting a dampner on his love life one of the @entity7 volunteers who wants to be chosen for a pioneering mission to @entity3 has admitted that the prospective one - way journey is hampering his love life			1
@entity0 , 21 , is the youngest - and the only man - among five @entity7 who have been shortlisted for the @entity11 , which is aiming to send people to live in space by 2025			1
the @entity1 physics student , who is also president of @entity15 and @entity16 , applied for the trip because he wants to leave a legacy			1
but he said today that the potential life - changing mission leaves him with little hope of finding love			1
he told @entity23 : ' being single makes it easier for me at the moment because what kind of conversation start is it to say " i 'm going to be leaving the planet in the next 10 years "			1
' i 'm full - on focused on the mission ... so i would n't be able to have a future with anyone if i started a relationship			2
' but mr @entity0 , from @entity34 , said he ' would n't rule out ' an extra-terrestrial relationship once he has been propelled into space			2
mr @entity0 has been shortlisted for the mission alongside @entity47 , 23 , a phd student in astronomy at @entity49 , dr @entity37 , 35 , a lab technician from south east @entity39 , @entity40 , 24 , an astrophysics student at the @entity41 , and @entity42 , 27 , a systems information manager from @entity44 , @entity45			1
the @entity51 candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews			0
they include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round			0
the majority of the 100 applicants come from the @entity60 , 31 from @entity61 , 16 from @entity62 , seven from @entity63 and seven from @entity64			0
the team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven - month journey from @entity67			2
mr @entity0 , a sci - fi fan , is currently designing a @entity70 camera for a future sample return mission to @entity3 ’s @entity72 , which could one day select the first landing site on the moons of @entity3			1
of his enthusiasm for the @entity77 mission , he said : ‘ to search for evidence of past or present life , to speak to and inspire school children back on @entity67 , to build the first civilisation on another planet … how could anyone say no to that ! ’ he added : ' the most important thing to do in life is to leave a legacy			2
a lot of people do that by having a child , having a family			0
for me this would be my legacy			0
' mr @entity0 ( left ) has been shortlisted alongside @entity42 ( right ) , 27 , from @entity44 , @entity45 @entity40 ( pictured ) , 24 , an astrophysics phd student at the @entity41 was also chosen while the experience may be amazing , it will certainly be tough			1
the crew of four will have to contend with temperatures as low as -62c and high radiation levels			0
they could also be at risk of suffocation , starvation and dehydration			0
if all goes well , additional teams would join the settlement every two years , with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on @entity3			2
there , they will collect data , plant oxygen - producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation			0
in spite of the risks , more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the @entity124 - based group called for volunteers to join the mission in 2011			1
in the next stage , which may involve ' rigorous , potentially televised competitions ' to test individuals ' responses to stressful situations , the current shortlist will be reduced to 40			0
@entity47 ( left ) a phd student in astronomy at @entity49 and dr @entity37 , a 35 - year - old laboratory technician from @entity136 ( right ) are also through to the next round of selection @entity139 , the production company behind @entity140 , said last year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the @entity146			1
candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice			0
any chosen @entity3 settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million - mile ( 482 million km ) pioneering mission			1
last year , researchers at the @entity155 found that any manned mission to @entity3 would result in the crew dying after 68 days , while critics have pointed out that the estimated cost of @entity77 is a fraction of the amount proposed by @entity162			1
the privately - funded mission is estimated to cost $ 6 billion ( £ 4 billion )			2
the robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018 , followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022			0
the time frame for this next stage depends on how long it takes the team to sort through the 100 on the list , but candidates are expected to know whether they have made the cut by the end of this year .			0
