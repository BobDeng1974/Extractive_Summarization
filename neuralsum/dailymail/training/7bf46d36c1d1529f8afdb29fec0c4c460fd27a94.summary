@entity0 picked up his first point as @entity3 manager and provoked a touchline tantrum from @entity6 assistant coach @entity5 with his adversary storming down the tunnel after being sent off			1
sociedad hired @entity0 to provoke a reaction and he got one from his team who gave a much improved display that so nearly delivered their first win on the road this season but there was also a reaction from former basketball player @entity5 when @entity0 suggested he calmed down 29 minutes into the first half			1
@entity6 coach @entity21 had upset the fourth official and when the referee came across to speak to the home team ’s bench @entity5 said something and was sent off			1
when he walked past the @entity3 bench @entity0 gestured with his hands for the former fitness coach to calm down at which point he approached the former @entity32 and @entity33 manager before being ushered away from the field of play			1

booked : @entity73 referee : @entity90 attendance : 18,521 ' i do n’t know [ what the sending off was for ] i was in my dug - out and he was in his dug - out			0
i do n’t not what the problem was but he seemed quite angry about something , ' said @entity0 about the incident after full - time			1
on the pitch @entity0 ’ first game in charge might easily have offered up all three points had his team coupled dogged defending with better finishing			1
@entity108 , @entity79 and @entity76 combined on 12 minutes only for @entity6 keeper @entity109 to save @entity108 ’ shot with his face			2
@entity80 then teed up @entity76 only for the former @entity113 man to fire over			0
the visitors were not having it all their own way and @entity70 saved well from @entity117			2
they also grew in confidence in the second half but real better than they have down so far this season and they still forced chances at the other end with @entity108 ’ shot saved by @entity109 and @entity79 shooting just wide			2
sociedad also had keeper @entity128 to thank for the point after he made a brilliant late save from @entity130			0
they had earned their point throwing themselves in front of @entity6 shots late on to ensure @entity0 did n’t go back to @entity136 empy - handed			1
it was n’t quite the start of some of @entity141 ’s greatest coaching imports			0
@entity143 won his first game in charge of @entity146 4 - 2 , @entity142 won his 3 - 0 and @entity147 enjoyed a 2 - 1 victory on his bow as @entity151 coach			2
but there was plenty about the performance to encourage @entity0 who has only had a week to work with the players and was hit by injuries in the build up to the game			2
he was without experienced midfielders @entity158 and @entity160			0
and central defender @entity161 pulled out late with a bruised left leg			0
as far as @entity0 ’ overseas predecessors in the @entity3 hot - seat are concerned a draw was as well as both @entity166 in the 1930 - 31 season and @entity168 in the 1985 - 86 campaign did			1
it was also better than the start made by @entity172 whose team lost 2 - 0 to @entity174 on the first day of the 2007 - 08 season			0
he now has a full week to prepare for his first home game against @entity177 next saturday			0
@entity0 ' - showcasing his football skills - was involved in a heated exchange with @entity6 assistant @entity5 in the first half a tight game saw neither side able to break the deadlock in their @entity185 clash at the @entity42 @entity3 winger @entity80 ( right ) dribbles past two @entity6 defenders during their @entity185 clash on saturday night the @entity187 ( left ) challenges for a header with @entity6 's @entity190 at the @entity42			1

@entity3 are still without an away win in @entity185 this term following saturday 's draw at @entity6
@entity3 boss @entity0 was involved in a touchline spat with @entity6 assistant @entity5
@entity5 reacted angrily to @entity0 ' hand gesture to calm down after he was sent off in the first half
the visitors *spurned* several good chances in the first half to take the lead
@entity6 *dominated* large spells of *possession* in the second half and could have won it with chances of their own
