not long ago , when talking about computer storage , the gigabyte was considered an enormous amount of space to have on a personal computer			1
the likes of terabytes ( 1,000 gigabytes ) were the domain of scientists and tech giants			1
but in an increasingly online world companies such as @entity10 and @entity11 are storing never - imagined quantities of data			1
so now they currently deal in terms of petabytes			1
and beyond that there are exabytes , zettabytes , yottabytes and ... nothing else ; there is no language to describe at amount of data larger than that			1
it was recognised at the 19th @entity44 in 1991 along with zetta , for 21 zeroes ( and their submultiple counterparts , zepto and yocto )			1
in march 2010 ago a campaign to name the number 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ' hella ' attracted strong support from scientists			1
an online petition that started in @entity54 - where the word ' hella ' is slang for ' many ' - called for the word to become an internationally recognised prefix , joining the likes of mega , kilo and giga			2
the word would apply to figures with 27 zeros after the first digit			2
supporters of the campaign believe recent breakthroughs in science mean the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) needs to go further with its classification of long numbers			2
campaign organiser @entity74 , from the @entity76 , said at the time that the name hella would be an appropriate choice			2
' since the @entity70 system has traditionally adopted the last names of accomplished scientists for unit nomenclature , it follows that prefix designation should do the same , ' he said			0
' from this tradition comes the chance for the @entity70 system to use nomenclature to honor a constantly overlooked scientific contributor : @entity54			0
' the area is also notorious for the creation and widespread usage of the @entity95 slang ' hella , ' which typically means ' very , ' or can refer to a large quantity ( e.g. ' there are hella stars out tonight ' )			0
long way to go : the number would not be needed by @entity102 's count the campaign has attracted the interest of a @entity106 chemist who helps advise the @entity44			1
professor @entity107 of the @entity108 said at the time : ' the prefixes we introduced 20 years ago are still not widely used			0
there is no point making changes that nobody pays any attention to which would only make things more complicated			0
' at the moment we are focusing on more pressing issues , such as redefining the weight of the kilogram			0
but he is correct to say that we will need prefixes to express a greater range of magnitudes as science advances			0
the very fact that a student is asking a question like this is very encouraging			0
' prof @entity131 suggested that a simpler option would be for the committee to relax rules banning compound prefixes , so that , for instance , a hella could be expressed as a @entity139 suggest the next prefix will be ' xenna ' , after the @entity143 ' ennea ' for nine , though they could also go with ' nonna ' , ' enna ' , or any other similar variation of the @entity143 or @entity147			0
but nothing can be decided until the @entity44 convenes again			1
and until such time @entity11 and @entity10 can continue their march into the unknown .			0

currently the largest measurement is a yottabyte
new terminology can only be approved by the @entity44
