one of at least four airmen captured by @entity2 militants after their @entity5 @entity3 helicopter crash - landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric			1
the pilot , who was captured near @entity10 in @entity12 province , is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi @entity16 rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle			1
@entity20 , who has long been affiliated with @entity2 - linked groups in @entity5 , suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the @entity5 regime releases notorious jihadi @entity25 as - @entity26 , who is wanted in @entity27 for suspected links to the 1985 @entity29 and 2004 @entity31 bombings			1
clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash , the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head			2
the footage is decidedly amateur , is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick , professionally edited videos put out by @entity62 's rival jihadi group @entity63			0
nevertheless , the sight of @entity20 standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any @entity69 release			2
@entity20 's primary demand is that the @entity5 regime release @entity25 as - @entity26 - a notorious @entity2 linked militant who was arrested in @entity71 in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland			1
@entity75 - born as - @entity26 - who holds @entity27 citizenship remains a wanted man in @entity27 on suspicion of taking part in the @entity80 's 1985 bombing at @entity31 's @entity29 restaurant , which left 18 dead			1
he is also wanted as a possible witness to the @entity2 - inspired coordinated bombings on the @entity31 's train system , which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in march 2004			2
