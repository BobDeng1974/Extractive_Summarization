by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 14 june 2012 updated : 18:14 est , 14 june 2012 ' deeply unprofessional ' : met police commissioner @entity1 has voiced his support for the government 's new ' snoopers charter ' @entity7 's most senior police officer was accused of playing politics yesterday after he gave his full backing to @entity5 plans to monitor the public ’s every internet click			1
metropolitan police commissioner @entity1 endorsed a draft law that critics claim amounts to a snoopers ’ charter , saying that in some cases it could be a matter of ‘ life or death ’			1
his actions were branded ‘ deeply unprofessional ’ and prompted calls for official censure			1
mr @entity1 ’s intervention in the @entity24 was compared to that of former @entity27 commissioner sir @entity26 , who was accused of lobbying for a @entity29 plan to allow terrorism suspects to be detained for up to 90 days and also backed controversial id cards			1
@entity33 mp @entity32 said : ‘ just as it was wrong for sir @entity26 to lobby for the flawed id card scheme , it is deeply unprofessional for @entity37 to lobby for @entity39 surveillance			1
' it politicises our police and undermines public trust			2
it ’s also shocking that he wants more surveillance powers to “ eliminate innocent people from an investigation ”			2
‘ in this country , we ’re innocent until proven guilty – not the other way round			1
’ former shadow home secretary @entity51 , one of the most outspoken critics of the proposed law , said : ‘ he will have done his reputation no end of harm by getting involved in this process			0
’ he said that after sir @entity26 spoke out on 90 days detention he was seen as a @entity5 spokesman and , if not careful , the same would be said of mr @entity1			0
he added : ‘ the truth of the matter is this is a highly political issue and the police should stay out of it			0
’ mr @entity1 made the comments yesterday in an article for @entity67 , in which he brought the 2005 @entity70 murder investigation into his argument , saying police were able to disprove @entity74 ’s alibi that he did not kill schoolgirls @entity75 and @entity75 by looking at his phone and text records			2
he also appeared alongside home secretary @entity79 at a press conference to promote the draft @entity24			2
if made law , it will give ministers powers to demand that internet companies store data on every website visit , email , text message and visit to social networking sites for a minimum of 12 months			1
police and security services would not have access to the content of messages , but would know who was contacted , when and by what method			0
caught : mobile phone data was crucial in securing convictions against serial murderer @entity102 , left , and @entity70 killer @entity74 , right the @entity103 is expected to face fierce criticism from @entity105 and @entity33 backbenchers when it is scrutinised by @entity107			1
currently , police can access information that is stored automatically by internet companies , but they say that 25 per cent of the data is not logged , leaving a loophole for determined criminals			1
mrs may said that without the new powers , offenders would go free			0
‘ we will see people walking the streets who should be behind bars , ’ she said			0
loss of freedom : police will be entitled to know the address of every email we send or receive , every website or social networking forum we visit , and the number and identity of everyone we speak to on the telephone sitting alongside her , mr @entity1 claimed the proposals were no more intrusive than current laws			1
but in facing repeated questions over whether he was right to intervene so publicly , the commissioner accepted there was a risk of the police becoming politicised over the issue			2
‘ you could say there is a risk [ of politicisation ] , but the thing i ’m passionate about is making sure criminals ca n’t get away with crime , ’ he said			0
‘ if that ’s regarded as political , it ’s a sorry state of affairs			0
’ but @entity151 , director of pressure group @entity152 , said : ‘ we saw under the @entity29 administration the perils of police officers becoming cheerleaders for @entity5 policies which attack fundamental liberties while enhancing the powers of the police			0
‘ this is a self - interested power - grab and an unacceptable intervention in policing by an operational police officer			0
‘ i expect the mayor of @entity167 to censure @entity1 for the same kind of politicking that the @entity170 rightly criticised @entity26			0
’ the law is a reprieve of measures proposed by @entity29 which were defeated twice with opposition from the @entity105 and @entity33 .			2

met police commissioner *slammed* for his public support of the government 's @entity24
@entity33 mp @entity32 accuses him of being ' deeply unprofessional ' and jeopardising *principle* of ' innocent until proven guilty '
@entity103 would force *communications* companies to store data on every website visit , email , text message and social network use for 12 months
