by @entity0 a mother who was told she could not breastfeed her newborn in a hospital waiting room yesterday condemned the ‘ disgusting ’ way the @entity5 had treated her			1
@entity6 was reduced to tears after nurses put her in a private room so she could feed six - week - old @entity10 without offending other patients			1
she was asked to move even though none of the other six women in the waiting room at the time had complained			1
not allowed : @entity6 was left in tears after being barred from feeding six - week - old @entity10 while she waited for a blood test with her husband at the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 mrs @entity6 , 37 , had gone to the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , for tests to see whether she still had the gestational diabetes she developed in pregnancy			1
she was particularly shocked because she had gone to the trouble of calling the hospital before her appointment to make sure she would be able to breastfeed her daughter after it wrote to say it offered no childcare facilities and that the procedure would require two blood tests with a two - hour wait in between			1
mrs @entity6 , head of marketing and development at children ’s charity @entity37 , said : ‘ @entity38 can be difficult enough already			1
you need all the support you can get			2
‘ the @entity5 encourages breastfeeding , particularly in a baby ’s early weeks			0
i certainly did n’t expect to be told in a hospital that i could n’t breastfeed			2
’ last straw : mrs @entity6 said she was left tearful by the hospital 's attitude , on what was six - week - old baby @entity10 's first major outing investigation : a spokesman for @entity51 and @entity52 said it was aware of mrs @entity6 's complaint the row comes after 1,000 women staged a series of nationwide protests on saturday in support of @entity60 , 27 , from @entity61 , @entity62 , who was branded a ‘ tramp ’ on @entity65 alongside a picture of her breastfeeding in public			1
mrs @entity6 , from @entity20 , said she was confronted by a nurse who spotted @entity10 in her pram moments after arriving at the hospital with husband @entity73 , 43			1
she added : ‘ the nurse said i should n’t have brought @entity10 and that i might offend other patients by breastfeeding			1
‘ she suggested i should have considered expressing milk into a bottle for @entity73 to feed her			2
but if you introduce a bottle too soon the baby can get used to it and stop feeding from the breast			2
it was only thanks to another nurse overhearing the conversation that i was offered a private room to breastfeed in			1
otherwise i would have been turned away			0
’ other case : @entity60 , mother of eight - month - old daughter @entity89 , was labelled a ' tramp ' for breastfeeding in public , before hitting back by organising a mass breastfeeding protest backing : more than 1,000 mothers took to the streets in towns and cities around @entity96 at the weekend and breastfed in public to show their support for the young mother mrs @entity6 said she quickly fed @entity10 before her husband stepped in to look after their daughter while she was tested			1
yesterday the hospital claimed there was a health and safety risk to mothers at the appointments			2
it said patients attending the tests were at risk of fainting , so they should not bring babies with them			0
it added that the procedure also required the women to sit still between the tests			0
however , mr @entity118 , a director of an environmental consultancy , said : ‘ we understand how this could be an issue if a mother attended on her own with the child , as there would be nobody to look after the baby if she fainted			0
‘ but i was with @entity6 and @entity10 on this occasion and was able to step in			1
’ campaigners criticised the hospital yesterday			0
breastfeeding counsellor @entity130 , of the @entity132 , said : ‘ it ’s against civil law for a business or organisation to ask a breastfeeding mother to move from a particular space			0
the only time such a stance could be justified is if the baby ’s life could be put in danger , such as if the mother needed to have an x-ray and wanted to take her baby in			0
’ @entity147 , professional policy adviser at the @entity148 , branded the hospital ’s actions ‘ disgraceful ’ , adding : ‘ women should be able to breastfeed anywhere they choose			0
’ @entity153 policy adviser @entity152 said it was ‘ inexcusable that the @entity5 has mistreated this woman ’			0
mrs @entity6 has complained to @entity51 and @entity5 , and is due to meet @entity156 , its chief operating officer			2
yesterday he said the trust supported breastfeeding and was investigating her claims			0
gestational diabetes affects women during pregnancy , when there are high levels of glucose in the blood			2
women over 35 are thought to carry a higher risk of developing it			0
the condition usually clears up after birth .			0

@entity6 , 37 , was barred from feeding six - week - old @entity10
she had been waiting for blood test at @entity19 in @entity20
claimed that nurses told her to feed her daughter in a private room
says : ' i was left *speechless* , upset and very angry by their attitude '
