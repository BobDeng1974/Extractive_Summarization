winter weary @entity0 have been given a timely reminder that @entity3 has finally sprung			0
@entity4 has been turning heads in some of the city 's coolest neighborhoods ever since restaurant owner @entity8 , 34 , and his girlfriend @entity9 , 24 , adopted him			1
but now the couple - and @entity4 's impressive legion of fans - have been left devastated after city officials demanded he is taken out of the metropolis			1
' i 'll be sad to see him go because he 's so loving but we 're officially adopting him which means he will never end up on a dinner plate			0
' we 'll visit as often as we can – @entity8 has even taken lamb off the menu at his restaurant @entity43 , in tribute to @entity4			1
' @entity4 has caused a few disasters while he 's been here but he 's a farmyard animal so it 's to be expected			2
' we 're still going to miss him hugely			0
' devotion : @entity9 ( pictured ) and @entity8 bottle - feed @entity4 three times a day and have to burp him after he has eaten friendly face : @entity4 has been growing quickly since arriving in the city - and is much more confident than he was when he first moved into @entity8 's apartment accidents do happen : @entity9 admitted that @entity4 is a bit like a ' dog which has not been potty trained ' she added : ' everybody should own a lamb – he is great and so loving			1
' i guess he 's like a dog which has not been potty trained			0
' @entity4 was born at @entity62 in @entity63 but was abandoned by his mother and would have likely died in the cold			1
fortunately @entity8 , who runs @entity66 - based restaurant @entity43 , agreed to take him in when contacted by the farmer and @entity4 was smuggled into his tiny apartment in the city 's @entity28 ' @entity8 told me that he had adopted a lamb and i said he was crazy – we could n't look after a lamb , ' @entity9 explained			1
something for everyone : the couple believe that everybody should get the chance to own a lamb crazy : when @entity8 first told @entity9 that he had adopted a lamb from a farm in @entity63 , she admits she thought the idea was ridiculous @entity83 : ' when i saw him my heart melted , ' @entity9 admits keep clean : in addition to his regular bottle feeds , @entity9 and @entity8 have to bathe @entity4 regularly , ensuring that they only use water so that his fleece does n't shrink ' but when i saw him my heart melted - he was so cute			1
' he must have been around 3 or 4 pounds and was wearing a little diaper with his tail sticking out			0
he was so sweet and loving			0
' @entity4 is bottle - fed three times a day and needs to be burped like a baby after he has had his formula			2
he needs regular baths and can only be washed with water so his fleece does not shrink			0
@entity9 added : ' we take him out for regular walks in the park – he really loves that			2
restaurant revolution : since adopting @entity4 , @entity8 has removed all lamb dishes from the menu at his @entity66 restaurant , @entity106 take a seat : often @entity4 will spend time with restaurant - goers , keeping them entertained while they wait for their food fan club : the people of @entity0 have quickly fallen in love with @entity4 's charming personality let me take a selfie ! @entity4 has quickly become a social media star ; almost everyone who meets him wants to snap a picture with the popular pet ' @entity4 never needs a lead because he just likes to follow us around			1
' in many ways he 's better than a dog but i 've never known a dog that needs to be bottle fed – or who poops and pees so much			0
' whenever i stay at @entity8 's apartment i will sleep in the bed and @entity8 will sleep in the living room with @entity4			1
' we ca n't let him in the bedroom because he will make a big mess in there			0
' people in the city love him , it 's hard to get too far when you have @entity4 with you			2
they 'll do double takes then run back to stroke him and take pictures – he 's so popular			0
