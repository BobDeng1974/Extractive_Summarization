films such as @entity1 and @entity2 may be made to be watched in @entity3 on a cinema screen , but a @entity6 agency claims that such films could damage children ’s eyesight			1
@entity10 , @entity6 's national health and safety agency , has called for a ban on stereoscopic technology such as 3d films and games for children under the age of six , while it recommends that children below the age of 13 should only use the technology occasionally			1
however , one vision expert claims there is little evidence to back up a ban , as only short - term discomfort has been recorded in children and adults watching 3d films			1
the @entity6 health and safety executive , @entity10 , has called for ban on stereoscopic technology such as 3d films ( a still from @entity32 's @entity1 which was shown in @entity3 is pictured ) and games for children under the age of six , while it recommends that children below the age of 13 should only watch the occasionally @entity10 , the country 's @entity35 , published a research paper claiming that a ban should be considered because of ‘ the possible [ negative ] effect of 3d viewing on the developing visual system			1
’ the human vision system changes ‘ significantly ’ during infancy , including parts of the brain that perceive depth , associated with 3d films , according to an article by @entity49 , professor of vision science at the @entity51 , published in @entity52			2
children under the age of six should not be exposed to 3d technologies			2
children under the age of 13 should only use 3d technologies in moderation and both they and their parents should be vigilant concerning any resulting symptoms			2
people prone to certain visual disorders ( disorders of accommodation and vergence for example ) and problems with balance should limit their exposure to these technologies			0
changes occur until the teenage years and the visual experiences a child receives , affects the development of binocular circuits , which are needed for depth perception			0
‘ these observations mean that there should be careful monitoring of how the new technology affects young children , ’ he warned			0
he writes that two properties of binocular vision - vergence and accommodation – which can come into conflict when watching 3d films to produce a feeling of discomfort , seem to be troubling the @entity6 experts			1
in everyday life , our eyes move from one object to another			0
when the eyes are focused on an object , vergence is ‘ acute ’ and the viewer sees a single object , not two			0
@entity10 ’ research paper says a ban should be considered because of ‘ the possible [ negative ] effect of @entity40 on the developing visual system , ' whereas a vision expert claims that there is no evidence to suggest long - term damage from watching 3d films ( illustrated with a stock picture ) to get a single , sharp image , the eyes are focused to produce a clear image on the retina , while an image is focused by changing the curvature of the lens within each eye , which is known as ‘ accommodation ’			1
usually , both properties of binocular vision are operating on one object placed a certain distance away from the eye , but in 3d films , the image appears in front or behind the screen			1
the difference in distance means that there can be a conflict , which makes images appear blurry to some people			0
this blurriness has been proven to cause some people discomfort			0
however , professor @entity49 says there is no existing evidence to prove that adverse effects from watching 3d films cause permanent damage to humans ’ eyesight			2
‘ on that basis.it seems rash to recommend these age - related bans and restrictions , ’ he said			0
he acknowledges that there are always health risks with the widespread roll out of new technology , but there is ‘ no smoking gun to suggest harm is being caused , ’ adding that a ban on 3d films for children seems ‘ unnecessarily harsh ’ .			1

@entity154 - based @entity10 has called for ban on 3d technology for children
a vision expert claims there is little evidence to back up a ban
this is because on short - term effects of 3d technology have been seen
films can cause discomfort because of a ' conflict ' of binocular vision
