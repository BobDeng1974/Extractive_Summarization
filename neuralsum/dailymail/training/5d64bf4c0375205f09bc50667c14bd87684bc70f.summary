by @entity0 published : 20:25 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 13 november 2012 the senior bankers who brought @entity2 to the edge of financial collapse will enjoy pension nest eggs totalling more than £ 100million			1
the biggest winners are receiving – or will receive when they retire – gold - plated pensions worth at least £ 300,000 a year , with one landing a massive £ 1.4million			1
by comparison , the average private sector worker does not even have a company pension			2
the basic state pension is worth a maximum of just £ 5,600 a year			1
financial futures : @entity15 's annual pension is a cool £ 1.4million while @entity16 ( right ) picks up £ 342,500 an investigation looked at the directors of the five banks – @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 ( owner of @entity24 ) , @entity25 and @entity26 – which were bailed out by the taxpayer following the credit crunch			1
the total transfer value of pensions for the 23 executive directors on the boards of the five banks when they failed is a total £ 107million			2
@entity33 , a leading @entity35 peer , said : ‘ irresponsible bankers will enjoy these vast fruits of failures for the rest of their lives			2
‘ that really sticks in the throats of hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs or businesses , and millions whose pensions were savaged by the banking crash			0
’ the golden nest eggs : the bankers who will pick up huge pensions despite their actions the research , by @entity53 , added in one extra director – sir @entity55 , the former chief executive of @entity22 , who left in 2006 after aggressively expanding the bank			0
among the big winners is @entity16 , the former chief executive of @entity20 , who was later stripped of his knighthood			0
he was entitled to an annual pension of £ 703,000 , but eventually volunteered to cut it to £ 342,500 a year after a public outcry			1
unimpressed : @entity33 hit out at the pension sizes , saying they ' stick in the throat ' of those who lost out in the crash his former rival , @entity67 at @entity25 , which was the first bank to collapse in the financial crisis , will get £ 305,000 a year			1
@entity69 , a @entity70 mp who sits on the @entity71 , said : ‘ the banks have not got the message at all			0
‘ they presume that one way or the other they will get away with their role [ in the crisis ]			0
and these pensions demonstrate that , in a way , they have got away with it			0
’ other winners include @entity83 , the former @entity22 banker , who was given a £ 500,000 fine and a lifetime ban by the @entity87 regulator in september for his role in the banking crisis			2
mr @entity83 , who gets a pension worth £ 369,000 a year , insists his treatment by the @entity92 was ‘ tokenism at its most sinister ’			1
rewarded : @entity67 ( left ) of @entity25 takes £ 305,000 a year while @entity83 picks up £ 369,000 the biggest beneficiary is @entity15 , who ran @entity20 ’s @entity95 operations citizens before its collapse , who gets a pension of £ 1.4million a year			1
@entity101 , assistant general secretary of the @entity103 union , said : ‘ these bankers failed the nation and they failed their staff – they are the real undeserving being allowed to walk away with gold - plated pensions			0
‘ when you look at these eye - watering payments , it is astonishing that @entity103 is having to campaign for a living wage for the lowest paid staff at these banks			0

@entity15 will take home £ 1.4million a year with the rest *earning* at least £ 300k
