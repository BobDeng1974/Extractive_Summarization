still savouring those victorious scenes from @entity1 ? on the @entity3 , they ’ve moved on already			1
in @entity5 on tuesday evening at a meeting of the @entity7 , the process will begin to choose @entity9 ’s successor as @entity11 captain			1
up for discussion are not only the candidates and the timeframe for the announcement , but the potentially crucial appointment of who will be the committee ’s representative			1
that person will then join the last three captains ( @entity21 , @entity23 - @entity22 and @entity9 ) plus the tour ’s chief executive @entity24 in making the choice			1
the popular view is chairman @entity28 will represent the committee but that might prove wide of the mark owing to an obvious conflict of interest			1
@entity33 ( left ) and @entity34 ( right ) are both in the frame to become 2016 @entity11 captain @entity28 ( left ) celebrates @entity39 's @entity38 victory with @entity40 if the @entity41 does n’t throw his hat into the ring this time , he would rightly be a strong candidate to be captain in @entity45 in 2018			1
in which case , should he be voting on the captain for 2016 when he would be virtually guaranteed that vote regarding his own candidature in @entity50 ? if @entity28 does n’t stand to be captain this time , we ’re seemingly down to a fight between @entity33 and @entity54 , and what a fascinating contest that promises to be			1
here you have two leading representatives from two different schools of thought			2
on the one hand you have a man who has won the highest honour the game can bestow and been a rock in previous @entity66 ; on the other you ’ve got @entity54 , a @entity9 - type figure who might not have won majors but understands the @entity11 and knows what it ’s like to captain a team of his peers			2
of the five who will make the decision , it ’s reasonable to assume @entity78 will go for @entity33 and @entity22 for his fellow @entity79			1
@entity24 will hope to be spared the casting vote			2
@entity9 ( centre ) has vowed to put his differences with @entity33 ( left ) aside when picking his successor as for @entity9 , he is too decent a man to let his well - documented fallout with @entity33 have an overriding bearing on his decision			1
rather , he will put in his usual due diligence , ask the leading players what they think and take it from there			2
which leaves the players ’ representative , and clearly a key man in deciding a contest that presently looks too close to call			1
expect the captain to be announced early in the @entity99 at a glitzy press conference in @entity101 or at @entity102			2
so much for the thought @entity104 interest in the @entity11 might wane because they keep losing			0
for evidence , just witness the extraordinary bloodletting that has been going on over the past week , culminating in captain @entity109 ’s remarkable mea culpa statement over the weekend			0
they care , all right			0
my favourite moment was @entity114 president @entity113 highlighting the fact that 2012 captain @entity116 was the only @entity104 incumbent this century who had been blooded in the manner of each @entity39 skipper , in first serving an apprenticeship as vice-captain			0
this from the man who appointed @entity109 , who had n’t been near a @entity11 in over 20 years ! @entity104 2012 @entity11 skipper @entity116 served as vice-captain before his appointment as captain forgotten amidst all the hankering for the return of @entity128 and his ‘ pod ’ system that proved successful in 2008 was the fact that @entity116 was actually a really good captain at @entity132			1
he just got unlucky when @entity133 holed a couple of putts from downtown on that miraculous sunday			0
as for the next @entity104 captain , there ’s a perfect candidate staring them in the face and it is n’t @entity128 , who ’ll just give the thing a nasty edge			0
‘ i regret that my words may have made the players feel that i did n’t appreciate their commitment and dedication to winning the @entity11			0
i was their captain and , in hindsight , whatever mistakes that were made were mine			0
’ @entity104 @entity11 captain @entity109 walks the higher ground following locker - room revelations from @entity1			0
what could possibly have made the players feel unappreciated ? perchance @entity160 less - than - inspiring rallying cry , on the eve of sunday ’s singles : ‘ this team sucks ’ ? @entity164 poses with his @entity165 after his victory at the @entity167 on sunday what is it about men from @entity171 and finding their way back at the @entity173 at @entity174 ? eleven years after @entity176 won there to kickstart his journey from the wilderness all the way to world no 1 , we now have the heartwarming story of @entity183 and his incredible victory on sunday			0
how wonderfully typical of this sport that the all - conquering world no 1 should get to the 17th , the most famous hole in the game , and putt from off the green into the @entity192 bunker , while the world no 792 , who had never won anywhere , should play a clutch 80 - yard shot to 3ft			0
given all he ’s achieved this year , it probably took @entity198 five minutes to get over his disappointment ; for @entity183 , it was the moment he had waited for all his life .			0
