by @entity0 published : 16:28 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 19 april 2013 @entity1 of @entity2 is to move back in with her mother when her baby is born			1
in a break with royal tradition , @entity5 , 31 , will not employ a maternity nurse after the july birth			1
instead , she has told friends , she will live with her parents for at least the first six weeks after leaving hospital			1
support : @entity1 of @entity2 is set to move in with her mother @entity14 following the birth of her first child , and future heir to the throne of @entity19 first home : the royal baby will spend at least the first six weeks of his or her life at the @entity14 's £ 4.85million manor in @entity25 the decision means a future monarch will be starting life in a commoner ’s home in @entity25 rather than in the splendour of a royal residence			1
@entity5 says she ‘ just feels safest and most secure ’ with her family and believes that no one could be better placed to teach her about bringing up a baby than her mother , who has three children of her own			2
new tradition : @entity1 of @entity2 will not employ a maternity nurse she will particularly need her advice and moral support when prince @entity41 returns to work as a helicopter pilot after taking his paternity leave			1
it also solves the niggling problem of where the newborn third - in - line to the throne will live for the first few weeks of his or her life			2
sources have confirmed that @entity41 and @entity5 ’s plans to move into a new apartment in @entity55 in time for the birth have hit a huge stumbling block			2
this follows the discovery of asbestos – which has to be cleared before the couple themselves , let alone a new - born child , can set foot inside			0
@entity5 ’s parents , @entity66 and @entity14 , recently bought a £ 4.85million @entity68 manor in rural @entity25 with plenty of space for their first grandchild to run around			1
a recent visitor said @entity14 , who is ‘ over the moon ’ at the prospect of being a grandmother , is busy overseeing the redecoration of the house – including the installation of a new kitchen and ‘ nursery - style ’ room			1
‘ @entity14 fully intends to be part of this baby ’s life and @entity85 , for her part , plans to spend a lot of time with her parents , especially while she is waiting for the new apartment to be completed , ’ they said			1
‘ and surely it is no bad thing this little prince or princess is given a taste of life outside of the @entity97 ? ’ at the moment , @entity5 and @entity41 are shuttling between their rented farmhouse in @entity101 , where @entity41 is based as a @entity103 pilot with the @entity104 , and @entity105 , a relatively modest two - up , two - down in the grounds of @entity55			0
they had hoped to move into their new home , the 57 - room @entity110 – well before the arrival of their first child			0
new home : the @entity116 and @entity5 , pictured during a visit to @entity118 , @entity119 earlier this month , are hoping to move in to their new apartment in @entity55 following the asbestos clear - up parent backing : @entity123 is set to put her trust in her parents @entity66 and @entity14 , pictured in their home village of @entity128 , instead of hiring a nurse for the royal baby 's first months prince @entity131 is to take part in a perilous charity trek to the @entity134 with a group of seriously injured ex-servicemen			1
the 28 - year - old , who recently returned from a second tour in @entity139 , will join a @entity19 team in the walking with the @entity141 2013			1
the challenge involves three teams from the @entity19 , @entity144 and @entity145 ( @entity146 and @entity147 ) racing across the @entity148 to the geographic @entity134			1
it aims to highlight the courage and determination of those who have been injured while serving their country			0
over four weeks in november and december , the teams will cover a total of 210 miles in temperatures as low as -45c and 50mph winds			2
in 2011 @entity131 spent five days with another team from the walking with the wounded charity trekking to the @entity161 before being forced to return home early to prepare for his brother ’s wedding			0
but , according to one well - placed source , @entity5 conceived almost as soon as they started trying for a baby following their official tour to the @entity171 last year , meaning it has become a race against time to get their new home ready			0
this week , however , the source said their scaffold - covered apartment is still ‘ virtually uninhabitable ’			0
aides confirmed the apartment was unlikely to be ready until at least september or october , meaning the new third - in - line to the throne will endure something of a peripatetic existence for the first few months of their young life			0
prince @entity41 was born in the private @entity186 at @entity188 ’s @entity187 , where @entity5 is also widely expected to give birth			0
afterwards he was taken home by @entity191 and @entity192 to their apartment at @entity55			0
@entity192 employed a paediatric nurse , @entity195 , to help her with @entity41 for the first month , after which a nanny , @entity196 , moved in			2
÷ @entity144 magazine @entity198 has named @entity5 for the third year running as one of the 100 most influential people in the world – alongside the likes of @entity203 and the @entity204			0
the publication described her as ‘ dignified , dutiful and unflappable ’ .			0

*duchess* of @entity2 to spend at least first six weeks with her parents
future @entity19 monarch will not be cared for by a maternity nurse
@entity14 and @entity213 recently bought £ 4.85m @entity25 manor
