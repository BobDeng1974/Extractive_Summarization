by @entity0 decay : pope @entity2 has attacked @entity4 's ' moral decay ' , citing child prostitutes and busy soup kitchens in his adopted home city as examples of society 's downfall pope @entity2 has attacked @entity4 's ' moral decay ' , citing child prostitutes and busy soup kitchens in his adopted home city as examples of society 's downfall			1
the 77 - year - old @entity12 spoke of the ' tremendous pain ' he felt over the darker side of the city in an interview to mark the feasts of @entity18			1
he also hit out at economic struggles , unemployment and @entity22 's falling birth rate , as well as expressing the view that communists had ' stolen ' the flag of @entity26			2
describing the exploitation of children as something that makes him ' suffer ' , the @entity2 told @entity4 - based newspaper @entity30 that he had been sickened to learn that in his native @entity32 there were girls as young as 12 working as prostitutes			1
' it made me sick			2
but even more so to see the powerful cars driven by old men pull up , ' he told the newspaper 's @entity41 correspondent @entity40			2
' they could have been their grandfathers			0
the little girl would be made up and the men would pay 15 pesos which would go towards buying drugs			0
' for me , the people who do this to girls are are paedophiles			2
' it also happens in @entity4			1
@entity4 , which should be a beacon in the world , is a mirror of society 's moral decay			1
' asked whether he was more afraid of the moral degradation , or the material poverty of a city , @entity2 said that both made him ' afraid ' , adding that people were having to turn to soup kitchens in @entity4 in order to feed their families			1
' an auxiliary bishop of @entity4 told me that many people go to the soup kitchen and in secret , full of shame , take home food , ' he said			1
the @entity2 also blamed @entity73 's economic struggles for a falling birth rate , both in @entity22 and other @entity73 countries as people worried they could not afford to start a family			1
' people are afraid of losing their jobs or not being able to pay the rent , ' he said			0
@entity22 has a very low birth rate , and in @entity88 it is the same			0
@entity89 is a bit better , but it is also low			0
' it is as if @entity73 has grown tired of being a mother , and would instead prefer to be a grandmother			0
' much of this is caused by the economic crisis , not just from a cultural shift marked by selfishness and hedonism			0
' but the @entity12 did have some positive marks for his new home , saying he found the people of @entity4 ' really likeable '			1
' i wish for them not to lose their joy , hope , and faith , despite the difficulties , ' he said			0
pope @entity2 was also asked about a blog post in the @entity111 magazine , which described him as sounding like a @entity112 due to his criticism of capitalism and calls for economic reform			1
children : @entity2 , who hugged a group of children during his audience in @entity120 last week , blamed @entity73 's economic struggles for @entity22 's falling birth rate ' i can only say that the communists have stolen our flag			1
the flag of the poor is @entity128			0
poverty is at the centre of the @entity132 , ' he said , citing @entity134 passages about the need to help the poor , the sick and the needy			2
' communists say that all this is communism			0
sure , twenty centuries later			0
so when they speak , one can say to them : " but then you are @entity128 " , ' he said			0
since his election in march 2013 , @entity2 has often attacked the global economic system as being insensitive to the poor and not doing enough to share wealth with those who need it most			1
on sunday @entity2 led his first major public ceremony since health problems forced a spate of cancelled appointments , and appeared to hold up well during the 90 - minute @entity153 in @entity154 to honour @entity18			1
the @entity41 has played down the cancellations , including one at the last minute on friday , attributing them without elaboration to some mild health problem			0
concerns : since his election in march 2013 , @entity2 has often attacked the global economic system as being insensitive to the poor and not doing enough to share wealth with those who need it most @entity2 chatted with each of 24 archbishops kneeling before him to receive a white woollen band symbolising shared episcopal power			2
he later addressed the faithful gathered in @entity120 and appealed for @entity170 's leaders to save the nation from further warfare			0
@entity2 then did what he has started doing recently when greeting the public - asking for prayers for him , too			2
' please do n't forget to pray for me , ' he said			0
these requests for prayers , combined with his recent quip that a pope 's job could be unhealthy and the cancellation of several appointments in the last few weeks , fuelled concern that perhaps @entity2 was seriously ill. the @entity41 insisted on friday ' there are no reasons to worry about the pope 's health ' .			1
