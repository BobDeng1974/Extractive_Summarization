@entity1 , 53 , was responding to a 999 call reporting a break - in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft - high wooden fence			1
yesterday it was revealed that the case had been settled out of court days before it was due to go before a judge			2
sources said the settlement added up to around £ 4,000 – just £ 1,000 less than the maximum amount she could have claimed had the case gone to court			2
the incident happened in 2009 when the @entity2 was called to @entity26 , a former school for the blind , after reports that youths had been spotted on the roof of the four - storey building			1
previously trespassers had set fire to part of the grounds , prompting the building ’s owner – property development firm @entity38 – to secure the perimeter with a 6ft fence			1
the only gap in the perimeter fence was a small gateway at the front of the site which was secured with a 3ft wooden fence			1
miss @entity1 , who serves with @entity3 police , said she suffered ‘ soft tissue damage ’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in @entity50 , near @entity51			1
in court papers , she claimed @entity38 was negligent because it had allowed the fence to become a ‘ danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises ’			1
the former dog trainer said the company had failed to make the wooden fencing safe and failed to properly warn her about the fencing by erecting warning signs			2
derelict : ms @entity1 was attending reports of a burglary at this former school in @entity50 when she tripped miss @entity1 also claimed there was no adequate system of inspection or maintenance of the site			1

however , he added that it was ‘ crazy ’ that members of the public could be sued by police going about their duties			0
‘ risks can not be removed from every situation , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s crazy that claims can be made by police officers in their line of work			0
' the nature of their job is risky , but they are there to protect the public			0
’ miss @entity1 ’s decision to sue was also condemned by her own force when it was revealed last month			1
chief superintendent @entity133 , of @entity134 , said the decision to make a claim was ‘ not a course of action that the force would encourage or support ’			0
and earlier this year home secretary @entity141 criticised ‘ frivolous ’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘ not the sort of attitude ’ they should exhibit			0
her comments came after @entity79 @entity83 , 33 , threatened to sue a garage owner in @entity149 , @entity150 , when she tripped over a kerb while investigating a burglary			1
she later dropped her claim .			0
