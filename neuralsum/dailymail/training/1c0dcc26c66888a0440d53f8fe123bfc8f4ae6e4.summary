tycoon blast : the new online game sets out to kill billionaire steel magnate @entity2 a video game in which players try to ' kill ' @entity5 - based steel tycoon @entity2 has been released in @entity6			1
in the online game , players hurl barrels and rocks at police outside the loss - making steel blast furnaces in @entity13 , eastern @entity6 , which the @entity15 tycoon closed down			1
the @entity15 billionaire himself appears in the futuristic game as a robot who must be bludgeoned to death			0
a text on the screen reads : ‘ the year is 2030			0
@entity24 has closed the majority of steel factories worldwide , tossing out thousands of steelworkers			1
‘ for these men tired of unfulfilled promises and repeated closures , when all mediation has failed , there is just one solution : kill @entity2			0
’ once the @entity24 robot is defeated , however , the game finally reminds the player that although @entity2 has been killed , he will quickly be replaced by someone similar			1
the game 's creator @entity38 has insisted it is simply a ' bit of fun ' and not meant to incite violence , adding : ‘ the @entity13 protests just had the right ingredients of heroes and baddies to make a good game			0
’ the @entity24 row began in december when the boss of the @entity24 steel conglomerate announced he was axing 630 jobs at the @entity13 plant , blaming lack of demand from the vehicle industry			1
when president @entity57 threatened to nationalise the factory , mr @entity2 called his bluff by threatening to close down all his operations in @entity6 , where his company employs 20,000 people			1
a deal was finally struck where mr @entity2 could close down two blast furnaces in @entity13 as long as he promised to find new jobs for the redundant workers			0
but it ended with @entity6 's industry minister @entity69 annoucing on live tv : ‘ i have to tell you that @entity2 is using blackmail and lies			1
quite simply , we do n't want him in @entity6 anymore			2
’ critics have condemned the new video game , which can be found at @entity75 , as glorifying the militancy of @entity6 unions - which many blame for the decline of the country 's once mighty industrial sector			1
@entity6 daily @entity82 said : ‘ it is hardly in the spirit of flexible unions that work with management to keep their factories open			2
’ retaliation : the game , which sees players attack police at the recently closed steel blast furnaces in @entity13 , eastern @entity6 , has been viewed as a result of mr @entity95 's decision to close the plant socialist president @entity57 pledged when he took office a year ago to revive @entity6 's ailing industrial base - but the latest figures show the country 's economy had no growth in 2012 and shrank by 0.8 per cent in the first three months of 2013			1
unemployment is already at a 30 - year high of 10.5 per cent and forecast to rise to 11.6 per cent next year			0
and with mr @entity57 's popularity now at 25 per cent - the lowest of any @entity108 leader in 50 years - the chief economist at @entity6 's @entity111 insurance group @entity112 has compared his predicament to that of @entity115 when she meets the @entity117 down a rabbit hole			2
in the book , the @entity117 tells @entity115 : ‘ my dear , here we must run as fast as we can , just to stay in place			0
and if you wish to go anywhere , you must run twice as fast as that			0
’ mr @entity112 added : ‘ the situation is much worse in @entity6 in the past year			2
@entity127 and @entity128 are implementing reforms			0
‘ so it is getting closer to the periphery of weaker @entity134 nations			0
what the queen said to @entity115 applies to @entity6			2
