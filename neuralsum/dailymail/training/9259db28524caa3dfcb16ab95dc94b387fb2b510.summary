by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:54 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:06 est , 28 december 2013 an @entity4 ship has taken over the efforts to save a tourist ship submerged in @entity8 ice since christmas day after a top - of - the - range @entity10 icebreaker got stuck en - route			1
the @entity13 , or @entity14 , was six nautical miles away from the stranded @entity16 ship when it too became trapped before eventually turning back to open water			1
but there are fears even the second boat will not be able to break through the four - metre - thick ice packs			1
but on wednesday morning , the boat hit a mass of thick ice sheets and today remains at a stand still			1
now , @entity4 's @entity42 , a back up ship carrying extra food and supplies , has been forced to take on the mission breaking through snow and ice in the @entity49 , eastern @entity8			1
it hopes to arrive on sunday			2
the captain of the @entity52 , @entity53 , said his ship - which can cut through ice up to 1.35 metres thick or reverse and ram thicker ice to break it up - was always ' option b '			2
' we were always going to be sent on until the end , ' he told a @entity61 reporter onboard his ship			2
however , he admitted the ship was not built to take on ice thicker than three metres			2
@entity16 's @entity32 is recreating @entity35 's 100 - year - old @entity34 expedition using new tools blizzards could hamper the rescue mission , but the ship is well - stocked and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them he said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be ' like driving your car into a brick wall '			1
just before 5am on wednesday , @entity4 deployed a @entity76 to free the group into open water , the @entity79 reported , but capt. @entity80 has now said it may need another two icebreakers to help it get to the stranded ship			1
@entity86 vessel @entity84 has also been sent out for back up , alongside @entity4 's @entity42 , which is carrying food and first aid professionals			1
after two days being stranded , passengers hoped to be rescued by the @entity14 as it powered through horrific conditions			2
but yesterday the heavy winds became too great , and built up an impenetrable pile of snow			0
@entity32 , an ice - strengthened ship built in 1982 , was originally used for oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a passenger vessel in the @entity97 and @entity8			2
marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity102 - the capital of the @entity4 state of @entity101 - the thick ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind			1
the ship had been on a multi-day tour from @entity107 to visit several sites along the edge of @entity8 before getting trapped in sea ice @entity86 's @entity111 and @entity4 's @entity42 have also been deployed to save the ship bleak : the ship has been stranded in the barren , frozen landscape since @entity115 on board are scientists from the @entity118 , a journalist from @entity29 and dozens of tourists who have paid to be part of the recreation of @entity124 € ™ s expedition			1
the research team has made contact with local stations from the @entity49 to say they are well - stocked with food			0
' we all know that there 's a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted sit and wait , ' said @entity134 , a passenger onboard the @entity135 , speaking via satellite phone			0
' i think people are just looking at that next step when that second icebreaker arrives			0
' we really are just hoping that the two powerful icebreaker ships will provide the breakage of ice that we need			0
' however , he said the ice floes appear to have built up dramatically overnight			0
they are also continuing their research while stranded by testing the temperature of the surrounding ice sheets			0
a spokesman for @entity4 's @entity151 told @entity4 's @entity152 : ' it is quite a remote part of the world , but we have everyone safe			1
the vessel is n't in any immediate danger			0
' the spokesman said the ship was visiting a number of sites along the edge of @entity8			0
the nationalities of the tourists have not been revealed , but they are known to include scientists and explorers			0
one has managed to send a tweet			0
@entity169 , of the @entity170 , wrote : ' heavy ice			0

team of researchers , tourists and a reporter stuck among thick ice sheet 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity102 , the @entity101 capital
called for help at 5am @entity115 morning after becoming submerged in ice
scientists warn blizzards could delay rescue mission further
@entity10 's ' @entity14 ' *neared* the vessel yesterday but at just six nautical miles away it was forced to *retreat* into open water
@entity4 's back - up ship , @entity42 , hopes to arrive on sunday
