by @entity0 published : 10:24 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 17:38 est , 6 september 2013 it has been over four decades since @entity2 left the moon , but now the space agency is at it again			1
@entity2 is launching a small rocket to investigate an unusual discovery made by the crew on @entity9 – moon dust			1
crews reported seeing an odd glow on the lunar horizon just before sunrise , an unexpected sight as the airless moon lacked atmosphere for reflecting sunlight			0
sky high : an artist 's concept showing the @entity22 - @entity22 - which will take off from a @entity2 base on friday scientists began to suspect that dust from the lunar surface was being electrically charged and somehow lofted off the ground , a theory that will be tested by the @entity2 ’s upcoming @entity22 and @entity29 – @entity22			1
the spacecraft is scheduled for lift off late friday night local time , from @entity2 's @entity33 on @entity34 , @entity35			1
‘ terrestrial dust is like talcum powder			0
on the moon , it 's very rough			0
it 's kind of evil			0
it follows electric field lines , it works its way in equipment			0
‘ it 's a very difficult environment to deal with , ’ said @entity22 project manager @entity43 of @entity2 's @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46			1
mystery light : these photographs from the moon 's surface just before sunrise are the origin of the moon dust mystery the @entity22 craft will circulate the moon 20 - 50 kilometres above its surface and analyse the lunar dust the origins of the lunar glow , comes from a @entity2 report from 1974 entitled ' evidence for a high altitude distribution of lunar dust ' which exhibits @entity65 17 commander @entity67 's sketches as he describes a unusual ' glow ' as @entity9 approached the orbital sunrise			1
during the 1972 mission , astronaut @entity67 drew what he saw on a note pad , describing the event in words as a light that ‘ came from non existense [ sic ] to subtle in nature then just before sunrise quickly sharp ’ @entity65 17 , launched in december 1972 , was final moon landing carried out by @entity2 under the @entity65 programme			2
@entity80 and his two crew members spent three days on the lunar surface , before returning to earth			0
at last year ’s 40th anniversary of their trip to the moon , @entity67 – to this day the last human to walk the moon – admitted he left his camera on its surface			0
‘ i left my camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith , the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass , ’ he said at the time of the anniversary			0
@entity67 , now 79 , did not think his would be the last footprints on the moon , but due to @entity2 cutbacks , the @entity65 programme was closed before another manned mission was made			2
however , as there is no wind on the moon to lift the dust , scientists believe solar radiation could leave the particles electronically charged during the day , and once colliding with negative particles , the dust particles repel each other , ‘ like strands of hair rubbed by a balloon , ’ @entity116 reported			2
in addition to studying fly - away lunar dust , @entity22 will probe the tenuous envelope of gases that surrounds the moon , a veneer so thin it stretches the meaning of the word ‘ atmosphere			1
’ instead , scientists refer to these environments as exospheres and hope that understanding the moon 's gaseous shell will shed light on similar pockets around @entity136 , asteroids and other airless bodies			0
‘ ladee is part of a much broader scientific exploration of the solar system , ’ said @entity139 , @entity2 's associate administrator for science			2
the $ 280 million mission also includes an experimental laser optical communications system that @entity2 hopes to incorporate into future planetary probes , including a @entity148 rover scheduled for launch in 2020			1
the prototype is based on technology used in terrestrial fiber - optic communications systems , such as @entity154 's fios			0
@entity2 says the system should be at least six times faster than conventional radio communications			2
also , its transmitters and receivers weigh half as much as similar radio communications equipment and use 25 per cent less power			0
ready for take off : a @entity163 launch vehicle is erected on the pad at @entity2 's @entity33 in @entity35 during a pathfinder exercise ahead of tomorrow 's launch lads and @entity22 : engineers at @entity2 's @entity44 prepare @entity22 ahead of its journey to analyse the possible ' moon dust ' mystery from 40 years ago inspector gadget : the spacecraft has been designed to study the moon 's exosphere and lunar dust environment and hopefully solve the mystery of the sunrise ' glow ' @entity180 - ard : the final preparations and close - outs are underway for friday 's launch , including testing all the equipment ‘ on the @entity186 , we 've been using laser communication and fiber optics to power our @entity189 and everything else for the last couple of decades , ’ @entity139 said			1
‘ @entity2 has really been wanting to make that same technological leap and put it into space			2
this is our chance to do that			0
’ @entity22 's optical communications system , which includes three ground stations in addition to @entity22 , will be tested before the probe drops into a low lunar orbit to begin its science mission about 60 days after launch			1
just getting to the moon will take @entity22 30 days - 10 times longer than the @entity65 missions due to the probe 's relatively low - powered @entity163 launcher			1
the rocket is comprised of three refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile motors and two commercially provided boosters			0
the minotaur 5 configuration will be flying for the first time with @entity22			2
the use of decommissioned missile components drove the decision to fly from @entity2 's @entity34 facility , one of only a few launch sites permitted to fly refurbished icbms under @entity221 - @entity220 arms control agreements .			1
