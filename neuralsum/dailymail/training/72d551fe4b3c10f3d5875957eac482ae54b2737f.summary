by @entity0 published : 17:31 est , 8 september 2012 updated : 17:19 est , 9 september 2012 damning : professor @entity1 co-authored the report which suggests we should stop complaining so much an @entity5 - style compensation culture is bleeding the @entity6 and schools dry , a leading academic warns today			1
some teachers have become so scared of litigation that class ‘ trips ’ consist of simply taking pupils out into their own playgrounds , says professor @entity1			1
his devastating analysis blames a toxic combination of ambulance - chasing lawyers and growing damages claims which are costing taxpayers billions			2
doctors and teachers are routinely expected to ‘ tick boxes ’ to follow health and safety rules even at the expense of what is actually best for patients and pupils , he argues			1
this has led to excessive risk - aversion in schools , which ban playground games or restrict school trips , claims prof @entity1 , emeritus professor of sociology at the @entity35			2
settlements include £ 3,000 for a pupil suffering cuts from rose bushes and £ 30,000 for a pupil injured falling off a bench			0
risky ? the complaints culture in @entity43 is making teachers so scared of litigation that they take school trips in the playground however , some teachers are also cashing in by taking legal action themselves , he adds in his book @entity52			1
around £ 6.7million was paid out by councils in 2010 to employees who sued over injuries picked up at work , says prof @entity1 , whose work was commissioned by the @entity59 think - tank			0
he adds that compensation demands were no longer seen as selfish acts by ‘ have - a - go ’ parents but as responsible action to stop other children having similar accidents			0
he says claims against the @entity6 are rising , along with defensive practices aimed at avoiding litigation			1
claims were ‘ perceived not only as a commonsense way of gaining financial compensation , but as a way of holding public services to account ’ , he says , adding : ‘ but the combination of an engrained compensation culture and litigation avoidance is bleeding health and education dry : both financially , and in terms of their public sector ethos and professional role			1
’ report claims that the complaints culture is costing our hospitals and schools in the long run the @entity89 estimates the cost of potential negligence claims at £ 16.6billion			1
however , of the 63,800 claims for medical negligence made since 2001 , only about 2,000 have had damages set by a court			2
another 28,700 were settled out of court			0
‘ suing a publicly funded institution such as the @entity6 amounts to a spectacular own goal for citizens , ’ said prof @entity1			1
‘ the fear of litigation erodes professional autonomy , stifles innovation , leads to defensive practices and encourages bureaucracy			0
‘ if we want to put a brake on the culture of litigation and litigation avoidance in @entity43 , we need to look beyond ambulance - chasers and greedy lawyers to the cultural conditions that have allowed litigious sentiments to flourish as common sense			0
’ @entity116 , director of the @entity59 , believes professionals are n't always offering what 's best for their pupils or patients @entity116 , director of the @entity59 , said ‘ this rise in the compensation culture has huge – if largely hidden – costs			0
in particular , it has created a climate in which professionals will prioritise litigation avoidance above what is best for their pupils or patients			0
‘ so many schools have reduced the extra-curricular activities that enrich children ’s experience while at school , from school trips to outdoor play , while doctors are incentivised to follow “ best practice ” rather than follow their professional judgment			2
