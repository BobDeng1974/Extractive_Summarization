the unemployed should be forced to take a job after no more than two years on the dole to end stop them spending a ' lifetime on benefits ' , @entity0 will say today			1
@entity6 is challenging @entity7 to back @entity0 's plan for a jobs guarantee to limit @entity10 to a year for under 25s and two years for older workers			1
in a letter to the prime minister , the shadow work and pensions secretary warned the country can not afford leaving people ' stuck on benefits for years on end '			1
however , there are 133,200 people aged 25 and over who have been claiming @entity10 for two years or more , and 30,000 people aged 18 - 24 have been on @entity10 for over a year			1
under @entity0 's plan , the government would force those on the scheme to take a job working 25 hours a week , paid at the minimum wage , for six months			1
the party hopes that four in five people would be kept on by employers in the job after six months			0
it would be paid for using £ 1.9billion raised through a levy on bankers ' bonuses , although the @entity43 claim it would cost £ 2.5billion			1
there are 133,200 people aged 25 and over who have been claiming @entity10 for two years or more , and 30,000 people aged 18 - 24 have been on @entity10 for over a year mps will debate and vote on the proposal in a debate in the @entity49 today			1
in a letter sent to mr @entity7 , seen by @entity51 , miss @entity6 calls on the government to back the idea			0
she writes : ' abandoning people to a lifetime on benefits is not only bad for individuals and their families , but bad for the economy , and bad for the taxpayer who foots the bill			0
' with youth unemployment up over the past quarter , the need to tackle this issue and get people off benefits and into work is even more urgent			0
' she tells mr @entity7 : ' it 's time to put an end to your government 's rules which allow jobseekers to spend a lifetime on benefits without being offered a day 's paid work			1
' she says the figures show that the number of over- 25s on benefits for more than two years has risen by 224 per cent since 2010			2
' by a one - off repeat of the tax on banker 's bonuses and restricting pension tax relief on incomes over £ 150,000 , the government could fully fund a @entity88 to ensure that anyone 25 and over receiving @entity10 for two years and over , and anyone under 25 who has been receiving @entity10 for over a year , would be offered a paid job that they will have to take or face losing benefits			1
' this is a tough but fair contract , because as a country we simply can not afford to continue wasting the potential of so many , leaving them stuck on benefits for years on end			0
' but a @entity102 source said : ' @entity0 's sums do n't add up			2
they are proposing yet more unfunded spending , meaning more borrowing and more taxes to pay for it			0
and @entity0 's bank tax is a short - term political gimmick that they want to spend at least ten times over			2
' it 's the same old @entity0			2
@entity113 has no economic plan			0
@entity0 would put the recovery at risk , put jobs at risk and hardworking people would pay the price with a less secure future			2
' @entity102 leader @entity7 has promised to end jobless benefits for the under - 21 as part of an ambition for full employment mr @entity7 has set out a @entity102 ambition for ' full employment ' , claiming it means ' more of our fellow men and women with the security of a regular wage ; it means you , your family and your children having a job and getting on in life '			2
the @entity102 have committed to banning under - 21s from claiming benefits , with requirement that they are ' earning or learning '			0
' no longer will you have the option of leaving school and going straight into a life on benefits ' , mr @entity7 said last year			0
in her letter to mr @entity7 , ms @entity6 says : ' you recently set out your aim for @entity149 to become a nation of ' full employment ' , but despite recent welcome falls in overall unemployment the number of people out of work ( 25 and over ) and claiming benefits for over two years is 224 per cent higher than in 2010			0
' i hope you will therefore support @entity0 and back a @entity88			0
it 's time to put an end to your government 's rules which allow jobseekers to spend a lifetime on benefits without being offered a day 's paid work			1
