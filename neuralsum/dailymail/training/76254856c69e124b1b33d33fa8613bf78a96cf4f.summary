' the world record is 350 - 0 so we ’re not there yet			1
' @entity9 is 120 miles from @entity31 and it takes three and a half hours to get there			2
' a lot of the lads are self - employed or work in the morning , pre-match			2
' so more than half of our team can miss away matches			0
' on this occasion we only had five senior players and the rest were 18 - year - old youth players			2
' in the first 10 minutes , every time they came forward they had two players overlapping one of ours			0
' the writing was on the wall			0

' @entity9 vice chairman @entity67 said : ' it was a staggering result and our boys played exceptionally well - i think it ’s a record scoreline			1
' in 2009 , @entity75 club @entity73 thought they had earned a place in rugby union ’s record books when they recorded a 194 - 3 win over @entity82			1
but the scoreline , a record winning margin for an @entity87 league game , has been wiped from the records after a ruling from local officials said @entity82 who had only eight players - fell foul of the laws that insist scrums have a minimum of five players per side			1
