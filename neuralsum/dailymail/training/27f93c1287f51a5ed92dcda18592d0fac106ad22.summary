just days before @entity0 celebrated his 27th birthday his whole life was turned upside down just days before @entity0 celebrated his 27th birthday his whole life was turned upside down			2
diagnosed with adult - onset type 1 diabetes , @entity4 contestant thought life would never be the same as he tried to process the shocking news given to him by his local doctor in @entity10 nearly a year and a half ago			1
rather than letting the diagnosis bring him down , @entity0 , who is now 28 , vowed to take a positive approach and has committed himself to educating others on the condition			1
' there are a lot of worse things that could have happened and i am lucky to have been diagnosed later in life , ' @entity0 told @entity21			2
but that was not the @entity10 plumber 's initial reaction to his life - threatening condition			0
having never known anyone with diabetes and having no awareness of the condition , it took five weeks before @entity0 took warning signs seriously			1
' at the start it was very gradual ' , he said			0
' i was very thirsty and it got worse and worse until it was unquenchable			2
' i was urinating quite a lot because it was my body 's way of releasing my high blood sugar - i was drinking litres of water every 10 minutes			1
' by the time @entity0 went to the doctor his blood sugar levels were at 35 , when recommended blood sugar levels are generally between four and eight			1
' the doctor told me i made it just in time ' , @entity0 said			2
' in a few more weeks it could have been really serious			0
' luckily there was no damage to my kidneys and eyes '			0
type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas stops making insulin , preventing the body from turning sugar into energy			1
if sufferers do not treat themselves with daily injections of insulin , the condition could potentially be life threatening			0
unlike type 2 diabetes , @entity0 's condition has no cause but can often be linked to family history			1
@entity0 with fellow contestant @entity67 ( left ) from @entity68 in 2013 when @entity0 , 28 , was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes he thought he would never be able to do the things he loved again , like eating a burger or drinking a beer when @entity0 first discovered he had type 1 diabetes he was in complete shock - diabetes did not run in his family			1
' i asked the doctor , " how do i get rid of it ? " - i was n't aware of what diabetes was , i did n't know anything about it			0
@entity0 and his wife @entity82 were both contestants on @entity85 's reality show , @entity4 , in 2011 and 2013 ' they said , " you ca n't get rid of it , you 'll have it the rest of your life "			0
' it was hard for me , i was thinking , " can i ever do the things i love again ? "			0
' playing sport , drinking beer or even going for a burger - all the things i thought i could never do because i had no information about diabetes			0
' although there is no cure for type 1 diabetes , @entity0 discovered it is very manageable			1
through maintaining a healthy lifestyle , regularly testing his blood glucose levels and injecting himself with insulin , @entity0 describes living a life that is close to ' normal '			1
' i now have to have about five to six injections a day - i 'm not a huge fan of needles but after a year and a half i have become used to it			0
' to be honest , nothing has changed but i am a bit more cautious , ' he said			0
' if i am going down the street i need to make sure i have lollies on me - if i do n't i am always freaking out - i am worried my blood sugar is going to drop and i will black out			1
' i also dj on the side and in front of hundreds of people i worry about that			0
' if anything having diabetes has pushed me to do more exercise , travel more and enjoy life			0
' @entity0 said he considers himself fortunate when compared to the ' five - year - old - boys who are woken up by their mothers in the middle of the night for insulin shots because they are too young to tackle it alone			1
' the @entity133 star puts his strength down to the support of his wife @entity82 and his mum , who has @entity139 alerts for diabetes on her phone			2
most weekends @entity0 and @entity82 , who appeared on @entity4 in 2011 and 2013 , stay active by walking into @entity10 's city , rather than driving their car			0
' i am also really lucky to be a plumber because it keeps me active and i am able to have regular and organised meals			0
the @entity133 star puts his strength down to the support of his wife @entity82 @entity0 , who is a plumber in @entity10 , @entity118 's on the side			1
he said he always has to have lollies on him because he is afraid his blood sugar levels will drop and he will black out through maintaining a healthy lifestyle , regularly testing his blood glucose levels and injecting himself with insulin , @entity0 describes living a life that is close to ' normal ' @entity0 walks his little dogs everyday to stay active , whether its going for a run around the block or taking them to the park close by ' i try to ride my bike or walk to work as much as i can and i also have little dogs so if i am sitting on the couch they always make me feel guilty , ' he said			1

' i think it is a good idea to plant the seed that people do n't have drive to work all the time or even for them to just learn to get off one train stop earlier			0
' even though i ride to work and it is a lot quicker , when i walk i can actually enjoy my time , unwind and see people , rather than just staring at your phone on the train			0
' @entity0 hopes this campaign can help spread awareness across @entity187 and raise money to help find a cure			0
' ideally it would be great to find a cure , but for now i just want people to know how deadly it can be and how important it is to stay active and healthy , ' @entity0 said			2
