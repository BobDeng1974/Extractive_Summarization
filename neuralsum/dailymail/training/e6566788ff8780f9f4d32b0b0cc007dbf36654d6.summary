by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 13:59 est , 10 december 2012 multi-generational households are becoming increasingly popular in @entity2 , with almost 36 million over- 18s having lived in a house containing two or three generations of adults , according to a recent report by insurance company @entity7			1
but the @entity9 family has gone one step further			1
they are one of the few four - generational – or @entity13 – households in the country			2
@entity9 and his wife @entity16 live in @entity17 , a seven - bedroom property in @entity19 , outside @entity20 in @entity21 , with @entity16 ’s mother , @entity23 , @entity9 ’s son @entity24 and wife @entity25 , and her son @entity26 , 12 , and @entity24 ’s two sons , @entity28 , 14 , and @entity29 , eight			1
under one roof : @entity9 , left , and wife @entity16 , far right , lives with her mother @entity31 , @entity9 's son @entity24 , and grandsons @entity28 , 14 , and eight - year - old @entity29 the house is split down the middle , with @entity24 ’s family on one side and @entity9 and @entity16 on the other , while @entity31 lives in a separate annexe			1
‘ you grow far more living together as one family , ’ says @entity9 , 65 , who co-owns the property with @entity24 , 38			1
‘ you can do much more with the rest of the family than on your own			1
’ @entity31 , 77 , says : ‘ it works out very well for all of us			2
i look after the dogs during the day and keep things tidy and because i know when everyone ’s coming home i can put something in the oven ready for when they get back			2
’ sixteen years ago , @entity16 , an admin manager , and @entity9 , a computer engineer , asked @entity31 to move in with them in a house in @entity58 , @entity59			1
the set - up proved a success but the area was less than ideal for them and they decided to make a move to @entity21 to be closer to @entity9 ’s children and grandchildren			1
@entity13 home : the family all live together in @entity70 , a seven - bedroom property outside @entity20 , @entity21 personal space : a bedroom in the west wing of the house , where @entity9 and @entity16 lives ‘ property prices were astronomical , ’ recalls @entity9			1
‘ so we suggested to @entity24 that we consider pooling our finances and buying one big house , and he said yes			2
’ the hunt began for a property big enough to accommodate eight of them			2
the @entity17 was the answer to their dreams – or at least had the potential to be			2
the red - brick property , built in 1850 and a former borstal , had lain derelict for years			0
but set in rolling countryside perfect for walking the family ’s five border collies and with easy access to @entity93 , where @entity24 ’s business is based , it seemed perfect			1
they bought the house for £ 550,000 and spent £ 300,000 renovating it and adding an extension			0
the goal was to create two separate homes under one roof			0
the more traditional ‘ west wing ’ , with its exposed beams , oak floors , rugs and large , cosy drawing room with wood - burning stove , belongs to @entity9 and @entity16			1
homely : a bathroom in @entity70 which is on the market for £ 950,000 the first floor , which in the borstal days was divided into tiny ‘ cells ’ for offenders , now has two guest bedrooms			0
the second floor – formerly empty roof space accessed via a trap door – contains a light - filled master suite , with bathroom and storage room that could be converted into a nursery			0
the ‘ east wing ’ – which has its own front door but can be accessed through a connecting door on the first floor – is occupied by @entity24 , @entity25 and the children			0
it has a younger feel , with underfloor heating , modern colours and a new kitchen with central island			0
the @entity17 offers slightly more than 4,000 sq ft of living space			0
‘ we can all disappear , ’ says @entity132 ‘ there are enough bathrooms , so there ’s no need to queue in the morning			0
it ’s big enough not to step on one another ’s toes			0
it ’s been wonderful , as i would have been lonely living alone			0
of agents @entity143 & staff , says : ‘ it is rare to find four generations living together – and unusual to find a property that lends itself to four generations so well			2
’ the @entity151 ’ arrangement is coming to an end because @entity24 wants his own place , but @entity9 , @entity16 and @entity31 hope to find somewhere to live in the same area			1
the house is on the market at £ 950,000			0
