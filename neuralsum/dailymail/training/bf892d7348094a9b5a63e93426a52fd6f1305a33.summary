by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 6 november 2013 a ten - year - old boy has been given a new ear by doctors who built the organ from scratch using one of his ribs			1
@entity8 was born with an ear lobe but no ear structure or canal on his left side			1
this was due to him suffering hemifacial microsomia - a congenital disorder that affects the development of the lower half of the face , most commonly the ears and mouth			1
@entity8 , 10 , was given a new left ear ( pictured ) by surgeons at @entity23 who made it out of one of his ribs			1
they used skin grafts to cover the new ear structure it can occur on just one side of the face or one both and can cause problems with breathing			1
it is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts			0
now , surgeons at @entity23 have built @entity8 a brand new ear			1
his mother , @entity41 , 41 , said the amazing procedure has transformed her son ’s life			0
she said : ‘ @entity8 has been so brave , and we ’re so proud of him			2
the new ear means that @entity8 wo n’t have to deal with people staring any more			1
@entity8 was born with hemifacial microsomia - a congenital disorder that affects the development of the lower half of the face			1
it meant he had a left ear lobe but no outer ear or ear canal ' he has coped with people making comments about his appearance all his life			1
ever since he was small he hid behind our legs when he met new people , and always hid his left side			1
‘ when he was three , a group of older boys surrounded us while we were on a train and pointed and laughed at him			0
‘ even though he was very young , the experience affected @entity8 for years afterwards , it was deeply traumatic and really set his confidence back a long way			2
‘ when @entity8 was five , a girl told him his appearance made her feel sick			2
those are the sorts of reactions that he had to get used to			0
he had to do a lot of growing up in a short space of time			0
@entity8 ( pictured as a baby ) was told he had to wait until he was nine - years - old before he could have the procedure as his ribs needed to mature sufficiently @entity8 's mother , @entity41 ( pictured with @entity8 and his brothers , @entity84 and @entity85 ) , said : ' @entity8 has been so brave , and we 're so proud of him			1
the new ear means that @entity8 wo n't have to deal with people staring any more ' mrs @entity89 , a childminder , and her husband @entity91 , 40 , a business development manager , were keen to give @entity8 the power to decide the course of his life - changing treatment			1
doctors had advised the family , of @entity97 , @entity98 , that @entity8 needed to wait until he was nine - years - old before they could operate to allow enough time for his ribcage to develop			2
‘ some people with @entity8 ’s condition choose not to have reconstructive surgery			2
the staff at @entity23 said our options were to do nothing , to fit a prosthetic or to have a rib graft			0
@entity8 was too scared to look at his new ear until he was in the car going home from the hospital he had to have a skin graft taken from his head ( pictured ) to cover and support the new ear ‘ i was keen that @entity8 was able to make the decision himself			1
@entity91 and i encouraged him to speak to consultants directly during appointments , as if he was one of the adults			0
’ in april 2011 , @entity8 decided that he wanted to go ahead with the rib graft procedure which would involve two operations			2
the first operation , which involved putting the newly shaped rib bone into place , was carried out a year later			0
the procedure involved a section of bone and cartilage from one of @entity8 ’s ribs being used to build the missing ear structure			1
skin grafts were then applied to cover the bone			1
@entity8 was so happy when he first saw his new ear that he took a photo of it on his phone and sent it to all of his friends and family @entity8 has been deaf on his left side since birth and although the new ear does not allow him to hear , he will have the option to implant a hearing aid later in life			1
then , in march 2013 , the final procedure to fill out the ear structure using skin grafts was successfully completed			1
mrs @entity89 said : ‘ when they took the bandage off , @entity8 was so nervous that he did n’t want to look at the left side of his face at first			1
‘ it was only when we were in the car going home from the hospital that he felt brave enough to take a picture of his new ear and look at it			0
‘ he was so happy when he saw what it looked like - he sent pictures to everyone to show off			0
’ it is possible that @entity8 will require further surgery in the future to correct the alignment of his jaw and teeth			0
it is possible that @entity8 ( pictured with his new ear ) will require further surgery in the future to correct the alignment of his jaw and teeth mr and mrs @entity89 have been given support throughout @entity8 ’s journey by charities @entity177 and @entity178			2
@entity8 ’s brothers , five - year - old @entity84 , and @entity85 , nine , have been drafted in to look out for their big brother through the lengthy healing process			2
mrs @entity89 said : ‘ we had to explain to the boys that they need to be careful during rough - and - tumble games			0
if @entity8 damages his ear there could be an infection or it might need to be rebuilt , so we have to be careful			2
‘ he ’s also had to sit out of @entity190 at school , but he ’s been very understanding about the situation			0

children with the condition have a small or underdeveloped part of the face - usually the ear or jaw			2
