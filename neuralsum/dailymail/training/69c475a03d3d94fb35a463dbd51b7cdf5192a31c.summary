many of his images became well - known symbols of the historic bombing - but others , taken on a faulty camera , have not been seen since			0

wasteland : a shrine sitting amidst the devastation in another photograph taken by propagandist @entity39 tenderness : a mother breastfeeds her baby , covered in debris after the @entity67 attack confiscated : this unidentified military policeman took the photo album to stop it being used as @entity8 propaganda an atomic bomb weighing more than 4,000kg was dropped on @entity4 by parachute from an @entity11 @entity73 at 11.02 local time on august 9 , 1945			1

it is expected to fetch £ 20,000 when it goes up for auction at @entity94 in @entity95 this week			1
@entity96 , a historian from the auction house , said : ' these photographs come from an album that was put together by an @entity11 military policeman who had been sent to police @entity102 after the end of @entity55 ' the policeman assembled around 250 photographs in the album during his time in @entity8 and most of them detail his life as a military policeman and around the city			1
' but among the photos are 24 that were taken by @entity39 , a @entity8 photographer whose images of the destruction to @entity4 became known worldwide			2
' the album contains some of @entity117 's most famous images but there are others in the set that have never been seen before			0
' it is thought these photos come from a second , faulty camera that @entity117 had with him			0
' these photographs started off life as propaganda against the @entity11 , who wanted very much to cover up what they had just done			1
' @entity129 was high and so the photos of the destruction were kept under shop counters and handed out surreptitiously			0
' at some point it seems the military policeman confiscated the photos from a @entity8 citizen in @entity102 and put them in his album with no knowledge of their importance			1
the dropping of the two atomic bombs was the most devastating action the world has ever seen			0
' these photos serve as a reminder of the power we hold that keeps the peace			0
