by @entity0 published : 10:05 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 10 may 2013 @entity1 wanted sir @entity2 to form a supergroup with him – and be its bass player			1
he sent a telegram inviting the @entity6 to join forces with him , jazz trumpeter @entity8 and drummer @entity9 in 1969 , as the @entity6 were breaking up			1
it read : ‘ we are recording and ( sic ) lp together this weekend			2
how about coming in to play bass ? ’ it was sent to @entity2 at @entity6 ’ @entity15 in @entity16 on october 21 , 1969 , and told him to get in touch with producer @entity18			1
@entity6 aide @entity19 replied on his behalf , telling @entity1 that @entity2 was on holiday in @entity22 and not due back for another two weeks			1
the telegram is on display at the @entity25 in @entity26			1
the telegraph reads : ' we are recording and lp together this weekend , " it says , complete with a typographical error			2
" how about coming in to play bass stop call @entity18 212 - 5812212			2
peace @entity1 @entity8 @entity9 ' vacation : beatle aide @entity19 replied on @entity2 's behalf , telling @entity1 the following day that @entity2 was on vacation and not expected back for another two weeks but less attention has been paid to the bass player they were trying to recruit			1
this tantalizing detail about the super group that never was - jazz standout @entity9 would have been on drums - is contained in an oft - overlooked telegram that @entity1 sent to @entity2 at @entity6 ' @entity15 in @entity16 on oct. 21 , 1969			1
' we are recording and lp together this weekend , ' it says , complete with a typographical error			2
' how about coming in to play bass stop call @entity18 212 - 5812212			2
' the telegram , advising @entity2 to contact producer @entity18 if he could make the session , has been part of the @entity25 memorabilia collection since it was purchased at auction in 1995			1
still it has only generated attention in recent months with the successful release of ' @entity54 , ' expected to be the last cd of @entity1 's studio recordings			2
come to light : the telegram only generated attention in recent months with the successful release of ' @entity54 , ' expected to be the last cd of @entity1 's studio recordings the telegram advises @entity2 to contact a producer he could make the session with @entity8 , left , but @entity2 had gone his family to their farm in @entity22 to escape exposure to a rumour that he had died in a car crash and been replaced by a lookalike			1
' it 's not something you hear about a lot , ' @entity70 historian @entity69 said of the telegram , now displayed at the restaurant in @entity26			1
' @entity78 connoisseurs are aware of it			2
it would have been one of the most insane supergroups			0
these four cats certainly reinvented their instruments and the way they 're perceived			0
' @entity87 promoter and @entity1 fanatic @entity86 , who has researched the telegram , says it offers a glimpse of what might have been			2
' it 's amazing because of the names of the people , ' he said			0
' of course that did n't happen , but the telegram brings us something to dream about			2
this is a document , proof that they had an idea to do an album			0
' the telegram raises more questions than it answers			2
it 's not clear if @entity2 was even aware of the unusual , apparently impromptu invitation to rush from his @entity16 base to @entity110 for the planned session			1
beatle aide @entity19 replied on @entity2 's behalf , telling @entity1 the following day that @entity2 was on vacation and not expected back for another two weeks			1
the invitation came at an extremely awkward moment for the @entity6 ' bassist			0
it was sent the same day a prominent @entity110 radio station gave wide exposure to a rumor that @entity2 had died in a car crash and been replaced by a lookalike			1
the bizarre story , supposedly supported by hints on @entity6 records and album covers , briefly gained worldwide credibility			0
timing : the telegram came at a time when the @entity6 were falling apart due to business and artistic conflicts that likely would have been exacerbated by @entity2 appearing on a record with @entity1 and @entity8 its dark nature apparently prompted the exasperated @entity2 to retreat with his family to their farm in @entity22			1
it also came at a time when the @entity6 were falling apart due to business and artistic conflicts that likely would have been exacerbated by @entity2 appearing on a record with @entity1 and @entity8			1
@entity2 was also still bound by a songwriting partnership with @entity140 that might have further complicated the release of any @entity143 compositions			1
and then there is the question of what the proposed group would have sounded like			0
@entity8 was moving away from his jazz roots toward a fusion - based sound			0
he said in his autobiography that by 1968 he was listening primarily to @entity151 , @entity152 and , particularly , @entity1 - musicians joined by a love of syncopated funk not found on @entity6 ' tracks			0
it is not clear either how @entity2 's melodic , subtle bass playing would have made its presence felt in a band that included @entity1 ' guitar and @entity8 ' trumpet			1
' at first , though , it sounds really weird and off the wall			0
but on second thought it makes perfect , @entity1 - type sense to chuck in someone who 's a great musician but comes from a different tradition , ' said @entity1 biographer @entity171			0
' i regret this never actually took place			0
... it would have been magnificent			0
' @entity2 is the only one of the four musicians who is still alive			1
world tour : @entity2 's spokesman said the former @entity6 is too busy on his world tour to comb his memory for his thoughts about a telegram sent more than four decades ago his spokesman , @entity183 , said the former @entity6 is too busy on his world tour to comb his memory for his thoughts about a telegram sent more than four decades ago			1
in his autobiography , @entity8 said he and @entity1 occasionally jammed together at his apartment in @entity110 and tried to get into the studio to record but were hampered by financial matters and by their busy schedules			0
@entity171 and others maintain that @entity8 wanted $ 50,000 up front to attend the session			2
the @entity195 - trained trumpeter @entity8 described @entity1 , who learned his chops backing up the @entity197 and others , as a self - taught ' natural musician ' who could not read music but was able to pick up complicated pieces in the blink of an eye			0
@entity8 says in the book that he and arranger @entity205 were in @entity206 planning to record with @entity1 at the time of his death in @entity16			0
' what i did n't understand is why nobody told him not to mix alcohol and sleeping pills , ' @entity8 wrote			0
@entity1 's death dashed their plans to record together , with or without @entity2			1
@entity217 , the engineer who produced most of @entity1 's music , said there will always be speculation about what might have been			0
' i think it would have been phenomenal , ' @entity217 said			0
' lord knows where it may have gone ; those huge egos in the studio at the same time ! i would have loved to have done that one			0
but it was not to be			0

@entity231 advises @entity2 to make contact if he could make the session
but @entity2 had gone with his family to their farm in @entity22
