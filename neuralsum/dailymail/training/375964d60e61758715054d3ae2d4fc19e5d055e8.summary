published : 04:53 est , 8 march 2014 updated : 08:54 est , 8 march 2014 doctors treating @entity2 have told the @entity5 legend 's family that the chances of recovery are now so slim that only ' a miracle ' can save him			1
the 45 - year - old seven - time world champion has been in an artificially induced coma for 10 weeks since badly injuring his brain during a low - speed ski accident in the @entity13 on december 29			1
most artificial comas last for a period of two to three weeks			1
his management team , led by spokeswoman @entity18 , insist that he remains in the ' wake up ' phase of his treatment as doctors continue to decrease the powerful narcotics that have kept him unconscious			1
@entity24 : doctors have told the family of @entity2 ' only a miracle can save him ' official news about his condition is minimal : but sources close to the family say the prognosis for @entity2 could not be worse			1
' he is in terrible shape but until the family issue a statement we can not write about it , ' said one senior @entity41 journalist			2
' the family have , we are told , been informed that only a miracle can bring him back now			2
' however , @entity45 sports newspaper @entity44 is claiming that @entity2 is no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently			2
@entity47 reported a fortnight ago that the wake - up phase had been stopped due to complications and that he was placed back in the coma			1
that was denied by his agent @entity18 although experts say that such a super-fit individual as @entity2 would have expelled all the drugs from his body by now , and that if he was going to wake up , he would have done so already			1
this week was a vital one for schumacher - doctors were hoping for a sign that he was aware of his environment			1
@entity45 sports newspaper @entity44 is claiming that the seven - time world champion is no longer on a ventilator and is now breathing independently finish line : @entity2 took the chequered flag 91 times during a glittering career - the last one coming at the @entity69 in @entity70 in october 2006 listen up : @entity2 and @entity71 in the @entity72 pits ahead of the @entity45 @entity69 in 2008 they look for a fluttering of eyelids or a movement of fingers that is more than a reflex nerve twitch			2
' this has not happened , ' said another source close to the family			0
' on sunday his wife @entity82 spent her 45th birthday at his bedside with their children @entity85 and @entity88 , his brother @entity89 and his father @entity90			0
' they talked and talked and prayed for him to acknowledge their presence			0
but he remains comatose with tubes feeding him , supplying him with air , giving him medicine and removing waste from his body			2
' the doctors have given it to them straight			2
there is little hope left that he will come out of this			0
' miracles happen , of course , and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy			0
but all the money in the world can not fix what has happened to him			0
' three times daily @entity2 's joints and muscles are massaged to prevent atrophy and bed sores			0
hero : @entity2 , celebrating after the @entity125 , was worshiped during his time at @entity72 this week was a vital one for @entity2 ( pictured here in 2012 ) - two months into his coma , doctors were hoping for a sign that he was aware of his environment and he 's off : @entity2 made his @entity5 debut as a @entity134 driver at the @entity135 the coma suppressed his swallowing reflex , pain perception and his respiratory drive			1
he has to be acutely monitored around the clock during this wake - up phase to see if such things are returning naturally			1
experts say that perhaps the greatest risk of all facing @entity2 in his prone position is pneumonia			0
the lack of a competent swallowing mechanism can make saliva run into the lungs and trigger the potentially lethal respiratory infection			0
he has already had - and conquered - one lung infection			0
his blood is also thinned to prevent thrombosis and he is regularly turned and even stood straight up at times to keep it flowing			0
hobby : @entity2 , pictured here in 2005 , was injured in a skiing accident on december 29 rescue mission : @entity2 was taken to the @entity160 in @entity161 after his accident in the @entity13 on december 29 he lies on a special air - filled mattress to prevent pressure sores and his urinary tract is under constant vigilance because of the danger of waste bacteria entering the bloodstream and causing a potentially fatal infection			0
@entity171 , a former @entity5 doctor , wrote on sunday : ' the majority of the patients that come out alive from a coma after this amount of time suffer severe disabilities			1
' he and others say the supposed mouth movements that @entity2 's former team - mate @entity71 saw were probably nothing more than pure nerve reflexes that repeatedly occur in coma patients and not conscious movements			1
the beginning : @entity2 's first victory was in 1992 at the @entity187 @entity69 end of an era : @entity2 completed his final race at the @entity190 @entity69 in 2012			0
