by sir @entity0 published : 16:06 est , 6 october 2012 updated : 02:14 est , 8 october 2012 sir @entity0 , historian and former director of the @entity3 museum , says both the @entity4 and conservative parties are using ' one nation ' rhetoric but neither are suggesting ways out of the ' trashocracy ' mess the @entity11 must have had a rude awakening last tuesday			1
someone had not only got in through the back door but they raided the holy of holies			0
they made off with that jewel in the @entity21 crown , that vision which had carried the party to electoral victory for most of the last century – one - nation conservatism			1
what makes it worse is that @entity30 , in his landmark speech , had appropriated a mantle which @entity32 believed that he unassailably wore			1
alas , no longer ! the @entity36 leader , in words that should have been spoken by the present prime minister , gave vent to his passionate belief in a country in which ‘ patriotism , loyalty , dedication to the common cause courses through the veins of all , and nobody feels left out ’			0
@entity45 sprinkled with churchillian rhetoric , he reiterated the phrase ‘ one nation ’ 44 times , thus reducing the present @entity51 ’s @entity50 to something akin to an object of universal derision			0
we have not heard anything like this since some of @entity60 ’s star performances			0
readers might well ask what is the difference between ‘ one - nation socialism ’ and ‘ one - nation conservativism ’			1
what is it anyway ? one - nation conservatism was the invention of @entity69			1
it was a vision that successfully averted the country from the revolutions and class wars that were to engulf the @entity75 mainland			1
by the middle of the @entity80 period , the effect of the @entity77 had been to create not only a new , immensely rich middle class , but also a wretchedly paid working class , which lived in conditions that can only be described as shocking			1
by the late 1860s , working - class men had the vote and @entity69 realised that for the @entity11 to gain government , social reform must be carried through to gain their support			1
money talks : @entity91 's comic creation ' loadsamoney ' and a 1869 caricature of @entity69 in this way a line of descent was formed that enabled the @entity11 to accept the @entity97 as created after 1945 and support it until the dependency culture it created as its downside came under attack by @entity60			1
we now need to go back and ask ourselves : is the @entity103 of 2012 in any way similar to the country as it was in the 1840s and 1850s when @entity69 formulated his ‘ one nation ’ idea ? what shocked him most in that period was the utterly enormous gaps between the rich and the poor , the haves and the have - nots			1
as far as i have observed things in my lifetime , all that we have seen is one form of divided society replaced by another			1
the industrial revolution , which gave birth to cotton mill towns , such as @entity127 , near @entity128 , pictured , lay the foundations for a class - divided @entity103 cotton rooms at @entity131 @entity132 of @entity133 , fell silent after the industrial revolution but the class system by then was well and truly established what i am trying to argue is summed up in a comment i overheard one woman make to another at the @entity140 : ‘ do n’t worry , if you ’re short of staff i ’ll send some of mine over to help out			2
’ no , this was was n’t @entity144			0
but it is a vivid reflection of the society created as much by @entity4 as by the conservatives over the past 30 years			2
i do n’t think anyone would challenge the statement that the gulf between the rich and the poor must be as wide in 2012 as it was 1911			1
the old society that was – in effect , swept away that year with the passing of the @entity155 which curtailed the powers of the @entity157 – was built on a noblesse oblige between classes			2
neither @entity30 nor @entity32 has offered any vision to take us forward out of this mess there was the ladder of ascent – working class , lower - middle , middle - middle and upper - middle class , then gentry and then aristocracy			1
it was a society based on birth and bound by obligation but it was not immutable			2
people could and did ascend through achievement and education			0
you can see it in action in @entity182 , where everyone knows their place in a mechanism that by and large worked , although there could be dislocation			0
however , the option was always for evolution rather than revolution			0
having swept that away as feudal and undemocratic , a very different society was created by the final decades of the last century			2
its successor , which is everywhere around us , is a society no longer founded on lineage and brought up with the burden of obligation based on inherited @entity203 moral values , but one whose sole criterion is money and what it can buy			1
it has produced what long ago i labelled the new ‘ trashocracy ’			0
money as never before can buy social status , a title if you give enough away and positions on various boards			2
the first attribute to get anywhere these days is has whoever it is got money or , if not , does he or she know anyone who has any ? that was not true 40 years ago			2
everything is about money : how to make it , how to keep it , how to spend it and how to recruit people who can lay their hands on it			2
and so now we come back to @entity30 who , it was noticeable when asked whether or not he was a millionaire , was evasive			1
perhaps he too is among those he accused of getting @entity32 ’s £ 40,000 tax handout next april			1
@entity30 sees the country as being in a wartime crisis situation			1
but , alas , there ’s no @entity239 putting together ideas for a programme of the kind that framed the post-war @entity97			0
@entity30 ’s rhetoric was great but there was little , if any , substance			1
so how to create this ‘ one nation ’ ? there is no money and the country is still borrowing and running up debt at a furious rate			2
with devolution and adumbrated @entity254 devolution , the ‘ one nation ’ has already fragmented			0
money has meant that as soon as anyone has made any , the first thing they do is abandon the decaying organs of the post- 1945 state			2
they opt for private healthcare rather than the @entity263 and private education over the comprehensive system			0
they also buy themselves into the property ladder			0
this increasing gulf is rubbed into those less fortunate by the often thoughtless , extravagant and vulgar lifestyle of those who ’ve got it			0
and there ’s little if any sign there of the @entity80 fervour of do - gooding or any moral structure in a society that glorifies relativism and the me - me code of ethics			1
neither @entity30 nor @entity32 has offered any vision to take us forward out of this mess			1
the best that can be said is that things look a good deal worse on the @entity75 mainland			0
any solution , i need hardly write , is seen solely in terms of money			2
as @entity60 once said : ‘ you do n’t solve a problem by throwing money at it			0
’ the country ’s overall malaise goes much deeper , calling for what in times past used to be labelled a reform of society			0
the fact that we ca n’t even think in those terms any longer is an index of how far we ’ve slid downhill			0
it explains why often a younger generation finds any form of committed religious belief weird			0
years ago i recall that great man sir @entity312 saying to me : ‘ no great men any more			0
’ sadly , how true that is .			0

@entity69 's *original* vision relied on the rich looking out for the poor
that 's why @entity30 's attempt to recreate it in today 's *rapacious* society is ' doomed to *failure* '
neither @entity30 nor @entity32 have set out plans to shift away from this money - mad ' mess '
