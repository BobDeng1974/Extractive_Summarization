this is the picture which last night intensified pressure on the head of the government ’s child abuse inquiry to resign			1
it shows @entity6 with @entity7 , the wife of former home secretary @entity9 , at an awards ceremony in october 2013			2
this is despite mrs @entity6 telling mps that she had had no social contact with the @entity14 since april 2013			1
victims of sexual abuse , their lawyers and @entity12 last night called for mrs @entity6 to resign over her dinner - party links to @entity9 , who is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about allegations – which he denies – that he was at the centre of an @entity26 cover - up of sex abuse claims			1
@entity6 ( left ) was with @entity7 ( right ) at the 2013 @entity28 at @entity29 in october last year - alongside journalist @entity30 ( centre ) - but did not mention this meeting to mps there are calls for @entity6 to quit after she admitted she entertained former home secretary @entity9 and his wife three times at dinner parties at her house , and twice went to his central @entity40 home for dinner corporate lawyer @entity42 , who lives in the same @entity40 street as the @entity14 , wrote a letter to home secretary @entity45 , in which she claimed her last social contact with @entity7 had been in april 2013			1
mrs @entity6 , the lord mayor of london , boasted of having ‘ carefully checked through my records ’ to ensure she had not missed anything when she wrote to mrs may			1
and she told mps this week she had ‘ gone the extra distance ’ to produce an exhaustive list of contacts			2
last night a @entity57 source insisted it was a ‘ minor omission ’ , but @entity60 and @entity61 mps queued up to demand her resignation			2
critics said that , even if the mistake was an oversight , it did not bode well for the chairman of a sensitive inquiry to have such a flimsy grasp of the facts			0
as @entity71 and the @entity57 desperately tried to prop up their candidate : but the emergence of the picture was the most damaging revelation			0
it shows mrs @entity77 and @entity7 talking to former @entity78 newsreader @entity30 at the @entity28 in october 2013			0
all three were judges of the awards , which recognise @entity84 firms ’ contribution to the community			0
in her letter to mrs may , mrs @entity6 said : ‘ i have had no further social contact with @entity9 and @entity7 since april 23 , 2013 , and have not spoken to either of them in person or by telephone since , other than disclosed in this letter			1
’ she told the home secretary that she and @entity94 were ‘ both judges for the @entity28 in 2014 ’ , adding the extra detail that @entity94 did not attend the 2014 awards ceremony			0
but she makes absolutely no mention in her letter of the 2013 awards			0
then on tuesday this week , she offered additional reassurance to the @entity102 , telling its members : ‘ i have gone the extra distance to make sure i have dug out any possible connection			0
’ her assertion unravelled within 24 hours as the new photo emerged			0
home secretary @entity45 has insisted the inquiry can go ahead , despite the chairman 's links to @entity9 ( right , with his wife ) on tuesday , she offered additional reassurance to the home affairs select committee , saying : ‘ i have gone the extra distance to make sure i have dug out any possible connection			1
’ her assertion unravelled within 24 hours as the new photo emerged			0
last night committee chairman @entity114 said he was ‘ surprised ’ by the new information			0
he added : ‘ it is important to give her the opportunity , as i will do when i write to her , to ask her why this particular piece of information was missing			0
’ lord @entity9 is accused of burying a dossier given to him by mp @entity122 in 1983			2
it documented the alleged involvement of @entity126 figures in a child sex ring			2
he has denied the claims			0
these are the unanswered questions : in her letter to mrs may , mrs @entity6 made the damning admission that she had entertained the former home secretary and his wife three times at dinner parties at her house , and twice went to their home for dinner			1
but despite their social and professional contacts , she insisted she did not have a ‘ close association ’ with the peer			0
lord @entity9 is accused of ignoring , or burying , a dossier given to him by mp @entity122 in 1983 , allegedly documenting the involvement of vip figures in a child sex ring			1
mrs @entity6 made no further comment yesterday			2
a @entity57 spokesman said : ‘ @entity6 has written to the home secretary setting out any issues , including her involvement in the @entity28 , which might be seen to cast doubt on her impartiality			2
‘ the home secretary is confident that this panel , under the chairmanship of @entity159 , will carry out a robust and thorough inquiry , and will challenge institutions without fear or favour , in order to get to the bottom of this issue and stop it from happening again			2
’ but @entity60 mp @entity168 said : ‘ i just do n’t think at this stage it ’s viable that she ’s the person that leads this			1
’ asked if mrs @entity6 had the confidence of people involved in the inquiry , cabinet office minister @entity174 told the @entity78 : ‘ i think she will need to show that and time will tell			1
’ a lawyer representing victims said her social relationship with @entity9 put her ‘ beyond the pale in terms of her credibility ’			1
@entity187 said ‘ evidence of dinner parties with @entity9 really puts her beyond the pale in terms of her credibility with my clients ’			1
@entity61 mp @entity194 called on mrs @entity6 to stand down , calling her appointment a mistake			2
one of the two victims of abuse sitting on the panel , @entity200 , said the inquiry had got off to a ‘ very difficult start ’			1
the home secretary 's first choice to lead the inquiry into historic child abuse was @entity207 ( left ) , but she was forced to step down because her brother was the government 's attorney general			1
@entity60 mp @entity210 called for her to stand down has she misled @entity211 ? if mps conclude mrs @entity6 deliberately misled @entity211 – of which there is no evidence – she could be hauled back before them to correct what she said			1
under an antiquated procedure last used decades ago , she could theoretically be forced to come to the @entity217 to be admonished publicly by the speaker			0
it is known as being ‘ called to the bar of the @entity217 ’			0
the last time a @entity221 was summoned to the bar was on 24 january 1957			0
in addition , any mp can table a motion calling for the @entity217 to censure someone .			0
