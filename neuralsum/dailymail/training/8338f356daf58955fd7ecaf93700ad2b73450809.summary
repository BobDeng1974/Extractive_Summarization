@entity1 prop @entity0 is seeking an historic win over @entity3 to put on his cv before he hangs up his boots			1
the 34 - year - old is closer to the end of his career than the beginning and knows all too well that the @entity3 have never lost to the @entity10 in 29 meetings since their first clash in 1905 , having been on the losing side in 2010 and 2008			2
the next chance to break that duck comes during the autumn tests next month where @entity3 are the visitors to @entity18 on november 15 , a week after the visit of @entity23 to the capital and a week before the match against @entity20 at @entity21			1
@entity0 's lost both his @entity1 encounters with the @entity3 in 2008 and 2010 the @entity27 player , speaking in the city 's @entity29 shopping mall at a ' come and try ' rugby session , admitted that he had unfinished business with the @entity33			1
@entity0 told @entity34 : ' i am looking forward to it			1
it is a good run of games against top quality ( teams ) and hopefully we will get that win against @entity3 which has eluded us for the last 100 years and more			2
' that would be nice			0
but it is always difficult when you play the @entity3			2
' they are always a good team , they have loads of talent in depth and we need to be playing our very best to beat them but i think we can do that			0
' @entity1 prop @entity0 attends the ' come and try ' event at the @entity29 on monday while @entity0 is coming down the hill in his career , @entity53 is just starting his ascent			1
the 22 - year - old @entity27 stand - off , whose two - year contract with the @entity61 club started at the beginning of the season , won his two caps to date against the @entity65 and @entity66 in the @entity10 ' summer tour and would be delighted just to get on against the @entity3			0
speaking at the same event , he said : ' they are a world class team , the best team in the world and if i got a run out against them then it would be a dream come true			0
' i would n't have thought about it before i played at under - 20s but after playing under - 20s and getting my contract , you have to look forward			0
' at the second - half of last season it became a real achievable goal			0
@entity0 ( back left ) and @entity53 ( back right ) join supporters at the event in @entity88 ' although they got beaten a couple of weeks ago by @entity89 they are still the best team in the world			1
' if they play with a full - strength team on their day , they are unstoppable			0
