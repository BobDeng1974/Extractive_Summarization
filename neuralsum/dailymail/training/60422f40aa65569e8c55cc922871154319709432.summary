last winter saw the extremes of a maiden @entity10 century in the toughest of circumstances in @entity12 and a broken wrist suffered while punching a locker in frustration for a man who was once sent home from a @entity19 tour in disgrace			1
it is the more positive side of a gifted cricketer who should be at the forefront of the @entity25 team for the next 10 years that @entity26 and @entity27 want to see as they begin their build - up to february ’s @entity30			1
@entity0 is hoping to be an integral part of the @entity25 squad for next year 's @entity30 @entity0 celebrates scoring a century in the third @entity10 in @entity12 last year ( left ) after a cool innings @entity34 - november 26 , @entity35 ( 9am bst ) second odi - november 29 , @entity35 ( 4.30am ) @entity37 - december 3 , @entity38 ( 9am ) @entity39 - december 6 , @entity35 ( 4.30am ) fifth odi - december 10 , @entity40 ( 9am ) sixth odi - december 13 , @entity40 ( 4.30am ) @entity41 - december 16 , @entity35 ( 9am ) @entity0 joined @entity25 at @entity42 on tuesday for a three - day training camp ahead of their one - day tour of @entity46 later this month and insisted that the self - inflicted indiscretions that have hindered his progress are a thing of the past			1
‘ i now know you ca n’t let emotion get the better of you , ’ said the all - rounder who guided @entity52 to the @entity53 last summer			1
‘ everybody knows i lost my temper easily when i was a kid and tended to look away from the game itself			2
now i can manage that to make sure i ’m getting the best out of myself			0
’ the locker incident , which came in @entity63 as @entity0 struggled to end a run of low scores , cost him his place at the @entity67 and at the start of a summer where he failed to nail down a regular place in all formats			1
but he insists it was not a symptom of a bigger problem for a 23 - year - old who has invited comparisons with @entity77 as much for his off - field habits as for his exciting all - round performances on it			2
@entity0 shows his feisty side by getting involved with @entity82 ( right ) earlier in the @entity10 in @entity12 the all - rounder kicks the ground in frustration during the second test against @entity87 at @entity88 batting tests 6 runs 279 highest score 120 average 25.36 hundreds 1 odis 21 runs 260 high score 70 average 16.25 339 @entity92 1 strike rate 76.69 @entity94 7 runs 49 high score 31 average 12.25 strike rate 128.94 bowling @entity99 bowl ( inns ) 6/99 best bowl ( match ) 8/161 average 32.90 5wkt inns 1 odis wickets 20 best bowl 5/61 average 31.40 economy rate 5.86 @entity94 wickets 0 economy rate 11.50 ‘ that incident was totally from wanting to do so well , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was n’t like i had lost my mind and become a psycho			0
it was completely my own fault , but i never want to lose my emotion			0
i now know that i should n’t punch lockers			0
it ’s just about dealing with failure in the right way			0
‘ mind you , the opposition could be scared of me , thinking , " i do n’t want to get on the wrong side of him			0
" i could just give them the " psycho " eyes then ! i do n’t think angry is the right word to describe my attitude but sometimes i have been overly competitive			0
when i do n’t do what i want it can become frustrating			0
’ it will be a more grown up @entity129 , he insists , who is about to embark on a prolonged spell of one - day cricket he hopes can help @entity25 upset the odds at the @entity30 in @entity133 and his native @entity134			1
not least in his attitude to the prospect of the arrival of his second child			2

‘ we have talked about it and @entity143 completely understands my job and the situation			0
she actually said ‘ if we tell our daughter you missed her birth because you were playing for your country i reckon she will think that ’s quite cool ’			0
’ that match in @entity0 ' old home town will see him come face to face with his county captain @entity170 , who this week rejoined the @entity139 coaching staff			2
‘ i ’ve played with him for a long time and he ’s a great captain and coach but it will be nice to beat them and rub it in his face , ’ smiled @entity129			0
more mature , perhaps , but clearly still with a competitive sense of mischief			0
