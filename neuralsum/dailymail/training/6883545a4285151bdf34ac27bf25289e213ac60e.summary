@entity0 is at the center of yet another controversy regarding its treatment of plus size customers			2
just six weeks after the retailer was forced to defend its decision to charge its female shoppers more money for larger sizes , a plus size customer on @entity11 has slammed the store for making its online plus size menu option twice the size of every other menu			1
' thanks for reminding me that i take up enough space for two categories , @entity0 , ' user @entity18 commented alongside an image of the offending menu , which seems to only appear on the brand 's @entity27 website			1
' @entity29 ' : @entity11 user @entity18 said that the menu layout on the brand 's @entity27 website was a cruel reminder that she ' takes up enough space for two categories ' the menu shows the different clothing categories offered in the online store , each of which feature an image of a model showcasing one of the store 's chosen fashion looks			1
however under the ' women ' and ' men ' options , which sit aside one another , the ' women 's plus ' link sits astride two columns , a layout which - once pointed out - has caused outrage with a number of other @entity11 users			2
many users have gone on to question why the women 's plus category requires its own menu option in the first place , when the men 's plus size selection - @entity61 and @entity64 - is just included in the main menswear category			1
' the weird part is , @entity0 does have a @entity61 and @entity64 selection in their men 's clothing , but you do n't really see it until you click on the item you want to buy , ' user lilfunky1 pointed out			2
' but the women 's stuff is separated out as a whole new category of @entity51			0
' according to one beady - eyed user , the reason for the bizarre menu layout is that the @entity27 version of the website does n't appear to offer a maternity section for women - the category which sits alongside women 's plus on the main @entity87 site			1
' [ the @entity90 site ] do n't have a maternity category for some reason , ' arnaudh explained			0
the smaller the size , the smaller the price : @entity0 's popular @entity95 are $ 34.94 if bought in sizes 0 to 20 unfair increase : any women who buy a pair of the @entity95 in a plus size fit will be charged an additional $ 10 , bringing the total price up to $ 44.94 ' if you go to the @entity87 version , it does n't display that way because of the additional category			2
@entity107 added : ' why would n't they have a maternity section in @entity27 ? does @entity0 believe that @entity27 are hatched from eggs ? ' in november , @entity112 - based merchandiser @entity111 called for @entity0 to scrap its ' discriminatory ' plus size up - charges , saying that the discrepancy between the prices for larger men and women is nothing other than ' straight up fat shaming '			1
and while the store insisted that ' unique fabrics and design elements ' were to blame for its female customers being charged more money for larger sizes - while the menswear designs remain the same price regardless of size - ms @entity111 insisted that the explanation was n't good enough			1
' @entity132 women like myself are kind of fed up with being treated like second - class citizens by retailers , ' the 34 - year - old told @entity136			0
' i think it 's reached critical mass and people are ready for a change			0
' after ms @entity111 started a petition on @entity144 , calling for the brand to change their gender - biased price policies , a spokeswoman for @entity142 , @entity0 's parent company , released a statement blaming the increased costs for plus - size womenswear on the fact that the larger designs require additional details not found in the smaller sizes @entity154 up : @entity111 ( pictured ) started a campaign in november to try and force @entity0 to scrap its ' discriminatory ' prices fighting for change : ms @entity111 's petition was signed by more than 33,000 people in a matter of days ' for women , styles are not just larger sizes of other women ’s items , they are created by a team of designers who are experts in creating the most flattering and on - trend plus styles , which includes curve - enhancing and curve - flattering elements such as four - way stretch materials and contoured waistbands , which most men 's garments do not include , ' spokeswoman @entity169 explained			1
' this higher price point reflects the selection of unique fabrics and design elements			0
' but ms @entity111 insisted that the statement did not address why there is not a single increase for any of the larger menswear designs , particularly as they also require the use of additional materials			0
' every woman knows how hard it is to find a good pair of jeans : a pair that is the right fit at the right price , ' she wrote on the petition			0
' that ’s why i was shocked when , during a recent visit to @entity0 ’s website , i noticed that they were charging $ 12 - $ 15 more for plus - sized women 's jeans - but not up - charging jeans for “ big ” men			0
' if they are charging plus - sized women more to cover the cost of the fabric being used , then why are n’t they doing the same for men ? ' according to the prices on the @entity0 website at the time of publication , the same differences in price between the plus size styles and the regular styles are still in effect .			0

a @entity11 user posted a screen grab from the store 's @entity27 site which shows the plus size menu option as being double the size of all the others
in november , the retailer was forced to defend its decision to charge more money for its larger sizes
