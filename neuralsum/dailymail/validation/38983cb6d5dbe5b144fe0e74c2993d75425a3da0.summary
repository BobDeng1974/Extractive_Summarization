@entity0 has promised to back @entity3 chairman @entity2 ’s attempts to clean up football ’s image and revealed how he sometimes has to silence himself to stop his touchline rage			1
@entity2 has this week promised action to stop the intimidation of officials which he claimed had become ‘ pretty scary ’ after seeing the images of @entity13 players surrounding @entity15 referee @entity14			1
‘ he has my complete support , ’ said @entity16 boss @entity0			1
‘ we all have to respect the referee and make their jobs as easy as possible			1
it ’s difficult enough for the referees — they are criticised a lot , and i include myself			1
i do remind my players but i do n’t think we have a problem with that			2
@entity2 , pictured at the @entity27 on friday , promised to take action to protect referees from hoards of players surrounding them @entity0 has promised to back the @entity3 chairman over stopping ref intimidation ‘ we have never been reproached so on that front i do n’t question myself too much			1
i question myself on my individual behaviour , that ’s true			2
’ @entity0 is often quick to let off steam at the fourth official and added : ‘ even sometimes at half - time i think , “ come on , stop that , my friend ” , you know ? and i think in the second half i will not say a word to him any more			1
‘ sometimes it helps you to get your frustration out but i do n’t think it is right , honestly			0
that does n’t mean i do n’t do it			0
i ’ve looked back on the tapes sometimes			0
’ @entity0 , who admits he needs to rein in his criticism of referees , talks to the fourth official on tuesday night the @entity16 manager has word with the fourth official during the @entity60 match against @entity61 @entity0 also fears the officials are getting drawn into the thick of the action when they could be more peripheral			1
‘ i have spoken about this with referees , ’ he said			1
‘ maybe they are too close today because sometimes they are in the way of the pass			0
i can show you situations where they hide the vision of the pass			0
because they are so directly involved they are surrounded sometimes when they should keep a bit of distance			0
’ @entity0 admits there are times when managers like to see their players showing desire and unity but agrees with @entity2 and @entity87 president @entity86 , who is also investigating ways to banish the problem in @entity91 games			1
eight @entity13 players surround the referee as they try to get @entity94 sent off for @entity95 ‘ we want everybody to be respected and the referees are part of everybody , ’ said the @entity16 boss			1
‘ what we have to do is respect the decisions			2
the referees know the worst offenders but i like to think it does n’t work			2
referees are prepared for that nowadays			2
they are warned and they can deal with it			0
‘ i agree completely that you want players to be ready to fight for each other			0
how far does that go ? you have to draw a line somewhere			0
you can not go after every decision of the referee			0
‘ in rugby it did n’t exist			0
unfortunately since they have become professional i have seen signs of them starting to question the decisions of the referees			2
so it may be a result of the pressure of the professional game			0
