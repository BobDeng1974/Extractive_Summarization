getting all the attention : bra'ds wife @entity31 ( right ) now has to ride her own bike instead of riding pillion behind @entity10 - all thanks to @entity5 who takes up her old space ! @entity5 brings smiles wherever he goes and has been known to spark spontaneous , paparazzi - like photo ops on more than one occasion – the most recent being @entity89 's ride for the @entity91 breast cancer fundraiser in @entity92 – @entity28 and @entity5 have sat on the motorcycle getting the attention and raising money holding on ! unlike other celebrities , @entity5 will work for belly rubs , treats and , especially , motorcycle rides the minute he got into the shop , he ran in , leaned against my leg and kind of adopted me			1
i called my wife and said , ' you 'd better set another place for dinner because we 've got a new family member			0

' when @entity10 got his @entity14 out , @entity5 jumped on board			1
like his owner , @entity5 wears eye protection while they ride and most of their trips are 150 miles or less at a time one big happy family : @entity31 ended up having to get her own bike after @entity5 took her place on @entity10 's bike ! holding on : @entity5 clings to @entity10 as the pair cruise effortlessly down the @entity38 ' he got excited and i said , ' get on or get run over and he ran up my knee into the back seat and has pretty much been there ever since			1
