at least there the end would have been swift			2
now it is drawn out and agonising			2
dumped without food and water by their owners , thousands of horses which would have been sold for meat are instead being condemned to a living hell			2
their plight is highlighted in a report by charities and animal sanctuaries , which are struggling with an influx of horses in appalling condition after unscrupulous dealers , hit by a slump in demand following the horsemeat scandal , abandoned them			2
she was so emaciated when animal welfare charity workers rescued her that her ribs poked through her coat			1
@entity26 was just a skeleton when she was rescued but has now made a full recovery around her in her muddy field lay the corpses of other horses which had not made it			1
rescuers got there just in time for @entity26			1
with veterinary treatment , she made a full recovery at a sanctuary and eight months on from being taken from that field in @entity44 , south @entity45 , she is today a popular addition to @entity47 ’s visitor centre in @entity48			1
but others have not been so lucky			1
@entity50 was being ‘ flygrazed ’ – a practice where owners , often from the travelling community , leave horses to graze on other people ’s land without permission – on a patch of scrub			1
in his desperation for food he ate something toxic , leading to a skin condition that left him with burnt - raw pink patches			1
he was neglected for so long that he also had maggots eating away at his body			1
vets battled to save the nine - month - old but three days after he was found in a @entity48 field in june , he suffered massive kidney and liver failure and died			1
in total , some 7,000 horses are considered ‘ at risk ’ , according to the report by leading charities including the @entity76 and @entity77 , with the horsemeat scandal a significant factor , but with over-breeding and the recession also playing a part			2
rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in january that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse			0
experts say there are owners who let their horses breed indiscriminately then become overwhelmed with the numbers produced			0
@entity50 was left to die after developing a skin condition when he ate something toxic			1
sadly he died of kidney and liver failure three days after being found but whereas the unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade , now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £ 100 a week to care for and feed them			1
the @entity100 , in @entity101 , @entity102 , is caring for a third more horses than this time last year and is spending more than ever on vets ’ bills as many arrive in a horrific condition			0
head trustee @entity108 said : ‘ before the horsemeat scare there was , sadly , a trade in horses for meat but now there ’s no market for them			0
‘ people do n’t want to pay to feed them or pay to have them put down , so unscrupulous owners are hiding them away in pockets of land and leaving them to starve very slowly and painfully to death			0
’ she said so many horses were arriving on the doorstep they were having to turn them away			0
‘ in just one day last week we had calls about six separate horses , two skeletal horses were brought to us that we took in , and one horse arrived on a trailer in such a bad state that it collapsed and had to be put down , ’ she said			0
@entity108 head trustee of @entity136 in @entity101 , @entity137 , says unwanted animals are being hidden and allowed to starve to death by owners who do n't want to pay to have them put down ‘ we try to take the worst ones that we can give a chance to and hope the better ones will survive a bit longer			0
you feel like an executioner having to choose which ones to take , i do n’t think anyone would like to make that life or death decision			0
’ before the recession , the sanctuary was able to rehome a horse every month but in the last two years it has found a new home for just one pony , as families are choosing cheaper pets			1
other animal charities have also seen a huge rise in the number of abandoned horses			0
@entity162 , in @entity163 , took in 40 per cent more in the first quarter of 2013 than in the same period last year and investigated 22 per cent more complaints about horse welfare			0
@entity77 admitted 16 per cent more horses between january and march this year than the year before , with four in ten being admitted for welfare concerns , compared with less than a third last year .			0

@entity26 was found in south @entity45 with ribs poking through skin
eight months on she has made a full recovery thanks to charity
@entity50 was less lucky after contracting skin *infection* while ' flygrazing '
found with maggots eating his skin and died three days later
