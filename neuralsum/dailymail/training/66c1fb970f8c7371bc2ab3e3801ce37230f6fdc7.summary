more than half a century ago , professor @entity0 ran studies into how ordinary people can do extraordinary harm to others when asked to do so			1
his conclusion , which formed the basis of his research film obedience , was that humans are programmed to obey orders , no matter how horrific			0
but now , new research suggests professor @entity0 was wrong - the participants did n’t act this way because they were inherently evil , instead their behaviour was influenced by the fact they believed they were contributing to science			1
but now , new research suggests the findings were wrong ; the participants did n’t act this way because they were evil , instead they were influenced by the fact they were contributing to science this made their actions seem more moral and worthy , and they were n't just obeying orders , they were happy to do so - and may have acted differently outside of the lab environment			1
in his experiment , which took place at @entity34 in 1961 , @entity0 asked volunteers to give what they thought were electric shocks of increasing strength to people who were trying but failing to learn a task			1
these ‘ students ’ were actors , but the volunteers believed the set up was genuine			0
in the best known variant of the study , two - thirds of people continued all the way up to the maximum 450 volt level			1
the studies have aroused furious controversy ever since , not only for their findings but for fears about the distress inflicted on those who participated			0
the research suggested that people will act in an evil way when they are obeying orders , and believe they wo n't be held responsible			1
this was an excuse used by @entity64 soldiers during war crime trials , for example , when questioned about their behaviour - that they were only following orders			0

however , a paper in the @entity99 , led by professor @entity100 from the @entity101 and professor @entity102 from @entity103 , claims the meaning of the experiment has been widely misunderstood			2
as a result of archival research by @entity109 - who spent several months researching in the archives at @entity34 - the team gained access to the feedback that 659 of the 800 volunteers provided at the end of the experiment – after they had been ‘ dehoaxed ’ by the experimenter			2

professor @entity100 said : ‘ it appears from this feedback that the main reason participants were n’t distressed is that they did not think they had done anything wrong			2
‘ this was largely due to @entity0 ’s ability to convince them that they had made an important contribution to science			1

‘ this was largely due to @entity0 ’s ability to convince them that they had made an important contribution to science			2
’ ‘ this provides new insight into the psychology of oppression and gels with other evidence that perpetrators are generally motivated , not by a desire to do evil , but by a sense that what they are doing is worthy and noble			2
these new understandings will contribute to a film called @entity177 , that is now in the final stages of post-production			0
the film begins where @entity182 film ended			0
it explores how people make the choice to obey authority - but also when they choose to disobey			0
professor @entity102 said : ‘ @entity189 ’s success comes down to the fact that he was a skilful dramatist as well as a psychologist			0
‘ @entity177 breaks open the @entity195 ’ paradigm and re-evaluates its conclusions			0
‘ it tells a powerful new story about the dark side of human nature through a creative collaboration across art and science that has broad relevance for contemporary society			0

in 1963 , professor @entity0 *submitted* a paper called @entity208
during tests , volunteers were told to give shocks to other participants
two - thirds of volunteers were willing to *administer* shocks up to 450 volts
it caused controversy for suggesting the participants could be *coerced* into acting in this way , when they were n't being held responsible
there were also concerns raised about *welfare* of those who were shocked
archival evidence now suggests the volunteers carried out the task because they felt they were contributing to science - not because they were evil
this made their participation seem more moral and worthy
