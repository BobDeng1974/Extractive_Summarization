as recently as last sunday , day - trippers looking to take a scenic drive through @entity1 were able to pull up directions on @entity3 to a tiny hamlet called @entity5 nestled in the @entity6			1
the distant , virtually unknown locale has since been wiped off the map , but the real kicker to this story is that @entity11 never really existed			0
in the early 1920s , a small patch of land between the towns of @entity15 and @entity16 in @entity17 was nothing more than a dirt - road intersection of @entity20 and @entity21			1
paper town : on march 17 , 2014 , @entity3 removed the fictitious town of @entity5 from the virtual map of @entity1 - nearly 90 years after it was created by a pair of cartographers geographic ruse : @entity28 , head of the @entity30 , and his assistant , @entity31 , made up a fake town and positioned it in @entity17 as a way to protect their map from being lifted by other companies hardly anyone ever visited the largely deserted , out - of - the - way site located some 120miles from @entity39 , which made it an ideal ' copyright trap , ' as @entity41 reported last week , citing @entity43 ' blog @entity44			1
cartographers seeking to prevent other companies from lifting their work without permission often resorted to trickery , inserting fictitious landmarks as tell - tale signs of piracy			0
that is what @entity28 , head of the @entity30 , had in mind when he teamed up with his assistant , @entity31 , to concoct an entirely imaginary ' paper town ' , which the pair dubbed @entity5 - the name an anagram of their initials , @entity64 and @entity31 the @entity30 , one of the ' big three ' mapmakers in the country in the 1930s , sought to safeguard its intellectual property			1
to do that , @entity28 and @entity31 positioned the entirely fake hamlet of @entity5 on the map of @entity1 just north of @entity73			1
in the event of a copyright lawsuit , all they needed to do to prove that their map had been pirated was to point to @entity5 , which obviously did not exist on any other map except their own because it was fake			0
@entity28 and @entity31 ' clever ruse was put to the test when a few years later , the map company @entity85 printed its own version of a @entity88 map , which featured the made - up @entity5			1
in a bizarre twist , when @entity85 officials were questioned in court about the existence of the fake homestead on their map , identical in its spelling and location to that of the @entity30 ’s , the competitors pointed out that their draftsmen found a building in that location called the @entity101 , suggesting that the business was named after a geographic location			0
it so happened that the country store 's name was inspired by @entity28 and @entity31 ' fake town , which the owners had discovered on a map at an @entity112 gas station , thus effectively turning a ' paper town ' into a real place			2
ironic twist : when @entity28 sued the map company @entity85 for ripping off his map containing the bogus ' copyright trap ' hamlet of @entity5 , the defendants pointed out that their draftsmen found a building in that location called the @entity101 in the @entity124 ’ retelling of the story , it was a fishing lodge named @entity5 , not a general store , which helped @entity85 get off the hook in the copyright case			2
in the @entity124 account , about five years after @entity28 came up with @entity5 , he paid a visit to the fishing lodge named after the fake town and informed its proprietor that he was the one who put the place on the map , literally			1
however it may be , over the years , the enigmatic @entity5 has gained a small following among amateur cartographers - and more recently , bookish teens			2
in 1957 , a piece in the @entity124 waxed poetic about scenic drives through the @entity6 and mentioned ' an unmarked country road that goes north through @entity15 and @entity5			0
' @entity5 's popularity spiked in 2008 , when the make - believe town appeared in @entity146 's young adult novel called ' @entity147 ' ( soon to be turned into a motion picture produced by @entity149 )			0
all that remains of the fabled @entity5 now is a derelict barn , a former creamery , an old wooden airport hanger , a castle - like structure owned by the @entity156 , and the rundown building that once housed the @entity5 fishing lodge			0
but the legend of @entity5 , the @entity1 @entity160 , lives on .			0

@entity5 is fictional town that mapmakers @entity28 and @entity31 put on map of @entity17 in 1925
@entity166 's name is anagram of @entity28 and @entity31 ' initials - @entity64 and @entity169
site is a dirt - road intersection between @entity15 and @entity16
@entity3 removed fake hamlet march 17 , nearly 90 years after it was created by cartographers
