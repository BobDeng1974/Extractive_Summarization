by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ kie1410 for some , playing for @entity2 means everything			2
an honour , a duty , a reward , call it what you will			0
@entity10 , however , is a 17 - year - old youth product of @entity12 who disagrees , having pledged his allegiance to @entity15 after politely declining advances from @entity2 scouts			1
the half - @entity15 , half - @entity19 attacking midfielder has grown up admiring the @entity21 way while learning his trade at @entity12 , a club that prides itself on nurturing players of flair			1
citizenship in football often sparks debates - as it did with @entity30 's @entity29 - yet for @entity10 , who takes @entity15 lessons twice a week , it ’s as simple a decision as they come			1
‘ always my mindset was that i wanted to play for @entity15			0
since i was 10 , it 's always been an ambition of mine			0
‘ if they keep progressing as quickly , then they will be better than @entity2 and a lot of nations in the future			2
i think a lot of the boys ( in this country 's youth system ) are also looking elsewhere rather than @entity2			2
' a lot of people in the youth system are not really admiring the @entity2 team and the @entity19 way of playing football			2
for me , i have always pictured myself playing for @entity15			0
’ so much so that @entity10 , when visiting his grandparents near @entity68 in the @entity15 city of @entity70 , would buy a new @entity15 kit every year			1
@entity10 ’s father , @entity72 , is an artist from @entity2 but it is his mother , @entity74 , who makes him eligible to play for @entity15			1
despite straying from his father ’s profession , the attacking midfielder exhibits a similar creativity in his style of play , which has led to interest from @entity82			1
in action : @entity10 takes @entity15 lessons twice a week after training and turned down playing for @entity2 challenge : @entity15 suits the creative style of the attacking midfielder more and the starlet rightfully agrees @entity89 , @entity90 ( also eligible for @entity91 ) @entity92 , @entity93 , on loan from @entity95 ( also eligible for @entity96 ) @entity97 , @entity95 ( also eligible for @entity98 or @entity99 ) @entity100 , @entity93 , on loan from @entity102 ( also eligible for @entity103 ) @entity104 , @entity12 ( also eligible for @entity96 ) in 2013 @entity10 made his international debut for @entity15 's under - 16s at the @entity107 in @entity108 after impressing scouts from the @entity15 @entity110 that were touring @entity111 for talent			1
they , like @entity12 , were intrigued by @entity10 's technical ability , and were in no way deterred by the pint - sized starlet 's frame			1
@entity10 , yet to master the @entity15 language , admits being lost in translation was a burden but he found a way around it			2
again , creativity was shown			0
you are thrown into a whole different situation that you have n’t experienced , ’ @entity10 tells @entity124			0
‘ i ’m not the best at speaking @entity15 , but i was able to settle in really well			0
they helped me with tactics , and other things you come to understand as you play			0
' you can also understand through hand signals			0
if i wanted them to pass , i would just say “ yeah ” in @entity19			0
’ it is n’t anything new			0
@entity45 ’s @entity137 , the @entity138 ’s all - time top goalscorer , was born in @entity139 but the striker succumbed to his new land			2
artwork : a fan made this poster for @entity10 after his international debut at the 2013 @entity107 @entity145 ( was also eligible for @entity99 , @entity146 , @entity91 and @entity147 ) @entity148 ( was also eligible for @entity149 ) @entity150 ( was also eligible for @entity99 ) @entity151 ( was also eligible for @entity152 or @entity91 ) @entity153 ( was also eligible for @entity91 , @entity146 or @entity147 ) in @entity2 there has been @entity40 ’s @entity39 , who previously represented the @entity155 across four youth levels , and the more recent case of @entity30 ’s @entity29			1
for now @entity10 is simply keen to concentrate on his @entity12 career , hoping a senior contract is in the pipeline , but then what for the tricky two - footed forward ? ‘ i would like to go out and play in @entity15 one day , ’ continues @entity10			1
‘ when i went to @entity15 and saw the crowds , i was impressed			0
' they are just so passionate , similar to @entity43 fans			0
it is a great environment if you are playing in front of that crowd			0
‘ one of my ambitions is to represent @entity15 in a massive tournament , but i think that is a bit too far in the future to think about at the moment			1
’ until then , @entity10 , who has drawn comparisons to @entity82 's newest no 7 @entity178 , will continue to learn the language			1
the starlet remains eligible for @entity2 at senior level but hopes to one day be a part of the @entity15 team he 's admired from afar for more than a decade .			1

@entity10 *bravely* turned down @entity2 and represented @entity15 's under - 16s after being called up in 2013 - despite not knowing the language
the @entity12 attacking midfielder grew up in south @entity46 and now takes @entity15 lessons twice a week after training *sessions*
the 17 - year - old has been on @entity195 giants @entity82 's radar and hopes to represent @entity15 at a major tournament in the near future
@entity10 reveals it 's not *uncommon* for youth players eligible to look elsewhere to snub @entity2 as the @entity2 are *n't* particularly admired
@entity30 's @entity29 , @entity40 's @entity39 and @entity45 's @entity44 are among others that could have represented @entity2
