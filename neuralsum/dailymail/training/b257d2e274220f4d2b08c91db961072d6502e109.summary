by @entity0 from @entity2 to smartwatches , wearable technology seems to be the next big thing in the world of gadgets			1
but what if one of the most popular forms of wearable tech , fitness sensors that monitor your health , did n’t need to be wearable at all ? researchers at the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) claim they ’ve designed such a system that measures vital signs through brick walls , and could one day do - away with the smart wristbands			1
the precise system measures the rise and fall of a person 's chest so , for example , parents could monitor their sleeping baby while they are not in the room ( pictured ) the research was conducted at @entity15 ’s @entity37 , hosted in the @entity38 and @entity39 ( @entity39 )			1
the system works by transmitting a low - power wireless signal and using its reflections to track moving humans			2
it can do so even if the humans are in closed rooms or hiding behind a wall			0
as the signal is transmitted at a wall , a portion of the signal penetrates through , reflecting off a person on the other side			0
using a complex metric , the precise technology then estimates the size of the person			0
the technology is so accurate it can measure the minute changes in a person ’s chest as they breathe , giving a reading for their heart rate with 99 per cent accuracy			1

this could , for example , monitor a baby ’s breathing and heart rate remotely , or keep an eye on an elderly living at home alone			1
and the same method could have even more uses , from recognising gestures and controlling ‘ smart ’ objects in a room , to even detecting emotions			0

as the signal is transmitted at a wall , a portion of the signal penetrates through , reflecting off a person on the other side in the research , tiny antennas placed behind a wall were able to track the position of a person to mere centimetres			0
each antenna was about the size of a coin ( left ) and , in the experiment , they were wired together ( right ) to monitor people through walls there are various pieces of wearable technology on the market today with different functions			1
@entity125 smart wristbands , for example , are used to measure steps , stairs climbed , calories burned and sleep			0
some also include a full @entity131 screen that can supply additional information for users earlier this year @entity125 stopped sales of its £ 80 ( $ 130 ) force fitness wristband after users discovered it could cause an allergic reaction			0
in a letter posted on the company website ceo and co-founder @entity138 said about 1.7 percent of users reported skin irritation			0
@entity125 said independent test results had not found problems with the @entity147 's battery or electrical systems , suggesting that users may have had allergic reactions to nickel in the device or materials used in the strap or adhesives used to make the force			0
the team - which includes @entity158 , a professor of electrical engineering and computer science , and graduate students @entity161 and @entity163 - has also developed the capability to track the movements of up to four distinct individuals			2
this could be helpful for search - and - rescue operations , such as when emergency responders are trying to find survivors inside a burning building			0
‘ it has traditionally been very difficult to capture such minute motions that occur at the rate of mere millimetres per second , ’ said @entity15 professor of electrical engineering computer science @entity173 , a co-author for the paper containing the study who also directs the @entity37			2
‘ being able to do so with a low - cost , accessible technology opens up the possibilities for people to be able to track their vital signs on their own			2
’ in the past year , a number of such wireless systems have sprung up aside from @entity189 including @entity190 , also designed at @entity15			1
this device can plot movements and even follow gestures , meaning that a person can switch a light off in a separate room just by raising their arm			0
ground breaking : @entity190 can track movements and gestures , such as pointing at a lamp to switch it on , through walls without using cameras or wearable technology using radio signals about 1,000 times less powerful than a smartphone , so - called @entity190 bounces off objects detected through a wall to pinpoint a person			1
@entity190 relies on several antennas to plot movements , and an algorithm is then used to sift through readings caused by waves hitting household objects such as sofas			0
the designers behind @entity190 envision it being used for video games and to control household appliances			1
the technology can even be used to track movements in a room ( pictured ) through walls			2
this could be useful to monitor the condition of elderly people who live alone			1
it could also provide a new way to play video games			1
current system 's such as @entity234 's @entity233 rely on line - of - sight to work , for example with video games , players would no longer have to remain in front of the computer , and could stalk enemies in hallways and launch ambushes from behind the sofa			1
it could also be used to help monitor elderly people who are at risk of falling , without an individual having to wear an alarm or put cameras inside their home			1
while it will be years before the device is ready for commercial release , it is already making its mark as being cheaper than other devices and also does away with the need of cameras and other wearable technology .			1

scientists at @entity15 have unveiled a wireless system that can monitor the heart rate of people in another room
called @entity189 , it monitors chest movements and is 99 per cent accurate
researchers claim it could *replace* health - tracking wearable technology
and it is the first *multi-person* motion tracking system in operation
*potential* uses of the system include monitoring babies and elderly people
it could also be used play @entity233 - style video games in a new way
