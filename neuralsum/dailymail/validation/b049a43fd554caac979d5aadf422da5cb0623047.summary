@entity2 ’s @entity1 future is in serious doubt after he and dad @entity4 took the decision to snub a place at the @entity7 this summer			1

@entity2 snr – @entity1 ’s first black captain – has told @entity8 they want to concentrate on @entity2 ’s club career rather than represent his country in @entity17			1
@entity2 has been left out of the latest @entity1 under 21 squad by @entity8 at his own request @entity2 , currently on loan at @entity21 , has been a regular under @entity8 but will now not be selected goalkeepers @entity23 ( @entity24 ) @entity25 ( @entity26 ) @entity27 ( @entity28 ) defenders @entity30 ( @entity31 ) @entity32 ( @entity33 ) @entity34 ( @entity35 ) @entity36 ( @entity37 ) @entity38 ( @entity39 , on loan from @entity31 ) @entity41 ( @entity42 ) @entity43 ( @entity44 , on loan from @entity46 ) @entity47 ( @entity35 ) @entity48 ( @entity49 ) midfielders @entity51 ( @entity52 , on loan from @entity33 ) @entity54 ( @entity55 , on loan from @entity57 ) @entity58 ( @entity59 ) @entity60 ( @entity21 ) @entity61 ( @entity21 , on loan from @entity63 ) @entity64 ( @entity44 , on loan from @entity33 ) @entity65 ( @entity66 ) @entity67 ( @entity49 ) forwards @entity69 ( @entity37 , on loan from @entity57 ) @entity71 ( @entity72 ) @entity73 ( @entity42 ) @entity74 ( @entity75 ) that is certain to leave a bitter taste among those at the @entity79 , including senior manager @entity80			1
@entity8 said : ‘ i have told @entity2 and @entity4 they need to be aware of the possible consequences of this decision in terms of how it would appear from the outside			1
i think they understand that			0
‘ i have had discussions with @entity2 and his dad over the last week or so and the message from both was exactly the same			1
i have to say i was surprised			0
‘ it was not something we ’d been conscious of previously and it is for @entity2 to explain his full reasons			2
‘ but he feels at this moment in time he has got some priorities at club level			0
there is some uncertainty about where he is going to be next season			0
’ @entity8 – speaking at @entity37 ’s @entity109 where he announced his squad for forthcoming friendlies with @entity17 and @entity113 - added : ‘ he will not be involved in the summer now			2
that ’s because he has been through qualifying and i assumed he would have wanted to put himself on this big stage			0
@entity1 captain @entity115 has his head bandaged and shirt covered in blood during a @entity120 qualifier against @entity121 in @entity122 in 1997 @entity8 has warned @entity2 and father @entity4 of the consequences of the player turning his back on @entity1 ‘ i think in life you should be as open as you can to opportunities and stay in positions that lead to opportunities			1
@entity2 has decided this is an opportunity he does n't want to take			2
’ @entity2 is currently on loan at @entity21 after falling out of favour at @entity134 , the club he only joined last summer amid interest from @entity136			2
however , it now appears he will again be on the move in the close - season			0
it was only this season that the 23 - year - old told @entity142 about his pride at representing @entity1			2
indeed , his dad ’s blood - stained @entity1 shirt from the famous goalless draw in @entity121 which secured qualification for @entity148 ’ 98 is framed at home			1
@entity2 challenges for the ball with @entity37 's @entity151 during tuesday 's top - of - the - table clash and @entity2 had hoped for promotion to @entity80 ’s full squad after his appearance at the @entity156			1
‘ i ’ve had two great years at under - 21 level and my ambition now is to try to push for the senior team , ’ he said in september			0
‘ playing for a club in the @entity161 and the exposure that comes with that will hopefully provide me with the pathway to do it			0
‘ you can see at the minute @entity80 is giving a lot of young players from the under - 21s and @entity161 clubs a chance			0
i hope i can get that opportunity – although it does n’t mean i do n’t appreciate playing for the under - 21s at major tournaments			0

@entity2 has snubbed a place at the 2015 @entity176
his dad @entity4 was @entity1 's first black captain and won *53* caps
@entity181 manager @entity8 has made clear the consequences
