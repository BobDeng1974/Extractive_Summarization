by @entity1 reporter published : 20:00 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 20:37 est , 14 january 2014 sufficient : when children are left to decide their portions they learn to recognise when they are full passing bowls of food around the table at family - style meals can help beat child obesity by teaching youngsters about portion control , new research suggests			1
for when children and child - care providers sit around a table together at mealtime , children learn to recognise when they are full in comparison to when food is pre-plated for them , the latest study shows			1
the findings came from a study of feeding practices of two to five - year - old children in 118 child - care centres in the @entity31			1
it report 's author , @entity32 , the director of the @entity34 @entity33 , said : ' family - style meals give kids a chance to learn about things like portion size and food preferences			1
when foods are pre-plated , children never develop the ability to read their body ’s hunger cues			2
' they do n’t learn to say , okay , this is an appropriate portion size for me			2
@entity50 said : ' instead of asking are you done ? teachers should ask children , are you full ? or they should say , if you ’re hungry , you can have some more , explained @entity50 , who is developing a packet of best feeding practices to share with providers			1
' asking the right questions can help children listen to their hunger and satiety signals , ' she said			2
the @entity34 research is the first study to evaluate whether child - care providers are adhering to the academy ’s guidelines for feeding practices			1
most providers did promote healthy feeding by serving nutritious foods and not pressuring children to eat or restricting them from eating			0
@entity73 programs stood out though as having the best policies and feeding practices			0
leaning to stop : a researcher from the @entity34 said children eating when the are not hungry teaches them not to take notice of their body signals ( file picture ) in fact , @entity73 teachers who use family - style meals are strong advocates for them , the researchers said			1
' teachers who do n’t do family - style meals have all these reasons that they do n’t : there ’s too much waste , it ’s messy , young kids do n’t have the developmental skills - the fine motor control - to do that , ” @entity87 said			2
' but @entity73 teachers were telling us ways you could help develop those fine motor skills : for instance , using scoops in the sandbox or pouring water in the water table , ' he added			0
' when you first do easel painting with a two - year - old , it ’s really messy because they do n’t have fine motor control , but you still do it even though it ’s messy			1
' the same thing is true for family - style meal service			0
it may be messy at first until they develop the appropriate skills and learn to pour the right way or hold the cup as they ’re pouring			0
it ’s a developmental progression , ' he said			0
' if children do n’t want to eat , teachers should n’t urge them to eat anyway out of concern that the kids may get hungry before the next meal or snack is served			2
' if a child does n’t eat at one meal , he ’ll compensate for it over a 24 - hour period			0
making kids eat when they ’re not hungry is probably the worst thing you can do			0
it teaches them not to pay attention to their body ’s signals , ' @entity50 said .			0

children learn to recognise when they are full if food is not pre-plated
findings came from study of two to five - year - olds in @entity31 care centres
instead of asking ' are you done ' , teachers should ask children ' are you full '
