can a single finger test determine whether you are beautiful or ugly ? apparently so , if the latest social media craze is anything to go by			1
on @entity5 , the @entity6 version of @entity7 , thousands of users are participating in the ' @entity8 ' also known as the ' finger trap test '			1
so how do you determine if you 're ' beautiful ' ? place your index finger against your chin and nose to see if your lips touch it			1
if they do , congratulations , you 're officially hot			2
if they do n't , just ignore the results			0
beauty test : on @entity5 , the @entity6 version of @entity7 , thousands of users are participating in the ' @entity8 ' also known as the ' finger trap test ' , if your finger touches your lips , you 're officially beautiful like @entity23 , pictured even @entity6 celebrities have posted photos of themselves trying out the bizarre test , which is trending in over 200,000 @entity5 discussions , where the majority of participants are women			1
the trend , which was spotted by @entity32 , is being dubbed @entity6 's digital answer to ' @entity34 '			1
it is loosely based on the 3.1 ratio theory , which is used by cosmetic surgeons to create the ' perfect profile ' which equates to your nose , lips and chin all being in a perfect line down your face			1
is he hot ? the trend is being dubbed @entity6 's digital answer to ' @entity34 ' ; @entity47 , pictured , is beautiful , if the test is anything to go by dr @entity50 at @entity51 said of the test : ' this is actually a bone fide test for lower facial symmetry and proportions			1
it is called @entity58 's @entity57			2
' like the @entity60 devised by the ancient @entity61 , they are tests experienced cosmetic doctors use when assessing and planning cosmetic treatments			0
' is it a sign of beauty ? that 's a stretch			0
but part of beauty is determined by symmetry and correct proportions			0
however , it take no account of someone 's energy and personality			0
' not so hot : @entity78 is n't classed as attractive but it 's ok , beauty is only skin deep , after all ... consultant cosmetic surgeon @entity82 , who works out of the @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity86 , added : ' although this trend is based on classical principles that date back to the time of @entity91 it is a very simplistic view and beauty is based on much more than one set of ratios			2
' it â€™s a fun test to do but must be taken with a pinch of salt			0
beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder but we must remember that throughout the world different races not only have different characteristics but also different beauty ideals and therefore this is far too general to convey any real meaning			0
' this concept dates back to the 1950s and the work of the orthodontist dr. @entity109 , who focused on what he called the ' @entity111 '			0
this is simply a line drawn from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin			2
he believed that to have what he called a ' pleasing facial profile ' , in the average caucasian face , the lips would touch the plane - or in the finger trap 's case , the finger - running from the nose to the chin .			1

known as ' @entity127 ' or ' finger trap test '
based on the 3.1 ratio , used by surgeons to create ' perfect profile '
trending on @entity5 , @entity6 's answer to @entity7
place your index finger against chin and nose to see if your lips touch it
if they do , you 're officially ' beautiful '
