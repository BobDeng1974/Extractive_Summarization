@entity0 says women who want to have it all have more of a chance of getting there if they rule out motherhood as a goal			1
' it ’s vital women are less tough on other women			2
we ca n’t have it all , ' she said			2
' the women who know they do n’t want children come closer to having it all than any of us do			1
' as mothers , we feel guilt			0
guilt is the plague of the modern woman			0
' it ’s the first time i 've ever admitted it , i had set a date at which i was going to try and have a child by myself and found two people who wanted to father my children			1
' because i have strong breast cancer gene in my family i was always very aware of importance of having children early			2
i made that decision , set that personal date and that had released me			2
' and then i was luckily enough that i met someone and we had children			2
' @entity50 , @entity0 , @entity51 and @entity52 , of @entity53 , attend the @entity55 talk her comments came as she spoke about the perils of fertility and late motherhood at a @entity61 talk in @entity62 last week			1
earlier this year , the star came under attack for claiming that women should put off careers and focus on having a baby by the age of 27 , because it 's much harder to get pregnant later on			1
but the mother - of - two is undeterred and at a special talk in @entity62 she was once again warning @entity73 ladies about the perils of leaving it until your late thirties to start a family			1
she said : ' the facts can not be got away from			0
you have a 10 per cent chance of conceiving a child over 40			0
i do n't say this smugly - i got in just under the wire			1
' i think women are being lied to			2
' it gets more and more difficult to have children over the age of 35			1
' plenty of women do n't want children , that 's fine - but if you do , you need to know the facts			1
' @entity0 advised women to think seriously about delaying university until after their children are born			1
she said : ' i want to say to women : be honest with each other , with your partners , daughters and sons - know that you can have careers at any age , you can go to uni at any age			1
' you can do a thousand brilliant things at any age			2
but just for now , we have n't opened the fertility window any wider			2
' it is easier and simpler and less of a heartache to just have children when our bodies allow us to			2
' nature is not a feminist and that 's just the truth			0
' @entity119 can put an immense pressure on a relationship , with the procedure tripling the likelihood of divorce ( picture posed by models ) although @entity0 's comments on fertility were heavily criticised by certain feminist corners when she first made them this year , the star is n't alone in her opinions			1
her views are backed up by the latest research figures from the @entity134 and @entity135 , which show that the average woman aged 30 only has 12 per cent of her eggs left , while a woman turning forty has only three per cent left in her reserves			0
on top of that , data from the @entity141 and @entity142 shows @entity119 had a global failure rate of 77 per cent in 2012			0
@entity146 is the founder of @entity147 , a support network for childless women in the @entity73 who believes too many older women think @entity119 will come to their rescue			2
@entity146 started trying for a baby with her husband aged 29 , but the marriage broke down in her late - thirties			2
she hoped to meet a new partner and try ivf but a suitable relationship did not materialise			0
at the age of 43 she found herself single again and had to begin the process of grieving and accepting her childlessness			2
now she has built a community of women who share her situation			2
she runs workshops and retreats in @entity62 and @entity168 helping women who are also making the transition to a life without the family they hoped for			2
@entity146 predicts that the country is sitting on a ticking time bomb of women who are delaying pregnancy until it 's too late			1
she said : ' @entity180 infertility is the biggest thing for the next generation			0
' in one generation , the worst social stereotype has gone from being a single mother to a woman over 40 without children			1
' we see people conceiving in their forties , but they 're extremely lucky , it 's this mythical age			0
@entity146 is the founder of @entity147 , a support network for childless women in the @entity73 ' in one generation we 've had access to all of these things that give freedom to women ; access to abortion , access to higher education , access to professions and legal access to birth control			0
' but fertility is not a feminist , it is focused on us having children when we 're young			0
' the problem does n't just lie with delaying pregnancy though , it is also our belief that @entity119 is going to be the solution			0
much is written about the difficulty of going through in vitro fertilization , but @entity146 feels there is n't enough discussed with potential patients about how low the chances of success really are			0
she said : ' most of us get an education from the miracle stories - there is very little awareness that globally 77 per cent of @entity119 has failed			0
' most women who are struggling to conceive do n't know that there is a five per cent success rate for women aged 43 - 44 , that becomes under two per cent success for women 44 and over			1
artificial insemination of a human female egg - the process has a 77 per cent global failure rate ' if i 'd have known that before i started @entity119 , i would n't have tried it			1
' at @entity146 's @entity236 community , thousands of women come together for support			0
she said : ' if you 're childless and a single woman , it 's shameful , it 's like you 're not a real woman , it 's like you 've failed			0
' whenever i 'm in the media , there 's a huge response , it shows people have been reached			0
' i 'm doing it so there is a resource there that was n't there when i needed it			0
' i 'm just one individual but i 'm looking after so many women , because there is so little information out there about it - that 's a taboo for you			1
' more and more women are now putting off having babies until their forties but while there is little that women can do to control the amount of eggs the lose during the ageing process , fertility clinics are keen to point out that they can be very successful in offering other solutions			1
freezing eggs is encouraged egg donors are also suggested as a crucial option for women who are struggling to conceive			1
dr @entity274 is medical director of the @entity275 , a practice which makes patients aware very early on in fertility treatments of all of the options available			0
she said : ' it is true , that a significant group of our patients are women over 40 years of age			1
in the last few years , we have seen the number of women in this age category coming to the clinic for fertility treatment dramatically rise			1
' however , as the saying goes ‘ @entity291 wait for none ’			0
' to avoid this desperate situation , women need to be aware first and foremost and should be encouraged to freeze their eggs in their twenties and early thirties if they are going to delay childbearing			0
' ( and ) women in their forties can improve their fertility by leading a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced diet with high protein and high fibre , exercising regularly and avoiding smoking , drinking and using recreational drugs			0
' freezing eggs and egg donors are often helpful solutions for women wanting to delay having a child ( pregnant woman posed by model ) a spokesperson for the @entity317 has also cautioned that success rate for @entity119 have improved dramatically in recent years			1
they said : ' while @entity119 techniques have progressed significantly in the last 20 - 30 years and are improving all the time , it is important to remember that @entity119 does not guarantee success			1
' fertility levels drop significantly when a woman passes her mid- 30s , and we would always encourage women to inform themselves of the facts around fertility and @entity119 - as the fact is that the chance of success for a woman of 35 is around one in three			1
' it is also very important that women discuss their options with clinicians , to ensure any treatment is suited to their circumstances			0
' however , there is no getting away from the fact that for women to be aware that they should even be freezing their eggs in the late twenties , they need to be better educated about fertility			0
@entity146 is now campaigning for fertility to be taught in schools alongside sex education , so that both men and women are aware of the situation when they are growing up			1
she said : ' statistically , if you 're talking to a group of teenagers , it is more likely that they are going to have fertility problems than that they are going to have a child before they are 18			0
@entity146 believes that girls and boys should be taught about fertility alongside sex education at school ' what women have done in our generation is we have gone into a professional working world that is built around the male template of fertility , which is to work really hard in your twenties and thirties and have a family in your forties			1
' we have adopted a male pattern of working and it does n't fit female fertility			0
' we need to have some very big changes in the way our society is structured if women are going to be able to have children			1
' @entity146 is the author of rocking the @entity388 : 12 - weeks to your plan b for a @entity391 .			0
