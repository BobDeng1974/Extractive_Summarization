with these charming sculptures made of butter , it ’s easy to see why artist @entity4 ’s reputation is spreading fast			1
but be careful not to warm to them too much , or they ’ll be toast			0
the sculptures measure up to two feet long and take months at a time to make			1
they include a vintage @entity10 and a scene from @entity12			0
a soft touch : talented artist - and former chef - @entity4 spends months at a time carefully crafting the slippery sculptures , including this one showing a scene from @entity12 the latter last week won the food art award at the @entity20 , an international cuisine competition held every four years in @entity21 , although presumably it was a knife - edge decision			1
mr @entity22 , 49 , needs a smooth touch when painstakingly crafting the scenes using tiny scalpels			1
he said : ‘ i started making butter sculptures nearly 30 years ago when i was working as a chef			2

i thought it sounded like fun			0
’ talented : artist and former chef @entity4 spends months at a time carefully crafting the slippery sculptures the father - of - one from @entity41 , @entity42 , begins by creating a basic structure out of stainless steel , before covering the wire in butter and moulding it into shape			1
as long as he keeps the artworks out of direct sunlight , and away from radiators , they can last for years – although they have to be stored in plastic cases to keep the dust off			2
he said : ‘ once i start sculpting , i am totally absorbed in it			0
butter - sketch : @entity4 's creations , such as this vintage @entity10 , can last for years if they are kept out of direct sunlight enough to melt the heart : the sculptures are amazingly finely detailed ' i have a little room in our house dedicated to sculpting , and once i ’m in there , my family know not to even try to get my attention until i ’ve finished			1
‘ my wife is very patient and understanding			0
’ he added : ‘ i ’m pleased the competition went well , and that i ’ll have some time off before i start my next sculpture			2
‘ i might stick to jam on my toast for a while though – i ’m a bit sick of butter			0
