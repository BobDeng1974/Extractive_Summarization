he is already the longest serving heir apparent in @entity2 history			0
so if prince @entity3 ever gets too bored of waiting to accede to the throne , then he might just be tempted to have himself crowned @entity5 111 instead			2
central @entity7 newspapers yesterday were alight with speculation that the @entity3 could be anointed the next @entity9 if the country ’s monarchy is restored			1
related : speculation has mounted that prince @entity3 could be crowned king of @entity13 after he revealed in a recent interview that he is related to bloodthirsty @entity13 ruler @entity15 the @entity16 the last royal ruler , @entity17 – who reigned from 1927 to 1930 , and again from 1940 to 1947 - was forced to abdicate by the country ’s new communist leaders , who threatened to carry out mass executions if he refused to step down			1
@entity13 went on to endure decades of communist government , most notably under dictatorial party leader @entity23 who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1965 until he was deposed and executed in 1989			0
admittedly , it is unlikely that he will ever be a serious contender for the throne as the deposed @entity9 , @entity29 , is still alive – albeit rather elderly at 90 – and has family of his own			0
despite the reintroduction of democracy , in recent years there have been increasing calls for the monarchy to be restored			0
and after he revealed in an interview just a few weeks ago that he is related to historical @entity13 ruler @entity15 – the bloodthirsty nobleman who inspired @entity39 – @entity3 ’s name has now , bizarrely , been thrown into the ring			1
connections : prince @entity3 further cemented his links with @entity13 when he held a private meeting with @entity13 tourism minister @entity45 at @entity46 last week but local newspapers have taken great pains to point out that as well as his ‘ stake ’ in the throne through his ancestor @entity15 , prince @entity3 ’s mother , @entity49 , is also third cousin to the deposed @entity9 whose great - great - grandmother was queen @entity54			1
the rumour mill went into further overdrive when the country ’s powerful tourism and development minister , @entity57 , flew to @entity60 last week to meet with @entity3 at @entity46			1
the meeting was not publicised in advance , although pictures were subsequently released , and the glamorous @entity57 subsequently spoke of her host in glowing terms and said @entity13 should be more like @entity3 and ‘ appreciate the country they live in ’			1
links : @entity49 met @entity13 president @entity69 , at @entity70 in 2004 ( left ) - but her ties with the monarchy are stronger - she is third cousin to @entity13 's @entity17 ( right ) who reigned from 1927 to 1930 and again from 1940 to 1947 - but was forced to abdicate by the country 's new @entity75 leaders newspapers have even gone so far as to speculate that @entity3 could give up the @entity2 throne in favour of his popular eldest son and heir , prince @entity82 , to become the next @entity9 instead			1
they say the suggestion has such currency it is the reason its rattled president , @entity86 , has launched a series of attacks on the former @entity17 and the monarchy in general			2
iron fist : @entity13 endured decades of communist government , most notably under @entity23 who ruled from 1965 until he was deposed and executed in 1989 intriguingly @entity3 is incredibly passionate about @entity13			2
indeed , he loves the area around the @entity93 in @entity94 so much that he has bought a holiday home in the region and recently said in an interview : ‘ the genealogy shows i am descended from @entity15 , so i do have a bit of a stake in the country			1
’ @entity3 secretly bought the simple , white - washed property in the heritage site of @entity104 in 2005 with the help of the @entity106 , a @entity2 - based charity which works to preserve @entity13 's historic @entity108 villages from destruction , of which he is patron			1
he paid £ 18,000 for the three - bedroomed , 18th century farmhouse			0
@entity104 lies in a picturesque valley in the heart of @entity94 , north - west of @entity113 , and is comprised of men and women of mainly of @entity13 and gypsy origin			2
it has already won many of @entity7 's highest awards for cultural restoration and economic regeneration			2
@entity3 has visited the village several times and is so taken with the simplicity of local life that he holidays there each summer			0
he and his security team sleep in the traditional white - washed village house - complete with wooden truckle beds and outside toilets - and drink locally - pressed organic apple juice			0
the house is rented out to overseas tourists when the prince is not in residence			0
@entity46 last night confirmed the prince had a meeting with the @entity13 minister but declined to be drawn on the nature of their conversations			0
a spokesman did , however , say the prince was very fond of the country and pointed out that he already owned properties in the region			0
but senior royal sources have dismissed the speculation as ‘ ridiculous ’			0
passionate : @entity3 paid £ 18,000 for this property in the heritage site of @entity104 in 2005 , and has since holidayed there every year			1

@entity7 newspapers claim @entity3 could be anointed should monarchy be restored
@entity3 's ancestral links with @entity15 and @entity17 cited as reasons
@entity3 is passionate about the country and owns a holiday home in picturesque town of @entity104
