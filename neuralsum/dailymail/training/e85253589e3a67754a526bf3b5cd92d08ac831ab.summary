by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 10 october 2013 bubonic plague is sweeping through @entity4 and could lead to a full - blown epidemic , aid charities have warned			1
fears are growing that the deadly disease could spread through the prisons of the island nation , which are frequently infested with rats			2
last year , 60 people in @entity4 died from bubonic plague , more than in any other country in the world			1
disease : bubonic plague , carried by fleas like this one , is sweeping through @entity4 while the disease has been almost entirely eradicated from @entity19 , there were 256 cases of bubonic plague recorded in @entity4 last year			1
october is the start of the danger period for the disease as fleas which spread the plague thrive in the humid weather			1
the @entity27 and the @entity28 are now working in the country to prevent bubonic plague from becoming even more common , according to the @entity30			2
experts are particularly concerned about the prospect of an epidemic started in @entity4 's crowded and filthy prisons and then spreading when inmates are released or receive visitors			1
rats living in the prisons often carry fleas which transmit bubonic plague to humans by biting them			1
the disease can then escape to the outside world via staff , visitors , freed inmates or the rats themselves			0
idyllic : but @entity4 , pictured , is now the plague capital of the world with 256 cases last year ' if the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town , ' @entity51 of the @entity28 told the @entity30			1
' the prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town			0
' the @entity27 is working to eradicate the disease , but this is particularly difficult as it is necessary not only to kill the rats themselves but also to destroy the fleas living on them			0
although the disease can be cured by antibiotics , rural residents often do not have access to even basic healthcare and can be ashamed to seek treatment			0
one farmer told the @entity30 he had not been allowed to bury his daughter after she died of plague , as officials took her body into quarantine and buried it themselves			0
devastation : the @entity81 saw bodies piled up on carts dragged through the streets of @entity19 bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history , having killed around 100million people in the ' @entity81 ' which hit @entity19 in the 14th century			2
it is caused by a bacterium known as @entity92 , which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats			0
the disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin , armpits or neck , known as ' buboes '			0
it kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated , although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive			0
after the @entity81 arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in @entity19 , with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century			0
bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world , with 90 per cent of all cases now found in @entity117			1
however , there have been a few non-fatal cases in the @entity120 in recent years , while in august this year a 15 - year - old boy died in @entity122 after eating a groundhog infected with the disease .			2

@entity4 had 256 cases of bubonic plague last year with 60 deaths
