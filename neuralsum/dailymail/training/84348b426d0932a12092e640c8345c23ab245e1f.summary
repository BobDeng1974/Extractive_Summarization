by @entity0 published : 22:16 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 3 july 2013 pope @entity1 has cleared the final obstacle before being made a saint , awaiting just the final approval from @entity5 and a date for the ceremony that could come as soon as december 8 , a @entity9 official and news reports said @entity12 news agency reported that a commission of cardinals and bishops met tuesday to consider @entity1 's case and signed off on it			1
a @entity9 official confirmed that the decision had been taken some time back and that tuesday 's meeting was essentially a formality.one possible canonization date is december 8 , the feast of the @entity23 , a major feast day for the @entity25			1
this year the feast coincidentally falls on a sunday , which is when canonizations usually occur			0
sainthood imminent : pope @entity1 , seen here releasing doves from the window of his apartments in @entity9 in 2005 , will be made a saint as soon as december controversial : some of the @entity9 's problems , including sex abuse cover - ups and financial scandals , date from the time of @entity1 , leading to questions about his fitness for a sainthood the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized by the church to discuss saint - making cases on the record , confirmed reports in @entity50 newspaper that @entity1 could be canonized together with pope @entity51 , who called the @entity52 but died in 1963 before it was finished			1
there is reasoned precedent for beatifying or canonizing two popes together , primarily to balance one another out			0
@entity1 has been on the fast track for possible sainthood ever since his 2005 death , but there remains some concern that the process has been too quick			1
some of the @entity63 's deep - seated problems - clerical sex abuse , dysfunctional governance and more recently the financial scandals at the @entity9 bank - essentially date from shortcomings of his pontificate			0
@entity71 : pope @entity1 and @entity72 , who was beatified in 2003 , together in @entity73 in 1987 defenders of the fast - track process argue that people are canonized , not pontificates.but the @entity9 in the past has sought to balance concerns about papal saints by giving two the honor at the same time			2
such was the case in 2000 , when @entity1 beatified @entity51 , dubbed the ' good pope , ' alongside pope @entity83 , who was criticized by @entity84 for condoning the seizure of a @entity84 boy and allegedly referring to @entity84 as @entity87 canonizing @entity1 along with @entity51 , the @entity9 could be seeking to assuage concerns about @entity1 's fast - track sainthood case by tying it together with the 50 - year wait @entity51 has had to endure			1
spiritual leaders : pope @entity1 in 1986 in @entity92 with the @entity93 rites : pope @entity1 gives communion to a @entity97 woman in 1985 former leader of the @entity25 : @entity1 was born in @entity99 and became pope @entity1 at the age of 50 , in 1978 many @entity99 have been awaiting the final steps of @entity1 's progress , which has been pushed for by cardinal @entity103 , the @entity99 pope 's longtime private secretary			2
' we should be very happy if it is confirmed , ' @entity103 's spokesman , the reverend @entity105 told @entity110 television			0
' this is the next and the last step towards canonization			0
it will be presented to @entity5 and the pope will take the appropriate decision			2
' during @entity119 , chants of ' @entity118 ! ' or ' sainthood now ! ' erupted in @entity120			0
heeding the calls , then - pope @entity121 waived the typical five - year waiting period and allowed an investigation into @entity1 's life to begin immediately			1
the investigation determined that the beloved @entity99 - born pope lived a virtuous life , the first step in the sainthood @entity129 , the @entity9 determined that a @entity131 nun who prayed for his intercession was miraculously cured of @entity133			1
a second miracle is needed for canonization			0
the @entity9 has n't divulged any details about that second purported miracle .			0

a meeting of cardinals and bishops has signed off on the sainthood of @entity1 , whose *tenure* as @entity121 ended with his death in 2005
the last step is the final approval of @entity5 and a date for the ceremony which could be as soon as december 8
two miracles must be performed to rate a sainthood : the first of @entity1 was the curing of a nun of @entity133 after she prayed for his intercession ; his second has not been revealed as yet
