the @entity0 for solving a @entity1 in the fastest time has today been smashed by a robot			1
the @entity3 solved the cube in a speedy 3.253 seconds - much to the delight of spectators at the @entity7 , held at the @entity8 in @entity9			1
the robot 's record - breaking time beat the previous non-human record of 5.27 seconds - set by the machine 's predecessor , the @entity13 2			1
the machine today broke the @entity17 for the fastest solve ever with a time of 3.253 the robot 's record - breaking time beat the previous non-human record of 5.27 seconds , which was set by the machine 's predecessor , the @entity13 2 , over 18 months ago before that , the record stood at 10.69 seconds - achieved by a robot built by final year computing students at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 in 2011			1
the @entity3 was built over 18 months by engineer co-designers @entity29 and @entity30 who were working with technology company @entity31			0
the machine uses an @entity31 - powered @entity34 smartphone to analyze the cube and instruct four robotic hands to do move the elements of the cube			2
speaking before the challenge , @entity39 from @entity31 , said : ' we are very confident the robot will break the record			2
' the new robot can think three times faster than its older brother			0
the record - breaking attempt is a bit of fun for us			1
' our real focus is to demonstrate what can be achieved with readily - available technology to inspire young minds into taking a greater interest in science , technology , engineering and mathematics			0
' the @entity7 fair is an annual science , technology , engineering and maths event for young people aged between 7 and 19			2
the record attempt took place at the @entity7 - held at the @entity8 in @entity9 the robot uses uses a @entity70 smartphone ( pictured ) to analyze the cube and instruct four robotic hands to do move the elements of the cube single time : @entity75 of the @entity76 in march 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds at the @entity78 in @entity80 time : @entity81 at the @entity82 2013 with a 6.54 seconds average solve @entity84 - handed solving : a time of 9.03 seconds was made by @entity81 at the @entity87 solving : @entity88 solved a @entity1 with his feet in 27.93 seconds at the @entity90 2012			1
robot : @entity13 3 solved a @entity1 in 3.253 seconds - beating the @entity13 2 's record of 5.27 seconds			1
about 65,000 schoolchildren attend the event - with organisers hoping a variety of showcases , talks and events will inspire them to pursue a career in science and technology			0
the @entity7 also hosts the finals of the @entity104 - which rewards schoolchildren who have already excelled in science at school			1
the event is perhaps inspired - in its title at least - by the hit @entity111 comedy show @entity112 , which follows the lives and careers of a group of young , nerdy scientists			0
the @entity1 was invented in 1974 by @entity118 sculptor and professor of architecture @entity119			0
it was originally called the @entity1 , but was licensed by @entity119 to be sold by @entity121 in 1980			0
it is widely regarded as one of the best - selling toys of all time - having sold 350million units in 2010			0
the fastest human time to solve a cube was set in march last year by @entity75 of the @entity76 who completed the challenge in an impressive 5.55 seconds			1
amazingly , some talented fans can complete the cube with one hand - such as @entity81 who holds the single - handed completion record of 9.03 seconds			2
another top solver @entity88 can complete the toy with his feet in just 27.93 seconds			0
the fastest human to ever complete a cube - which was invented in 1974 by @entity118 sculptor @entity119 , is @entity75 of the @entity76 in march 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds			0
