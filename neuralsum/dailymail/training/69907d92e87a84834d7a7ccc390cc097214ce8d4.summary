by @entity0 the @entity2 woman who was impregnated five times by her father , an award - winning music video director , is writing a memoir about her childhood abuse			1
from the age of 10 , @entity8 ( now 35 ) was treated as a sex slave by her father @entity11 , a music - video director who won fame producing the @entity13 ' ' @entity15 ' music video			1
but after being convicted of abusing @entity8 and one of her sisters , @entity11 is now behind bars with a 90 - year sentence			1
despite being abused by her father , and treated like the other women by her mother , @entity8 has overcome her dark past and plans to put the whole thing behind her by publishing a memoir			1
her father started raping her at the age of 10 and she eventually went on to have four children out of incest ' the number one solution for ending something that is dark is to bring it to light , ' @entity8 said in a fundraising video			1
locked up : her father , @entity11 , now faces a combined 90 years in prison for the sexual abuses he committed against two of his daughters @entity8 recently started a campaign on @entity43 to raise 19,000 to self - publish her book , titled @entity45			1
it took her three years to write the 410 page manuscript about her polygamous family upbringing			2
she says she wants to share her story in order to ' raise awareness and lend a voice to those that are and have been abused '			0
the book is set to be published next june			0
@entity8 also recently won a $ 10,0000 college grant from @entity57 , a female empowerment organization			1
' many of the women that have received the grant have overcome enormous obstacles including poverty , sexual and domestic violence , the death of a spouse , and substance abuse , ' @entity59 said in an announcement			2
the grant will help @entity8 finish college			1
she is currently attending @entity74			0
last august , @entity8 shared the story of her tumultuous childhood with @entity77			2
her early life was relatively normal			0
she lived with her mother and father on the third - floor of an apartment in @entity83 , @entity2 , with her @entity85 immigrant grandparents living below			1
@entity8 was home - schooled but still allowed to play with the neighborhood children			1
when her family grew to include eight children they moved into a bigger apartment in the same building			2
double life : @entity8 's father became famous for directing the music video for @entity96 ' it was when @entity8 started to mature that her father started giving her unwanted attention			1
' he told me i was special			0
initially , it was to teach me to be a woman , ' she said			0
' by the time he started having intercourse with me , he was getting more and more violent			0
when i would start fighting him , he would hit me			0
it was more about threats			0
' her father began to change , and became more controlling over the family			2
he moved them out of their grandparent 's apartment to another house in @entity83 before relocating to @entity114 in @entity115			0
the children were only allowed to watch a small amount of tv , and nothing that depicted traditional family life			2
modern medicine was outlawed in the house , and he actually told his wife that his relations with @entity8 were to treat her eczema			2
getting her degree : @entity8 recently won a $ 10,000 scholarship to finish college from a female empowerment organization			1
she currently attends @entity74 @entity8 was n't the only one @entity11 was having sex with			1
he had a mistress - a @entity133 lawyer whom he had another two children with - and was also abusing one of @entity8 's sisters			1
he called himself a polygamist and a prophet			0
his family was allowed to pray to god but could only do so through him			0
' he said the world was going to end , and it was just going to be him and his offspring and that he was chosen , ' his ex-wife , @entity141 testified at a 2010 pre-trial hearing			0
she said he was attempting to create a ' pure ' bloodline by procreating with his daughters			0
when @entity8 's first child was born without defects , @entity11 took it as proof and continued to rape the girl to get her pregnant			1
damaging : @entity8 gave birth to five children by her father , and many of them inherited a rare genetic disorder due to inbreeding but the following children would not be so lucky			1
two further daughters born from her father would be diagnosed with phenylketonuria ( @entity162 ) a disease that prevents the body from breaking down amino acids			2
@entity162 can cause brain damage and seizures			0
dr. @entity168 , a @entity162 specialist who has treated @entity8 's children , said they definitely got the disease because of inbreeding			1
@entity162 is a recessive gene , so both parents must have the gene in order for it to pass along to the child			0
the gene only appears at a rate of 1 in 4,000 world wide and is much lower for african - americans			2
@entity180 's paternal grandfather had the gene			0
over the years , @entity8 became obsessed with escaping			1
she would sleep just because her dreams were better than real life			0
saved : when she was younger , @entity8 would dream of escaping her father			1
eventually she did when she brought her sick son to a hospital and triggered a social worker to step in ' i 'd dream about running away			2
i 'd dream about getting all my brothers and sisters â € ” one of my sisters was a baby , and i was taking care of her â € ” i 'd dream about growing breasts and getting milk and running away with them somewhere , ' she said			0
when she was older and one of her sons fell sick , she finally got the courage to take him to the hospital since @entity11 was out of town on a business trip			1
but she did n't know how to interact with the doctors and a social worker stepped in , alerting the @entity204			0
when @entity11 returned from his business trip he was enraged , and threatened to forcibly remove his son from the hospital			1
child services stepped in before he could do that and placed them in separate homes			0
ambition : in addition to attending school , @entity8 runs her own bakery business after that @entity8 , her mother and her sisters moved away from @entity11 as she attempted to get her children back			1
her performance in state - mandated courses and counseling impressed the government officials and eventually her children were returned to her			2
' she has been an exceptional mother , ' @entity168 said			0
' she was so attentive and patient , it 's remarkable			0
for a young girl - with all she 's had - she has been just wonderful			2
' having to fight to get her children back also empowered @entity8 , and translated to her life after abuse			2
she now lives in @entity227 , @entity2 with her husband			1
defects : when @entity8 's first child was born without defects , @entity11 took it as a sign that he was creating a ' pure ' bloodline she went back to school for her ged and will finish her liberal arts degree from @entity74 this fall			1
she also runs her own baking business and plans to start a restaurant someday			1
@entity8 and her sister decided to finally bring charges against their abusive father			1
they delayed pressing charges since they were unsure the affect it would have on the children			0
she shared her story in hopes of making a difference with those in a similar situation			0
' instead of just being an experience that i had , maybe this strengthened me			0
what does n't break us makes us stronger			0
