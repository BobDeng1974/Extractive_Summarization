@entity0 is to start selling a humanoid robot which can walk , climb , use tools and even drive a car			1
call @entity4 , the robot was developed by a @entity7 firm bought by @entity0			1
it recently won a military ' robo - olympics ' - but @entity0 has revealed the machine is being pulled from future rounds of the contest so it can be developed into the firm 's first commercial robot			1
during the recent ' robo olympics ' team @entity4 's machine carried out all eight rescue - themed tasks - including scaling a ladder , opening a door , removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile , taking 27 of a possible 32 points			1
@entity4 's 1.48m ( 4ft 11in ) tall , two - legged robot entered the contest the favourite and lived up to its reputation			2
it makes use of a new high - voltage liquid - cooled motor technology that uses a capacitor , rather a battery , for power			0
its engineers say this lets its arms move and pivot at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible , in effect giving it stronger ' muscles '			0

the announcement came as the next round of the robo - contest was revealed			2
' the first - place finisher , @entity64 , has elected to withdraw from the @entity65 to focus on the development of its first commercial product , ' organisers said			2
@entity69 will be the stage for the @entity71 ( @entity72 ) finals			2
teams from around the world will meet at @entity76 in @entity77 to compete for the $ 2 million prize to be awarded to the team that best demonstrates human - supervised robot technology for disaster response			0
the @entity72 is a competition of human - robot systems developed to help emergency personnel respond to natural and man - made disasters			0
participating teams from some of the most advanced robotics research and development organizations in the world are designing hardware , software , sensors , and human - machine control interfaces to be tested in a series of tasks selected by @entity71 for their broad relevance to disaster response operations			1
' six months ago at the @entity99 , we began physically testing human - supervised robots against disaster - relevant tasks			2
' their impressive performance gave us the confidence to raise the bar , ' said dr. @entity106 , @entity72 program manager			0
' a year from now at the @entity65 we will push the technology even further ' ' anything you can do , humans ! ' : @entity7 robot @entity4 completes one of the eight @entity71 challenges - climbing a steep ladder the robot developed by a @entity7 start - up that was recently acquired by @entity0 has left 15 rivals for dead at a two - day competition hosted by the @entity119 to see which machine could cope best in the event of a nuclear meltdown			1
@entity124 's machine carried out all eight rescue - themed tasks - including scaling a ladder , opening a door , removing debris and clearing debris - to outscore its rivals by a mechanical mile , taking 27 of a possible 32 points			1
however @entity135 's entry @entity133 , a $ 3 million creation , failed to score a single point , in an embarrassing blow to the @entity140 space station			0
the machine was seemingly designed to much in an astronaut sense , weighing a clunky 125kg , rather than being to help out in a crisis			0
@entity4 ' s closest competitor was @entity145 - which used the @entity0 / @entity147 robot - which scored 20 points			1
three of the other 15 teams that took part failed to secure any points at the event near @entity154 , @entity155 , with @entity135 one of them			0
the robot can also operate tolls - and is seen here closing a valve with a spanner clean - up : another task required clearing debris from an entry way			0
@entity71 said the motivated to do the competition are realizing how little robots were able to help during the @entity168 nuclear meltdown four countries took place in the competition - @entity140 , @entity7 , @entity171 and @entity172			1
@entity173 said it had been inspired to organise the challenge after it became clear robots were only capable of playing a very limited role in efforts to contain 2011 's @entity168 nuclear reactor meltdown in @entity7			1
' what we realised was ... these robots could n't do anything other than observe , ' said @entity106 , programme manager for the @entity71			1
' what they needed was a robot to go into that reactor building and shut off the valves			0
' in order to spur on development of more adept robots the agency challenged contestants to complete a series of tasks , with a time - limit of 30 minutes for each			2
among the challenges were driving a utility vehicle along a course , climb an 8ft - high ladder , remove debris blocking a doorwar and cut a triangular shape in a wall using a cordless drill			0
more than 100 teams originally applied to take part , and the number was whittled down to 17 by @entity173 ahead of friday and saturday 's event			1
@entity4 is also capable of opening a door			0
the two - legged humanoid out - mastered rivals by seven points the googlebot driving a car as part of the test some entered their own machines , while others made use of @entity224 - a robot manufactured by another @entity0 - owned business , @entity147 - controlling it with their own software			1
one self - funded team from @entity172 - @entity229 - dropped out at the last moment , bringing the number of contestants who took part at the @entity234 racetrack to 16			2
@entity237 's @entity236 the robots had to attach a hose pipe as one of their challenges the machine was developed by a spin - off from the @entity246 's @entity245 lab , which @entity0 recently revealed it had acquired			1
in case of an emergency , @entity4 unhooks a fire hose @entity0 's robot currently has power cables and tether attached - but future versions could be wireless the team scored 27 points out of a possible 32 , putting it seven points ahead of second - placed @entity145 , which used @entity224			1
scores were based on a system that awarded three points for completing a task 's primary objectives , and then a bonus point for doing so without any human intervention			0
@entity4 's robot behaved almost perfectly , but lost points because ' the wind blew a door out of their robot 's hold and because their robotic creation was not able to climb out of a vehicle after it successfully navigated an obstacle course , ' reported the @entity276			0
four countries took part in the @entity71 competition , including @entity140 , @entity171 , @entity172 and of course @entity7			1

machine has already won @entity173 ( @entity71 ) ' *robogames* '
the eight - part ' rescue challenge ' was inspired by the nuclear meltdown at @entity286 during the 2011 @entity7 *tsunami* , where it was realized robots could do very little to help
machine has now been pulled from contest so @entity0 can begin work on a commercial version of it
