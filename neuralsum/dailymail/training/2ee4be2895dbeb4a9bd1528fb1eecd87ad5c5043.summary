for 26 years , @entity0 trudged on through each day as her body broke down beneath her			1
it was n't until last year that the now 43 - year - old business owner , from @entity4 in @entity5 , was finally diagnosed with @entity6 by a doctor that was too afraid to treat her			2
' i had a lot of symptoms that were vague and would reappear and disappear for a bit - a lot of things that were n't quite right that i could n't put my finger on			0
then in 1994 i became so fatigued that i could n't leave my room or bed , ' ms @entity0 told @entity18			1
' it 's a debilitating fatigue , to the point where you have to make a choice of , " do i do my hair or have a shower ? because there 's no way i can do both if i have to get to work today "			0
she suffered from extreme fatigue and was eventually left unable to walk or speak for long periods of time about 300,000 @entity33 are estimated to be living with @entity6 , which occurs in humans who are bitten by ticks and insects that are infected with @entity38 bacteria ' i was told i had virus and that 's why i was so tired			1
i 'd seen between 12 to 17 doctors for various things that arose over the years and none of them picked it up			0
a lot of doctors kept saying that , because there was nothing in my blood – but they would just be checking my iron and sugar levels			0
' the @entity54 of @entity5 estimates that about 300,000 @entity33 are currently living with the bacteria borne illness			1
it occurs in humans who are bitten by ticks and insects that are infected with the @entity38 bacteria			0
@entity62 , the president of the association , told @entity18 that @entity6 is a ' hidden epidemic ' ; despite many @entity33 presenting symptoms , the illness continues to be dismissed by the government and medical practitioners across the country			1
' they have been having trouble isolating the organism in the lab and a very prestigious group did a big study in 1994 that did not find @entity38 in @entity33 ticks , and so a very blanket statement was made that there is no @entity38 in @entity5 , ' ms @entity62 said			1
many sufferers , like @entity79 , are referred to psychologists as the @entity33 government does not recognise that the infectious disease can be caught in @entity5 as a result , many @entity33 suffering from @entity6 , like ms vary , are told that their pain is all in their head			1
source : @entity54 of @entity5 ' they would ship me off to psychiatrists who just kept saying " i do n't know why they keep sending you to me " , ' she said			2
' you just start to realise , well actually medicine and doctors are n't any help to you and you just have to live as best you can			0
' similarly , @entity79 and @entity98 , from @entity99 , told @entity100 's sunday night how they were repeatedly turned away by medical practitioners who insisted mrs @entity79 's sudden seizures and inability to walk were due to a psychological problem			2
' the top neurologist in @entity99 said " it 's all in your head , go away " , ' mr @entity98 said			0
' it 's hard to have a nurse yell at your wife and say , " you 're making this up , stop shaking , " when you know that there 's something wrong , when you know that it 's not all in her head			1
' it was n't until may last year that mrs @entity79 , who was suffering 11 seizures a day and had been turned away by three doctors and three hospitals , found out that she had lyme disease when her blood was sent to the @entity121 for testing			1
with doctors in @entity5 unable to treat the illness as the testing methods and results are not officially recognised , patients like ms @entity0 and mrs @entity79 are being forced to travel as far as @entity129 to be treated			1
both women attended @entity132 hospital in @entity133 where they received scientifically unproven hypothermia treatment – a procedure in which an artificial fever is stimulated by heating the patient 's body to up to 41.7 degrees			0
after spending $ 55,000 on the controversial treatment , mrs @entity79 can not only walk again , but has resumed studying her nursing degree			2
ms @entity79 was left barely able to walk ( left ) and suddenly began suffering from intense seizures up to 11 times a day ( right ) ' it 's hard to have a nurse yell at your wife and say , " you 're making this up , stop shaking " when you know that there 's something wrong , when you know that it 's not all in her head , ' @entity98 , @entity79 's husband , said both ms @entity79 and ms vary were forced to travel to @entity129 to be treated			1
both women attended @entity132 hospital in @entity133 where they received scientifically unproven hypothermia treatment ( pictured ) – a procedure in which an artificial fever is stimulated by heating the patient 's body to up to 41.7 degrees ms vary , who has suffered from @entity6 since the age of 17 , has also noticed life changing improvements after undertaking multiple treatments at two different @entity129 clinics and another in @entity167			1
' i can stand up in a queue in a supermarket now - i could n't do that before i went to @entity129			2
i can walk now , i can do daily tasks , i could n't hold conversation for a long time , i had n't had an appetite for more than 10 years – that has returned , ' she said			2
' my ability to dream has come back , i have no more heart problems , there 's no pain in my fingers and hands or sensation of skin crawling , i even look better			0
people say to me " if i had a before and after photo , no one would believe i was the same person " , do n't look so sick any more			0
' after spending $ 55,000 on the controversial treatment , mrs @entity79 can not only walk again , but has resumed studying her nursing degree ms vary , who has suffered from @entity6 since the age of 17 , has also noticed life changing improvements after undertaking multiple treatments at two different @entity129 clinics and another in @entity167 but while their bodies continue to heal , the fight is not over , as @entity33 doctors continue to dismiss the possibility of @entity6 being caught in @entity5 as well as patient 's test results from overseas			1
@entity62 from the @entity54 of @entity5 is calling for the government and medical boards to ' recognise that patients are becoming sick from tick bites '			1
' most people are only getting confirmation that they have the disease from overseas from specialist lyme testing labs			0
those tests are being dismissed as inadequate in @entity5 because they are not @entity213 ( @entity214 , @entity5 ) accredited , ' she said			0
' there are only two labs in @entity5 that are accredited to test for @entity6 and those processes have discrepancies			2
' the chief medical officer found blood tests are relied upon but are unreliable			0
they get negative tests back and then blame patients and give them over to psychiatrist , but the research is n't up to scratch yet			0
an absence of evidence is not proof of absence			0

@entity0 suffered from @entity6 *undiagnosed* for 26 years
she was left unable to walk , suffered from extreme fatigue and was losing her ability to speak for long periods of time
ms @entity0 was forced to travel to @entity129 to seek treatment as the @entity33 government does not recognise it can be caught here
@entity79 also went to @entity129 for treatment after a test *conducted* overseas confirmed she had the disease
the nursing student , who suffered from up to 11 seizures a day and could n't walk , was told by a nurse : ' you 're making this up , stop shaking '
the @entity54 of @entity5 estimates 300,000 @entity33 are currently living with illness , which is usually *transferred* by ticks
