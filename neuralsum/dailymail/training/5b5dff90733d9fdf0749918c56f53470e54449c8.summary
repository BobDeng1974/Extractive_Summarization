this is the underground bare - knuckle boxing club where men risk bloody noses and broken bones for a shot at the $ 40,000 prize			1
the real - life @entity6 , which keeps moving locations , cropped up last in @entity9 , @entity10			1
organizers and competitors openly admit that the fights are illegal - but this does nothing to stop scores of spectators paying $ 100 for a ticket to watch the carnage and gamble on the outcome			1
combat takes place in a ring on the ground marked by masking tape			0
the only rules are that biting , kicking and holds are banned , and that it is illegal to attack an opponent who is on the floor			1
@entity50 , 50 , who has appeared on the @entity51 , is the nephew of a @entity53 gangster			2
he himself has served jail time for racketeering			0
he told the paper he has been organizing fights around @entity10 for as many as a dozen years without alerting the authorities			1
but a match from this spring was filmed for an episode of investigative cable show 60 minutes sports , unveiling one of the brutal fights			1
heads down : then men go toe - to - toe , or closer , in the unlicensed bouts , which could attract hefty penalties should the law get involved fans : spectators pay $ 100 a piece to get inside the bout - and from there can place wagers on fighters location : one of the bouts took place upstairs in this warehouse , above a car repair shop - but the building 's owner is n't keen for a repeat performance in the footage @entity84 , a retired @entity85 boxer , takes to the ring and walks away with $ 40,000 in prize money			1
the fighting bears some resemblance to the 1999 @entity92 film @entity6			0
though clearly the oft - touted ' first rule ' that the club be kept an absolute secret is not adhered to			0
a perhaps accidental similarity is that the @entity97 where the fights now take place shares a name with @entity41 , @entity101 - which was the real - life filming location for parts of the film			1
@entity50 said that the bouts have been unveiled in a bid to make his enterprise legitimate			2
he claims to be in discussion with state authorities - though he would not say which one - to get a permit for the fights			0
according to @entity10 state laws , any unlicensed ' combative fighting ' event carries risks of prosecution for all those involved			2
anyone who fights , as well promoters , organizers , judges and referees are liable , and could be hit with $ 1,000 fines for violations			2
friendly start : two men bump fists before doing their best to knock one another out unhappy finish : one brawler was left cut and bloodied after his time in the ring was over one neighbor told the news journal : ' it 's kind of odd that you live here and do n't even know something like that is going on , ' she says			0
' it 's a problem just waiting to happen			0
' the fight filmed for 60 minutes sports was held in an empty room above @entity145 , a car repair shop			0
the owner let for his part , @entity145 's @entity148 says he agreed to let the fights be held at his business after a friend called asking for a favor because the first location fell through			0
he says the night was more of a hassle than he anticipated with spectators having to walk through his showroom to use his bathrooms , passing @entity159 and @entity160 under the watchful eye of @entity148 's employees			0
the owner @entity50 use the space as a favor - but says the event was so much hassle that he would n't agree to it again			2
inspiration : the above frame shows @entity92 starring in the 1999 film @entity6 , which seems to have been replicated in @entity10 links : oddly , @entity6 was partly filmed in the city of @entity41 - albeit @entity41 , @entity101			1

brutal bout was filmed in @entity41 , @entity10 , earlier this year
*winner* - a former pro boxer from @entity85 - walked away with $ 40,000
only rules in bouts are no holds , kicking or biting
organizer @entity50 says he wants to streaming fights live online
unlicensed combat events are illegal in @entity10 and can attract fines
