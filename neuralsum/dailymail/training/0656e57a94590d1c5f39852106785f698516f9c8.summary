prince @entity0 has secretly lobbied the health secretary to back discredited homeopathic medicines			1
the @entity0 and @entity3 – both strong supporters of alternative therapies – held a meeting at @entity7 last week			1
homeopathy and alternative medicines were on the agenda , according to well - placed sources			1
the @entity12 already spends millions each year on alternative medicines , at a time when it is restricting life - saving drugs for those with cancer			1
the prince , who has long been accused of meddling in government policy , has found a fellow supporter in homeopathy in health secretary @entity3 ( left ) - and they met last week to discuss it @entity0 is understood to be unhappy that government plans to set up a register of practitioners of herbal and @entity28 medicine – designed to give them an element of respectability – have stalled			1
but a @entity32 mp accused the prince of promoting ‘ voodoo medicine ’ and both the @entity34 and the commons science and technology committee say the @entity12 should stop funding homeopathic treatments because of a lack of evidence they work			2
the @entity34 has described homeopathy as ‘ witchcraft ’ , and two weeks ago the @entity42 said homeopaths were putting people ’s lives at risk by discouraging them from seeking medical treatment			2
despite this , mr @entity3 has been outspoken in his support for homeopathy			1
in 2007 he signed a @entity51 motion welcoming the ‘ positive contribution made to the health of the nation by the @entity12 homeopathic hospitals ’			0
he has also defended it in a letter to a constituent			0
the prince has long been accused of meddling in government policy			2
the @entity0 with some homeopathic remedies in @entity62 , @entity63 in 2004 it emerged in 2009 that he had written to eight @entity66 departments in three years			1
just this month , the @entity67 blocked @entity69 requests for the letters to be published			0
@entity32 mp @entity71 said that by promoting ‘ voodoo medicine ’ , @entity0 was putting himself in a ‘ very dangerous position ’ because as monarch he will have to be impartial			1
‘ the head of state , which he will soon be , has to remain above controversy			0
the only serious job of a head of state is to be above policy , ’ mr @entity71 said			0
‘ if he wishes to lobby ministers , he should stand for @entity82 or join a lobbying firm , but he should not be using his position as heir to the throne to do it			0
the @entity42 's assessment of treatments and claims made by the @entity90 suggested practitioners were offering false hope ‘ there is a danger here for the future of the monarchy , and we have already been denied access to 27 letters he has sent to ministers because they might affect his position as king			2
‘ if there is any doubt over his suitability to be king , we should know about it			0
‘ what is worrying is that homeopathy is a completely unscientific form of medicine – it ’s voodoo medicine			1
the pills contain not a single atom of medicine			2
the health secretary should be concentrating on science - based medicine that actually works			1
’ in 2010 , the then @entity32 health minister @entity122 confirmed that prince @entity0 had brought up homeopathy in meetings with @entity124 , who was then health secretary			1
of @entity0 ’s meeting with mr @entity3 , @entity7 said : ‘ as confirmed in the court circular , the @entity0 received the secretary of state for health last week			1
‘ the prince meets government ministers from time to time in his role as heir to the throne as well as @entity133 and this was one of those meetings			2
there was no specific agenda and a wide range of topics were discussed			0
’ the @entity139 would not confirm what was discussed			0
but on the issue of the register of herbal medicines , a spokesman said : ‘ the regulation of herbalists and traditional @entity28 medicine practitioners has been a matter of debate for over ten years			1
‘ in february 2011 we announced our intention to regulate these practitioners , and since that time we have been working through the issues involved			2
‘ as a result of the complexity of the outstanding issues , a working group is being established to consider matters relating to patient protection when using unlicensed manufactured herbal products , increasing the use of herbal product licensing to minimise risk to consumers , and to consider how best to ensure these products do not cause harm to consumers			2
the @entity90 ' website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments ‘ we must make sure that whatever approach is taken addresses any potential risks to consumers as well as the needs of practitioners			1
’ earlier this month , advertising watchdogs ruled that practitioners of homeopathy were putting patients at risk by discouraging them from seeking essential medical treatment			1
the @entity42 ’s assessment of treatments and claims made by the @entity90 suggested practitioners were offering false hope and may be causing real harm			0
the society ’s website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments			0
but the @entity42 tested a series of statements and found there was insufficient evidence to support the claimed benefits			0
it said several conditions – including bronchitis , osteoarthritis and vertigo – required medical supervision and patients should not rely on homeopathy			0
evidence supplied by the society to support its claims was not strong enough and ‘ misleading ’			0
the @entity42 warned the society to stop making claims that are not supported by good evidence			0
society chairman @entity212 insisted that evidence did exist for the benefits of homeopathy , but that the society was prepared to change the way it marketed treatments .			0
