there 's a graceful giraffe , a brightly coloured dragonfly and a spider that 's far from itsy bitsy			1
at first glance , they all look like wonders from the animal kingdom			0
but look a little closer and you 'll spot a woman 's hand here , her foot poking out there , or the outline of her torso twisted into an extraordinary pose			2
for these remarkable images were all created by ' body concept artist ' @entity19 - with a little help from a couple of contortionists who acted as her human ' canvas '			1
she lines them up and draws composition marks on their bodies to make the images perfect blink and you 'll miss it ! one of the talented contortionists is transformed by @entity40 into a glittering , multi-coloured dragonfly here 's looking at you ! the eyes on this crab are shining out of the shoulder blades of miss @entity19 's model			1
the 27 - year - old from @entity48 used to run a hair and beauty salon , and began honing her unusual craft three years ago			1
now her pictures are known worldwide protected modesty : contortionists @entity55 and @entity56 wear white leotards against a white background to finish the effect the stuff of nightmares : you would n't want this giant tarantula under your bed - no matter how elegantly it was painted miss @entity19 , 27 , of @entity48 , has been perfecting her unusual art for three years after previously running a hair and beauty salon			1
each of the images in her ' @entity70 , which also include a seahorse , mandrill , zebra and crab , took between four and six hours to create from start to finish			1
first the contortionists , @entity55 and @entity56 , who wore leotards to protect their modesty , got into the required pose so miss @entity19 could draw compositional marks on their bodies			2
these acted as a guide to ensure her paintings would turn out to be the optical illusions she desires			0
some of the poses were so difficult they could only be held for minutes at a time			0
but thankfully for @entity90 and miss @entity56 , they did not have to hold their poses throughout the painting process - the vast majority was done in more comfortable positions , often lying down			0
if i could talk to the animals : the models take their work very seriously , even when dressing up as a highly convincing mandrill monkey thoughtful : miss @entity19 said the art reminds her of ' the remarkable ways animals have evolved to survive in their surroundings ' the artist in her studio : it takes great patience , talent and upper body strength to find the west @entity111 mandrill in @entity48 almost there ! the contortionist has a rare chance to relax as @entity19 and her assistants put the finishing touches to the crab 's face the process begins : one of @entity19 's models takes the position for the crab portrait against a bright white background careful work : @entity19 then paints white lines on the models ' bodies to help with her composition so they can relax again later patience : once the structure of the animal is in place , miss @entity19 can check it 's worked , then paint the rest using a sponge and brush miss @entity19 used a brush and sponge to apply the water - based paints to their bodies			1
once the painting was completed , it was then just a case of the contortionist resuming the requisite pose so a photograph could be taken of the finished artwork against a white background			0
miss @entity19 , who sells prints of her animal creations , said : ' the photograph is pretty much the last five minutes of the whole process - then @entity55 and @entity56 are free to go home and have a well - deserved shower			2
' the photographs always get a briliant response			0
people love the optical illusion aspect of it			0
' for me , it 's kind of exploration of evolution - a study of the remarkable things humans can do with their bodies and the remarkable ways animals have evolved to survive in their surroundings			2
' i consider them pieces of art , not body painting			0
' concept and design : @entity19 ; model : @entity55 ; assistants : @entity176 , @entity177 ; photography : @entity179 prepare to scare : @entity56 gets into position after being painted as a giant tarantula in artist @entity19 's studio in @entity48 talent : the body paint takes many hours to apply , and the colours are chosen carefully to match those of the intended animals finishing touches : miss @entity19 's work , including the giant tarantula , has been shared around the world by those who marvel at the illusions into the coccoon : the beginnings of one contortionist 's transformation into a bright , glittering dragonfly in miss @entity19 's studio painstaking : as the model holds the uncomfortable position , artist @entity40 uses water paints and a picture booklet as a guide why so serious ? creating a dragonfly is no easy task - it takes a steady hand and some careful detailing on the contortionist 's skin the magician 's secrets : panning back out on the scene , the dragonfly almost complete , shows not a forest but a well - furnished studio			1

@entity19 , 27 , from @entity48 , began performing her *elaborate* trick after running a hair and beauty salon
she spends up to six hours working up each creation with water - based paint and two very patient contortionists
the art painted on the women 's white leotards include a zebra , mandrill , seahorse , giraffe , dragonfly and spider
