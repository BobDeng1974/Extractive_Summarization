by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 3 january 2013 councils are trying to cover up the number of taxpayer - subsidised homes they are handing to foreigners , it was claimed yesterday			1
local authorities have stopped giving figures for how many houses and flats they have given to foreign citizens amid rising worries over the impacts of immigration , a report said			2
councils in @entity18 , where one in five publicly - financed homes are already known to be occupied by foreigners , are among those no longer supplying the figures			1
refusal : local authorities have stopped giving figures for how many houses and flats they have given to foreign citizens amid rising worries over the impacts of immigration , a report said now mps have called for an inquiry into the suppression of information on who gets council and housing association homes			1
@entity37 ’s @entity36 and @entity39 @entity38 said in a statement on behalf of the cross-party @entity42 group : ‘ this is a huge issue for many people			0
‘ the government must now launch a full inquiry into what is going on in the allocation of social housing in @entity18			2
’ the way subsidised homes have been going to foreign citizens and not to families with long - standing local connections has become politically sensitive as immigration hits record levels and the recession has undermined ordinary people ’s ability to afford to buy or rent private homes			0
under @entity62 ’s government , senior @entity29 complained the way in which local families in @entity18 had failed to get public housing while new migrants succeeded had swelled support for the @entity68			1
last year ministers acknowledged that a fifth of the nearly 800,000 publicly - owned homes in @entity18 are occupied by families and individuals who are citizens of other countries and not of @entity75			1
outrage : mps @entity36 , left , and @entity38 , right , are among those calling for the government to launch an inquiry into the issue of council housing the report from the @entity84 think tank said that local authorities in @entity18 are now disclosing the nationality of new tenants for fewer than half the homes they let			1
four authorities – @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 – have declined to take part in the government ’s count of social housing lettings even though it is a legal requirement for them to do so			0
two more councils , @entity101 and @entity102 , where there are high numbers of foreign citizens in social housing , have obscured their latest figures by claiming high numbers of tenants refuse to say what their nationality is			0
the report said that since waiting lists for social housing are ten times longer than the number of homes made available each year , only a small proportion of families that ask will ever get a house from a council or a housing association			1
huge stock : councils in @entity18 let 404,000 houses and flats while state - subsidised housing associations ( file picture ) @entity84 added : ‘ it is important to be clear that the debate should be about foreign nationals , not people who are foreign born , who should be treated like any other @entity75 citizen			2
’ its chairman sir @entity132 said : ‘ it is deeply unsatisfactory that the information on new lets should be so chaotic given the huge importance of this issue to so many families			0
the government must make the nationality question compulsory			0
this could provide the basis for a renewed debate on the criteria by which social housing should be allocated			0
’ coalition ministers have made some changes to social housing allocation rules since 2010 , with the aim of giving a greater claim to families with close connections to a local area			0
councils in @entity18 let 404,000 houses and flats while state - subsidised housing associations , which do declare the nationality of tenants , have 376,000			2
before the recession @entity159 calculations said that the cost to taxpayers of each socially - owned house or flat was on average £ 62,000			1
the figure suggests social housing in @entity18 has cost taxpayers almost £ 50billion .			0
