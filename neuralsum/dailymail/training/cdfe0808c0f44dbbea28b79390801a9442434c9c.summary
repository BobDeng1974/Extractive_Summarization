the @entity5 presenter says women will never have the expertise men have in the animal kingdom , it ’s common to find gender roles clearly defined between male and female			1
and the world of tv wildlife presenters is no different , according to veteran @entity5 host @entity1			1
insisting ‘ you ca n’t fight stereotypes ’ , the @entity16 star says her male co-stars take on the role of expert – while women are simply there as ‘ enthusiasts ’			1
risking the wrath of feminists , the 47 - year - old claimed men are ‘ wired ’ differently , making it easier for them to learn the names and categories of animal species			1
women , meanwhile , care about ‘ emotional problems ’ , she says			1
as one of tv ’s best - known female presenters , miss @entity1 returns to screens on october 29 for the new series of the @entity40 wildlife show alongside @entity41 , 52 , and 57 - year - old @entity42			1
she said : ‘ @entity41 ’s knowledge is phenomenal			0
i ’m not anywhere near as knowledgeable as him , particularly on birds			0
i remember when i took the role on			0
i have enthusiasm and interest , but not the knowledge that @entity41 does			0
‘ some people might say it ’s a shame that it ’s a female role that ’s like that , but it ’s very representative of people who are interested in wildlife			2
@entity41 and i have spoken about it often			0
‘ if you look at birders , 90 per cent are men , 10 per cent are women			2
it ’s the way we ’re wired			0
women would like to know the emotions of a bird rather than its name and what category it goes in			2
sometimes you ca n’t fight stereotypes			1
‘ women have their strengths and weaknesses			2
men are very different , and have theirs			0
’ miss @entity1 said women are far more likely to be experts in scientific fields that involve the study of emotional problems rather than hard facts			1
she added : ‘ far more women do primates than men			2
far more women run orphanages and rehabilitation centres because we ’re probably better at it			0
i am being stereotypical , but stereotypes are there because they are an average			0

but miss @entity1 – who took over her roles on @entity16 and @entity16 in 2011 – defended female presenters who focus on their looks			1
she said : ‘ it ’s not very easy to do light entertainment , read off an autocue and make it work			0
‘ just think of the number of people who have tried and failed			0
‘ people should n’t be so critical of people who are good looking on tv			0
