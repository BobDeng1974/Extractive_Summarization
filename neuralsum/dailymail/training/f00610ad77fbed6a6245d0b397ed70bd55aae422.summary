@entity1 police are being accused of embellishing the case against a father whose son died in a hot car last month after significant discrepancies allegedly emerged during a review of the evidence			1
the @entity9 has carefully looked through some the evidence , including a surveillance video that captured @entity12 outside the @entity13 where he worked , and the newspaper claims authorities overstated some of their case at a july 3 hearing			1
according to the @entity9 , the tape contradicts some of the testimony given by @entity22 detective @entity21			1
also , in an exclusive interview , @entity12 ' brother told the paper that he and @entity12 were planning a cruise together and that @entity12 had specifically requested one with facilities for children			1
@entity38 reiterated this during closing arguments , saying ' that morning , he waits 30 seconds in that car ... 30 seconds with that child right beside him			2

while the tape does show @entity12 pass a man in the parking lot , and pause briefly , his eyes are on his cell phone , which he is poking at with his free hand and he does n't appear to notice the man at all			1
the man in fact walks the length of @entity12 ' parked car and would have almost certainly seen the child if he 'd turned his head , the @entity9 claims			1
