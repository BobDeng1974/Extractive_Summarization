by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:09 pm on 3rd december 2011 foul - mouthed parents launched a bitter tirade at grotto staff dressed as @entity6 's elves and fairies in front of their children when a @entity11 deal turned sour at the weekend			1
more than 2,000 families turned up to last weekend 's @entity13 in @entity14 clutching a voucher from the discount website promising a magical @entity18 train ride at the grotto			1
but the atmosphere turned nasty when staff , decked out in festive fancy dress , were verbally abused after informing families that the website had got it wrong and that there was in fact no train ride			1
@entity18 is n't cheerful : staff at the grotto in @entity14 had to face foul - mouthed parents			1
from left , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 voucher blunder : @entity11 are at the centre of claims they issued false information tempting 2,000 families to travel to @entity14 for a @entity6 's grotto train ride that did n't exist as queues grew so long outside the grotto that children could n't get in , tempers frayed and parents started to shout and swear at overwhelmed grotto staff			1
tearful and crying children watched while parents shouted at staff forcing one elf to quit and a woman dressed as a christmas tree to complain that she had been targeted for abuse			1
grotto organiser @entity54 said : ' one man even verbally threatened the lady who is dressed as a christmas tree			1
' one of the elves was so upset that she has resigned			0
it was a complete nightmare			0
children were crying and upset			2
' abuse : staff in fancy dress had to endue abuse from angry parents at @entity6 's grotto in @entity14 all dressed up : but staff at the @entity14 winter wonderland were abused at the weekend by angry parents who thought they had a voucher guaranteeing a train ride she added that most of the abusive parents had travelled from @entity75 during last weekend 's popular @entity18 market in the picturesque city			1
the grotto was only able to handle 40 children an hour , she said and explained that dedicated staff had worked beyond their normal hours and without breaks to try to ensure excited children did not miss out			1
@entity54 had initially been contacted by @entity11 and agreed to use its services to help publicise the grotto , but she claimed she had never signed a contract and did not say there would be a train ride			1
she thought that the @entity14 grotto , which runs in @entity14 's winter wonderland until @entity92 , might have been mixed up with a grotto she ran in @entity94 , where there was a train ride			1
a @entity11 spokesman said : ' owing to a technical error , we apologise that the picture and wording used in this promotion may have indicated that a train ride was available at @entity104 when this was n't the case			2
we regret any disappointment this may have caused			0
' although advanced booking is not essential , preferred time slots can not be guaranteed without prior booking and are subject to availability			0
we hope that this has n't taken away from the @entity6 's grotto experience and we wish everyone a happy holiday season			2
' the website said it had corrected the promotion as soon as it discovered the error and had yesterday sent out a bulk email clarifying what was included in the promotion for customers that were yet to redeem their vouchers			0
@entity11 is an international organisation which uses collective buying power to offer huge discounts on things to do , eat , see and buy			0
recipe for disaster : @entity130 had to draft in 25 staff as demand surged for her cupcakes but it has run into controversy in the past few weeks with companies claiming that they have been unaware of the impact the deals can have on their businesses			0
last month baker @entity130 , from @entity140 , near @entity141 , told how , who normally makes 100 cupcakes a month , found herself having to bake an astonishing 102,000 after posting an offer on @entity11			0
disastrously , because the 50 - year - old 's deal had been so generous and the demand so huge , she made a loss on every order â€“ wiping out her profits for the entire year			2
and yesterday the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) launched an investigation into @entity11 after regulators complained the daily deals website broke advertising regulations on almost 50 occasions since the start of the year			0
the company debuted on the @entity160 stock exchange last month and , after an early rise , slumped below $ 20 on concern about competition from rival @entity164 and how the @entity166 debt crisis might affect overseas growth			0
however , @entity11 released strong early holiday sales numbers this week and executives said international growth remains strong			0
@entity11 shares rose more than 7 per cent to an intraday high of $ 20.82 on friday			0
the stock was up 5.5 per cent to $ 20 in late - morning trading .			2
