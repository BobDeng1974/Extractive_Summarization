surfing was virtually non-existent in @entity1 when @entity2 first traveled to the ' ultra-conservative ' country in 2010			1
the @entity6 surfer expected to face anger and disapproval in the @entity10 nation where televising female sports is forbidden			0
just last year , a woman was jailed simply for watching a men 's volleyball match			0
but the 29 - year - old was shocked to discover a welcoming country as eager to learn the sport as she was to teach them			2
overwhelmed by the reaction she returned three years later with filmmaker @entity21 and two female @entity1 athletes - professional snowboarder @entity23 and diver @entity24			1
@entity21 's documentary ' @entity26 ' charts their incredible journey to the shores of @entity29 , an area considered so deadly ' even @entity1 do n't go there '			1
' so when i screened my film in the capital , people were saying we did n't know you could go to @entity29 and come back alive			1
' despite its fearsome reputation as a site of brutal secular fighting between @entity82 and @entity81 , there is little alternative to the region 's 60 - mile stretch of sand and five foot waves			1
for the country 's surf - obsessed , it is becoming a necessary pilgrimage			2
a large crowd began to gather during @entity61 and @entity24 's first lesson under @entity37 's expert guidance			2
they predicted some opposition in the remote section of a largely male - dominated country , but the locals in @entity99 were simply intrigued			0
women are allowed to wear bathing suits in @entity1 's female - only swimming pools and baths , but traditional head - coverings are mandatory on public beaches where men are present			1
hundreds stormed the beach to watch the three women riding the waves in their wet - suits and hijabs			2
and soon the @entity51 locals were begging to take part themselves			0
the growth of the sport means ' @entity51 girls and women are no longer on the sidelines ' according to @entity37 , a five - time national champion in her native @entity121			2
she added : ' fathers are asking me to take their daughters surfing			0
' what is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here , with the young women playing an important change - making role , leading the way in a new frontier sport , writing a new narrative full of possibility despite being ignored by the world outside and limited by the constraints of their own country			0
' parting gift : @entity37 ( pictured ) presented her surfboard to local lawmaker @entity141 , who said : ' it ( sport ) is not just for men , women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors ' causing a stir : hundreds of local @entity51 people gathered for a surfing lesson from @entity2 leading the way : @entity2 ( pictured ) said : ' what is most inspiring is the enthusiasm and vision of young people here ' going pro : @entity159 rides a wave on the beach in @entity29 , considered one of the most dangerous places in @entity1 @entity1 hospitality : @entity2 ( top right ) and her two students @entity23 ( centre ) and diver @entity24 ( left ) were invited to dine with a local @entity51 family but her first surf with @entity61 and @entity24 caused quite a stir and when the village elders and a ' powerful ' member of parliament requested to meet them @entity37 expected the worst			1
she was again overwhelmed by the tolerance shown by @entity141 , who said : ' @entity174 recommends sports , which are beneficial both physically and spiritually			0
it is not just for men , women can do sports too with the hijab and female instructors			0
' we will ask female instructors to teach women this sport so they can benefit from this art. ' the ' thumbs up ' from the community 's senior figures mirrored the government 's acceptance when they allowed for @entity21 's film to be screened at the @entity193 last year			1
it had such a wide - reaching impact she 's now involved in a bid to launch the country 's first female surfing federation			1
she said : ' hopefully we can organise an international event in the future and convince more @entity1 to come with us ... but we do n't know when it 's going to happen because the administration is tricky			2
' the sport 's growing popularity has surprised @entity37 , who ' never could have imagined ' a religiously devout nation could adopt such a progressive sport into their hearts			2
@entity211 hit : @entity21 's film ' into the sea ' ( pictured ) was screened at the @entity214 last year change : the film was received wonderfully by critics after being screened in a country where even televising female sports is forbidden she says during ' into the sea ' : ' i came here three years ago and there was nobody surfing and now look at it			1
more and more people are on the beach every day - boys , girls , everyone joining in			0
' people say surfing is a selfish pursuit , it becomes kind of like an addiction and all you care about is finding the next perfect wave , but i really do n't believe that anymore			0
' i think the most powerful thing about surfing is being able to share that passion and connecting people			0
' @entity21 added : ' it was very exciting the last day , half the village came to watch the girls surf and the kids were very enthusiastic			1
' a lot of them were very shy at first , but by the time we got into the water , that was gone			0
' it really breaks down the barriers when we go into the water , it 's totally different from the beach			0
it makes people forget about the rules			0
' inspired by their own success , @entity37 and @entity21 also set up the non-profit @entity261			1
in its own words , the charity ' uses surfing as a medium for empowerment , transforming the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society , especially women and girls '			0
through their first project @entity271 , they are trying to establish surfing in @entity29 through the donation of equipment , formal lessons and workshops on how to build and create surfboards			1
the two women also created the ' we surf in @entity1 ' group within the local community in @entity29			1
now , @entity1 travel from all over the country to get lessons in the region they were once afraid of			1
you can watch the film 's trailer here			0
