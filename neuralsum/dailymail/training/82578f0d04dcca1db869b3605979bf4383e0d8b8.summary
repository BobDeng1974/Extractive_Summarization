sending signals : @entity1 will release emails and an e-book to give voters an insight into his beliefs in the clearest sign yet that he plans to run for president @entity1 is releasing 250,000 emails and an e-book in the clearest signal yet that he plans to run for president			1
the news comes after @entity1 , 61 , revealed he will announce his plans to run or not ' in short order '			1
but first he wants to ' let people make up their mind ' by making vast swathes of his work files public at the beginning of 2015			1
the former @entity21 governor , @entity22 's younger brother , insists the release will offer a candid insight into his beliefs and ideals because he ' was digital before digital was cool '			1
he cryptically described the documents as containing ' some funny ones ... some sad ones ... some serious ones '			0
' one of the things i am going to do as i go through this process is release all of my e-mails and write an e-book , which has been kind of fun to go back and to think about this , and remind myself that if you run with big ideas and then you 're true to those ideas , and get a chance to serve and implement them and do it with passion and conviction , you can move the needle , ' @entity1 told @entity47 's @entity46			1
' and that 's what we need right now in @entity51			0
' his words came in a wide - reaching interview that addressed his criticism of president @entity57 's immigration plans			2
earlier this month , the younger @entity1 said he will make up his mind on whether to follow his father and brother into the @entity61 based on whether he can ' lift people 's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex ' , and whether ' the sacrifice for my family is tolerable '			1
he said : ' i 'm thinking about running for president			0
and i 'll make up my mind in short order - not that far out in the future			1
' ' i do n't know if i 'd be a good candidate or a bad one , ' @entity1 continued			2
' i kind of know how a @entity72 can win , whether it 's me or somebody else , and it has to be much more uplifting , much more positive , much more willing to be practical ... '			0
@entity1 , who is the son of one former president and brother of another , also blasted @entity57 's immigration order for going ' way beyond ' what other presidents have done			1
he reiterated his support for a pathway to legal status for those immigrants who are in the @entity51 illegally			0
but he said @entity57 may have exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally lifting the threat of deportation from millions of such immigrants last month			0
' the idea that , well , @entity91 did it , my dad did it - they did it on a much smaller scale and they did it with consent of @entity98			0
there are a lot of differences , ' @entity1 said on december 1 at the @entity103 's ceo council , an invitation - only event in @entity106 featuring some of the nation 's most powerful @entity107			1
speaking publicly about the order for the first time , @entity1 said @entity57 's move ' makes it harder ' for @entity98 to adopt lasting immigration reform			1
' it 's a shame , ' he added			0
the former @entity21 governor is seen as the early favorite of business - minded @entity72 eager to reclaim the @entity61 in 2016			1
' what @entity51 needs right now ' : @entity1 , younger brother of @entity22 , branded @entity57 hesitant and indecisive while he would be a force in the @entity72 presidential primary , @entity1 would face criticism from the party 's conservative wing unhappy with his positions on immigration and education reform			2
those who attended the event , however , include many political donors and @entity72 business leaders who support a more forgiving immigration policy			0
@entity1 was seen chatting with @entity133 head @entity132 , who has urged lawmakers to adopt a pathway to legal status for immigrants who are in the country illegally			2
two of the last three @entity72 presidents - @entity91 and @entity1 's father , @entity140 - also extended amnesty to family members of immigrants who were not covered by the last major overhaul of immigration law in 1986			1
@entity57 's executive order has drawn a withering response from @entity72 , but also has laid bare divisions within the @entity72 over how to deal with immigration			0
the issue is seen as critical for the @entity72 ahead of the 2016 presidential contest as party officials work to attract more @entity153 voters			0
the comments come as @entity1 works this week to keep his public profile high			2
@entity1 ( right ) hugs his brother former president @entity22 at a @entity72 campaign event earlier in the day , he attended a @entity159 fundraiser for @entity72 @entity161 hopeful @entity160 , less than a week before @entity160 faces incumbent @entity163 senator @entity162 of @entity164 in a runoff election that could increase the @entity72 's new majority			2
@entity1 , whose wife is @entity168 , told the ceo council that he supports a nation in which people ultimately find no need to identify their cultural origin			2
' that is the @entity51 we should aspire to - not the one where we 're dividing ourselves up to find where we are different , ' he said			0
' but the fact that you 're from a different place or you 've got a different origin is totally irrelevant			0

@entity1 wants to ' let people make up their mind ' about *potential* *nomination*
61 - year - old claims emails will give candid insight into his belief *system*
former @entity21 governor will decide ' in short order ' if he will run in 2016
he said it would depend on whether ' the sacrifice for my family is tolerable '
