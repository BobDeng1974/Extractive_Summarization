a motorcyclist recorded the terrifying moment he veered off @entity3 's most dangerous road and tumbled down a 40 - foot cliff - before escaping with only minor injuries			1
@entity6 , 21 , was riding his 600cc @entity8 along a notorious stretch of the @entity10 in the @entity11 when it slewed out of control and veered off the road			1
a camera fitted to his helmet captured mr @entity6 's view as he was thrown off his machine and repeatedly somersaulted down the hill			1
he cheated death with just mild concussion and a cut hand - caused when he grabbed some barbed wire as he walked to safety			1
the motorbike , which stopped at the top of the ridge , was written off and is being sold off for parts			2
now @entity6 ’s brush with death has become an internet sensation after he posted the video of the 60 mph near - miss on @entity45 , where it has gathered more than 100,000 views			1
mr @entity6 , an engineer from @entity48 , @entity49 , said : ' i ca n’t believe i walked out of that , not even with a broken bone			1
' when i went over the ridge i was like helicopter spinning			2
i thought , this is it			1
after rounding a bend , mr @entity6 's bike veers onto the wrong side of the road into the path of an oncoming car faced with a choice of hitting the car head - on or crashing over the edge , he steers off the road and towards the steep hill below @entity67 and trees then swirl in the footage as mr @entity6 tumbles down the 40 - foot hill the video shows the horrific moment mr @entity6 spins down the hill , smashing through bushes and undergrowth the camera finally comes to a rest in some long grass at the bottom of the hill after the fall mr @entity6 said the world went ' black and white ' as he fell down the hill and time appeared to slow down he said drivers and other bikers at the scene could n't believe it when they saw him get up after the 40 - ft fall ' my bike stayed at the top of the ridge and i continued down			1
if my bike had followed me and crushed me , i would not be standing here today			2
' mr @entity6 was was enjoying a saturday ride when he under - steered on a corner and careered into the path of an oncoming @entity96 car			1
he added : ' i was going round the corner and i was going wider and wider and wider			0
when i saw the first bit of the car i knew i was in trouble			1
' i chose to go off the cliff , rather than hit the car - it was the best thing i could do			1
i thought that was me dead			2
' i opened my eyes at the bottom of the hill and everything was black and white			2
' it was either hit them and possibly kill them or swerve off the ridge possibly killing myself			0
it is amazing how much time you actually have in those situations , or how slow time goes by			0
' motorbike enthusiast mr @entity6 said he ' thought he was a gonner ' when he went over the edge he went to hospital after the incident but only sustained mild concussion and a cut on his hand from some barbed wire the couple in the silver @entity96 pulled over at the side of the ridge to check on mr @entity6 only to be left stunned when he clambered up the cliff and said : ' i ’m ok			1
' mr @entity6 added : ' they were so gobsmacked to see me standing there , they could not believe it			1
‘ by the time they had got back to where it happened i popped back over the ridge			1
' they were obviously very worried indeed			0
i did apologise to them as that must have been a dreadful ordeal for them			0
i suppose i felt somewhat invincible because i did n’t even have a broken bone and i walked away			0
' mr @entity6 went to hospital the day after the incident last month and apart from some mild concussion and a cut on his hand from some barbed wire he unhurt and sent home the next day			1
mr @entity6 hopes others will learn from his mistake			1
he said : ' i put it on @entity45 as a kind of deterrent to others not to be as stupid as i was			0
' i always have a @entity162 camera on my head , it ’s just for fun normally - but also there if anything more serious happens like this			1
' for some reason i always go wide on that corner and i did it again and it nearly cost me my life			0
the @entity10 is one of the most dangerous roads in the country , mainly for bikers			0
' mr @entity6 has put the video online as a warning to other motorcyclists to take care he wants others to learn from his horrific experience in an area known for fatal motorcycle crashes more than 100,000 people have seen his shocking video since he posted it online he thinks that if his bike had not stayed at the roadside it could have landed on top of him and crushed him the cat and fiddle road in @entity11 has been branded @entity3 's most dangerous after a series of fatal accidents , many involving motorcyclists ' it ’s worth putting the video up on @entity45 - even with the negative comments , if it stops others making the same mistake as me			1
' it ’s amazing how many people have seen the video			2
i put it on there as a warning to others as much as anything			0
i ’m a good rider and we often think we are better than we are			0
if you are going to be stupid things like this will happen			0
' the @entity215 and @entity10 between @entity216 , @entity49 , and @entity217 , @entity11 has been repeatedly been branded @entity3 ’s most dangerous due its severe bends and steep drops			0
the @entity221 charity report compared accident rates with the amount of traffic using the road and also found many of the crashes involved motorcyclists			2
the reports began in 2002 and since then the @entity215 has been top in eight out of 12 reports			0
there were 44 serious or fatal crashes on the seven - mile stretch of road between 2007 and 2011			2
between 2002 and 2006 , there were 35			0
road safety experts have said the route ’s ' grim reputation ' is also part of the problem with bikers and motorists seeing it as a ' challenge			0
' motorcycle friendly crash barriers have also been installed on one of the worst affected parts of the route			0
but @entity217 mechanic @entity248 , who recovers many of the vehicles after accidents on the road , said : ' many of the crashes involve motorcyclists going too fast			0
' ' they often end up going down grass banking or hitting a wall - sometimes people do get away with scratches and bruises but most the time they are seriously injured			2
if they are going over 50mph it can be pretty bad for a biker			0

@entity6 was riding in the @entity266 when the accident happened
he lost control on a bend and , after missing a car , tumbled over the edge
footage shows the 21 - year - old somersaulting down the 40 - foot drop
but , *incredibly* , he survives almost unharmed and walks back up the hill
the video was shot on a helmet camera which he uses to record his rides
he admitted that , when he went over the edge , he thought he ' was a gonner '
