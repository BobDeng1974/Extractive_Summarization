by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 30 april 2013 updated : 05:37 est , 30 april 2013 all 15 to 65 - year - olds should be tested for @entity2 , according to an influential @entity4 panel			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is calling for all @entity4 within this age range to be tested - regardless of whether they are considered to be at high risk			1
they hope this change might help to lift some of the stigma associated with hiv testing			1
despite efforts to reduce cases of hiv infection in the @entity4 in the past three decades , as many as 50,000 @entity4 become infected with the virus each year			2
all @entity4 15 to 65 - year - olds should be tested for @entity2 according to an influential @entity4 panel the @entity19 and @entity20 estimates that almost 1.2 million people in the @entity4 are infected with @entity2 , yet up to 25 per cent of them do not know it			1
according to the @entity19 , stigma has been a major stumbling block that keeps many from seeking out testing , and the hope is that the change will make @entity2 testing a common part of medical care			1
the recommendations are based on evidence showing the benefits and risks of testing and treatment for @entity2 , the virus that causes @entity37			2
recent studies have shown that @entity2 treatment can reduce transmission of the virus to an uninfected partner by as much as 96 per cent			2
the new @entity5 guidelines call for screening at least once for all adults , and recommend periodic screening for individuals at higher risk of infection			1
but they do not specify how frequently people at high risk for infection should be tested			1
the guidelines also recommend that teens younger than 15 and adults older than 65 should be screened if they are at increased risk for hiv infection			0
and it recommends that all pregnant women - including those in labour - who do not know their @entity2 status should be tested			2
high - risk groups include those who have sex with gay or bisexual men , drug users and economically disadvantaged populations in which hiv rates are high			0
it is hoped this might help to lift some of the stigma associated with hiv testing			1
image shows conceptual view of @entity2 within the blood stream task force member dr @entity76 , a medical professor at @entity77 , said : ‘ we do hope the fact that the guidelines are all very similar will provide an impetus for people to offer screening because it is a very critical public - health problem			2
’ dr @entity84 said testing all adults within a certain age range may help reduce any stigma associated with testing and encourage people to get tested			1
the new guidelines from the government - backed panel of doctors and scientists now align with longstanding recommendations by the @entity4 @entity19			0
guidelines issued by the @entity5 in 2005 had recommended @entity2 screening just for high risk individuals			1
‘ @entity19 believes hiv testing should be as routine as a cholesterol test or a blood pressure check - but so far fewer than half of @entity4 have ever been tested , ’ said dr @entity99 , director of the @entity19 's @entity100 , said in a statement			1
[ caption as with the @entity19 recommendations , the @entity5 guidelines recommend that all individuals be offered the test as well as a chance to opt out of testing			1
‘ the @entity5 's new recommendations will expand the number of @entity4 who know their @entity2 status and can take action to protect themselves and their partners			2
' experts said the change will likely trigger coverage for the tests as a preventive service under the @entity123			0
under president @entity126 's healthcare law , insurers are required to cover preventive services that are recommended by the task force			0
currently , the healthcare law recommends coverage of hiv testing for adolescents and adults who are at high risk of infection			1
‘ that was based on the 2005 @entity5 recommendations , ’ said dr @entity136 , a professor of medicine at @entity138 and chief of infectious disease at @entity141 , an inner - city hospital in @entity142			0
‘ now , hopefully they will go back and recategorise that and recommend that it will be covered for every adult			0
’ dr @entity136 and others said it is too early to say whether the new guidelines will result in a significant increase in the number of tests , but the potential for insurance coverage may help			0
@entity158 , a spokeswoman for the @entity4 @entity159 , said the @entity5 ranks preventive services based on the strength of the scientific evidence documenting their benefits			0
‘ preventive services with a grade of a or b will be covered under these rules			0
this includes today 's hiv screening recommendations , ’ ms @entity158 said			0
for doctors , the new recommendations should help clear up any confusion about testing among some primary - care doctors who have not been offering the test to all their adult patients			0
‘ now , everybody agrees it should be done , ’ dr @entity136 said			0
in the @entity183 , about 96,000 people are thought to be @entity2 positive and 25 per cent of people with @entity2 are believed to be unaware that they are infected			1
these people are thought to be responsible for 75 per cent of new cases			0
it is thought that @entity2 is spreading in the @entity183 because of falling condom use and some experts believe condom use has fallen because the availability of antiretroviral drugs means that people are no longer so afraid of hiv / aids			2

@entity5 is calling for everyone to be tested
until now , it has only been recommended for high risk individuals
it is hoped the move would reduce the stigma associated with @entity2 testing
and *diagnose* the 25 *%* of infected people unaware they are infected
@entity19 says hiv testing should be as routine as blood pressure checks
