@entity0 has had an awkward start to her visit to @entity3 as she was pictured towering over @entity4 and stumbling as she tried to bow , shake his hand and curtsey at once			1
the @entity7 , dressed in a florid combination of a blazer and skirt , dwarfed the @entity4 in her silver stilettos , while he maintained his composure and smiled politely			2
she then squatted slightly while shaking his hand , seemingly trying to disguise the difference of height between them			0
mrs @entity0 , who is 5ft 9in tall , also caused embarrassment earlier in the day when she grabbed @entity17 , wife of @entity3 's prime minister @entity18 , in a hug - and - handshake combination while the @entity3 first lady was trying to bow			1
matters were not helped by the fact that she towers over him just nod and smile : the @entity4 is the height of politeness as he greets mrs @entity0 , who squats slightly as she tries to disguise the dramatic height difference between them do n't look down on me : mrs @entity0 is back to her full height , but the incline of her head indicates that she remains intensely aware of the fact that she is at least a head taller than @entity4 , centre , and his wife , @entity43 , right excessive physical contact is frowned upon in @entity3 , and strict traditions govern the practice of bowing			1
despite intensive etiquette coaching , successive @entity49 officials have famously got it wrong			0
in 2009 , president @entity52 was was photographed bending to nearly a 90 degree angle when he greeted the @entity3 emperor at the @entity55			2
his efforts were widely mocked			0
in another example of over-enthusiastic bowing , the president was pictured bowing to a robot in 2014 while the @entity3 people around him remained upright			2
in 1994 , then - president @entity62 went to the other extreme , causing offence by inclining his head and shoulders forward and mysteriously pressing his hands together when he met the @entity4			1
awkwardness and tension underpins much of the @entity7 's visit			0
her three - day trip is being described as a ' makeup call ' after she ' snubbed ' the @entity3 by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to @entity3 last year			1
@entity3 's prime minister , @entity18 , is due to make a reciprocal visit to @entity49 next month			1
mrs @entity0 's previous no - show upset members of the @entity3 establishment so deeply that one politician , @entity77 , made the outrageous claim that the @entity79 were getting divorced , as the president had been using @entity82 agents to cover for his extramarital affairs			1
worried : @entity3 's first lady listened attentively to mrs @entity0 's speech , but it is likely that in the back of her mind , she was concerned about the prospect of further hug - and - handshakes body - check : @entity0 attempts an ill - fated hug - and - handshake combination when meeting @entity3 's first lady , @entity17			1
excessive physical contact is frowned upon in @entity3 @entity95 2015 buy a similar style at @entity97 visit site @entity0 is n't shy when it comes to colors			1
yesterday she stole the show in an exquisite lime fit and flare @entity104 dress , and today she had another faultless style hit in this tantalizing burnt orange ensemble by @entity107			0
we instantly recognized this print from the @entity111 spring 2015 collection , the catwalk was awash with the acacia grenadine floral design			0
being married to the president obviously has its benefits , and getting your outfits custom made by designers is one of them			0
the @entity122 - based fashion house @entity121 created @entity0 's look especially for her but the good news is that you can get a very similar pencil skirt version by clicking right to @entity97			2
