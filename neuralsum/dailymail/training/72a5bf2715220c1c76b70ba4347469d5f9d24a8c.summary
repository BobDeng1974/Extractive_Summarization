it has been released to mark one of the most important moments in @entity4 history			0
but a commemorative coin depicting @entity6 issuing @entity7 800 years ago has been criticised for a glaring historical inaccuracy			1
experts say that depicting the king holding the parchment charter in one hand and a quill in the other is a ‘ schoolboy error ’			2
' @entity17 error ' : the @entity19 's £ 2 coin shows @entity6 holding a quill and the @entity7 on the ' tails ' side , but a historian says it should show him using a royal seal historian dr @entity26 used @entity28 figures show how the @entity7 would have been signed with a royal seal - not a quill historian dr @entity26 said @entity7 was not signed by @entity6 , who instead would have used a wax seal to endorse and authenticate documents			1
the official display mount for the £ 2 coin issued by the @entity19 also shows the monarch signing the document with a quill			1
but dr @entity26 said : ‘ to depict @entity6 holding a quill is simply a schoolboy error			1
‘ medieval kings did not authenticate documents by signing them , they did it by sealing them – or rather by getting one of their officials to do it for them			0
all the pen in @entity6 ’s hand symbolises is ignorance of this basic fact			0
’ expert opinion : dr @entity26 said all the coin symbolises is ' ignorance ' of facts dr @entity26 , 41 , the author of books including @entity6 : treachery , tyranny and the road to @entity7 , posted a picture on @entity60 showing the scene recreated with toy @entity28 figures			1
the presenter of @entity65 ’s 2003 show @entity66 joked : ‘ a far more accurate depiction of what went on at @entity69 than that produced by the @entity19			0
’ @entity6 agreed @entity7 at @entity69 , near @entity71 , in june 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in @entity75 history			2
meaning ‘ @entity7 ’ , it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody , including the king , was subject to the law , and had the right to fair trial			0
once sealed by the king , scribes made many copies in medieval latin , although only four are known to have survived			0
the @entity19 defended the coin , saying it was intended to be ‘ symbolic ’ and not a ‘ literal account of what actually occurred ’			1
a spokesman added : ‘ the design is in fact inspired by @entity6 ’s royal seal			1
’ last night the coin remained on sale for £ 10 on the @entity19 website , with a footnote saying : ‘ the image used on this coin packaging is a well - known visual representation of historical events from the time , and not factual depiction			2
the @entity19 understand that the @entity7 was in fact witnessed and sealed by @entity6 and not physically signed			2
’ the coin was designed by @entity108 , who also created the official coins to celebrate @entity111 ’s christening and a silver £ 20 coin to mark 100 years since the outbreak of the @entity115			0
the 800th anniversary coin , designed by artist @entity108 , is on sale for £ 10 with a medieval - inspired display mount			0

historian says @entity19 made ' schoolboy error ' on £ 2 @entity7 coin
@entity124 shows @entity6 signing the document with a quill 800 years ago
but dr @entity26 says the monarch would have used a royal seal
expert used @entity28 figures to show what the coin should look like
