the @entity23 alone required £ 886,996 of taxpayers ’ money to keep going			2

’ @entity47 , of the @entity46 , added : ‘ @entity48 promised that the cost of politics would come down , but it is still far too high			0

a @entity1 spokesman said the upper chamber had cut its catering subsidy by 27 per cent since 2007 and said it was their aim ‘ to halve the net cost of the catering and retail service by 2015/16 ’			1
he added : ' our catering services meet the needs of a working @entity1 of @entity29 and due to the unpredictable nature of sittings of the @entity1 , and periods where the @entity1 does n’t sit and so revenue is not generated , a subsidy is unavoidable			1
' we also pay all staff at least the @entity109 and provide workplace pensions to our refreshment department staff			0
we are proud to do so but it means our costs are higher than some commercial restaurants			0
’ but it is not only the lords which benefit from taxpayer subsidised dinners			0
