@entity13 researchers have simulated 1.2 million eruptions to work out the change in pressure required to cause a super-volcano to blow its top , @entity11 reported			1
@entity4 in the depths of a super-volcano will eventually burst out like a beach ball held under water , scientists have said			2
such a scenario would cause a massive eruption that could happen sooner rather than later and more frequently than previously thought , they warned			1
a standard volcanic eruption is pictured super-volcanoes can eject more than 1,000 cubic kilometres of material at once , covering a continent in ash , but the last time this happened was around 75,000 years ago			2
these rare events represent the biggest natural catastrophes on @entity35 except for the impact of giant meteorites			0
normal volcanic eruptions are powered by magma entering the volcanic chamber , which increases pressure building up inside and leads to an explosion			1
however , super-volcanoes ’ much larger chambers have flexible walls so that they can expand without exploding as magma enters			0
super-volcanoes ' large chambers have flexible walls so that they can expand without exploding as magma enters			0
a super volcano of the magnitude of the eruption that happened 600,000 years ago that shaped @entity52 ( pictured ) could lead to a 10 ° c drop in temperature across the globe for 10 years to find out the pressure change and flow of new lava needed to trigger a super-volcano eruption , a team led by @entity61 of the @entity62 in @entity13 simulated 1.2 million eruptions			1
their model showed that the chamber is gradually filled with magma , which is less dense than the cooler crust around it , but it eventually bursts though the top in a dramatic eruption			0
professor @entity61 believes that scientists could estimate the risk of a blast by monitoring the magma in super-volcanoes			0
the research predicts that a super eruption will occur between 10 and 100 times more often than previously estimated			1
another study , by the @entity81 , @entity80 recreated these conditions in a lab to see what it takes to trigger a super-volcano explosion			1
they squeezed silicates to pressures of 36,000 atmospheres and heating them to temperatures of almost 1,700 ° c to do this			0
a super-volcano eruption could have a major impact on the global climate			0
the @entity98 eruption in 1992 ( pictured ) , which was 100 times weaker than the a super-volcano eruption , decreased the global temperature by 0.4 ° c for a few months super-volcanoes represent the biggest natural catastrophes on @entity35 except for the impact of giant meteorites			0
scientists from the @entity81 , @entity80 , have discovered that the spontaneous eruption of a super-volcano could be driven solely by magma pressure without the need for an external trigger			1
super-volcanoes have a much larger magma chamber and are always located in areas where the heat flow from the interior of the @entity35 to the surface is very high			0
consequently the magma chamber ’s shape changes as it fills with hot magma , allowing the pressure to dissipate so that the super-volcanoes do n’t erupt very often			1
but an extra pressure caused by different densities of solid rock and liquid magma could cause an eruption			2
the researchers ’ measurements showed the pressure resulting from the different densities of rock and magma could crack more than 10km of the @entity35 ’s crust above the chamber			2
the silicates became less dense than solid rocks at the surface so that large volumes of them could breach the crust , just as professor @entity61 ’s team suggested			0
@entity142 , who led the @entity80 research said : ‘ they come more or less to the same conclusion – that buoyancy is the only real trigger that can work in very large magma chambers			1
’ he said that super-volcano eruptions may occur spontaneously , driven only by magma pressure without the need for an external trigger , according to the study published in @entity154			1
a super-volcano eruption could have a major impact on the global climate			0
the @entity98 eruption in 1992 , which was 100 times weaker than the well - known super-volcano eruption that occurred 600,000 years ago in what is now @entity52 , decreased the global temperature by 0.4 ° c for a few months			0
the predictions for a super volcano are a fall in temperatures by 10 ° c across the world for 10 years			1
however , eruptions only take place every 100,000 years or so and dr @entity142 said : it 's not something that we should worry about in our personal lives .			2
