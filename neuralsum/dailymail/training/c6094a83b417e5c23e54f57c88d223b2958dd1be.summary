by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 11:56 est , 16 october 2013 researchers have discovered a new species of fish that breathes air and has evolved to grow extra strong scaly skin that can withstand piranha bites			1
the fish is a new species of arapaima , a giant freshwater fish native to the @entity10 in @entity11 and has been named @entity12			1
in the mid- 19th century , four species of arapaima were officially recognised but in 1868 , @entity15 , a scientist at the @entity16 , published an article that suggested that all sub-species should be classified as the same species : arapaima gigas			2
the scientist 's views eventually became the commonly accepted classification			0
this image shows the latest species of arapaima , called leptosome , that has only just been officially classified the @entity28 is a species of fish found in the @entity38 in @entity11			1
they are the largest freshwater fish in @entity41 and can grow to around 6ft 7in , although many peak at around 6ft long			0
the fish has large black and green scales with red markings			1
it is known locally as ' paiche ' , which means ' red fish '			0
the new fish , dubbed @entity49 , has several distinguishing features , including an elongated sensory cavity on the head , a sheath that covers part of the dorsal fin and distinctive markings on its skin			2
although it was first discovered back in 2001 , it has taken this long for the fish to be officially classified			1
the discovery and subsequent classification means there are now five known species of arapaima			0
the most recent species was found where the @entity11 solimoes and @entity67 rivers join			2
however the latest findings called this view into question			0

' everybody for 160 years had been saying there ’s only one kind of arapaima			0
but we know now there are various species , including some not previously recognised , ' said dr. @entity93 of the @entity94 , who made the discovery			2
in separate research , experts have also studied the scales of the fish and discovered they consist of stacked spiral staircase - like layers made of collagen , protected by a hard outer shell			1
these spiral layers intertwine and curve inward and outward meaning they can repel the force of the piranha 's tiny sharp teeth - and researchers believe the scales have evolved in this way			1
the team from @entity113 wanted to know how the fish evolved to live in relative peace with the flesh - eating predators			1
they studied the scales to the highest resolution microscopic level ever used in experiments of this kind and discovered each individual scale is made up of a series of layers			1
a single scale has a hard outer shell , around 0.5mm thick , on top of a soft inner core that is double the thickness of its protective layer			0
the scales of the arapaima , pictured at microscopic levels , overlap each other by about 60 per cent			2
each scale has a 0.5mm hard outer shell on top of a soft 1mm inner core			0
the core is made up of elastic collagen and researchers believe the fish evolved this way to protect itself the core is made up of elastic collagen shaped by multiple staircase - like structures that curve in and around each other			1
the outer shell can protect the fish from initial contact from the bite , but if the teeth shatter the brittle casing , the softer core has evolved to repel the force of the bite			1
to test the scales , researchers simulated piranha bites along the row to see how the teeth penetrated them			0
they found the scales overlap each other by about 60 per cent and this adds an extra layer of protection because a piranha tooth is able to break one scale , but rarely two			0
study co-author @entity169 from the laboratory told live science : ' the beauty of the structure is when you apply a load in a certain direction , the spiral stairs have the ability to rotate , and can modify the loads you have applied to the entire sample to withstand the loads			0
' ' we want to understand how nature develops these materials , and then try to copy them and make something similar and , if possible , get the mechanical properties maybe even better and more efficient			0
' the findings are published in journal @entity188			0
@entity190 , such as the one pictured , are omnivorous meaning they eat plants and meat			0
they are indigenous to the @entity38 and live alongside the arapaima fish			1
researchers believe the fish 's scales have evolved to repel the force of the piranha 's tiny sharp teeth			1

the large @entity28 lives in the @entity38 alongside piranhas
there are now five known species of the fish including the new leptosome
although discovered in 2001 its taken 12 years to become classified
separate study has discovered the fish also has specially - designed scales
researchers studied the scales to a microscopic level for the first time
they found the fish has evolved the ' *armour* - like ' covering to protect itself
