they brought us roads and a clever sewer system			0
but it seems the @entity5 also knew a thing or two about making concrete			2
while @entity12 ’s 1960s concrete towerblocks and flyovers are crumbling , roman monuments such as the @entity9 and the @entity10 are still standing			0
now scientists have discovered the secret ingredient behind the longevity of @entity5 concrete – volcanic ash			1
scientists have discovered a secret ingredient used in @entity5 concrete which explains why some of their greatest monuments , such as the @entity10 ( pictured ) , are still standing the study by the @entity24 , in @entity25 , found @entity5 concrete showed no corrosion , with a smooth surface suggesting long - term stability			1
manufacturing modern cement requires heating a mix of limestone and clay at @entity33			0
but @entity5 architectural mortar uses 85 per cent volcanic ash , fresh water and lime , which is cast at a much lower temperature , significantly reducing its carbon footprint			1
now the researchers want to take the @entity5 techniques and apply them to modern cements			2
dr @entity43 said : ‘ if we can find ways to incorporate a substantial component of volcanic rock in the production of specialty concretes , we could greatly reduce the carbon emissions associated with their production			0
we could also improve their durability and mechanical resistance over time			0
’ the study , published in the @entity55 , involved using beams of x-rays on a reproduction of @entity5 volcanic ash - lime mortar			1
while @entity12 ’s 1960s concrete towerblocks and flyovers are crumbling , the @entity9 in @entity60 is still standing in the concrete walls of @entity65 in @entity60 , constructed around 110 ad , this mortar binds cobble - sized fragments of tuff – consolidated volcanic ash – and brick			1
the team observed the mineral changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900 - year - old samples of the original			2
they discovered that the concrete contained particular water - based elements that prevented it from cracking .			0

volcanic ash made up more than 85 per cent of @entity60 *'s* architectural mortar
scientists believe this ingredient has helped age - old monuments *survive*
researchers want to take @entity5 *methods* and apply them to our cements
