the mystery over @entity2 ’s whereabouts for the past five weeks has deepened as a surprise new claim emerged suggesting he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in @entity6			1
following the leader 's public re-emergence yesterday , the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , told the @entity11 that there was ‘ no doubt about it ’ that @entity2 was healthy			1
but his comments came as a source told the @entity17 that the 31 - year - old had spent the past few weeks in a @entity20 hospital having his stomach tied , or ‘ banded ’ , to help him fight his weight gain			2
last month it was claimed @entity2 has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of @entity28 cheese , which he got a taste for while a student in @entity31			1
a unhealthy appetite for @entity28 is believed to be a key factor in @entity2 's weight ballooning in recent months issues : @entity2 is reported to be suffering from gout , from diabetes , from a brain haemorrhage , from a heart ailment , from a leg injury that required surgery from a doctor , from mental illness or from a cheese addiction the reputable source , who has connections with intelligence agencies in the @entity63 , said @entity2 ’s stay in hospital in @entity6 was the reason for his no - show at the recent 69th anniversary celebrations of the ruling @entity69			1
he has also been treated in recent weeks for sprains or fractures , to his ankles - a problem that developed after he injured a leg while joining troops in a military exercise in august			0
it has since been speculated that , as he continued to limp around , his weight added to the pressure on both legs , resulting in him seeking medical treatment for both that injury and his weight gain			0
a unhealthy appetite for @entity28 , also known as @entity31 cheese , is believed to be a key factor in @entity2 's weight ballooning in recent months			1
experts believe @entity2 may have been deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his late grandfather @entity91 , who is venerated in @entity92 as the nation 's founder and still holds the title @entity96 , despite having died 20 years ago			2
his absence fuelled speculation about his health and even rumours of a coup in the nuclear - armed state smiling : this photograph from @entity7 newspaper @entity105 shows @entity7 leader @entity2 during an inspection tour of a newly - built housing complex in @entity108 another photograph from @entity105 of @entity2 during an inspection tour of a newly - built housing complex enemy : a @entity114 man watches a tv news program showing @entity2 using his cane yesterday not un-well : tv monitors in @entity114 show a news report about the health of the @entity7 leader			1
the captions mockingly refer to the ' @entity122 ' the ambassador ’s comment that @entity2 was healthy would still hold true even if the leader was in hospital , as stomach banding would be classified as cosmetic , rather than treatment for an illness			2
the @entity7 regime has made no mention of @entity2 being in @entity20 and the claim by the source - a former government official of a @entity136 country who retains close ties with @entity139 intelligence agencies - could not be independently verified			2
but @entity108 officials have admitted that @entity2 has been suffering ‘ discomfort ’ - while emphasising that he is still very much in control of the country			0
@entity2 's unhealthy obsession with @entity28 has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of @entity92 struggling to find enough to eat			1

but despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens , @entity2 continues to gorge on @entity31 cheese in such vast quantities that his waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate			0
