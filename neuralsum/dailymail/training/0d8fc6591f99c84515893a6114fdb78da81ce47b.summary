but it appears that parents were even playing the originality game with their offspring right back in the 19th century - albeit with slightly less stylish results			1
according to a hilarious list of historic baby names , children born in the 1800s were given names such as @entity27 and @entity28 by their highly - amused parents			1

@entity65 , 39 , a partner at the firm , said the hilarious names could be interpreted as being ' unkind ' because somebody has to live with it			1
but he also said it showed @entity64 had a real sense of humour at that time			1
he said : ' our genealogists get to look through hundreds of thousands of birth , death and marriage records			1
' over the years we have picked out certain names which have amused us and we 've made a note of them			1
' we have been pulling them out of records for the past 40 years and some of them are quite brilliant and hilarious			0
