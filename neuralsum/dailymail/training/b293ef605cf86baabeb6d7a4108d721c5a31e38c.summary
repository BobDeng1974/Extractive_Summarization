to her mother , @entity0 was a funny and sweet charter graduate who loved music and ' was liked by everyone '			1
but to the gangs of @entity6 's notorious @entity5 , she was a ' young killa ' who went by the names ' @entity9 ' and ' @entity11 ' , rumored to have committed her first murder at the age of 14			1
some claim she was involved in up to 20 gangland deaths			1
but on friday april 11 , at 17 - years - old , @entity0 was gunned down as she walked to have lunch at a friend 's house in @entity19 about 3.30pm , shot a reported nine times in the chest , neck and jaw			1
' mythical ' : @entity0 , a prominent name among @entity6 's @entity5 gangs , was purported to have killed two people , one when she was just 14 - years - old			1
following her shooting death earlier this month , she has been immortalized on social media and @entity30 @entity0 ( left ) - seen here in a rap video called ' @entity33 ' produced by members of the the @entity35 that she ran with - was executed on april 11 in @entity6 in memoriam : this montage of photos of @entity0 ' @entity39 has been circulated on @entity40 following her shooting death in @entity6 's @entity5 scene : the 17 - year - old was shot up to nine times by a hooded gunman as she walked to a friends house around 3.30pm on april 11 on the 6400 block of @entity48 likeness : @entity0 was nicknamed ' @entity39 ' after the @entity51 character @entity39 ( pictured ) , played by @entity52 , a cold - blooded @entity53 assassin mourning : @entity0 ' mother @entity54 said her ' sweet and loving ' daughter is not the person she has been shown to be some 45 other people were shot on the same weekend in the city that has come to be called ' @entity6 ' - a brutal nickname used to describe today 's @entity6 in terms of its danger and crime - six of which were children			1
but @entity0 has since become something of a mythical figure online , immortalized in @entity30 memorials and rap videos as ' @entity39 ' , a reference to the fictional ' @entity39 ' character from tv series @entity51 - a cold - blooded killer from the harsh streets of @entity53			1

' @entity167 killa ' : @entity0 covers her face as she appears in the ' @entity33 ' video in early 2013 , measuring up to her much - older male counterparts the ' @entity33 ' video was an attempt for members of the gang to be noticed by record labels and hopefully be signed as artists , as some of their rivals had already done the @entity178 's were sending out a clear message with the video , attempting to get the attention of music producers and record labels who had recently taken a huge financial interest in gritty street rap performed by people who were actually ' living ' their songs , and not writing about ' thug life ' from a condo in @entity191			1
@entity194 ' @entity193 ' @entity192 , a member of rival gang @entity195 - the @entity111 gang - had already been signed by @entity197 , moving from the @entity5 to a mansion in the suburbs and recording songs that derided the @entity202 clan			1
