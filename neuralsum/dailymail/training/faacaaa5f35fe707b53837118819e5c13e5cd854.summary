a stunned homeowner has filmed himself setting fire to highly flammable water gushing from his bathroom tap			1
in the clip uploaded to @entity6 , @entity4 produces a intensely bright yellow fireball to erupt from a flowing tap by putting a lighter flame to the liquid			1
mr @entity4 , who works on oil fields near his home in @entity13 , discovered the worrying phenomenon while in the shower			1
he added : ' first time i did it there was a huge fireball - took up the entire sink - so that 's why i 'm a little jumpy going it			0
i do n't want to blow up the bathroom			0
' shock : @entity4 , pictured , discovered his tap water is flammable his video has been viewed more than 237,000 times since being uploaded to @entity6 just over a week ago			1
it has been speculated that the explosive tap water is the result of oil drilling nearby - specifically if it has anything to with hydraulic fracturing , which is popularly known as ' fracking '			1
this is the process by which natural gas is extracted by using water , sand and toxic chemicals injected at high pressure into oil of methane gas deposits to fracture the rock above and release the liquid or gas below			0
fracking involves releasing natural gas trapped in shale formations by blasting a mix of water , sand and chemicals into the rock			0
it has unlocked reserves that could supply the @entity62 for 100 years , although environmentalists say that fracking can contaminate water supplies			1
@entity13 , which is home to just 700,000 people , is the centre of a fracking boom			1
it is now the second largest oil - producing state in @entity62 , producing more than 911,000 barrels a day - largely due to the use of fracking technology			1
flammable : the fireball bursts up the running water and over @entity4 's hand within split seconds explosive : a stunned @entity4 realises he has been bathing in and brushing his teeth with this water campaigners against fracking have previously documented flammable water			1
invented in 1949 , hydraulic fracking involves drilling more than 7,000ft down into gas - bearing shale before pumping a mixture of water and sand at high pressure into the shale , causing tiny fractures which allow long - term release of gas			2
in the @entity62 large - scale fracking since 2005 has caused energy prices to plummet , sparked economic recovery and cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels last seen in 1990			1
however , survey by the @entity100 showed the public ’s growing anxiety over fracking			0
almost half ( 49 per cent ) of those polled in a recent survey opposed the increased use of fracking — up from 38 per cent people in a similar survey in march — while 44 per cent were in favour			2
the skepticism comes as the industry is making concerted efforts to change the ingredients used in fracking fluids and focusing on recycling the water it consumes			0
in 2012 , activist @entity118 , from @entity119 , @entity120 , produced a video of her lighing water flowing from her kitchen tap			0
@entity118 and the ' @entity124 ' claimed the water has become flammable because of increased methane levels in the surrounding rock which had been disturbed by the controversial fracking activity			0
while @entity120 regulators did fine the @entity131 $ 900,000 for contaminating the water supplies of 16 homes in @entity134 with methane , there has been no conclusive evidence that fracking was to blame			0
but one commenter on mr @entity4 's video insisted there could be other reasons for the flames			2
@entity6 user shorefisherman said : ' it 's completely natural , and is very common here in rural @entity13 where many people have a private well for their water source			2
' many aquifers out here are what we call " gassy wells " there 's areas underground where natural gasses like methane are trapped in the ground with the water and bubble up the plumbing when you turn a faucet on			0
' been that way long before fracking ever started in this state ﻿			2

@entity4 , of @entity13 , saw flames erupting from bathroom tap
phenomenon is caused by *hydrolic* fracturing or ' fracking ' , some warn
@entity13 , home to just 700,000 people , is the center of a fracking boom
@entity179 is now the second largest oil - producing state in @entity62
