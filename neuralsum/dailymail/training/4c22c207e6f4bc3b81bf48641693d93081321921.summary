a model railway version of @entity5 , complete with guard towers and barbed wire , at a tourist attraction popular with children has sparked fury labourers ' huts and cattle trucks are on display as part of the exhibit at @entity14 's @entity13 and planes the static train set is a dark addition to the intricate village green , mountain and woodland rail layouts at the venue the detailed model of @entity5 , where at least 1.3million people were slaughtered during the @entity44 , shows a train entering the @entity47 death camp			1
the model of the camp where around a million @entity50 were murdered is situated next to a 1930s seaside scene and @entity52 in the tourist attraction			1
the exhibit claims it ' will take you on a journey of adventure past , present and future '			0
@entity59 , a @entity11 expert from @entity60 , said : ' it 's a step too far and i really do n't understand the thought process			1
did someone wake - up one morning and say , " you know what this place needs ... " ' i think the holocaust is a vital part of kids ' education			0
but i also think that during a light - hearted , family day out to suddenly be confronted by a model of a concentration camp is bizarre			2
' if it was a prisoner of war camp , maybe it would be ok , but this is a concentration camp			0
thankfully , it 's a static display			1
imagine if the train was moving			2
i do think it 's very unusual , i do think it 's out of place			2
' the detailed model of @entity5 , where at least 1.3million people were slaughtered during the @entity44 , shows a train entering the @entity47 death camp a @entity11 expert said it was a ' step too far ' , while a concentration camp survivor also criticised the model @entity92 , a survivor of both @entity94 and @entity95 concentration camps who now gives talks on the traumatic experiences , also criticised the model railway			1
the 84 - year - old said : ' what are they trying to say ? they used trains in wartime and trains played a very big part in the @entity11 , they could not have done what they did without trains			1
' they were moving millions of people , but then you have to show the whole exhibition in a different context			0
as it is , it is useless , frivolous , even			0
' visitor to the attraction @entity120 said : ' it 's just unthinking and crass			0
totally bizarre , those are the only words for it			0
' it is just not something you put in a train exhibition , it is just not something you put in a fun activity centre where you can play with @entity131			0
it 's not the kind of thing you buy from a toy shop or even a hobby shop			0
' the attraction 's managing director defended the piece , saying it had proven popular with visitors death camp : at least a million @entity50 were killed at @entity5 during the @entity44 @entity143 , managing director of @entity14 's @entity144 , defended the piece and said it had proven popular with visitors			1
he said : ' it 's gone down very well			0
i have seen people in tears as they realise that without the trains the @entity11 would not have happened			1
' for some schools , it 's part of their curriculum so we can show it to them			0
' he pointed out that the attraction has a @entity164 high - speed rail link scene , adding that ' some may find that more controversial '			0
' our depiction of a concentration camp is meant as a small reflection on those who suffered during the @entity44			0
it does not represent @entity5 or anywhere in particular			2
however , the 70th anniversary of the liberation of @entity5 was celebrated in january and so our little model is a timely reminder of that , ' he said			1
of all of the @entity47 's extermination camps , @entity5 is the most infamous because of the especially large number of people murdered there			1
@entity5 , in southern @entity182 , was the final destination for one in six of @entity183 's @entity50 as well as prisoners of war , gypsies and other groups deemed undesirable by the @entity187			1
the original camp , @entity5 , was built in 1940 to house @entity182 and @entity190 prisoners , and continued to do so throughout the @entity47 period , although @entity50 were also held in the camp from the start			2
@entity194 was built in 1941 and was designated an extermination camp by @entity197 leader @entity196 the same year			0
one of the first death camps , gas chambers were pioneered at @entity5 and replaced the unreliable gas van method , which saw small groups murdered using the carbon monoxide produced by the exhaust			2
the technology paved the way for a further five large camps : @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 , as well as two smaller camps , @entity213 in what is now @entity215 and @entity216 in @entity217			0
but of all the camps , none murdered as many as @entity5 which , after mass transports of prisoners began in 1942 , was able to ‘ process ’ 9,000 @entity50 a day at the peak of its operations			2
among those who died at @entity227 were 400,000 @entity228 , 300,000 @entity182 , 69,000 @entity229 , 25,000 @entity230 , 7,500 @entity231 and six @entity233 jews from the @entity234			0
