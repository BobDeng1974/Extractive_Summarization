lost for words : mr @entity1 , pictured , said the couple wasted money on a number of experts a high court judge has told a couple that their £ 920,000 divorce was a waste of time and money after they spent nearly a third of their multi-million pound fortune on legal fees			1
the businessman and his wife , known only as @entity20 and @entity21 , ran up the extortionate bills paying for lawyers and experts to advise them on the division of nearly £ 3million in joint assets			1
it meant the 54 - year - old man was left with a share of the estate that was worth £ 841,500 - nearly £ 200,000 less than the amount spent on their lawyers			1
his wife , 44 , received roughly £ 1,120,000			0
the ' eye - watering ' sum prompted mr @entity36 , who analysed the case , to call for reforms that will set a ' costs cap ' on what lawyers can charge their clients			1
the judge said the time had come for law - makers to ' do something ' about excess litigation costs run up by couples arguing over who should get what			1
he called for change in a written ruling after analysing the businessman 's case at a hearing in the @entity55 of the @entity55 in @entity56			2
he said : ' i must confess to have been almost lost for words when the scale of this madness was revealed to me			0
' the couple , who have two teenage children , started living together in the mid- 1990s and separated in 2011 after being together for 18 years			0
the costs of the case started to rise when the couple spent £ 150,000 employing forensic accountants to value the man 's market gardening business			1
the couple commissioned so many reports that they presented the court with a total of 12 files			0
mr @entity36 said the spending transformed a case that was ' surely so easily settleable ' into one that was ' almost impossible to compromise '			1
he said he had presided over a seven - day trial where the ' principal focus ' had been a ' bitter war of recrimination and denunciation about who was more at fault for this appalling state of affairs '			0
and he concluded that the woman should get assets worth just over £ 1 million and the man , who had spent £ 182,000 more on costs that his estranged wife , just under £ 900,000 worth of assets			2
he added : ' such a result should not be allowed to happen again , ' before calling for two measures to be introduced - a costs cap and a fixed pricing for cases			1
reform : the judge said the time had come for law - makers to ' do something ' about excess legal costs			2
above , @entity105 , which houses the @entity55 of the @entity55 in @entity56 he said : ' law - makers must stop saying something must be done and actually do something			0
' he said that the court should be able to impose a ' costs cap ' at the ' very beginning of the case ' on ' what may be charged by the lawyers to their client			1
he said a cap could be varied if there was a ' big change ' in circumstances			0
he added that under current rules the power of the court to controlled such fees is ' very limited '			0
mr @entity36 also supported legislation that would allow a client to demand a fixed price for a case			1
this would mark a change in the payment structure as clients are currently charged per hour			0
he said he hoped that it might help bring down the number of people who appeared in court representing themselves			0
he said : ' if a litigant on the cusp of self - representation knew at the start of the case how much it was going to cost for each phase then he may well opt for representation			2
' he concluded : '' in my opinion only if these two steps are taken will the grotesque leaching of costs , such as has occurred in this case , be arrested			2

couple paid for lawyers and experts to advise on division of £ *3.2million*
' eye - watering costs ' meant *husband* *walked* away with less than lawyers
mr @entity36 said case was *n't* unusual and called for ' costs cap '
also called for lawyers to charge fixed price rather than rate per hour
