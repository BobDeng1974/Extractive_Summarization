by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 17:17 est , 16 february 2013 @entity1 has launched a new running shoe with new technology they say will revolutionise running			1
the sportswear giant say the £ 110 boost , which has added bounce built into its soles , is their most advanced to date			1
the footwear contains a new material - dubbed ' energy capsules ' that are melted and built into the sole			1
the bouncy material returns more energy to the runner - meaning the wearer can run more efficiently on the roads and go for longer without expending as much energy			2
' ' @entity30 , is designed to show off the high energy return and the extremely soft cushioning			2
when you try this trainer on , you 'll know your way of running has changed for good , ' they say			0
the lightweight shoe will be launched on 27 february with just one design - a minimalist black and yellow - though other variations will follow , including a professional athletes ' version to be worn for the @entity43 by @entity45 runner @entity44 , winner of the 2012 event			1
the energy boost is the first running shoe from adidas to be equipped with the revolutionary technology , but the brand says it will not be the last			1
' this is only the start of the running revolution , ' they said			0
@entity55 , senior innovation director for adidas , told @entity57 yesterday at a demonstration for the product that he worked with chemicals giant @entity60 to develop the product over three years			0
hi - tech : the boost shoe was three years in development and uses new ' energy capsule ' technology to give the midsole of the shoe unprecedented bounce showing that a metal ball would bounce of the sole of a boost trained more than 60cm ( 2ft ) higher than material used in other trainers , he told how the innovation was developed			1
' we knew that if we could find a way to use the material 's potential in midsoles , we would have a game changer on our hands , ' he said			0
market analysts told @entity57 yesterday that this new products is a much - needed addition to the adidas line , given the fact that @entity87 holds a 54 per cent share of the running shoe market in the @entity90 compared to the 4.4 per cent market share held by adidas			2
the boost is said to be a response to @entity87 's @entity96 range			0
