transplanting new brain cells into patients diagnosed with @entity3 could help reverse their memory loss , experts claim			1
a new study by @entity7 scientists revealed a way to alleviate the learning and memory deficits caused by a gene linked to the disease			1
their research saw improved brain activity , restoring cognition to normal levels in elderly mice			0
the transplants helped to replenish the brain , replacing the cells lost to the @entity24 gene , regulating brain activity and improving learning and memory abilities			1
scientists in the @entity7 believe transplanting new brain cells into patients suffering @entity3 could have reverse memory loss the research was done by scientists at the @entity32 and the @entity33			1
first author @entity34 , said : ' this is the first time transplantation of inhibitory neuron progenitors has been used in aged @entity3 's disease models			0
' working with older animals can be challenging from a technical standpoint , and it was amazing to see that the cells not only survived but affected activity and behaviour			0
' the team behind the study said the success of the treatment in older mice , was particularly important given their age corresponds to humans in late adulthood			0
that is the age at which any treatment derived from the study , would be used therapeutically in @entity3 's patients			0
senior researcher @entity56 siad : this is a very important proof of concept study			0
the new study targeted cells that were lost due to the @entity24 gene , which is linked with the disease ' the fact that we see a functional integration of these cells into the hippocampal circuitry and a complete rescue of learning and memory deficits in an aged model of alzheimer 's disease is very exciting			1
' dr @entity56 said the potential implications for the findings are far reaching , and could pave the way for new treatments in the future			2
he said : ' stem cell therapy in humans is still a long way off			0
however , this study tells us that if there is any way we can enhance inhibitory neuron function in the hippocampus , like through the development of small molecule compounds , it may be beneficial for alzheimer disease patients			0
' the @entity24 gene , carried by around 25 per cent of the population and is involved in 60 to 75 per cent of @entity3 's cases , disrupts the balance of the brain			1
it causes the decline of cells essential to maintain normal brain activity , particularly in the hippocampus - an important memory centre in the brain			2
scientists carrying out the latest study hoped that by grafting those cells essential to normal brain activity into the hippocampus of elderly mice carrying the @entity24 gene , would replace the lost cells and restoring normal brain function			1
the new cells , transplanted into the brains , survived , enhancing the brain 's ability to learn and remember .			2

the new brain cells could help reverse memory deficit and learning *difficulty*
researchers replaced cells lost to the @entity24 gene , linked to the disease
they hope findings could help experts find new treatments in the future
