by @entity0 a chocolate labrador who flies around the @entity3 with her owner in his six - seater @entity6 light aircraft has been given a crew card after racking up more than 250 flying hours			1
three - year - old @entity8 , who flies with @entity9 , 50 , is now able to pass through the crew only channels at airports after becoming the only dog in the country to be recognised by the @entity15 and @entity16 ( @entity17 )			1
the pet , who takes to the skies every weekend and has flown more than 50,000 miles , has goggles , a special harness to strap her into the cockpit , and is rewarded with a sausage when she lands			2
she leaps into his @entity47 happily , and has touched won at airports across @entity49 , including @entity50 , @entity51 and various far - flung @entity53 islands			1
mr @entity9 said : ' i used to go flying with friends , but when we got @entity8 three years ago i thought it would be fun to take her up in the plane with me			1
' i bought some small ear protectors for her to wear and the first time we just taxied around the airport to make sure she enjoyed it			0
' it all went well so we then went on a short flight and she took it all in her stride and seemed very happy			0
' now the pair fly most weekends , visiting beaches such as @entity70 in @entity53 , @entity71 in @entity50 and @entity72 in @entity51 , where @entity8 enjoys a run on the sand and a sausage			1
the labrador , seen here without her @entity44 - style goggles , has visited airports right across @entity49 needs a pawprint : @entity8 is the only dog to have an @entity15 ' and @entity16 crew card with her goggles and flying hat , @entity8 looks rather like the cartoon character @entity44 , pictured right with @entity86 vip access : now @entity8 has her card , she can go through special channels at many airports across the @entity3 mr @entity9 said : ' she usually sits next to me in the front of the plane but if other people come with me she will stretch out on the back seat , ' ' i get a lot of comments and smiles when i land at an airport and people realise my co-pilot is a dog			1
' he added : ' @entity8 usually wears a fluorescent jacket and as soon as she puts it on , she knows she is going flying			2
she loves dressing up for the part			0
' the crew card came about after mr @entity9 visited the @entity17 at an exhibition and told them how many flying hours his labrador had			1
he was told she was eligible for a vip card , which gives the holder benefits including hotel and hire car discounts , and a card duly arrived in the post soon afterwards			0
he said : ' i have shown the card , along with mine , at some of the bigger airports and it always causes great amusement			0
even the most glum security men break into a smile			0
' mr @entity9 gave @entity8 her first taste of flying by simply taxiing around the runway - but she liked it @entity126 : mr @entity9 used to go flying with friends , but now he prefers to take @entity8 in his @entity6 @entity44 was the canine sidekick of the hapless baddie , @entity86 , in the @entity129 and other cartoons			1
@entity44 first appeared in @entity131 in 1968 , but the cartoon 's popularity was such that it continued well into the new millennium			2
@entity86 and @entity135 was a series of cartoons in which the duo tried to catch @entity139 , a carrier pigeon who carried secret messages to their opponents			0
with the two villains featuring as aviators in the @entity147 , they wore @entity149 caps and goggles and tried , but usually failed , to capture their feathered foe			0
the cartoon series ' original run was from 1969 - 1970 , but it garnered such a fanbase that it was syndicated throughout the 1970s and 1980s , before a box - set was released in 2005 .			2

private pilot @entity9 , 50 , first took his dog up at three months
now three - year - old @entity8 has more than 250 flying hours under her belt
sits beside mr @entity9 in cockpit of his six - seat @entity47
@entity8 , from @entity40 , @entity41 , has goggles and a harness
as a result , she looks rather like the 1969 flying cartoon dog , @entity44
her *destinations* have included some @entity53 islands , @entity50 , and @entity51
the @entity15 ' and @entity16 have *officially* recognised her
now @entity8 gets vip treatment and can walk through @entity177 channels
