by @entity0 published : 13:58 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 14:11 est , 6 february 2013 with stunning looks and an immersive story , it ’s no surprise @entity5 games have sold millions			1
and thankfully @entity6 is on the way , but it will be @entity9 ’s final outing			2
@entity10 will be powered by @entity12 ’s @entity11 and will be 30 times larger than the previous game , @entity14 , with the promise of post launch expansion packs			1
one last hurrah : this will be @entity9 's final outing unlike the last game , which was broken up into acts , @entity18 allows the uninterrupted exploration of a vast open world			1
there will also be dynamic weather systems and advanced water physics			2
fast travel will feature and main character , @entity9 , can also ride horses			1
gameplay has been improved , too , with reports that the clumsy @entity32 events that plagued its predecessor have been dropped			0
@entity35 , head of @entity12 , said : ‘ the captivating and non-linear story of @entity6 takes place in a rich , truly open - world environment			1
' a world which is thrilling to explore , full of daring adventures , momentous quests , memorable characters , and unique monsters			0
' imagine playing a dark fantasy game with the same great non-linear story as in the previous @entity5 titles , but now told in a world you can explore freely with no artificial boundaries			1
' the war - ravaged world is so huge that to reach farther places you will need to ride a horse or sail a boat to get there			2
a world where your choices have truly epic consequences			0
from the development side , this goal is extremely demanding			0
‘ our team had to make significant design changes and our tech had to be rebuilt			0
but we believe that this will lead to a completely new level of non-linearity and a whole new , richer gaming experience			0
‘ as a gamer , i would love to play this kind of @entity71 , and i think this is what many players are waiting for			1
this is our dream come true at @entity12 , and we hope it will be the same for you			0
’ check out the @entity78 : follow us on @entity79 : @ @entity80 and on @entity81 : @entity82 .			0
