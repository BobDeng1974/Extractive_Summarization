@entity0 left @entity1 in ruins as they handed @entity3 a lifeline in @entity5 and recorded their biggest - ever away win in the @entity7			1
@entity10 's @entity9 giants swept aside their @entity12 counterparts at the @entity13 , prompting bookmakers to make @entity0 favourites to win the competition ahead of @entity17 and @entity18			2
by half time , it was 5 - 0			1
after 90 minutes , it was 7 - 1 as @entity21 and his @entity1 team - mates were tormented by the attacking prowess of the reigning @entity25 champions			1
@entity26 welcomes @entity0 to the @entity27 in november and , if the @entity29 club are to win , they can only hope goalkeeper @entity30 has an off day after a near - perfect performance on tuesday night			1
bayern manager @entity10 , however , refuses to get carried away			0
' this is a fluke , ' the 43 - year - old said after the match			0
' it 's not normal to win 7 - 1			1
last season we had the legs but not the mindset			0
we needed to decide things a split - second quicker and now we 're doing that			0
@entity44 , up against @entity21 , was shown the inside and the @entity111 punished his former @entity59 team - mate by curling his shot beyond goalkeeper @entity114			1
two minutes later @entity43 could have drawn level			2
that is , if the @entity118 player did not have @entity30 to beat			0
the 27 - year - old forward let the ball roll across his body before his low shot was instinctively palmed away by the @entity9			0
it was @entity126 hero @entity94 who doubled @entity0 's lead after exchanging a tidy one - two with @entity129 - winning team - mate @entity56 , and placing the ball in the bottom - left corner			1
then a cross by defender @entity87 found the free head of @entity57 who , having drifted in behind @entity1 's @entity135 , made it 3 - 0 with barely a quarter of the game gone			1
five minutes later it was four			0
@entity44 unleashed a powerful strike looking to go across @entity68 , only for the @entity1 goalkeeper to palm it into his own net at the near post			1
it did n't help @entity1 that referee @entity106 from @entity107 had zero sympathy			0
the official pointed to the spot after a handball by @entity71 while sliding to intercept @entity90 's cross			0
@entity56 stepped up , slotted it to the right , and it was 5 - 0 at half time			1
@entity1 manager @entity153 thought it best to put @entity21 out of his misery , and replaced the 33 - year - old with @entity156			2
the home faithful were shell - shocked but did not whistle or boo the team that sit second top of @entity160 behind @entity161			0
after the break , @entity43 looked hell - bent on rewarding their support			2
the former @entity167 man hit the post from close range , before @entity30 denied the @entity170 forward with what can be ticked off as the save of the tournament so far			2
@entity75 's lofted ball from the left found @entity43 four yards out but his side - footed volley was smothered by the @entity0 goalkeeper			1
@entity30 spun in the process and diverted it away to safety			0
it was as breathtaking and instinctive a save the @entity7 has seen , but @entity30 's clean sheet was ruined five minutes later by the persistent @entity1 forward			1
a cross by @entity73 found @entity43 , whose header from point - blank range could not be stopped			2
in truth , it was the least the @entity187 international deserved			0
@entity43 of @entity1 is helped up by @entity10 during the @entity7 match which ended 7 - 1 in @entity0 's favour on tuesday night @entity0 goalkeeper @entity30 looked unstoppable on tuesday night but @entity43 finally got a goal he deserved for his efforts @entity0 's @entity44 ran circles around @entity21 ( pictured , left ) on tuesday night and the former @entity59 star was substituted at half time @entity95 scores the final goal of the match to complete the 7 - 1 scoreline against a shell - shocked @entity1 in the @entity7 @entity3 @entity199 ( @entity200 ) @entity0 ( @entity200 ) @entity1 ( a ) @entity1 @entity0 ( a ) @entity199 ( a ) @entity3 ( @entity200 ) @entity96 , on as a substitute for @entity57 , immediately made his presence felt			1
the 31 - year - old was put through by a threaded pass from @entity44 , and @entity96 won a race against @entity1 's @entity71 and @entity206 to dink the ball over the onrushing @entity68			1
@entity1 , waving the white flag , were n't out of the woods yet on a night to forget for manager @entity153 , who held @entity26 to a 1 - 1 draw at the @entity27 just three weeks ago			2
a shot by substitute @entity93 was spilled by the goalkeeper and @entity95 pounced , rounding @entity68 and completing @entity0 's record - breaking 7 - 1 away win in @entity216			1
@entity3 let a two - goal lead slip against @entity199 to draw 2 - 2 earlier on tuesday evening , but were given hope by a @entity0 side that romped to their third win in as many games in @entity5 @entity153 , on the other hand , believes @entity3 dropping two points in @entity224 was the best result of the night			2
' the only good news tonight came from @entity3 and @entity199 , which allowed us to stay second in the group , ' the @entity1 boss said after the match , who took responsibility for erring in his tactics			0
' tonight they were better than us			0
we were spectators , ' he continued			0
' it shows us we have a way to go to reach the level of the world 's top squads			0
