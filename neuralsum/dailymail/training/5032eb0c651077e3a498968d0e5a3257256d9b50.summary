after the celebration comes the hangover — or at least a sober analysis of @entity4 ’s standing in @entity5			1
having chosen @entity9 ’s 65th birthday to stage one of the most dramatic and unlikely comebacks in the manager ’s 18 years at the club , his team might have been tempted to raise a glass to their fortitude and spirit as they flew back from @entity17 on wednesday night			2
however , the euphoria of such an astonishing turnaround against @entity20 , with goals from @entity22 and @entity23 in the last two minutes keeping them on course for the knockout stages , could not mask the previous 88 which had exposed their @entity5 pretensions			1
@entity23 's last - gasp goal snatched the points for @entity4 at @entity20 on wednesday night per @entity30 congratulates @entity23 after @entity4 came from behind to earn victory and at least per @entity30 , captain for the evening , was not in the mood to soft - pedal his analysis of the performance			1
@entity37 on saturday may be licking their wounds from an 8 - 0 defeat at @entity40 , but @entity4 are hardly firing on all cylinders			1
‘ the last five minutes were great , ’ said the @entity44 @entity43 winner			1
‘ for 85 minutes we lacked a bit of everything			1
we are just pleased with the last five minutes and our finishing			2
everyone knows that it is a difficult start to the season for us , and confidence is not how we want it			0
mertesacker admits @entity4 were off the pace against their @entity57 opponents @entity4 players celebrate at the final whistle after sealing an unlikely win away in @entity5 ' the character is good and the mentality is good			1
but football-wise we lack a few things			0
the passing game is not as efficient as last year			0
we are not at our best			0
we have to be honest with ourselves and train harder			0
‘ we have to do better with our own possession , to put more pressure on the opposition , not to lose so many balls in the middle of the park , to play more in wide areas			0
' it is better to expose them there , instead of playing one - twos through the middle			2
it does n’t work as much as last season , so we have to work on that			0
’ @entity23 's late intervention saved manager @entity9 's blushes @entity22 started the @entity4 late show when he hauled the visitors level what can be said is that @entity4 are forging an indomitable spirit			1
they do n’t lose much now and late comebacks are becoming a trait			2
goals in the 90th minute have secured wins against @entity91 and @entity20 and draws against @entity92 and @entity93			2
but prior to the late intervention of @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity4 were being given the runaround			1
their lack of defensive cover and the frequent inability of the midfield to impose itself are well recorded			0
up front , @entity100 looked a threat but @entity103 faded			0
thankfully for @entity4 , @entity23 made the most of a rare outing			1
mertesacker said : ‘ he is in a difficult period but he showed how vital he is			2
you can wake him up any second in the day and he will score with his left foot			0
that is a quality we need			0

*gunners* came from behind to snatch 2 - 1 victory in the @entity115
late goals from @entity22 and @entity23 spared @entity4 's blushes
mertesacker admits @entity4 were second best for 85 minutes in @entity57
