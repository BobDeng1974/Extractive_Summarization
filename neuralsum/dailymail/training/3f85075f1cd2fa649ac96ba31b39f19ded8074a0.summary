the @entity0 will not be bringing in mandatory pregnancy tests for women despite a @entity4 soldier who did not know she was pregnant giving birth on the frontline in @entity7			1
there has been growing pressure for testing servicewomen before they head to the frontline after a @entity13 - born @entity4 servicewoman had a son in @entity15 on tuesday – just days after the @entity16 launched a deadly attack on the @entity4 ’s main base in @entity19			1
it has also been revealed that 200 women have had to be sent home from @entity7 and @entity23 since 2003 because they have been pregnant			1
but this is the first time a @entity4 soldier has given birth to a baby in @entity7			1
@entity15 , @entity7 : a @entity13 woman soldier stationed at the @entity4 base in @entity19 gave birth on tuesday			1
the super fit squaddie did not even realise she was pregnant unexpected task : the soldier , who has not been named , was taken to @entity15 's £ 10million field hospital where @entity35 medics delivered her baby currently soldiers have hearing , sight , blood and weight - related tests but nothing to find out if they are carrying a baby			1
' no , we will not be bringing in mandatory pregnancy tests			0
we do not test women for lots of things and believe it really is up to them to come forward if they are pregnant , ' a @entity0 spokesman told @entity51			1
' the problem is that we could test them before they go but they could only produce a positive test weeks later			2
so we do not do it			0
' there is only about ten cases a year and as soon as they find out we sent them home			0
' the baby was born five weeks premature and both mother and child were said to be doing well			1
a ' specialist paediatric retrieval team ' from the @entity65 in @entity66 will travel to @entity7 in the next few days to provide care for the soldier and her son on their @entity71 flight home			2
the birth has stunned military chiefs and led to calls for extra medical checks on women who are sent to the warzone			1
the soldier , a gunner in the @entity79 who helped provide covering fire for troops fighting insurgents , was unaware that she was carrying a child			1
this screengrab of a video released by a @entity16 media unit purports to show last weekend 's raid on @entity15 : the pregnant soldier , a gunner in the @entity79 , was part of the forces mobilised to defend the base she had been deployed with the 12th @entity92 since march , but two days ago complained of severe stomach pains			1
can you be pregnant on the front line ? the @entity0 says that nobody can be deployed on operations if they are pregnant and if they fall pregnant or are found to be pregnant on tour then they will be sent home immediately			1
if they are at sea then they will be taken to the nearest port and sent home			0
as soon as they get back their duties until maternity leave starts will ensure they are kept healthy and safe			0
are there pregnancy tests carried out before tours ? no , testing of this kind does not happen on the basis that they believe a person would not knowingly go on tour when they are pregnant			2
personnel have hearing , eyesight and blood tests , as well as @entity122 measurements , but no pregnancy test at the moment			0
although this new case may increase the pressure for one			0
what if they are on active service in the @entity4 ? a pregnant woman can remain in the job up until the 28th week of pregnancy then they must stand down			1
she will be medically assessed and must have another one before she returns to work			0
when can they return to front line duties ? no servicewoman will be sent a warzone until at least six months after they have given birth , unless they volunteer - but this still may be subject to certain conditions			1
to her astonishment , medics informed her that she was about to give birth			2
she was in the 34th week of her pregnancy , meaning she conceived before flying to @entity7 for her six - month tour of duty			2
she was taken to @entity15 ’s £ 10million field hospital where doctors – who are more used to carrying out amputations and treating bullet wounds – delivered her son			0
despite its location , the hospital is one of the best equipped in the world and has portable x-ray machines , an operating theatre , @entity158 scanner and an intensive care unit capable of treating up to 20 seriously - ill patients			2
a military source said : ‘ this has left us completely gobsmacked			0
you prepare yourself for dealing with war wounded at @entity15 – not a mother giving birth to a baby			1
it is the talk of the camp			0
‘ this is a very unusual case			0
the mother deployed not realising she was pregnant and had no idea she was pregnant until she gave birth			1
she has not done anything wrong			0
’ lieutenant colonel @entity176 , commanding officer of the field hospital , said : ‘ this is a unique occurrence , but my team is well - rehearsed in the unexpected and they adapted brilliantly to this situation			2
‘ i am pleased to report the mother and baby are doing well and we are all delighted at the outcome			2
’ the @entity13 soldier had passed her tough pre-deployment training , which included a gruelling eight - mile march and five - mile run , without an inkling that she was pregnant			1
a senior @entity35 insider said : ‘ it is bizarre that she did n’t feel some side effects of the pregnancy			1
she is obviously pretty fit and strong			0
the strains and demands on soldiers working on the frontline make it surprising she did n’t realise			2
emergency treatment : @entity15 's medics are more used to treating bullet and blast wounds than delivering infants ' but the conditions of deployment , the different diet , the heat of the @entity7 summer , the different hours of working , mean that many soldiers feel a little odd and put it down to the change of environment			1
‘ the baby ’s successful delivery is a wonderful testament to the outstanding job the medics do here			2
it shows how they can use their extraordinary skills to turn their hands from saving lives to delivering babies			0
‘ a lot of the medics are reservists and work in hospitals back in the @entity4 so the concept of someone giving birth is not completely alien to them			1
but they do not have paediatric equipment here so they had to make do as best they could			0
’ at war : prince @entity235 is currently deployed at @entity15 as a gunner co-pilot in an @entity238 squadron a woman killed by a suicide bomber in @entity241 left a final message on @entity243 weeks before she died , reading : ‘ i am back in @entity7 and wonder what lies before me this time			1
’ @entity245 , pictured right , of @entity247 , died alongside 11 fellow aviation workers when a female insurgent rammed a car laden with explosives into their minibus as they drove to the airport on tuesday			1
she had been due to leave the country this weekend to see friends and her sister @entity256			0
@entity258 body @entity257 claimed responsibility for the attack			0
it said the bombing was a response to a @entity264 film lampooning the @entity265 , which has sparked lethal riots across the globe			0
@entity270 - born @entity269 , 46 , had spent 17 years in the @entity272 capital			2
she had been in @entity7 to organise flights for charities and non-governmental organisations			0
a friend , @entity276 , said : ‘ she loved her job			0
she would go out there for three months at a time			0
when she came home on leave she always looked forward to going back			2
’ a statement from miss @entity245 ’s family described her as ‘ a warm , kind and generous person with an everyday objective of helping everyone she met ’			0
major @entity287 , who edits the @entity35 handbook , said the incident was ‘ astonishing ’			1
he said : ‘ commanders need to start thinking very , very carefully about what sort of medical examinations female soldiers have before they deploy on operations			1
' a simple urine test would indicate if someone was pregnant			0
the @entity35 now needs to tighten up its procedures			2
’ since 2003 at least 70 @entity4 servicewomen have been sent home from @entity7 after discovering they were expecting			2
and at least 102 female soldiers were evacuated from @entity23 after it was found they were pregnant			1
last year the @entity304 told how private @entity305 , then 21 , from @entity306 , @entity307 , served in @entity19 unaware that she was seven months ’ pregnant			1
she had conceived before going to @entity7 as a machine - gunner and thought her weight gain was due to high - calorie @entity35 rations			1
it was only when she collapsed in @entity312 after her tour of duty that she realised she was pregnant			0
around 500 @entity4 women are currently on duty in @entity7			1
they can serve in any unit except those whose primary role is to ‘ close with and kill ’ – engage in hand - to - hand combat with the enemy			0
eight women have died in @entity23 and @entity7 , two per cent of the total fatalities			0
they include corporal @entity323 , 26 , from @entity324 , serving with the @entity325 , who was killed in an explosion in @entity7 in 2008 , and second lieutenant @entity328 , 24 , from @entity329 , a friend of prince @entity331 and also of the @entity325 , who was killed by a roadside bomb in @entity23 in 2007 .			0

government tells @entity51 it is a matter of privacy and they expect women to come forward when they fall pregnant
the @entity79 gunner - said to be @entity13 - gave birth to baby five weeks premature in @entity19 on tuesday
@entity13 soldier had passed her pre-deployment training , including an eight - mile march and five - mile run , without realising she was pregnant
@entity4 @entity35 handbook editor says top brass will need to ' start thinking very , very carefully ' about how female soldiers are tested before deployment
