by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 06:53 est , 17 september 2013 a jockey has had a near miraculous recovery thanks to a pioneering new treatment to regrow a finger that his horse bit off as he fed the animal a treat			1
@entity8 , 33 , turned up at the @entity11 , @entity10 practice of dr @entity12 with a third of his right index finger in a zip - lock bag			1
his insurance company wanted medics to amputate the rest of the digit , but dr @entity12 instead tested out a unique new procedure to heal it without surgery			2
this image shows @entity8 's regrown finger after he was treated with a new procedure to restore it using a pig bladder the doctor made a template of the severed portion of mr @entity8 's finger then attached it to the stump that remained			1
astoundingly , the finger 's cells , bone , soft tissue and even nail regrew into the mould			2
mr @entity8 , from @entity39 , had been feeding a treat to his prized horse when he reached a little too far between the animals chomping jaws , costing him the top third of his index finger			1
' one of the guys that worked with me reached his hand in the horse ’s mouth , took the fingertip out , and i jumped in the car , grabbed the rest of my finger wondering what we should do , ' he told @entity59			2
although he stopped to put the severed digit on an ice lolly in an effort to preserve it , emergency room medics told mr @entity8 there was no way to re-attach it			2
mr @entity8 's mangled finger before the treatment : the procedure involved applying powder made from pulverised pig bladder to the unhealed stump every day then wrapping it in a protective sheet soaked in saline it was then that he heard of 52 - year - old dr @entity12 , of the @entity76 , who had a new way to restore the mangled extremity			1
the procedure , known as an implantation of a xenograph , involves applying powder made from pulverised pig bladder to the unhealed stump every day then wrapping it in a protective sheet soaked in saline			1
' it stimulates your body to attract your stem cells and then the stem cells start producing the tissue that is missing , ' dr @entity12 told @entity90			0
despite the complex science behind it , the treatment was so easy and painless that mr @entity8 was able to do it at home over the course of two months			0
' i could n't notice at the time but once everything had healed and the fingernail grew back , which is quite miraculous , and the skin healed over , then you really notice , ' the patient said			1
@entity103 : mr @entity8 , 33 , left , a jockey from @entity39 , traveled to the south @entity10 practice of @entity105 dr @entity12 , right , after emergency room medics told him there was no way to reattach the severed digit dr @entity12 , who believes he is the first medic in south @entity10 to prescribe the treatment , added : ' it ’s very interesting to see a patient heal			1
that ’s my passion , wound healing			0
it is fascinating to have the new results			0
' the results could pave the way to using the treatment for worse injuries			0
mr @entity8 added : ' i ’m really grateful			0
i think it ’s fantastic			0
i think in the future there ’s going to be other uses for it but it was n’t a life threatening injury to me it was something that was an accident			0

@entity8 's finger grew back after pig bladder powder was applied
jockey would otherwise have needed to have rest of the digit amputated
