good oral hygiene is linked with a reduced risk of gum disease , which has been shown to triple the risk of erectile dysfunction men who regularly brush their teeth - thereby reducing their risk of gum disease - are less likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than their less hygienic counterparts			1
new research has suggested those who suffer from inflamed gums are three times more likely to have trouble getting aroused			1
the @entity16 scientists who led the study compared 80 men aged 30 to 40 with erectile dysfunction with a control group of 82 men without erection problems			1
this showed that 53 per cent of the men with erectile dysfunction had inflamed gums , compared with 23 per cent in the control group			1
when the results were adjusted for other factors - such as age , body mass index ( @entity29 ) , household income and education level - the men with severe periodontal disease were 3.29 times more likely to suffer from erection problems than men with healthy gums			1
lead author doctor @entity40 , of @entity41 in @entity16 , said : ' erectile dysfunction is a major public health problem that affects the quality of life of some 150 million men , and their partners , worldwide			2
' physical factors cause nearly two - thirds of cases , mainly because of problems with the blood vessels , with psychological issues like emotional stress and depression accounting for the remainder			2
' chronic periodontitis , or is a group of infectious diseases caused predominantly by bacteria that most commonly occur with inflammation of the gums			0
' many studies have reported that chronic periodontitis may induce vascular diseases , such as coronary heart disease , which have been linked with erection problems			0
' the average age of the men in both groups was just under 36 and there were no significant differences when it came to @entity29 , household income and education			0
their sexual function was assessed using the @entity76 and their gum health using the plaque index , bleeding on probing , probing depth and clinical attachment level			0
the researchers found 53 per cent of the men with erectile dysfunction had inflamed gums , compared with 23 per cent in the control group dr @entity85 said : ' to our knowledge , erectile dysfunction and chronic periodontitis in humans are caused by similar risk factors , such as ageing , smoking , diabetes and coronary artery disease			1
' we therefore excluded men who had systemic disease and who were smokers from this study			2
' we particularly selected men aged between 30 and 40 to assess the impact of chronic periodontitis on erectile dysfunction without the results being influenced by the effects of ageing			0
' the result of our study support the theory that chronic periodontitis is present more often in patients with erectile dysfunction than those without and should be considered as a factor by clinicians treating men with erection problems			0
' the study was published in the @entity118 .			0
