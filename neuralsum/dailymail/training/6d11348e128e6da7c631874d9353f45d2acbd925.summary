by @entity0 @entity1 did not get where he is today — master of all he surveys at the splendid @entity5 stables in @entity6 — by mincing his words			1
‘ for me , @entity15 is not the strong link , he ’s the weak link , ’ says the 65 - year - old former @entity9 striker of the man whose form seems crucial if @entity13 ’s team are to prosper at the @entity14			1
‘ i ’ve got a lot of time for him but he ’s never delivered in @entity21 , has he ? this time , he ’s got to come to the party			1
it ’s time to step up , boy			1
he has reservations about all four forwards — @entity15 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 — in @entity13 ’s squad			1
‘ @entity47 and @entity48 have got legs , but whether they ’re good enough , or have the right temperament , i ’m not so sure , ’ says @entity34			2
‘ they ’re only going to pick up bits and pieces out there			2
they ’ve got to make something out of nothing , and can they adapt to that ? if anyone thinks @entity9 are going to play an all - out attacking game , well , they might as well keep the plane engines running because they ’ll be coming straight home			1
’ as for @entity49 , a potent force with @entity34 ’s beloved @entity66 , he says : ‘ he has a good football brain			1
he lacks pace , but he ’s a decent finisher			2
if we ’re winning 1 - 0 , stick him on , he might get another but i ’m sure @entity13 will start with @entity15 , more for what he ’s capable of , not for what he ’s done			1
’ strike ! @entity34 ( left ) scored 21 goals in 45 appearances for @entity9 paired up : @entity47 and @entity15 are likely to be @entity9 's first - choice front two up front that said , @entity34 thinks @entity9 will make it through the group stages			1
‘ if we play as a team , we ’ll do better than people think			2
goals : 21 ( inc 2 pens ) debut : october 11 , 1972 ( age 23 ) @entity9 1 @entity90 1 first goal : @entity92 0 @entity9 5 february 14 , 1973 last goal : @entity9 1 @entity92 2 june 4 , 1977 last match : @entity95 0 @entity9 0 september 7 , 1977 @entity34 is 18th on the list of @entity9 ’s all - time top scorers — equal with @entity98			1
he is the most capped @entity9 player never to play in a major tournament			1
' my first choice was @entity103 to be @entity9 manager , but i respect @entity13			1
he has them functioning as a team			2
whether they ’re good enough is another matter			2
‘ for years managers have been obsessed with picking the best players in each position , but it ’s not the best players who make the best team			2
that ’s why @entity115 have done so well , and ( @entity13 ) understands it too , as @entity117 did			2
‘ look at the team who won in 1966			2
he never tackled anyone in his life			2
@entity117 played @entity124 so that he could afford the luxury of @entity126			2
he sacrificed @entity127 , and played @entity128 and @entity129 because they worked hard			2
and he never asked you to do something you did n’t do at club level			2
that was @entity117 ’s great strength			0
’ @entity34 made his @entity9 debut under @entity117 , against @entity90 in october 1972			1
there were still two @entity14 winners in the side , @entity139 and @entity140 , and when @entity34 won the last of his 46 @entity9 caps five years ( and 21 goals ) later , he lined up alongside @entity98 and @entity143			1
facing the press : @entity15 speaks to the media during a press conference in @entity26 yet those were barren years for @entity9			1
at least @entity15 still has the chance to score in a @entity14			1
@entity34 never even got there			0
‘ yeah , i can still remember sitting in the dressing room after the @entity152 game ( october 1973 , when a 1 - 1 draw at @entity154 meant @entity9 missed out on the 1974 finals )			1
‘ that was n’t where we threw it away , though			0
it was in @entity152 where we got beat two - zip			0
it was one of @entity117 ’s rare mistakes			0
but @entity117 ’s teams were the best i played in for @entity9			1
the very best was probably the one that got stopped by the @entity152 keeper , @entity165			0
affection : @entity15 ran over to kiss son @entity167 after an @entity9 training session at @entity169 on wednesday ‘ later , under @entity170 , we had good players without being a team			1
under @entity117 , once you got into the side , the hardest thing was to get out of it			0
’ @entity13 not only understands the team ethic as @entity117 did , ventures @entity34 , but he inspires similar loyalty			0
‘ the players seem to like him and believe in what he ’s doing			0
they ’re probably not as good as the players @entity117 had , but he can make them hard to beat			0
‘ that back four has to be solid			0
@entity185 will sit deep , so we do n’t get exposed			0
after that , he needs a hod - carrier like @entity188			0
who will that be ? @entity190 ? going forward from the middle @entity191 is terrific but he ’s maybe a bit naive			0
i ’d start with @entity193			0
’ younger days : @entity15 gestures during @entity115 2006 , the first @entity14 tournament he played @entity34 adds that @entity66 will not easily replace @entity193 if the player is sold this summer			1
‘ you ’re always sad to lose players who can win games for you			0
i was one , @entity201 was another			0
if you do n’t replace them with a match - winner , you ’re in trouble			0
’ he buys four @entity66 season tickets every year , he says , but such are the demands of horse racing , @entity34 gets to @entity209 ’s only five or six times			1
‘ my two sons go , and the grandchildren			0
’ when he does go , does he still find himself besieged by autograph hunters ? after all , he scored a record 185 league goals for the @entity66 , and was instrumental in the famous @entity216 win of 1976			1
relaxed : @entity15 looks chilled as he poses for the camera after a press conference in the @entity219 @entity34 snorts			1
‘ i do n’t go because i want people to tell me how great i was			0
i ’ve no time for all that			0
’ all the same , he is not immune to nostalgia			0
hanging in his office is a huge black - and - white photograph of him in his @entity66 days , alongside his great mate , the late @entity140			1
‘ bless him , ’ he says , with a smile			0
@entity9 could do with a latter - day ball now , i suggest			1
‘ yeah , but they ’ve got what they ’ve got			0
’ there ’s no arguing with that , and so assuming that @entity9 will not win the @entity14 , who will ? ‘ @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity115			1
and @entity241 have a lot of good players , have n’t they ? but i keep coming back to it			0
the best players do n’t necessarily make the best team			0
