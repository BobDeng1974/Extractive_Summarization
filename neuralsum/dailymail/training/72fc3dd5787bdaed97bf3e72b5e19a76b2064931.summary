there have been some weird and wacky kits down the years but two @entity3 sides have released three contenders for the most unusual - with designs inspired by tuxedos , octopus tentacles and a pint of beer			0
@entity11 side @entity10 arguably win the contest with a jersey designed to look like a tuxedo			2
they will surely be suited and booted for the new season with the design being mainly black but opening up to resemble a white shirt , black buttons and black bow tie			1
their home kit has been inspired by their main sponsors , beer company @entity39 , and resembles a pint of lager with the main colour being amber and the top being white like the froth			1
but their away kit is plain black and is adorned by a giant octopus tentacle in order to display one of the main cuisines of the region of @entity64 in northwest @entity3			0
changing style : @entity24 's kits ( right ) have traditionally been fairly normal and @entity67 eccentric : @entity34 's kit designs have traditionally been fairly loud but this year 's have gone even further			0

@entity11 side @entity10 release kit resembling tuxedo
it is mainly black but opens out into a white shirt with a black bow tie
@entity11 team @entity29 have released a new home and away kit
their home kit is inspired by title sponsors , beer company @entity39
the away kit is all black but with a huge octopus tentacle
