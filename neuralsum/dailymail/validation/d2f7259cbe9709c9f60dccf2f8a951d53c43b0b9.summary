' with sprawling grounds , multiple smaller properties and access to your own vineyard , many can see the perks of paying £ 20million for their own @entity1 castle in @entity3			1
but any hopes of snapping up a similar deal closer to home have been dashed by the ever inflating prices of @entity207 flats			0
