scientists have hailed stem - cell research into a cure for diabetes as potentially the biggest medical breakthrough since antibiotics			1
it could result in an end to insulin injections , and to the disabling and deadly complications of the disease , such as strokes and heart attacks , blindness and kidney disease			1
the treatment , which involves making insulin - producing cells from stem cells , was described as a ' phenomenal accomplishment ' that will ' leave a dent in the history of diabetes '			1
this form affects 400,000 @entity35 , including almost 30,000 children			0
it occurs when the immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that make the insulin we need to turn the sugar in food into energy			2
@entity46 to make any insulin , type 1 diabetics need regular injections to stop blood sugar levels from fluctuating wildly			2
but the research also offers hope to the three million @entity35 with type 2 diabetes , in which the body does n't make insulin or the insulin does n't work properly			1
this version is fuelled by obesity , rather than the immune system and eats up a tenth of the @entity63 budget			0
as with many recent medical advances , this one is based on the potential of stem cells , the ' master cells ' that can turn into other cell type and are widely seen as a repair kit for the body			1
a pump administering insulin continuously through catheter can be used as a treatment for diabetes @entity29 researcher @entity77 , who has two children with diabetes , found a way of making insulin - producing cells			1
dr @entity77 promised his children he 'd find a cure			1
in some cases the stem cells came from human embryos			1
but he was also able to turn human skin cells into ones that make insulin â€“ something that would be much more ethically acceptable			2
grown in the lab and transplanted into a mouse with diabetes , the cells made insulin and cured the animal , the journal @entity98 reports			2
importantly , if this is ever to help humans in large numbers , dr @entity77 can make billions of cells			2
the lab - grown cells are just one step away from being trialled in people			2
other researchers have made insulin - producing cells but these are the first that seem to work as well as the real thing			1
dr @entity77 , who dedicated his career to finding a cure for type 1 diabetes 23 years ago when his son @entity114 was diagnosed with the condition , said : ' we are now just one pre-clinical step away from the finish line			1
people with type 1 diabetes need regular insulin injections to control their blood sugar levels			1
it has to be injected because if it were taken as a tablet , it would break down in the stomach and be unable to enter the bloodstream where it acts to reduce the amount of glucose			0
either a syringe or an injection pen can be used , with most people needing two to four injections a day			0
an alternative to injecting insulin is a portable pump			0
about the size of a pack of playing cards , the pump is attached to a long , thin piece of tubing , with a needle at the end , which is inserted under the skin			0
most people insert the needle into their stomach			0
it delivers constant amounts of insulin during the day			0
' it was gratifying to know that we could do something that we always thought was possible			0
if we had shown this was not possible , then i would have had to give up on this whole approach			0
now i 'm really energised			0
' dr @entity77 said he hoped to have human trials under way within a ' few years '			1
@entity160 , professor of regenerative medicine at @entity161 , said it was ' potentially a major medical breakthrough '			1
he added : ' if this scalable technology is proven to work in both the clinic and in the manufacturing facility , the impact on the treatment of diabetes will be a medical game - changer on a par with antibiotics and bacterial infections			1
' @entity174 , a diabetes expert at the @entity175 , said the research ' will leave a dent in the history of diabetes ' , adding : ' this is a phenomenal accomplishment			0
' dr @entity181 , of the @entity182 , which part - funded the research , cautioned that it had so far proved its worth only on mice			0
but he added : ' if you could get people off insulin completely , it would change their lives			0
' dr @entity77 said his children had taken the news in their stride , adding : ' i think like all kids , they always assumed that if i said i 'd do this , i 'd do it			2

research into a cure for diabetes could result in an end to insulin injections
it has been hailed as the biggest medical breakthrough since antibiotics
@entity29 researcher @entity77 promised his children he 'd find a cure
treatment involves making insulin - producing cells from stem cells
scientists hope to have human trials under way within a ' few years '
