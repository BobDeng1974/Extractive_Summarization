the retailer had maintained that the figures were sold in limited quantities in the adult - action - figure area of its stores			2
ms @entity8 said she was ' very shocked and appalled ' when she found the action figures in a toy shop			1
' i was very shocked and appalled , ' @entity8 told reporters about stumbling across the figures the popular show followed the transformation of mild - mannered high school teacher @entity27 into ruthless drug kingpin @entity51 when a diagnosis of terminal cancer forces him to cook meth as a means to secure his family 's future			2
both @entity27 and his business partner , @entity58 , played by @entity59 , have action figure versions completed with gas masks , a duffel bag of cash , and a toy bag of @entity51 's trademark blue crystal meth			1

' @entity13 is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages			0
