by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:46 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 02:37 est , 18 july 2013 sausage factory : @entity3 defended schools reforms plans against claims pupils were being over-tested @entity3 has defended plans for tougher tests for young pupils , insisting he did not want primary schools to become ' exam sausage factories '			1
the deputy prime minister insisted it was right for children 's academic ability to be tested as soon as they start primary school aged four or five			1
under the shake - up 11 - year - olds face being ranked against their peers across the country to better prepare children for secondary school			1
unions warned of a ' bureaucratic nightmare ' for teachers who would spend their time ' drilling ' pupils to pass exams			2
but mr @entity3 insisted : ' i do n’t want my children to become part of some exam sausage factory - far from it			1
' he said too many primary schools see pupils leave having already fallen behind their peers			1
he added : ' all we ’re saying is it ca n’t surely be right that under the current standards a school is deemed to be doing okay if four out of ten of the children who leave primary school are judged not to be ready to have a good start at secondary school			1
' this is not to try and either humiliate or celebrate , it ’s to give teachers and parents an idea of how that child measures up to other children in the school system			1
that ’s all it is			0
' i saw some comments from teaching unions this morning that somehow this was a lurch back to a name - and - shame approach , it ’s not at all			0
' so it ’s higher standards , more money , and the aspiration , the hope is simply to make sure everybody gets the best possible start in life			0
' the changes would see primaries having to ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school or risk triggering an @entity75 inspection			1
pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country , being put in 10 per cent achievement ‘ bands ’ , showing , for example , if they are in the top 10 per cent			1
the consultation document contains a reference to a ‘ new benchmark ’ to assess ‘ progress that has been made by 11 - year - olds ’			2
it says the ‘ baseline ’ test ‘ could be at age seven , as now , where teachers assess pupils ; or a simple check of a child ’s ability in the early weeks of a child ’s career at school ’			1
pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country , being put in achievement ' bands ' but teaching unions were critical of the plan , warning over-testing could be counter-productive			1
@entity104 , general secretary of the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) said : ' the government has a fondness for testing young children in the belief that the tests create reliable measures of performance			2
' and , by relying only on what can be measured , they risk missing what matters			0
there is far more to being ' secondary ready ' than a score on an hour 's test			2
a teacher 's judgment , built up over four years , has much to contribute			0
' @entity122 , general secretary of the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) said : ' it is difficult to see how a 25 p increase in the primary floor standard between 2010 and 2016 could be realistically achieved without wide - scale teaching to the test and other inappropriate drilling techniques			0
' @entity130 , general secretary of the @entity131 , said : ' school level assessments are fine in principle but in the context of current high stakes accountability , with no framework for support or provision of resources , the outcome is likely be a bureaucratic nightmare for teachers which could undermine high standards			2
' @entity75 chief sir @entity145 suggested last month that children should be tested in basic language and literacy even before they start formal education			0
he warned testing pupils at the end of their reception year was already too late , adding : ‘ children may have lost a vital year of learning by then			1
’ currently just 60 per cent of 11 - year - olds in a school are required to reach @entity157 4 in maths and @entity160 @entity159 – the standard expected of their age group			1
schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by mr @entity3 yesterday could be judged to be under - performing			1
they could be taken over and turned into academies			0
head of @entity75 sir @entity145 has called for children to be tested n basic language and literacy even before they start school the current marking system will also be axed , although its replacement has not been confirmed			0
the point at which children are judged to be on track to start secondary school will also be raised			0
at present , achieving @entity179 – the bottom third of the level 4 pass range – is considered acceptable			0
yet just 47 per cent of these children go on to get five good gcses , including maths and @entity160			0
mr @entity3 confirmed the pupil premium – extra funding for disadvantaged pupils – is to increase from £ 900 to £ 1,300 in primary schools from next year to help improve standards			1
around one in seven pupils qualify for the financial support			0
critics have previously voiced concerns about pupils spending too much time preparing for tests instead of learning at school			2
after taking national tests at seven , they sit more @entity159 in maths , @entity160 and science when they are 11			0
some take their first gcses the following year and complete them when they are 16 , making four sets of exams in ten years			0
as - levels and a-levels bring the total to six in 12 years			0
mr @entity3 ’s planned test would make it seven in 12 years .			2

testing at aged seven could be moved to first year of school
pupils aged 11 to be ranked against their peers across the country
primaries must ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school
@entity3 insists plan is ' not to try and either humiliate or celebrate '
pupil premium to rise from £ 900 to £ 1,300 per child from next year
