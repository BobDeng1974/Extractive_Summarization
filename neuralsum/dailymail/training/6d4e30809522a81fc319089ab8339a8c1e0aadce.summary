@entity0 raped a 17 - year - old as she tried to get home from a night club
she *borrowed* his phone and he *put* her in a taxi then raped her in a flat
the rape bore *similarities* to another attack he was convicted of in 2004
he had been out of prison for just over two years when he carried out the second rape last november
