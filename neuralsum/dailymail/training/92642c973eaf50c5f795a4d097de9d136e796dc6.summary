‘ they have no idea about the value of money … but they know from those people who have got through [ to @entity82 ] that … they can easily find work , do n’t have to declare their work , they can find accommodation and can get some money every week			2
' people who have got through call and say , … " this is @entity72 and we ’re staying here "			0
’ migrants are flocking to @entity4 in increasing numbers this year , with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift shelters as they wait to cross the @entity127			1

he said many drivers are threatened at knifepoint and forced to let people hide in their vehicles			0
anywhere within three hours drive of the port is considered a risk , he added			0
a row erupted this week after defence secretary @entity174 said that parts of the @entity3 were being ' swamped ' by migrants , only to retract the comment under pressure from @entity179			2
