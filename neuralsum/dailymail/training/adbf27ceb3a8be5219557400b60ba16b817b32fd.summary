by @entity0 published : 22:02 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 7 may 2013 the @entity2 is now a worse place to give birth than even @entity5 and @entity6 , according to research			1
@entity2 has failed to rank among the top 20 places to be a mother – coming in at a meagre number 23			1
researchers say the @entity2 ’s poor rating is partially down to higher infant and mother mortality rates than in other parts of @entity17			1
it means this country is now a worse place to have a baby than former @entity23 and @entity24 countries , which have seen rapid improvements in living standards			2
the @entity27 assesses mothers ' wellbeing using indicators of maternal health , under - five mortality , levels of women 's education , income , and political status			1
@entity2 is also four places below @entity38 , despite the country ’s economic turmoil			2
1 - @entity42 2 - @entity41 3 - @entity43 4 - @entity44 5 - @entity45 6 - @entity46 7 - @entity47 8 - @entity48 9 - @entity49 10 - @entity50 11 - @entity51 12 - @entity52 13 - @entity53 14 - @entity5 15 - @entity54 16 - @entity55 17 - @entity56 18 - @entity57 19 - @entity38 20 - @entity58 21 - @entity6 22 - @entity59 23 - @entity2 24 - @entity60 25 - @entity61 the table was compiled as part of @entity64 ’s @entity66 ’s mothers report , published today			1
in the @entity67 , which looks at how countries around the world are succeeding in saving the lives of mothers and newborn babies , @entity42 , @entity41 and @entity43 took the top three slots respectively			1
@entity58 ranked at number 20 , the @entity75 at number 30 , @entity49 at 9 and @entity55 number 16			0
last year , the @entity2 ranked 10th – but a spokesman for the charity said the criteria had changed since then so its fall to 23rd was not a fair like - for - like comparison			2
one of the main differences is that the number of indicators has been reduced from 12 to five			0
the index now assesses mothers ’ wellbeing using indicators of maternal health , under - five mortality and levels of women ’s education , income , and political status			2
the charity said : ‘ reducing the number of indicators shines a spotlight on what matters most in the lives of mothers and their children			0
‘ the indicators now primarily capture important outcomes			0
’ researchers said education was an important factor because children of educated women were more likely to survive and be healthy			2
political status was measured by recording the number of women in national government in each country			2
it is a factor because when women have a voice in politics , issues important to mothers and children are more likely to surface on the national agenda			0
income was measured as gross national income per capita and indicates how many resources the mother would have access to			0
coming in at number 23 , the @entity2 has fewer women in @entity127 and higher maternal and infant mortality rates than much of @entity17 , the charity said			1
@entity2 has failed to rank among the top 20 places to be a mother - coming in at a meagre number 23 women in @entity2 are at a higher risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth than women in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , according to the statistics			1
the report says a reason for this is the age women are having babies , with teenage and @entity149 pregnancy rates resulting in the @entity2 having a higher proportion of young and old mothers than much of @entity17			1
another reason is poverty and inequality			0
women with unemployed partners were six times more likely to die from maternal causes than those with partners in work			0
however , the @entity2 is also more robust than many @entity17 nations in collecting infant and maternal mortality data , which may contribute to comparatively higher rates			1
countries in @entity166 take up each of the bottom ten places in the index			0
in these countries , 10 to 20 per cent of mothers are underweight due to poor nutrition or underage pregnancy			0
the @entity174 ranks as the world ’s toughest place to be a mother			1
@entity178 , ceo of @entity64 , said : ‘ overall the world has made unprecedented progress in reducing child and maternal deaths			0
‘ but there are two big challenges : newborn [ deaths ] and malnutrition			0
’ the charity said that globally , one million babies die each year on the day they are born – or two every minute – making the first day by far the riskiest day of a person ’s life			0
a baby in the developing world is seven times as likely to die on its first day than one born in industrialised nations			2
a baby born in the @entity2 has a roughly 1 in 200 chance of dying before its fifth birthday , higher than in @entity201 or @entity61 .			1

@entity27 rated @entity42 as best place to have baby
@entity174 was found to be the world 's toughest place to be a mother
@entity2 women are at a higher risk of death in childbirth than women in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140
