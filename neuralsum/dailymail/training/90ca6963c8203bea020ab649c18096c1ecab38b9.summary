by @entity0 published : 16:13 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 16:14 est , 8 september 2013 switching on breakfast television last week , i was startled to see @entity4 editor @entity3 discussing a ' school 's initiative ' of which she 's part			1
at first , i thought that instead of jetting around the world attending fashion shows in new season heavily discounted or free designer gear , ms @entity3 herself would be making appearances at comprehensive schools the length and breadth of the land			1
but no , it turns out that all @entity4 is doing is sending out a video and lesson plan to schools for teachers of @entity23 pupils ( aged 13 to 14 ) to use in order to unravel , explain and put into context the smoke and mirrors that go into the making of its glossy pages			1
in @entity4 : @entity31 on holiday ( right ) and on the cover of the june issue or rather to peddle its wares in a scheme perfectly timed to coincide with the latest round of international fashion shows			1
let me unveil just what @entity4 's curriculum consists of			1
@entity3 's lesson plan asks that teachers tell students that ' only a very small percentage of the population have the natural build and appearance of a model '			1
it details each stage of a fashion magazine shoot			2
it lists , too , for teachers to read out unquestioningly , the diverse , ' normal ' people who have been shot by @entity4 , including @entity56 - without mentioning that the magazine failed to show any other part of her body than her carefully airbrushed head ! it is , frankly , laughable			1
what all this amounts to is not @entity4 admitting that it needs to evolve , and respect its readers a little more			1
instead , they are asking young women to change their response to what they see in @entity4 - to change a response that is often visceral , emotional and unwitting			2
@entity3 says the pictures in her magazine ' aspire and entertain ' , but she 's being disingenuous			1
they are designed to sell things			0
if readers were to disbelieve the dream they were sold - that if they wear a certain dress , they , too , will look like a model , and get a boyfriend , and find happiness - then @entity4 would go out of business			2
it 's as simple as that			2
laughable : vogue editor @entity3 on breakfast tv last week - her ' school 's initiative ' reveals how little the magazine respects its readers i do n't buy @entity3 's premise that what @entity4 , and other magazines , designers , photographers and post-production studio wizards are doing is fantasy , and somehow to be separated from real life			1
fashion is seductive and convincing			1
it chip , chip , chips away at our self - esteem			0
not every young woman 's self - esteem , of course			2
if you have a protective bubble of a loving family , and good friends , and eagle - eyed teachers , then you have a chance to repel these images , like a very good @entity114 mac. but for @entity3 to say ' the problem , if there is a problem , comes when people judge themselves against the models they see on the pages of a magazine and then feel that in some way they fall short ' is staggering			1
i know from experience that even being fully aware of the reality behind these images - seeing first hand that models have thread veins and acne , that images can be airbrushed , with heads being placed on entirely different bodies ( it 's revealed in the short film that it takes 20 professionals to produce one photo ) - does not help			2
it can not reverse what has been affected in the deepest part of your brain , the reptilian cortex buried inside your head , that ' does not respond to talking therapies ' ( thank you , @entity147 , professor in psychiatry at @entity149 )			0
and the rational part of your brain , the bit that understands @entity31 does n't really look as she does on the june cover of @entity4 , can not override the subconscious that says you simply do not measure up			2
i was taught to hate my body by an industry that i loved , but that never loved me back			0
it 's crushing to see my story being repeated , over and over again , by girls coming after me , who believe the same lies that @entity3 repeats in this new film : oh , it 's fantasy , you are not supposed to want to look like these cover girls , they are just an escape , not an aspiration			1
yes , we do need education about this sort of thing in schools			0
but not from the gamekeepers , the very people who have so much to lose from opening our eyes to their sophistry			0
small and quiet : @entity180 's shop scores well the legendary @entity180 is celebrating 40 years of the wrap dress next year with a new , capsule collection for spring 2014			2
actually , the wrap dress was really born in 1972 ( who says designers were ever good at sums )			0
it was inspired by the needs of the feminist movement : light and made of unwrinkling silk jersey , the wrap worked in the office , was easily squished into a suitcase , and could be put on or stepped out of in seconds			0
' simplicity and sexiness , that 's what people want			0
at a price that 's not outrageous , ' @entity180 told @entity4 in 1976			1
when i visit , the shop is small and quiet , with polite , eager sales assistants , and a couple of customers whose faces have been pulled taut			0
the thing is , today the wrap dress - meant to be worn over a tan and cowboy boots , with @entity212 's hair and the sheen of youth - has instead been adopted by @entity215 , and can be frumpy if you do n't accessorise it with killer heels			0
there are lots of variations on offer here , priced from £ 300 to £ 500 , but the most ubiquitous seem to be in leopard or snake print			0
i like the fact a designer has a @entity227 , and sticks to it : @entity180 's body con dresses and lace shifts work less well			0
and , of course , you can buy variations on the wrap everywhere , from @entity234 to @entity235			0
@entity180 only loses one point for the very pedestrian , @entity239 shoes			0

new ' school 's initiative ' to teach girls what goes into making glossy images
@entity4 editor @entity3 *argues* that fashion is fantasy
she fails to understand how seductive and convincing fashion can be
