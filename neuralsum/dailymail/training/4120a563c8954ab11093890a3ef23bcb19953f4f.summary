by @entity0 reports that multi-millionairess @entity3 , formerly @entity4 is moving to @entity5 to help her husband in the kitchen of his new restaurant are to be taken lightly – but to be honest , these days , it would n't exactly shock me if this actually happened			1
billionaire businesswoman and reality star @entity11 , married just at the weekend to her unemployed baby daddy @entity13 , is already signing off on @entity14 as @entity15			2
@entity16 , currently beleaguered with rumours of marriage woes , named her previous tour , not ' @entity20 ' but ' the mrs @entity21 '			2
@entity0 says women like @entity3 , who have built up their own career , should n't have to drop it or take a backseat to please their man @entity28 , massively famous in friends at the time , legally became mrs @entity28 after her marriage to @entity31 , and sent out all personal correspondence for years on stylish ' @entity28 ' stationery			1
and whilst opinion formers now work overtime to reclaim the word ' feminism ' , there is a distinct trend going on right now - and it feels a little old school to me			0
yes , it 's about taking his name in public , but it 's more than that			0
there 's a whole lot of deferring happening in @entity51 these days			0
sometimes it feels like a return to the @entity54 – making sure to always take into account your man 's feelings and yes , his ego			1
not too long ago , @entity28 is rumoured to have moved the entire production of @entity61 from @entity62 to @entity63 in order to be closer to fiancé @entity65 , who lived there			0
actress @entity67 dutifully follows husband @entity68 from red carpet to red carpet supporting his career - actor @entity71 even recently implied he and @entity28 are no longer friends because @entity68 was n't comfortable with it fashionista and actress @entity74 skipped @entity76 ( forfeiting a mid-six figures in fees ) for the first time ever , in order to visit her new husband @entity81 , then filming in @entity83			1
actress @entity67 dutifully follows hubby @entity68 from red carpet to red carpet supporting his career ; and actor @entity71 recently implied he and @entity28 are no longer friends because hubby @entity68 was n't comfortable with it			1
after they began dating @entity89 immediately promoted former boyfriend and back up dancer @entity89 to ' tour / choreographer manager ' bestowing a generous raise and including him at all major red carpet events			0
@entity0 believes more women are taking a backseat to make their husbands feel like ' the man ' @entity99 recently told her multi-million dollar reality show mom - ager @entity101 , this about her career : ' @entity103 comes first			1
' indeed it seems that more and more famous women are taking a back seat in order to make their man feel like ' the man '			1
just like @entity109 before them , books like @entity111 and @entity112 , can certainly provoke a hefty amount of eye rolling			0
the underlying principle of course being that the control women wield at work and with children must be left at the front door of any happy marriage			2
with this in mind , as divorce rates remain high , and discontented marriages abound , some of the world 's most famously strong and powerful women appear to be working overtime to put their men firmly out in front			1
it is likely that @entity133 will always be more famous than her handsome @entity135 husband – and likely , although it 's continues to be widely reported he ' comes from a wealthy family ' she will always have more money			2
but by taking his name so publicly and immediately she 's making a statement ( as well as conveniently losing that last reminder of her errant ex ) , that she belongs to him			0
she 's also said to have refused to sign a pre-nup and is already learning @entity135			0
jumping in with both feet as she is , with a clear indication of her certainty and commitment , let 's hope it 's a promising sign for a marriage and a commitment based on just three months of togetherness .			0

@entity0 says that more female *celebrities* are putting their man first
says women should n't have to drop their lives to please their husband
she is sick of seeing powerful women *trailing* around after *partners*
