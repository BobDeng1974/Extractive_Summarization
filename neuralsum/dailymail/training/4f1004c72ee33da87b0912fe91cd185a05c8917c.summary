he pointed out that it is legal and does n't believe a school can tell him where he can work			2
the debacle began two weeks ago when fellow students at @entity25 discovered his videos on an adult website and started showing each other the explicit images on their phones			1
exposed : @entity9 's role in adult films came to light when other students spotted him in porn movies legal : but he insists that the job is no different from any other , saying it was legal and outside of school the website shows @entity9 , who goes by the name of ' @entity59 ' , posing naked and having sex with other men , as well as featuring in an introductory video about his love of surfing			1
