' @entity9 said that he feels similar to @entity10 in many ways and added : ' he is a fighter like me who never gives up			2
i could really see that in the jungle when he just kept following us			0
' it is insane when you think about it			0
he jumped in the water when he thought that we were leaving him and was in my canoe for 14 hours down the river			0
' like me , he has never had a free ride in life , i have struggled , he has struggled , that binds us together			0
' @entity9 , who collected @entity10 with his wife @entity63 and daughter @entity63 , revealed the family had found it difficult whilst waiting for the pup to be freed from quarantine			1

this dog has been through enough in his life , now begins the fun part for him			0

now he is healthy and recovered fully when @entity9 and his team first encountered the pup and felt sorry for him , they fed him a meatball and the animal started to follow them - and did n't stop			2

the world championships held in @entity5 covered three diverse geographical regions - the @entity132 , the @entity133 and the @entity135 rainforest			1
he swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers , dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee - deep mud during treks			0
even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave			2
the fifth member : @entity11 met @entity10 during the gruelling race and he refused to leave their side all terrains : despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of @entity10 , primarily for his own safety , he refused to go			1
it meant when he got stuck in the knee - deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted , they stopped to take a break support : at one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle , so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food loyal : @entity10 became a loyal member of the team and refused to leave their side on their trek before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organisers warned the team that taking @entity10 along posed a risk to his and their safety			1
they tried to set off without him , but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling			0
@entity118 , heartbroken by the site of @entity10 struggling in the water , picked him up , put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey			1
@entity10 was originally scheduled to leave quarantine on february 5 to undergo surgery , but the request was denied at the last minute because he still was n't considered to be in good enough health by the @entity23			2
the team agreed with the decision to keep @entity10 in quarantine and also praised the quarantine 's staff for doing an ' amazing job ' with their new best friend			1
today , as the family welcomed @entity10 to his new home , @entity9 said : ' he is really happy to be with us			1
this morning when we came to pick him up he jumped around , gave us kisses and lay down so we could scratch his stomach			0

' he will be loved by our small family and all of our friends			1
we have made him a space with cushions where he can sleep , and have bought food , trays , loads of toys and everything else a dog might need			0
' resting : when the team slept , devoted @entity10 would also curl up and take a nap alongside them determined : before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking @entity10 along posed a risk to his and their safety			2
