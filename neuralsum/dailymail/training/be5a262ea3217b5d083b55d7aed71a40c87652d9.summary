by @entity0 hundreds of babies may be dying on @entity3 labour wards every year due to a severe lack of staff , a top doctor has warned			2
dr @entity7 , president of the @entity8 , said it was ‘ legitimate ’ to ask whether it was the reason for notoriously high rates of mortality and brain damage			1
figures show that 300 babies die a year during birth or shortly after with a further 1,200 suffering brain damage or other major health problems			2
deaths : dr @entity7 said many mothers are still ' losing their babies unnecessarily ' at the same time @entity3 maternity wards remain desperately understaffed and can not cope with the baby boom coupled with births becoming more complicated due to older and more obese women			1
dr @entity7 , who represents @entity28 ’s 6,000 obstetricians , said : ‘ we need to look at the possibility that understaffing , labour wards that are under pressure and busy , and stretched facilities may be a factor in some of these poor outcomes			1
’ he added that there were occasions when staff made ‘ small , relatively innocuous mistakes [ which ] , when combined , lead to a disaster			2
’ dr @entity7 also criticised @entity28 ’s high rate of stillbirth – almost 4,000 a year or about 10 a day – as an ‘ appalling ’ and largely preventable loss of life			1
it is the third highest rate out of 35 high income countries – only @entity47 and @entity48 are worse			1
he said that although the numbers have fallen recently , ‘ it ’s still a lot of mums in the 21st century that are losing their babies unnecessarily			1
’ and figures for 2009 – the latest year available – showed that 144 babies died during labour with a further 134 dying within a week of the birth			0
the birth rate in @entity28 has risen by 22 per cent in the last decade and dr @entity7 said maternity units were being ‘ squeezed ’ because the numbers of doctors and nurses has not kept pace			1
he said there needed to be an extra 800 consultants to provide care round the clock and intervene when complications arise during the labour			0
' squeezed ' : dr @entity7 said the number of doctors and nurses has not kept pace with the rising birth rate ‘ if you need to have a consultant there at three in the afternoon , why is it not equally important to have a consultant there at three o’clock in the morning ? in my view it is , ’ he told the @entity74			1
but he admitted that a lack of @entity3 funding meant there was no realistic realistic possibility of consultant numbers rising from 2,200 to the ideal of 3,000			1
he also called for action to reduce the 1,200 ‘ near misses ’ which occur every year when complications occur during labour and birth that often leave the baby temporarily but dangerously deprived of oxygen			0
the condition , which doctors call ‘ severely hypoxic , ’ involves babies facing the risk of brain damage and profound lifelong disability			1
‘ these are babies that are born in very poor condition and may have a very slow heartbeat or very restricted breathing or not respond to stimulation , ’ he said			0
dr @entity7 said : ' lots and lots of women travel through pregnancy and labour safely but occasional tragedy occurs ' each such case can leave the @entity3 having to find millions of pounds in compensation to pay for the substantial cost of providing lifetime care for the child			1
he said the loss of life and long term injuries that resulted from these complications represent ‘ 1,500 individual tragedies ’ and constitute ‘ an ongoing tragedy involving potentially avoidable very serious outcomes			0
’ asked why the baby deaths occur , @entity126 replied : “ the best analogy is to describe them as plane crashes			0
‘ lots and lots of women travel through pregnancy and labour safely but occasional tragedy occurs			0
' these tragedies are always ‘ multifactorial ’ and require thorough investigation to establish why			0
it is not uncommon that a series of small relatively innocuous mistakes , when combined , lead to a disaster , ’ he said			0
‘ there are often no easy fixes			0
the challenge is to be willing to share these experiences , learn from each other and invest in safety			0
‘ there is a big difference : flights are often cancelled for safety reasons – medical emergencies during pregnancy and labour ca n’t be cancelled			0
’ in addition to the lack of doctors , the @entity153 has estimated the @entity3 needs an extra 5,000 midwives to guarantee safe care			1
dr @entity159 , the health minister , said childbirth on the @entity3 was safe and perinatal mortality was declining			2
‘ the numbers of stillbirths and infant mortalities are at the lowest levels since 1993 , but there is still more to do			2
' the @entity3 is a safe place to give birth , with women reporting high levels of trust and confidence in staff			2

dr @entity7 , president of the @entity8 criticised the death rate in @entity28 *'s* *hospitals*
he said *insufficient* numbers of doctors and nurses may be to blame
said high rate of stillbirth is ' appalling ' and largely preventable
