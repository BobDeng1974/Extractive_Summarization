by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 13:30 est , 15 july 2013 a labrador and a golden retriever – named @entity3 and @entity4 - have become the first dogs in the country to look after dementia sufferers			1
the pair has been drafted in to help @entity9 , 79 , and @entity10 , 69 , who were both diagnosed with dementia three years ago			1
as their conditions have deteriorated , their dependence on respective partners @entity16 , 66 , and @entity17 , 74 , has increased - until now			0
@entity3 and @entity4 - who moved into the homes in march – know to carry out certain tasks when they hear the sounds			1
the dogs are able to pull off a duvet to wake up the person , bark , and nudge the person			0
but one of the most important tasks is to respond to an alert which informs them to pick up a pouch with medication in it and take it to their owner			0
mrs will , from @entity51 , @entity52 , who has been married to mr will for over 40 years , said : ‘ the results have been unbelievable - we 've got a lot more from this than we ever expected			2
‘ to some it might look like we 've just got a new pet , but it 's no word of lie to say we 've got our life back now we have @entity3			1
the dogs have been drafted in to help @entity9 , 79 ( pictured with his wife @entity62 and @entity63 ) , and @entity10 , 69 , who were both diagnosed with dementia three years ago @entity3 and @entity4 know how to carry out a range of different tasks when they are alerted by the sound of an alarm			1
for example , they can wake up their owners by pulling the duvets off their beds ‘ we are going out so much more with the dog and meeting so many new people			0
we do n't have to lock the door to keep @entity9 inside now			2
‘ the condition has had a big impact on our lives			0
@entity9 used to get very angry and aggressive but when he sees the dog he forgets about all his problems and has a smile on his face			2
‘ @entity3 is the first thing he sees in the morning and he will bring a toy to @entity9 straight away and it just lightens the atmosphere from the beginning			1
‘ @entity3 is also great with nudging @entity9 every now again to stop him falling asleep , so it helps him keep a lot more active and happier than he did before			2
one of the most important tasks the dogs carry out is to respond to an alert which informs them to pick up a pouch with medication in it and take it to their owner after the successes of @entity104 and @entity4 , another two puppies have started training to join the programme ‘ he will also bring @entity9 his medication whenever the alarm goes off , so it means i do n't have to be there all the time to look after him			1
‘ people just do n't understand how hard it is living with someone who has dementia			0
but this scheme has really worked and i hope it can be rolled out across the world			0
‘ every morning i would get up and think to myself “ i wonder what problems today will bring ? ” , but not anymore , we 're so much happier			0
’ mr @entity17 added : ‘ @entity10 and i ca n't imagine going back to what it was like before we got @entity4			1
’ the project was the brainchild of students at @entity125 and was developed by @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128 last year			0
after the successes of @entity104 and @entity4 , another two puppies have started training to join the programme			2
the project was the brainchild of students at @entity125 and was developed by @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128 last year the ' dementia dogs ' spend the first year of their life with a dog handler to be socialised before going on to specialist training they spend their first year with experienced volunteers , learning to be well - behaved and well - mannered young dogs			1
at just over a year old , they will move into a specialised training centre , where they learn their new duties			0
@entity144 , director of training at @entity127 said : ‘ for 25 years we 've been training assistance dogs for physically disabled adults and children and more recently for children with autism			1
‘ this new project has provided us all with an opportunity to bring together our skills and experience to help with a different kind of challenge			0
‘ we really believe that the dementia assistance dog could make a significant contribution to the government 's @entity158			2

@entity9 , 79 , and @entity10 , 69 , have been given assistance dogs
say they have finally ' got their lives back ' because they can socialise again
@entity3 and @entity4 are the first ' dementia dogs ' in the country that listen to a set of alarms that tell them to carry out specific tasks
@entity174 's @entity52 are now training 2 more puppies to do the same job
