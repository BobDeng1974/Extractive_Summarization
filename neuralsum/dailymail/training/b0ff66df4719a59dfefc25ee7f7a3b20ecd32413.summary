by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:35 est , 11 april 2013 updated : 04:40 est , 12 april 2013 @entity3 ' most serious gun - control effort in years passed the first step towards legalization on thursday as the @entity6 pushed past conservatives ' attempted blockade under the teary gaze of families of victims of december 's @entity13 school shootings			1
the bipartisan 68 - 31 vote rebuffed an effort to keep debate from even starting , giving an early victory - and perhaps political momentum - to president @entity19 and his gun control allies			1
four months after 20 first - graders and six staffers at @entity27 in @entity27 were killed , relatives watching the vote from a gallery overlooking the @entity6 floor dabbed at tears and clasped hands , some seeming to pray			1
several weeks of emotional , unpredictable @entity6 debate lie ahead , and a mix of gun - rights amendments , opposition from the @entity61 and skepticism from @entity65 @entity64 leaders leave big questions about what will emerge from @entity3			1
today the bill passed through the @entity6 with bi-partisan support			1
it still needs to be approved by the @entity65 in @entity3 before becoming law , but if it is passed it will : foes of the proposed new restrictions say they would penalize law - abiding citizens and do nothing to curb gun violence			1
' the hard work starts now , ' said senate majority leader @entity78 , the @entity79 who brought the legislation to the floor for debate			0
still , in a @entity3 marked by a notable lack of cooperation between @entity86 and @entity64 , thursday 's vote was one of several displays of unusual rapport across party lines			0
hoping to bring pressure on @entity3 to act on gun control , supporters of new restrictions have been demonstrating in @entity95			1
they have erected a mock graveyard with thousands of crosses on the @entity98 , symbolizing victims of gun violence			2
starting in : volunteer @entity101 begins putting some of the crosses in the lawn of the @entity98 early thursday morning hours before the background check bill passed its first hurdle in @entity3 big numbers : all told , there were 3,300 markers on the @entity98 as that is the number of people affected by gun violence in the @entity112 since december 14 , the date of the @entity27 shooting making an impact : gun control advocates set up a display of crosses and @entity119 on the @entity98 as a mock cemetery to show how many people lose their lives to guns the @entity6 's firearms bill would subject nearly all gun buyers to background checks , add muscle to federal laws by barring illicit firearm sales and provide slightly more money for school safety measures			1
excluded and facing near - certain defeat in upcoming votes were proposals to ban military - style weapons and high - capacity ammunition magazines - factors in the @entity27 killings some other recent mass shootings			0
but keeping those provisions out of the current legislation did not mollify critics			0
opponents said the remaining proposals were unwarranted intrusions on the second amendment right to bear arms , would be ignored by criminals and would do little to prevent future @entity148			0
@entity19 's plans have received scant support from @entity64 and many moderate @entity86 , with many saying they prefer improvements in dealing with the mentally ill and stronger enforcement of existing laws			2
hoping for momentum : @entity155 , a mother who lost a relative to gun violence , is one of the many people who have been pushing for attention to be paid to the @entity27 relatives proposals ' i 'm not interested in a symbolic gesture which would offer the families of the @entity27 shootings no real solutions that they seek , ' said senator @entity165 of @entity166 , the @entity6 's second - leading @entity64			1
@entity3 has n't approved major gun restrictions since enacting an assault weapons ban 19 years ago , a prohibition that lawmakers let lapse after a decade			2
some potential amendments could broaden gun rights and weaken supporters ' backing for the overall bill			1
one proposal is by @entity178 senator @entity178 and @entity86 senator @entity179 who say it would improve how the federal background check system blocks weapons from going to people with certain mental problems , though critics say it would make it harder in some cases to do so			2
another possible amendment would require states to recognize permits for carrying concealed weapons issued by other states			0
in thursday 's vote , 50 @entity86 and 2 @entity86 - leaning independents were joined by 16 @entity64 in voting to begin debate on the legislation			0
support : @entity86 senator @entity198 from @entity199 has been one of the strongest advocates for pushing through the more strict gun control laws proximity : @entity199 's @entity198 was joined alongside @entity13 senator @entity203 when he addressed the press and the @entity27 relatives twenty - nine @entity64 and two @entity86 facing re-election next year in @entity64 - leaning states voted ' no ' - @entity209 's @entity179 and @entity208 of @entity210			1
after the roll call , @entity19 spoke by phone with some @entity27 families and said he would ' keep fighting for the votes they deserve , ' said @entity217 spokesman @entity216			0
the @entity6 plans to debate an amendment tuesday expanding background checks less broadly than the overall legislation would			1
broadening the system to cover more transactions is the heart of the current effort on guns			0
that amendment , a compromise between @entity228 senator @entity228 and @entity86 senator @entity229 would subject buyers in commercial settings like gun shows and the internet to the checks but exempt non-commercial transactions like sales between friends and relatives			2
reaching out : @entity86 senator @entity229 from @entity239 met with @entity27 in his office			0
he was one of the leaders on the background check bill that was approved in @entity3 today that accord , unveiled wednesday , was designed to build bipartisan support for the legislation and seemed likely to do so			1
@entity228 and @entity229 are among the most conservative members of their parties and are both gun owners with @entity61 ratings of @entity251 , which is the highest that the gun lobbyist awards			0
@entity228 said thursday he believes supporters of his compromise with @entity229 would be able to beat back any filibuster attempt			0
' beyond that , i just do n't know yet , ' he said on ' @entity258			0
' gun - control groups have embraced the @entity229 - @entity228 compromise with varying degrees of enthusiasm , and they continued to applaud it on thursday - while also expressing concerns about some provisions			2
possible roadblock : skepticism from @entity65 @entity64 leaders like house speaker @entity269 leave big questions about what will emerge from @entity3 besides the exemption for private sales , gun control advocates expressed displeasure with language letting gun dealers sell handguns to out - of - state customers , exempting some holders of permits for concealed weapons from background checks and shielding individuals who sell guns from some negligence lawsuits			1
' we are optimistic that this bill will make a dramatic difference in reducing gun violence , ' said @entity291 , president of the @entity292			2
the @entity61 said it opposed the @entity229 - @entity228 compromise and warned senators that it would count votes on provisions it opposes in its evaluation of candidates that it provides its members , who the organization says number nearly 5 million .			0

gun control bill passes in @entity6 with bipartisan support
calls for nearly *universal* background checks and smaller *additions*
now heads to @entity65 , which may be rockier
