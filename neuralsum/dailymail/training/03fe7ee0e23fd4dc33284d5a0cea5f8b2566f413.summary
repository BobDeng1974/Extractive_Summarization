a marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the @entity6 coast - insisting the image is probably a well - doctored hoax			1
residents of @entity8 were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town 's harbour			1
but sea - life expert dr @entity13 , who has worked on logging new species of crab , says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big			1
this image of @entity21 harbour from above led to claims that a ' @entity23 ' could be living off the @entity6 coast the image ( left ) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the @entity29 , but marine biologist dr @entity13 ( right ) says the picture is a hoax dr @entity33 , an @entity34 and @entity35 researcher at the @entity36 , said : ' the idea of a giant " crabzilla " would very exciting			1
unfortunately , i think this is a hoax			0
' i do n't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand , but i think it 's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo			0
' she added : ' the @entity51 does have large crabs			0
the biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size , but they tend to stay in much deeper water , about 1,000 - metres deep , and are a different shape from the image in this photo			2
' crabs with a " pie crust edge " , like the one in the crabzilla image , are known as edible crabs , or @entity64 , but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres			0
' mocked - up photos poking fun at the idea of a @entity23 were posted on @entity68 after the image emerged the largest crabs in @entity51 waters are spider crabs , which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep edible crabs , shaped like the one in the aerial photo of @entity8 , grow to only 30 centimetres long dr @entity33 added : ' the largest crabs in the world are @entity79 spider crabs , which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size , about as big as a small car , but again , they tend to stay in deep water and do n't come ashore			1
' crabs are amazing because they are so diverse , we have about 60 species around the @entity51 , and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found , but i laughed when i saw this picture			2
' the photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called @entity93 , a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town			0
the image has sparked a rash of less believable online images , with @entity68 users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water .			0

@entity8 resident claimed he saw large creature while crabbing with *son*
