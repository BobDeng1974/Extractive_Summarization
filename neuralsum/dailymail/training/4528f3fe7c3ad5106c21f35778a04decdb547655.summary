her ' sha - mazing ' performance on the show won her countless new fans - many of whom gaped at her dazzling dresses on the show week after week			2
and now , the sha - mazing star herself has revealed just what she 's going to be wearing this 25 december : a pair of not - so glamorous @entity17			1
the suck - me - in control pants have fast become the go - to garment for celebrities and regular folk alike looking to banish the bulge and avoid the dreaded @entity24 - and they are now set to make up @entity26 's @entity25 look too			1
dazzling : @entity26 does n't look to be in need of @entity17 - but the star says she loves the control pants - whether she 's wearing them under these @entity5 gowns is as yet unconfirmed even slender young stars like @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 admit to wearing them , and everyone from princess @entity36 to @entity37 via @entity38 has inadvertently flashed a glimpse of their @entity17			1
so if nothing else , @entity26 , 34 , is in excellent company			2
the star told closer magazine she would be pairing her control pants with a push - up bra			1
' i 'll be wearing @entity17 and a great bra to lift up those puppies ! ' she said in an interview with the magazine			1

' breakfast is boiled egg with toast , lunch is a chicken and salad wrap , dinner is wholewheat pasta or sushi			0
' @entity26 tells closer that she snacks on raw nuts , bananas and sugar - free hot chocolate , and avoids alcohol apart from the occasional glass of wine with her dinner			0
she keeps her weakness for crumpets , chocolate , sweets , cheese and cakes in check by enjoying them once in a while , but not over-indulging			0
her rule of thumb ? do n't deny yourself anything - it will only make you want it more			0
and despite her fondness for a sequinned dress , @entity26 plans to keep it real on christmas eve			0
her festive outfit is a funny @entity25 jumper and jeans for @entity104 , and comfy clothes on christmas day			2
her one concession to smart ? she will wear a classy outfit for church on christmas day			0
' it 's not a time for latex ! ' she jokes			0
