in what has to be one of the most emotional press conferences ever given by a sportsman , @entity4 captain @entity1 , paid tribute to @entity6 on behalf of his team and @entity8 on saturday morning at the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
from the moment @entity1 sat down and said to the gathered press , ' i 'll do my best , guys ' , it was clear just how much he was hurting and how hugely emotional it was going to be for him to read the statement at all			1
struggling to keep his composure , @entity1 took deep breaths and wept , as he paid a massive tribute to his close friend and team mate @entity6			1
' to @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 ( @entity6 ' family ) , we share in the deep pain that you 're feeling			1
' @entity1 began to breakdown in tears at this point , but was able to compose himself			1
' apart from when he was at home on the farm with his beloved cattle , @entity39 was at his happiest playing cricket for his country with his mates , ' he continued			0
' things were always put into perspective when @entity39 said : ' where would you rather be boys than playing cricket for your country '			0
' still struggling to keep his emotions in check , @entity1 sighed audibly before continuing			2
' we 're going to miss that cheeky grin and twinkle in his eye , ' he said			1
' he epitomised what the baggy green is about and what it means to us all			0
' the world lost one of its great blokes this week and we are all poorer for it			0
' the @entity4 captain sobbed throughout as he gave his statement inconsolable : a shattered @entity1 tries to gather himself ' our dressing room will never be the same			1
we love him and always will			0
rest in peace bruzzy , ' said @entity1 @entity1 's emotional reaction may now call into further doubt @entity71 's first test against @entity72 in @entity73 on thursday as the final decision on whether it will go ahead is being left up to the players @entity1 regularly took deep breaths to help get him through the press conference @entity1 promised @entity6 ' family that they would do ' everything we can to honour his memory '			1
he then confirmed that @entity6 ' international one - day shirt number , 64 , would be retired by @entity8			1
' that means so much , ' he said			0
@entity1 added that @entity6 ' ' legacy of trying to improve each and every day will drive us for the rest of our lives '			1
after thanking everyone ' here and overseas for the touching tributes to @entity39 ' , @entity1 paused for what seemed an age to compose himself again , before ending the statement by saying in a breaking voice : ' our dressing room will never be the same			2
we love him and always will			0
' the 25 - year - old @entity6 died on thursday after being struck by a bouncer during a @entity101 game on tuesday			2
@entity1 struggled to read the statement on on behalf of the national team and support staff at the @entity9 @entity1 looked mentally and physically exhausted after finishing his statement a visibly upset @entity1 is helped away after the press conference at @entity9 on saturday @entity8 announced on saturday evening that @entity71 's match against @entity108 will not go ahead , with the final decision left up to the players			1
but the fact that @entity6 ’ family want the match to go ahead – as it is what he would have wanted – could make the crucial difference			2
throughout the whole tragic saga of @entity6 ’ freak accident and death , it has been the wishes of the family that both @entity4 cricketers and team management have strictly abided by			1
@entity6 ( left ) and his father @entity30 celebrate @entity71 's victory against @entity126 in 2009 in @entity127			1

they would like the first test against @entity108 to be played on thursday			0
the @entity6 family are set to play a part in whether next week 's first test in @entity73 takes place @entity140 reported that although the players ’ feelings had to be respected after such a bereavement – the family ’s wishes will have a huge bearing on the decision to play			1

according to the report , the match would then start after lunch			0
for now the @entity157 is taking direction from @entity8 ( @entity8 ) regarding the first test , and @entity8 is naturally proceeding cautiously with emotions still so raw			2
speaking moments after captain @entity1 and opening batsman @entity170 arrived at the @entity9 for a team meeting on friday , @entity8 ceo @entity168 said cricket would go on ' when it 's ready '			1
' the starting point is [ the players ] are grieving and they ’ve lost someone that ’s incredibly close to them , and i think there ’s enough that we understand about grieving processes to know that it ’s really important to give people time , ' mr @entity168 said			0
‘ to be honest they ’ve got other things on their mind and i know for many people seven days does n’t seem very far away , next thursday , but in other ways it ’s a million miles away , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ll get there when we can			0
’ @entity8 ceo @entity168 looks at a floral tribute after speaking to the media at the @entity9 on friday however , although the merits of playing , delaying or abandoning the start of a four - @entity151 series against @entity108 are still being considered , there are other realities			2
the series is a huge money spinner for organisers and sponsors , particularly in @entity108 , where millions of fanatical cricket fans have been waiting for the series all year			0
@entity72 cricket officials have already had to back down after initially saying that friday ’s tour match against the @entity207 had to go ahead			0
‘ postponed because of one player ? i do n’t think so , ’ a spokesman for the @entity209 told @entity210			0
