by @entity0 published : 09:05 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 20 february 2013 he was only trying his best to halt a spate of car crashes outside his business , but ended up in court			0
@entity7 , 57 , landlord of the coach and @entity10 pub in @entity11 , @entity12 , simply moved an arrow pointing to two nearby car parks and for weeks afterwards there were no more incidents			1
but then council officials moved the sign back and within days there was another collision on the road			1
again he moved the sign with the same success , but again the council undid his good work			1
problem recognised : pub landlord @entity7 , 57 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , moved an arrow pointing to two nearby car parks and for weeks afterwards there were no more incidents finally the council installed a camera to see who was changing the sign on the road and caught mr @entity7			1
the next thing he knew , the police arrived and charged him with causing £ 400 of damage			1
mr @entity7 has fought a running battle with council officials because the two - lane , one - way road running into the town past his pub has been a scene many crashes and near misses since 2009			1
he said the problem is that a sign pointing right to two car parks , one a multi-storey , confuses drivers who try to switch from one lane to the other while driving along @entity53 to make the turning			2
several have collided with other vehicles and there have been various near misses , mr @entity7 said			2
‘ on one occasion i was on the phone to the council when i heard a terrific screeching and when i looked outside , two cars had collided , ’ he said			2
‘ this problem has been going on for several years			0
’ ‘ but no - one will do anything about it			0
what does it need - someone to be badly injured , or killed ? it must have cost insurance companies tens of thousands of pounds to pay for repairs to vehicles damaged in these collisions			0
’ paint job : mr @entity7 has fought a running battle with council officials because the two - lane , one - way road running into the town past his pub has been a scene many crashes and near misses since 2009 he decided to take matters into his own hands and use a stepladder and paint scraper to climb up to the offending arrow and point it away from the car park , simply directing motorists to go straight on			1
' no - one will do anything about it			0
what does it need - someone to be badly injured , or killed ? it must have cost insurance companies tens of thousands of pounds to pay for repairs to vehicles damaged in these collisions ' @entity7 , pub landlord mr @entity7 said : ‘ it worked and for six weeks there was n't one collision or near miss. then the council sent workmen to turn the arrow around again and with two days there had been another collision			1
the sign confuses motorists and they just cross from one side of the road to other			2
that 's when problems start			0
’ after mr @entity7 moved the sign again the council eventually put up a camera on a lamp post to catch the culprit			1
‘ i knew it was there but that was n't going to stop me , ’ he said			0
after being caught on film mr @entity7 was charged with causing criminal damage to the sign			1
ironically the camera , which could have been used to monitor the traffic , has been removed			0
when he appeared at @entity124 to face the criminal damage charge , mr @entity7 was told that the case against him would be adjourned for two weeks			1
sorting it out : he decided to take matters into his own hands and use a stepladder and paint scraper to climb up to the offending arrow and point it away from the car park , simply directing motorists to go straight on it was so police could reconsider the allegation and possibly agree to issuing him with a caution			0
@entity140 , defending , said : ‘ problems with this sign have caused innumerable accidents			0
mr @entity7 has complained to the council and has met them and police but nothing has been done			1
‘ he moved the position of an arrow so that people who do not know @entity11 would drive straight on , rather than risking an accident by turning right			2
for six weeks there were no accidents			0
' our view is that there is no evidence of any potential threat to road safety , providing motorists exercise the due care and attention which the law and traffic regulation require ' @entity165 spokesman ' then the council turned the sign back again and within days there were more accidents			1
mr @entity7 moved the sign again and once again there were no accidents until the council turned the sign round again			1
he accepts that he has caused some minor damage to the sign			2
’ within minutes of the hearing ending , mr @entity7 was standing by the junction when two cars almost collided			2
‘ it is typical , ’ he said			0
‘ i am hauled to court because i try to help prevent accidents and the council put up a camera but then take it down when they have caught me , instead of leaving it there to monitor the junction			2
’ a @entity165 spokesman said today : ‘ the issue of this sign has been the subject of discussions both internally and with @entity193			0
‘ our view is that there is no evidence of any potential threat to road safety , providing motorists exercise the due care and attention which the law and traffic regulation require			0
’ sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
