the dark side of the moon could someday be home to human colonies if @entity4 has its way the @entity4 believes that conquering the moon is a crucial step for human deep space exploration			1
in a video , titled ' destination : moon ' , the agency outlines its plans for making a home on the hostile terrain that covers the far side of the lunar surface			1
pictured is an area known as the @entity27 basin ' in the future , the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins , to build a common future , and to share a common journey beyond , ' the video says			1
the moon is tidally locked to @entity38 , which means its near side always points towards our planet			2
until now , researchers have debated why this near side has an abundance of features - such as the ' @entity46 '			2
the man on the moon is in fact , dark maria , or seas – large flat areas of basalt on the moon ’s near side			0
no such features exist on far side of the moon ' in the future , the moon can become a place where the nations of the world can come together to understand our common origins , to build a common future , and to share a common journey beyond , ' the video says while parts of the moon are shrouded in darkness , its huge mountainous peaks are bathed in near - constant sunlight			1
@entity4 wants to send robots to these peaks , and eventually humans ( artist 's impression pictured ) the dark side , meanwhile , contains one of the largest impact crater in the solar system , dubbed the which is believed to have formed four billion years ago			1
the general consensus on the moon 's origin is that it probably formed shortly after @entity38 and was the result of a @entity83 - sized object hitting @entity38 with a glancing but devastating impact			0
this giant impact hypothesis suggests that the outer layers of @entity38 and the object were flung into space and eventually formed the moon			0
@entity38 and the impact object did not just melt ; parts of them vapourised , creating a disk of rock , magma and vapor around @entity38			2
the moon and @entity38 loomed large in each others skies when they formed			0
the geometry was similar to the rocky exoplanets recently discovered very close to their stars			0
the moon was 10 to 20 times closer to @entity38 than it is now , and the researchers found that it quickly assumed a tidally locked position - where the same side always faces our planet			0
the same real estate on the moon has probably always faced @entity38			0
tidal locking is a product of the gravity of both objects			0
its diameter is roughly 1,550 miles ( 2,500 km ) , making it stretches across nearly a quarter of the moon			0
while parts of the crater are shrouded in perpetual darkness , its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in near - constant sunlight			1
@entity4 wants to send robots to these peaks , and eventually humans			1
it says the crater 's rim is an ideal place to land humans because they have ' the potential for near continuous solar power and a spectacular view over the rugged and cratered landscape below			1
' ' here we will put into practice the lesson from years on the @entity138 , to establish a facility akin to those that we see in @entity142 today , ' it adds			0
in 2009 , @entity144 's @entity143 analysed the chemical composition of the material below the moon 's @entity27 and discovered traces of frozen water			2
@entity4 is hoping to find out if water exists elsewhere on the moon , and if so , they want to understand where it came found			1
if the moon has huge stores of water , future colonies could use the hydrogen and oxygen atoms to create rocket fuel			1
' [ this could ] propel us further into the solar system and onto the next destination of our journey into the cosmos , ' the video says			2
future missions could also use the far side of the moon as a shield against radio signals coming from @entity38 in order to look farther into space			0

pictured is an illustration of various probes that have visited the near side of the moon			2
the dark side remains largely a mystery to the world 's space agencies			0

plans are outlined in an eight minute video , titled ' destination : @entity202 '
@entity4 want humans and probes to visit rim of @entity27 basin
while parts of the basin are shrouded in perpetual darkness , its rim features huge mountainous peaks that are bathed in constant sunlight
this could *provide* continuous solar power to colonies and probes
@entity4 is also hoping to find stores of water that could generate fuel
