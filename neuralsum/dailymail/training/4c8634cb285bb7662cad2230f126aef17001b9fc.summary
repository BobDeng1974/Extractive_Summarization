as the broken swastika - adorned aircraft lies beaten on a hill , crowds of @entity8 villagers from @entity9 , in @entity10 , gather to inspect the wreckage			1
the @entity15 was forced to crash land in @entity8 following a tense dog fight in the skies - and was later dubbed the ' @entity19 '			2
historic : the @entity15 pictured was the first plane to be shot down over @entity4 soil in the second @entity5 - 75 years ago this week the two surviving @entity3 crew surrendered to a local policeman , who was the first person to reach the scene , becoming prisoners of war			0
