@entity0 climbed up to third place in the @entity2 after exacting sweet revenge on arch - rivals @entity4 for october 's grand - final defeat			1
the @entity0 came out on top 12 - 4 in a brutal , no - holds - barred contest in front of a spellbound capacity 24,054 crowd at the @entity11 which contained just three tries but countless examples of rugby league at its finest			1
defences reigned supreme and both sets of players were out on their feet long before the end of an absorbing @entity23 duel as the ferocious exchanges , on a glue - pot pitch , began to takes its toll			0
@entity0 ' @entity28 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates after he scores his side 's first try			1
it took a try from @entity37 - bound winger @entity36 10 minutes from the end to finally break the champions ' resistance			0
it was a second successive defeat for @entity42 , who began the season under @entity45 with six wins in a row , but there was no shame in this loss			0
@entity51 was forced to turn to a new half - back pairing in @entity53 and @entity54 after skipper @entity55 joined @entity56 on the injury list by pulling a hamstring in training while @entity60 , restored to the captaincy , limped off four minutes into the second half to prompt another re-shuffle , @entity0 could hardly have made a better start , with winger @entity28 charging over for a try after just 52 seconds , reclaiming possession after @entity53 's attempted clearance kick was charged down by prop @entity68			1
@entity0 ' @entity28 went over for the first try as his side exacted revenge over @entity4 @entity72 kicked the goal to make it 6 - 0 and @entity42 had to scramble to prevent @entity28 and his centre @entity76 adding to the @entity0 ' lead			1
@entity0 were indebted to a terrific last - ditch by @entity80 that brought down centre @entity81 in full flight and , as the momentum shifted towards the visitors , it was no surprise when impressive forward @entity87 charged over for a try on 15 minutes			2
@entity89 , third choice marskman in the absence of @entity91 and @entity56 , was unable to add the goal and @entity42 suffered a blow when boom second rower @entity95 , just back from an elbow injury , limped off with an ankle problem			0
as the conditions deteriorated and fatigue set in , the game developed into a war of attrition in the second half with chances few and far between			0
@entity0 ' @entity28 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity4 ' @entity81 ( left ) and @entity106 the impressive @entity28 was hauled down just short of the line while @entity42 loose forward @entity108 went close for the visitors			1
the key moment came 10 minutes from the end when @entity42 turned the ball over 20 metres out from their own line after being penned back by @entity0 's tigerish tackling			2
@entity0 substitute prop @entity115 was held up on the line in the next set but the breakthrough came moments later when @entity36 won the race to @entity80 ' grubber kick , touching the ball down with inches to spare			2
@entity123 kicked the conversion to put his side two scores in front and that completed the scoring in a pulsating encounter .			0
