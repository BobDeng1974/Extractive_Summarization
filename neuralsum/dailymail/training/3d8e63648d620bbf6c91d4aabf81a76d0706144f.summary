over the past four years @entity0 has changed job , moved house , had a son , made over 1,000 salads - and had his first book published			1
he is the salad man , and he 's determined to sex up its image			1
' it upsets me that people overlook salads ; they see them as an unsexy side dish when they can be a fantastic meal in their own right , ' says @entity0			1
they can be varied and creative			1
they can be light or heavy , hot or cold			1
it 's a broad spectrum that i never get bored with			1
' salad love : @entity0 is determined to get the nation hooked on green stuff again @entity0 , 40 , a graphic designer , has had no cookery training and had never even considered himself to be a foodie until he moved to @entity26 from his native @entity27 in @entity28 seven years ago			1
with a busy job as head of design at the @entity32 , he depended on takeaways and ready meals at his desk for his lunches			2
but then he put on nearly 2st and began to feel tired and lethargic			2
meanwhile , two close friends were diagnosed with cancer and @entity0 started to worry about his own health			1
' i 've never thought of myself as a foodie , i just knew i liked food like any @entity43 , ' he says			2
' in @entity28 people do n't think about food and what is healthy because it 's all there anyway , ' he says			2
' there are n't really any ready meals and most meals have fresh vegetables			2
but living in @entity51 helped me make the connection between food and health			2
my mother died of breast cancer a few years ago and when friends my age started to get really ill it made me think about the food i was eating			1
' @entity0 says that salads add a plethora of exciting combination options he began to make his own meals for work			1
' initially i did n't call them salads , i just wanted to eat healthily			1
but then i realised that 's what they were			2
' then he started to take salad seriously , doing a big shop on a monday and taking over the office fridge			2
in his drawer was a chopping board , knife , peeler and a variety of spices and seeds , while on the window near his desk he started to grow a selection of herbs			2
he also wanted to be creative ; no boring salads for him			1
' i knew a lot of people who ate the same salads all the time - i wanted to break away from that and create something colourful and incredible			1
' not surprisingly he started to get attention from his colleagues			0
' people in the office would stop and watch what i was doing			0
they definitely thought i was a bit eccentric , but i think they admired the way i did it every day			0
some would say , " what the hell is that ? " and tell me to come down to the pub with them , but others would say , " that looks amazing ! " i 'm a keen photographer so i started taking pictures just before i ate the salad , and that 's when i decided to set myself a challenge and do a blog			0
' that was four years ago , and his challenge was ' 365 days of salads ' in which he would make a salad every lunchtime in the office			1
his blog attracted attention from salad lovers , and though he finished the challenge - and lost that 2st - he still makes a salad every day			0
' if it looks mouthwatering you 've got them			0
even if it is " only " a salad			0
' the blog now has more than 40,000 daily viewers and has been turned into a book , @entity132 , which is being serialised in @entity133 over the next three weeks			1
the book features his favourite 260 salads from the blog , and the photos are the ones he took shortly before he started munching away			1
' my aim is to create the perfect salad			0
the @entity144 believe it takes eight years to master something , so maybe i 'll have to do this for another four years , ' he laughs			1
he 's had a few disasters			0
' once i mixed black beans and beetroot and it was dreadful , ' he says			0
' and i tried adding chocolate - i wo n't be doing that again			0
' but trial and error have helped him fine - tune what he likes in a salad ; not too many ingredients so that you can taste each one , plus plenty of vegetables , one or two types of protein , herbs and a dressing			0
his favourite in the book is a mixture of brown rice , black beans , tomato , avocado and chilli			1
' it blew my mind in a way that i did n't expect , ' he laughs			0
he tries to avoid buying veggies out of season , and compensates for the winter cold by adding hot couscous , rice or quinoa , and warming spices like ginger and chilli			0
he lives in east @entity26 with his wife @entity188 and three - year - old son @entity189 , and recently left his job at @entity191 to work as a freelance designer while hoping his book will open further doors			1
' a lot of people ask me on my blog when i 'm going to open a restaurant and that 's something i 'd think about , ' he says			0
' everything that 's happened is amazing - i do n't know what the future holds but i want to continue developing my knowledge of food and writing about it			0
' while he never had a mission in mind , he likes the idea of inspiring people to eat more healthily			0
' i realised that if you want to appeal to everyone , then it should be through the beauty of it , ' he says			0
' if it looks mouthwatering you 've got them			0
even if it is " only " a salad			0
