whether tearing off his gillet or kicking water bottles in a rage , spoiling for a fight or trading salutes with @entity6 , the most vivid memories of @entity9 's five - month reign at @entity10 do him few favours			1
he seemed too wound - up for a long life on the touchline , destined for self - combustion had @entity16 not intervened as he does to press eject			0
but perhaps the biggest mistake @entity9 made at @entity10 was to allow this theatre to disguise his real intent			1
following @entity22 's resignation , @entity9 has emerged as the front - runner for the @entity25 job 67 - year - old @entity22 has left @entity25 , citing forthcoming knee surgery as the reason behind his decision he is passionate , committed and ambitious			1
he is forthright with his opinions and he demands the same in return from those who surround him			0
it gets him into trouble and will continue to do so , because he is unlikely to change on this front			0
if there is one lesson from his time at @entity40 , one thing that might change , he may be more controlled on the touchline his emotional bond is not so deep at @entity25 and he will feel more relaxed , less anxious to prove his value since he will have the unconditional backing from above , with @entity46 in the role of director of football			2
they know each other well and share an outlook on the game : a vital starting point in such a relationship			0
at @entity40 , @entity9 's antics were exaggerated by the pressure of a ticking clock			1
he wanted to make an impression on the players and the board and on those looking on like fans , media and prospective employers			0
@entity9 worked with @entity25 director of football @entity46 ( left ) while the pair were at @entity10 together there was one notable clash in the technical area with @entity71 as @entity72 won 3 - 1 at @entity40 in the first leg of a @entity75 tie			1
@entity71 became annoyed by @entity9 's hyper - activity and there were tetchy words exchanged before the @entity72 boss marked his team 's third goal by raising three fingers and waving bye - bye to his opposite number			1
@entity9 exiled himself to the stands for the second leg to avoid becoming a side - show			1
he had always been outspoken , with a sharp tongue and a quick put - down			0
he branded @entity91 coach @entity90 ' patronising ' and had a pop at @entity93 , so there was no surprise to see him leave @entity25 with @entity22 on tuesday			1
@entity9 laid into his own players in private and public in a bid to shake them from their comfort zones			2
he accused them of lacking guts and not caring			0
he was not convinced of their commitment and warned they were playing for their futures			0
the view seems to have been shared by his successor @entity109 , given the new man has frozen out plenty of well - paid ' stars ' and launched a concerted bid to get rid of as many as possible in january			0
@entity9 was able to get the best out of maverick players such as @entity6 while at @entity10 unusually for a @entity117 manager , @entity9 was also prepared to publicly criticise his own board for their lack of support			1
' the silence is deafening , is n't it ? ' he said , when asked about his future following a heavy defeat at @entity91			0
he later compared his role to that of a ' supply teacher ' as he wondered aloud why it was difficult to impose his authority on players who enjoyed far greater job security than he did			2
@entity9 won his argument for 18 - month contract when he replaced @entity134 , but it did not keep him in the job any longer			1
his straight - talking style is rooted in his confidence and faith in his own football philosophy			1
@entity9 is intrinsically ' @entity140 ' in that he believes in @entity142 players and coaches			2
he refuses to accept they are simply inferior to those produced abroad but that they are simply not given the same care and attention			0
his contribution to @entity10 's very healthy @entity150 was greatly admired and he learned to trust young players in his original role at the head of their development system as technical coordinator			1
behind the fury of the flying - water bottles and @entity159 costume changes was his patient work with @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
long after @entity9 has left the club , @entity10 are enjoying the rewards			1
@entity9 's patient work with academy players like @entity164 have benefited @entity10 long after his departure striker @entity162 has scored 20 goals in 33 games in all competitions for @entity10 so far this season together with @entity46 and @entity174 , he will provide joined up thinking about how young talent from the @entity150 is nurtured through the ranks and into the first team , and how that dovetails with the club 's transfer policy which clearly requires serious attention			1
this ought to be good for @entity25 , a club which has to learn to live within its means and make more from its local talent , as they did in @entity46 's playing days			2
at the same time , of course , he has to keep them up			0
can he inspire the squad left by @entity22 to better things ? can he find a balanced from an imbalanced squad ? can he cajole something special from the enigmatic @entity192 as he did from @entity6 ? this is the great unknown with @entity9			1
he is a deep football thinker , confident and passionate			0
he has success in youth football but can he translate it ? does he have the tactical ability to operate in the @entity117 , where the standards are so high ? after 23 games @entity25 are 19th in the @entity117 table with 19 points and facing a tough relegation battle the @entity25 ' 3 - 1 loss to @entity204 was the club 's 11th consecutive away defeat in the @entity117 he has yet to complete his @entity208 , the elite coaching qualification , but he is midway through the course with the @entity211 of @entity212 , and this will satisfy the mandatory requirements of @entity117 , who let him through a loophole last season			1
his experience in the field amounts to 28 games at @entity10			2
he won 14 and lost 10			0
his teams played with adventure and risk ; they scored goals and entertained but they leaked plenty too , especially against the best teams , and some tittered when he frowned at the emerging role of the defensive midfielder			0
some claimed that once the initial impact of a different voice had faded at @entity10 that he had little else to offer , but there is more to @entity234			2
he is ruthless and energetic and he is not short on ideas or ambition			0
this is what @entity25 can bank on			2
passionate and committed , @entity234 's high maintenance approach could be the tonic to @entity25 's woes			2

@entity9 is the front - runner to replace @entity22 at @entity25
@entity9 's last job was a five - month reign at @entity10
at @entity10 , he developed a no - *nonsense* and straight talking style
but this should not *detract* from his ambitions or *achievements*
he has a proven record of developing young players
@entity25 are currently 19th in the @entity117 table
