by @entity0 - parkinson last updated at 11:51 am on 11th july 2011 @entity1 is monitoring a piece of ' @entity4 ' space junk that looks likely to come dangerously close to the @entity5 during a planned space walk tomorrow			1
the debris is heading towards the station , where @entity9 yesterday docked on its final mission			2
scientists are still trying to work out how big the object is and how close it will come to @entity9			2
some believe it originated from a defunct @entity4 satellite that is orbiting @entity16			1
@entity17 , mission management team leader , said he hopes the space junk will keep a safe distance and as they observe its trajectory throughout today , they will be able to work out how close it will come			1
in danger ? @entity9 docked at the @entity5 yesterday , just hours before @entity1 scientists warned a piece of space junk is heading its way a space walk is scheduled to take place on tuesday afternoon , but this could now be threatened by the debris window on the world : @entity9 crew member @entity35 looks up at @entity16 @entity9 seen here during a ' back flip ' will engage its thrusters if the space junk gets too close if it appears that the space junk is getting too close for comfort , the astronauts will be able to use thrusters to move @entity9 out of its way			1
two weeks ago , the crew of the @entity5 had to shelter in the lifeboats after a piece of debris missed them by just over 1,000ft - the closest call to date			0
since the first object , @entity52 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			2
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
it is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity16 's orbit			1
yesterday @entity9 landed at the @entity5 for the last time , two days after it became the final @entity1 shuttle to blast into space			1
writing the final chapter in a 30 - year story of triumphs and tragedy , the last shuttle docked successfully after the astronauts on board spent most of their first full day in orbit checking the space shuttle for any damage from friday 's launch			2
@entity9 will now proceed with its mission to deliver more than four tons of supplies - enough for a year - and spare parts to the @entity5 as well as clearing rubbish and picking up a broken pump to transport back to @entity16 for inspection			0
as the shuttle made its final docking on the space station astronaut @entity86 said : ' @entity9 arriving			1
welcome to the @entity5 for the last time			0
' flight deck : @entity91 and @entity92 take their seats at the commander 's and pilot 's stations a small bit of earth can be seen through the window above commander @entity91 , right , and mission specialist @entity102 right before docking , the shuttle also performed a mandated ' back - flip ' in space for the station crew to shoot images of the @entity109 for more analysis			1
the mission will also fly the @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , an experiment designed to demonstrate and test the tools , technologies and techniques needed to robotically refuel satellites in space - even satellites not designed to be serviced			0
to check the shield yesterday , they used the shuttle 's robot arm and an extension to slowly examine the most vulnerable parts of the shuttle 's outer edges , a safety check that has become the norm since 2003 , when the space shuttle @entity131 was destroyed when it returned to @entity16 because of damage during lift off			0
on saturday , the astronauts were woken up at 3.59am by @entity140 's @entity135 - dedicated to pilot @entity92 - as well as a mass greeting from the many employees of @entity1 's @entity138 in @entity139			2
' good morning , @entity9 , ' the workers said in a message recorded before launch			0
' the @entity138 hopes you enjoyed your ride to orbit			0
we wish you a successful mission and a safe return home			0
' mission control is monitoring space junk to make sure it does n't get too close during a space walk with earth in the back ground , @entity9 starts its backflip rotation to expose the heat shield @entity159 flip , @entity9 has to carry out the flip so that astronauts can check all is well with the craft high resolution photographs of @entity9 's heat shield will be thoroughly checked for problems @entity9 is on its final mission to the @entity5 and @entity1 's last craft to go into orbit an artist 's impression of space junk orbiting @entity16			1
@entity172 has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			0

@entity1 is trying to work out if the junk comes from a defunct @entity4 satellite
it is scheduled to pass the space station at around *5pm* *gmt* on tuesday
