by @entity0 published : 04:19 est , 18 june 2012 updated : 09:25 est , 18 june 2012 a couple were left fuming after their trim - looking five - year - old was branded overweight by school health officials - and they insist she wo n't be going on a diet			1
@entity7 and @entity8 were amazed to be told their daughter @entity9 was too heavy after she was weighed as part of national child health checks			2
they said she was on the go ' non-stop ' and was so small she wore clothes made for younger children			1
trim : little @entity17 , who is five , has been branded overweight by school health officials despite weighing just 3st 3lbs			1
her parents say she is ' on - the - go ' non stop and wears clothes made for younger children ' i was hopping mad when i read the letter , ' said mrs @entity17			1
' my friends were appalled a letter like this could be sent out			0
' the couple have called the verdict a ' joke ' and challenged anyone looking at pictures of their daughter to say she looked unhealthy			0
mr @entity8 , a house husband , added : ' there ’s no way @entity9 is overweight			1
she ’s very active and is on the go non-stop with her trampolining , running around and swimming			0
' she will be six in november but still wears clothes for four to five - year - olds			1
' the couple also vowed not to put their daughter , a reception pupil at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , on a diet for fear of sparking eating disorders in later life			1
advice : a copy of the letter the school sent @entity9 's parents telling them she is ' in the overweight range ' and explaining that there are ' small changes ' they could make to help her eat well and be more active @entity60 , which weighed @entity9 as part of the @entity62 , would not comment on her case but insisted the initiative was a useful tool in fighting @entity67 ’s rising weight problem			1
this is n't the first time parents of children who appear to be a healthy weight have been told their little ones are too fat			1
in april , the parents of @entity73 , the smallest in her class , were warned of the ' serious implications ' of her weight in a stern letter from @entity81 bosses			2
the four - year - old , from @entity83 , @entity84 , weighs just 3st 7lb			1
in the same month , the same thing happened to four - year - old @entity87 , from @entity88 , @entity89 , who was declared ' obese ' despite weighing just 2st 13lbs			2
upset : the couple vowed not to put their daughter , a reception pupil at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , ( pictured ) on a diet for fear of sparking eating disorders in later life the latest row began when mr @entity8 , 34 , and mrs @entity17 , 31 , were sent a letter saying @entity9 was 3ft 5ins tall and weighed 3st 3lbs			1
according to the @entity102 - the chart used to assess a child ’s weight and growth pattern - she had a score of 91 , putting her in the overweight category for her age and height			1
the letter went on to offer the couple a list of healthy eating and exercise schemes they could enrol her on			2
the couple said @entity9 had a healthy diet of porridge for breakfast , fruit mid-morning and then at school she had a cooked meal of meat and two vegetables			1
' she is n’t interested in pizza or junk food and prefers brown bread to white , hardly ever has sweets or cakes and when we had a barbecue recently only ate half a burger , ' mr @entity8 said			0
the @entity62 was set up in 2005 and brackets reception class and year 6 pupils according to whether they are underweight , healthy , overweight or obese			0
latest figures , released last december for the 2010/11 school year , showed a rising trend of obese year 6 pupils - those aged ten or 11			2
a total of 19 per cent of year 6 children were classed as obese , up from 18.7 per cent in 2009/10 and 17.5 per cent in 2006/7			0
but the proportion of reception children who were obese in 2010/11 fell to 9.4 per cent ; against 9.8 per cent in 2009/10 and 9.9 per cent in 2006/07			0
mrs @entity17 said : ' there ’s no way i ’m putting @entity9 on a diet			1
that will make her grow up with an eating disorder and turn her anorexic			0
' a health trust spokesman said every child was weighed and measured in their reception class and again in year 6			0
' today , one in three children aged between two and ten is overweight , ' he said			2
' the gradual increase in the number of children who are overweight means society has collectively become used to it			2
so it can be difficult to tell whether an individual child is clinically overweight as they may look similar to other children of their age			0
' research shows that if a child is overweight now , they are more likely to grow up to be overweight as an adult , which can lead to health problems in later life			0
' so the measurements are an important way of checking how a child is growing at crucial stages of their development			0
' @entity179 chief executive @entity178 said : ' more than a million children in @entity181 are measured as part of the @entity62			0
' it shows that , while the proportion of four - to - five year olds who are obese has fallen , the opposite has happened among ten and 11 - year - olds			0

parents say she 's always on - the - go and wears clothes for younger children
couple say she wo n't be going on a diet in case it sparks eating disorders
@entity9 is 3ft 5ins and weighs 3st 3lbs and has an ' overweight ' @entity202 score
@entity60 say weighing children helps fight nation 's rising weight problem
