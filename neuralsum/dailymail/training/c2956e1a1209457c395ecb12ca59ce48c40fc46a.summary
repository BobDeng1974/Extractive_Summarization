@entity1 manager @entity0 is to investigate the spate of muscle injuries that threatens to undermine his side 's return to form			1
@entity1 could have to play through the @entity8 programme without a recognised senior striker and their captain after a costly 1 - 0 victory over @entity13 bottom side @entity12 on saturday			1
the club 's only fit striker , @entity14 , suffered a calf muscle injury in the warm - up before skipper @entity18 pulled up with a recurrence of a hamstring problem late in the second half			1
@entity18 ( centre ) was substituted late in @entity1 's game against @entity12 on saturday @entity14 ( top right ) sustained a calf injury in the warm - up before @entity1 's game against @entity12 both are unlikely to be fit before new year and join forwards @entity29 and @entity31 on the casualty list			1
their absences will leave sizeable gaps at both ends of the field and @entity0 wants to find out if there is an underlying cause , although the @entity39 will not make excuses			1
' maybe we must find a reason why , ' said @entity0 , whose side have won seven in succession			1
' it is very unlucky to have the three strikers out with injuries but we must try to solve the problem and play another way , or keep a clean sheet			2
' it is difficult because we have to play a lot of games during the last days of december , but i never complain about the players who can not play			0
' @entity18 had been making his comeback after a three - game absence with a hamstring injury and the influential @entity60 also missed a game at @entity62 in november with a calf problem			1
@entity14 had only recently returned from a four - game lay - off with a calf strain while @entity31 has had niggly hamstring issues in recent weeks and aggravated them in wednesday 's @entity68 win at @entity69			1
@entity29 ( centre ) has been in superb form for @entity1 this season but is out injured for around six weeks fellow striker @entity31 ( right ) has aggravated a hamstring problem and also faces time out injured city manager @entity0 ( centre ) has vowed to look into the number of muscle injuries his side have had full - back @entity78 missed all @entity1 's november fixtures with a calf injury			1
top scorer @entity29 has knee ligament damage and could be out for up to eight weeks			2
teenage striker @entity83 was drafted into the side at the @entity85 at the last moment and the lack of current alternatives could force @entity1 into the transfer market in january			0
@entity0 said : ' in january we will see , it is an option			2
i think our squad must always be strong			0
' another looming problem is the loss of midfielder @entity96 to the @entity97 next month			0
that is likely to mean @entity0 will press harder to extend the loan of @entity100 in the coming days			2
former @entity101 and @entity102 midfielder @entity100 again proved @entity1 's chief inspiration and was their match - winner at @entity12 , netting the only goal - his sixth for the club - five minutes before half - time			1
@entity0 wants @entity100 ( centre ) to stay at the club for longer than his current loan spell states the 36 - year - old 's loan from sister club @entity112 expires at the end of the month and @entity0 has made clear he wants him to stay longer			1
he also said after the game that @entity100 himself also wanted to stay on			0
a decision has not yet been made but @entity0 had already come to a firm opinion on his value before the injuries to strikers that left the veteran as one of the team 's few obvious goalscorers			1
' that is why he is now on the team but he would not stay with us because we have injured strikers , ' said @entity0			2
' he would stay with us because he is a very important player			0
' @entity1 were laboured but at least kept claimed the three points needed to prevent @entity102 extending their three - point advantage at the top of the table			2
@entity12 made the early running and rallied late on but @entity1 's defence held firm and recorded a valuable third clean sheet in the space of a week			1
' as a defender it is always nice to have a clean sheet but i want to say all the team defended well , ' said right - back @entity143			2
' we faced a very athletic team			0
they tried to create problems but we stayed compact as a team and finally we got the three points			0
we have to look forward and keep working			0
' @entity143 ( middle ) was happy with how his team defended against @entity12 during their 1 - 0 win @entity154 ( left ) watches on as his side slipped to another defeat , this time at home to @entity1 @entity12 boss @entity154 feels his side are letting themselves down at both ends of the field			1
the result left the promoted @entity162 bottom of the table and without a win in 11 games , since they stunned @entity167 on september 21			0
he said : ' this remains the frustrating aspect about our season so far - that we are not converting key chances and an inability to keep that clean sheet			0
' we find ourselves adrift at the bottom at the moment and that is something we are going to have to rectify			0
' from a tactical perspective we did n't really allow them to have a great deal of dominance			0
' but the bottom line is , it is about being dominant in both boxes and we have not delivered that again			0
