@entity0 vs @entity1 will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century			1
evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political , social and cultural undertones , the scale of expectation and outside influences			0
where @entity13 vs @entity1 comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the @entity18			1
here is the second of my 12 most significant fights in boxing ’s history			1
the fight against the nazis @entity27 , @entity28 june 22 , 1938 @entity29 vs @entity30 @entity29 ( left ) knocks out @entity30 in the first round to win the heavyweight title on june 22 , 1938 although @entity34 was trumpeting @entity30 as a hero of the @entity36 following his knock - out victory over @entity29 two years earlier , the @entity33 was anti-nazi and remained so during @entity38 which was imminent at the time of the re-match			1
@entity29 had come back from that shock to win the world heavyweight title by defeating @entity43 but announced he would not consider himself the true champion until he avenged the loss to @entity30			1
the fight was billed as a political war between an @entity48 struggling to emerge from the @entity49 and a @entity33 provoking armed conflict in @entity51 by annexing @entity52			0
yet such was @entity30 ’s distaste for being exploited by @entity34 ’s propaganda machine – and his loyal refusal to sack his @entity57 manager – that his wife and mother were refused permission to travel to @entity28 to support him in case he defected to the @entity48 the social picture was clouded further by black @entity48 ’s belief in @entity29 as a high - profile campaigner for @entity65			1
louis is carried by his supporters ahead of his 1938 re-match with @entity30 a poster for the rematch ( left ) while @entity29 and @entity30 shake hands at the weigh - in ahead of their fight @entity74 vs @entity75 @entity29 , who had complacently trained on the links rather in the gym for the first fight , gave up golf and women in serious preparation for the return bout			1
president @entity83 invited @entity29 to the @entity84 and told him : ' @entity29 , we need muscles like yours to beat the @entity33			2
’ @entity29 would say : ‘ the whole damned country was depending on me			2
’ @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 were among @entity94 celebrities in the 70,000 crowd , along with @entity97 boss @entity96			0
louis is pictured jumping aside as @entity30 falls after the knock - out @entity29 had been tactically out - thought in their first fight so decided to go for broke from the first bell			1
a barrage of left hooks followed by a right to the body had @entity30 doubled - up in pain and referee @entity107 gave him a standing eight count			0
@entity29 switched his attack to the head , dropping @entity30 twice , and @entity107 called a halt only two minutes and 40 seconds into the fight			1
@entity29 , the @entity29 , had fractured @entity30 ’s spine with his body attacks			2
as the man from @entity117 was taken to hospital the ambulance passed through @entity119 and he recalled later : ‘ i could the noise of crowds dancing			0
@entity122 had left the bars and were playing on the sidewalks			0
everywhere was filled with celebrations and saxophones			0
’ louis goes on the attack against @entity30 as he gains revenge after defeat two years earlier @entity30 would be forcibly conscripted as a @entity33 paratrooper war but served only briefly and his resistance to @entity34 made him a hero in his country for a second time , after the war			0
he invested in successful businesses and lived until shortly before his 100th birthday , in 2005			0
@entity29 lost his money and became a greeter at @entity142 in @entity143			0
his old friend @entity30 visited him there once every year until his death in 1981 , when he acted as a pall - bearer at @entity29 ’ funeral .			2
