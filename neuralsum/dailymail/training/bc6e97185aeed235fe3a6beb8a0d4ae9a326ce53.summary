@entity0 launched a trial balloon attack on presumed @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 on wednesday evening at the launch of his political action committee , taking aim at her foreign policy credentials and economic message			1
the @entity10 businessman currently exploring a presidential bid suggested former secretary of state @entity12 should be held responsible for the foreign policy blunders of the @entity16 administration , according to an attendee of the @entity19 , @entity20 , event			1
speaking more generally , @entity0 said , ‘ if someone wants to run a campaign about 90s nostalgia , it ’s not going to be very successful , ’ the source told a reporter for @entity27			1
@entity12 has not announced her candidacy for president yet but she is already the @entity3 frontrunner @entity12 's husband , @entity46 , held the title of president during the last seven years of the ' 90s , and the era is often associated in the @entity50 with economic prosperity			1
in her previous presidential campaign , the former first lady sought to tap into her husband 's popularity and wield it to her advantage , telling voters , ' i ’ve apprenticed , and i ’ve learned how to do it			2
i have watched it being done for eight years … it took a @entity12 to clean up after the first @entity0 , and it ’ll take a @entity12 to clean up after the second @entity0			2
' while longing for years gone by was n't enough to propel @entity12 to victory over @entity16 in the 2007 @entity3 primary , her association with the ' @entity66 ' did resonate voters			1
' during the @entity12 administration , we were thriving , ' one @entity71 resident told a reporter for @entity75 at the time			2
' we had a home , two cars and my husband had a good job			0
after the @entity10 came in , we lost the house and one of the cars			0
it was like we lost everything			0
' this time around @entity12 has kept her political speeches in close alignment with economic initiatives favored by the @entity16 administration and progressive groups such as equal pay for equal work and paid family leave			1
but in a face - off against @entity0 , whose father lost the presidency to @entity12 after only one term and brother exited the @entity100 amid a sky - high unemployment rate , ' 90s comparisons would likely resurface in @entity12 's stump speeches			1
that 's if either @entity0 or @entity12 competes for the @entity100 at all			1
neither have officially declared their candidacies , although both are expected to early in the year			0
@entity0 is pictured here in @entity109 , @entity110 , earlier this month with his son @entity111 at @entity111 's swearing in ceremony as @entity114			2
to @entity0 's left is his wife , @entity116 , and at the far right is @entity111 's wife @entity117			0
@entity0 has not officially announced his candidacy for the @entity10 nominiation for president but he is ' actively exploring ' a bid in preparation for a possible head - to - head challenge with @entity12 , @entity0 is already readying attacks on the frontrunner for the @entity3 nomination			1
ahead of the midterm elections , @entity0 went after @entity12 over her argument that corporations and businesses do n't create jobs			1
@entity12 's camp swiftly clarified that she meant to say ' our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good - paying jobs , ' but the damage was already done			0
@entity0 used the verbal gaffe to highlight his own business acumen			0
' well , the problem in @entity50 today is that not enough jobs are being created			0
they are created by businesses where people ’s income rise where they can live a life of purpose and meaning independent of government , ' he told a group of @entity10 at a @entity155 rally			2
' that should be the mission , ' he continued			0
' and the only way that we do that is to create a climate of high sustained economic growth where everybody , everybody in this country has a chance at earned success			0
' after serving two terms as governor of @entity29 , @entity0 joined the business world , taking seats on a handful of boards , including @entity175 bank and @entity176			2
as of last week he had resigned those positions to focus on his presidential campaign			0
within hours of his announcement that he would ' actively explore ' the presidency , the @entity179 was already imploring its supporters to ' think about how president @entity0 worked out last time ' and comparing @entity0 to his brother @entity111 , who held the position for eight years directly after @entity12			1
at the fundraiser on wednesday evening for his @entity186 to rise leadership @entity36 , @entity0 also reportedly tested out a response to naysayers who do n't want a repeat of either @entity0 presidencies			1
' do you have a father ? do you have a brother ? are you the same person ? ’ he said , according to the the insider who talked to @entity27 .			0

‘ if someone wants to run a campaign about 90s nostalgia , it ’s not going to be very successful , ’ @entity0 is said to have told a group of his supporters
the @entity10 businessman also suggested @entity12 be held responsible for the @entity16 administration 's foreign policy blunders
he also tested out a response to naysayers who do n't want a repeat of the presidencies of either his father , @entity213 , or his brother , @entity215
@entity0 is the former governor of @entity29 , and he is currently exploring a presidential bid , though he has not formally announced his candidacy
@entity2 has n't officially jumped in the 2016 race yet , but she is expected in the next couple months
