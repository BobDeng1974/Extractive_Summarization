a feeble display from @entity2 's side saw them sink to a 3 - 1 defeat at home to @entity6 in the last 16 of the @entity7			1
@entity8 put @entity6 ahead after 38 minutes and former @entity10 striker @entity9 doubled the lead eight minutes into the second half			1
@entity12 pulled one back as the game went into stoppage time , but @entity15 added a third for @entity6 in the final seconds			1
@entity18 's @entity17 rates every player 's performance at the @entity21			2
former @entity10 striker @entity9 ( second left ) lashes past @entity22 for @entity6 's second goal @entity24 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity22 7 saved @entity24 on 61 minutes with smart reaction to @entity26 ; could n't do much for the deflected goal			1
@entity28 4 lost ball for second goal			2
troubled by @entity26 all night and poor delivery going forward			0
@entity28 ( left ) of @entity24 tries to deliver a cross as @entity6 's @entity26 ( right ) tries to close down @entity24 defender and captain @entity33 was not his usual authoritative self for his team on wednesday per mertesacker 4 meant to be the leader of the defence so has to take responsibility for the shocking display			1
unlucky deflection for first goal ? maybe , but it was an ungainly attempt at a block			2
@entity45 4.5 just as culpable			0
where was he and what was he thinking for @entity6 's second and third ? @entity49 4.5 had done better than his colleagues - until he was caught out for the third goal			1
@entity52 4.5 afforded @entity6 far too much space and did n't provide defensive shield - that 's his primary purpose			1
@entity56 's performance was not as purposeful as his previous impressive displays @entity58 ( centre ) lifted a good chance over the bar in the early exchanges of @entity24 against @entity6 @entity56 5.5 not enough pace or purpose in the passing			1
great free kick for @entity67 but uncomfortable and unaccomplished in defensive duties @entity58 5 has to do better for the first goal ; did n't do enough thereafter			2
@entity70 4 it was for nights like this that @entity24 paid Â£ 42m			2
and it is on nights like these he continues to disappoint @entity77 6 the best of a bad bunch			0
not good , just better than the rest			0
@entity67 missed a number of superb chances for @entity24 on a night to forget for the @entity84 international @entity67 3.5 what to say ? the header he missed on 52 minutes was bad enough ; the open goal just awful			1
subs : @entity90 ( @entity67 60 ) 6 did his utmost but damage had been done			0
@entity12 7 ( @entity93 68 ) great finish which should have given @entity24 hope			1
@entity12 ( left ) scored a goal which could have given @entity24 a route back into the tie @entity99 6 ( @entity56 82 ) no blame attached			1
introduced too late to have an impact			0
manager : @entity2 4 when a team defends this badly this often , the coach has to take the blame			0
@entity6 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity107 7 solid throughout and a good foundation for the win			2
@entity111 8 just superb for a raw youngster - crucial part in first goal			2
@entity115 8.5 his goal - line clearance from @entity58 was just one moment in an outstanding night			0
@entity6 's central defender @entity115 ( right ) was outstanding in the heart of his side 's back line @entity122 8 stand - in defender and he was accomplished and solid			1
@entity124 7.5 excellent at left back , probing going forward			0
@entity125 7.5 playing out of position he provided the hard running and dirty defensive work for the midfield			0
@entity26 8 @entity131 run and pace to set up the second goal - troubled @entity28 all night long			0
@entity26 ( right ) helped @entity6 defensively and also contributed to his side 's second goal @entity8 8.5 with @entity138 , outstanding , just the kind of player @entity24 need in midfield			1
only marked down for turning his back on the @entity144 - @entity143 strike @entity138 9 just a complete performance , defensively and going forward			0
his flick on 61 minutes to set up martial ? his volley on 63 minutes ? the best moments of the match			0
@entity151 7 the captain was probing going forward and diligent in protecting his young full back @entity9 8 three @entity24 defenders tried to prevent him getting his shot away - but he was never going to miss. still exquisite at what he does best			1
@entity138 ( second right ) holds off @entity49 in an influential display for @entity6 against @entity24 @entity9 ( second right ) scored @entity6 's second with a composed finish under pressure subs : @entity162 ( @entity9 74 ) 8 great run and finish for the killer third goal			1
@entity167 ( @entity168 82 ) 6 solid and did his job when came on			0
@entity170 ( @entity26 83 ) 6 added defensive steel when he came on for last seven minutes @entity172 ( second right ) celebrates alongside @entity9 ( second left ) after the game at the @entity21 manager : @entity172 9 a perfectly - executed plan , his star continues to rise			2
his exploits here and at @entity179 are noticed			0
ref : @entity180 7 the perfect performance for a ref - non descript			0

@entity24 fell behind to a deflected strike from @entity6 's @entity8
@entity9 doubled the lead in the 53rd minute with a *clinical* finish
