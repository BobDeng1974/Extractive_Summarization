by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:00 pm on 15th july 2011 meteoric rise , and ignominious fall : former chief executive of @entity5 @entity4 as a young reporter , at the beginning of her career , @entity4 was described by her editor as ' the most ambitious person i have ever met '			1
@entity12 , an early friend and colleague , could n’t have forecast it better			1
it took 20 years for the @entity17 - born redhead to rise from researcher on the @entity20 ’s sunday magazine to the head of @entity5 , the @entity22 arm of @entity24 ’s global empire			1
at each stage of her meteoric rise her ability to survive in the cut - throat world of newspapers , dominated by middle - aged male executives , was questioned			1
' it wo n’t last , ' was a favourite comment said behind her back			1
but it was her determination , hard work and total focus on her career that got her noticed , and promoted			1
early critics harped at her lack of a traditional hard - news apprenticeship , she had n’t served her time on local papers			1
but her secret weapon was that most traditional of journalistic tools , the ability to target and foster important contacts			1
and her skill was to remain friendly with them after the stories had run			1
during her first job at @entity5 , as feature writer on the @entity20 ’s sunday magazine , she was sent to interview footballer @entity55 , who had moved to @entity56 to play for @entity57 , and his wife @entity58			1
@entity4 turned up at the airport to travel out with the couple to discover that she was being joined on the trip by a very experienced reporter from a rival newspaper			2
most young journalists would have buckled and come back empty - handed			2
@entity4 unleashed the charm that would shape her career to befriend @entity55 , and more importantly , @entity58			2
she came back with her first splash for the @entity20 and the first of many strong contacts that would help shape her future career			1
@entity71 , the then editor of the @entity20 , was impressed and within days @entity4 was yanked ' upstairs ' to join the paper			1
on her way to the top : @entity20 editor @entity75 ( centre ) was succeeded in 2000 by @entity4 , as she then was			1
the appointment came just days before her 32nd birthday arm in arm with @entity24 , @entity4 leaves @entity81 's restaurant in @entity82 six years ago			2
the @entity84 chairman is the most important person she has charmed in her career			2
in 2009 he appointed her chief executive of @entity5 ' it ’ll never last , ' was muttered around @entity88			2
but times were changing for newspapers , and their staff			2
the market was becoming more competitive and the pressure to be sharper than the rest was growing			2
long liquid lunches were on the way out			2
@entity4 put in the hours , always going the extra yard to give herself an edge in her quest to move up			2
for instance when fellow colleagues moaned that they did n’t have a clue what was going on in tv soaps , as they were never home in time to see them , @entity4 had them taped for her			1
as she waited for the first edition of the paper to print she used her one bit of down time to watch the tapes and catch up on the storylines , making sure she could answer @entity114 ’s quickfire questions he fired at his staff during his editorial conferences as editor of @entity20			1
and so she impressed and moved up through the ranks of the features desk to become features editor and then deputy editor			1
she summed up her early struggles up the newspapers career ladder with this recollection from her 2009 @entity126 lecture to aspiring journalists at the @entity128			2
' when at the age of 27 , i was made deputy editor of the @entity20 , some struggled with the concept			1
' at a corporate event , a senior male executive lost the buttons off his shirt			2
' the editor and i were busy meeting and greeting our high profile guests when suddenly a shirt and some buttons were thrust into my hand			1
" when you ’ve got a minute darling ‘ – sew ‘ em back on for me			2
" ' despite needlework not being my strong point , i did have the shirt ready in time			1
' and we were all sorry to hear what happened to him ! ' he did n’t last			2
the toughest part of working at a red top tabloid , with its constant ' turning over ' of people is keeping hold of your contacts			1
mixing with the highest society : @entity4 and @entity114 meet the @entity162 during a reception for the media at @entity165 in 2002			2
@entity166 is adept at charming contacts and then keeping them leading the high life : @entity166 meets the @entity170 and @entity171 at @entity172 at @entity173 in 2008 but @entity4 had the unique flair for befriending people that were important to her and keeping hold of them			1
she worked hard at making sure celebrities and their agents fell for her charm			2
she was tagged , ' the most charming tabloid operator of all time '			1
she even took golf lessons so as she could network at the @entity5 celebrity golf tournament			0

she was released without charge and went straight from the police station to the morning news conference she was due to chair			0
for once , the usually boisterous room was hushed as the news editor read through his list of news stories getting no reaction from a head - bowed @entity4			1
by chance or design he had left on his list an item about domestic violence			0
@entity4 ’s reaction sums up her abilty to deal with adversity			0
with all eyes on her , she looked up with a smile that said , 's * * t happens '			0
the room erupted with laughter and normal service was restored			0
as her career moved up so did her circle of contacts and friends			1

courting controversy : @entity4 with @entity263 , mother of murdered @entity252			0

when asked what his top priority was , @entity24 gestured at her and said : ' this one '			1
as pressure grew for @entity4 to resign , with even @entity195 calling the action ' truly dreadful ' , he said : ' recent allegations of phone hacking and making payments to police with respect to the @entity20 are deplorable and unacceptable			0
' i have made clear that our company must fully and proactively cooperate with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what @entity5 has been doing and will continue to do under @entity4 ' leadership			0
