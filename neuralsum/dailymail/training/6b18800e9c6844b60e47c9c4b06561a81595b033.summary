by @entity1 reporter published : 05:27 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 11:09 est , 8 september 2012 with its space - age design and ultra-modern , grey exterior , it is hardly a home in keeping with its traditional residential surroundings			1
but despite neighbours ' objections , this unconventional property in @entity12 , @entity10 is nearing completion - and it could be a sign of things to come for homeowners			1
the super-sleek ' alien spaceship ' house belonging to architect @entity20 caused fury from residents this week , just days after the government 's relaxation of planning laws caused similar levels of indignation among @entity28			1
ultra-modern : @entity20 's property in @entity12 , @entity10 , has been likened to a @entity31 due to its space - age appearance unfinished : the sleek home remains surrounded by steel fencing and tarpaulin six years after construction started ministers warned that plans to allow homeowners to build extensions and conservatories of up to almost 30ft without permission will be a recipe for neighbour disputes			1
although the property was built from scratch starting six years ago , mr @entity20 's construction is an example of the kind of outlandish designs which could spring up without objection now @entity51 has relaxed planning laws so homeowners can develop without permission			0
mps and planning experts have warned of a divisive planning ' free - for - all ' now ' permitted development rights ' are set to be relaxed for three years			2
the proposals from communities secretary @entity60 will double the size of extensions that can be built without permission			0
a consultation will be published soon			0
@entity65 , a former labour cabinet minister , said : ‘ i ’m very concerned that we will see an explosion of unsightly and un-neighbourly development			2
' by scrapping planning controls the government will leave many people powerless to maintain a decent quality environment			0
prestigious : mr @entity20 's design won an architectural award last year , earning praise for ' maximising the potential of a narrow infill site ' leafy : four - bedroom houses on @entity81 regularly fetch asking prices of £ 3.5m ' you will have people putting up huge extensions and to hell with the neighbours			1
' i want people to get on and be able to improve their homes , but it has to be done in a neighbourly way			0
' if this goes ahead i have no doubt we will see some very serious neighbour disputes , with no one to arbitrate in the way the planning system does at the moment			0
' families on the desirable @entity81 in @entity12 , @entity10 , say the long - running construction of mr @entity20 's house has left their road a ' mess ' and even forced property prices down			1
the house is in a conservation area surrounded by homes built in the late 18th century , and was designed by architects @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , owned by partner in the firm mr @entity20			2
last year the design won the @entity113 at the @entity115 ’s @entity114 , which described the posh pad as a ‘ four - storey house ( which ) maximises the potential of a narrow infill site ’			1
it adds : ' the traditional relationship of living and sleeping accommodation is inverted with the bedroom and bathrooms at garden level and the living area above to enjoy the south aspect and views over @entity10			2
' the high - level living element ( is ) prefabricated and craned into position			0
' but neighbours have this week slammed the house - saying it makes the prestigious road look a ‘ total and utter mess ’ with its fenced off entrance , scattered traffic cones and blue tarpaulin			1
who are these guys ? @entity141 , nine , looks a little bewildered as @entity51 and @entity142 hold forth during a visit to a housing development in @entity145 , @entity146 they are now demanding to know when the house - which is wedged between two existing homes - will be finished , six years since construction work began			1
owner @entity20 blamed planning laws , which he says delayed the completion of the house			0
he told the @entity155 newspaper this week : ' certainly there has been fierce opposition by a few neighbours			0
' we understand the concerns about the delay to its completion , which has been painfully experienced by us			0
' the house is not conventional and explores various architectural ideas about creating a joyful home appropriate to this age			1
' it is unashamedly modern and we accept that it will not be everybody ’s cup of tea			0
' however , the design won the @entity113 at the @entity173 last year and we consider that to be a cultured endorsement			2

residents in leafy @entity10 *suburb* *claim* development has left their street a ' total mess '
space - age house won architectural design award last year - but neighbours say it looks like a spaceship
