@entity0 has criticised @entity2 ’s advisor , suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at @entity5 if left to make a decision alone			1
with @entity5 losing 4 - 1 at @entity7 on saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the @entity10 next season effectively ending , @entity0 made veiled criticisms of the player ’s agent , @entity12 , after the televised interview @entity2 gave last week , in which he admitted he was flattered by @entity7 ’s interest in him			1
@entity0 also revealed that he has sat down with @entity2 since that tv interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now , even though there may come a time when he does leave			1
@entity2 goes past @entity22 during the @entity24 match at the @entity25 @entity2 has reject a contract extension worth £ 100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season , but @entity0 said : ‘ i ’ve had a good chat with him			1
i have given him my opinion on it			2
this is a young kid who has been advised to do something else			2
a 20 - year - old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the @entity39			2
‘ you do n’t do that ; him in particular			2
he just wants to play his football			2
but of course if he ’s asked to do that by other parties then that ’s what he ’ll do			2
‘ in the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at			0
in fairness to @entity2 , i brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and i know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him			1
’ @entity2 has rejected a contract extension worth £ 100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal ‘ in my time in coaching there are a lot of very , very good agents			1
the only thing i would say on @entity2 ’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially , @entity5 is the best place for him			1
there is absolutely no question of that			0
‘ i think he enjoys being at @entity5 and loves playing for @entity5 and knows he is privileged to play in front of @entity5 supporters			1
as a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer			0
what that will be in five , six , seven years time is different			0
but for this moment of his career and life , he really enjoys it			0
he has said that himself			0
he has talked very openly about loving his football and playing for a great club like @entity5			1
’ @entity2 said he was flattered by @entity7 's interest in signing him should he leave @entity5 this summer @entity2 grapples with @entity7 defender @entity87 during @entity5 's defeat to the @entity89 @entity0 admits that the task may have become more difficult now that @entity5 ’s hunt for a top four spot seems to have come to an end but remains confident that he can persuade the player to extend his deal ‘ as long as the player can see the ambition of the club			1
we all know the reality of where the game is at in this country			0
there are bigger spenders than ourselves and more experienced squads – the model at @entity5 is different			1
‘ of course players will want to look at possibilities when that time comes			0
but when you talk specifically about @entity2 – because he ’s got huge potential but there ’s still a bit to go - then i think @entity5 is the best place for him			1
@entity2 competes with @entity116 during a defeat which all - but ends @entity5 's top four chances ‘ he has had the opportunity to play , which is key for a young player			1
it is the model of @entity5 , which the owners have put in , where they want to create the world class talent			1
he has just turned 20			0
there is still a long way for him to go and he has a lot of potential			0
i believe that will be developed over the next coming years at @entity5			1
‘ it is the job of his advisors to look at the possibilities might be beyond that			2
but he has two and a half years left and wo n’t be going anywhere in the summer – that ’s for sure			0
and we ’ll sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer			0
’ @entity2 is taken to ground by @entity7 's @entity143 defender @entity142 during the game in north @entity145 @entity0 went out of his way to play the player , who missed an easy first half opportunity to put @entity5 ahead but who was their most consistent threat and won them the penalty they scored			1
@entity0 said : ‘ there was no change in him			1
i thought he was excellent today , our best player			2
he was aggressive in his running , pressed the ball well , he won the penalty			0
he was very direct and strong			0
‘ this is a kid that is really focused on his football			0
there ’s no change and he works hard every single day			0
and you see from today , he just wants to play his football			0
the kid for me gives me everything the way he trains and plays			0
