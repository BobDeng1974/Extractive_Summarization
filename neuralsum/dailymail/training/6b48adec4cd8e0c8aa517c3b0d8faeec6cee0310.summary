web sleuths from across the world have joined in the search for the missing @entity3 by turning to the map search website @entity5			1
the online community has added to the confusion surrounding the 12 day mystery of the missing jetliner as people post possible sightings and new theories			2
even celebrities have taken to poring over satellite images uploaded to the website and offering up their suggestions as to where the plane might be			1
investigators meanwhile probing the disappearance of the plane believe it most likely flew into the southern @entity23 , a source close to the investigation said today			1
@entity26 appears to be the most famous user of @entity5 after she posted a photograph of satellite imagery from the site on her @entity32 page on monday , and suggested : ' i 'm no expert but up close this does look like a plane and an oil slick			1
' elsewhere , users of social networking site @entity37 have posted an image which they claim appears to show debris from the plane in the @entity41			1
users of social networking site @entity37 have posted an image which they claim appears to show debris from the plane on the surface of the @entity41 , along with an overlay which shows the scale of the @entity47 ( left ) the area highlighted the same place where crew on a @entity52 - flagged oil tanker on sunday responded to radio reports of suitcases found floating on the surface			1
users of @entity37 have also suggested the scale of the potential debris matches that of the missing aircraft			1
another image to have gained attention appears to show a plane flying over a jungle , discovered by a university student in @entity64 , according to @entity64 's @entity65			1
@entity66 has uploaded high - resolution satellite and aerial images to its @entity5 site that let people explore the seas for clues about the crash , as well signs of a wreckage or oil slick			1
the authenticity of the photo by the @entity64 student , also posted to @entity37 on sunday , has not yet been verified and online commentators have raised questions over the veracity of the image , with some pointing out it appears to be a different model to the missing @entity47 777			1
the plane also appears to have been painted white			2
the image surfaced at the same time as news emerged that @entity90 villagers claim to have seen the missing jet flying over the north east of the country at around the time the aircraft is thought to have made a ' u-turn '			1
@entity26 posted a snapshot of an area of the ocean she believed could contain the remains of the missing flight @entity3 on her @entity32 page on monday @entity66 has uploaded high - resolution satellite and aerial images to its @entity5 site that let people explore the seas for clues about the crash , as well signs of a wreckage or oil slick at least nine people - tuna fishermen , farmers and villagers - in @entity114 in @entity115 have made reports to police about seeing lights in the sky and some said they heard the loud noise of an engine			1
similarly , residents of a tiny island in the @entity125 in the @entity126 say they saw a plane with @entity129 markings in the early hours of saturday march 8			2
@entity132 military officials may be staging a mass cover - up over missing flight @entity3 , because they do not want to expose gaping holes within their countries ' air defences , a leading aviation expert has suggested			2
the @entity129 jet went missing 1.30am on sunday , march 9			0
but it was not until the following tuesday that the @entity90 @entity140 reported they had spotted the aircraft on radar over the @entity41 at 2.15am			0
now @entity144 's military say they detected a plane at 1.28am , eight minutes after @entity3 's communications went down , heading towards the @entity41 but did not share the information because they were not asked for it			2
intensive background checks on everyone aboard had turned up no - one else with a political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the plane			0
writing on his blog , aviation expert @entity153 said : ' maybe these states ’ air defences , like @entity115 ’s , are not what they are cracked up to be			2
and maybe they would n’t want the rest of the world to know that			0
' mr @entity153 , a former pilot and now operations and safety editor at the respected @entity165 publication , points out that @entity3 might have flown over several @entity132 countries including @entity144 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
he said they may be withholding vital radar data about @entity3 for fear it would expose gaping holes in their multi-billion pound air defences			0
one said : ' i 've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before			0
we 've seen seaplanes but i 'm sure this was not one of those			0
' @entity115 's acting transport minister @entity187 however told a daily news conference today that the reports had been investigated by police in the @entity126 and were determined to be untrue			1
investigators earlier told the @entity192 that they were now convinced the aircraft flew low over the village , which is in the north east - exactly the same area where the villagers and fishermen in @entity115 who saw bright lights in the sky and heard noises on the night the jet vanished are living			1
investigators told a @entity90 newspaper that the @entity47 had dropped to a lower altitude - under 5,000ft - to avoid ground radar , using the surrounding terrain as a sonar barrier			2
this type of flying is considered to be dangerous and risky , because it places tremendous pressure on the frame of the aircraft - and flying low at night without radar assistance could lead to the plane crashing into trees or mountains			2
the first report of a ' bright light descending at high speed ' came from mr @entity222 , 29 who said he saw the light heading towards the @entity224 at 1.45am on the night the aircraft disappeared			0
businessman mr @entity222 lives in @entity227 , in the far north west of the @entity90 mainland , close to the southern border of @entity144 - and the light he witnessed would have been several miles to the north of the flight path the jet was on before it vanished			2
lending credibility to the account by mr @entity222 is the claim by fisherman @entity237 , 55 , who saw a bright light streaking overhead at 1.30am on saturday , about 100 miles south of where mr @entity222 had seen the light			0
mr @entity222 told said the bright light was the type that aircraft use when taking off and landing at night - like a car uses its headlights			0
the satellite image from @entity5 , the online map site used by millions in the search for the missing @entity3 , shows a passenger plane over a jungle mystery : the image was found by an university student in @entity64 ' i was walking towards the rear of my house when i saw the light , and wondered where it was heading to , ' he said			1
' the airspace here is like a highway for aircraft and they usually travel in routine patterns			0
' however , the light i saw was moving towards a completely different direction			0
it was going towards the sea , near @entity271 ( which lies to the south of mr @entity222 's home )			0
' his description tends to indicate that if the light he saw was on the doomed aircraft , it had turned north instead of continuing on its regular north - easterly flight path			0
mr @entity222 said the aircraft he usually sees fly across the sky for as far as his eyes could see but the light he saw in the early hours of saturday vanished from view behind a line of coconut trees			0
the @entity288 ( @entity288 ) has expanded their search area for the missing flight into the @entity23 hope : a message of support is displayed at @entity293 while he thought nothing of it at the time , when he learned about the missing aircraft @entity3 the following day he lodged a report with police			1
mr @entity222 's account tended to coincide with that of fisherman mr @entity237 who told the @entity192 : ' usually , lights from an airplane look like distant stars at night but the one that i saw was big , as the aircraft was flying below the clouds			0
' i followed the light for about five minutes before it disappeared			0
' a royal australia @entity140 pilot in an @entity315 maritime patrol aircraft scans the surface of the sea during a search operation for the missing @entity3 to the west of @entity115 investigators probing the disappearance of the plane believe it most likely flew into the southern @entity23 , a source close to the investigation said today			1
an unprecedented search for the @entity327 is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search ' corridors ' , one arcing north overland from @entity333 towards the @entity334 , the other curving south across the @entity23 from west of @entity336 to west of @entity337			1
' the working assumption is that it went south , and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor , ' said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
the view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane crossed their airspace , and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor .			2

images from map search site show potential ' sightings ' of plane and debris
the authenticity of the photos has not yet been verified
investigators believe plane most likely flew into southern @entity23
news comes as villagers in @entity115 report seeing flight at low altitude
