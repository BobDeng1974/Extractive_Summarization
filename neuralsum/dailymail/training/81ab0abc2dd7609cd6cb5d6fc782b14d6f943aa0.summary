it is the stuff of science fiction - a white t - shirt that can be fully immersed in red wine and come out clean , and bone dry			2
but now there is a $ 20 product , launching this week at @entity7 , that can do just that			1
@entity9 , a superhydrophobic spray , actively repels liquids to protect everything from your favorite cream dress to a pair of white sneakers from ever getting stained again			2
' everyone is going to want to try it out			0
' the product was designed by @entity31 , which was faced with the challenge of fixing rusting pipes under the sea , and set to work to find a substance that would coat the metal to prevent rusting			1
available to buy : the $ 20 product is available at @entity7 , and will soon be available at other @entity39 stores in the course of their experimentation , they found the resulting substance - a silicone - based spray - could have infinite uses in the worlds of fashion , technology and engineering			1
not only is @entity9 , the first such consumer product to enter the market , impervious to any liquid substance , including oils , mud and condiments , but it actively deflects moisture leaving no trace whatsoever on its surface			1
in a video released by the company , a man in pristine white deck shoes - one coated in @entity64 , one simply plain canvas - jumps into a muddy puddle			0
after swishing his feet around in the muck , he steps out to reveal the uncoated shoe covered in a thick layer of mud			0
as the @entity75 coated shoe emerges however , the mud shoots off the surface , leaving the canvas bone dry and completely unmarked			1
in another demonstration , chocolate sauce is poured onto the coated shoe , which slips off leaving not a trace			0
and on a treated white t - shirt , engine oil , apple sauce and orange juice form convex fluid globules that speed off the surface of the fabric			0
not only could footwear companies use the coating to thoroughly waterproof their shoes , but a fabric with such effective repellant qualities could prove priceless to firms producing ski equipment , sailing and fishing gear or wet weather clothing , as well as being used as a protector for upholstery , tablecloths or napkins in restaurants			0
no more stains : @entity9 , the first such consumer product to enter the market , is impervious to any liquid substance , including oils , mud and condiments , and actively deflects moisture waterproof : in this demonstration , mustard is poured onto the coated shoe , which slips off leaving just a few beads behind , which then brush off and its uses can extend beyond simple fabric treatment too			2
studies have proved it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets ; protecting iphones and ipods that previously would have been rendered useless after being submerged in water			2
in an experiment by @entity31 , an @entity126 was left in a bowl of water for 30 minutes - and came out unscathed			0
stain free : on a treated white t - shirt , chocolate sauce forms convex fluid globules that speed off the surface of the fabric repelling soda : the coating could prove priceless to firms producing ski equipment , sailing and fishing gear or wet weather clothing , as well as being used as a protector for upholstery , tablecloths or napkins in restaurants how it works : @entity75 creates microscopic nano - particles across the surface it coats , when liquids hit the superhydrophobic barrier , it forms a nearly circular bead that causes the liquid to shoot off the surface this so - called superhydrophic substance was developed only in the last decade as scientists tried to mimic the water - repellent properties of the @entity158 lotus plant			1
@entity159 found that , contrary to expectations , smooth surfaces actually encourage liquids to stick			0
@entity75 creates microscopic nano - particles across the surface it coats			1
when water hits the coating 's superhydrophobic barrier , it forms a nearly circular bead that either causes the liquid to shoot off the surface or never cling there in the first place			0
water damage no more : studies have proved it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets ; protecting iphones that previously would have been rendered useless after being submerged in water among other things , it can be used on metal , wood , masonry and aluminum as well as fabric , leather and canvas			2
according to @entity31 , applications of @entity75 can be as diverse as making toilet plungers water repellant so they attract less bacteria , forming anti-corrosive coatings on metal , and as an anti-icing device , protecting surfaces prone to freezing , such as aeroplanes , piping and electrical transmission lines .			1

@entity75 , $ 20 , is a waterproofing product now available at @entity7
