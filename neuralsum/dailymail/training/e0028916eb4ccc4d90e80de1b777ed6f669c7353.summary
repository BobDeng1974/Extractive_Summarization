by @entity0 for the @entity1 we all know the @entity4 ’s definition of a ‘ homegrown ’ player is rather loose — players of any nationality are homegrown as long they have been at any @entity9 club for three years before their 21st birthday			1
@entity11 at @entity12 , @entity13 at @entity14 and @entity15 at @entity16 count as homegrown for their new clubs			1
but what about truly homegrown players ? this weekend in the @entity4 only nine clubs fielded players in their starting xi who qualify for a home nations country and were developed by their club			2
@entity9 forward @entity29 grabbed @entity31 's winner against @entity32 at @entity33 on the weekend @entity34 has started all four of @entity36 's league matches so far this season @entity37 progressed through @entity39 's academy before joining @entity36 @entity40 has remained at @entity12 despite the club 's influx of foreign stars in recent years @entity36 , @entity31 , @entity44 and @entity45 were the only club to start with more than one			2
@entity47 named @entity48 and @entity34 in his side which comfortably defeated @entity51 on sunday			0
@entity52 and @entity53 both started for @entity45 in their 2 - 2 draw a @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 started for @entity44 while @entity31 match winner @entity29 was one of two homegrown players to start for @entity59 's side at @entity33			0
@entity60 did not name one @entity16 academy graduate in his side which started at @entity14			0

@entity34 and @entity48 were one of two homegrown players to start at @entity63 at the weekend
@entity11 , @entity13 and @entity15 are all *classed* by the @entity4 despite *previously* *spending* time at other sides
@entity16 and @entity67 were among the teams who did not start a player who had progress through their academy
