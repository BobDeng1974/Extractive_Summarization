the @entity1 football stars charged with raping a 16 - year - old girl in a night of degradation and humiliation have been found guilty			1
in emotional courtroom scenes , both defendants @entity6 , 17 , and @entity7 , 16 , wept uncontrollably as judge @entity9 handed down his verdict , describing their actions as ‘ profane and ugly			1
’ as @entity6 and @entity13 were comforted by their attorneys and their families sobbed , prosecutor @entity12 pressed for a stern sentencing reminding the judge : ‘ they showed absolutely no regard for what happened to the victim			1
‘ the lack of remorse was appalling ’ today , as both @entity51 students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened that august night last year , their remorse appeared overwhelming			1
both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21			1
judge @entity9 talks from the bench to the families of @entity6 and @entity63 after he pronounced them delinquent on rape and other charges after their trial in juvenile court in @entity28 , @entity1 family members console each other as judge @entity9 ( not shown ) delivers the verdicts in the trial of @entity24 , 16 and @entity6 , 17 , in juvenile court in @entity28 , @entity1 , march 17 , 2013 family ties : @entity24 , center , stands with his father , @entity75 , left , and attorney @entity35 after he and co-defendant @entity6 , 17 , were found delinquent @entity6 faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor			1
he received the same sentence for that to run consecutively			2
his minimum detention is two years			1
his actions were , according to @entity85 , ‘ more egregious ’ making it inappropriate that he should face the same sentence as @entity13			2
guilty : @entity24 , top , hugs his mother @entity89 , after closing arguments were made on the fourth day of the juvenile trial on saturday court proceedings : @entity7 , 16 , ( left ) and @entity6 , 17 , ( right ) in court on saturday ; both were found guilty today of raping a teenage girl last summer trial by social media : the messages over @entity98 , @entity99 and text that were exchanged that night and the next day have become central to the case - and to the outrage it has caused nationwide verdict : two protestors hug outside the @entity105 after hearing the verdict in the trial @entity13 ’s father , @entity108 , who has been present in court every day made his way over to his son , fell to his knees and told him that he loved him			1
‘ my life is ruined , ’ @entity7 told attorney his @entity35 , who was clearly shocked at the verdict			2
@entity116 father , @entity115 , held his head in his hands as the defendant ’s sister @entity119 and mother wept			2
both defendants took the opportunity to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a screened off section of seating			2
@entity6 was composed as he said : ‘ i would like to apologize to [ the victim ] and her family , my family and the community			1
no pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken			2
’ but though @entity6 apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape			1
in every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 august he repeatedly denied raping her			1
in fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made			2
again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim , hectoring her , pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘ did n’t happen			0
’ standing in court , convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret , the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize			0
in court : @entity6 , 17 , talks with one of his defense lawyers , @entity158 yesterday when it came to @entity13 ’s turn , he walked towards the victim and her family , across the courtroom , weeping ; ‘ i would like to apologize			1
i had no intention to put you guys through this			0
i do n’t know what to say			0
‘ i ruined her life			0
’ at this , he could no longer speak because he was overcome with tears , and was walked back to this seat by @entity171 , chief probation officer for @entity172			0
apologies followed from @entity174 , @entity175 – @entity13 ’s guardian who , along with his wife @entity177 have been in court every day			0
the @entity179 ’s have spoken openly about their support for @entity13 and love for him ‘ whatever happened			0
’ today in court they appeared emotionally shattered			1
@entity13 was not in their care when the events took place			0
the @entity1 rape convictions do not mark the end of the scandal that has gripped the small town of @entity28 and @entity190 at large			0
ohio attorney general @entity191 , right , answers questions about the successful prosecution of two juveniles @entity195 attorney general @entity191 has revealed that a @entity196 will be called on april 15 with as many as 16 other youths facing possible charges			1
speaking just moments after judge @entity9 handed down his verdict , @entity195 attorney @entity191 has revealed : ‘ we ’ve gone a long way in this investigation and we ’re almost there			1
the grand jury will finish up that investigation			0
’ he said that there were 16 people of interest who had so far refused to co-operate with the investigation			1
the @entity196 will seek to resolve this and while he acknowledged it is more commonly concerned with criminal cases in the adult court he said it also served as ‘ an investigating tool ’ in matters relating to @entity172			0
the three key prosecution witnesses – all of whom admitted being present and participating in the events of august 11 - 12 – were all granted immunity on condition of their testimony			1
many campaigning groups have heavily criticized the controversial decision but it was a decision that the victim ’s family understood as solicitor mr @entity230 explained : ‘ you had three boys , eye witnesses to what happened			0
they [ attorney general ’s office } had to make a difficult decision to grant three people we all think were probably criminally liable immunity			0
‘ their conduct was reprehensible and despicable but sometimes you have to make deals			0
’ all three could still face charges outside the @entity1 if they are found to have sent nude images of a minor across county lines			0
the victim herself is from @entity248 , barely three miles from @entity28 but across state lines and in @entity250			0
summing up : judge @entity9 listens to prosecuting attorney @entity12 give a closing argument saturday ; he declared the defendants guilty today mr @entity35 said : ‘ to some extent they blame themselves			1
’ it would be hard to understate the intensity of the courtroom scenes as all three young people - defendants and victim – and their families took in the devastation this case has wrought on their lives			1
this was not a time of jubilation on the victim ’s family ’s part – they declined the opportunity to address the court			2
this was a time for the defendants to absorb the fact that this finding will be , as mr @entity35 put it , ‘ an escort for the rest of their lives			2
’ across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts , tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends			0
small town : both defendants played football for @entity51 's team @entity51 they have heard about pictures , been reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did and how they behaved , who they were , when nobody else was looking			1
the case has scandalized @entity190 and scarred the small town of @entity28 , @entity1			0
@entity6 and @entity13 will begin their sentence today			1
they will be taken to an institute just northwest of @entity303 , @entity1 where they will be assessed and a decision made as to where they should spend their time in custody			2
‘ so much of what happens with their future depends upon their attitude and how they embrace their rehabilitation , ’ said judge @entity9			2
‘ there is plenty of room to demonstrate your good character			0
there is also plenty of room to make mistakes			0
’ on the map : the working class town of @entity28 , located in eastern @entity1 , has a population of around 18,000			0

judge ruled today that @entity6 , 16 , and @entity24 , 17 , both students at @entity51 , are guilty of raping girl , 16 , at *alcohol* - *fueled* party last summer
will serve out *yearlong* - sentences at juvenile detention center , and could serve time until they turn 21
