@entity0 apparently have no interest in funding retirement of their star as celebrity retirement homes go , this one is disappointingly low key			1
there are no chaises longues , no gilded mirrors , no hot and cold running servants , and no carb - free meals arriving under silver domes			1
there is n’t even a telly ( though there was one once — showing westerns and old episodes of @entity19 all day long )			2
fancy a cuppa ? choppers , in the wig , starring in a @entity0 advert instead , there ’s a large mound of grass populated by a couple of tree stumps , and a very basic climbing - frame draped with rope , all enclosed by a mini-moat and high smeary glass walls			1
inside , behind two floppy plastic doors , is a large area covered in straw			2
there are four shelves for beds and lights go out at 8pm			2
choppers the last surviving @entity42 @entity0 chimp and , in the @entity43 , one of our biggest television stars this is home to @entity40 , the last surviving @entity42 @entity0 chimp and , in the @entity43 , one of our biggest television stars			1
now 42 years old , she has a kindly face , a bit of a stoop and a lot of very bristly facial hairs			1
she potters about her enclosure in @entity58 in @entity59 , occasionally stopping for a sniff , a scratch or a rub against the tree stump			1
her previous incarnation — dressed in flowery frocks and enormous wigs , proffering cups of tea and opening fetes , shopping arcades and new schools — seems quite unbelievable			2
but memories have come rushing back after zoo officials claimed that @entity40 ( along with the rest of ‘ the @entity75 ’ ) was irretrievably damaged by her brush with celebrity and human contact during her developing years			2
‘ she ’s mixed up			2
she did n’t know how to interact with other chimps			2
it ’s taken years for her to re-integrate , ’ said @entity80 , of @entity58			1
to add insult to injury , @entity0 apparently have no interest in funding the retirement of their one - time star			1
it ’s hardly surprising if @entity40 is a bit confused			0
for at the height of their fame , the @entity58 chimps did n’t exactly lead normal lives			1
under the loving ( if , with the benefit of hindsight , misguided ) supervision of the zoo ’s eccentric founder , @entity101 , they starred in countless commercials , became massive stars and helped fund @entity105 as it is today			0
it all began in 1956 , back when nobody baulked at the thought of dressing up wild animals in pinnies and blue - rinse wigs and training them to iron shirts , ride exercise bikes and sip daintily from china cups and saucers			1
@entity40 in one of the @entity0 adverts that aired during the 1970s for nearly three decades , generations of @entity58 chimps posed as tea ladies , exercise fanatics , @entity123 ( ‘ @entity124 ’ ) @entity125 , cowboys with ten - gallon hats and six shooters and @entity130 cyclists , all to sell more tea			1
perhaps the most enduring advert featured two removal men — mr @entity0 and son — wrestling with a piano stuck on the stairs			1
the apprentice asks his dad if he knows the piano is on his foot , earning the reply : ‘ you hum it , son , i ’ll play it			0
’ @entity148 ’s big moment — wearing a flowery dress , frilly pink pinny and blue rinse wig , she offers them a consolatory cup of tea			0
although we could never admit it now , the adverts ( voiced by , among others , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 ) were brilliantly funny			0
popular : picture shows the chimps trainer @entity166 with ' @entity167 ' in 1986 and they were fantastic for business			0
within two years , @entity0 went from fourth in the market to @entity42 ’s top - selling tea			1
for their part , the chimps — all young and bouncy and brilliantly malleable and adaptable — had an absolute ball			0
they are natural show - offs and adored the attention			1
they are also fantastic mimics , highly intelligent and with 98.5 per cent of their dna identical to humans , very easy to teach			0
each action — pouring tea , ironing , man - handling a piano — was broken down into a series of parts and demonstrated over and over until they could n’t resist mimicking			2
everywhere they went they caused a stir			0
they hosted tea parties watched by enormous awestruck crowds , appeared on @entity194 and @entity195 and even took part in a race from @entity199 ’s @entity198 to the @entity200 in @entity201 , staying in five - star hotels where they enjoyed room service			1
instead of the recommended chimpanzee diet of leaves , fruit and the occasional low - flying bird , they were fed sugary tea , jam sandwiches for breakfast and snacked on buns , ice cream and boiled eggs			2
@entity216 : one of the @entity0 monkeys with handler @entity101 meanwhile , they lounged around on heated beds for up to seven hours a day watching westerns and the wrestling on their own wide - screen television			1
some could even work the remote control and use a human toilet			0
@entity101 and her partner , @entity225 , hand - reared dozens of baby chimps in a house in the grounds of the zoo			2
at one stage , several of the chimps lived with them , cuddled up on the sofa and even accompanied them the hairdresser			0
but as they approached maturity , between six or eight years old , such domestic bliss came to a halt			0
they were too big , too dangerous			0
according to @entity40 ’s current keeper , adult chimps are five times stronger than humans and can be killers if provoked — and are prone to aggressive outbursts			0
the @entity248 chimps making their 100th tv commercial in @entity250 in 1986 for choppers , the celebrity life ended in the mid-seventies			2
for other , younger , chimps coming up through the ranks , the high life continued up to the @entity257 , until , uncomfortable at the demand for increasingly ornate outfits and wigs , @entity101 withdrew her apes from their @entity0 contract			1
although the chimps ’ time being treated as humans was at most five or six years , according to dr @entity267 , the zoo ’s head of life sciences , the damage was done			0
‘ it ’s not a good start in life to be treated like a human			0
it means they do n’t learn ape behaviour and they ’re not very good at being with other chimps , ’ she says			0
since then , poor @entity148 has been trapped between two worlds — half - chimp , half - human			1
it did n’t help that , as long as @entity101 stayed in charge at @entity105 , certain privileges remained — tv , sugary tea , jam sandwiches , chocolate bars , toys to play with			0
fame : a chimp films a @entity0 advert in 1989 which was part of a campaign which cost £ 5million and although , in the wild , chimps live in groups , choppers and her long - term companion @entity304 ( aka @entity303 ) were given private accommodation			1
there is no question that @entity101 ( who died in 2007 , aged 93 ) adored her chimps and meant well			0
she was a world authority on primates and the tv revenue transformed the zoo from a few sheds to a thriving breeding centre			0
‘ the chimps would do anything for her , ’ says retired mail photographer @entity315 , who spent a lot of time with @entity101			0
‘ they loved dressing up and watching themselves on telly			0
you forgot they were chimps and thought they were children			0
‘ there was no cruelty involved			0
she ’d know immediately if they ’d had enough and never pushed it			0
’ while life got back to normal at @entity105 , @entity0 looked elsewhere for chimps — first in @entity337 and then @entity338 , until the tea firm killed off @entity340 in 2002			1
adverts : choppers , a 42 - year - old ape , became one of the stars of the @entity347 tea adverts in the 1970s			1
she lived in a cage at the zoo with co-star @entity304 ( pictured right in the advert ) until he died at the age of 37 last july meanwhile , life rumbled on in @entity59 for @entity356 until , last year , the latter passed away , aged 37			1
today , @entity358 spends her time lounging about , foraging for food and playing a brain game with boxes of hidden food and a stick and occasionally even taking part in the all - important mutual grooming sessions with her new pals @entity368 , @entity369 and @entity370			2
meanwhile , @entity58 is busy trying to erase links with @entity0			1
there is no mention of @entity0 on the website , no merchandise in the shop , no photos on the wall , not even a commemorative plaque on @entity40 ’ enclosure			1
there , ever the performer , she ’s still keen to put on a bit of show			0
i watch as this showbusiness veteran climbs atop the tree stump , scratches , sniffs , urinates , smacks her lips , jumps up and down a bit and grins			0
there ’s not a flowery pinny in sight , and she happily looks much more chimp than human			2

choppers is the last surviving member of the @entity402 ' family ' at the zoo			1

choppers was huge star but is now last surviving @entity42 @entity0 chimp
