for those who happen to support @entity2 , @entity0 needs no introduction			1
for those who do n't , @entity0 was a giant of a centre - forward through the ' 70s and ' 80s , a prolific goalscorer and leader of the line with majestic aerial prowess			2
he represented nine different clubs , making 749 @entity13 appearances , and many more as he played on in non-league , but it was at @entity2 , his hometown club where he is a legend , and the record scorer with 191 goals in three spells at the club			1
when the @entity22 club enjoyed their most glorious moments , he was usually around : for promotion in 1970 and 1985 and the @entity25 win in 1981 , when @entity2 overcame @entity26 on the way to winning a rare if obscure trophy			2
@entity0 , pictured while coaching @entity29 , is suffering from @entity30 @entity0 gets above @entity32 's @entity31 during a clash at @entity34 in 1981 @entity0 made 749 @entity13 appearances during his time as a player @entity38 's disease is a form of dementia			1
it is caused when certain nerve cells in the brain die and the pathway connectors change			0
it can lead to a change of personality and behaviour			0
off the field he was gentle , articulate , friendly and genuinely popular ; a hometown hero who opened a sports shop in the town when his professional playing career finally ended and he and went on to manage several clubs in @entity56			0
these days , at the age of 65 , @entity0 still looks in the good shape - former @entity2 goalkeeper @entity58 insists he is ' the most naturally - fit player ' he has ever encountered - and he still exercises regularly but his mind is not the same			1
@entity0 suffers from @entity30 , a type of frontotemporal dementia caused by the destruction of nerve cells in the brain , which affects his memory and communication			1
the first symptoms were noticed more than 10 years ago and he was diagnosed eight years ago , although his family did not make his illness public until last year			1
there is no cure and he has already survived the normal life expectancy			0
proof is difficult , but his family , friends and former team - mates are convinced this early onset of dementia is related to heading the ball as often as he did throughout a 20 - year career of 749 games			0
@entity0 , pictured playing for @entity2 , was a prolific striker for the @entity82 there are parallels to former @entity85 and @entity87 centre - forward @entity86 and other footballers from the same era who were powerful in the air and have suffered degenerative brain diseases			2
@entity0 was certainly renowned for his heading ability , not only at @entity2 but with all the teams he played for in the @entity13 : @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
' most will agree @entity0 was not the best ball - player or dribbler but he was by far one of the best centre forwards around at that time , ' said @entity58 , who became @entity2 's commercial manager when his career ended and has been in the role for more than 30 years			1
' he was a towering target - man , always dangerous in the air to the opposition at corners and free - kicks , very difficult to mark in the box , could always read the game well and had the knack of being in the right place at the right time , particularly in the penalty area which made him a good natural goalscorer			0
' on saturday , @entity2 will host ' @entity120 ' in his honour when they play @entity97 , in @entity122 to raise awareness of the condition and funds for research charities			0
@entity127 has lavished praise on @entity0 by calling the striker a ' great goalscorer ' @entity0 was voted @entity97 's @entity131 in 1982 and @entity127 recalled how he helped shape his career as he emerged as a young player at @entity34			2
' he was a great goalscorer but when i played with him in the early ' 80s , he knew how to create chances for others , ' said @entity127			0
@entity2 will have items on sale at the @entity138 including limited - edition badges , a special edition of the match - day programme dedicated to his career and an ale brewed by the local @entity143 called ' @entity0 '			2
some of his former team - mates will be in attendance , along with @entity0 and his family , wife @entity147 and daughters @entity148 and @entity150 .			0
