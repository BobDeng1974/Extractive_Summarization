by @entity0 a woman had an epic meltdown this week on a @entity4 , @entity5 - bound flight			1
the unidentified woman screamed over and over at the top of her lungs after going up and down the aisles of the plane telling people to pray for her deceased mother			1
‘ @entity18 you ’re my savior , ’ she repeated as often and quickly as possible , while contorting and shaking in her seat as shocked passengers tried not to draw her attention			1
perhaps distraught over the recent loss of her mother , the woman is seen at the beginning of the video screaming ‘ @entity18 you ’re my savior ’ at the top of her lungs			1
shot by @entity39 , video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical woman trying to calm her down			2
his failure to calm her elicits an exasperated shrug of the shoulders			0
‘ she ’s been freaking out for the last 20 minutes , ’ mr @entity39 explains over the shouting woman			2
‘ she started off by telling everyone to pray for her mother who just passed away			0
‘ she went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother , ’ mr @entity39 further explains as the woman ’s tirade shows no signs of slowing down			0
‘ get me out of here : the woman in the aisle seat ca n't get off the plane fast enough the woman appears to be both looking at her powered on smartphone and reading a magazine while repeatedly screaming ‘ @entity18 you ’re my savior ’ in non-stop repetition			1
the man sitting next to her continues to try to calm her down as passengers shown behind her are tiring of the routine			0
‘ i do n’t know if this guy next to her knows her or not , ’ mr @entity39 further narrates over the unending barrage of proclamation , ‘ but he ’s been trying to calm her down the whole time			0
’ the plane then appears to touch down on the airport runway , as it visibly shakes before lights and other vehicles are then seen outside the window behind the distraught woman			2
the man ’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her , as she points and yells ‘ do n’t f * * king touch me ’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to @entity18 for cursing			1
she then goes right back into repeating ‘ @entity18 you ’re my savior and fast and loud as she can			1
clearly distraught : the crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant right as she appears to run out of steam , finally quieting down , mr @entity39 explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman does n’t make a run for the plane ’s door			1
‘ if she tries to go back , we ’re going to block her , ’ mr @entity39 said as the woman ’s meltdown caught a second wind			0
though not as loud and fast as before , the mantra is repeated over and over			0
it is not clear what the woman ’s ultimate fate was , she has not been publicly identified			0
then , like a voice from the heavens , an automated message advised passengers to ‘ remain in their seats ’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate			0
@entity120 had finally come for the passengers , the end of their hellish flight .			2

the unidentified woman had recently lost a *parent*
she screamed ' @entity18 you *'re* my savior ' over and over as the plane made it *'s* final *descent*
*worried* she would make a run for the door , flight attendants *instructed* passengers to stop her if she tried to leave her seat
