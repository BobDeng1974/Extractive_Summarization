fish are often classed as ugly , slimy creatures but these latest images reveal their inner beauty			2
each of the marine specimens have been bleached to make the skin clear and then stained to expose their complex and elegant skeletons			1
they include the @entity8 , the @entity9 and the @entity10 and form part of the cleared exhibition due to go on display in @entity14 in march			0
the fish in the cleared exhibition , including the including this @entity17 , pictured , were bleached before being dyed to make the stained skeletal tissue visible through the skin and flesh			1
they were then submerged in a large container of glycerine and photographed in various poses			2
the process is used in the science of @entity27 the project was created by professor @entity29 , associate director of @entity27 at @entity30			0
he collected the specimens from various fisheries , with many having died during scientific studies			2
one study , for example , had focused on the developmental trajectory of the fish skeleton			2
the fish were treated at the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity41			0
each fish was stained using two specific dyes - @entity44 to stain the cartilaginous elements deep blue , and @entity47 to turn the tissue a crimson colour			1
the fish were then bleached in hydrogen peroxide to remove any dark pigments			1
the fish , including this @entity8 , were treated at the @entity39 at @entity40 in @entity54			0
each fish was stained using two specific dyes : @entity44 to stain the cartilaginous elements deep blue , and @entity47 to turn the tissue a crimson colour			1
the fish were then bleached in hydrogen peroxide to remove any dark pigments the project was created by professor @entity29 , associate director of @entity27 at @entity30			1
he collected the specimens , including this @entity9 , from various fisheries , fish that died during scientific studies and from a study on the developmental trajectory of the fish skeleton flesh from the specimens were dissolved in a digestive enzyme called @entity75 which removed the protein , but left the collagen that holds the bones and skin together intact			1
to make the fish appear invisible , each specimen was then submerged in glycerine and placed into various poses before being photographed using a @entity85 camera fitted with a 100mm macro lens			1
professor @entity29 told @entity88 , where the display is being held : â€˜ this technique is only effective on specimens that are less than about 1cm in thickness , and takes much longer for thick specimens than thin			0
flesh from the specimens were dissolved in a digestive enzyme called @entity75 which removes the protein , but leaves the collagen that holds the bones and skin intact , as seen in this @entity10			1
to make the fish appear invisible , each specimen was then submerged in glycerine and placed into various poses before being photographed using a @entity85 camera fitted with a 100mm macro lens ' a small fish might take three days to process while a larger animal could take several months			1
' professor @entity29 continued that he has a camera on a tripod and uses a remote shutter release to take the shots each time			0
to make sure the glycerine is still , professor @entity29 said he poses the fish and leaves the set up for several hours before taking the images			2
the glycerine is placed on a colour corrected @entity119 light table to highlight the specimens			0
there are 14 specimens in total in the display			0
the six featured here include the @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity17 , @entity10 and @entity127			0
professor @entity29 said that he has a camera on a tripod and uses a remote shutter release to take the shots each time to make sure the glycerine was still and there were no light reflections , professor @entity29 said he posed the fish and left the set up for several hours before taking the images			0
he then shot them using a camera on a tripod with a remote shutter control			0

the staining processes used in @entity143 date back almost 40 years
each of the fish specimens are dyed to expose their skeletal tissue using red and blue pigments
a digestive enzyme called @entity75 removes the protein from the specimens , but leaves the collagen
the fish is then bleached to remove any dark pigments in the dye before being submerged in glycerin
