the @entity0 laughed with trainer @entity6 on monday after @entity5 , most famed for representing @entity7 in 1995 , gave him a custom - made speed ball with @entity3 's face painted on it			1

@entity0 is the underdog for the bout , billed as @entity50 and tipped to gross more than £ 300m , but you would n't know it from his quiet confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with @entity6 at his @entity27 base			1
while sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum , @entity0 looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on tuesday at the @entity62 gym , just off @entity63 in @entity64			1
for victory the eight - division world champion must do what no - one has done in @entity3 's 47 - fight career and inflict defeat on the @entity70 from @entity71 , a five - division world champion in his own right and , of course , the holder of the welterweight titles they 'll be fighting for			1

' let me confirm that @entity3 indeed has been coping with hand injuries			2
he has some skin marks on his knuckles			0
he even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied , lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing 's pound - for - pound king , ' @entity117 wrote			0
they are n't injuries to be worried about though , says @entity117 , just like the reported calf problems @entity0 is said to have been struggling with			2
it would be a surprise if they did n't have some aches and pains			0
and it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early april had any effect on a fight scheduled in early may , ' he added			0
it 's thirsty work for @entity0 with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against @entity3 pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with @entity6 and his close - knit entourage last week @entity0 's own sparring was cut short after @entity159 technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight			1
@entity6 decided to call it a day for his fighter , who had only been running the day before			0
@entity166 reported @entity112 saying that @entity0 did n't want to keep the @entity159 officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout			2
' since it took a while to get it done , @entity6 ( @entity6 ) asked @entity0 to take off , ' @entity112 reportedly said			2
@entity112 then said @entity3 was ' getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and could n't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time @entity3 got hit , it bled			0
' @entity3 does n't appear too bothered though , tweeting on friday : ' i always have the remedy to do what i have to do to come out on top			0
