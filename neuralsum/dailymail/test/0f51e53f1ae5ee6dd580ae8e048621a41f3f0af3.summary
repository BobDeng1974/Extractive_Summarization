new low : the mortgage market has reached a ‘ watershed ’ moment with the launch of the first five - year fixed rate below 2 per cent the offer from one of the country ’s biggest mortgage lenders – @entity10 is consistently in the top five – launches on monday and is expected to trigger a flood of rate cuts by other banks and building societies			1
fifteen lenders had already cut rates across their ranges in the past week , but more are likely to follow now @entity10 has set a new benchmark			2
brokers said lenders appeared to be slashing rates ready for the ‘ spring mortgage spree ’ when many families move or remortgage			2
mortgage broker @entity40 , of @entity42 , said : ‘ the breaking of the 2 per cent barrier for a five - year fix is a watershed moment and one many thought would never be seen in the @entity48			1
‘ other lenders will now look to compete , but there is only so low they can go before their profit margins start to become too squeezed			0
‘ the current crop of low fixed rates could help to spur more borrowers into action as they lock in before these rates disappear			0
’ @entity10 already had one of the lowest five - year fixes on the market at 2.19 per cent , but decided to under - cut itself to try to steal more customers from its rivals			1
the only cheaper deal was offered by @entity65 at 2.09 per cent , but it was available only on loans over £ 200,000 and for those remortgaging , and carried a fee of £ 1,995			0
with the @entity10 rate cut from 2.19 per cent to 1.99 per cent , a homeowner borrowing £ 200,000 over a 25 - year term would save more than £ 1,100 during the five - year deal			1
the offer is available only to those with a deposit of at least 40 per cent , with a £ 1,499 fee			0
other than the usual affordability criteria , there are no other restrictions			0
the battle between lenders has intensified in recent months , plunging home loan rates to their lowest in history mortgage broker @entity84 , of @entity86 and @entity87 , said : ‘ this is an astonishing low rate for a five - year fixed rate and certainly moves the market on again after a recent lull			1
they are laying down a marker for other lenders			0
’ the mortgage war has erupted six years after the @entity96 slashed its base rate to a historic low of 0.5 per cent to try to boost economic growth during the financial crisis			0
recent economic growth had prompted speculation that interest rates could rise this year			2
but , with the inflation rate at zero , analysts believe the rate is unlikely to rise until the middle of 2016			0
this has allowed lenders to offer even cheaper fixed - rate mortgages with more confidence			2
@entity112 , at @entity113 , said : ‘ this 1.99 per cent deal is the first five - year fixed - rate mortgage to be launched below 2 per cent			1
‘ the competition to be the lowest in the mortgage market shows no signs of stopping and is great news for borrowers			0
’ the average rate on a five - year fixed rate on offer , across all deposits , is now 3.55 per cent , compared to 4.04 per cent a year ago			1
five years ago , the average five - year fixed rate was 5.87 per cent			2
increased competition from new banks such as @entity65 and @entity129 has forced major banks and building societies to compete harder , according to experts			1
they said banks had a ‘ high appetite ’ to lend at the moment as the economy continues to recover , and were desperate to attract custom			0
but brokers warned that tougher lending criteria meant these cut - price deals were not available to everyone , including older borrowers and the self - employed			0
experts warned that borrowers looking for a fixed - rate mortgage deal must consider the whole package rather than the headline interest rate , and factor in any fees , which can add significantly to the overall cost of the loan			1
brokers said that the @entity10 1.99 per cent offer was likely to be on the market for at least a week , if not several , depending on the demand .			0
