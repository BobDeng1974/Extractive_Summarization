@entity0 delivered one of their worst performances of the season and @entity4 had his first off day of the year as @entity6 ’s team were beaten 1 - 0 at home by @entity9 just three days before they face @entity7			1
if @entity10 wants a masterclass in how to play @entity0 he need only look to the way his old club have played them this season			1
they drew 0 - 0 at @entity16 earlier in the season and never looked into too much trouble at the @entity18 after @entity19 put them ahead on seven minutes after a mistake by @entity22			1
@entity0 looked fragile at the back with @entity9 ’s lightning breaks exposing their high defensive line			1
they were second to everything in midfield and with @entity4 and @entity28 strangely below par they blew their big chance to go top of @entity33			0
@entity9 's striker @entity19 ( left ) celebrates after scoring the opening goal at the @entity18 @entity0 forward @entity4 ( left ) vies with @entity9 's forward @entity36 ( right ) on saturday @entity0 started brightly enough with @entity37 forcing several corners but from the second @entity9 broke away to score			1
@entity39 saved @entity37 ’ header and the former @entity42 keeper , booed for his ties to @entity0 ’s @entity45 rivals , set - up the first goal of the game with a long kick down the pitch			1
it looked harmless enough as it dropped out of the sky with @entity22 underneath it			1
but the full - back miscontrolled it as he tried to send it back to keeper @entity58			0
@entity9 ’s 21 - year - old striker @entity19 pounced on the error and with @entity58 slow to come out and cover @entity22 ’ mistake the forward was able to slip it past him and make it 1 - 0			1
@entity0 did their best to respond immediately but @entity39 came out to clear an @entity66 cross ahead of @entity37 who complained the keeper had used his elbows as both players went for the ball			1
@entity72 then had a shot blocked by @entity74 on the line			0
the @entity0 midfielder was then booked for bringing down @entity77 as things went from bad to worse for the home side			1
@entity0 defender @entity22 ( right ) tussles for possession with @entity9 midfielder @entity82 ( left ) @entity0 were finding no way through @entity9 ’s two banks of four defence and the tactic of hanging high balls up for @entity37 was proving food and drink to @entity39 who dominated his area			1
when @entity4 crossed from the right he did manage to keep it far enough away from the keeper but from the chance @entity28 made an uncharacteristic mess of his control and the ball ran out for a goal kick			2
moments later @entity28 combined brilliantly with @entity98 and his cross was bound for @entity4 but former @entity101 defender @entity100 got to the ball first			2
@entity37 crossed from left but @entity28 could n’t control the ball			0
then roles were reversed with @entity107 ’s cross cut out before it reached @entity37			0
@entity4 , meanwhile , was mysteriously peripheral			0
the tactic of having him spend more time wide right this season has worked since the turn of the year but not here			0
@entity0 's @entity4 looks on dejected after @entity19 's goal put visitors @entity9 ahead in the first half @entity0 supporters behind @entity39 ’s goal sang sarcastically about how much they love @entity117 – after the @entity120 ’s recent decision to charge the club for singing ‘ @entity117 is a drunk ’ songs – and the @entity18 waited for the first half equalizer , but it never came			1
at times it was @entity9 who looked more likely to get the game ’s next goal			1
they were dangerous on the break with @entity36 playing in @entity128			0
he flicked the ball to @entity131 and only a @entity58 save stopped the second goal			2
@entity22 then allowed @entity36 to get away from him and @entity133 was lucky not to have been judged to have fouled the forward as he cleared up his team - mate ’s mistake			1
@entity22 had been particularly bad but the sloppiness had spread through the team and going forward there was a complete lack of punch			1
@entity133 ( right ) is at full stretch in an attempt to keep the ball in play during saturday 's @entity33 clash from a @entity4 centre @entity98 headed weakly at @entity147 with the effort never looking like beating @entity39			2
it was fitting that the last kick of the first half was an aimless crossfield pass from @entity4 that went straight to a blue and white striped shirt			0
from their talisman to their previously unflappable keeper @entity0 had been awful			2
with no notable improvement at the start of the second period @entity6 sent on midfielder @entity159			0
the @entity160 replaced @entity72 on the hour			0
@entity37 took the fight to @entity9 but strayed offside running onto a @entity4 pass and was also just the wrong side of his marker when @entity165 played him through with his first kick after replacing @entity98			2
@entity37 writhes around in agony as his side searched for a response to get back into the game as @entity37 played @entity159 down the right he was flagged offside too – @entity9 played the tactic well but were being helped a linesman who seemed not to agree with level being onside			2
@entity37 was inline with the last defender as he ran onto @entity4 ’s pass and could not believe it when the official raised his flag			0
when @entity165 finally beat the offside trap he sent his shot into the side - netting			0
with 15 minutes left @entity184 replaced @entity22 at right back			2
it was hardly the substitution that was going to change the game but it was a chance to point the finger at the player whose mistake had started the whole shambles			0
this was @entity0 ’s first defeat since the first game of the year when @entity195 ’ @entity194 beat them			2
after that game the blame was all placed at tinkering @entity6 ’s door			0
this time the buck stops squarely with the players and @entity7 ’s only fear will be that they will be more determined than ever to put things right in their next game			0
reflecting on his side 's performance at the @entity18 , @entity0 boss @entity6 was less than impressed : ' i would go as far as to say we deserved to lose the game			1
' it ’s an advantage that we have a game in just three days time and it ’s a very big one			0

@entity9 put themselves ahead with a first half goal from @entity19
the visitors *capitalised* on a mistake by @entity0 defender @entity22
despite having the lion 's share of possession @entity0 could *n't* respond
