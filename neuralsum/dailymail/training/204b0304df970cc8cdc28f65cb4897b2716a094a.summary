the @entity0 ruled on thursday that state officials are n't violating the rights of a 17 - year - old girl by forcing her to undergo cancer chemotherapy she does n't want			1
the decision came in the case of the girl known in court documents only as @entity9 , who will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in september			1
she , with the support of her mother , had fought against the six - month course of chemotherapy which doctors said would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival			1
the case centered on whether the girl is mature enough to determine how to treat her @entity23 lymphoma , which she was diagnosed with in september			0
several other states recognize the ' mature minor doctrine			0
' @entity9 's chemo resumed on december 17 , with surgery to install a port in her chest that would be used to administer the drugs , after she initially refused the treatment for her @entity23 lymphoma @entity35 , pictured on january 2 , at her home in @entity33 , @entity34 , said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that do n't include the ' poison ' of chemotherapy the court ruled that her lawyers had the opportunity to prove her maturity during a @entity44 in december and failed to do so ' under any standard '			1
the teen , for example , was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in november but instead ran away for a week , according to court documents			1
' @entity9 either intentionally misrepresented her intentions to the trial court or she changed her mind on this issue of life and death , ' chief justice @entity51 said			2
@entity23 ( cells pictured ) is a disease of the white blood cells @entity23 is cancer of the white blood cells called b lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			0
the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			0
@entity72 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			2
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			2
the most common symptom of @entity23 is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			0
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			0
the cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system , taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the @entity104 ( which causes glandular fever )			2
it is n't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it			2
the only way to confirm a diagnosis of @entity23 is by carrying out a biopsy			0
almost all young people with @entity23 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids			1
a more lengthy written decision will come at a later date , she said			2
@entity9 currently is confined in a room at @entity129 in @entity130 , where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy			1
without it , they said there was a near - certainty of death within two years			0
the teen 's mother , @entity35 of @entity33 , said after the arguments on thursday that she would n't allow her daughter to die			1
the single mother said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that do n't include putting the ' poison ' of chemotherapy into her daughter 's body			1
' this is her decision and her rights , which is what we are here fighting about , ' @entity147 said			1
' we should have choices about what to do with our bodies			1
' @entity147 and her lawyer said they are considering their next step after losing the case , but expect to go back to the trial court in an attempt to more fully explore the mature minor argument			0
after @entity9 was diagnosed with high - risk @entity23 lymphoma , she and her mother missed several appointments , prompting doctors at @entity129 to notify the state @entity169 , court documents said			1
the child welfare agency investigated and a trial court granted the agency temporary custody of @entity9			0
lawyers for @entity9 and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but were unsuccessful			1
@entity9 's treatment resumed on december 17 , with surgery to install a port in her chest that would be used to administer the drugs			1
@entity184 began the next day and continues			0
assistant attorney general said @entity9 exhibited the ' magical thinking ' of an immature child , believing that if she ignored the cancer it would go away and using the slang of the day was ' blowing off the severity of her condition '			0
child welfare agency officials defended their treatment of @entity9 , saying they have a responsibility to protect the girl 's life			1
' this is a curable illness , and we will continue to ensure that @entity9 receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult , ' the agency said in a statement			0
@entity9 currently is confined in a room at @entity129 in @entity130 , where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy , which doctors said would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival			2

@entity0 ruled her lawyers had the opportunity to prove her maturity during a @entity44 in december and failed ' under any standard '
the teen was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in november but instead ran away for a week , according to court documents
the teen 's mother , @entity35 , said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that do n't include the ' poison ' of chemotherapy
she said : ' this is her decision and her rights , which is what we are here fighting about . we should have choices about what to do with our bodies '
