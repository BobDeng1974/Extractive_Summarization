by @entity0 in january more than 200 people sent @entity3 video selfies for their ‘ @entity5 ’ campaign			1
this was an international video shout - out to celebrate the end of 31 months of deep - space hibernation for @entity3 ’s @entity5 spacecraft , currently on its way to a comet			1
and now @entity3 plans to send some of the messages into space on a trip out of the solar system			2
scroll down for a video compliation of the selfies @entity3 is sending 10 video selfies into deep space via a transmission from a tracking station in @entity23			1
this will include the entry from @entity26 in @entity27 , pictured , which won the ' @entity5 ' competition with 10,508 votes the endeavour will be carried out by @entity31 , @entity3 ’s 115ft ( 35 metres ) deep - space tracking station at @entity33 , @entity23			1
the station will transmit a 35 - megabyte archive filed with the top 10 video selfies that were were submitted to @entity3 during the @entity5 campaign			1
the message will be broadcast into deep space on 15 may 2015			2
@entity40 is part of @entity3 ’s @entity43 network that is used to send and receive data from spacecraft including @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity5 and @entity48 , the latter of which is currently compiling a 3d catalogue of one billion objects in the @entity52			1
on their website @entity3 says it ’s difficult to know how far the signal will go , ‘ given the low - ish transmit power and the probability of being attenuated to undetectable levels in the future			2
’ travelling at light speed , the signal will pass the moon ’s orbit in one second			0
after four hours it will be beyond @entity65 , and 10 months later it will pass through the @entity67 cloud of comets that surround the sun. in 20,000 years it will leave the @entity52 and , ultimately , in 13.8 billion years it will reach the edge of the observable universe that we can see from @entity74 today			1
1 second signal at distance of the @entity77 ( although the @entity77 will be on the other side of @entity74 ) 5 minutes passing above the ecliptic plane close to @entity80 - the target of @entity3 's 2016 @entity83 mission 21 minutes passing the distance of the main part of the asteroid belt 30 minutes same distance as @entity5 ( which lies in a different direction ) 4 hours now beyond @entity65 , the outermost planet of our @entity90 14 hours travelling through the heliopause , which separates the realm of the solar wind from the local interstellar cloud 10 months passing through the @entity67 cloud of comets that surround the sun 1 year leaving the local interstellar cloud that contains the sun 200 years leaving the local bubble – an interstellar void carved out of the @entity103 arm of the @entity52 within which we reside by a supernova hundreds of million of years ago 300 years leaving behind the @entity103 spur – our branch of the @entity110 spiral arm of our @entity52 galaxy 548 years passing close to @entity113 – a bright star in the constellation of @entity115 1,000 years passing by the @entity116 5,000 years leaving behind the neighbouring @entity115 spiral arm of the @entity52 20,000 years passing the outer fringes of the @entity52 galaxy 2.45 million years same distance as the @entity121 , a neighbour to our @entity52 10 million years leaving the local group of 54 galaxies , of which the @entity52 and @entity121 are members 70 million years leaving the @entity127 , in which the local group is contained 13.8 billion years reaching the edge of the observable @entity130 ( observable from @entity74 as of today ) cebreros station ( @entity132 2 ) , from where the transmission will be made , was inaugurated in 2005 and is the second in @entity3 's 115 - foot ( 35 metres ) trio of deep space stations ; the other two are in @entity139 , @entity140 ( @entity132 1 ) , and @entity141 , @entity142 ( @entity132 3 ) the videos were part of a competition celebrating the end of the @entity148 's 31 - month hibernation on its way to study comet @entity150 ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
the spaececraft will enter orbit around the comet this month and will drop a lander , @entity157 , onto the surface later this year to make the transmission , the station will point directly upwards in what the engineers call the ‘ @entity164 ’ position			0
while the station is capable of transmitting at 20 kilowatts , it will use a two kilowatt amplifier in this case			0
the transmission will start at about 13:40 @entity170 time and will last about three minutes			0
the bit rate , the speed at which data is transferred , will be about 250 kilobits per second			0
although significantly slower than a home internet connection ( which is about 5,000 to 10,000 kilobits per second ) , it is much faster than spacecraft transmission			0
for example , transmission to @entity5 is two kilobits per second , while @entity48 is four kilobits per second			2
@entity3 has invited a group of students from @entity181 ( @entity182 ) @entity183 near @entity184 to help with the event			0
the @entity40 station is situated near @entity187 , @entity23			0
it is one of the world 's most sophisticated and technically advanced tracking stations used for satellite control , and is capable of communicating with missions orbiting as far away as @entity194			0

@entity3 is planning to send ten video selfies from the public into deep space
the videos were submitted as part of their ' @entity5 ' campaign
this was a competition celebrating the end of the spacecraft 's hibernation
the selfies will be part of a @entity213 archive of data sent from @entity33 , @entity23
the signal will reach the edge of the @entity52 galaxy in 20,000 years
