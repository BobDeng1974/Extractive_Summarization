for the first time in recent memory , the sack race is a non-starter			0
those @entity5 bosses who looked a dead cert for the chop at the tail end of the last season have done enough to survive so far			0
@entity10 , wanted out by @entity12 fans for the majority of the past year , has seen a miraculous turnaround at @entity15 , with his happy @entity12 sitting fifth			0
@entity18 , despite a good start to the campaign , has overseen another @entity20 slide but remains in the hot seat and was even given a brand - spanking new four - year deal in september			2
@entity23 was sacked on december 6 , 2010 despite leading @entity24 to the @entity5 @entity18 ( left ) is still under pressure , but @entity26 has recovered well at @entity24 @entity24 fans imploring the club to sack the manager earlier in the season @entity31 at @entity32 hangs on , while @entity26 fought through the calls for his head at the start of the campaign to guide @entity24 to five @entity5 wins in a row			1
@entity38 was sacked as @entity40 boss on february 15 , 1993 ; the longest time between the season starting and a sacking in top flight history if those hanging by a thread keep hold of their jobs by monday , it will be the first time since 1996 that the @entity5 has reached this stage of the season without a sacking			1
@entity23 lost his job at @entity24 , somewhat surprisingly , on december 6 , 2010 , just months after he guided them back to the @entity5 from the second tier			1
a weekend survival would cast memories back 18 years , when @entity57 was axed as @entity59 boss on january 2 , 1996			1
the record for the longest season of bosses clinging on for dear life is 1992 - 93			2
@entity40 held fire until after they exchanged @entity67 gifts with @entity38 before getting rid on february 15 , 1993			2
@entity31 and @entity69 's @entity68 lead the sack race with the bookies , and both will want to get to @entity73 without their @entity74			0
@entity32 sit in 16th place with just three wins all season , and @entity31 's side travel to @entity79 on saturday , with their man at the helm @entity82 also in the danger zone with just one win in 13 games this term			0
newly promoted @entity69 go to @entity20 on sunday , with the fans just starting to turn against @entity68 during the difficult winter period			0
the axe could be about to fall ... 2 - 1 @entity31 3 - 1 @entity68 7 - 1 @entity82 8 - 1 @entity90 8 - 1 @entity18 12 - 1 @entity91 15 - 1 @entity92 20 - 1 @entity93 20 - 1 @entity94 20 - 1 @entity95 25 - 1 @entity96 33 - 1 @entity97 50 - 1 @entity98 50 - 1 @entity26 ( @entity99 courtesy of @entity101 ) could @entity92 be the first high - profile boss to depart the @entity5 @entity32 boss @entity31 has called on fans to show their support rather than booing during games @entity69 manager @entity68 positions himself in the stands , where he is surrounded by supporters			1

if the @entity5 does **n't** have a sacking by monday it will be the longest start to the season without a cull since 1996
@entity23 was sacked on december 6 , 2010 from @entity24
before him , @entity57 was sacked as @entity59 boss on january 2 , 1996
1992 - 93 saw the longest period without a sacking ; @entity38 was **n't** axed by @entity40 until february 15 , 1993
@entity31 , @entity68 and @entity18 are all under pressure
