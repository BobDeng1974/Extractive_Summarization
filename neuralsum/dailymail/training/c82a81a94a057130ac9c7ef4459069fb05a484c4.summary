@entity0 will target @entity1 again next summer after their first bid for the @entity4 star failed			1
the champions were quoted an astonishing £ 50million for @entity1 by @entity6 when they inquired in june , almost double their valuation of the player			1
city manager @entity9 and football director @entity10 were not interested in pursuing a deal at that price			2
however , they still believe @entity1 is a perfect fit for the club and will attempt to re-open talks with @entity6 at the end of the season			1
@entity0 will target @entity1 again next summer after their first bid for the @entity4 star failed city only spent a net £ 9m in the summer and @entity9 knows he has money for transfers			1
he is also a striker short after @entity23 returned to @entity24 for personal reasons , and @entity9 is keen to buy @entity27 players , given that the club do not expect their new academy system to bear fruit for two or three seasons			2
city are aware @entity27 players tend to be hugely overpriced , as @entity35 ’s £ 31m deal for defender @entity36 and @entity38 ’s purchase of @entity39 would seem to illustrate			0
the club have also had their fingers burnt , with major domestic signings @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity44 all failing to live up to expectations			0
however , @entity0 need to ensure their quota of @entity27 players falls within domestic and @entity48 guidelines , and their research into @entity1 ’s lifestyle and temperament have shown him to be exactly what they require			1
@entity6 are sure to resist @entity0 ’s advances but the @entity57 club ’s recent history does show that they will often sell one high - profile player per summer			1
@entity9 ( right , talking to @entity59 ) baulked at the £ 50million quoted by @entity6 for @entity1 @entity60 ( right , embracing @entity61 ) thinks @entity63 's equaliser could be crucial @entity63 scored late on as 10 - man @entity0 drew against @entity65 at the @entity66 @entity0 ’s first - team squad contains two @entity4 internationals in goalkeeper @entity69 and midfielder @entity59			1
both will be offered new deals , with the club playing down suggestions over the weekend that @entity69 ’s future at the @entity66 is in doubt			0
@entity60 believes @entity63 ’s late equaliser against @entity65 on sunday could prove crucial in @entity0 ’s bid to retain the @entity79 title			1
the @entity81 star said : ‘ ever since i ’ve been at this club , seasons and big moments have been decided on small events like this so i will never under - estimate what it could mean to our season			0
‘ he has such quality — the goal he scored is probably something you would have seen for the last 15 years in the @entity79			2
‘ he is so clever , still extremely motivated and he has the experience to keep cool in vital moments			0
‘ we are under pressure , we ’re down to 10 men , how many players would ’ve scored that goal ? that ’s ultimately what you need			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 ’s first - team squad will move into the club ’s new training ground opposite their stadium in just three weeks			2
a source said : ‘ it ’s a jaw - dropping facility			0
probably the best in @entity109			0

@entity9 baulked at the price asked for by @entity6 in the summer
@entity0 are set to go back in for @entity1 next summer
@entity60 thinks @entity63 's equaliser against @entity65 on sunday could prove crucial in the @entity79 title race
