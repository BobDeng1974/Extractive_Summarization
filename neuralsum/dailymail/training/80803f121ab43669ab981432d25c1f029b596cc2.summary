a schoolgirl who went to hospital suffering from headaches was horrified to be told she had a brain tumour the size of an orange			1
doctors discovered the benign tumour inside @entity9 's brain after they realised she had lost sight in her left eye over a matter of months			1
@entity9 , eight , had started getting headaches last year but after an eye test showed no problems a viral infection was put down as the cause			1
hope : @entity9 will fly to @entity18 with her mother @entity19 ( left ) for proton beam therapy , to treat her brain tumour but the headaches came back in february and after visiting the @entity23 with her mother @entity24 , she was referred to the ophthalmic department at @entity26			1
when she had her appointment in july doctors said that unbeknown to @entity9 she had gone blind in her left eye			2
an emergency mri scan revealed an orange - sized tumour in her brain			2
@entity9 was diagnosed with craniopharyngioma , a slow - growing tumour which is normally impossible to remove without causing serious damage			1
she had an operation to shrink the tumour by half around five weeks ago			0
she will travel to @entity38 in @entity18 for a revolutionary treatment called proton beam therapy , which doctors hope will cure the condition			1
however , she will be blind in her left eye for the rest of her life			0
the treatment , which is only available in the @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , is similar to radiotherapy but does not damage the surrounding tissue , and reduces the risk of secondary tumours in later life			1
miss @entity24 from @entity55 , @entity26 , said : ' @entity9 deals with everything remarkably bravely			2
she is the most resilient child i 've ever come across			0
she 's happy , cheerful and takes it all completely in her stride			0
' it 's so hard to describe how we felt			0
i do n't think i 'll ever forget that moment when they sat us down and said : " @entity9 has a brain tumour "			1
but you learn to deal with it day by day			0
' ' remarkably brave ' : @entity9 has already had one brain operation talking about @entity9 prior to the diagnosis , she added : ' we are pretty certain @entity9 's eyesight was fine when she first went to the opticians ( in august 2010 ) and just deteriorated rapidly that year			1
' there was nothing obvious at that point to suggest there was a problem			0
her school teachers or family did n't notice anything			0
when i talked to @entity9 she thought it was no big deal			2
' she had an emergency mri on the monday , and on the wednesday we were called back and informed she had a brain tumour and was being referred to @entity88 for a biopsy and further investigation			1
' the @entity91 is funding the @entity47 treatment , which is being coordinated by the @entity93			1
the health service is also paying @entity9 's and her mother 's travel costs			2
miss @entity24 's employer , the @entity97 , is raising money to help miss @entity24 's partner @entity99 and @entity9 's dad @entity100 to visit her during her treatment			1
miss @entity24 said : ' it 's fantastic			0
i ca n't thank them enough			0
they have really gone above and beyond what we expected anyone to do for us			0
' @entity9 will undergo treatment for two months in @entity47			1
it finishes on december 23 but she will be recovering for two weeks before she is well enough to fly back			0
miss @entity24 added : ' she will have this condition for life			0
essentially there will still be a tumour left in her brain but it wo n't be growing and will be significantly smaller			2
' it has virtually destroyed her pituitary gland and she will be on medication for the rest of her life but she should be able to lead a normal life			0

@entity9 will have a revolutionary treatment in @entity47 to try and remove most of the brain tumour
