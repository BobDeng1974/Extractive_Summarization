@entity1 administration officials told a gathering of all 100 @entity3 on wednesday that they were kept in the dark about saturday 's prisoner swap because the @entity6 warned that they would kill @entity8 sgt. @entity7 if any information about the plan leaked to the public			1
but @entity13 sen. @entity12 , the senior @entity14 member of the @entity15 , says he and @entity17 sen. @entity16 , his @entity18 counterpart on the committee , were told ' months and months ' in advance when the @entity1 administration was planning to kill @entity22			1
' it was like they did n't trust @entity16 and me , ' @entity12 said during an interview on the @entity27 , describing his frustration with being kept out of the loop on the @entity7 hostage swap			1
' and yet the two of us knew about the @entity22 event leading up to the takedown of @entity22 for months and months and months , ' he said			2
yes to the @entity36 raid , no to the @entity6 trade : sen. @entity12 told @entity27 that the @entity1 administration briefed him and other @entity15 leaders about the @entity22 kill raid ' months ' in advance , and there were no public leaks @entity44 killed terror mastermind @entity22 in his @entity47 bedroom in 2011 ; senators were briefed ' months and months ' in advance , @entity12 said so finds it hard to fathom that he was n't trusted with plans for @entity7 's release ( right ) ' it 's just very puzzling about why they did n't notify anyone in @entity56 about what was going on , ' @entity12 added , referring to the negotiations for @entity7 's release			1
@entity44 killed @entity22 , the global leader of the @entity36 terror network , may 2 , 2011 in a covert nighttime raid on his @entity61 , @entity47 compound			2
no information about that operation became public until president @entity1 announced the news in a triumphant @entity66 event			1
the @entity67 first published an account of wednesday 's closed - door @entity15 meeting where lawmakers heard explanations from from the @entity66 about why the @entity1 administration chose to carry out negotiations for @entity7 's safe return in secret			1
deputy national security adviser @entity75 delivered the presentation , according to two @entity15 staffers			1
he told senators that that the administration moved quickly and sought no congressional approval for the release of five @entity6 terrorists from the @entity82 because of the @entity6 's death threat against @entity7 if the deal was n't kept quite			1
a @entity15 @entity14 aide told @entity86 that few on @entity88 believe that rationale			0
' it 's a flimsy argument , ' he said , requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press			0
' we have an intelligence committee that meets in a hermetically sealed room			0
if you ca n't trust them with the most sensitive information about what the @entity66 is up to , we may as well pack it in and become a monarchy			0
' ' it 's just so much bs			0
now we 're all going to wonder even more what the @entity66 is n't telling us			2
' big guns : @entity12 ( @entity106 ) is the @entity15 's vice-chair and ranking @entity14 while @entity18 sen. @entity107 ( r ) chairs the committee ; then secretary of state @entity109 promised both that they would have 30 days ' notice if anyone was transferred out of the @entity114 prisoncamp deputy national security advisor @entity75 briefed all 100 senators on wednesday , citing a @entity6 threat to execute sgt. @entity7 if negotiations were leaked to the public as the reason for a hurried prisoner exchange without putting @entity56 in the loop the @entity27 interview with @entity12 first aired wednesday on @entity125 's evening program , and portions were re-aired thursday afternoon			1
@entity127 asked him if the @entity66 also explained why the @entity15 was n't notified about the 5 - for - 1 hostage trade ' five minutes before it went down			1
' ' i mean , why they did n't pick up the phone at the @entity66 and call you and senator @entity16 ? it would have taken about 30 seconds			2
' @entity12 was on the same page			0
' that was my question to @entity136 [ @entity137 ] , ' he responded			0
' you guys knew this was going down several days out , ' he recalled telling @entity75			2
' why did n't you pick up the phone , particularly since secretary @entity109 had written to senator @entity16 and me and said , " we understand the law is we have to give you 30 days notice before the transfer of any @entity82 detainee			1
we assure you we will give you that notice "			0
' ' my comment back to the administration , ' @entity12 concluded , ' is that i 'm not gon na believe anything they tell me from now on			0
... ' how in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us ? ' another @entity14 , @entity155 sen. @entity154 , demanded thursday that @entity156 tell @entity157 counseled the @entity66 to move ahead with the @entity6 trade in the absence of congressional input			2
' unfortunately , this is the latest instance in which the president has chosen to act unilaterally , without regard for @entity56 â€™s role , and contrary to a law he recently signed , ' @entity154 wrote to attorney general @entity166			0
@entity1 signed the annual @entity168 authorization bill in december , which included the 30 - day congressional notification requirement			0
' the public deserves a full and transparent accounting of why the @entity172 believed it could disregard the law , ' @entity154 insisted .			0

@entity13 sen. @entity12 said he did n't believe the @entity1 administration 's claim that fear of a leak prompted them to finalize the release of five terrorists from @entity82 without telling @entity56
@entity12 said he and @entity15 chair @entity16 ' knew about ... the takedown of [ @entity22 ] @entity22 for months and months and months '
nothing about the @entity22 kill raid was made public until president @entity1 announced at the @entity66 that the @entity36 leader was dead
deputy national security adviser @entity75 told senators on wednesday that the @entity6 *threatened* to execute @entity8 sgt. @entity7 if any news leaked about hostage - swap negotiations
that explanation , he said , *justified* ignoring a law that requires the @entity66 to tell @entity56 30 days before releasing anyone from @entity82
