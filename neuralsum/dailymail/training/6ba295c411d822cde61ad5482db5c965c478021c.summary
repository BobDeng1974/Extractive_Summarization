belligerent @entity0 was reported yesterday to have launched a refurbished @entity2 - era submarine , capable of firing ballistic missiles that could easily reach its enemy neighbour , @entity6 - and far beyond			1
military and government sources in @entity9 were quoted by @entity6 ’s @entity11 news agency as saying that the development raises further concerns about the @entity0 ’s evolving missile and nuclear threats			1
the disturbing news comes as photos were released of unpredictable leader @entity19 visiting a @entity0 air force base where , the official @entity22 newspaper reported , he checked out equipment on a fighter jet and ‘ gave instructions ’ to pilots			1
he even promoted four squadron leaders on the spot			0
news of @entity19 ’s visit prompted a @entity6 source to remark that the @entity0 ’s pilots have little experience in air battles and are ‘ seized with fear ’ at the thought of taking on @entity9 ’s airmen who have access to far superior technology			1
whether @entity19 ’s visit - his ninth to air force units this year - and the launching of the nuclear - capable submarine was just ‘ sabre - rattling ’ or a severe warning of troubles ahead was not immediate apparent			1
but the work on the 1958 @entity2 vessel to bring it up to standards capable of putting to sea and possibly firing ballistic weapons is being watched carefully by @entity6 ’s military			2
@entity19 congratulated the pilots for their skills			2
he even promoted four squadron leaders on the spot the ‘ new ’ submarine , which was decommissioned by the @entity71 in 1990 , is said to be 67 meters long with a beam of 6.6 meters			0
the 3,500 - ton @entity74 class submarine carries the @entity76 liquid - propellant missile with a 1,180 kilogram warhead and a maximum range of 1,420 kilometres			0
news of the @entity0 ’s submarine first emerged last month in a report by the @entity82 at the @entity83 in the @entity84			1
another source was quoted by the @entity11 today as saying that in a move to mount a missile tube on the refurbished submarine , @entity0 has carried out dozens of tests on the ground and at sea			0
‘ according to the analysis of satellite imagery … a ground test facility for the @entity97 ( submarine - launched ballistic missile ) launch has been up and running at the @entity100 shipyard , ’ said the source			0
the source added that a dozen more tests would be required to perfect the technology			0
the source ’s comments are said to be in line with what arms expert @entity106 said in a recent report that @entity0 had built a ‘ new test stand ’ at its secret @entity100 shipyard to research and develop @entity97			1
that test stand has a 35 - by - 30 meter concrete pad and stands about 12 meters high			0
‘ it would take one or two years before the @entity0 completes the test for the vertical launch of missiles from the sea , ’ a military source in @entity9 said today			2
the communist regime has more submarines than @entity6 , but they are equipped with outdated weapons .			0
