i had a good feeling about my home grand prix at @entity4 because obviously we have had a fast car this season			1
the big question was whether any of our rivals would get closer to us , and while that was the case , we were still absolutely dominant and that was fantastic for the team			1
the result of qualifying was hugely important because it is vital to start from pole around the tight streets of @entity17			1
of course , there was an issue where i left the track in my final run which brought out the yellow flags			2
i made a mistake , went off the road , and then i found out they wanted to investigate the incident to see if i had done it on purpose			2
so , that was quite awkward , and i did n't see it coming			1
it was clear by looking at the data that every thing i 'd done on the lap in question had been very similar to my previous laps			1
it was obvious that i had done nothing on purpose			2
the running order during qualifying is taken in turns between myself and @entity59 at each weekend – one weekend i choose whether i run first or second on the road , the next weekend it 's @entity59			1
in @entity4 , it was actually my engineer who made the call because i did n't answer when he asked me			1
so he took the decision , determined what was best for us and so i went out first			2
starting from pole was obviously the best place to be in @entity4 , and we got a great getaway for once			1
we have worked a lot on our starts because it was a weakness , but we have made great progress on that which is hugely important for the remainder of the season			1
from then on in it was vital to control the tyres and the pace of the race			2
my team - mate was always directly behind me applying as much pressure as he could to try and force me into a mistake			2
so , it was not an easy grand prix with him right behind me the whole time			2
toe - to - toe : @entity31 finished second behind his @entity89 team - mate in @entity4 i made sure i did not wear out the tyres because that was the one thing that could have caught me out , and by the end of the race i had really good pace and managed to pull away from @entity59 to get a clear gap and win the grand prix which was a fantastic experience			1
to win in @entity4 for the second time in as many seasons was unreal			1
so , we had a great party , at several locations , in the evening			1
we started on the beach and then i went for dinner with @entity104 which was a very special experience			0
obviously , that sort of thing does n't happen every day , and being a local resident in @entity4 made it even more special			1
i made a speech in front of everybody and there were huge fireworks display which they announced in my honour ; all of which was pretty crazy			0
we then carried on the party with all of my friends so that was awesome and we all had a great time			1
@entity121 moment : @entity32 celebrates his second victory in as many years at the @entity124 i am quite neutral about my relationship with @entity31			0
it is always going to be the case that you have some difficult times which will be followed by good times			1
our strength is that we always talk about what has happened and go through things as we did when we were both 14			1
it is always going to be like that , and indeed it continues to be like that			0
@entity59 issued a tweet last week commenting on our friendship , and that we 'd spoken			1
i do n't want to go into that detail of what was said , but be sure that when there are difficult moments we discuss them and move on , so there is nothing out of the ordinary in any way			1
old friends : @entity32 and @entity31 have played down the intensity of their rivalry for this year 's championship on the tuesday after my win in @entity4 we went to @entity155 's @entity154 training base , and there was a very serious incident where two people got injured			1
for everybody involved it was an extremely shocking experience			0
since then , we have been trying to take care of the people who were injured together with @entity89 and the @entity155 national team as much as possible			0
i do n't want to go into too much detail about what happened because i want to maintain my full focus on the race weekend in @entity168			2
shock : two people were injured in a serious collision involving @entity32 after he 'd been to the @entity155 camp this week is the @entity168 @entity124 , and @entity172 is the highest fuel consumption track of the year and the most difficult to get to the end of the race within the 100kilogram limit			2
that is something that we must pay attention to			0
i have worked on it during the simulator and it is all under control			0
that will be one of the main challenges of the weekend			0
i arrived into @entity172 on wednesday and we had a couple of nice commitments straight away in the evening			0
the first was a charity appearance for the @entity191 and @entity192 here in @entity172			0
the foundation is collecting money to help finance @entity196 and make it sustainable			0
today , one child in 2,700 suffers from congenital hypothyroidism			0
this is one too many			0
then later on , we had a massive team dinner on wednesday night which was always good			0
the whole team booked out a steak restaurant for everybody which was awesome			0
it is always great to get some private time and share some time with them , so we could relax a little bit and talk with all the guys who work so hard at the race weekends			1
we are in the middle of the most incredible roll right now and making history for @entity89 each weekend			0
but everybody in the team knows that being successful depends on getting every detail right			0
one of those details is the team spirit and we are enjoying our success but also working hard to keep our feet on the ground			0
we are six races into the season and there is still a very long way to go … @entity32 's fee for his column will be donated to the @entity227 , which is dedicated to providing help to former and current @entity230 mechanics and their families , putting @entity230 mechanics throughout the world in touch with each other and raising funds to help in times of need			2
you can follow @entity32 on @entity240 @ nico_rosberg and @entity89 @ @entity241			0

it is always going to be the case that i will have difficult times with @entity59
but our strength is we discuss what has happened and move on
i was *surprised* to be called to the stewards in @entity4 - it was awkward
it was clear that i had done nothing *wrong* on my way to securing pole
winning in @entity4 for a second time was unreal and we had a great party
