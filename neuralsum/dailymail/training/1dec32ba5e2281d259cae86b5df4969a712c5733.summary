however , sir @entity0 struggled to live up to his military achievements in his private life , which is riddled with scandal			1
when money was tight sir @entity0 resorted to selling ' slightly forged ' ancient slingshots taken from @entity113 to raise much - needed cash , along with several other ' scams ' , according to archives of his work			0
