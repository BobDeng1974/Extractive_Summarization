the family of a severely disabled teenager who has the mental age of a five - year - old were left furious after benefits officers demanded the girl be put through a fitness - to - work assessment			0
@entity7 , 19 , suffers from the extremely rare genetic disorder called @entity9 , which means she is unable to eat , sleep or walk without the help of mother @entity12			1
in preparation for @entity7 leaving her special needs school , her mother and her full - time carer applied for employment support allowance ( @entity18 ) to replace their child benefit payments			1
but the family were shocked to be told @entity7 would need to be tested to rule out her being fit for work - a process @entity24 branded ' bureaucracy gone mad '			1
now , since reports of @entity7 's situation came to light , the @entity26 have said she is no longer required to do a @entity30			1
@entity31 is angry that her daughter @entity7 - who has a mental age of five and can not walk or eat without help - has been told she will have to undergo a fitness - to - work assessment the family , from @entity37 , @entity38 , hit out the government 's refusal to realise that @entity7 , who can not read or write and needs around the clock care , is entirely unfit to work			1
they had been told they would have to wait up to a year to receive medical tests , in which time they would have missed out on around £ 200 a month they were entitled to			2
miss @entity7 , 42 , said : ' @entity7 is completely reliant on us - she is unable to do anything for herself and has been in care from birth			2
' two weeks before she left her special needs school we applied for employment support allowance as we would no longer be receiving child benefit			1
' they told us she would have to have another screening process to rule out she is unfit for work - even though the doctor has sent a note to show how disabled she is			0
' we filled this form out asking what @entity7 could and could n't do			2
it was a joke - just crosses in every box			0
@entity7 ca n't read , write , talk or even sleep without help			2
' the teenager , who turns 20 next month , was born with part of a chromosome missing and has to be sedated each night due to the part of her brain which induces sleep being disabled			0
she also lives with one kidney - meaning she is prone to frequent infections - as well as bowel and bladder paralysis and 70 per cent curvature of her spine			0
@entity7 , now 19 , has an extremely rare genetic disorder which has left parts of her brain disabled miss @entity7 applied for support for when @entity7 leaves special school and was shocked to hear of the test miss @entity7 , who lives with partner @entity82 , 38 , and @entity7 's younger sister @entity83 , seven , and ten - year - old brother @entity84 , added : ' the system is too bureaucratic and it sees us as figures instead of people			1
' surely anyone can see @entity7 will never be able to be independent , let alone work			0
i know they only want to check to avoid fraud , but if you look fraud only accounts for one per cent of disability allowances			0
' speaking before the @entity26 decided not to make @entity7 take the test , miss @entity7 said : ' it 's a standard case of " computer says no " and it 's made things really difficult			1
' it 's a waste of public money and a drain on the @entity104 - they know of @entity7 's condition but will now have to conduct a series of degrading tests on her for the sake of proving what we all already know			0
' the family receives £ 310 every four weeks for disability living allowance and £ 141 every fortnight for employment support allowance			0
the family say @entity7 will continue to go to her day care centre after she finishes at her special school			1
a @entity26 spokesman said earlier today : ' no - one should doubt our commitment to ensuring that people who need an assessment get the best possible service and are seen in the quickest possible time			0
' but following reports of @entity7 's situation they released a new statement , saying @entity7 would not have to take the test			2
a spokesman said : ' miss @entity7 is not required to do a @entity30 and she has been put in the support group of @entity18			1
' she has also been paid arrears of £ 244.98			0
' miss @entity7 says it should be clear to anyone that her daughter can not work and has branded the demand she undergo the assessment ' bureaucracy gone mad '			2

@entity7 can not eat or walk alone due to a rare genetic disorder
her mother applied for support ahead of her finishing special school
but she was shocked to be told the teenager would have to undergo test
they *feared* she *'ll* miss out on help in the months she now has to wait
following outrage the @entity26 now say @entity7 does not have to take the test
