@entity0 's @entity143 - printed experimental dress crowned at the collar with robotic spider legs			1
the legs move when somebody invades the wearer 's personal space , or they become stressed			0
the dress rises when the wearer is stressed out ( right ) but returns to normal ( left ) when they calm down @entity0 's @entity143 printed dress in action - the dress can sense the wearer 's mood it is not @entity0 's first move into arachnid - based systems			1
earlier this year the chip giant showed off a tablet that can use hand gestures to scroll a recipe , drones that can manoeuvre an obstacle course without human intervention and even smart clothing that can help the visually impaired navigate safely - and a smart cocktail dress that can repel people who invade the wearer 's space			1
@entity0 ceo @entity6 also used the keynote at the @entity176 show in @entity177 to show off the company 's @entity179 technology for seeing and understanding depth			1
' the rise of new personal computing experiences , intelligent and connected devices , and the wearable revolution are redefining the relationship between consumers and technology , ' he said			0
@entity0 also showed off experimental designer @entity190 's latest @entity189			1

' i 'm showing how fashion can be thought provoking , something that pushes people to think and share their feelings			1
@entity143 - printed experimental dress crowned at the collar with robotic spider legs which move			1
' @entity204 acts as the interface between the body and the external world , ' said @entity190			0
' it uses technology and the garment as a medium of interaction			0
' the so - called animatronic arachnid limbs on the @entity204 know exactly when someone is invading the wearer 's personal space			0
the legs are driven by computer and sensor technologies that allow it to be autonomous , but assistive and adaptive to the owner 's emotions and desires			2
' since the system based with mechanic spider legs is literally hosted on the shoulders of the wearer and attacks using the same viewing angle as the wearer , the system knows how you feel and adapts to those feelings , ' she said			0
