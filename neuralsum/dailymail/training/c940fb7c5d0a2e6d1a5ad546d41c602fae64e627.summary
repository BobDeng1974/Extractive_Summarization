earlier this week astronomers made the groundbreaking announcement that they had found eight new habitable planets using the kepler space telescope - bringing its total up to 1,000			1
but will we ever have a chance to glimpse these planets in greater detail , either by telescope or perhaps by visiting them in the future ? according to one of @entity14 's top planet hunters , we will find a planet with oceans like @entity17 in the next 15 years - but visiting one would require us to overcome @entity19 's law of special relativity			1
dr @entity21 from @entity14 's @entity22 in @entity23 explained how the upcoming @entity24 could find planets with oceans on them ( illustrated )			1
the giant tennis court - sized telescope will be used to scour the universe			1
his full interview appears in issue 34 of @entity34 dr @entity21 is an astrophysicist at the @entity22 in @entity23 , and the senior project scientist on the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
the giant telescope will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe , figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed			2
but perhaps most excitingly , it will study @entity17 - like worlds beyond our solar system			1
‘ we hope to find a planet that ’s @entity17 - like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean , ’ he said in an interview with @entity48			1
dr @entity21 's interview appears in the latest edition of @entity56 , issue 34 ( shown ) , which is on sale now ‘ i think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now			1
‘ in that time we might be able to say : “ i can see that star over there			0
[ its planet ] has a climate that ’s like @entity17 and it might have life on it			2
” ’ while observing distant worlds is all well and good , actually visiting one at some point in the future poses somewhat of a challenge			0
and it ’s something that dr @entity21 thinks might be too much for us even with the help of artificial intelligence			1
to have any hope , one thing that will be important will be ‘ defeating @entity19 ’ - namely , finding a way to overcome the limitations of light speed and space - time - or enlisting the help of robots			1
according to @entity19 's theory of special relativity , nothing can travel faster than light - making interstellar travel all but impossible for humans			1
‘ we ’re very fragile , ’ said dr @entity21			1
‘ we ’re not going to be able to travel in person very far without a lot of help			0
‘ i think robots are coming along very quickly			0
i believe robotic intelligence will come and we ’ll have to decide whether we like them or not			0
‘ if they ’re smart enough , then they can tell us what to do and where to go just as they did in the movie @entity101			0
‘ however , i think it ’s also possible that we ’re going to defeat @entity19 and that it will still be too far for us to go to another solar system			1
‘ it ’s not impossible but it ’s pretty hard			0
that ’s what i think			0
’ the giant @entity24 will be used to find the first bright objects that formed in the universe , figure out how galaxies evolved and find out how stars formed ( left )			2
dr @entity21 ( right ) also said that in ten to 15 years ' we hope to find a planet that ’s @entity17 - like and measure its atmosphere ' to see if it has oceans on it the @entity24 is the successor to @entity14 's @entity119 and will launch in 2018			1
it is the size of a tennis court and will be launched in a compact form before unfolding in space			2
shown here is a full - scale mock - up of what it will look like when it unfolds the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) will be a large infrared telescope with a 6.5 - meter ( 21ft ) primary mirror			2
it is named after astronomer @entity24 , who was the effective administrator for @entity14 from 1961 through to 1968			2
he is widely heralded with persuading president @entity131 to fund the @entity133 missions to the moon			0
the project is working to a 2018 launch date			0
it is a collaboration between @entity14 , @entity138 and the @entity140 space agency			0
the @entity24 will be the premier observatory of the next decade , serving thousands of astronomers worldwide			2
it will study every phase in the history of our universe , ranging from the first luminous glows after the @entity148 , to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like @entity17 , to the evolution of our own solar system			2
but while travel to one of these distant worlds might be somewhat of an impossibility for now , dr @entity21 is optimistic when it comes to the chances of finding life elsewhere			1
‘ how life came to evolve on our planet is strong evidence that life can evolve elsewhere in the universe , ’ he said			0
‘ intelligent life - that ’s us - has only really turned up quite recently			0
we ourselves are made out of star material			0
‘ stars that explode send chemical material into space			0
some of it is recycled and some of it travels outside of our galaxy to make the next generation of stars that could have planets - worlds that could be like @entity17			1
‘ so that ’s the idea : stars explode and make future generations of stars and planets			0
’ finding out if we are not alone in the universe - or at least detecting tantalising hints that we are not - will be one of the primary goals of the @entity24			1
it will also be used to scour the universe , just like the @entity119 , and with the ability to take images in visible light it will no doubt return fascinating vistas back to @entity17			2
each of the 18 hexagonal - shaped mirror segments on the @entity24 ( shown ) is 4.3ft ( 1.32m ) in diameter			0
the giant telescope will be the powerful space telescope ever launched			0
it will be in an orbit about 930,000 miles ( 1.5 million kilometres ) from @entity17 to get the best views of the universe earlier this week astronomers revealed eight new planets had been discovered in the ' @entity208 ' zone of their stars , orbiting at a distance where oceans and life could exist			1
the discovery doubles the number of small planets less than twice the diameter of @entity17 which are believed to be in the habitable zone of their parent stars			2
among these eight , astronomers say there are two that are the most similar to @entity17 of any known exoplanets to date			0
the two most @entity17 - like planets , known as @entity225 - 438b and @entity225 - 442b , both orbit red dwarf stars that are smaller and cooler than the sun. they have a 70 per cent and 60 per cent chance of being rocky , respectively			1
its design , though , is radically different from that of @entity119			0
the @entity24 ‘ does n’t look like a standard telescope in a tube , ’ dr @entity21 explained			1
instead , it will be a vast array of 18 hexagonal gold mirrors stitched together , which unfold after launch , to afford it our best ever view of the universe			0
together with its vast sunshield , which prevents light from the sun ruining its optics , it is about the size of a tennis court			2
thousands of astronomers will use data from the telescope after it launches in 2018 atop an @entity253 rocket			0
' we ’re doing this for the whole of humanity and 10,000 future users of the telescope , ' explained dr @entity21			1
and many of those will be waiting with bated breath to find out if it can reveal fascinating new insights about potentially @entity17 - like worlds in other planetary systems .			1

dr @entity21 from @entity14 's @entity22 in @entity23 said the upcoming @entity24 could find habitable planets
the giant tennis court - sized telescope will be used to scour the universe
one of its key goals will be to observe worlds in other systems
in ten to 15 years dr @entity21 says we could find a planet with oceans
but he says the only way to visit one would be to ' defeat @entity19 '
this would mean finding a way to travel faster than the speed of light
earlier this week astronomers announced they had found eight new potentially habitable planets - and two are the most @entity17 - like ever
