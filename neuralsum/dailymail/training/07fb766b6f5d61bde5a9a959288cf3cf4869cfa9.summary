i ’m trying to keep my anger in check so let ’s start with the positive			0
@entity4 , the world ’s no 1 golfer , is on the shortlist and deserves to be after a sensational season			1
@entity8 is on it too after exploiting to the full a technically outstanding car to complete a brilliant series of drives which took him to the @entity15 championship			2
they are joined by @entity17 , the mother of two who , aged nearly 41 , pulled a beautifully executed tactical race to win the 10,000 metres at athletics ’ @entity21 in @entity22			0
her triumph in august made her the oldest female to win a gold medal in the history of the championships			0
@entity29 fractured his cheekbone a minute into the @entity32 final in october , but played on to the end @entity29 thunders into the @entity35 defence with his first touch of a rugby ball in union for @entity39 the @entity41 legend will make his first start for @entity39 at inside centre against @entity44 on saturday what a story – so good , in fact , that @entity17 , along with @entity4 and @entity8 , have been rightly recognised as proper candidates for the @entity49 award which will be announced on @entity50 on sunday evening			1
but as for the remaining seven on the shortlist – do me a favour ! i just ca n’t believe that one of sport ’s outstanding players ca n’t even make the top 10			0
i ’m talking about @entity29 , rugby league player supreme and now , having decided to switch codes , destined to be a major figure if @entity59 are to have any chance of winning rugby union ’s @entity61 next year			1
golf star @entity66 ( left ) and @entity65 hero @entity8 have both made the shortlist @entity8 ( @entity15 ) @entity4 ( @entity68 ) @entity69 ( @entity70 ) @entity71 ( @entity72 ) @entity73 ( @entity74 ) @entity75 ( @entity72 ) @entity76 ( @entity77 ) @entity78 ( @entity79 ) @entity80 ( @entity81 ) @entity82 ( skeleton racing ) @entity17 ( running ) i know @entity29 has been playing in @entity85 for four years and only recently returned to this country by signing for @entity39			1
but he was an awesome teenager for @entity87 and made his international debut when only 19			0
@entity41 recognised @entity29 ’s supreme talents and co-owner and acting superstar @entity91 persuaded @entity29 to choose his club as the battle to secure his signature hotted up			1
he had an outstanding four years for the @entity41 and earned a reputation as teak tough , a no - nonsense forward whose ball handling skills put him up there with the best sportsmen and women in the world			2
his final game in @entity85 makes him a sporting icon , a legend , a hero all rolled into one			0
for those unfamiliar with this instance of sporting greatness , a little recap			0
the @entity41 played @entity112 in the 2014 @entity113 and in the very first tackle of the game @entity29 fractured a cheekbone and an eye socket			1
@entity41 owner @entity91 ( left ) brought @entity29 to play rugby league in @entity41 four years ago despite the pain , @entity29 in an extreme act of selflessness played on , not wanting to let his team - mates down			1
he was in supreme form in the game , which his side won , and he was awarded the @entity126 for best player in the grand final - the first @entity41 player to claim the medal in 43 years			2
@entity29 has also made the shortlist for the coveted @entity131			2
the award is given to the player deemed to have been the best in the world that season			0
@entity29 could become the third @entity138 player to receive the award since it was restarted in 1999 , following in the footsteps of @entity140 ( 2012 ) and @entity141 ( 2004 )			0
what more does a player have to do get his talent recognised in his home country ? i simply can not believe that the panel that compiled the shortlist — including olympians @entity149 and @entity150 , @entity151 and footballer @entity152 ( quite how he ranks with the first three goodness only knows ! ) plus @entity50 bigwigs i ’ve never heard of — can ignore one of the great @entity138 sporting heroes			0
@entity29 celebrates the @entity41 ' first @entity113 win in 43 years with team - mate @entity158 so when the @entity159 are sitting by their televisions on sunday evening and the counts come in for the shortlist also - rans like dressage ’s @entity69 ( unless the horsey brigade get behind her ! ) , breaststroke swimmer @entity78 and boxer @entity73 , spare a thought for one man whose talent has been totally ignored			1
how can it possibly be @entity49 when the one sportsman who oozes bravery and talent in equal measure does n’t even make the shortlist ? stand up , @entity29 — you ’re my @entity49 winner ! the shortlist compilers and the @entity159 do n’t have a clue .			1
