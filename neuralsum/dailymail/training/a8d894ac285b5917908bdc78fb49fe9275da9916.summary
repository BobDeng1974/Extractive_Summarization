@entity1 's top female criminal prosecutor , @entity0 , has told a court corruption body @entity2 has no business investigating her private life			1
ms @entity0 launched an urgent action in the @entity7 this morning against the @entity2 claims , which claims she perverted the course of justice and instructed her son 's girlfriend , 25 - year - old @entity11 to fake chest pains to beat a drink driving test in may this year			1
ms @entity0 , who is a familiar figure in @entity17 courts on the bench prosecuting gang rapists and murderers , is the principal plaintiff in today 's court action along with her son , @entity22 , 26 and his 25 - year - old girlfriend , @entity11			1
he said neither ms @entity0 nor any other public official including ' dog catchers and rangers ' should lose their rights as private citizens			1
he said ms @entity63 's role as deputy senior crown prosecutor was ' irrelevant ' in the case of the car crash investigation			2
' you have a state body making a decision impacting on the rights of citizens , ' he said			0
seeking documents : @entity0 , @entity27 , will be on the other side of the court room today when she seeks documents tracing the origin of the ' malicious complaint ' which may have landed her before @entity2 since the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) launched action against ms @entity0 last week , the widely respected @entity78 deputy senior crown prosecutor has received a groundswell of support from senior figures in the @entity1 legal fraternity			1
the @entity2 hearing to investigate allegations of perverting the course of justice against ms @entity0 is due to begin next monday			1
the action , which has been described as a ' witch hunt ' , could ' only be the result of a malicious complaint ' , the 55 - year - old mother of three sons told @entity94			2
ms @entity0 launched her @entity7 action on tuesday to challenge the @entity2 's power to investigate the claim , and to seek documents and a copy of the ' allegation or complaint ' which set off the @entity103 's investigation into ms @entity0 , her son and ms @entity11			1
mr @entity45 asked justice @entity105 to eject @entity2 from an active presence in the court proceedings , arguing it ' endangers the impartiality ' of the @entity103 to rule in the looming hearing against ms @entity0			1
' if the @entity103 becomes the protagonist it endangers their impartiality in subsequent hearings , ' mr @entity45 said			0
he said ms @entity0 and her fellow applicants were demanding @entity2 's reasons for mounting the investigation in the first place			1
' they do n't have any get out of jail free card , ' he said , ' they are accountable like anybody else			0
' but counsel for @entity2 , mr @entity123 , said the @entity103 would resist explaining in court as to why the charges of perverting the course of justice had been laid			0
mr @entity45 is seeking an order restraining the @entity2 from taking further steps in relation to the investigation , the reasons why the action was taken , and a declaration that the commission is acting outside its jurisdiction			0
the car crash at the centre of the @entity2 claims happened on may 31 , when ms @entity11 , 25 , was driving ms @entity0 's @entity140 and she was hit by another vehicle in @entity142 , on @entity17 's north shore			1
the @entity140 was knocked onto its side and ms @entity11 was trapped in her seat belt for some time			0
@entity94 understands once ms @entity11 was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend mr @entity22 , who called his father @entity149			2
mr @entity22 snr then told ms @entity0			2
ms @entity11 , who has breast implants , reported experiencing chest pain at the scene			0
there was some fear the implants may have ruptured			0
the two @entity157 arrived at the accident scene on foot			0
by the time ms @entity0 arrived by car ms @entity11 was in an ambulance			2
she was taken to @entity162 where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system			0
ms @entity11 was not at fault in the accident			0
@entity94 has revealed that @entity2 investigators seized the mobile telephones of ms @entity0 , mr @entity22 and ms @entity11 in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident , on july 30			1
until that day , none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash , which happened in may			0
mr @entity22 and ms @entity11 were subsequently called to private @entity2 hearings in august			1
since @entity2 launched its action , there has been an outcry from legal figures including former @entity184 cabinet head , professor @entity183 , that the matter should have been investigated by police			0
justice @entity105 has previously ruled against @entity0 , in 2007 when she was prosecuting in the retrial of convicted gang rapist @entity189			0
one of three judges on the @entity192 , @entity190 ruled ms @entity0 should not participate in the retrial because she had made public statements about the case of @entity189 and his fellow gang rapists which would compromise ' appropriate fairness and detachment '			2
in a separate action , the acting inspector of the @entity2 , prominent former @entity7 judge @entity199 , @entity46 , announced he was conducting an audit into the @entity103 's action against ms @entity0			1
