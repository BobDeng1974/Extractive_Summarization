by @entity0 a @entity2 spy caught selling @entity4 battle plans while working at a @entity6 base has been jailed for seven years for plunging western security into danger			1
@entity9 - who hid most of his £ 5million loot in bank accounts in @entity12 and @entity13 - was a civilian worker at the vast @entity14 in western @entity2 when he was caught in june last year with usb sticks and top secret plans of @entity4 land and air operations on his computer			1
he also had secret passwords for computer programmes intended for military top brass only			2
it is described as ' grade a ’ material that the @entity28 @entity27 secret service paid him handsomely for			1
spy game : @entity9 worked at @entity14 when he was caught with top secret plans of @entity4 land and air operations on his computer @entity4 had to rebuild its global military strategy plans ‘ from scratch ’ after routine security checks unearthed his spying , which had gone on for many years			1
police and intelligence officers traced the bank accounts to @entity12 and @entity13 where they were held under false names , and the money has been frozen			0
but the damage to @entity6 planning had , in the words of one official , ‘ been immeasurable			0
’ ‘ we are talking names , codes to top secret operational files , the planning of black ops , the targeting of enemy strongholds , tactical land missions everywhere - it is the whole shooting match , not just in @entity56 but across the world , ’ said one @entity6 official			1
@entity9 , 61 , was portrayed in court as an embittered man who grew disillusioned with his meagre pay and status and so began collating the material for his ‘ pension			2
’ the stolen material was retrieved from his home in the village of @entity67 near @entity68 after he left the employ of the @entity4 after a row			2
similar plans : @entity73 @entity72 , former technical assistant for the @entity74 , revealed details of top - secret surveillance conducted by the @entity4 ' @entity77 ‘ the disclosure of the files would have allowed a potential enemy of @entity6 to gain access to the secret network of @entity6 , ’ the court in @entity79 found			1
it rejected the man 's claim that he had wanted to point out security gaps when he copied the data and hid it on usb memory sticks in his kitchen and basement last year			0
@entity9 , an it expert , had worked for @entity6 for more than 30 years			1
he copied the data in march 2012 and failed in an attempt to obtain more in june but left @entity6 shortly afterward			0
the data were the ‘ crown jewels ’ and ‘ operative heart ’ of the system and would have allowed a foreign power to launch a cyber-attack with ‘ devastating impact ’ , said presiding judge @entity103			0
the defendant had earlier denied the charge , saying : ‘ i was never a traitor			0
i am not and never was an enemy of @entity6 , only of the security sloppiness of employees			0
’ the sentence for treasonable espionage was only slightly milder than the seven and a half years that prosecutors had sought .			0

@entity9 was paid £ 5m by the @entity28 @entity27 secret service
caught with top secret plans of @entity4 operations on his computer
