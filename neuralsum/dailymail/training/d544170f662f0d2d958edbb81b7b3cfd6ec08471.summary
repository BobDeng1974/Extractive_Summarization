according to the children 's rhyme , beans are the musical fruit - but now you can turn any food and household item into an instrument thanks to @entity8			1
@entity9 , from @entity11 - based designers @entity12 , is a small synthesiser that lets people build instruments out of everyday , inanimate objects including pipes , cardboard boxes and other junk items			1
alternatively , users can connect it to fruit , vegetables and other conductive items to turn these objects into keys that play music when touched			1
a demonstration video shows the designers getting sounds from an aubergine , pictured left keys : 12 key capacitive touch keyboard ( 1 octave ) with connectors sensors : four sensor inputs , @entity47 analog input audio : built - in speaker and 3.5mm headphone output power : powered by 2 x aa batteries or micro usb memory : 128 @entity55 extras : seven sensors including @entity58 , @entity59 each @entity8 has 12 touch inputs , similar to those found on a keyboard , as well as a built - in speaker and headphone port			1
it can be powered by battery , or by usb			2
there are four sensors that let users modify the sounds produced when the keys are pressed			1
to turn an object into an instrument , users can plug crocodile clips to the object – the demonstration video uses an aubergine – and on the @entity8			1
with conductive items , pressing the object produces the sound			2
' using different combinations of objects and sounds , the only limit is your imagination , ’ said the inventors			0
full video commissioned by @entity89 , a programme ran by @entity90 in @entity91			0
as well as standard items , any conductive object , including fruit and vegetables can be fitted to the @entity8 to create an edible keyboard , like the one pictured each @entity8 , pictured , has 12 touch inputs , similar to those found on a keyboard , as well as a built - in speaker and headphone output			1
it can be powered by battery , or by usb			0
there are four sensor inputs that let users modify the sounds produced when the keys are pressed @entity12 has also created seven different sensors that can be fitted to the board to create different sounds			1
these include the rotation sensor , a potentiometer which can be turned to change the sound , and a light dependent resistor which changes the sound according to the amount of light it receives			0
the @entity121 sensors let users slide their finger across them to change the sound , while the force sensor changes sound depending on the amount of pressure applied to it			0
to turn an object into an instrument , users connect the @entity8 to the item using crocodile clips			2
this can include plant pots , balloons , drainpipes , carboard boxes , and more , pictured here @entity12 has also created seven different sensors that can be fitted to the board to create different sounds			2
this includes sensors controlled by light , touch and force			0
the breath sensor , pictured , changes the sound when someone blows into it , and could be used to make a saxophone - style instrument for example the breath sensor changes the sound when someone blows into it , and could be used to make a saxophone - style instrument for example			0
and finally , the joystick sensor looks like the analog stick on a gamepad and users can move it around to control two sounds at once			0
@entity12 has set up a @entity164 campaign to raise £ 50,000 for the development of @entity8			2
the campaign ends on 2 march and the company has , so far , raised £ 13,500			0
if funded , the @entity8 will go on sale in june for around £ 45 @entity12 has set up a @entity164 campaign to raise £ 50,000 for the development of @entity8			1

the @entity8 synthesiser was designed by @entity11 - based firm @entity12
it can be fitted to inanimate objects to turn them into a musical instrument
users can also make music by connecting conductive items such as fruit
sensors are used to control the different sounds produced by @entity8
each @entity8 is powered by battery or usb and comes with a built - in speaker
the @entity8 is *due* to be *shipped* in june this year and will cost £ 45
