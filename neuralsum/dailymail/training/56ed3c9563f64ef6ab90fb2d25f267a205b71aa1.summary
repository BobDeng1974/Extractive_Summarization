finding grubs in your dinner wo n't be cause for complaint in a new @entity6 restaurant			2
chef @entity8 's @entity7 is set to open in @entity9 , @entity10 , this summer and it will serve dishes which feature crickets , bugs and worms			1
the 37 - year - old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the @entity18 dedicated to serving insects as protein to show how bugs can help feed the booming global population			1
@entity8 is opening the first insect restaurant in @entity18 , @entity7 , this summer which will serve worm fudge ice cream and bug burgers to peckish customers satay sago worm @entity27 : a stir - fry dish with baby sweetcorn , capsicum , courgettes and crickets mr @entity8 said the restaurant aims to ' normalise ' eating creepy crawlies on a daily basis			1
he said : ' we 're treating them as a normal food item , incorporating insect protein as an ingredient but using normal flavours we 're familiar with and everyday food items we recognise			1
' we want to pioneer the movement to normalise the eating of bugs on a day - to - day basis			1
' mr @entity8 and his team have found some interesting ways of incorporating insects into their cooking			1
the restaurant menu will include bug burritos and burgers , bamboo fudge worm ice cream and cricket kofta kebabs			1
trio of grubs : the chef has incorporated bugs and insects into dishes creepy - crawly dinner : @entity64 , cricket and grasshopper burger served with polenta chips some of the bugs used in recipes include sago worms , meal worms , crickets and grubs he said : ' as a chef you are always looking for ways to be creative			1
' we 've found that we can ground crickets up to make flour , which can be used in baking			1
we 've also created cricket grapes served with bamboo worm fudge ice cream			2
' mr @entity8 set up shop after a run of successful pop - up cafes serving grubs to intrigued diners across @entity89 last year			1
he said that the new dishes and food creations come off the back of years of research into the principles of entomophagy - the practice of eating insects			1
bug burritos being prepared @entity98 remains common in some parts of the world with at least two billion people worldwide eat insects , according to the @entity103 at the @entity104			1
yellow jacket wasp larvae are popular in @entity108 , cicadas are treasured in @entity109 , and weaver ants are devoured in @entity111			2
@entity112 , a food favourite in many @entity115 nations , can be fried , smoked , steamed , sun - dried or ground into a powder			1
the list of edible insect species is currently at 1,900 and growing			2
but he is keen not to put off squeamish customers - so if you do n't fancy a bug - based dish you will be able to order something a bit more traditional			2
@entity8 said : ' i 'm a firm believer that people are n't going to stop eating meat - that goes against biology - so bugs are also going to sit next to normal dishes on the menu			1
' for example , we 're serving both bug burgers and lamb kebabs			2
' @entity7 will be based at dr @entity140 's @entity139 - a science attraction run by @entity143 entomologist and television presenter dr @entity140			2
unconvinced ? consider @entity18 wine merchants @entity148 's world 's first insect and wine matching guide , created last year , which paired @entity150 with tarantulas , sparkling rose to barbecued locusts , sherry to giant waterbugs and @entity155 with sago worms			0
@entity158 - @entity157 have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce			0
@entity161 is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied @entity163 , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours			1
@entity64 - match their nutty taste and light , crunchy texture with a crisp @entity171 wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness			0
@entity175 are normally eaten deep fried , so think similar to fish and chips			0
a lively full bodied @entity150 will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula			0
@entity180 - these worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour			0
@entity190 is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice @entity195 - @entity194 taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the @entity198 you 'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness			0
the @entity202 is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif			0
chocolate dipped locusts - these locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds , but also have the sweetness from the chocolate			0
a rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours			0
@entity217 - the meat inside the water bug 's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop , while the head has hints of anise , so you 'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours			1
a dry sherry , and a @entity231 at that , is the only choice here			0
the crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours			0
queen @entity237 - their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon			0
they would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes			0
a gewürztraminer provides the perfect balance to crunchy textures			0
@entity158 - @entity157 have a strong , bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce			0
@entity161 is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied @entity163 , so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of sweet and sour			1
crickets - the flavours are much harder to distinguish in crickets and so they are often prepared with garlic and salt			2
nevertheless the nutty flavor that comes through means a perfect fit is a rich full - bodied white wine like @entity261			0
@entity262 - have an earthy and grassy flavour and a very crunchy texture , therefore we recommend a creamy dry @entity266 that will match well with the earthy flavours ( similar to matching with mushrooms ) and crunch .			0
