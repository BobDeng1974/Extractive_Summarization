by @entity0 after ten disastrous months as @entity3 manager , @entity1 was on the verge of the sack last night			1
the 50 - year - old @entity6 was said to have been summoned to an urgent meeting by the club ’s owners , who have apparently lost patience with his performance			1
however humiliating , @entity1 ’s exit will be exceptionally lucrative			0
heading for the exit ? manager @entity1 and his wife @entity14 , pictured on sunday as he faced the sack he is on £ 5million a year , including bonuses , with another five years left to run on his contract			1
his payout could be as high as £ 10million			2
he was handpicked for the job by his predecessor , @entity21 , whose success made @entity3 one of the biggest brands in world sport and secured a stock market listing in @entity27			2
but that status has been put at threat by atrocious results under @entity1 and social networking sites were quickly ablaze with rumours of his likely departure yesterday			1
no official comment was made on the situation , leaving shocked fans and investors in the dark			0
the club ’s share price dipped by 1.2 per cent			1
it is possible that an official statement was being delayed because stock market rules strictly govern announcements that can affect share prices			2
lucrative : he is on £ 5million a year , including bonuses , with another five years left to run on his contract despite being hand - picked by his predecessor , @entity1 has been marred by atrocious results this season last night , the share price for @entity3 dipped by 1.2 per cent as his future hung precariously reacting to developments , @entity3 fan and broadcaster @entity53 said on @entity56 : ‘ i ’m sure @entity1 is a nice man , but he just did n’t understand our team and our players did n’t understand him			1
this is the right thing			0
’ writer @entity61 joked : ‘ maybe @entity1 can get a job with @entity63			0
he ’s proved himself very good at staying out of @entity64			0
’ and broadcaster @entity65 added : ‘ please @entity3 , in the name of good sense and decency , do not sack @entity1			2
signed fans of @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
’ rare support came from tycoon @entity74 who said : ‘ he needs another season			0
’ it is thought @entity1 was called in for talks with chief executive @entity78 and the @entity79 , the @entity81 family that controls the club			2
fans dubbed @entity1 ' @entity85 ' as sir @entity21 implored them to get behind him , citing his excellent record he is expected to be dismissed within 48 hours with lifelong @entity3 player @entity87 set to step in until a new manager is appointed			1
speculation that sir @entity21 could return to the helm is believed to be misplaced , with @entity91 an early favourite			1
the son of a football scout and pattern maker , @entity1 grew up in the working - class @entity97 district of @entity98			2
@entity1 , 50 , and @entity14 live in a secluded house in @entity100 with their son @entity101 and daughter @entity103 after playing football in the lower leagues , he started his managerial career at unfashionable @entity107 , on a salary of about £ 50,000 a year			1
he had broad success in 11 seasons at top - flight @entity111 before signing for @entity3 last may and starting work on july 1			2
because of his backing from sir @entity21 , fans dubbed @entity1 ‘ @entity85 ’ but disillusion soon set in on the @entity116 terraces			1
an alarming decline has seen @entity3 collapse from champions to seventh in the @entity122 table			0
they will end the season with their lowest points total since the @entity122 was established in 1992			0
@entity1 , who is a practising @entity126 and @entity127 supporter , may be able to keep his @entity3 salary until he finds a new position			0
it is possible however that the club has written an under - performance clause into his contract that would allow for a quick pay - off			1
the length of @entity1 ’s contract was approved by sir @entity21 who , having suffered a torrid start at @entity3 himself , wanted his successor to have extended job security			1
@entity1 and his wife @entity14 live in a secluded house in @entity100 with their son @entity101 , who is a football agent , and daughter @entity103 , who has been in the spotlight after falsely being accused of having an affair with a @entity3 player			0
@entity1 ’s father and his mother - in - law also live in the grounds of the family home			0
@entity1 has told how he was out shopping with his wife when sir @entity21 called to offer him his job			1
he said : ‘ i had my jeans on and my t - shirt			0
i had to drop my wife at the shopping centre and i ’m saying to myself i ’d never ever go to a meeting with sir @entity21 with a pair of jeans on			1
’ @entity1 and his wife met at a @entity162 hotel two decades ago			0
of that first encounter , he has said : ‘ she saw me once , and , well , that was it			0
