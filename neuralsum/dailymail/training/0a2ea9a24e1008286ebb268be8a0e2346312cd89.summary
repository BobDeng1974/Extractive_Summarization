@entity1 or exhausted drivers are in twenty - one percent of deadly car crashes - more so than previously reported , a november study discovered			1
the @entity4 said in a study released this month that researchers looked at 14,268 car crashes that took place for 2009 to 2013 that involved a car being towed			1
it said ' results showed that an estimated 6 % of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene , 7 % of crashes in which a person received treatment for injuries sustained in the crash , 13 % of crashes in which a person was hospitalized , and 21 % of crashes in which a person was killed involved a drowsy driver			0
danger : the @entity4 says sleepy or exhausted drivers are in twenty - one percent of deadly car crashes ' if these proportions are applied to all reported crashes nationwide , results suggest that an average of 328,000 crashes annually , including 109,000 crashes that result in injuries and 6,400 fatal crashes , involve a drowsy driver			1
' the foundation points out ' a previous study by the @entity4 found that 7 % of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene , 13 % of crashes in which a person was hospitalized , and 17 % of fatal crashes involved a drowsy driver in years 1999 – 2008			2
' @entity4 president and ceo @entity47 said in a monday release ' this new research further confirms that drowsy driving is a serious traffic safety problem			2
unfortunately , drivers often underestimate this risk and overestimate their ability to combat drowsiness behind the wheel			0
' fatal : the study also projected sleepy drivers are in 6,400 deadly car crashes across the country each year ' despite the fact that 95 percent of @entity63 deem it " unacceptable " to drive when they are so tired that they have a hard time keeping their eyes open , more than 28 percent admit to doing so in the last month , ' he added			1
' like other impairments , driving while drowsy is not without risk			0
' the monday release highlighted older findings ' that young adult drivers , ages 19 - 24 , are the most likely to admit to driving while drowsy , with 33 percent reporting doing so in the last month			2
in contrast , the oldest drivers ( ages 75 + ) and the youngest ( ages 16 - 18 ) were the least likely to report the same offense			0
' the foundation said in the release it ' is highlighting the risks of drowsy driving in support of the @entity87 ’s @entity86 , which runs november 2 - 9			0
