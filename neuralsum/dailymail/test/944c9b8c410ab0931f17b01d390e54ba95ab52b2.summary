@entity1 's astroturf candidacy is in full swing in @entity3			1
her tuesday morning visit to a coffee shop in @entity6 , @entity3 was staged from beginning to end , according to @entity8 , one of the men pictured sitting at the table with mrs. @entity1			1
@entity8 told @entity11 that campaign staffer @entity12 called and asked him and two other young people to meet him tuesday morning at a restaurant in @entity15 , a nearby city			1
@entity12 then drove them to the coffee house to meet @entity18 after vetting them for about a half - hour			1
the three got the lion 's share of mrs. @entity1 's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a ' roundtable ' – the first of many in her brief @entity3 campaign swing			1
bird himself is a frequent participant in @entity31 events			2
he interned with president @entity34 's 2012 presidential re-election campaign , and was tapped to chauffeur vice president @entity35 in october 2014 when he visited @entity15			1
' what happened is , we were just asked to be there by @entity39 , ' @entity8 said wednesday in a phone interview			0
' the other two , he confirmed , were @entity56 president @entity55 and @entity57 of the @entity59 employee @entity58			0
' it was supposed to be a strategy meeting , ' @entity8 recalled , ' to get our thoughts about issues			0
but then all of a sudden he says , " hey , we have secretary @entity18 coming in , would you like to go meet her ? " ' ' and then we got in a car – @entity39 's car – and we went up to the coffee house , and we sat at a table and then @entity1 just came up and talked with us			1
' @entity8 said ' we all were called			2
' ' i mean , @entity39 asked us all to do – to go to a meeting with him			0
and we did n't really know what it was about			0
i mean , he did			0
' it 's unclear how many @entity77 featured in photographs with @entity18 that rocketed around the country on tuesday were planted			2
' the mayor of @entity81 was there , and his wife was there , ' @entity8 said , recalling the scene at the coffee shop			2
@entity12 was executive director of the @entity31 until a month ago			1
@entity18 's team tapped him last week to be its political director in @entity3			1
he did not respond to a request for comment			0
bird is a government and community relations coordinator at @entity93 in @entity15 , @entity3 , according to his @entity95 profile			1
a coworker at @entity97 said wednesday that @entity8 is ' basically a lobbyist in training			0
that 's what he wants to do			0
' @entity8 disagreed , saying his role was ' more public relations			0
' he 's also an outspoken progressive whose @entity105 wall shows he ordered a ' @entity107 ' bumper sticker 22 months ago			0
' is it 2016 yet ? ' he wrote in may 2013			0
@entity18 's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous , handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate , posing with @entity114 at a gas station and venturing into an @entity117 restaurant for lunch			1
when no one recognized the former first lady – she was wearing sunglasses – the campaign leaked information to the @entity124 so its reporters could get security - camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters			0
scripting supposedly off - the - cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt @entity18 especially hard since her gonzo road - trip journey to @entity133 's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold , calculating and politically venomous			1
and planting party insiders in place of typical @entity77 wo n't go over well in the @entity3 , where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full - contact sport			0
@entity140 : setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics , but @entity77 take presidential contests seriously and could punish @entity18 for the deception the fixer : @entity8 said @entity148 ( left , pictured with vp @entity35 ) , who was executive director of the @entity31 until he left last month to help @entity18 's statewide political effort , recruited him and others to attend the ' spontaneous ' coffee meeting @entity18 's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as ' everyday ' @entity133 who were actually partisans with political connections			1
one was even a former campaign manager for @entity160 , the @entity162 @entity161 who mounted a failed bid for @entity162 governor last year			0
in @entity81 on tuesday , @entity165 and other outlets referred to @entity8 as a ' student ' at @entity168 , not as a hospital government - affairs staffer with @entity171 street - cred			1
he does study at @entity172 – part - time			0
but @entity8 's ties to the party are deep enough that his @entity105 wall includes a photo of him standing in front of @entity35 's limousine in @entity15			1
' i was driving the vice president when he was in town in october , ' @entity8 noted in a @entity105 comment			2
@entity35 was not there on official government business , but for a campaign stop in support of @entity161 @entity187			2
' the vice president will attend a grassroots event for @entity187 for @entity3 with representative @entity189 , ' according to @entity191 press guidance for his october 27 , 2014 schedule .			2

@entity8 sat for coffee on tuesday morning in the town of @entity6 , @entity3 , chatting with @entity1 as photographers snapped pictures
news reports called him a ' student ' and her campaign called it an *unscripted* event
but @entity18 's @entity3 political director @entity12 drove @entity8 and two other people to the coffee house
bird is a hospital government relations official who interned with @entity34 's 2012 presidential campaign
the @entity31 , which @entity12 ran until a month ago , *tasked* him to be @entity35 's driver during an october @entity213 campaign trip in @entity15
