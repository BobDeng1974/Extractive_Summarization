@entity1 manager @entity0 pointed the finger of blame at ref @entity4 after @entity5 was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1 - 1 draw with @entity9 in the @entity10			1
@entity5 was astonished to be shown a red card along with @entity12 after the @entity13 and @entity14 clashed on the ground following a poor tackle by @entity9 captain @entity17 on @entity18 – who appeared to kick @entity17 ’s head in retaliation			1
@entity0 vowed to appeal in a bid to clear @entity5 for next sunday ’s @entity23 final against @entity25 ’s men at @entity26 , and it remains to be seen whether @entity29 compliance officer @entity28 will take retrospective action against @entity14 , @entity18 or @entity17 , with tv pictures indicating they could all have seen red			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 was n't impressed with referee @entity4 's performance @entity5 was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1 - 1 draw with @entity9 but the @entity1 boss claimed that , had the match official sent off @entity17 for the initial challenge , the ensuing melee and embarrassing card blunder would have been avoided			1
‘ i think we will be appealing , ’ said @entity0 , whose team were reduced to nine men in the second half when @entity43 was sent off for handling the ball in the box			1
‘ @entity5 feels a bit hard done to for being sent off for nothing			1
he was n’t even involved in the incident			2
but i think the ref should have dealt with the original bad challenge ( from @entity17 ) that sparked the whole thing off			2
it was a two - footed challenge off the deck			2
it was a bad onebut it did n’t get dealt with properly			0
‘ we should be talking about the football rather than the ugly scenes			0
but , for me , the officials should have dealt with it first and we would not have had the problems we had today			0
’ asked if he expects @entity17 to be hit with disciplinary action from the @entity29 , @entity0 replied : ‘ no comment			1
’ @entity18 scored @entity1 ’s opener on the stroke of half time after @entity65 appeared to go down easily in the box , with @entity9 boss @entity25 later insisting the player should be punished for diving			1
three minutes after the break , @entity1 ’s @entity43 was dismissed for blocking a goal - bound drive by @entity72 but the striker ’s penalty was saved by keeper @entity75			1
@entity4 ended up sending three players off , and @entity1 will appeal the red card of @entity5 @entity72 had the last laugh , however , with a headed equaliser in the 71st minute to take the match to a replay at @entity82 on march 18			1
@entity18 was lucky to still be on the park after kicking out at @entity17 but @entity0 claimed not to have seen the incident			1
‘ i need to see it			0
i have n’t looked back at the tv footage			0
and when @entity18 gets tackled by @entity17 , the ball breaks and @entity14 wins the challenge to put us through and i was looking at that next bit of play			1
i did not see what happened with @entity12 , @entity14 or anyone else			1
i actually did n’t know the ref had got the wrong man until @entity5 came over and told me			2
it was a melee but the ref did not deal with the original bad challenge which sparked it all off			0
’ @entity0 , whose side will now face @entity9 four times in march , also defended young striker @entity65			1
‘ i do n’t think he dived , ’ he said			0
‘ i think he ( @entity105 ) has caught him although he has n’t caught him on the leg			0
it might have been soft but it was a penalty			0
’ @entity0 had no complaints about the spot - kick award and red card when @entity43 handled a shot by @entity72			2
‘ rules are rules but @entity113 made a great save			0
he did n’t deserve to lose a goal today			0
but we switched off for one moment and @entity72 peels off and scores a header			0
‘ we can take certain things from today ’s game but @entity9 will be saying the same			2
cool heads will be needed for the final next week			0
the disciplinary side needs to be better			0
‘ it ’s a chance for silverware and for the lads to create a bit of history			0
will i be sick of the sight of @entity9 by the end of our four games this month ? not if we beat them			2
