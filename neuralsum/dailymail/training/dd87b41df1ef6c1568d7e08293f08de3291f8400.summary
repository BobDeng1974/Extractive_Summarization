by @entity0 published : 17:03 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 17:03 est , 19 june 2013 flare up : @entity0 and a rash caused by her nickel allergy for nearly five years , the lesion on my stomach simply refused to heal			1
what started as a ten pence - sized cluster of red bumps just above my belly button , developed within weeks into an angry red sore patch the size of my palm			2
impossibly itchy , it would n't clear up , despite liberal applications of just about everything from antiseptic and anti-histamine creams to calamine lotion			0
scratching , naturally , only made the condition worse			0
but what had caused this extreme reaction ? a tropical insect bite ? a rare skin infection ? no. when i eventually consulted a private dermatologist , it turned out a belt buckle and the button on the fly of my jeans were to blame			0
why ? they both contained the everyday , silvery - white metal , nickel , which is found in everything from costume jewellery to small change			1
despite never having had a problem before , suddenly in my mid- 20s i 'd become highly allergic to it			0
since then i 've been caught out by bra clasps , chain straps on handbags and even sunglasses with metal arms , all of which left angry welts on my skin , sometimes within minutes of coming into contact with them			2
so when i read last week that there 's been a massive surge in nickel allergies - one in ten @entity53 is now a fellow sufferer - i was n't surprised			1
it 's an allergy that seems insignificant until you actually suffer from it yourself , and it is reported that one in five women , like me , does			2
that 's because nickel is everywhere in places you 'd never imagine			1
it 's used in over 300,000 items from batteries and cooking utensils , to pans and , yes , the proverbial kitchen sink			2
it 's found in paper clips , toasters , zips , car keys , bath plugs , door handles , scissors and even in the metal trims and keypads of many mobile phones			1
earlier this month doctors deemed it a ' public health concern ' after a study revealed that even loose change could be sparking severe allergic reactions			0
analysis has shown that the five and ten pence coins introduced since january 2012 contain four times more of the metal than they used to			1
cheaper to produce than the old coins , which were made from an alloy of around 70 per cent copper and 25 per cent nickel , the new slightly thicker coins are steel with a nickel coating			2
experts have warned that handling these coins regularly could trigger contact eczema or dermatitis , and cause painful cracked and sore skin			1
there are increasing amounts of nickel in coinage @entity107 , of @entity108 , says many nickel allergy sufferers already report having to wear rubber gloves when handling coins , and with the new 5p and 10p pieces she fears the problem may become even more prevalent , especially among workers such as shop cashiers and bus drivers who handle money all day			2
nickel can even penetrate cloth , so men who put their loose change in their pockets can find it aggravates the skin on their legs underneath			2
prevalent in the earth 's crust , nickel is easily available and cheap			1
it 's also hard - wearing and does n't corrode , which makes it a popular choice in manufacturing			2
it can even get into our food from the equipment used to handle , cook or store it			0
tinned tuna , for example , contains nickel from the can			2
as a trace element , nickel occurs naturally in soil and , as it is absorbed through the roots of many plants , it is found in most vegetables , fruits and nuts			2
@entity156 , raspberries , peanuts and chickpeas are high in nickel , as are many of the products derived from them including chocolate and wine			0
thankfully i 've yet to suffer a reaction to either , but that 's not to say i wo n't in the future			0
the allergy has a way of creeping up on sufferers			0
consultant dermatologist dr @entity169 warns that a nickel allergy can strike anyone at any time			0
' like most allergies , it can develop suddenly at any age due to changes in the body 's immune system and exposure to an irritant , ' she says			1
' women have a higher risk simply because they are more likely to be exposed to nickel through jewellery			1
' in a nutshell , the more we 're exposed to it , the more likely we are to become sensitive to it and , with the increasing use of nickel , the numbers will only continue soaring			1
' she explains that sensitisation occurs when the body starts thinking it 's under attack and the immune system goes into overdrive , attacking healthy cells and tissue , and resulting contact eczema or dermatitis			1
five years ago i developed hives - a bumpy red rash - after swapping my usual breakfast cereal for porridge			0
initially , make - up and a new moisturiser were chief suspects until my dermatologist told me that rolled porridge oats contain high levels of nickel			0
within days of giving up porridge , the eczema was less itchy , and within a few weeks it had disappeared			1
and a nickel allergy can also trigger a reaction on other patches of skin that have n't been in contact with it , what @entity107 calls ' a referred reaction '			1
' it can be baffling for people who are n't yet aware they 're allergic to nickel , ' she says			1
even the nickel in bra clasps and straps can trigger a reaction in someone with an allergy though rare , some people are so sensitive to nickel that it can trigger an immediate , and potentially fatal , reaction known as anaphylactic shock , where the airways close in on themselves			1
the nickel allergy problem has become so great that @entity240 has introduced strict new rules on how much nickel can be used in items worn next to the skin such as watchstraps , earrings and necklaces			0
coins were excluded because it was thought they did not release enough nickel to trigger reactions			1
but researchers from the @entity253 at @entity253 , @entity254 , now say the high nickel levels in coins will dramatically escalate the problem of allergies in @entity53			1
so what can you do if you 're a sufferer ? as i found out myself , painting offending items with clear nail varnish can act as a barrier but it is n't foolproof			0
' anti-histamine tablets and creams help to break the itch - scratch cycle and relieve discomfort , ' adds dr @entity169 , ' but to get rid of contact eczema you need a prescribed emollient to act as a barrier and reduce the dryness , and a topical steroid cream to reduce the immune reaction			0
' it was a long course of steroid cream that eventually helped clear up the patch on my stomach			0
unfortunately , what 's best is avoiding the metal completely , something that 's increasingly difficult			1
having a nickel allergy is a pain , quite literally , but perhaps it 's not all bad			1
in 2011 , @entity288 researchers found that those who reacted to common irritants such as perfume or nickel were less likely to develop three different cancers			0
this may be because contact allergies , where the body falsely believes it is under attack , help prime the immune system to be super responsive and fight off other threats			0
as the saying goes : ' every cloud has aâ € ¦			0
. ' actually , i 'd prefer a gold lining			0
@entity303 often contains nickel to strengthen it .			0

one in ten @entity53 now suffers from nickel allergies
that 's because these days the cheap metal is everywhere !
the more we 're exposed to it , the more we become sensitive to it *...*
@entity315 can trigger eczema , dermatitis , and even a fatal anaphylactic shock
