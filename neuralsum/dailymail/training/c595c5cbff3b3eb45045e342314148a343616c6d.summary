like a king with a royal proclamation , the inventor of the @entity2 file format has put an end to all debate over how his invention ’s name shall be pronounced			1
‘ it is a soft “ g , ” pronounced “ jif			2
” end of story , ’ said @entity9			2
the man who gave the world the quintessential meme - making file type hath spoken			1
but was there really that much question ? in a word : yes			2
so says he : @entity19 , inventor of the @entity2 , accepts a @entity21 award may 21			1
he says his invention is pronounced with a soft ' g. ' once just a part of the jargon of hardcore computer enthusiasts , how to properly say @entity2 has been debated since it was invented in 1987 as a means of neatly compressing images			1
it has since become synonymous , with the help of a famous dancing baby , with brief and catchy animated images			2
you need only visit a @entity34 page or peruse any @entity36 article to see how ubiquitous the once nerdy name has become			2
and you need only run a @entity40 search for ‘ how to pronounce ’ to see how active the pronunciation war remains			0
before you ’ve even hit the ‘ g , ’ the engine has already guessed what you were thinking			0
the internet is rampant with websites , blogs , and articles dedicated to the question of how to pronounce the shortened form of @entity2			1
choosy : an image by the heavy @entity2 users at @entity36 concurs , likeing the pronunciation to that of the ubiquitous peanut butter a @entity34 dedicated to the question exists , though it comes to no solid conclusion			1
there is also the @entity60 , which takes the side of mr. @entity9 , who purportedly uses the mnemonic device ‘ choosy developers choose @entity2 , ’ to remind everyone it ’s a soft ‘ g ’ just like the peanut butter			1
there 's also a @entity69 video on the subject			0
even the president of the @entity72 has taken a stand			0
when the @entity75 debuted its own @entity34 page in april , it posted a graph of what to expect on its new microblog			0
among the offerings was ‘ @entity2 ( hard “ g ” ) ’			1
and that is , if you were wondering , the other way to speak the term			0
a hard ‘ g ’ like in ‘ gift			2
’ partisanship : @entity88 , disagrees			0
the official @entity75 @entity34 promises ' @entity2 ( @entity89 " ) ' but do n’t mention that to @entity9			1
and do n’t try to say both are correct , either			0
‘ the @entity94 accepts both pronunciations , ’ mr. @entity9 said in an email interview with the @entity93			0
’ @entity9 ’s invention has won him much praise over the last 25 years and even more in the last five or so as meme culture has embraced the file as a means of quickly and easily moving messages motivated by everything from comedy to politics across the @entity106			0
@entity9 was even honored tuesday with a @entity107 in recognition of inventing the file format			0
in the words of the official @entity21 website : ‘ the proliferation of the @entity2 within today 's meme - powered , @entity34 - driven pop culture , proves it a lasting format still among the most celebrated on the @entity106 ( despite the hotly contested controversy over its correct pronunciation )			1
with 2012 being the 25th anniversary of the @entity2 we think the 17th @entity120 is a most fitting event to honor and celebrate @entity9 and this historical achievement			1
’ brave : but even in the face of tyranny and elitism , the @entity2 's inventor stands firm			1
' the @entity94 accepts both pronunciations ' he said			0

@entity19 accepted a @entity131 on may 21 for giving the gift of the @entity2 to the world
