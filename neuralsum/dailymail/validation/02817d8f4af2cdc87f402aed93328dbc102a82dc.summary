an emotional @entity0 dedicated @entity3 ’s unprecedented fifth @entity2 triumph to his former team - mate and friend @entity4 after his side trounced @entity7 in the final at @entity9			1
@entity0 – who joins @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 ( twice ) in the pantheon of @entity3 ’s @entity2 - winning captains – scored a classy 74 in 72 balls in his final one - day international before quitting the format to focus on @entity17			1
and with @entity3 overhauling the @entity18 ’ disappointing total of 183 with seven wickets and nearly 17 overs to spare , he went out in style , watched by an @entity9 crowd of 93,013 – an official world record for a single day ’s cricket			1
@entity0 kisses the @entity2 after guiding his team to glory at the @entity9 the @entity3 side celebrate after defeating @entity7 to be crowned @entity2 champions @entity0 celebrates with his wife @entity30 and the trophy in the @entity33 dressing room referring to the black armband he wore in memory of @entity4 , who died in november after being struck on the neck by a short - pitched delivery during a domestic game in @entity39 , @entity0 said : ‘ as you can see it 's got ph on it			1
i ’ll wear it every game i play for @entity3			0
for everyone in @entity33 cricket it ’s been a tough few months			0
‘ we played this @entity2 with 16 players and this is certainly dedicated to our little brother and team - mate @entity4			1
@entity53 used to party as good as any of them , so i ’ll make sure we drink two at a time – one for @entity53 and one for us			0
' @entity4 used to party as good as any of them so i 'll make sure we drink two ( beers ) at a time tonight , one for @entity53 and one for us			0
' @entity4 would have approved of the manner in which @entity3 crushed their trans - @entity63 cousins , even if the neutrals were deprived of the climax which the tournament – if it ’s honest with itself – so badly needed			1
from the moment @entity72 bowled @entity7 ’s captain and talisman @entity74 in the game ’s first over , a sense of inevitability descended on the @entity9 like the evening shadows			1
here were the pre-tournament favourites doling out a painful lesson to a team taking part in their first @entity2 final			1
the @entity33 captain receives a kiss from his wife @entity30 after winning the @entity2 @entity86 did n't do his hopes of an @entity89 recall any good by posing with @entity90 the one - way traffic was held up only during a gutsy fourth - wicket stand of 111 between @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity7 ’s hero during their semi-final thriller against @entity97			1
but @entity90 , named man of the match for figures of 3 for 36 , removed @entity93 and the big - hitting @entity101 in the first over of the batting powerplay , and wicketkeeper @entity104 fell in the next , to the outstanding @entity72			0
@entity94 went on to make 83 , but @entity7 ’s last seven fell for just 33 in 10 overs			0
after eight successive games on their smaller , less intimidating , home grounds , they never came to terms with either the occasion or the relentlessness of the @entity33 attack			0
the dismissal of @entity115 , who had hammered @entity116 for an unbeaten 237 from 163 balls in the quarter - finals , summed up their day : trying to dab a gentle off - break from @entity121 through backward point , he was bowled for 15			0
@entity3 lost @entity123 to @entity124 in the second over of the reply , but for @entity7 ’s bowlers that was as good as it got			1
@entity128 hit 45 in 46 balls , before @entity0 joined @entity130 – his heir apparent – to add 112			0
after carting @entity131 for four successive fours , @entity0 chopped on against @entity133 with nine runs still needed , but @entity130 was there at the end , a fifth successive half - century in his increasingly irresistible bag			2
@entity0 received a standing ovation as he left the field having been dismissed in his final one - day international the @entity33 captain scored 74 from 72 deliveries to anchor his team 's chase of 184 @entity0 said : ' we 're really proud , it 's a wonderful achievement			1
it 's a great thing just to make a @entity2 final , but to be able to win in your own back yard in front of your family and friends is extremely special and i guarantee we 'll celebrate hard tonight			2
' obviously i 'm over the moon			0
' the @entity7 team deserve a lot of credit			2
they 're always a tough team to beat it seems in any sporting event			0
@entity3 v @entity7 is always an exciting contest and tonight was no different			2
' ' it 's been an honour and a privilege to represent my country in both test and one - day cricket and @entity172 cricket			2
' the time is right for me to walk away from one - day cricket , but i 'll keep playing test cricket			1
' @entity0 poses with the @entity2 trophy after @entity3 's fourth success in the last five editions @entity0 dedicated the victory to @entity4 , who died after being hit on the side of the head by a bouncer as @entity3 prepared to celebrate into the night and beyond , it was left to @entity74 to confirm his status as one of the @entity2 ’s most impressive characters			1
he said : ' it 's been one hell of a ride for us right the way through			0
i think we 've played some outstanding cricket and we ran into an outstanding @entity3 team tonight who continue to set the way in international cricket and full credit to them , they deserve to be champions			2
' @entity0 as well , he deserves to bow out a @entity2 - winning champion too			1
they were outstanding in this @entity2 and thoroughly deserved to win			2
' we were the second - best team on the day and all credit to @entity3			1
' @entity74 took time to reflect on the tournament as a whole and said he was ' proud ' of his team 's performances as they became the first @entity7 side to reach a @entity2 final			1
he added : ' we 've forged some memories and friendships that will last forever			0
@entity7 captain @entity74 admitted his side were second best on the day ' obviously we 're not able to lift the trophy but the brand of cricket and the entertainment that we 've been able to give people throughout our country and throughout the world is something we 're immensely proud of			2
' we have no regrets and we walk away from this tournament with our heads held high			0
' it 's the greatest time of your life to be able to represent your country on the international stage with a group of friends and then put your skills against the world 's best - it is the greatest time of our lives and that 's how we tried to play the game , play with a free spirit and plenty of heart all the way along			0
' it 's taken us so far in this tournament but we were n't obviously able to get over the final hurdle , but it 's something that i 'm immensely proud of , all the guys in the team , all the management group and all those that have been part of this team over the last few years and helped build us into what we are			0
' we 've still got some work to do but we can be very proud of our achievements in this tournament			0
