@entity0 faces a substantial pay cut if his goals are not enough to keep @entity3 in the @entity4 – but is set to attract interest should he continue his scoring streak			1
whatever @entity3 's @entity4 status this summer , @entity0 's future will be discussed as his contract , worth £ 50,000 per week , enters its final two years and the @entity11 striker has ambitions to play @entity14 football			1
@entity15 have kept tabs on @entity0 since before he ruptured his @entity17 12 months ago and remain on the lookout for a striker			1
the wealthy @entity22 club , currently second in @entity20 , should have funds available from @entity25 money , even after their £ 42million splurge on @entity28 duo @entity27 and @entity29			0
@entity0 celebrates his opening goal against @entity31 at @entity32 on tuesday @entity3 value their top scorer at £ 25million however , and even then would remain hugely reluctant to sell with manager @entity34 a big fan			1
@entity36 is set to offload the club come the closed season and new owners will have their own thoughts			0
a hat - trick by @entity0 in the 3 - 3 draw with @entity31 , capped by a brilliant free - kick , underlined his return to form under @entity34			1
he has scored seven goals in his last five @entity3 games , earning the team an additional three points in the process – the current gap to the drop zone			1
@entity0 went on to net a hat - trick which salvaged a vital point for his side but should @entity3 slip below the dreaded dotted line and out of the @entity4 , @entity0 is in line for an approximate 30 per cent reduction on his wages to £ 35,000 a week			1
the 24 - year - old would look to leave @entity32 in that scenario , rather than play in the @entity62 , with a host of clubs likely to express interest			0
there is , however , no relegation release clause			0
even if @entity3 stay in the @entity69 will assess his options			1
two years ago he handed in a transfer request to try to force a move to @entity74 following his debut season in @entity76 yielding 23 goals			0
the arrival of @entity34 at @entity32 has rejuvenated @entity0 's form in front of goal this season he signed a new four - year deal on vastly improved terms			2
last season was less successful , bringing 11 goals before serious injury struck last april ruling @entity0 out of the @entity87			2
his form suffered on return to the side last october , and at times he cut a bereft figure starved of service under @entity94 's regime			0
@entity94 even dropped @entity0 in his penultimate game in charge at home to @entity28			2
@entity34 's arrival has seen @entity0 return to his best , with a goal every 87 minutes			2
that kind of strike rate should keep @entity3 up , but also alert top - flight clubs			2
spurs are looking to sign young players around the £ 15million mark , though , while @entity106 would need to shift @entity107			0
@entity108 is convinced @entity0 's goals will ensure @entity3 's @entity4 survival this season @entity0 is comfortable with life in @entity112 and at @entity3 , but holds desires to play higher up the league and in continental competitions			1
qualification for the @entity117 is still a possibility through the @entity119 for @entity3 , of course			0
teenage winger @entity108 , who started his first @entity4 match against @entity31 , is adamant @entity0 will help keep @entity3 safe			1
' yes , when you have @entity123 in the team who can score goals every game , ' he said			0
' we are going to go in saturday 's game ( at @entity74 ) positive			0
100 per cent we will stay up			0

@entity0 is currently paid £ 50,000 per week at @entity3
the @entity133 striker has two years left on his current contract
@entity15 have been keeping tabs on the @entity3 forward
