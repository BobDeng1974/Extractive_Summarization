if you ’re a @entity2 , it ’s time to reset your clocks because it ’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours , 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought			1
@entity2 ’s rotation period - the time it takes to rotate once around its axis - has been notoriously difficult to estimate in the past because of the planet ’s unique properties			0
but using measurements of the ringed planet ’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density , scientists have determined a more exact value for a day on the planet			2
scientists in @entity18 have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet ( shown )			1
previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours , 39 minutes and 22 seconds			1
but new figure of 10 hours , 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate			1
this is based on measuring its gravitational field , shape and density the research was carried out by scientists at @entity30 in @entity18			2
radio measurements by the voyager spacecraft had estimated @entity2 's day at 10 hours , 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s			2
in 2006 , astronomers used more advanced equipment to measure the planet 's rotation ending up with a measurement of about 10 hours and 47 minutes			2
but an estimate that was 12 minutes shorter in 2009 only added to the confusion			0
@entity40 : 58 days and 15 hours @entity41 : 243 days @entity42 : 23 hours , 56 minutes , 4 seconds @entity43 : 24 hours , 39 minutes , 35 seconds @entity44 : 9.9 hours @entity2 : 10 hours , 32 minutes and 45 seconds @entity45 : 17 hours , 14 minutes and 24 seconds @entity46 : 16 hours , 6 minutes and 36 seconds the new method , though , provides what might be the most accurate reading so far			1
gas giants - such as @entity2 and @entity44 - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed , so other methods of finding this property must be found			0
the same formula came up with the correct rotation period of @entity44 - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field			0
@entity2 ’s magnetic pole is aligned with its rotational axis and this means - unlike @entity44 - its rotation period can not be calculated using the magnetic field alone			2
but verifying the method with @entity44 allowed scientists to apply the same technique to @entity2			0
alternative methods such as measuring @entity2 ’s radio emissions or wind field , or tracking the planet ’s clouds , had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes			1
the same method came up with the correct rotation period of @entity44 ( pictured ) - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field			0
verifying the method with @entity44 allowed scientists to apply the same technique to @entity2 and come up with the revised estimate scientists used measurements of the ringed planet ’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density , some of which was gathered by the @entity86 in orbit ( artist 's illustration shown ) ‘ the alignment of @entity2 ’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period , ’ said planetary scientist dr @entity90 of @entity30			1
‘ here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds ( plus or minus 46 seconds ) based upon an optimisation approach using @entity2 ’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles			1
‘ to validate our method we applied the same procedure to @entity44 and correctly recovered its well - known rotation period			0
’ gas giants - such as @entity2 and @entity44 - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed , so other methods of finding this property must be found			0
the study , published online in @entity114 , could be used in the future to derive the rotation period of other giant planets and planets outside our solar system .			0
