@entity131 in the @entity54 goal was forced to save two shots from @entity127 before the break , while @entity135 fired a shot just wide of the mark			0
a green card for @entity139 proved costly 13 minutes into the second half as shortly after she left the field , @entity127 slotted home from another short corner			0
