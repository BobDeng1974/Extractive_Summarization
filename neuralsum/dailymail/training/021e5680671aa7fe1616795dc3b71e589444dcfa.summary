@entity0 and @entity1 are expected to confirm within 24 hours that their grudge re-match will take place at @entity6			1
assuming there are no last - minute hitches , this will be the first fight at the new stadium and the first to take place on the fabled turf this century			2
it is a thrilling prospect for the public and an historic occasion for the two fighters - but a brave , high - risk gamble by the promoter			0
he won in the fifth			0
1994 : @entity41 v @entity39 @entity41 was @entity42 heavyweight champion but suffered a shock second - round knockout			0
1995 : @entity46 v @entity39 a year on from beating @entity41 , @entity39 returned to @entity6 but lost his title to @entity46 on points			2
@entity25 had promised ‘ an audacious ’ choice of arena for his may 31 spectacular			0
that , it certainly is			0
all the more so given the minimal amount of time @entity6 will have to convert the stadium for boxing following @entity58 ’s @entity57 warm - up game against @entity59 the previous evening			1
@entity6 staff are on alert to work through the night but that will increase the cost of renting this already expensive site			2
@entity25 is convinced that the excitement and controversy generated by the first fight – won by @entity0 with a somewhat premature stoppage after @entity1 had knocked him down and built a points lead – will galvanise a crowd approaching @entity6 ’s 90,000 capacity			1
if the attendance falls significantly short of that , in a venue this huge , he risks a drop in atmosphere as well as a fall in revenue			0
not much time : @entity6 would have just one day to prepare for the fight after @entity58 v @entity59 on may 30 under the weather : @entity0 controversially stopped @entity1 in the ninth round in november stopped : many believe referee @entity83 should have allowed the november fight to continue past records indicate the scale of the gamble			1
the biggest fight ever to take place in the old stadium was that in which @entity31 sat @entity29 briefly on his famous backside , 51 years ago this month			2
yet despite the @entity96 public ’s love affair with our ' enery and its fascination with the brash young @entity100 who would become @entity101 , it drew just 40,000 – @entity102 and @entity103 prominent among them			0
after @entity31 retired and the nation transferred its affections to @entity46 , a gathering of similar size watched his failed attempt in the summer of 1986 to wrench the world heavyweight title from @entity111			0
when our @entity46 finally fulfilled his championship dream nine years later , by defeating @entity39 , there were only 23,000 in the stadium			0
figures : @entity31 's bout against @entity29 drew a crowd of 40,000 at @entity6 51 years ago famous : @entity31 sat @entity101 on his backside during the non-title fight new hero : @entity46 attracted a similar crowd in 1986 when he lost against @entity111 missed opportunity ? @entity126 's fight with @entity127 would have drawn record numbers support : around 30,000 fans folowed @entity126 and would 've drawn plenty more fighting at home @entity126 , who was followed to his fights in @entity100 by an army of more than 30,000 fans , would surely have surpassed all those numbers had @entity127 not refused to leave his home comforts of @entity136			1
for big fights these days the media hype is more frenzied and there is more time to sell the event			0
even so , a live gate of 60,000 would represent an enormous achievement by @entity25			0
@entity6 became the front runner after @entity0 and @entity1 had vetoed each other ’s preferred venues , respectively @entity148 ’s @entity147 and @entity149 , @entity150			2
two other stadia - @entity152 ’s @entity151 and @entity155 ’s roofed millennium – were under consideration but @entity25 worked long and hard to pull off his @entity6 coup			2
under consideration : @entity152 's @entity151 was thought of as a potential venue for the fight no thanks ! @entity1 vetoed @entity0 's preferred stadium - @entity148 's @entity147 another veto – that of @entity58 manager @entity163 in refusing a proposal to shift the @entity59 date – has been overcome by @entity6 calculating they can re-configure for boxing in no longer than 18 hours			1
the cheaper seats high in the stands are a considerable distance from the ring but the ‘ i was there ’ attraction of attending an occasion of such historic significance should help boost sales			0
the official announcement is scheduled to be made at @entity6 at 11 am tuesday morning by @entity179 , who will be broadcasting the fight on their pay - per - view @entity183 channel			1
elsewhere , @entity0 and @entity1 are already in training for their second world super-middleweight title slugfest			0
@entity188 is unlikely to respond to @entity127 ’s latest provocation by helping the @entity100 boost his pay - tv income from his may 3 fight with @entity192			1
@entity127 picked @entity193 months after @entity188 was promised the fight of a lifetime if he waited for this spring date			1
star appeal : @entity188 will want to top his own bill now the world ’s top pound - for - pound boxer has told @entity202 ’s former two - time world champion he can earn a september clash with him by appearing on his undercard			2
@entity127 tweeted a challenge to @entity188 to fight his friend and protegee @entity206 , saying he would fight the @entity58 next ‘ if you beat him , which you wo n’t			1
’ @entity192 secured his @entity127 pay - night by beating @entity206 but it is by no means certain that an @entity212 will prove a sizeable attraction to @entity215 viewers			1
@entity188 versus @entity206 would help sell the event			1
but unless @entity127 is prepared to sign the pre-contract this time , which is improbable , @entity188 will want to top his own bill this spring			1
@entity206 remains a potential opponent , along with @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and a re-match with @entity224			0
the need for @entity226 to step up in class was evident in his fifth quick ko victory – this one over a lumbering @entity230 – on saturday night			1
awesome prospect : @entity226 ( black trunks ) was too strong for @entity230 on saturday @entity96 ’s @entity234 super-heavyweight gold medallist is an awesome prospect but needs testing			1
to that end promoter @entity25 is thinking of pitching him against one of two veteran @entity96 heavies – @entity239 or @entity240 – on the undercard of @entity243 ’s world title fight on april 19			0
that looks like a sensible route towards a @entity96 title fight later this year .			0

a crowd of 60,000 could watch fight at @entity6 on may 31
@entity251 will have just 18 hours to convert stadium after @entity58 face @entity59 in *football* friendly
official announcement scheduled to be made at @entity6 at 11am on tuesday morning
@entity188 considers options despite offer to face @entity127 's protegee @entity206
@entity226 must take step up after quick ko of lumbering @entity230
