@entity0 of @entity1 faces 22 years in jail after a @entity4 court pressed charges against her for secretly filming in an orphanage			1
the charges relate to an undercover documentary @entity8 made with @entity9 in 2008 to expose ' appalling ' conditions in state run institutions			1
a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ‘ @entity0 of @entity1 has fully co-operated with both the @entity4 and @entity14 authorities at all times on this issue			2
from a @entity14 perspective , the @entity0 has been told by the @entity30 that the case is closed			1
the action today reported by the @entity4 authorities is news to all			2
’ yesterday a court accused prince @entity38 's former wife in absentia of ' going against the law in acquiring footage and violating privacy ' of five children			1
she faces a maximum term of 22 and - a - half years in prison if convicted			2
no trial date has been set			2
' anywhere else it would be the authorities running these homes who were in the dock , ' a source close to the @entity0 said			2
' it was a humanitarian mission , there was no political aspect to it whatsoever			0
the @entity4 government has no jurisdiction here and the @entity14 government has made clear that she can not be extradited			0
' horrifying : a teenage girl is shown chained to a bench in the shocking footage captured from inside the orphanage distressed : princess @entity67 wipes tears from her eyes after witnessing what was happening in the orphanage when she went round with her mother ' @entity8 is saddened that the @entity4 government 's actions are being allowed to overshadow a legitimate journalistic investigation into the appalling conditions in state - run orphanages in @entity4			1
' during the tonight documentary , @entity0 and @entity79 : their secret mission , @entity8 disguised herself with a black wig and a headscarf to visit an orphanage near @entity22			0
undercover footage appeared to show a number of disabled inmates had been tied to their beds by staff unable to cope with them			0
others were fed lying down or confined to cots without proper care			0
the day after the broadcast , however , the @entity4 authorities accused the @entity0 of taking part in a politically motivated campaign against their country and of deliberately trying to derail their bid to join the @entity102			0
documentary team : @entity104 with @entity8 and daughter @entity105 in @entity4 during the filming warm embrace : @entity0 of @entity1 was filmed giving an orphaned child a cuddle during filming of the documentary @entity112 , @entity4 's minister responsible for child protection , said : ' it was known that this @entity8 was against @entity4 's @entity102 bid			1
' foreign minister @entity115 also criticised the use of hidden cameras , claiming it was ' a breach of privacy '			1
the following year , acting at the behest of @entity4 authorities , officers from @entity121 presented letters to the @entity0 's lawyer and to two @entity9 journalists demanding they co-operate with their enquiries into the incident			1
at the time a @entity30 spokesman said : ' it is not our usual policy to comment on individual cases			1
however , the @entity30 can confirm it has received a formal request for mutual legal assistance concerning @entity8 , @entity8			1
' @entity121 said letters had been sent to the three ' in order to organise for the collection of information sought by the @entity4 authorities '			0
royal team : @entity8 and daughters @entity105 , left , and @entity67 , right , travelled to @entity4 together to make the undercover documentary for @entity9 @entity14 has an extradition deal with @entity4 under the 1957 @entity145			0
a suspect can be extradited if accused of an offence which is punishable in both @entity4 and @entity14 by at least one year in prison			0
but it is unlikely that any attempt to extradite the @entity151 would succeed - encouraging news for her as @entity4 jails are known for their harsh conditions			0
last night a @entity30 source said : ' as it stands , she will not be extradited			1
the @entity4 authorities have no power to do so			0
' a spokesman for the department confirmed : ' a judge is required to refuse an extradition request if there is no equivalent offence in @entity14 law			0

they say she ' violated ' children 's privacy
she was told by @entity30 the case was closed
