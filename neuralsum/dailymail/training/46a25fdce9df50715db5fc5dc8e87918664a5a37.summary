the @entity0 are cashing in on a @entity1 on home soil by bringing out six different @entity4 shirts in little more than 15 months			1
the rampant commercialism prevalent at @entity6 saw @entity4 kit suppliers @entity8 launch two shirts , which featured the controversial @entity11 motif , last september			1
these will be followed on to the market by another two @entity1 shirts before the start of the tournament in september			1
and then there will be another double kit launch by @entity4 ahead of the 2016 @entity19			2
@entity4 players wear an @entity4 rugby home kit released last year , which caused controversy over its design shadow minister for sport @entity24 said last night : ‘ merchandising is an important part of sport but governing bodies must be responsible and help fans and parents by showing restraint			1
’ the @entity0 say the extra shirts , which start at £ 50 and go up to £ 90.99 for an exact replica , are being brought out because @entity4 can not have sponsors 02 on their jersey during the @entity1 — and the @entity8 deal is for two new strips per season			1
but there was public unrest when @entity41 brought out four @entity4 football kits in less than a year to take advantage of the @entity44			1
and rugby fans are being asked to fork out for even more changes of strip in a similar period			0
@entity4 's players model an alternative red kit they wore last year , with a @entity11 design on the top half an @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ we have brought out one new home and alternate strip each season for the last five years , as is normal across the sports industry			1
the prices have remained unchanged for three years and every penny made is invested back into the game			0
’ the @entity0 signed a four - year kit deal with @entity8 , understood to be worth more than £ 5million a year , in march 2012 when @entity4 ’s rugby stock was at rock bottom after the @entity65 debacle in @entity66			1
the surprisingly big @entity8 offer allowed the @entity0 to reject @entity41 ’s reduced renewal terms			1
the @entity0 signed a four - year kit deal with @entity8 in 2012 , producing a succession of kits for the @entity4 @entity72 are understood to be arranging the recruitment of the @entity75 ’s new chief executive at a significantly reduced fee			1
this is because the @entity75 board ’s nominations panel are prepared to do some of the work themselves , with chairman @entity82 making it known at the start of the process that he could n’t see the need to hire a recruitment agency as the directors themselves could come up with a strong short - list to replace @entity90			2
@entity75 concerns about any perceived cronyism in the appointment led to @entity94 belatedly coming on board			0
former @entity4 hooker @entity99 ’s obscene speech at last year ’s rugby writers ’ awards dinner — described as an all - time low in the organisation ’s 55 - year history — has also sadly sounded the death knell for guest speakers at the bash			1
the revamped , sanitised version at the @entity106 had a brief gushing question and answer session with @entity109 instead			0
but that was no replacement for an after - dinner speaker — indeed , part of the event ’s charm was anticipating how awful the speech might be			0
@entity4 manager @entity117 was at @entity118 on tuesday night to watch the @entity120 action the dinner @entity117 sought to arrange with his @entity4 players during the long gap between internationals was due to be held at @entity125			0
but as there were no gaps in the crowded football calendar , the date has been scrapped and the senior @entity4 side have once again side - stepped attending a venue that is meant to be their headquarters			0
@entity133 , who has shown little or no interest in sport since becoming @entity136 , is nonetheless said to have been influential in the government turning down @entity139 amendments to the @entity140 that would have greatly helped regulate ticket touts in time for the @entity1			1
@entity133 has spoken previously about his enthusiastic support for the secondary ticket market			0
@entity144 , who led the @entity139 campaign , said : ‘ every day the list of victims of crime grows as a result of inadequate regulation of the secondary market			0
‘ we will explore every way of protecting sports fans over the action of touts when the bill comes back to the @entity139			0
’ @entity159 , looking over @entity158 , is set to become president of the @entity161 any opposition to dictatorial @entity159 becoming president of the @entity161 evaporated at a meeting of the first - class counties who unanimously recommended a change of statute that will allow @entity159 to deal with @entity169 issues in this new role			0
@entity172 ’s @entity171 is certain to take over as chairman with an extended five - year term			2
but still to be worked out is how long @entity159 can stay on as president without becoming a loose cannon			0
@entity178 ’ move to the @entity179 in @entity180 looks to have got under the skin of @entity182 , the best supported rugby club in the @entity183			0
the @entity182 have been so exercised that they have booked giant billboard space at the entrance to @entity178 ’ new home to promote their long established history at the other end of the @entity189			2
wasps have settled into their new home , the @entity179 in @entity180 , with two consecutive wins the exodus of @entity195 rugby players across the @entity196 is at least balanced by legendary @entity199 flanker @entity198 ’s decision to settle in @entity200 , west @entity201			2
the 40 - year - old , who won 63 caps during a stellar 16 - year career with @entity205 and @entity178 , is gaining his training badges and intends to set up a rugby academy in his name .			2

the @entity1 is *hosted* on home soil this year from september
the new strips start at £ 50 and go up to £ 90.99 for an exact replica
@entity8 will release the two new shirts in time for the @entity1
