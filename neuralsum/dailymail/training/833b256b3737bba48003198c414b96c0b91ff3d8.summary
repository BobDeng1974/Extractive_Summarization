eating 40 per cent less food could extend a person 's life by 20 years , according to scientists			1
researchers at the @entity5 at @entity6 are developing a treatment they hope will combat the ' disease ' of getting older			1
they are looking into how genetics and lifestyle can be adapted to offset the effects of ageing and add years , possibly decades , to a person 's life			1
incentive : eating 40 per cent less food could extend a person 's life by 20 years , according to scientists age - related diseases such as cardiovascular disease , cancer and neurodegeneration can also be combated , it is claimed			1
one line of inquiry that the team is developing is how the life of a rat can be increased by up to 30 per cent simply by reducing its food intake			2
lead researcher dr @entity29 told the @entity30 : ' if you reduce the diet of a rat by 40 per cent it will live for 20 or 30 per cent longer			2
so we would be talking 20 years of human life			0
this has shown on all sorts of organisms , even labradors			0
' the scientists are also studying fruit flies , which share 60 per cent of human genes and age in a similar manner , and mice			1
they have already prolonged the healthy lifespan in both flies and mice by using drug treatments and a modified diet			0
it is hoped that this combination will also work to extend human life			0
dr @entity29 said : ' if we discover the genes involved with ageing , we should be able to delay ageing itself			1
this is what we 've found			0
' he added that his team has extended the life of organisms by mutating single genes			0
the researchers have also lessen the effects of a mutation which can cause @entity67 's			1
however , dr @entity29 cautioned that the field of research into extending life is only a decade old , so remains ' theoretical '			0
it is their unique approach to treating all age - related diseases as being caused by the ' disease ' of ageing itself that sets their research apart , he said			2
the research is being displayed at the @entity82 in @entity83 .			0
