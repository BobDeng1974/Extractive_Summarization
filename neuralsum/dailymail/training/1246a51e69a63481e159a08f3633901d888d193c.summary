@entity0 attracts around one million visitors each year and now archaeologists have revealed that it was ‘ the @entity4 ’ – and even had an ancient ‘ visitor ’s centre ’			1
ancient @entity6 from far and wide were drawn to @entity0 to see the area ’s pink flint and the @entity9 acted as an ‘ a-road ’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at @entity13 where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built , one archaeologist has claimed			1
it is now thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats			1
an ancient tourist attraction : ancient @entity6 from far and wide were drawn to @entity0 to see the area ¿ s pink flint and the @entity9 acted as an ' a-road ' carrying people to the location where feasts and tour guides were available , one archaeologist has claimed it had long been thought @entity31 in @entity32 was the oldest continuous settlement in the @entity34 , but researchers have now bestowed the title on @entity37 in @entity38			1
the location is home to @entity0 and now holds the claim of being the birthplace of history in @entity34 - an honour confirmed by the @entity45			2
it is thought the settlement dates back more than 10 millennia to @entity49			0
@entity50 of the @entity51 said : ' the area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away , and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at @entity0 itself			2
the first monuments at @entity0 were built by these people ' carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at @entity64 , @entity13 - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that @entity37 is the oldest settlement in @entity34 and has been continually occupied since @entity49			1
archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that @entity0 was built as part of an established settlement , rather than a monument in an empty landscape			1
they have also ruled out the possibility of the monument being built by @entity79 immigrants and think the giant stones were placed by indigenous hunters and homemakers			0
the team found that mesolithic cultures cleared land around @entity13 between 7,500 and @entity86 , which they had thought was an activity previously thought to be a part of the ‘ farming package ’ brought in by @entity93 immigrants from the continent in the 5th millennium @entity96 main attraction : before @entity0 was built there was a settlement on @entity13 and people used the @entity9 to access the community from the east and west ( pictured ) , which is thought to have erected the famous stone monument archaeologists also recovered the largest haul of @entity106 worked flints ( some pictured ) across the @entity106 period ever found			1
a total of 31,000 were discovered in an area measuring 52ft ( 16 square metres ) 2,000 of which were concentrated in just a metre squared the persistent use of the site for nearly 3,000 years and the fact that many of the tools found were for domestic purposes rather than hunting ones also points to the fact that people were settling there			2
previously it was thought that there were n’t any settlers until @entity93 times			0
@entity50 , research fellow in archaeology at the @entity51 , who led the dig , said that the site ‘ provides evidence for people staying put , clearing land , building , and presumably worshipping , monuments			0
‘ the area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away , and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at @entity0 itself			2
the first monuments at @entity0 were built by these people			2
carbon dating from an archaeological dig has found the parish of @entity37 in @entity38 has been continually occupied for every millennia since @entity49 - making it the oldest settlement in the @entity34			1
these pieces of flint were found at the site on @entity150 , @entity13 - a mile - and - a - half from @entity0 historic : the dig in @entity37 , which took place in october and was funded by the @entity51 , also unearthed the largest haul of worked flints from the @entity106 period experts from the @entity51 claim the new findings dismiss previous theories that @entity37 , marked at @entity160 , was conceived by @entity79 immigrants			1
' in effect , @entity13 ( near the settlement ) was the very first @entity164 , up and running in the 8th millennium @entity96 , ' one archaeologist said ‘ in effect , @entity13 was the very first @entity164 , up and running in the 8th millennium @entity96 @entity168 would have been the @entity169 – people would have come down on their log boats			2
‘ they would have had the equivalent of tour guides and there would have been feasting			0
’ the settlement was confirmed using carbon dating on bones that belonged to aurochs - animals once twice the size of bulls , illustration pictured the team of archaeologists found remains of big game animals and a large amount of burnt flint from their feasting fires as well as tools that suggest people travelled to the site from the east and west			1
‘ another possible reason why people were attracted to the area was the striking bright pink colouring of the flint , which is n’t that colour anywhere else in the country , ’ he said			0
the pink colour of the flint was caused by @entity205 rivularis algae and is due to a combination of dappled light and the unusually warm spring water in the area			0
dr @entity50 said : ‘ it ’s unique to have people of that time come from so many different faraway places			0
the site and the @entity0 areas were very well known places to visit for a very long time – the @entity218 of the @entity106			0
’ archaeologists also recovered the largest haul of @entity106 worked flints across the @entity106 period ever found			0
a total of 31,000 were discovered in an area measuring 52ft ( 16 square metres ) 2,000 of which were concentrated in just a metre squared .			0

@entity6 travelled from far and wide to see pink flint , have feasts and tours of the area surrounding @entity0 , one archaeologist claims
experts at the @entity51 carbon dated bones to prove that indigenous people lived around the monument before they built it
@entity37 is the oldest settlement in @entity34 and has been continually occupied since @entity49
over 31,000 flint tools were discovered at @entity64 , @entity13 - around one mile from @entity0 - which proves it was a ' visitor *'s* centre '
