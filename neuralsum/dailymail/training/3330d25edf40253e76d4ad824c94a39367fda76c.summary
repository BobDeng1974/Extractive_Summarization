it is a remarkable fact that the difference in time between when the @entity2 and @entity3 roamed the @entity4 is greater than the distance in time between the @entity3 and today			1
and now one man has created an ingenious infographic to show the evolution of these dinosaurs in all their incredible diversity			1
the unusual circular diagram details the rise and fall of the @entity13 from its appearance in the early @entity15 , 231 million years ago , to its virtual total extinction at the end of the @entity18 period 66 million years ago			1
hover your mouse over the image below to read the infographic in detail the infographic covers the rise and fall of @entity13 , as shown on this timeline			2
dinosaurs are thought to have been wiped out by a massive asteroid impact that created a dust cloud capable of blocking out sunlight for a year			2
it also released acidic gasses into the atmosphere , known as the @entity35 extinction event dinosaurs are thought to have been wiped out by a massive asteroid impact			1
this impact created a dust cloud capable of blocking out sunlight for a year , as well as releasing acidic gasses into the atmosphere , commonly known as the @entity35 extinction event			1
three quarters of plant and animal life on @entity4 was annihilated , and the only dinosaurs to survive were those of the clade @entity48 , which evolved into what we know today as birds			2
graphic designer @entity52 , 36 , took a staggering 180 hours to create his dinosaur family tree , based upon research from the @entity55 , the @entity56 and the @entity57			1
the design is known as a phylogenetic tree and @entity52 ’s creation starts in the centre from which the timeline and epochs radiate			1
@entity64 first appeared in the early @entity15 , 231 million years ago ( illustrated ) the circular diagram details the rise and fall of the @entity13 from its appearance in the early @entity15 , 231 million years ago , to its virtual total extinction at the end of the @entity18 period 66 million years ago later therapods on the poster include the most well - known large carnivorous dinosaurs including @entity3 ( pictured ) @entity73 and @entity74 graphic designer @entity52 , 36 , took a staggering 180 hours to create his dinosaur family tree			1
these are the dinosaurs included on it he chose this design to make it easy to see the wide range of dinosaur shapes and sizes that evolved around the later period of the tree – the @entity18 – which is coloured in blue			1
the dinosaurs featured on the tree are ordered in size from the smallest to the largest and while they are in proportion , they are different scales as the creatures ranged from between 1.9ft ( 60cm ) and 85ft ( 26 metres ) , which is impossible to fit on a tree , according to the designer			1
‘ there are obviously hundreds of distinct dinosaur species , and the selection on the poster was chosen to offer as wide representation of the differing forms and sizes at different points in time as possible , ’ @entity52 told @entity93			1
the creature at the centre of the tree is @entity104 , an archosauriform			0
the archosaur group eventually evolved into dinosaurs , so this creature marks the beginning of the family tree			2
it then splits into two branches – one for saurischian dinosaurs and the other being ornithischian dinosaurs			2
the distinction is based upon their differing hip structure			2
saurischian dinosaurs had hips like a lizard , whereas ornithischian dinosaurs had hips more like modern birds , with a pubic bone pointing downwards towards their tails			2
this is a little confusing as modern birds evolved from the saurischia			0
an early member of the group saurischia was @entity129 - a small carnivorous beast that walked on two feet and measured 6.5ft ( two metres ) long			2
the design is known as a phylogenetic tree and @entity52 's creation starts in the centre from which the timeline and epochs radiate sauropods such as @entity138 ( pictured ) and @entity139 are included in the family tree as well as @entity141 and @entity142 ( formerly known as @entity142 ) this clade - a group of organisms consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants - included the largest land animals that have ever existed , the later members of which are known as titanosaurs			1
sauropods such as @entity138 and @entity139 are included in the family tree as well as @entity141 and @entity142 ( formerly known as @entity142 )			0
however , it also evolved in a different direction too , to include therapods , which were mainly carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs			2
early therapods were quite small , such as @entity157 at 9.8ft ( three metres ) long , and @entity158 at 19.6ft ( six metres )			2
later therapods include the most well - known large carnivorous dinosaurs including @entity3 , @entity73 and @entity74			0
early therapods were quite small , such as @entity157 ( pictured ) at 9.8ft ( three metres ) long and @entity158 at 16.9ft ( six metres ) shown on the right - hand side of the infographic , most herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs evolved hard beaks			1
one of the earliest was @entity165 which was around 3.2ft ( one metre ) long @entity48 - which evolved into modern birds - and coelurosauria - which include the @entity3 - are both parts of a clade known as avetherapoda			0
@entity48 then branched off and is represented on the chart by @entity173 – a feathered flying dinosaur around the size of a modern raven			0
most herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs , which are shown on the right - hand side of the graphic , evolved hard beaks			1
one of the earliest was @entity165 , which was around 3.3ft ( one metre ) long			0
like various other dinosaurs ( including the @entity157 on the graphic ) , @entity165 is thought to have been at least partially feathered based on the recovered fossils			1
a group of dinosaurs known as ‘ shield bearers ’ because of their armoured skin , evolved into the group stegosauria – represented by @entity2 in the infographic – and ankylosauria			0
they all had very small brains considering their size			0
the brain of stegosaurus was around the same size as a modern dog ’s , despite that fact the dinosaur was 29.5ft ( nine metres ) long			0
meanwhile , non-armoured dinosaurs called ornithopoda – represented by @entity202 and @entity203 – evolved an effective jaw structure for chewing grass , and grazed on plains			0
another group called ceratopsia , which included @entity209 , existed towards the end of the @entity18 period alongside therapod predators such as the @entity3 and @entity73			0
the final group shown on the infographic is pachycephalosauria represented by a dinosaur called @entity216			0
the dinosaur was bipedal with a heavily armoured body and spiky horns , which it probably used to head - butt predators			0
a group of dinosaurs known as ' shield bearers ' because of their armoured skin , evolved into the group stegosauria - represented by @entity2 in the infographic ( pictured ) - and ankylosauria			0
they all had very small brains considering their size each dinosaur , such as this @entity202 , took between six and eight hours to draw using @entity233 and are based on the most up - to - date thinking about how dinosaurs looked - particularly the feathered ones the only known species of @entity216 is @entity216 , which was named by children because it resembles the fictional dragons in @entity240			1
there is a lot of information packed into one infographic , which is available as a poster from @entity52 ’s graphic design company @entity246 for £ 25			1
each dinosaur took between six and eight hours to draw using @entity233 and they are based on the most up - to - date thinking about how dinosaurs looked – particularly the feathered ones ‘ the colours are a tiny bit more playful , as it 's pretty obvious that there 's no way anyone could have truly accurate evidence of that kind , ’ @entity52 explained			1
he decided to make such detailed posters for children and adults alike after his two - year - old daughter asked him what a hydrothermal vent is			0
‘ i realised that kids are just like information sponges - if you present them with interesting things in a bright , clear and fun format , they absorb it so easily			0
’ having studied biochemistry and the history of science at university , @entity52 , of @entity274 in @entity275 , set to work creating accurate posters from dinosaurs to space shuttles			1
‘ i think the subject of dinosaurs is one of those amazing entry points into the wonders of natural science in that they 're so bizarre and otherworldly that they captivate young minds , ' he said			1
he plans on creating more posters about science , technology , engineering and maths as well as a series of illustrated books in which a chimp character called professor @entity297 will tackle quantum physics for the under - fives			0
the final group shown on the infographic is pachycephalosauria represented by a dinosaur called @entity216			0
the dinosaur was bipedal with a heavily armoured body and spiky horns			0
the only known species is @entity216 ( pictured ) , named by children because it resembles fictional dragons in @entity240			0

designer @entity52 spent 180 hours creating his evolution graphic
it covers 165 million years from the early @entity15 to the @entity35 extinction event
illustrations are based on the latest thinking about dinosaur appearance
the selection of dinosaurs was chosen to offer as wide a representation of evolution at different points in time as possible
