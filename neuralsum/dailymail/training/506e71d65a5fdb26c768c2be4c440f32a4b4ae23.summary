by @entity0 male boxers at the @entity2 in @entity3 will not wear head guards for the first time since 1982 , with experts claiming it is actually safer for the athletes ’ health			1
head guards have been used at all international amateur competitions since they were introduced before the 1984 @entity11 in @entity12 , but research has shown they actually increased the number of head injuries			1
women ’s boxing , however , which makes its @entity2 debut in @entity3 , will continue to use head guards , as not enough research has been done in the relatively new sport for the same change to be made			1
gone : male boxers will not wear head guards at the @entity2 for the first time in 32 years doctor @entity25 of the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) has worked with @entity27 since 1997 and believes the rule change is a ‘ positive development ’			1
he said : ‘ evidence has found that , when they introduced head guards in 1984 , the number of head injuries increased			2
the number has actually decreased since head guards have been removed			2
‘ the style of boxing has changed a little bit because the boxers ’ heads are not getting quite so close and i think it ’s made it a bit more interesting to watch			0
it ’s a positive development			0
‘ the boxing ’s better without the head guards and it ’s reducing the number of head injuries , which is low in this sport anyway			2
’ dangerous : experts says that head guards actually increase the risk of injury for amateur boxers dr @entity25 said the number of concussions are lower without a head guard primarily because boxers do not feel so confident and therefore take fewer risks with their bodies			1
he told @entity61 : ‘ when you have a head guard on you are more likely to get an injury			0
‘ there are several reasons for this : it could be that head guards restrict your vision slightly , so you do n’t see the punches coming , and maybe that the head guard increases the size of the head so you get more rotational force ( when you are hit )			0
‘ the referees also ca n’t see the boxers so clearly , so they ca n’t see when they ’re in trouble			0
‘ but the most likely reason is people just feel more confident with a head guard on			0
they do n’t put their head in a position where it ca n’t get hit			0
that ’s the most persuasive argument for me			0
’ the men will also fight under a pro-style 10 - point scoring system as part of rule changes by the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) last year			1
new : women 's boxing will be at the @entity2 for the first time at @entity93 suited up : female boxers like @entity96 's @entity95 ( pictured ) will still wear head guards			1

male boxers have worn head guards since the 1982 @entity2
experts say they actually increase the risk of injury , not decrease it
females will wear guards as women 's boxing makes debut at @entity93
they were introduced to all amateur competitions before 1984 @entity113
