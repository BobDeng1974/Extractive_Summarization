by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is aiming to break @entity4 's losing streak over @entity5 - but is expecting a tough challenge from a side still likely to play the ' @entity9 ' way			1
former manager @entity9 left @entity10 less than 48 hours before the start of the new @entity13 season , with @entity14 taking charge of saturday 's narrow 2 - 1 defeat at @entity17			1
with the furore surrounding @entity21 's ongoing wranglings with former club @entity22 , the @entity18 will no longer be filling the vacancy			0
hoodoo : @entity4 manager @entity2 is all too aware of his team 's recent poor form against saturday 's opponents @entity5			1
the @entity5 are unbeaten since 2003 in fixtures between the sides still in charge : @entity14 is once again likely to take charge of @entity5 for the match at @entity34 that means @entity14 is once again likely to be in charge of first - team affairs for the visit of @entity4 - with the @entity5 having won four of the last six meetings and remaining unbeaten in the fixture since 2003			1
but @entity2 , who is struggling with early season injuries and suspension to his defensive line , is hopeful of overcoming their recent south @entity46 hoodoo			2
' i think they have some better players than last season but they very much stick to the same type of structural organisation , ' he said			0
' we did n't beat them last year and it will be just as difficult , if not more so , with the players they 've brought in			0
' the new players have lots of @entity13 experience and from that point of view we 'll have a tough job			0
' there 's still lots of excitement around the ground and the stadium , the players know their position now , they know what their job is			0
at the start of last season they found it difficult to cope with the league , but @entity9 came in and structured it accordingly			2
defeated : @entity5 lost their opening match 2 - 1 against @entity17 , despite @entity80 's headed opener late agony : @entity4 lost out to a stoppage time @entity84 goal in their opening fixture ' it 'll be a tight game			1
i do n't think there 'll be many goals in it , but hopefully it 'll be as entertaining as it possibly can be			0
' the @entity4 slipped to two 1 - 0 defeats at the hands of @entity5 last season and went on to finish two places lower than the @entity5 ' final position of 11th			1
with debutants @entity99 and @entity101 impressing in the last - gasp defeat to @entity84 last week , @entity2 could hand either @entity103 or @entity104 their first starts for the club on saturday			1
but , after bolstering his attacking options over the summer , it is in defence where @entity2 will be weakened - with @entity110 banned and @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 unlikely to be completely match fit			2
first start ? summer signing @entity103 could make his first appearance in the @entity4 starting xi new boy : @entity104 could also be handed his first start for @entity4 at @entity34 @entity119 international @entity112 is hoping the managerial uncertainty can see the @entity4 turn the tables this season			1
' @entity5 did a number on us twice last year , so we want to get one back , ' he said			2
' in that first year in the @entity13 you might wonder what to expect from them , but now everyone knows their players and the situations they create			0
we know what to expect this year			0
' i do n't know whether the managerial situation there will affect the players			0
i watched their game against @entity17 last week and they played really well - they were unlucky to lose the game , so it 's a home game for them , their fans will be up for the first home game of the season and we 'll have to play at our best			1
' revenge : @entity112 is determined to get back at @entity5 following two losses to them last season			0

@entity5 have won four of their last six meetings with @entity4
the two teams meet at @entity34 on saturday
@entity2 is expecting a tough challenge from side that play ' @entity9 ' way
@entity14 again expected to take charge for @entity5
*hammers* beaten late on by @entity84 in their opening game
@entity5 also suffered late *heartbreak* , against @entity17
