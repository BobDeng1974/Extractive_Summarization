in the past 16 months , @entity0 has been shunned by @entity1 and then dropped by @entity2			1
any suggestion that the mild - mannered forward might throw in the towel , however , has been a definite non-starter			2
deemed unsuitable for @entity8 ’s favoured high - energy 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system , a conciliatory @entity0 vowed that if he could n’t change his game he would certainly bust a gut to try to improve it			1
@entity2 striker @entity0 talks to @entity1 boss @entity8 on the touchline on wednesday then , left out by @entity12 for @entity2 ’s @entity14 goalless draw against @entity15 at @entity16 earlier this month , the 25 - year - old again elected to keep his counsel			1
in an era when young millionaires are n’t slow to sound off about their perceived woes , the £ 8million man ’s riposte was delivered silently on the park			0
a winning goal in his first game back against @entity27 was followed up by a deadly double at @entity29 the following week			0
it led to a £ 10m bid for his services from @entity34 , swiftly booted out by @entity2 owners @entity36 two weeks ago			1
@entity37 , the former @entity2 and @entity1 striker , is a big fan of @entity0 but admits there were times he feared there might be parallels between the hitman and @entity43			1
@entity0 ( left ) challenges @entity45 's @entity44 during the 1 - 0 victory @entity43 may have been the finest goal - grabber @entity1 has produced in recent years , but the flaws in his overall game limited him to just 18 international caps and seven goals for his country			1
@entity37 has been impressed , however , to see @entity53 show a fighting quality to match his efficiency in front of the net			0
the boy seemingly without a temper has rolled up his sleeves and scrapped it out to win his first @entity1 call - up since november 2013			1
@entity37 now feels @entity0 could be a key player on sunday against whipping boys @entity64 in a @entity66 qualifying group where goal difference could prove decisive			1
‘ @entity0 ’s not egotistical			2
he would n’t spit the dummy , ’ said @entity37			0
‘ but he ’ s a real predator			0
even though it ’s not been his best season he ’s still got 16 goals this season for @entity2			1
@entity0 in action during his last @entity1 call - up which was back in november 2013 ‘ we had someone like that before in @entity43			1
but for some reason @entity43 never got the opportunity at national level to get many caps and many goals			2
@entity0 had seemed to be going along similar lines			2
but he ’s up for the battle			0
he ’s proven that at @entity2 , where he has found it difficult this season			1
he ’s been in and out of the side			0
but he came back in and got a few goals and put pressure on the manager			2
‘ i know he ’s elated to be back in the @entity1 squad for the @entity45 and @entity64 games and he ’ll be looking to start			1
he ’s got to take his chance when it comes			0
since @entity94 and @entity45 have both taken seven off @entity64 , i ’ ve a feeling this group is going to come down to goal difference – and @entity98 can certainly score goals			1
’ @entity37 recalls @entity53 facing a tough baptism of fire at @entity2 where fans viewed him as a striker proven only in the lower tiers of @entity104 football with @entity105			1
but if ever a pedigree for scoring against mediocre opposition comes in handy , it ’s against a @entity64 team so new on the scene they have no @entity113 ranking			2
@entity0 , in action against @entity45 , will hope to feature in sunday 's contest with @entity64 ‘ @entity0 was scoring 20 - plus goals a season but people questioned him when @entity2 bought him for £ 8million , ’ said @entity37 , now 48			1
‘ he was n’t tried and tested in the @entity119			0
i do think people worry because he had n’t played and scored at the highest level			2
and maybe that ’ s in the back of your mind as a manager			0
‘ but it ’s up to @entity98 to keep his head down – as he does – and to work hard and score goals			2
his game is all about goalscoring but at international level you need to do that tiny little bit extra if you want to succeed			0
but that ’s what @entity0 ’s been working hard at			2
he ’s shown he will try his best to do what it takes to get back in			0
’ by a quirk of fate , the last time @entity1 reached a major finals , @entity2 striker @entity37 ’s goals secured @entity143 ’s team a place at the @entity145 in @entity146			1
and his @entity148 team - mate @entity147 led the team out against @entity150 in the opening match in @entity152			0
@entity0 ( right ) , who has been in impressive club form , celebrates with @entity2 team - mate @entity154 in 2015 , @entity0 and his @entity148 captain @entity155 both find themselves in the squad as @entity1 hope to end their international exile by reaching the @entity160 , also in @entity146 , next year			1
@entity37 believes @entity155 has a head start on @entity147 but has the potential to be compared favourably to the man who in his prime was known as @entity165			0
‘ @entity155 is young and has still got one or two mistakes in him			0
but if he keeps working hard it ’s natural he will be compared with @entity147 because they are both @entity1 and @entity2 defenders			1
‘ but what i would remind @entity155 is that @entity147 was n’t the perfect player at 23			0
@entity147 was a late developer at national level and @entity155 is away ahead of @entity147 for his age			0
the older , the more caps , and the more experience @entity155 gets will make him an even better player			0
‘ i loved going to major finals as a player and i ’d like to do it with the @entity180			0
@entity155 and @entity0 can help that happen			2

the striker has been dropped by @entity2 and @entity1 in past 16 months
25 - year - old has scored 16 goals for @entity2 so far this season
@entity0 last earned a call - up for @entity1 in november 2013
@entity1 faces @entity64 in a @entity191 qualifier on sunday
