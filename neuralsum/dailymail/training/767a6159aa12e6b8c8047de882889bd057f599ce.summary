@entity0 and his wife @entity1 own a £ 25million house in @entity3 , and the @entity5 footballer claimed the planned mansion tax is unfair @entity0 had the details of his property portfolio read out to him on television by a @entity11 frontbencher , in the latest row over the mansion tax			1
the @entity5 footballer claimed @entity15 ’s plan to levy a tax on homes worth more than £ 2million was ‘ unfair ’ and intended to ‘ punish ’ people who had done well			1
he was filmed walking around his lavish home in @entity20 ’s @entity3 , making an espresso , explaining that he had paid all his income tax and stamp duty and never used offshore tax havens			2
mr @entity0 argued that instead of taxing property , @entity11 should press companies such as @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , who were shamed for avoiding tax , to pay their fair share			1
but he was attacked by @entity11 ’s @entity33 , who told him : ‘ this is nonsense ’			2
he added that people who were struggling ‘ will have zero sympathy with millionaires like you pleading poverty ’			1
the shadow @entity41 secretary then read out a list of all the footballer ’s properties while the pair were guests on @entity49 ’s @entity48 , although mr @entity0 disputed some of the details			1
‘ i looked you up before coming here and i see you ’ve got a £ 25million house in @entity3 that you ’ve just put up for sale , you ’ve got a big country pile in @entity58 and another flat in @entity3 ’ , the @entity11 mp said			1
‘ and i also saw that the place you ’ve got in @entity61 [ his home in @entity3 ] , you were renting out for £ 75,000 a month ’			0
mr @entity0 , 40 , did not dispute the first two properties but said the rental of his home ‘ did n’t happen ’			0
mr @entity33 added : ‘ well you can tell me whether the others are right but we are talking about £ 3,000 a year extra that you would pay for a £ 2million to £ 3million property			2
’ the footballer said people who could be hit by the tax include families who bought a home in @entity74 in north @entity20 for £ 300,000 some years ago and have seen it soar in value			1
he added that properties in @entity58 and the suburbs of @entity79 were ‘ a long way away from @entity20 and oligarchs ’			2
in his pre-recorded film , shown before he appeared on the show , he said : ‘ an @entity85 ’s home is his castle but under @entity11 ’s proposal for a mansion tax that castle is under threat			1
mr @entity0 said he felt politicians should be pursuing companies who avoid paying tax instead the former @entity85 footballer told @entity95 he was being punished for investing in property ‘ @entity11 ’s plans hit those properties valued at over £ 2million will penalise those individuals who have done well for themselves			1
@entity15 keeps banging on about fairness in society but this tax is anything but fair			0
' over the years i ’ve paid millions in income tax and stamp duty but i ’m punished for investing in a property portfolio			0
‘ i do n’t rely on offshore tax havens and i do n’t want to invest in stocks and shares … i see this as a tax on aspiration			0
@entity11 would be better off targeting companies like @entity27 , @entity29 , @entity28 , making them pay a fairer level of tax rather than picking on people like me who have already paid their dues ten times over			2

he said the costs of implementing it meant it would not raise the £ 1.3billion intended and claimed the £ 2million threshold may have to drop			0
mr @entity0 is married to @entity145 heiress @entity125			0
as a defender for @entity147 and @entity148 , until he retired in 2011 , he used to earn £ 100,000 a week			0
