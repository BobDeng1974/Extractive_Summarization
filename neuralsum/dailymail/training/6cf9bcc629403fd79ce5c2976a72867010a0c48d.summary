the reply from @entity1 is emphatic			1
would he have played like @entity4 did at the @entity3 ? ‘ no , i would not , ’ he says			1
there is no room for doubt			0
it is clear that one of the world ’s finest ever footballers is less than impressed with @entity13 ’s current manager			1
it might have passed some by in @entity16 , but while @entity19 ’s @entity18 team marched on to the @entity3 semi-finals in @entity21 last summer , with their coach lauded in this country as a tactical genius , back home in @entity18 his old rival @entity1 was criticising the directness of the play , the lack of passing and the absence of the @entity32 signature on their game			1
‘ the result is perfect , ’ @entity1 does concede , for no - one had @entity18 down as semi-finalists prior to the tournament			1
‘ that ’s what they needed to do			0
but you can talk about other things , the quality that the team had			0
a lot of times it ’s a question of survival			2
i did n’t see the football that i would like			2
when it is put to him that playing that way with the current @entity32 team might have resulted in an earlier exit , he shrugs			2
‘ everybody is like he is , ’ says @entity1			1
it is a curious dynamic in @entity32 football , these two giant figures bestriding the stage with their respective factions			1
in @entity18 , you are either with @entity19 or @entity1			1
@entity1 was the great player — for most people , among the best ever , alongside @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			1
even now you can feel the reverence in which @entity1 is held			2
last week he was at @entity85 playing at the @entity86 , the @entity88 event which uniquely pairs up celebrities with professional golfers			0
in the course - side hotel in which he is staying , man of the moment @entity92 has just breezed through			2
@entity1 , though his own finest moments were mainly 40 years ago , is afforded similar deference by fans and staff			2
@entity19 , by contrast , is the grafter			1
no more than average as a player , he forged a managerial career from the grass roots up to the @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity109 titles while @entity1 , the superstar , was parachuted into the top jobs			1
@entity1 , unlike most greats , was a success as a manager , winning @entity114 ’s first ever @entity106 in 1992			1
but since he left that job he has barely coached and yet remains probably the most influential figure in world football			2
his tactics , and those of his mentor , @entity120 , of incessant passing and pressing , constant attacking and an almost obsessive desire to create , have transformed the game			2
@entity1 criticises the style of @entity19 's @entity18 side at the @entity3 : ' i did n’t see the football that i would like ’ @entity1 concedes @entity18 's effort in making the semi-final in @entity21 was beyond expectations for the team @entity132 is his best - known disciple and his @entity114 team of 2008 - 2012 were the best exponents of the craft			1
closer to home , @entity136 and @entity137 are also clear followers			1
in fact , @entity1 would feel more at home with the playing style of @entity13 ’s sunday opponents , @entity143 , than the tactics of his compatriot			1
‘ @entity143 try to dominate the ball			2
if you have the ball , you decide what is going to happen			0
’ @entity143 and @entity151 , it seems , come closest to executing the principles he forged			1
‘ i think so , ’ he says			2
the intensity of the @entity19 - @entity155 split does seem curious			1
all @entity32 teams , including @entity19 ’s , pass the ball exceptionally well			1
both coaches have a penchant for the back three and for attacking football			0
they grew up in neighbouring @entity163 suburbs and played at @entity164 where @entity19 , who played in @entity1 ’s position , left because he could n’t establish himself in the first team			1
@entity19 then followed @entity1 as coach at @entity114 in the 90s , providing the link to @entity132			1
@entity1 speaks during the @entity86 at @entity85 the former @entity18 , @entity164 and @entity114 superstar hits off the tee on september 30 @entity1 speaks with former @entity114 and @entity173 legend @entity172 at @entity85 if there was a decisive battle that symbolises the struggle between the two dominant figures in @entity32 football it came in 2011 , when @entity19 was made managing director at @entity164 , a move which @entity1 , despite being a board member , was not consulted over			1
@entity1 went to court to ensure @entity19 never took up his post , arguing that the board needed to consult all directors before making the appointment			1
the differences are minuscule but fiercely debated within the faith			0
and if it is a civil war , then @entity1 is the cavalier and @entity19 the roundhead			1
for @entity1 ’s taste , @entity19 ’s teams are too manufactured			1
‘ the difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ and i always use the basic quality of people to achieve what i want to achieve			0
that ’s a different way of thinking			0
i always love that they do things			0
and when it goes wrong , well , try to correct it in one way or another			0
his way is more as a very good organiser			0
’ at times , their personalities seem to infect all football debates , even when @entity1 is no longer a direct participant			1
so when @entity19 ’s @entity18 beat @entity211 5 - 1 at the @entity3 — the then holders with a side full of @entity114 players schooled the @entity155 way — some pronounced it the death of tiki - taka football			1
‘ that sounds absurd , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ first of all , the teams that play that way , like @entity114 or @entity223 now , they are attacking teams			2
the control of the ball is very important			0
you have got a rest and the opponents have to run			0
@entity1 ( left ) and players @entity232 ( centre ) and @entity234 after winning the 1992 @entity106 @entity19 waves on the balcony of the @entity237 after winning the @entity107 title with @entity114 while @entity19 was an average player , @entity1 was considered one of the world 's best of all time ‘ the moment they make a little mistake , you ’re in			1
that ’s a way of playing i think that will never change because a good team with quality players will always do that			2
‘ you see the way @entity164 played in 1974 , so many years ago			0
’ ‘ we did n’t need a type like this , ’ explains @entity1 of his objections			1
‘ we needed other types of people			0
in golf you have one player and a coach for putting , a coach for approaching , a coach for driving			0
‘ in football you have one coach for 20 people			0
it ’s absurd , because they are all individuals in different positions , with all kinds of different qualities , which you have to know			0
‘ you have to control the ball , you have to shoot with your left , with your right , control with the left , you have to run , you have to head , you have to dribble , a lot of things			0
maybe i ’m a very good coach for the offensive part and i ’ll never be a very good coach for the defensive			0
’ @entity280 ( below ) is more autocratic whereas he likes to delegate ? ‘ i always delegate			0
if someone is very good at something , whatever it is , he will be in charge			0
’ @entity1 insists he has no personal issue with @entity19 , though they do not appear to have spoken since that dispute			1
‘ the last few years we did n’t meet because i lived in @entity211 and he was in @entity18			1
it ’s not a question that we do n’t want to see him , because people always create a lot of things that are not there			0
i never have a problem with nobody			0
’ it is the @entity32 way , of course , to have your conflict out in the open			2
there is another protégé of @entity1 ’s currently doing rather better in the @entity302 than @entity19			1
the pair go head - to - head in the 1982 - 83 season , @entity1 for @entity164 ( left ) and @entity19 for @entity306 ( right ) @entity1 ( left ) and @entity307 ( right ) during their respective time as manager of @entity114 @entity311 was at the centre of @entity1 ’s back three when he managed @entity164 and then @entity114			1
@entity311 scored the goal that won the @entity106 in 1992			1
his success at @entity315 does n’t surprise @entity1			1
‘ he was always a key figure			0
at that time everyone was playing two up front and we were playing three at the back			0
it means organisation was required at the the back and that ’s what he did			0
he ’s a strong personality as well			0
he ’s got the vision			0
’ but both being @entity32 and ‘ strong personalities ’ , they would get into discussions over tactics			2
@entity311 the player was seemingly happy to query and question cruyff the manager			1
some might even call it arguing			0
‘ of course , ’ says @entity1 , quite happy at the suggestion			2
‘ @entity338 is part of the game			0
that ’s how you learn			0
‘ it ’s not that i am right or he is			0
it ’s that i see something and i say it but the other one must be capable of doing it			0
they have to solve the problem			0
so maybe when the manager says one thing , you could say : “ but what if this happened ? ”			0
it ’s just a discussion about football , which is beautiful			0
’ or , as we would call it , ‘ a dressing - room bust up ’			2
the @entity32 have always done football differently			2
like our @entity13 facebook page .			2

in an *exclusive* interview , @entity1 said he was n't impressed with @entity4 's work as @entity18 boss at the @entity3
@entity1 criticised @entity19 's direct style and his teams ' lack of passing
he conceded @entity18 making the semi-final in @entity21 was a good result but they were in survival mode : ' i did n’t see the football that i would like . ’
@entity1 's @entity63 style changed the face of football
@entity155 and @entity19 divide the @entity32 footballing *fraternity*
@entity1 was among the world 's greatest ever players and parachuted in to manage @entity114 before winning the @entity106
@entity19 is a grafter - an average player who worked his way from the bottom up as a manager
@entity1 said he sees his influence most in @entity302 managers @entity137 , @entity136 and his protege , @entity315 's @entity311
