@entity1 murder detectives have travelled in secret to a @entity4 island where two @entity6 backpackers were brutally murdered amid concerns two @entity9 bar workers may have been wrongly arrested in connection with their deaths			1
the three investigators from @entity13 arrived into @entity14 by helicopter from @entity16 , avoiding the long ferry voyage from the mainland , and visited @entity19 where @entity20 , 23 , and @entity21 , 24 , were killed last month			1
during their visit , the officers , who were joined by two further @entity24 detectives who arrived on the island earlier in the week , asked questions of a handful of local officials , who had been informed of the top - secret visit			1
police major general @entity43 is the chief investigator in the case , who had been assigned earlier by national police chief @entity48 to take over from regional officers			0
police general @entity40 is a forensic expert who has been involved in the investigation since the bodies of the couple were discovered on the beach on september 15			0
the trip to the beach was kept secret , with no regional police officers being informed , the @entity54 reported today			0
a source reportedly revealed to the newspaper that at least one @entity6 officer is a homicide detective and another is an experienced crime scene expert			0
the reason for the secrecy was not officially explained , but observers in @entity16 said the visit reflected the concerns of @entity6 authorities about the way the murder inquiry had been conducted			2
@entity9 suspects @entity70 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) , both 21 , claim they were made their confession under torture and were forced to perform re-enactment of the murder of the two @entity6 backpackers police said the arrested men ( pictured ) had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves @entity4 police have been criticised for allowing bystanders to trample over the crime scene and to have issued a number of conflicting statements as the investigation continued			1
two @entity9 men have been arrested for the murders but after allegedly confessing to the crimes , they later retracted their statements claiming they had been forced by torture to admit to carrying out the killings			2
during their visit this weekend , the @entity6 team not only stood at the water 's edge on the beach , but also inspected a nearby residence where the two suspects had been staying			0
they also studied an area on the beach where the @entity9 men were said to have been seen playing a guitar in the hours before the @entity6 were murdered			1
as part of their inspection of the area , the @entity6 officers also called at the notorious @entity111 on the waterfront where @entity113 , 23 , from @entity114 , and mr @entity21 , 24 , from @entity115 , had been drinking			0
@entity4 prime minister @entity116 previously said police would not dare arrest the wrong person the bodies of the @entity6 tourists were found on @entity19 in @entity14 ( pictured ) on september 15 a @entity122 image shows @entity6 backpackers @entity21 and @entity20 in @entity4 prior to their deaths the @entity54 said the @entity1 men took pictures of the area before returning to @entity16			1
their visit is seen as a response to widespread concern about the @entity4 police investigation , which prompted @entity133 to ask @entity4 premier @entity135 - o - cha for permission to send @entity1 officers to the island to carry out separate inquiries			2
the agreement was reached , but it is understood the @entity13 team were told they could only observe and advise and not become actively involved in the ongoing investigation			0
the accused men , @entity71 and @entity70 , have been in custody on murder and rape charges since october 2 .			2
