mr @entity0 has ruled that the son of two @entity3 parents should receive a blood transfusion if he needs it for treatment for burns a high court judge has ruled that the son of two devout @entity9 can be given a blood transfusion despite religious objections from his parents			1
mr @entity0 was told by doctors that the ' very young ' boy had suffered severe burns in an accident and might need a blood transfusion			1
but the family division of the @entity19 in @entity20 heard the child 's parents have ' deeply - held views ' which means they object to their son having the transfusion			1
the judge said he had made the ruling in the interest of the boy 's welfare			1
in a written ruling , mr @entity0 said : ' i am extremely grateful to ( the boy 's ) father for so clearly and calmly explaining to me the position held by himself and ( the boy 's ) mother			1
' ] ' i have no doubt at all that they love their son dearly			0
i also have no doubt that they object to the receipt by ( their son ) of a blood transfusion because of their devout beliefs			1
' i hope they will understand why i have reached the decision which i have , governed as it is by ( their son 's ) welfare			1
' @entity54 's witnesses have firm religious beliefs that the new and old testaments command they do not transfer blood , so they do not accept blood transfusions			1
this has led to a number of ' bloodless ' treatments developing			0
the judge said a health trust with responsibility for treating the boy had asked for a ruling			2
he did not name anyone involved and did not give the child 's age			0
the ruling follows similar decisions by two @entity19 judges earlier this year			2
mr @entity72 gave permission for a baby boy to undergo blood transfusions during an operation after being told by a specialist that he had no ' long - term prospect of survival ' if he did not have cardiac surgery			1
mr @entity0 gave the ruling after a hearing at the @entity19 of the @entity19 in @entity20 and said he made the decision in the interests of the boy 's welfare and hoped his devout parents would understand the baby 's parents had agreed to surgery but said they could not consent to their son , who is a few weeks old , receiving blood			1
but mr @entity72 concluded that receiving blood was in the little boy 's best interests , despite his parents ' ' understandable objections '			1
@entity96 had applied for an order that surgery could proceed with blood transfusions			0
@entity9 said their attitude to blood transfusions stems from biblical teachings			2
they claim the @entity104 command them to ' abstain from blood ' and they should not ingest it			0
followers say this is stipulated in passages in @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and acts			0
one example is in @entity116 : ' @entity117 told @entity118 : ' only flesh with its soul - its blood - you must not eat			2
'' the belief has led to the development of a number of ' bloodless medicines ' , with surgeons developing procedures which can be performed without having to do a transfusion			0
however mr justice @entity130 gave doctors permission not to administer blood transfusions to a 63 - year - old woman who was a @entity3			2
the woman had subsequently died			0
doctors working for @entity136 had asked for permission to withhold a blood transfusion			1
they said the woman , who had been a @entity3 since the 1970s at least and had a history of depression and paranoid schizophrenia , was ' gravely ill '			0
mr justice @entity130 said that when doctors made the application the woman had ' clearly lacked ' the mental capacity to make or communicate decisions about treatment			2
but the judge said that after being admitted to hospital the woman had been ' adamant ' that she did not want treatment with any blood products			0
he concluded that the woman had made a decision , when she had the mental capacity , that doctors rightly considered had to be respected			0
the judge said the human right to life was ' fundamental ' but not absolute			0
he said there was no obligation on a patient to accept life - saving treatment and doctors were not entitled or obliged to give treatment .			0

boy suffered severe burns in accident and medics said he may need blood
his parents , @entity9 , objected to son having transfusion
according to their ' strong held ' beliefs *people* should not accept blood
but mr @entity0 ruled he can have a blood transfusion if he needs it
judge told the @entity19 decision was made in interest of his welfare
he said he hoped they would understand why the ruling had been made
