for a manager who is clearly something of an innovator , @entity0 is doing his best to sound old school			1
he is discussing management theory and the different ways in which he attempts to get an alternative view on improving performance at @entity9 , when suddenly he changes tack			1
' sometimes it is what it is , by the way , ' he says			2
' when i came here the team was conceding 2.6 goals a game			2
it was n't rocket science			2
it was n't like i had to find some radical thing of making it work better , other than just shoring up the defence			2
things like that were obvious			2
' @entity0 is football management 's latest miracle man , though he would take umbrage at the characterisation even if it is hard to avoid when he took @entity9 up on a wage bill that was the 15th biggest in the @entity33 and after selling his star striker , @entity34 , to @entity35			1
@entity0 took time out to talk to @entity37 's @entity36 ahead of @entity9 's trip to @entity39 on sunday @entity0 looks up to the skies as he prays for his newly - promoted @entity9 side to turn around their fortunes after a disappointing start to life in the @entity45 clearly there is something about @entity0 , as even he will concede			1
' before christmas last season it was : ' oh , they ca n't do it with just two strikers '			1
then it was : ' oh , they 've been lucky with injuries '			2
no planning , of course			2
' now he has to do it again , only this time against @entity45 clubs with wage bills 10 times his own and with a team who have scored one goal all season and have their two first - choice strikers , @entity68 and @entity69 , injured			1
@entity9 are joint bottom , have not scored in nearly nine hours and could do with a win at @entity39 on sunday			1
again , the problem staring him in the face does not require much analysis			2
' at the minute we have n't scored the goals we wanted			2
are we close ? yes			2
do the stats suggest we 're close ? yes			2
but now it 's about looking at what kind of goals			1
what kind of goals do we want to score ? how can we score those goals ? so there 's a detail within each detail			1
' @entity0 expresses his frustration during @entity9 's home clash with @entity88 last weekend @entity90 's brilliant effort against @entity91 is the only goal @entity9 have to date this season @entity90 expresses his delight after giving the @entity9 a shock lead against @entity96 's side @entity9 players join @entity90 for the celebrations as he points towards the @entity9 faithful after scoring @entity0 embraces with @entity91 boss @entity96 after their meeting at @entity102 in their opening game still , a measure of how far @entity9 have come is that @entity105 are waiting to talk to him			1
@entity0 makes himself at home in the @entity108 bungalow that represents @entity9 's media centre			1
it previously belonged to former @entity9 forward and latterly groundsman , @entity111 , in perpetuity until his death last january			1
now it is the hub of globalised media activity			2
@entity0 , 43 , stands at the centre of it			1
a member of staff tells him the three 0 - 0 draws against @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity88 represents the first time @entity9 have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the top flight since 1968			1
@entity0 loves that ; a positive angle to be gleaned from three games without a goal			1
conversely , he is perplexed by any cynicism			2
he is exasperated as to why some people were annoyed last week when @entity133 's new album automatically downloaded free into @entity134 : ' why would you not want a @entity133 album ? @entity0 is a massive fan of @entity137 rock band @entity133 after revealing how much he rated their new album ' even if you do n't like it , why would you not want it ? maybe my glass is always half full			1
but i ca n't see a negative when someone like @entity133 drop an album in your inbox			2
it 's worth a listen			1
i like dr @entity149 and all that			0
if dr @entity149 wants to drop me a new album , happy days			0
' @entity152 are his ultimate band of choice and he has seen them so many times — ' i am partial to a gig ' — that he launches into an explanation of the best venues at which to see them			0
' when i came out of work at @entity160 , they had a gig at @entity162 , so the band sorted for me and the staff to go			0
oh , it was brilliant			0
' that 's the real deal			1
because i was bit more under the radar then , i could enjoy myself			0
' no more sessions in the mosh pit as a respectable manager ? ' it 's not so easy now			1
' @entity0 brings something different to management			1
people have pointed to the fact that his dad , @entity178 , was a management consultant for @entity179			0
' my dad worked in @entity181 and @entity182 and we had three months in @entity184 when we were kids , ' he says			0
' snakes in the garden , iguanas in the loft and holidays in @entity188 , which my assistant , @entity189 , thought was a mythical place			0
@entity0 applauds the @entity9 fans , whom he holds a close relationship with , after the game against @entity91 ' at the end of @entity200 , @entity198 ' character says : ' i 'm going to a place called @entity202 '			1
@entity203 said : ' i thought you 'd made that up '			0
he did n't believe that we used to go to there when i was seven , jumping off my dad 's shoulders into the water			1
' my dad and i did n't sit there talking about management when i was a kid			0
but there were little key fundamentals			0
in the good old days , everyone would sit round a table and have a meal and converse			0
that 's getting harder to do			1
we do it at home			0
i insist upon it as a family			0
' across that table we 'd be talking about work and , as a kid , you do n't get it at the time			0
and you do n't know what box it lives in , that information			0
but as you get older you reflect on it and think : ' oh , actually , yeah i remember that			0
' you 're subliminally being educated about life			0
' not that he would have you think he has hit on anything special			0
' there 's not a magic switch			1
i have n't found a magic solution to football management , no one has			1
i 'm not looking to reinvent the wheel			0
i 'm just trying to make the best wheel i can			0
the game has been going since the 1800s but the pitch is roughly the same size — the ball is lighter but it 's roughly the same size — there 's still 11 v 11			1
of course there 's technology but the fundamentals have n't changed			1
@entity0 is confident @entity9 will add the missing elements to their game and pick up some much needed wins ' people talk about this tactical 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 or 4 - 3 - 3			1
but i played at @entity260 in 1987			0
the keeper had to play out from the back , that was his instruction and get it out to centre - halves who would split to play and the right - back and left - back would go higher			1
@entity268 on the one wing was coming inside rather than running on , allowing @entity270 to go on the outside			0
' @entity272 was coming short to be the playmaker : now , of course , we call it the quarterback			0
@entity278 was coming in on the front line : now we call it the false no 9			0
and @entity281 was running off the shoulders , to stretch the pitch to allow all these things to happen			0
that sounds pretty modern to me			0
' if i started saying : ' my deep - lying midfield , my screener , my false wingers and the false no 9 … ' i do n't want to be on trend , i want things to work			2
i want a group that is beyond me			0
i do n't wish to pontificate , i do n't wish to brand myself up to the eyeballs			0
i 'm just giving you an honest , authentic opinion			0
' @entity0 is just trying to keep @entity9 up			1
if he manages that though , he will be uber - fashionable .			2

@entity0 *remains* *hugely* *optimistic* about his side @entity9 despite their frustrating start to the season
the @entity9 lie joint - bottom of the @entity45 *alongside* @entity304 , with no win this season and scoring just once in the process
@entity310 - football 's miracle worker - believes the @entity9 will turn the corner sooner rather than later
the newly - promoted side travel to @entity39 on sunday
