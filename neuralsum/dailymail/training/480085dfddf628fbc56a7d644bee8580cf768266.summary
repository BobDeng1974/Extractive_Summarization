by @entity0 published : 11:44 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 05:22 est , 13 march 2013 perhaps it was worried about being turned away , and wanted to be at the front of the queue			0
but sadly for this baby seal , who hauled itself out of the sea and flip - flopped across the road to a nightclub , it was shut when it got there			1
the creature had managed to waddle across a busy road in @entity14 , @entity15 , to arrive at the doorstep of the @entity18 club and amusement arcade at 9am today			1
let me in ! the baby seal seemed eager to go clubbing - but was ushered back to sea by the @entity23 you 're not coming in : the little pup popped up in @entity14 , @entity15 , and managed to waddle across a busy road the seal popped up this morning after making its way 50ft from the sea			1
local @entity30 tweeted a photo of the seal this morning after spotting it outside the club at 9am			2
he wrote : ' saw a seal outside @entity14 arcades			2
how did it end up there ? ' he looked ok and was moving			0
quite a few folk about helping			0
' another local , @entity40 said the seal was helped back into the sea within an hour by @entity23 workers			1
the nightclub in @entity15 clearly interested the curious creature - or perhaps he wanted to try his luck at the bingo next door he said : ' the seal was outside the club for quite a while as nobody seemed quite sure what to do			2
' it 's not every day you see a seal wander across a road and stand about outside a nightclub , which sadly for him was closed at the time ! ' the grey seal and common seal are permanent residents in @entity63 and spend most of their time at sea , only usually coming ashore to breed and moult			1
they sometimes bask peacefully on beaches , sandbanks or rocks			0
but , being curious creatures , they sometimes swim up to boats to investigate what 's going on			0
grey seals have long been a common sight on the shores of @entity78 - but now scientists believe that there could be a breeding ground in the south east , as there have been pups spotted on the south coast , the @entity74 said .			0

the seal waddled across a busy road in @entity14 , @entity15 today
