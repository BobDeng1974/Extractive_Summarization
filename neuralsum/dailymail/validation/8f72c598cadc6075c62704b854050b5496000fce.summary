he admits it is ‘ the biggest gamble of his life ’ and is terrified that his latest television venture will be a flop			1
and it would seem comedian @entity8 , who makes his debut this month as anchor of @entity11 – one of @entity14 ’s top talk shows – may be right to be concerned , according to some members of the test audience at a rehearsal last week			1
@entity8 and his new employers , @entity18 , could be worried that @entity14 audiences wo n’t get his @entity22 brand of humour and they want to ensure he is word perfect for his first live show on march 23 , when @entity27 superstar @entity26 will be a guest			1
response : @entity8 is to make his debut as anchor of @entity11 later this month - but @entity18 bosses could be worried about how he will be received , so a rehearsal was held this week a source on the programme revealed they needed to ‘ iron out the glitches and find out what works ’ , adding : ‘ the @entity14 audience is totally different to anything @entity37 has experienced before			1
it ’s been a real rollercoaster of highs and lows			0
’ the @entity42 gained exclusive access to @entity8 ’s rehearsal last week , and while some of the 200 invited audience – many of them professional actors paid to ‘ fill ’ seats – seemed charmed by his laid - back delivery , most complained that they were ‘ baffled ’ by his sense of humour and found his estuary accent difficult to understand			1
though he told interviewers last week that he intends to ‘ shake up ’ late - night tv in the @entity14 , the new show is surprisingly formulaic			1
@entity8 , 36 , sits behind a desk topped with an old - fashioned rotary phone , while guests sit on a blue sofa in front of a fake backdrop of @entity62			1
there is a small bar set up in the corner of the studio , staffed by barman @entity67 , and a house band led by wild - haired musician @entity69			2
the comic opened the ‘ show ’ with a monologue of jokes , including one about last week ’s scandal over @entity75 members who crashed into a @entity77 barrier after a drunken party			2
‘ they ’ve got a new motto – to protect and serve me another , ’ he told his audience			2
guest @entity86 , from @entity87 , @entity88 , who attended thursday ’s rehearsal said : ‘ i ’d never heard of @entity8 until today			1
' he seems to be a very friendly , nice guy but i did n’t get some of his jokes and i found him a bit hard to understand at times			2
he speaks quite quickly and used @entity22 words like mate			2
‘ i enjoyed some of the humour but i ’m not sure how well he will go down in @entity14			0
’ revolutionary : despite @entity8 - seen here interviewing @entity98 , of sitcom 2 @entity100 , and @entity101 , from crime show ncis : @entity62 - promising the shake up the tried - and - tested format , some audience members complained there was little to differentiate it from other talk shows another woman , @entity109 , who revealed she was being paid as a ‘ seat filler ’ said : ‘ i do n’t think enough people know who he is			1
i did n’t enjoy the show much			2
’ the dress rehearsal came amid increasing concerns that @entity8 , who has lost 6st in the run - up to the show ’s launch , has been under tremendous stress , doubtless mindful that many other @entity22 , such as @entity122 , and @entity123 , tried and failed to crack the @entity14 audience			1
while friends and family insist his new , slimline image is the result of a conscious effort to look svelte for his big launch , others close to the show say his fear of failure is the real reason that he has lost so much weight			2
risk : @entity8 has moved his family - wife @entity138 , son @entity139 , three , and four - month - old daughter @entity138 - to @entity62 , but admits taking the role is the biggest gamble of his life so far in recent weeks he has displayed obvious signs of anxiety			1
‘ there have been a few heated moments , ’ the source said			0
‘ there have been a few raised voices			0
but that can be normal for any new show			2
‘ you ca n’t blame him for being stressed and nervous			0
his entire professional future is on the line			0
’ @entity8 , who relocated to @entity62 at @entity157 with wife @entity138 and their children @entity139 , three , and 14 - week - old @entity160 , is on a reported £ 1.5 million - a - year deal			1
he admits @entity18 has taken ‘ a huge gamble ’ bringing him to the @entity14 , saying : ‘ i do n’t know if i ’m making a huge mistake			1
but i ’d rather regret doing something than not doing something			0
‘ it ’s madness really			0
when i got the job i ’d never even been on an @entity14 talk show			2
’ before thursday night ’s rehearsal began @entity8 , clearly on edge , spoke to the audience			1
he told them : ‘ this is a dream come true for me			0
if you ’d told the 12 - year - old me that i would be doing this i would never have believed it			1
’ he also spoke about his children , saying : ‘ when you have one kid it ’s like having a pet			0
when you have two it ’s like getting the whole zoo			0
’ but he appeared distracted at times , with one onlooker commenting : ‘ he seemed like he had a lot on his mind			0
there were times during the moments by himself when he looked stressed and worried			0
’ he interviewed comedian @entity98 , of sitcom 2 @entity100 , and actor @entity101 , from crime show ncis : @entity62			1
when @entity98 joked about @entity22 being ‘ a nation of alcoholics ’ @entity8 replied : ‘ i would refute that although i am aware that i ’m the only late - night host with a bar in his studio			1
’ family man : @entity8 told the audience about his newly expanded brood , saying : ‘ when you have one kid it ’s like having a pet			1
when you have two it ’s like getting the whole zoo			0
’ unknown ? : some said they thought @entity8 was not well - known enough to do well as a talk show host in the @entity217 - but @entity18 have been doing a lot of promotion to spread his name around , like this billboard stunt afterwards one @entity22 audience member said : ‘ the show was pretty predictable			1
the main difference between this one and the other @entity14 late - night shows is that the guests walked out and sat on the sofa together			2
it ’s more like @entity231 ’s show in format			2
‘ there were skits and jokes and a house band			0
he made the effort to engage the audience and invited everyone up on to the stage at the end to dance			0
' but there ’s nothing revolutionary about it			0
he ’s likeable but wo n’t win any originality awards			0
he was trying very hard , though			0
the tone of the show is sweet			0
’ @entity247 , who also watched the show , added : ‘ @entity8 worked really hard and is a likeable man			1
but i ’m not sure he ’s got what it takes to be a huge success here			0
the show is too similar to everything else out there			0
' i wish him well but i wo n’t be tuning in			0
’ @entity257 , @entity18 vice president , @entity259 , @entity260 said : ' the studio audience reception to the practice shows has been terrific			1
80 % of the audience has re-booked for a future taping			0
a late night host with an accent is hardly a foreign concept to @entity18			1
we find @entity37 @entity22 accent quite charming			1

@entity8 *due* to make his debut as anchor of @entity11 this month
but dress rehearsal to gauge reception has revealed problems
audience members complain @entity22 actor *'s* accent is hard to understand
others said it was ' boring ' , with nothing to make it stand out from the rest
@entity8 and his young family relocated to @entity62 so he can host the @entity18 show
but 36 - year - old has admitted the job is ' the biggest gamble of his life '
