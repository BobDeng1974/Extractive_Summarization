@entity1 soldier @entity0 jumped into @entity2 on @entity3 with the @entity4 his daughter , @entity5 , said her father would ' relive ' his battle days each night at the dinner table but she did not pay attention @entity0 died in 1993 @entity5 recently digitized as a swathe of wartime interviews her father conducted she said that listening to them was like hearing the stories for the first time this year marks the 70th anniversary of d - day , which remains one of the world 's most gut - wrenching and consequential battles by @entity21 every night at dinner when i was young , my dad fought @entity1 all over again			1
he 'd parachuted into @entity2 with the @entity4 on d - day , went on to fight in @entity26 and @entity27 , and he loved to tell war stories			1
but as a kid , i did n't care			2
i grew up in the 1960s and ' 70s , when anti-war sentiment about @entity32 was strong			2
it was n't cool having a dad whose biggest accomplishment was being a soldier			1
it was only as an adult that i wished i 'd paid more attention to those dinnertime tales			1
fortunately , i have some extraordinary mementoes			2
memories : @entity5 - shown as a child after her graduation from elementary school in @entity46 with her father , @entity0 - has released old interviews her dad did about @entity1 and his experience of d - day , 70 years after the @entity3 @entity0 , pictured while serving with the @entity4 in @entity53 , parachuted into @entity2 on @entity3 , june 6 , 1944 , and later fought in @entity26 and @entity27 @entity56 troops of the 4th @entity57 ( ' @entity58 ' ) land on @entity59 on june 6 , 1944 , as @entity61 forces storm the @entity2 beaches			1
@entity3 is still one of the world 's most gut - wrenching and consequential battles , as the @entity61 landing in @entity2 led to the liberation of @entity69 and marked the turning point in the @entity72 theater of @entity1 @entity73 , who died in 1993 , was interviewed on radio shows in 1944 , shortly after d - day , then in 1945 at a military hospital , and finally on local tv for the 40th anniversary of @entity3			1
this year i digitized the old - media recordings — 78 rpm records and a 1984 videotape			1
when i played them for the first time in years , i heard what i had n't heard as a kid : how tough he was , how hard it was , how brave these soldiers were			1
here , in his words , is what it was like to jump out of a plane shortly after midnight on june 6 , 1944 , land behind enemy lines and help launch the offensive that ultimately defeated @entity96			2
' we hit @entity69 soil just a little over six hours before the first ship hit the beach , ' cpl. @entity0 said on a show called @entity102 in @entity103 , taped by the @entity104 on aug. 26 , 1944			1
' i was in plane no. 5 that went over to knock out coastal batteries that were trained onto the beach			0
our plane was hit by some of that @entity111 20 millimeter flak			0
' we had to bail out as soon as we got into @entity69 territory			0
' once on the ground , he said , ' a group of us got together , nine to be exact '			0
as they headed toward their target , ' we were hampered , i 'll say , by some @entity111 machine - gun nests '			1
this 1940s era photo provided by @entity5 shows her father @entity0 , in @entity122 uniform , posing with his parents , @entity124 and @entity125 , in @entity46			1
@entity0 parachuted into @entity2 with the @entity4 on d - day monumental : on d - day , june 6 , 1944 , a landing craft just vacated by invasion troops points towards a fortified beach on the @entity130			1
@entity56 soldiers wade to shore fighting heavy machine gun fire from the @entity111 with four men on one side of him and four on the other , ' i told them to crawl up as close as we could '			0
' and when i whistled , everybody was to throw a grenade , ' he recalled in 1984 on @entity142			0
' when we got there , all we saw was a lot of wrecks and dead @entity111			0
' he won a @entity148 for leading the charge that silenced the nest , without regard to his personal safety			0
but his account 40 years later hinted at the fear and regret			0
' you did n't know what was around you , ' he said			0
' you did n't know where you were			0
you did n't know if the fellow next to you was friend or enemy , all in blackface			0
' he got back to his command post four days later , but not everyone made it			1
' a mortar shell landed amongst four of the fellows including our top sergeant and killed them all , ' he said			0
' as you go along , you pass bodies , and you just have to keep going			0
' @entity73 fought with the 101st for 37 straight days in @entity69			2
in september 1944 , he went to @entity26 , to @entity172 , a battle depicted in the movie ' @entity174 '			2
in december , they dug in for the siege of @entity177 , @entity27 , part of the @entity179			0
he earned a second @entity148 , two presidential citations and a @entity181			0
though he died in 1993 , wartime radio interviews and a tv interview conducted by @entity0 on @entity3 preserved his stories his 1945 interview with @entity186 was done at @entity187 , an @entity122 hospital on @entity189 , @entity46 , as he recuperated from a bullet wound that crippled his right arm			1
looking back , he seems to me like a character straight out of a black - and - white @entity1 movie			1
he smoked like a chimney , drank like a fish and lived every day like it was his last — which is one way to prepare yourself to jump from a plane into a war zone			2
for the rest of his life , his war buddies were his best friends ; nobody else could understand what they 'd been through			0
and he loved @entity207 , the @entity69 apple brandy he first tasted in @entity2			1
listening to the recordings now , i 'm struck by his nonchalance			2
as he described encountering machine - gun fire , he said , ' that held us up for a while '			2
commando troops coming ashore from landing craft during the @entity3 in @entity69 in june 1944 when the interviewer asked , ' one vital question : did you get them ? ' he answered simply , ' yes , sir '			1
and there was this memorable aside : ' i love hand grenades			0
' i have a 16 - year - old son now , about the age i was when i did n't want to hear my father 's stories			1
my dad died before this boy was born , and as we listened together to his grandpa 's voice , i could see the look of amazement on his face			1
' your dad was cool , ' he finally said			0
yeah , he was .			0
