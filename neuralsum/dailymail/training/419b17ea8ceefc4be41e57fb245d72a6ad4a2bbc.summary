by @entity0 @entity1 has unveiled its most radical vehicle yet - a one - of - a - kind pickup truck designed to tackle tough terrain			1
the @entity5 is a four - wheel drive mini concept which has had its rear seats replaced with a cargo area			2

the @entity5 is a four - wheel drive mini concept which has had its rear seats replaced with a cargo area			2
it has been designed for transporting goods across gravel roads , through muddy tracks and on desert trails the engineers behind the creation also fitted the @entity5 with a snorkel - style air filter that allows the pickup truck to drive through rivers and streams			1
the pickup has a modified chassis with extended ground clearance and much higher front and rear clearance ramps			0
it has additional lights mounted on the front cross member of the roof rack , to boost visibility at night , while special off - road tyres with wide and deep treads are designed to improve traction			2
the @entity5 was designed by @entity1 design apprentices in @entity39 and unveiled by the firm this week			0
it is not the first @entity1 pickup - the iconic car was similarly converted into a commercial vehicle between 1961 and 1982			1
however , the @entity5 dwarves its inspiration in size and performance			0
engineers have fitted the @entity5 , pictured , with a snorkel - style air filter which allows the pickup truck to drive through rivers and streams			1
it is a departure from the norm for @entity1 , who are more commonly associated with small city - based cars the pickup , pictured , has a modified chassis with extended ground clearance and much higher front and rear clearance ramps			0
it has additional lights mounted on the front cross member of the roof rack to boost visibility at night , while special off - road tyres with wide and deep treads are designed to improve traction the @entity68 was used as the base model for the pickup , with students , pictured , transforming the car into a two - seater with a pickup - style cargo area the original @entity1 pickup had a tiny 850cc engine which developed just 37 brake horse power ( bhp )			1
it took almost 34 seconds to reach 60 miles ( 95km ) per hour and was capable of just 69 miles ( 111 km ) per hour			0
the @entity5 , by comparison , has a 1.6 - litre turbocharged engine developing 184bhp			0
this gives the concept car a 0 to 62 miles ( 100km ) per hour time of less than 8 seconds and a top speed in excess of 130 miles ( 210km ) per hour			0
@entity1 originally built more than 50,000 pickups , but the @entity87 - owned company said there were no current plans for the @entity5 to see full - scale production			2
the @entity5 is not the first @entity1 pickup to be made - back in 1961 the iconic @entity1 was converted into a commercial pickup vehicle until it was discontinued in 1982 unfortunately there are no plans for a production version of the vehicle just yet , so fans will need to make do with seeing it in action in these images			1

@entity103 students at @entity1 have revealed their unique off - road vehicle
they converted a @entity68 into a pickup truck
the car has a cargo area in place of back seats and *spotlights* on top
thanks to smart engineering it can also drive through rivers and streams
@entity1 had a pickup car until 1982 but has no plans to return it to production
