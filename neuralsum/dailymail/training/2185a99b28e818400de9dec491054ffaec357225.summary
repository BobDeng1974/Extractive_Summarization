report : @entity1 was in control of the strategic health authority responsible for supervising @entity4 between 2005 and 2006 as a young @entity6 trainee at the height of the @entity8 , @entity1 idolised @entity10 leader @entity9			1
at the same time as starting work in a mental health unit he joined the @entity14 in 1977			2
he was no ordinary revolutionary			2
he was on the hardline , so - called ‘ @entity22 ’ wing of the party which backed the @entity19 using military action to crush dissident uprisings			2
today , @entity1 is the £ 270,000 - a year chief executive of the @entity6			1
the one - time radical who used to regard political honours as elitist symbols of bourgeoisie government was happy to be knighted in 2010			2
nicknamed the ‘ @entity32 ’ of the @entity6 because of his abrasive management style , his rise up the management ladder saw him take control of the strategic health authority responsible for supervising @entity4 between 2005 and 2006			1
it was during this period that patients needlessly died because of appalling standards of care			2
today ’s damning report into the scandal could yet bring an end to his career – during which he forced through the last @entity46 government ’s controversial ‘ target culture ’ that fatally undermined the ethos of care that has traditionally been a hallmark of @entity6 hospitals			1
it has been a remarkable journey for a man who was a communist for six years until his membership lapsed in 1983			2
critics say that the ‘ uncaring culture ’ that has developed in some aspects of healthcare can be likened to the one that prevailed during the godless @entity10 regimes			1
but @entity1 , 57 , wo n’t discuss his communist past			1
the @entity6 chief was brought up in @entity63 – his father was crippled with emphysema and confined to a wheelchair			2
this tragic experience inculcated in his son the importance of the principle of an @entity6 free at the point of delivery			2
it ’s not clear if he abandoned @entity75 to further his career , or because his views mellowed			2
but one thing is certain : @entity1 has always done his political masters ’ bidding			1
as chief executive of @entity81 in the 1990s , when the @entity83 government was in power , he was part of one of the first health trusts to break away from the control of @entity89 , amid fierce opposition from @entity46 and the unions			0
beliefs : it is unclear whether @entity1 abandoned @entity75 because his views mellowed , or to further his career damning : the report into @entity95 could bring an end to @entity1 's career after a series of senior regional posts , in 2006 he became @entity6 chief executive under prime minister @entity101			1
@entity1 was expected to quit when the @entity103 - led @entity102 came to power in 2010 , but he was given additional responsibilities			1
however , his stewardship of the @entity6 since the election has been mired in controversy			0
he refused to cancel a major @entity6 it project which became a monument to @entity89 folly when it was clear that costs were out of control			0
eventually it was cancelled at a loss to the taxpayer of £ 12.7billion			0
@entity1 was appointed as @entity6 chief executive under @entity101 , and @entity118 is the third prime minister he has served despite such a scandalous waste of money , @entity1 escaped blame and still enjoys the confidence of @entity118 ( the third pm he ’s served )			1
not all @entity123 , though , are so impressed			0
mp @entity124 , a member of the @entity125 , says : ‘ we had a major @entity6 it programme that went spectacularly wrong			0
@entity1 was the accounting officer			1
what scale of blunder do you have to make before you are held accountable for failure ? ’ similar questions have been asked of his role in the @entity102 ’s botched @entity134			0
there were a series of anonymous and particularly poisonous briefings from within the @entity138 about the then health secretary @entity140 ’s handling of the legislation			0
in due course , the draft bill was postponed after it was deemed to be confused and overly complex			0
@entity1 remained in post while @entity140 was replaced as health secretary			1
within weeks , @entity1 was warning that ‘ high - profile , politically - driven changes almost always end in misery and disaster ’			1
these comments broke the @entity89 convention that civil servants criticise policy only in private , not in public			0
but @entity1 is a law unto himself			1
‘ no one crosses him			0
he ’s like a ruthless omnipotent medieval @entity157 , ’ said one senior official			0
incidentally , relations between @entity1 and @entity140 had never recovered after the minister spotted the civil service chief travelling first class by train to a conference when @entity140 himself was going to the same meeting , but in second class			1
but then @entity1 loves travelling first class			1
on saturday , the @entity167 disclosed that he racked up nearly £ 6,000 in 41 first - class train tickets in a year to @entity169			0
each time he claimed to have been ‘ attending official meetings ’ but , in fact , they were held via video - conferencing , meaning he could have taken part from anywhere in the country			0
@entity178 have indicated that they will ask @entity1 to justify the expenditure			1
wife : @entity1 got engaged in 2009 to @entity181 , the chief executive of @entity182 many of the trips spanned ‘ long weekends ’ , prompting speculation he was going to his see his new young wife at their home in @entity169			1
divorced with two grown - up sons , @entity1 had earlier got engaged in 2009 to @entity181 , the chief executive of @entity182			1
it was not just the 22 - year age gap which caused consternation			0
it was also the fact @entity1 met her while she was seconded to his office as a junior			1
@entity1 has told @entity6 trusts to deliver between £ 15billion and £ 20billion in efficiency savings before 2014 @entity1 , then director of @entity200 for the @entity201 and @entity202 , took a shine to the attractive graduate trainee , acting as her mentor			1
he also gave her two job references – the second leading to her appointment as chief operating officer at @entity182			0
she was in the job when the @entity211 delivered a devastating report over a catalogue of patient failures at the hospital			2
two years later , despite the criticism , she became chief executive on a £ 155,000 salary , at the relatively youthful age of 32			0
by this time she was engaged to @entity1 – the all - powerful head of the @entity6			1
for his part , @entity1 has told @entity6 trusts to deliver between £ 15billion and £ 20billion in efficiency savings before 2014 ( the equivalent of to up to 6 per cent of the current @entity6 budget )			2
meanwhile , his own personal spending included £ 155,000 worth of expenses in four years			0
his annual expenses for his plush @entity229 flat was triple the @entity178 ’ second homes allowance			0
he gave up the property on condition that taxpayers covered any hotel bills incurred and despite the fact he chose to live in @entity169			0
he also has a chauffeur - driven car			0
how ironic if this former @entity14 member ’s downfall was triggered not by the tragic effects of the ‘ target culture ’ he ruthlessly enforced which contributed to the fiasco at @entity243 , but if he was censured by a committee of mps for using taxpayers ’ money on his lavish expenses .			0
