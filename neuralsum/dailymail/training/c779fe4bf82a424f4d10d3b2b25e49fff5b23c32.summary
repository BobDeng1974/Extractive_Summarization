the ‘ @entity4 ’ drug mules are facing a fresh setback to their hopes of a transfer back to the @entity9 after being unexpectedly moved to a remote prison hours outside of @entity1 in the middle of the desert			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , who are serving a seven - year jail term after being caught smuggling £ 1.5 million worth of cocaine , have been clinging to hopes that they might be sent home to serve the remainder of their sentences			1
but the pair , who until now have been housed in @entity1 ’s all - female @entity22 prison , were bussed out to @entity23 , where prostitution and drug - taking is rife , on thursday			1
@entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) , who are serving a seven - year jail term in @entity27 after being caught smuggling £ 1.5m worth of cocaine , have been unexpectedly transferred to a prison in the middle of the desert the pair , who until now have been housed in @entity1 's all - female @entity22 prison , were bussed out to @entity23 , where prostitution and drug - taking is rife , on thursday in another blow , the women also face the prospect of being separated for the first time since their arrest and kept in different cells			1
the move will dampen hopes that the drug mules , both 20 , will be transferred back to the @entity9 anytime in the near future , with authorities making no official comment on the ongoing negotiations			1
last night @entity10 ’s father , @entity49 , 54 , told @entity50 : ‘ this has come as a real shock			1
it ’s a really worrying time for the family , we ’re still waiting to hear something from @entity10			1
‘ even if you were moved , you ’d still think you ’d be allowed a phone call back home to your family to tell them you ’re ok			0
we have n’t heard anything since wednesday			0
‘ i got the feeling that the girls had integrated quite well at @entity22 but the situation they ’re in now they ’ll have to do that all again			2
until we hear from them it ’s difficult now how they ’re doing			0
i just hope they ’re ok			0
’ the @entity65 confirmed last month that they have received ‘ a repatriation application ’ from @entity27 for @entity10 and it is understood @entity67 - born @entity11 has made a similar application			1
but @entity10 ’s family , from @entity71 , near @entity72 , have yet to receive any update on the application and are now coming to terms with the fact that it may be a lengthy wait			2
the move will dampen hopes that the drug mules , both 20 , will be transferred back to the @entity9 anytime in the near future , with authorities making no official comment on the ongoing negotiations ‘ we were a bit swept up in a wave of emotion thinking the transfer might happen fairly quickly but i think i ’m back to reality in realising that it wo n’t happen as soon as we hoped			1
it ’s like a rollercoaster at the moment – really up and down , ’ mr @entity83 said			0
@entity23 is a mixed prison complex housing almost 3,000 inmates , of which around 325 are foreign , more than 100 of them women and most of whom are there on drug charges			1
it can take almost three hours from the capital to reach its remote location north of @entity1			2
@entity105 , a @entity9 woman who visited her partner in @entity107 last year , gave a first - hand insight into the harsh conditions at the prison in the @entity112 newsletter			1
she wrote : ‘ there is a tension within the walls , almost a vacuum , and a timeless void			0
the nature of the design is to segregate and wear down the spirit			0
‘ every surface inside is a seamless shade of grey , even the food served to them is a cold grey mush			0
' it feels like the monotony and boredom sucks the life out of the men			0
you can feel their shame as they hang their heads and shuffle by chain by their hands and feet			0
’ @entity139 , a @entity140 academic specialising in female prisons in @entity27 who has interviewed more than 100 inmates , told @entity50 : ‘ it ’s a modern purpose - built prison in the middle of the desert and they seem to be shipping all the foreign prisoners out there			1
‘ there are no trees or grass			0
the biggest problem is that it ’s in the middle of the desert , so the water sometimes does n’t work and phone lines cut out			0
last time i visited there , the women were complaining that there were insects in the food - it ’s not very nice			2
’ the women were each jailed for six years and eight months in december after trying to smuggle £ 1.5million worth of cocaine out of @entity27 in their suitcases at @entity167 last august			2
this month @entity50 revealed how @entity169 ’s tour manager paid the drug mules a surprise visit , bringing them @entity172 and chocolate easter eggs .			2
