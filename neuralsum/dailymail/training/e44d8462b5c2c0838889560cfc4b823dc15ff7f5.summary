by @entity0 and @entity1 working class : @entity3 would front the campaign an attempt to play down the @entity7 ’s ‘ posh ’ image backfired when a campaign to promote working - class @entity10 mps found only 14 with sufficiently humble roots			1
panicking party chiefs have now launched a desperate search for more conservative mps who were not ‘ born with silver spoons in their mouths ’ – begging them to step forward to rescue the initiative			1
@entity18 had hoped to launch the campaign , which features former prime minister @entity3 , the son of a circus performer , at the party conference in september			1
but he has been forced to go back to the drawing board because the 14 ‘ working - class @entity10 ’ featured in the new ‘ @entity27 ’ campaign represent fewer than one in 20 of its 305 mps			1
to add to the problems , other mps have said that some of the ‘ i ’m a working - class @entity10 ’ claims are ‘ laughable ’			1
and the organiser , @entity33 , has faced a revolt by fellow mps who have said that despite their genuinely modest backgrounds , they had been given no opportunity to take part			1
in an email marked ‘ strictly private and confidential ’ he told them : ‘ a number of colleagues have complained that they are working class and want to know why they were not included			1
i did my best to identify working - class @entity10 and i am sorry if you were left out			1
as a result we are producing a further edition			0
if you have working - class credentials and want to contribute , let me know			2
’ mr @entity33 ’s account of his own working - class roots states : ‘ i was born in the @entity59 of @entity60			2
we had no bathroom , a tin bath used to hang on the wall outside , an outside toilet , and a scrubbing board , not a washing machine			0
we did n’t have a telephone , we just threw the window open and shouted loudly			0
so when i became @entity52 mp i was completely at home with lots of @entity55			0
’ @entity69 mp @entity68 wrote : ‘ my grandfather was a chef who once made a cake for [ @entity74 @entity73 leader ] @entity72			0
’ armed forces minister and @entity77 mp @entity76 said : ‘ defence brought me into politics			0
i was fascinated by the @entity80 and my bedroom was full of @entity83 models and plastic soldiers			0
‘ i ’ve always had contempt for champagne socialists racked by middle - class guilt who profess their love for working - class people but would scarcely dream of inviting them to dinner			2
’ rethink : @entity18 will have to reconsider after an e-mail by @entity33 ( right ) who organised the campaign @entity97 @entity10 mp @entity96 wrote : ‘ seeing people i went to school with who never bothered doing homework or paying any attention fail their exams and spend years living off the @entity104 shaped me			1
‘ i used to be up at 5am to do the papers in @entity106 before college , and got up at 4am to sweep a factory floor while doing my degree			0
’ former miner , transport minister @entity111 , and @entity113 secretary @entity112 , whose father came to @entity115 from @entity116 with £ 1 in his pocket , also feature in the campaign			2
one conservative mp told @entity120 : ‘ we are right to be proud of real working - class @entity10 heroes like @entity3 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
‘ but this campaign has been badly handled			2
with only 14 mps , it has played into our opponents ’ hands			0
‘ one or two of the stories sound like the @entity130 sketch where one @entity97 boasts about living in a shoe box in the middle of a road and another says he lived in a paper bag in a septic tank			0

@entity138 hoped to launch campaign with @entity3 at september conference
but party of opportunity plug featured just one in 20 of the party *'s* mps
several other working class @entity10 claimed they were left out of the list
