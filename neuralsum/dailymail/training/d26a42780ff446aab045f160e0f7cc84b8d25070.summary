@entity0 will be unveiled as a @entity2 player on thursday , and the man tipped to become ‘ the greatest rugby star on the planet ’ will speak about his decision to switch codes in a bid for @entity8 glory			1
the 25 - year - old will hold a press conference at the @entity13 less than a month after guiding the @entity14 to a historic @entity16 victory , which saw him shatter his eye socket in the first minute but go on to earn the man - of - the - match award and , with it , a place in league folklore			1
the man they call ‘ @entity24 ’ needed five metal plates inserted to reconstruct his face following the dramatic triumph over @entity28			0
the former @entity44 was lured to @entity2 by a big - money offer and the prospect of following in the footsteps of @entity49 — the only @entity43 to switch codes and win the union @entity8			1
with less than a year to prove himself ahead of next september ’s global tournament many doubt the 18 - stone former loose forward — being lined up to play inside centre — can make the transition in time			1
his tackling technique , in particular , is likely to be heavily scrutinized			0
@entity49 is not among the doubters			0
‘ it took me three months after my switch to play for @entity63 and get on a @entity65 tour and i ’ve no doubt @entity24 can do the same , ’ said the 2003 @entity8 winner and former @entity60 great			1
‘ he ’s already got the title as the best player in rugby league and has all the ingredients to do the same in rugby union			1
i think @entity24 will play in the @entity8			0
i certainly think he can be the best - ever cross-code player			1
’ the two brothers embraced before @entity0 jetted off on a flight to the @entity76 to join his new club @entity2 @entity0 holds hands with his girlfriend , and the pair will be reunited in a couple of weeks @entity0 @ @entity82 ‘ well , i ’ve arrived in bath and been for a look around			1
quite jet lagged now but powering on			0
what @entity88 tonight ? ?			0
’ @entity0 was happy in his new surroundings on wednesday after flying in from @entity39 the @entity91 insist they played no part in @entity0 ’s switch but @entity94 — a huge admirer of league — is clearly excited by the prospect of working with such a talent			1
@entity63 ’s midfield is still not settled , with injury and lack of form hampering @entity104 ’s attempts to forge a tried and trusted partnership			1
@entity0 could yet be the answer to his prayers			1
‘ having spoken to him , his mind - set obviously is to make the @entity8 squad , ’ @entity94 said			2
‘ we have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn quickly , but he ’s mentally strong			0
if he can learn the game he ’ll bring an invaluable amount to the group			0
he is a very , very good player and an impressive person			0
‘ what stands out for me is his mental toughness and strength , the desire to dominate his opposite number			0
it will be fascinating to see how he goes			0
’ those who have worked with @entity0 speak of an intensely competitive individual , even by the standards of professional rugby , with an almost superhuman capacity to absorb pain and a relentless work ethic which drives others around him			1
@entity135 - born actor and @entity14 owner @entity134 — who signed him from @entity137 in 2010 — described @entity0 as his ‘ sparkly - eyed man ’			1
without doubt , @entity0 is a leader of men			2
burgess in action during the 2013 @entity8 semi-final match between @entity63 and @entity135 @entity31 will fly to @entity2 in two weeks time to join boyfriend @entity0 as he begins his rugby union career @entity0 said his loved ones are excited for him joining @entity146 side @entity2 the death of his father , former professional league player @entity148 , at the age of 44 is said to have had a profound effect on @entity24 , along with his three younger brothers , who he has left behind at the @entity14 to forge a new career in union			1
‘ @entity24 has made himself a legend in rugby league , ’ said @entity2 owner @entity154 , a key player in the deal to bring @entity0 to the @entity156 ‘ it was absolutely extraordinary that he was able to play 79 minutes with a broken cheek bone and be man - of - the - match as well			1
he is a warrior who is going to create huge interest in the @entity43 game			0
it can only be good for rugby			0
’ his arrival is set to attract unprecedented attention on @entity2 — an upwardly mobile club with a great history and an increasingly rosy future			1
on tuesday , @entity173 scrum - half @entity171 indicated his interest in joining @entity0 at @entity2			1
‘ obviously the chance to possibly play with someone as special a player like that is definitely appealing , ’ @entity175 said			0
@entity0 ( far left ) with mother @entity180 and brothers @entity30 , @entity182 and @entity183 after the 2014 @entity16 the @entity2 star celebrates with @entity134 after the @entity14 won the @entity16 match in @entity32 ‘ you saw the type of character he was in that @entity16 grand final			1
you always want to play with guys who are inspirational and make such an impact			0
’ but what do those already at the @entity156 think of his pending arrival ? ‘ when ( @entity2 coach ) @entity196 spoke to me about signing him the first thing he mentioned was his character , ’ said @entity2 captain @entity195			2
‘ he felt he would fit into our @entity2 system			2
i ’m excited about welcoming him and helping him learn our sport and ultimately become a very successful rugby union player			2
i do n’t think there ’s a danger of his arrival disrupting us			0
we ’ve got numerous people who could be involved with @entity63 through to the @entity8			2
‘ if everything goes to plan and @entity63 win they will all be superstars			1
we ’re aware of this			0
you have to deal with it			0
it ’s part and parcel of wanting to become a great club			0
’ of course , a pocket of union diehards will dismiss @entity0 ’s chances out of hand			2
time is against him and history suggests more converts fail than succeed			0
but such was his league stature , and such is @entity63 ’s desire for him to make the grade , it would be folly to write off his chances of making the @entity8 ; despite the inconvenience of a depressed fracture of his cheek delaying his start until the turn of the year			1
@entity31 admitted that ' there were a few sponge baths ' as @entity24 recovered from his on - pitch clash @entity0 poses after being awarded rugby league 's @entity236 last week his brutish carrying , sublime off - loading and incredible work - rate has drawn comparisons with @entity240 , who switched codes at short notice and became an @entity244 winner in 2011			1
it is not beyond the realms of possibility that @entity0 leapfrogs @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 to claim the @entity252 jersey			2
‘ he wo n’t take much bedding in because his size and the threat he poses in league make him a completely different kettle of fish , ’ said another successful cross-coder , @entity254 and @entity63 winger @entity255			1
‘ @entity24 ’s an exception			0
if you watch him play league , he ’s the best player on the pitch every single time			2
there are n’t many players like that — he ’s up there with @entity240			0
but whatever @entity0 achieves in union , and however long he sticks around , the mark he has left in @entity39 , where league is king , is indelible			1
‘ people talk about @entity24 becoming the greatest @entity43 forward to ever come to @entity39 , ’ said @entity276 chief executive @entity275			2
‘ the reality is he could be one of the greatest forwards to have ever played the game			0
’ @entity0 has a new game to play now			2
it ’s going to be some ride .			0

@entity0 left @entity39 to fly to the @entity76 to join new club @entity2
the former rugby league player quit @entity14 to sign for @entity289 outfit @entity2
@entity0 's girlfriend @entity31 will join him in @entity2 in two weeks
the 25 - year - old fractured his *cheekbone* and eye socket during @entity32 's @entity16 grand final win earlier this month
@entity2 lost 21 - 19 at home to @entity298 on *saturday*
@entity63 will be hoping he is the final piece of *jigsaw*
