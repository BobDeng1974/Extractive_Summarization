conservationists have managed to boost the numbers of the protected species at the zoo by giving courting seahorses a bit of privacy - separating them from the rest of the group when they look like they are about to mate			1
the zoo 's work in boosting the numbers of native short and long - snouted varieties has for the last 17 years been taking place in a warehouse behind the public aquarium			2
but a special exhibition which opened yesterday has now made it available for all to see			1
@entity32 , curator of the aquariam at @entity3 , said : ' we noticed when we kept the seahorses in bigger groups , a pair would start a courtship dance , and another male - or sometimes a female - would try to muscle in and disrupt their ability to complete a courtship			2
' now we put a mixture of males and females in a larger courtship tank , then , when we observe a couple pairing off , we give them their own individual tanks			0
it 's their honeymoon suite			1
' the work is being carried out as part of @entity54 , a worldwide breeding and conservation programme which aims to address what conservations believe to be the rapidly dwindling population of the fish			1
seahorses , who mate for life , perform an elaborate flirtation dance when they choose a partner , giving very clear indications before they mate			0
it is when staff at the zoo see the fish carrying out such behaviour , which includes them entwining their tails , they remove them to a private breeding tank			2
@entity3 also uses spherical tanks with a current running through in a bid to keep more of the offspring alive			0
the tanks look to replicate ocean life for the young fry			0
when they are born they are removed straight away to allow their mother and father to start mating again			0
when they are a little older , the young fish themselves are moved into tanks where they can select mates			0
