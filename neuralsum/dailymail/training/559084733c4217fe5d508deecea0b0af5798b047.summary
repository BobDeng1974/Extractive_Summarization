the analysis of @entity2 's erratic final movements paints a terrifying picture of the doomed flight 's last moments , with an expert saying they fit the pattern of a pilot on a suicide mission who wanted to crash the plane in one of the world 's most inaccessible areas			1
the remote crash site , now tracked to 2,500kms off @entity18 's west coast , means salvage teams might never recover the plane 's black box , which would leave the flight 's fate forever shrouded in mystery			1
if that 's the case , it would mean the family of a pilot , passenger or crew member responsible would still be eligible for compensation payments			1
the stunning analysis follows reports @entity35 police have made @entity2 's pilot the key focus of their immediate investigation , with officers interviewing captain @entity2 's family and friends about his behaviour and mindset in the days leading up to the flight			1
meanwhile , authorities have again been forced to call off the search for debris , with bad weather hampering their efforts for the second time in just three days			0
shortly after its final voice communication on march 8 , flight @entity2 reportedly climbed suddenly to between 43,000 and 45,000ft where it remained for 23 minutes			2
military radar then picked up the plane flying as low as 5,000ft			2
the distance to the now - defined crash site means the plane must have then climbed to a normal cruising altitude of around 35,000ft before eventually plunging into the southern @entity77 ... family troubles : @entity79 , captain of @entity35 flight @entity2 , with his family one experienced pilot told @entity83 that the sudden climb could have been a tactic to incapacitate the passengers and crew , ruling out a mechanical failure and instead blaming ' deliberate human interaction '			1
he said the drop to 5,000ft could have been to re-pressurise the plane , before climbing again to its normal cruising altitude , before : ' flying to a remote location where you know no one would ever find it			2
that way insurers would still pay out to your loved ones			0
' if the cabin was to be depressurised at 45,000ft , experts say , passengers and crew would only have about 15 seconds of functional consciousness before beginning to pass out			1
any one without access to a bottled oxygen supply - like the one found in the cockpit - would be dead in minutes			1
@entity18 aviation security expert , @entity109 , said that at that height , even the masks that automatically drop from the ceiling - which mix oxygen with cabin air - would only extend consciousness for up to 15 minutes as their flow is n't strong enough to stave off the effects of hypoxia at that altitude			2
' even with the oxygen out , it would only give them 15 minutes or so , ' he said			0
' eventually they 'd pass out even with their masks on			0
' search abandoned : thursday 's salvage mission had to be aborted due to bad weather			2
it 's the second time in three days the planes and boats have been ordered back to base			0
international effort : the search team now includes military from @entity18 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 the high - ranking officer told @entity140 that the investigation 's immediate focus was pilot , saying that nobody else aboard the plane was capable of the maneuvers they now know the plane made shortly before dropping off radar			1
captain @entity2 's son , @entity150 , says he has ' ignored all the speculation ' around his father captain @entity2 's son , @entity150 , today broke his silence , saying he has ' ignored all the speculation ' around his 53 - year - old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to @entity158 from @entity159 19 days ago			1
and the 26 - year - old , captain @entity2 's youngest son , says the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead , insisting they will wait for physical evidence			1
i 've read everything online			0
but i 've ignored all the speculation , ' he told the @entity171			0
' we may not be as close as he travels so much			0
' now , we are just waiting for the right confirmation			0
i will believe it when i see the proof in front of my eyes			0

analysis of @entity2 's final , erratic movements could point to a suicide mission , experts claim
the climb to 45,000ft would have incapacitated passengers and crew in seconds
only someone with a bottled oxygen supply - like the one found in the plane 's cockpit - could have survived
it comes as @entity35 police name captain @entity2 as the focus off their immediate investigation
police are interviewing the pilot of @entity2 's family and friends about his state of mind
a friend of the pilot *yesterday* described him as in ' no fit state to fly '
