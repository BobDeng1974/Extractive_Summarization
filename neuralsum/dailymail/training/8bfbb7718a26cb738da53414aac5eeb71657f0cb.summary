@entity1 lawmakers have questioned president @entity3 's strategy in @entity4 warning that the failure to annihilate @entity7 extremists now could lead to future attacks on @entity10 soil			1
' if he does not go on the offensive against @entity14 , @entity14 , whatever you want guys want to call it , they are coming here , ' @entity12 sen. @entity11 said on @entity19			1
' and if we do get attacked , then he will have committed a blunder for the ages			0
' ' this is turning into , as we had predicted for a long time , a regional conflict which does pose a threat to the security of the @entity10 , ' @entity24 sen. @entity23 told @entity29			1
' what a weak leader , ' @entity31 rep. @entity30 said on @entity33 , adding : ' we 're gon na attack this , but we 're not gon na do this , we 're not gon na do that			1
can you imagine @entity38 or @entity39 or @entity40 [ acting like that ] ? ' president @entity3 selects a club while golfing at @entity43 , in @entity44 , @entity45 , on the island of @entity47 on sunday			1
the president spend his weekend golfing as the humanitarian crisis in @entity4 raged on @entity11 accused @entity3 of not taking seriously the threat the country faces from @entity14 in @entity53 and @entity4			1
' when i look at the map , ' he said , ' i think of the @entity10			0
i think of an @entity10 city in flames because of the terrorists ' ability to operate in @entity53 and @entity4			2
' mr. president , if you do n't adjust your strategy , these people are coming here , ' @entity11 said			1
' what is your strategy to stop these people from attacking the homeland ? they have expressed a desire to do so , ' he pointed out			1
as of monday morning the @entity10 had launched more than a half dozen airstrikes on @entity7 militants camped outside of @entity72 , the capitol of @entity73			0
it also emerged overnight that the @entity75 was arming @entity73 forces fighting @entity14			0
in a statement on saturday president @entity3 said his administration would ' continue to pursue a broader strategy in @entity4 ' to protect @entity10 stationed there from violence and the @entity4 people from mass murder			1
' if these terrorists threaten our facilities or our personnel , we will take action to protect our people , ' he said			0
but @entity23 said that @entity10 's long - term plan in @entity4 can not be made up of reactionary strikes			1
' that 's not a strategy			2
that 's not a policy			0
that is simply a very narrow and focused approach to a problem which is metastasizing as we speak , ' he said			0
if he were commander in chief , @entity23 said he would be arming @entity53 rebels and proving as much military assistance to the @entity73 as possible			0
the 2008 @entity1 presidential nominee said he also would have left some @entity10 troops in @entity4 as well , instead of completely withdrawing them in 2011 like @entity3			1
the resulting situation he said , is ' that there 's no leadership ' in the @entity110 , he said , and ' we are paying a price for it			0
' @entity3 's strategy in @entity4 ' is clearly very , very ineffective , to say the least , ' @entity23 said			1
@entity30 similarly said that @entity3 's decision to leave @entity4 was a fatal mistake			1
' the president , he started this			0
he started this downfall [ of @entity4 ] in 2011 with direct withdraw of @entity10 troops , ' @entity30 said			1
' this president talks about ending the war in @entity4 , all he ended was @entity10 influence in @entity4			0
and that 's a failure , and it 's on his hands			0
' an @entity4 official said on sunday that @entity14 had killed at least 500 followers of the @entity132 religion in the last week , including 40 children , some of whom were buried alive			2
the total number of @entity4 executed by @entity14 since it began it 's rampage is unknown			2
volunteers from @entity140 fighters take up their position as they fight against the militants from the @entity143 in northern @entity4 on sunday			2
the @entity10 military attacked islamic state targets throughout the weekend to aid @entity73 fighters , but @entity1 lawmakers say the @entity3 administration needs to doing more to help the @entity4 destroy @entity14 @entity132 refugees from @entity4 are pictured here on saturday at a temporary camp in @entity152 in south - eastern @entity153			2
the site is currently home to around 350 @entity132 escaping violence by @entity14 militants president @entity3 hit back at critics on saturday claiming that the humanitarian crisis in @entity4 could have been avoided if he had left a residual force in @entity4 two and a half years ago			2
' that entire analysis is bogus and wrong but it gets frequently peddled around here by folks who oftentimes are trying to defend previous policies that they themselves made , ' he said			0
@entity3 explained that he did not sign an agreement with the @entity4 government to allow @entity10 troops to remain in the country because they would n't have received the necessary legal protections			1
' the only difference would be we ’d have a bunch of troops on the ground that would be vulnerable , ' @entity3 said			0
' and however many troops we had , we would have to now be reinforcing , i ’d have to be protecting them , and we ’d have a much bigger job			0
' and probably , we would end up having to go up again in terms of the number of grounds troops to make sure that those forces were not vulnerable			0
' the president placed the blame for the current situation on the @entity4 government , saying that had it not ' alienated ' the @entity189 population in the country , the @entity7 militants would n't have been so successful at destroying the country			2
@entity3 has repeatedly said that until a new , more inclusive government forms in @entity4 , he would not aid the country militarily - a strategy king said threatened the @entity10 ' security			1
' we ca n't ' sit back and let @entity14 attack the @entity10 ' because @entity4 officials did n't do their job , he said			2
minutes after his remarks on saturday about the state of affairs in @entity4 , president @entity3 , first lady @entity200 and their daughter @entity201 flew to the secluded @entity45 island of @entity47 for a two week vacation			1
by the time the @entity10 made four more airstrikes in @entity4 that afternoon , president @entity3 was on the golf course , leading @entity210 sen. @entity209 to dub him the ' absentee president '			1
' i think the president should actually stand up and do his job as commander in chief , should spend less time on the golf course and more time doing the job to which he was elected , ' @entity209 told attendees of the @entity219			0
' i am glad the president is finally demonstrating some leadership , taking the threat from @entity14 seriously , but unfortunately , he ’s following the pattern that has characterized his foreign policy from the beginning of this tenure which he has laid out no clearly defined objective that we ’re trying to accomplish that is key to defending @entity10 national security , ' @entity209 said			0
he went on to accuse @entity3 of ' not providing that leadership			0
' the president is scheduled to appear at a @entity234 fundraiser today in @entity47 before taking the rest of the week off to play golf and spend time with his family			0
next sunday he 'll return to @entity240 for two days to attend what the @entity241 would only describe as ' meetings , ' but he 'll then head back to @entity45 for five more days of vacation .			1

@entity3 's strategy in @entity4 ' is clearly very , very ineffective , to say the least , ' sen. @entity23 told @entity29
' what a weak leader , ' rep. @entity30 said
' what is your strategy to stop these people from attacking the homeland ? ' demanded sen. @entity11
@entity3 is currently on vacation at @entity47 and wo n't return to @entity240 until sunday
