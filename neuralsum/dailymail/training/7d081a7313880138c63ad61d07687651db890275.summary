by @entity0 when @entity3 the giant tortoise fell ill , her keepers were faced with two big problems : how to get all 14 stone of her to the vet – and how to persuade her to take her medicine			1
with a little ingenuity , the combined muscle power of four men and a few sticks of celery , they solved both and @entity3 is now well on the mend			0
the drama began to unfold – at a relaxed pace – when staff at @entity20 noticed that the 32 - year - old tortoise was making a whistling sound when breathing			1
things are looking up : @entity3 , the 32 - year - old tortoise , is checked over by vets at @entity20 after she began suffering breathing problems medicine : the animal - which is classified as ' vulnerable ' - was given antibiotics to help battle the illness with a battery of tests needed , @entity3 , a ‘ gentle and easy - going ’ tortoise , had to be taken to the onsite clinic for the first time			1
staff vet @entity36 said : ‘ it was a question of having four people – somebody on each corner – and lifting her gently by the shell			0
giant : @entity3 has been at the zoo for 11 years and weighs 14 stone getting better : @entity3 is pictured being wheeled to a check - up after developing a nasal infection @entity48 giant tortoises come from the bleak @entity48 in the @entity49 in the @entity50 they are said to live for up to 250 years but no one knows for sure because they have outlived the scientists studying them and proper records have not been kept males grow up to 4ft and weigh 40 stone , females 3ft and 25 @entity60 creatures were plundered by sailors and settlers for their meat @entity64 helped set up a breeding programme but their numbers are still low ' she was put on a trolley and wheeled through the zoo			1
it would have taken a long time if we had waited for her to walk			0
’ once at the clinic , vets were concerned that @entity3 would simply withdraw into her shell , so she was given a full anaesthetic			2
@entity3 , one of six @entity48 giant tortoises at the zoo , also had blood tests , nose swabs and x-rays			2
a nasal infection , caused by a mixture of bacteria , was diagnosed			0
different from a cold , this can be treated with antibiotics and @entity3 , who has been at the zoo for 11 years , was discharged			1
giant tortoises can be stubborn but @entity3 happily takes her medicine			0
mr @entity36 said : ‘ we are able to put the tablets in a line inside a piece of celery , which she comes running for			0
’ now , a fortnight after the trip to the vet , @entity3 ’s breathing is much better and she is expected to make a full recovery			2
' lift ' : vets at the zoo 's on - site clinic move the tortoise onto a treatment table			1

the animal , which weighs 14 stone , was treated by vets at @entity20
was given antibiotics after being run down with breathing problems
she has been at the zoo for 11 years and is described as ' vulnerable '
