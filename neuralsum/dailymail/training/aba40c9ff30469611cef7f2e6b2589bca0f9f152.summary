four years later , mr @entity5 , from @entity9 , has turned his life around and is now a fighting fit bodybuilder after using the sport to beat the eating disorder			1
he now weighs a beefy 18 - stone , has dedicated himself to pursuing a career in the sport and happily munches his way through 5,000 calories a day in order to maintain his new physique			1
recovery : @entity5 weighed less than six stone at the age of 18 but has now recovered to become a bodybuilder speaking about his life - saving passion for the sport , mr @entity5 said : ' i shaved my hair off , took out my piercings and started lifting weights , it was a move that saved my life			1
' his battle against the eating disorder began at the age of 14 , when he was a self - described ' @entity34 ' and began starving himself to fit in			1
' it started when i was about 14 years - old with anorexia and as it progressed it just got uglier , ' he explains			1
' i was an @entity34 kid with long hair and piercings and i was going to be as skinny as i could			1
not eating was part of the fashion , it 's a big thing , it dictates a lifestyle			2
' although he often fainted because of his restricted diet , mr @entity5 managed to convince himself that all was well , despite the danger he was putting himself in			1
' i was disgusted by food , it repulsed me , ' he confesses			2
' i picked up on the sound of people eating			2
if i saw people eating i would wonder how they could do it			2

like punk and grunge , emo is also associated with fashion , in this case low - slung , colourful skinny jeans worn with band t - shirts , multiple piercings and rainbow - coloured hair			1

' for me it was all about being as small as i could			2
it was a form of control			0
' he added : ' it was weird			0
i enjoyed it , i revelled in it			0
it was about pushing myself as far as i could			0
i would pass out through lack of eating but i would convince myself it was fine			0
nobody could convince me otherwise			0
' @entity97 came in the shape of a visit to the gym at the age of 18 on the advice of his doctor and a former girlfriend			0
there he met a strength coach who encouraged him to take up the sport , and after gaining some weight , he began lifting weights in earnest			0
today he eats 5,000 calories a day six days a week and up to 10,000 calories on a sunday when he treats himself to fast food			0
he added : ' you are very alienated with anorexia and although there are people in the gym it is still very much a personal journey			1
' i started by barely being able to lift 5kg because i was so small so i had to first work at putting some meat back on my bones			0
' i started reading body building mags and based my diet around that so would eat things like oats and egg whites but also started eating food like ice cream			0
' it was tough on my stomach because it had been so small but i was determined to put weight on			0
' during the first year of training , mr @entity5 gained 10 stone and managed to achieve second place in his first bodybuilding competition before going on to compete in the @entity142 finals			1
' i 'm fit and healthy and focussing on doing something to my body that does not put my life at risk , ' he added			0
' eating disorders are a bigger problem than people realise and all i would say is try and find something that can give you the same control and satisfaction			0
' for me it was bodybuilding because i need the focus of the training and meals but anything that helps you beat it can only be a good thing			1
