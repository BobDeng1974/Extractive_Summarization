ambulance bosses have been forced to recruit paramedics from @entity2 amid an estimated nationwide shortage of 3,000			1
@entity4 , which covers @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , said it was advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians and 70 emergency care assistants			1
details of the desperate shortage of 999 workers emerged as a leaked memo this week revealed plans to allow ambulance response times for some serious calls to double from eight to 19 minutes amid a severe strain on the nationwide service			0
looking elsewhere : the @entity4 ( pictured ) , which covers @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , is advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians @entity4 confirmed it had been hiring overseas because its recruitment plans had been ‘ challenged ’ by the nationwide shortage of paramedics			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we have been carrying out some international recruitment in @entity2 for paramedics where their qualifications , skills and experience are very similar to our own and meet our own high standards for staff			1
’ the @entity35 said it was also looking at other countries			0
paramedic @entity37 , who works for the service , said : ‘ we can have big delays responding to 999 calls - three , four or five hours is not uncommon - and the pressure on staff is huge			1
’ the news came after the @entity44 announced it had flown to the other side of the world to hire 175 @entity48 paramedics to start in january because of the small number of local applicants			0
@entity51 : there is a nationwide shortage of around 3,000 paramedics according to industry groups ( file photo ) a team spent ten days @entity48 in september interviewing and assessing staff in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
it successfully recruited 175 staff after previously launched a campaign entitled ‘ @entity69 , @entity70 ’ to encourage front line medics to leave @entity48 and work in @entity69			1
@entity71 from the @entity72 estimated that there was a nationwide shortage of between 2,500 and 3,000 paramedics			0
he said although ambulance services did have many foreign workers this was the first time he had heard of official recruitment drives abroad			1
he said : ‘ one of the main problems is insufficient people being trained and recruited			2
‘ there are not enough university programmes to meet the demand			0
‘ it is a lack of workforce planning			0
a lot of trusts run their own courses , train their own people themselves			2
‘ there is also more competition for paramedics , who are now also employed by what used to be @entity95 111 ( formally @entity96 ) , which previously mainly took nurses			0
’ @entity98 , from the union @entity99 , said enough staff should be trained in the @entity101 to meet the @entity95 ' needs			1
she said : ‘ we should not need to recruit from overseas and deprive that country of its own trained staff			2
we have a situation now where there are not enough trained paramedics			0
‘ rising demand is increasing pressure on existing staff , leading to overruns , where staff work longer than their shift , sometimes for hours , and an inability to take appropriate meal breaks			2
‘ this causes exhaustion and impacts on work - life balance , a situation so dire that many staff are leaving the service			2
‘ investment in the training of ambulance staff is a priority			1
recruiting abroad is a short - term fix			2
we need to be investing here to ensure we meet our paramedic needs			0
despite the tough conditions for paramedics here , it would likely be an improvement on working life for most of their @entity2 counterparts			1
pressure : in some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year ( file photo ) paramedics in @entity145 and @entity146 work 37.5 hours a week , starting on a salary between £ 21,388 and £ 27,901 a year which can rise to £ 34,500			0
in @entity2 they earn between £ 4,872 and £ 6,600 a year for a 37 - hour week , although many work twice as many hours and some even triple hours to boost their pay			1
the ambulance service in @entity145 and @entity146 is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since april			0
in some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year			0
officials blame an increasing tendency of patients to dial 999 first instead of trying to arrange an appointment with a gp			0
@entity4 said agency workers were currently filling gaps while they were recruiting new staff and there was no risk to patients			1
a spokesman for the @entity169 accepted that in some areas there was not enough staff to meet increased demand			2
but he said : ‘ ambulances are making nearly 2,000 more emergency journeys every day than 2010 , which is why we ’ve employed almost 2,000 extra paramedics and provided £ 50million additional funding just this year to keep the service sustainable			0

@entity4 hiring *290* staff *members* from abroad
@entity2 is targeted because qualifications ' are very similar to our own '
@entity186 : we should be training more people in @entity101 , not looking elsewhere
