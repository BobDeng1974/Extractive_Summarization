by @entity0 the bus tour of a city is one of the great clichés of travel			1
and perhaps one of the most dreary ways to see a major metropolis			2
you plonk yourself on a seat by the window , and listen to an unenthusiastic guide drone on about some monument or other , in a voice that says they ’ve done this spiel about a thousand times before			0
which , of course , they have			0
but there is nothing dreary – and certainly nothing clichéd – about the new bus tour which is set to bring drama , and just a hint of danger , to the streets of @entity28			1
more than your average tour : @entity28 is now offering the ' samurai and @entity31 ' feel the pain : costumed actors will stage battles between samurai warriors and ninjas as part of the tour tourists who like their travel to come with a little flair can now book themselves onto a ‘ samurai and @entity31 ’ jaunt around the @entity45 capital – a one - hour itinerary that involves flying fists and roars of pain as costumed figures throw themselves into combat			1
launched by @entity53 – @entity45 ’s biggest bus tour operator – in conjunction with an events company @entity56 , the ‘ safari ’ will offer visitors a taste of @entity45 history that goes far beyond a dusty map in a museum , or a quick docu - film on the country ’s military past			1
@entity67 - footed : ' fights ' will take place outside the bus , with tourists able to look on from the safety of their seats stealthy living : the tour will attempt to bring @entity45 's medieval history to life for a modern generation the first half of the tour will be a standard route through some of @entity28 ’s key areas			1
but once the bus enters @entity83 – a part of the city famed for its temples and visible heritage – things will get a little feisty			1
and , if you will , a little ' fisty '			0
street performers dressed as both samurais and ninjas will burst out of the shadows and leap into battle , assailing each other with a range of acrobatic kicks and athletic blows			0
parts will be played by actors from the @entity28 pantomime group @entity102			0
have some of that : @entity104 were the knights of 16th century @entity45 , and carried the traditional katana sword in your face , mate : ninjas were covert figures - though there is nothing too covert about this fight here tourists will look on from the bus as the action unfolds outside			2
the organisers hope that the idea will prove popular with visitors who want a little more from their sight - seeing			0
‘ it ’s theatre in motion , ’ says @entity122 of @entity56			0
‘ as the samurai and ninja battle in @entity83 , passengers can enjoy it from inside the bus			1
’ the best tickets for the tour – seats with the clearest views – will cost around £ 40			2
the tour is not entirely unprecedented			2
@entity135 currently offers a trip called @entity137 , which runs on a similar basis – with theatrical performances taking place along the route			0
scream if you want to see more : the ' fights ' will take place in the streets of @entity28 's @entity83 district there 's more where that came from : the tour is described by its organisers as ' theatre in motion ' ninjas and samurai are a fundamental part of @entity45 history			1
samurai warriors were the @entity45 equivalent of the knights of medieval @entity161 – guided by a strict code of conduct , and clad in thick suits of armour , usually made of iron or leather , bound by small straps			1
in the 16th century , many of them carried the katana – the traditional curved sword which has become a recognisable symbol of @entity45 lore			2
ninjas , by contrast , were covert figures – mercenaries and spies who were allowed to operate between the rules , their effectiveness based on stealth and invisibility			0
