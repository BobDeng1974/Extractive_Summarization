seventy - five years ago , the government cut 65 - year - old @entity1 a check			1
it was numbered 00 - 000 - 001 - the first @entity5 payout			2
@entity1 , of @entity6 , @entity7 , did n't realize it at the time , but her check helped launch the granddaddy of all entitlement programs			1
she had only paid three years ' worth of payroll taxes before retiring but by the time of her death in 1975 at age 100 , she collected $ 22,888.92 from @entity5 monthly benefits			1
it was numbered 00 - 000 - 001 - the first @entity5 payout - here she is pictured in 1950 holding a @entity5 check for $ 41.30 @entity1 , who never married and had no children , said that the returns took her by surprise			1
' it was n't that i expected anything			0
but i knew i 'd been paying for something called @entity5 , ' she 's quoted as saying			2
@entity1 went on to secure a place in @entity33 history as the first to receive a monthly benefit @entity5 check			1
she received the check , amounting to $ 22.54 , on january 31 , 1940			1
today , even as its future lies in financial uncertainty , many consider @entity5 one of government 's biggest successes			1
but in its infancy it was hardly a sure thing , and not well understood by many , including @entity1			1
@entity1 was born on a farm two miles outside @entity6 , then a mill town and now a ski town , in the heart of the @entity50			2
future president @entity51 was three years ahead of her at the @entity52 , now a museum			0
you 've got mail : @entity1 had only paid three years ' worth of payroll taxes before retiring but by the time of her death in 1975 at age 100 , she collected $ 22,888.92 from @entity5 monthly benefits ( above , in 1966 ) a monthly check for you : a government poster urging people to apply for their social security account numbers , which features a hand holding a check in front of the @entity69 later , she worked as a secretary for the @entity7 law firm of a @entity6 lawyer who had been @entity51 's attorney general			1
in early november 1939 , she passed by the government office in the larger city of @entity76 and decided to pop in to ask about @entity5			2
while there she was urged to apply for benefits , not realizing she 'd get the first check			2
that january check was for $ 22.54 , a little less than the $ 25.75 that the agency had been deducting from her paycheck in the previous three years			2
near the end of her life , when she was living with a niece , she told a reporter that the payments ' come pretty near paying for my expenses			0
' and that was the idea			0
' it is hard for us to imagine what life was like for seniors and the disabled before @entity5 , ' said @entity7 's independent sen. @entity98 , a vocal supporter of the system			1
new age : @entity5 has undergone significant changes since @entity1 received her first check , including the addition of disability benefits in 1956 on the 10th anniversary in 1950 , there was six - minute movie made by the @entity108			1
a 1955 article called @entity1 , known around @entity6 as ' @entity110 , ' ' a kindly , likable , practical and placid woman whose ability to derive deep satisfaction from simple , wholesome living has eased her through life			2
' in 1960 , she received greetings from across the country			0
she became the subject of more media attention on her 100th birthday shortly before her death			0
these days , @entity7 has a reputation for liberalism , with some likening its generous social safety net to socialism			0
but back then , it had a reputation as a staunch anti-new deal state in addition to being the home of @entity51 , a @entity130 and proponent of small government			0
in 1936 , voters in @entity7 and @entity134 were the ones who did n't support president @entity137 for a second term			0
but a progressive wing of the @entity140 was beginning to emerge			0
@entity142 task : clerical workers sorting @entity5 cards in @entity145 , @entity146 , in 1936 big move : president @entity137 signs the @entity148 on august 4 1935 in @entity149 @entity1 , a staunch @entity130 , did not support @entity137			1
in 1970 , she told @entity150 that she did n't think there should be any more increases in @entity5 payments			1
' it 's been raised as far as it ought to go , ' she said			0
' every time they raise it , they raise the amount taken away from the working people who pay into it , and it 's just getting to be too much of a burden			0
' the @entity108 , first led by former @entity165 gov. @entity164 , insists it was just coincidence that the first check went to a @entity7 resident			0
@entity5 has undergone significant changes since @entity1 received her first check , including the addition of disability benefits in 1956			1
today , 59 million retired workers , spouses , disabled workers and survivors get monthly payments averaging $ 1,194			1
the latest overhaul came in 1983 , when @entity5 was on the brink of insolvency			0
@entity181 increased payroll taxes , cut benefits and gradually extended the age when retirees can claim full benefits			0
the changes shored up @entity5 's finances so it could absorb the initial wave of retiring baby boomers			0
today , @entity5 's trust funds hold more than $ 2.7 trillion in special @entity193 bonds			1
but unless @entity181 acts , @entity5 's disability fund will run dry in 2016 and the retirement fund will be depleted in 2034 , according to projections by the trustees who oversee the programs .			2
