by @entity0 published : 01:18 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 09:04 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 , street name ice , is known for its terrible side effects - psychosis , paranoia , ‘ meth mouth ’ in which a user ’s teeth decay and crack , suicidal and homicidal thoughts , and sores , which result from a user picking at their skin because they feel like bugs are crawling all over it			1
but it seems that for a large number of young women , one side effect makes all the others worth it – weight loss			1
an estimated 30 percent of female meth users take the ' @entity25 drug ' or do not want to give it up because it helps them to lose weight			1
despite the harmful side effects of the drug , one third of women who use crystal meth report weight loss as a key reason they take it @entity38 * took up crystal meth as a teenager			1
she entered a treatment program in her native @entity42 and was able to quit the drug			0
‘ she managed to abstain for many , many years , ’ said @entity44 , the executive director of @entity45 in @entity46 , who worked with @entity38 in the program			0
after quitting , @entity38 , now 24 , gained 35 pounds ( 15kg )			0
her unhappiness about her weight gain was a key factor in her taking the drug up again			1
‘ she returned heavily back to crystal and a huge part of that was body image , ’ said mr @entity44			0
mr @entity44 , who has worked with addicts for many years , says that crystal methamphetamine , which has received significant attention in the last few years due to the television show @entity25 , is still a ‘ niche drug ’			1
but it is one that it is seeing a resurgence in recent years , particularly among young women			2
unlike most drugs , which have more male addicts than female ones , mr @entity44 estimates that 60 percent of crystal meth users are female			2
‘ you ’ll find that a lot of young women take it because it suppresses the appetite , ’ he said			2
crystal meth differs from other drugs in that a higher percentage of its users are female than male side effects of crystal meth use include psychosis , paranoia , decaying and cracked teeth , suicidal and homicidal thoughts , and ' formication ' , the sensation that bugs are crawling all over your skin mr @entity44 estimates that among young female addicts , 30 percent use the drug , which is a powerful appetite suppressant and allows people to function for days without needing to eat , in part because of its weight loss effects			1
a 2011 study from the @entity97 in @entity98 found that 30 percent of female meth addicts reported that weight loss or weight maintenance was a key factor in them taking the drug			1
because the body has been starved during the period of drug - taking , after someone has kicked their drug habit the body responds by storing fat in anticipation of future periods of starvation			1
because of this , ex-addicts , like @entity38 who gained 35 pounds after quitting , often quickly regain any weight they lost after kicking their meth habit			0
for many of these young women , the fear of gaining weight is a serious obstacle to them seeking treatment and a key reason they take up the drug again after quitting , as users try to balance drug use and body image			2
unlike almost all illicit drugs , more women are addicted to ice than men ‘ the thinking is : “ i look a lot better when i use crystal , if i can just find that perfect balance between still using , but not using too much , ” ’ said mr @entity44			0
methamphetamine has been prescribed by doctors as a weight loss since the 1970s and is still prescribed as a medication for the treatment of adhd and obesity in the form of the drug @entity3 ( methamphetamine hydrochloride ) in the @entity148			1
there are strict controls in place around the @entity3 ’s use , which people are told should not be used for more than a few weeks at a time			0
a @entity156 report released in 2008 reported that 24.7 million people worldwide used crystal methamphetamine during 2006 - 2007			0
in the @entity160 - speaking world , @entity98 has the highest use of illicit methamphetamine			0
around 2.5 percent of @entity98 over the age of 14 - approximately 500,000 people - used the drug in the last year			2
this is three times higher than use in the @entity148 and @entity42 ( 0.5 percent ) and the @entity169 ( 1 percent ) .			0

weight loss a factor in meth - taking for 30 percent of female addicts
ice suppresses the user *'s* appetite , but can also lead to psychosis and death
*experts* say there is a resurgence of the ' @entity25 drug ' among women
