by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boxer @entity2 believes the sport 's world governing body will vote to bring back headguards after a @entity8 campaign marred by a series of high - profile cuts			1
@entity2 breezed into his second consecutive light - flyweight final with a unanimous decision win over @entity14 's @entity13			1
but earlier in the day he watched his friend @entity15 scrape through against @entity17 @entity16 on a technical decision after sustaining a bad cut over his right eye from an accidental headbutt			1
safety : @entity23 's @entity2 ( pictured ) believes that helmets will have to be brought back to the sport by the authorities dangerous : several boxers , including @entity15 ( left ) , have suffered vicious cuts without helmets and @entity23 lightweight @entity30 also required treatment to a gash beneath his left eye after a straightforward win over @entity35 of @entity36			1
@entity15 in particular now faces a race against time to be fit for saturday 's bantamweight final against @entity40 's @entity39 , and @entity2 believes a u-turn on the decision is inevitable			1
@entity2 said : ' i think headguards will be back			2
it 's great to see them off because it 's better to watch , but it 's impossible to fight so many times in so few days without headguards on - it 's ridiculous			1
' @entity15 , who also suffered a cut to the top of his head in his first round win over @entity56 , is convinced he will be able to compete in the final			2
' i felt the cut straight away but it was cleaned up well by the doctor and i will be in the ring tomorrow , ' @entity15 said			0
' i 've never been cut on the face or the head in my life until this tournament so it 's a bit unfortunate , but i 've had it glued and it will be okay			0
' i was happy with the way i boxed before it was stopped and i am just happy to be in the final			0
tomorrow is going to be a golden day			0
' arms aloft : @entity30 ( left ) also suffered cuts in his bout before prevailing , again heightening safety worries the 19 - year - old @entity73 produced another composed performance to see off @entity35 and book a final against @entity77 's @entity76			1
@entity73 said : ' i 'm young but it does n't mean anything			0
@entity2 and @entity15 have helped me big time and you will see the best from me on saturday night			2
' @entity83 moved through to face @entity85 champion @entity84 in the women 's flyweight final			2
the @entity3 21 - year - old came through against tough @entity90 @entity89 , edging the final two rounds with her cleaner , counter-punching style in order to make sure on the scorecards			0
@entity83 said : ' months ago i said my dream was to fight @entity84 in the @entity8 final and when i go to bed tonight i will dream of that gold medal hanging round my neck			0
' i know if i perform to the best of my ability i can beat her			0
she is the golden girl and i 'm only a baby but in the ring it 's a different story			0
' @entity23 light - welterweight @entity105 was outpointed by @entity106 and light - heavyweight @entity107 also lost on points to @entity109 of @entity110			1
welterweight @entity111 looked unlucky to drop a split decision to @entity114 of @entity90 , and middleweight @entity115 was beaten by @entity90 's @entity116 ( crrct ) at middleweight			0
@entity118 was outpointed by @entity120 's @entity119 in the women 's lightweight division , leaving @entity23 with four finalists and five definite bronze medals			2
power : @entity2 ( right ) throws a punch during his victory over @entity14 's @entity128 ( left )			1

@entity2 beat @entity14 's @entity130 to reach the light - flyweight final
@entity15 scraped through after suffering a bad cut over his right eye
@entity23 lightweight @entity30 also required treatment
@entity2 said boxing is ' better to watch ' without headguards '
but he says it is ' impossible to fight ' several fights together without them
