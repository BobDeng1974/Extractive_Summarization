by @entity0 published : 08:51 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 09:14 est , 28 december 2012 @entity2 was behind radical proposals to end free healthcare and schooling in @entity6 which proved so contentious they sparked what was described as a ' riot ' in cabinet , newly - released documents reveal			1
a 1982 cabinet memorandum by the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , released today under the @entity14 under the 30 - year - rule , details plans for a massive scaling back of public services			0
according to her memoirs , mrs @entity2 was ' horrified ' when she first saw the paper which was never seriously considered by her or any of her ministers			1
@entity22 back the frontiers : mrs @entity2 and her then chancellor sir @entity24 commissioned a think tank to come up with radical plans to cut public spending , newly - released documents reveal she wrote : ' i pointed out that it would almost certainly be leaked and give a totally false impression			1
' it was all a total nonsense			0
' however records show that not only was the memorandum fully considered at an extended cabinet discussion on september 9 , 1982 , but that mrs @entity2 and her then chancellor sir @entity24 had requested the @entity13 to come up with such radical suggestions in the first place			1
according to @entity38 , who was the energy secretary at the time , the incendiary report sparked ' the nearest thing to a cabinet riot in the history of the @entity2 administration			1
' despite mrs @entity2 's public denunciation of the report , it was , in reality , far from the product of a renegade group of radical right - wingers acting purely off their own initiative			1
according to a report in the @entity54 , the newly released documents show how it had been commissioned by @entity2 and mr @entity24 with the latter telling the pm : ' we should not be inhibited at this stage by such considerations as the alleged impossibility of change			1
@entity38 said the report nearly prompted a riot in the cabinet ' a discussion of this kind would pave the way for some major strategic decisions affecting our programmes as a government for the next parliament			2
' one of the authors was @entity76 's current advisor on crime and policing , @entity79 , who , in a background paper for the education section , proposed cutting 25 per cent of state - school teachers			2
a copy of the report was subsequently leaked to the press which proposed the introduction of education vouchers , an ending state - funded higher education , freezing welfare benefits and an insurance - based health service similar to the @entity93 system			2
but what was not known at the time was that this was merely a watered - down version of the real thing which went far further			0
the original version included such radical proposals as compulsory charges for schooling as well as a ' drastic reduction in resources going to the public sector '			0
there would also be no deductions in university fees and a breaking of the link between welfare benefits and prices			0
but by far the paper 's most contentious proposal was to end the state provision of healthcare which would have effectively meant an end to the @entity118			2
it reads : ' it is therefore worth considering aiming over a period to end the state provision of healthcare for the bulk of the population , so that medical facilities would be privately owned and run and those seeking healthcare would be required to pay for it			0
' those who could not afford to pay would then have their charges met by the state , via some form of rebating or reimbursement			0
' mentally handicapped or elderly patients requiring long term institutional care who ' clearly could not afford to pay ' , would be the only exceptions .			0

she and chancellor sir @entity24 commissioned confidential report
it suggested ending free healthcare and the introduction of school fees
it proved so contentious it sparked what was described as a ' riot ' in cabinet
new documents *contradict* @entity2 's own account in her memoirs
