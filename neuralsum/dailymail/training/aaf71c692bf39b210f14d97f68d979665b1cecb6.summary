@entity0 showed how pleased he is to be back in the @entity2 squad after his first call - up from boss @entity4 by posting a smiling image with his team - mates , including some of his closest rivals for a place in the team , on @entity10			1
former @entity11 manager @entity4 left @entity0 out of the first two squads of his reign and after including him for this international window has made it clear the @entity18 striker 's place at training , let alone in games , is far from safe			1
but @entity0 appears to be singing from the appropriate hymn book in the lead - up to the @entity2 's key @entity24 qualifier against @entity25 in @entity26 on sunday			1
' great guys ! amazing football players , ' @entity0 ( second left ) captions this image with rival @entity32 strikers @entity34 ( left ) , @entity35 ( second right ) along with former @entity26 team - mate @entity36 he posted a shot of himself with fellow strikers @entity34 ( @entity39 ) and @entity35 ( @entity26 ) , along with @entity36 , another former @entity26 team - mate			1
' friends , ' he captioned the image			0
' let 's follow them ! great guys ! amazing football players			1
' the post is a far cry from @entity0 's cheeky jesture at the @entity46 when he filled a @entity48 album with stickers of himself for the amusement of his @entity52 followers after his goal in @entity32 's 2 - 1 win over @entity55			2
after not hitting the target in the next two matches which saw @entity32 bow out in the group stage and @entity61 and @entity62 progress , there was a backlash of sorts from his senior team - mates			0
@entity18 striker @entity0 is happy to be in the @entity32 mix again after his first call - up by @entity4 @entity68 said : ' we need real men , not @entity48 stickers or characters			1
these are of no use to the national team			0
' goalkeeper @entity76 added : ' on the pitch , you see who people really are or are not			0
' @entity0 became a scapegoat some say after that ill - fated campaign in @entity83 , but defender @entity84 spoke in support of the talented if inconsistent forward as @entity32 prepared for sunday 's match and said there was no issue between @entity0 and the squad			1
@entity0 ( centre ) is with the @entity2 ahead of sunday 's @entity24 qualifier against @entity25 ' there is nothing to mend , ' he said			1
' the coach has made his choice and there is nothing to add			0
' things went badly in @entity83 but we have put a lid on that			0
' i understand that it is important for the media to know how many times @entity0 goes to the bathroom , how often he sneezes and how many times he has called his mother			2
@entity0 does n't hold back ( left ) and seemingly attempts to trip @entity109 ( right ) at training in @entity111 @entity112 denies @entity32 rift ' but @entity0 is as good as @entity68 , @entity76 and the newcomers			2
what is important is that on sunday we will be at one			0
' @entity4 , who led @entity11 to three @entity118 titles in a row before replacing @entity120 after the @entity46 debacle , has put the ball firmly in @entity0 's court as to whether his stay with the @entity32 set - up is a short or long term			1
“ if he does as i say , then good , he could be on the team or on the bench or indeed in the grandstand , ' @entity4 said			2
' if he does n’t , well then the doors here at @entity132 ( @entity134 team training centre ) are revolving			0
you can come in and you can go out			0
we wo n’t be seeing you anymore and @entity135			0
