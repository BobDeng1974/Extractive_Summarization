a blind man was left ' completely embarrassed and humiliated ' after staff at his local @entity2 refused him entry with his guide dog			1
@entity5 , 36 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , walked into his town 's @entity2 and an employee shouted from behind the counter that he would have to leave his guide dog @entity11 outside if he wanted to be served			1
even when mr @entity5 explained his two - year - old @entity13 was a guide dog , the employee allegedly still insisted he should be left outside			1
he said he was left feeling ' angry and shocked ' mr @entity5 said : ' i was left feeling so angry and shocked			1
it is unacceptable that i should be made to feel like i had done something wrong by going to the @entity2 with my guide dog			1
in this day and age there should be more awareness than that			0
' he added : ' luckily a couple of customers heard him and said he was n't allowed to do it because i had a guide dog and that he would have to let me in			2
he was told a few times and was n't happy about it			0
' mr @entity5 , who had gone to the @entity2 to top up his electric meter with his payment card , was eventually served by the employee after a ten minute standoff			1
he said : ' he did serve me in the end			0
i think he only served me because the other customers interjected			2
you could tell they were angry and a couple shouted " you ca n't do that , he has a guide dog "			2
' the @entity2 in @entity6 , @entity7 , where mr @entity5 was told he had to leave his guide dog outside mr @entity5 was born with glaucoma , a condition which affects eyesight as a result of pressure built up behind the eye , but in the last 12 months has seen a radical decline in his sight			1
he now has only 30 per cent vision in one eye which means he ca n't work and struggles with everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning			1
the 36 - year - old , who lives alone , said : ' i find it difficult doing everyday tasks at home as it is			0
making a meal is tricky as i have to make sure it is cooked and cleaning is quite hard because i ca n't see dust and dirt			0
under the @entity73 , people with disabilities have the same right to services supplied by shops , banks , hotels , libraries , pubs , taxis and restaurants as everyone else			0
service providers also have to make ' reasonable adjustments ' for guide dog and assistance dog owners which might mean offering extra help , and this includes allowing guide dogs and assistance dogs into all public places with their owners			2
' it takes quite a lot to go out to the shops as it is and so to be made to feel that i ca n't even go to the @entity2 to simply pay a bill is ridiculous			0
' mr @entity5 said he has ' never experienced anything like this before ' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular @entity2 has happened			1
he added : ' this incident has really knocked my confidence and made me think if i ca n't take @entity11 to the @entity2 , will this happened again at the shops or a caf√© ? it was really embarrassing and humiliating			0
' so angered was mr @entity5 by the incident that he went straight to a nearby library and lodged an official complaint with the @entity2			1
he also contacted @entity113 , which has been in contact with the @entity2			0
sorry : the @entity2 has issued an apology ' for any distress caused ' following the incident a spokesman for @entity119 said : ' we 're always saddened when we hear about a shop or another service provider refusing access to a guide dog owner			2
the @entity73 makes it illegal to deny access to a guide dog owner			2
we are always happy to work with the @entity2 , or any other organisation to help them understand their duties under the @entity129			0
' mr @entity5 said : ' i want a written apology from the @entity2 and assurance this will never happen to me or any other guide dog user again			1
' it is totally unacceptable and they should have greater awareness			0
' having posted the incident on @entity139 he said he had received numerous comments in support of his complaint			0
' one gentleman said that if that is the way the @entity2 deals with a disabled person he would never come into the @entity2 again , ' said mr @entity5 , who has had @entity11 for seven months and says he 's his best friend			1
he has called the @entity150 employee 's response to his guide dog ' outdated '			1
' it is clearly an outdated view of things			0
i think something needs to be done to educate people that if you have a guide dog it should not stop you from getting about and should n't stop you from doing the things that everyone else gets to do , ' mr @entity5 said			1
' i was determined to get this into the public eye because it probably does happen too often and happening just once is too many times			0
' a spokesman for the @entity2 said : ' @entity2 policy is to allow guide dogs and other assistance dogs into branches and we would like to apologise for any distress caused			0
' @entity6 postmaster mr @entity174 said : ' i have spoken to @entity5 and arranged for him to come back into the shop			2
any misunderstanding between @entity5 and my staff will be rectified			2
