by @entity0 at the age of 11 @entity2 watched a gang of masked @entity5 terrorists smash down the door of his family 's @entity8 home and demanded to see his mother @entity11			1
they dragged her through the door as her children clung on to her legs and tried to fight the gunmen off			1
it was the last time they saw their mother alive			2
a week later , a man who identified himself as being from the @entity5 called at the @entity23 ' council home			2
he handed the children their mother 's purse and wedding ring , saying : ' i was told to deliver this			1
' @entity30 ( left ) with three of her children before she vanished in 1972 @entity31 holds a family photograph showing her mother @entity33 , at home in @entity35 , @entity36 unbeknown to her ten children , @entity30 had been taken to a beach with her hands tied behind her back and shot through the back of her head			1
since then @entity2 and his other siblings have lived in the hope that one day the murders would be brought to justice			1
then in 2003 her remains were accidentally discovered at a beach in @entity49 in 2003			2
tests showed she had been shot in the back of the head			2
the discovery proved to be a key turning point in her children 's quest for the truth			1
@entity30 was abducted from her council flat off the @entity59 in 1972 when neighbours informed @entity5 leaders she was a @entity62 sympathiser after she was seen comforting a soldier shot and wounded outside her home			1
soon after her act of kindness to the soldier , mrs @entity30 was beaten and found wandering the streets dazed and bleeding			1
@entity70 , president of @entity71 , speaking at a conference in @entity73 removing her body : the mother of ten 's body is removed from an area near @entity80 beach in @entity49 funeral : the family of @entity2 carry her coffin into church - 31 years after she was abducted and murdered her children , then aged from six to 16 , helped clean up her wounds at home			1
but they did not have time to heal			2
less than 24 hours later , more than a dozen figures , some wearing bala - clavas , arrived at the @entity82 home and burst through the door demanding to see ' mammy '			1
she became one of the so - called ' disappeared ' , of whom there were at least 16 @entity5 murder victims who had been buried at secret locations			0
@entity31 ( right ) and @entity100 , daughters of @entity30 walk along hand in hand waiting for news near the second burial place at @entity105 car park in 2003 a decision was taken by the @entity5 in 1972 to stop dumping the mutilated bodies of alleged traitors on the streets of @entity8 as a grim warning to others			1
with a new breed of younger , ' modernising ' figures emerging within the @entity5 , epitomised by the bespectacled @entity70 , it was decided that execut - ed ' traitors ' would be quietly disposed of in bogs and beaches along ire - land 's coastline			2
amid @entity5 fears that the family might go to the police , the then 11 - year - old @entity2 was abducted by terrorist thugs himself			0
he was beaten and had a gun held to his head until he agreed he had not seen his mother being abducted			0
the children fended for themselves until @entity2 and a younger brother were caught stealing @entity128 confessed all to police — and the children were promptly split up and put in different care homes			2
@entity134 @entity133 silhouetted against the evening sky at @entity137 car park in @entity49 in an interview with the @entity139 recently , @entity2 , now 52 , said the inter-vening years had destroyed the lives of his siblings , who had been tor - tured by memories and had sought escape in drink or drugs			0
' @entity146 does n't heal , ' he said			0
' the pain does n't go away			0
there is not a day that goes by when i do n't ask myself why i did n't do more			0
i know i was just a wee boy , but i still ask myself if i could have saved her			0
' they took my mother from her house			0
to bring her down to a beach with her hands tied behind her back and to put a gun to the back of her head and shoot her — that was a war crime and the people responsible should be brought to @entity166 [ before the war crimes court ]			0
the scene outside @entity170 @entity169 holding centre this evening where @entity71 leader @entity70 is being questioned by officers investigating the 1972 murder of west @entity8 woman @entity30 he added : ' at the time all we had was each other			1
but i saw my brothers and sisters only about four or five times in the next six years			0
we became strangers to each other			0
everybody has had their problems in different ways			0
' when the @entity5 eventually confessed to abducting and killing her , they claimed it was because she was a ' tout ' who was passing information to the @entity191			0
the @entity2 family has always insisted that their mother 's only in - volvement with the @entity191 was that she once gave succour to an injured squaddie			2
last year @entity11 's children received a huge breakthrough when 11 clandes - tine tapes recorded by @entity201 and loyalist paramilitaries , which had languished for ten years in the archives of the @entity203 in @entity204 in the @entity205 , were handed over to the @entity206 - ern @entity36			1
they include an admission from @entity208 , one of the @entity5 's most in - famous terrorists , that she ferried @entity2 's 37 - year - old mother to the @entity211 where she was tortured , tied up and shot in the head			1
and she asserted it was @entity70 who sanctioned the murder			0
@entity208 refused to enlarge on why @entity70 ordered mrs @entity30 's execu - tion , but commented : ' you do n't deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person , as she was , but you do deserve to die if you are an informer			1
par - ticularly in a war			0
that is the @entity201 way			0
' for the @entity2 children , their mother 's death blighted their lives for ever			1
but perhaps now justice is at last in sight for them			2

in 1972 , terrorists smashed their way into @entity30 's home
they dragged her through the door as her children clung on
since then her children have lived in hope that justice will be done
