@entity0 has backed @entity1 to finally live up to his @entity3 hype now that @entity4 are not considered a one - man team			1
the @entity4 striker has flopped in his two previous trips to the sport ’s biggest event , failing to score in @entity10 in 2006 or @entity11 four years ago			2
@entity12 has since been placed on the emerging talents of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 ahead of the @entity3 in @entity17 and @entity0 , who was part of @entity4 ’s squads for both tournaments , expects @entity1 to flourish in the shadows			1
main man : @entity1 will be @entity4 's star at this summer 's @entity3 , claims @entity0 ‘ the last two @entity25 have been all about if @entity1 stays fit then we are going to win it , ’ the @entity24 striker said			1
‘ the pressure was ridiculous on him			2
‘ but now we have other players in the squad - i ca n’t even remember @entity1 being mentioned too much in the lead up to this @entity3			1
‘ i think taking a bit of pressure of him and letting him enjoy his football can only be a good thing			2
’ @entity0 was on the fringes of contention to appear at a third @entity3 , having scored 22 goals for @entity4 in 42 appearances			1
but he admitted he had no issues with being overlooked by @entity45 and went on to endorse the selection of an inexperienced squad , claiming the lack of scars from previous campaigns would be beneficial			1
he said : ‘ i called which strikers would go ( @entity1 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 ) weeks ago as i felt they were the ones who are the most in - form			1
all four of them deserve to go			2
all smiles : @entity24 striker @entity0 had a formidable record in front of goal for the @entity4 what a duo ! @entity1 and @entity0 teamed up together for @entity4 during the 2006 @entity3 ‘ my advice to any of the lads going to their first @entity3 would be to go and enjoy it and take it all in if you can			1
it can be a blur			2
‘ people are watching every single game at the @entity3 and you are under the microscope			1
‘ what is good about the squad at the minute is there are a lot of young players and it is a bit different			0
hopefully they will go into the tournament with less fear and enjoy it			0
’ the 33 - year - old added : ‘ i think @entity53 can light up the tournament			0
he ’s had an unbelievable season			0
those @entity86 players , especially @entity53 and @entity15 , seem to be playing with so much freedom			0
‘ i do think the lack of experience can help the players			0
i genuinely do believe that			0
they do not know what to expect and will go out there and continue what they have been doing this season			0
‘ they wo n’t have respect for people and just go out there and do what they know they can do			0
it will certainly benefit us			0

@entity1 will be key for @entity45 's side at the @entity3
@entity110 has *struggled* on the biggest stage before
@entity0 expects @entity1 to flourish leading the line
