by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 9 november 2013 updated : 19:30 est , 9 november 2013 brother and sister @entity1 and @entity3 who run @entity4 in @entity5 i ’m in the rudest cafe in the @entity8			1
it is called @entity10 , in @entity5			1
it ’s pouring , and cold , i ’m hungry , and there are lots of walkers afoot in fluorescent waterproofs			1
therefore , i ’m not in a forgiving mood			1
the proprietors , @entity18 , 24 , and his sister , @entity3 , 33 , made headlines last week because of reviews posted on @entity22 complaining of ‘ hostile ’ staff and an ‘ unwelcoming ’ attitude			1
they were on the tv news , accused of throwing forks at customers , and were being compared to @entity28 at his most dictatorial			1
the cafe is small , with vintage @entity31 chairs , prints on the wall and lots of balls of wool			1
my friend sat down , and i went up to order			1
‘ do you have scones ? ’ i asked the newly notorious @entity3			1
she looked me in the eye			1
‘ yes , we do ! ’ ‘ ah , but do they have dried fruit in them ? ’ ‘ yes , but we could take them out ? i have tweezers ! ’ ‘ no , that ’s ok			1
can i have coffee with almond milk ? ’ ‘ of course ! ’ this was too much			1
like finding out that escaped terror suspect @entity52 ( what unimaginative parents ! ) wore a burqa because he really wants a sex change and to make pots			2
unlike in @entity57 , where they take your money before they have even begun to steam the non-organic milk for your latte , i was allowed to take my coffee and tea on trust			2
when i went up to pay later , even though i was below the minimum card spend of £ 10 , @entity3 decided to waive the rule , and thus avoid me having to make a wet trudge to the cashpoint			2
she did n’t even ask whether i had a @entity71 card ! i asked why she and her brother have been so demonised			2
‘ @entity1 is a quiet lad , ’ she said			2
‘ i have n’t really thrown a fork			2
and when i said that we in the @entity75 have a healthy respect for a good old - fashioned surly disposition , i did n’t expect it to go viral			2
the quirky cafe in @entity5 , which according to @entity0 , is a delight ‘ @entity81 came in today , and i told them , “ people are not allowed to say anything these days			1
you say one thing out of turn , that ’s meant to be a joke , and you are vilified			2
” ’ this ‘ trial by the people ’ , where anyone is allowed to trash your reputation online , is the opposite of democracy : it ’s not free speech , it is conviction and sentencing by the malevolent			0
i ’m reminded of the brilliant film @entity98 , where @entity99 thought police monitored your every move			0
i ’m getting a bit tired of this			0
i was at a fashion event last week and met many , many 20 - something bloggers : over-confident young women with no training , who thrust business cards into my hand			0
how on earth do you earn a living , i asked one			0
‘ oh , we are paid by brands to mention their products , or tweet photos of them			0
’ so , the internet has become home to the worst sort of journalism : prs posing as critics			0
no delineation between advert and editorial			0
what staggers me is that these young women , and the people who post negative reviews about a family - run cafe , have no self - doubt			1
so , everyone is afraid , which is why you get columns that do n’t stick up for factory - farmed animals , in case the author is deemed to be anti poor people			0
we professional writers are afraid not of letting down those without a voice , but of inflaming the vocal and the outraged and the organised : mums , for example			0
it ’s all currying favour , like the outraged woman writing last week about how expensive and elitist @entity153 is for selling an £ 85 coat			0
she would never tell you that she lives in a vicarage and has staff , a rich husband and loads of money in the bank : that would spoil the populist conceit			0
i wish @entity3 from @entity5 had indeed thrown a fork at a difficult customer who was already penning a post on her @entity168			1
@entity0 complained to @entity169 and said she was leaving the bank after nearly 40 years @entity0 used to love @entity172 carbonated fizzy water @entity173 after i criticised @entity174 last week for wearing a bikini on tv before the watershed , i received a poo ( human ? dog ? badger ? ) in the post ; you have to laugh because i had to sign for it			1
the world is being ruled by the loudest , not the smartest			0
and for the record , the cafe in @entity5 is a delight			1
after i complained about the service at @entity169 ( i did n’t name my personal banking manager , mainly because his name is too long – 18 characters – and heinously difficult to spell , but also because i did n’t want to get him fired ) , and said i was leaving the bank after nearly 40 years , i got a letter from him , with a laminated photograph			0
a photograph ! and yet @entity169 wrote to me to say they will no longer be writing to tell me if something has bounced			0
i used to love @entity173 fizzy water because it does n’t give you a cold shower when you unscrew it , and it ’s not salty			0
now , though , the bottle says : ‘ continue the story on @entity209			0
’ @entity210 ! six hundred years of sophistication dead in the water .			0

@entity0 visits @entity4 in @entity5 , the ' rudest cafe in the @entity8 '
she found the cafe , which has be *slated* on @entity22 to be a ' delight '
