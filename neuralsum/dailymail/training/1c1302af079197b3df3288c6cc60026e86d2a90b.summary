now , one company has made a @entity5 printed toothbrush tailored to an individual 's teeth that promises a thorough clean in just six seconds			1
the @entity8 does n't look like a conventional toothbrush - in fact , it resembles a mouth guard			0
instead of brushing , the device is placed on the surface of the teeth and the user bites on the device			0
it is placed on the surface of a person 's teeth and allows the user to bite on the device and grind their teeth to clean them			1
some of the 400 bristles are visible they then grind their teeth to clean them , instead of using a motion associated with conventional brushes			0
the company uses a 3d model of an individual 's teeth created using an impression or scan made by a dentist to print the device , which costs around £ 122			1
the device itself is made of plastic and contains 400 soft bristles as well as slits for dental floss			1
the bristles are soft and tapered as well as being tailored to teeth to brush along the gumline at a 45 degree angle so that users brush their teeth by biting and grinding for around six seconds			1
by biting the brush using what dentists call the ' modified bass ' technique , users clean the gingival sulcus - the space underneath the gum line - particularly well as well as ' cleaning all other surfaces perfectly , ' according to the company			2
the unusual brush has 400 bristles set at a 45 degree angle to clean below the gum line - and every tooth surface - when a user grinds their teeth and bites on the device in quick succession			2
the handle of the brush is a floss dispenser and there are small slots so floss so that the device cleans in - between teeth too to clean teeth throughly , a user must bite and release the device quickly 10 to 15 times , which creates a ' vibrating , jiggling upwards , downwards and slightly circling movements ' , according to the firm			0
the resulting ' sub gingival bass technique ' is easy to achieve using the tailor - made device but is difficult to master using a conventional handheld brush			2
users of the @entity8 should also grind their teeth with their mouths closed to brush according to the ' fones ' technique to clean the top surface of their molars , the company said			1
to clean teeth throughly , a user must bite and release the device quickly 10 to 15 times , which creates a ' vibrating , jiggling upwards , downwards and slightly circling movements '			0
it also has a little brush in the centre ( pictured in the circle ) to clean a user 's tongue the website says : ' because you are brushing all your teeth at the same time , you are brushing extremely quickly			0
you brush all the difficult - to - reach and inter-dental regions without even having to think about it			0
' there are slits for dental floss that users can route through the innovative brush so they are ' perfectly positioned for an individual 's inter-dental regions ' so that when they bite and grind , they are flossing at the same time			1
the handle of the brush also doubles as a floss dispenser , while there is also an in - built tongue cleaner , that scrapes bacteria off the tongue while the brush is in use			0
the company claims that six seconds of brushing time with the @entity8 is equivalent to a three minute clean with a conventional toothbrush , which relies on a user 's brushing technique the company claims that six seconds of brushing time with the @entity8 is equivalent to a three minute clean with a conventional toothbrush , which relies on a user 's brushing technique			1
while the device is expensive , at around £ 122 , compared to manual toothbrushes , it has 400 bristles , which is roughly 10 times as many as an ordinary toothbrush , leading the company to claim it lasts 10 times longer - or roughly one year			2
