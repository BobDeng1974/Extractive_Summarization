@entity0 said there were ' serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process ' work on a pair of @entity7 commercial spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the @entity9 will be delayed after a losing contender protested the @entity12 awards			1
@entity0 , which lost out with its plans , said there were ' serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process '			1
it has now launched a legal complaint - which @entity12 admits will delay the entire project			0
@entity12 revealed today it is one of two craft selected to begin shuttling astronauts to the @entity9 in 2017			2
the @entity30 will at first be used to take astronauts to the @entity9 , pictured			0
however , @entity32 also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as @entity37 's inflatable habitats , which will be launched in the future @entity0 is constructing what some regard as the true successor to the @entity43			1
known as the @entity53 ( test vehicle pictured below ) , this ‘ mini-shuttle ’ of sorts will launch upright on top of a rocket , taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding back to @entity48 at the end of its mission			2
the @entity7 space agency awarded contracts worth up to $ 6.8 billion to @entity32 and privately owned @entity59 , or @entity59 , to finish designs , build , test and ultimately fly crews to the station , a $ 100 billion research laboratory that orbits about 260 miles ( 418 km ) above @entity48			1
the awards , announced on sept. 16 , culminate a four - year program to restore @entity7 - based human spaceflight services following the retirement of the space shuttles in @entity70 then , @entity12 has been dependent on @entity71 to fly station crewmembers , a service that currently costs the @entity7 about $ 70 million per seat			0
in addition to @entity32 and @entity59 , privately owned @entity0 bid to continue development of its @entity53 spaceplane under @entity12 ’s so - called “ commercial crew ” program			1
the contracts include up to six operational missions			2
@entity32 ’s award is for $ 4.2 billion			1
@entity59 offered to do the work for $ 2.6 billion			1
on friday , @entity84 - based @entity0 formally protested the awards , saying its proposal would cost $ 900 million less than @entity32 ’s			1
' @entity12 ’s own @entity87 and debrief indicate that there are serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process			1
@entity0 , therefore , feels that there is no alternative but to institute a legal challenge , ' the company said in a statement			1
@entity53 the protest , filed with the @entity100 , will temporarily keep @entity12 from moving forward with the next phase of its commercial crew program , @entity12 's @entity98 told @entity103			2
@entity12 has 30 days to respond to @entity0 ’s challenge			1
@entity100 is expected to issue its ruling by jan. 5 , 2015			0
@entity98 was in @entity106 for the opening of the week - long @entity108			0
the long awaited $ 6.8bn deal to replace the @entity43 and end reliance on @entity71 's soyuz craft was revealed at the @entity112 , where launches will take place from 2017			1
@entity32 's design would be launched into space using the @entity118 rocket built by the @entity119 , a venture of @entity32 and @entity121 it will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations that rocket uses a @entity71 - built @entity127 engine , which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with @entity71			1
' from day one , the @entity131 made clear that the greatest nation on @entity48 should not be dependent on other nations to get into space , ' @entity12 administrator @entity130 said at the agency 's @entity112 in @entity136			2
' thanks to the leadership of president @entity139 , the hard work of our @entity12 and industry teams , and support from @entity108 , today we are one step closer to launching our astronauts from @entity7 soil on @entity7 spacecraft and ending the nation ’s sole reliance on @entity71 by 2017			1
' turning over low - @entity48 orbit transportation to private industry will also allow @entity12 to focus on an even more ambitious mission – sending humans to @entity155			0
' the two @entity157 ( @entity158 ) contracts are designed to complete the @entity12 certification for human space transportation systems capable of carrying people into orbit			2
once certification is complete , @entity12 plans to use these systems to ferry astronauts to the @entity9 and return them safely to @entity48			0
' today we do n't know who will be the first commander - but we know is will be a major achievement for our nation , ' said @entity171			0
under the deal , @entity32 will be given $ 4.2bn and spacex $ 2.6bn			1
@entity12 hopes it will spur private development in space			0
' ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that 's the vision of a commercial space industry , ' said @entity171			2
the contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one @entity12 astronaut aboard to verify the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system can launch , maneuver in orbit , and dock to the space station , as well as validate all its systems perform as expected			1
once each company ’s test program has been completed successfully and its system achieves @entity12 certification , each contractor will conduct at least two , and as many as six , crewed missions to the space station			0
these spacecraft also will serve as a lifeboat for astronauts aboard the station			2
" we are excited to see our industry partners close in on operational flights to the @entity9 , an extraordinary feat industry and the @entity12 family began just four years ago , " said @entity203 , manager of @entity12 's @entity204			0
" this space agency has long been a technology innovator , and now we also can say we are an @entity7 business innovator , spurring job creation and opening up new markets to the private sector			0
' the agency and our partners have many important steps to finish , but we have shown we can do the tough work required and excel in ways few would dare to hope			0
' the companies will own and operate the crew transportation systems and be able to sell human space transportation services to other customers in addition to @entity12 , thereby reducing the costs for all customers			0
the craft will replace the @entity43 following its retirement			0
the final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of @entity232 on july 21 , 2011 , bringing about the end of the 30 - year @entity234			0
earlier this year @entity32 took a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle			1
the aerospace giant completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the @entity9			0
the multibillion - dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months , given escalating tensions with @entity71 over its annexation of the @entity248 region of @entity249			0
@entity250 , vice president and program manager for @entity32 's commercial space exploration programs , said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design , but got ' excellent ' feedback from @entity12 during the review last month			1
@entity32 's @entity259 will take crews of seven people to the iss and other destinations from 2017 , it was revealed today			1
' from a technical standpoint , the review went very well , ' he said			0
' to the best of my knowledge we ’re the only @entity272 competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance , ' he said			0
@entity250 said , measured in mass , the @entity32 design for the cargo module was 96 - percent complete at the time of the review , while its design for the crew module was 85 - percent complete , two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design			2
he said the critical design review marked a major step for the @entity32 program			2
' you 've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you 're going to be able to meet those requirements , ' he said			0
@entity32 remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017 , @entity250 said			1
@entity32 's design would be launched into space using the @entity118 rocket built by the @entity119 , a venture of @entity32 and @entity121 that rocket uses a @entity71 - built @entity127 engine , which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with @entity71			1
he said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles , if necessary , although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher			2
since the @entity43 was retired in july 2011 , the @entity7 has relied on @entity71 to get its astronauts into orbit			0
but through their @entity204 , @entity12 has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft			0
next generation : @entity59 says the shuttle will provide a less expensive way to connect to the @entity324 @entity32 has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new crew @entity327 ( @entity259 - 100 ) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years			1
the capsule is funded by @entity12 as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft @entity32 ’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the @entity340 ( @entity341 )			1
they unveiled the new commercial interior of its @entity341 next - generation manned space capsule , showing how people other than @entity12 astronauts may one day travel to space			2
this is the first time they have made the design of the interior public			0
@entity32 and partner @entity37 highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for @entity12 , while @entity37 showcased a full - scale model of its @entity358 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in			2
' we are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential customers - beyond @entity12 - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior , ' said @entity365 , former @entity232 commander and current @entity32 director of crew and mission operations for the @entity204			1
engineers from across @entity32 leveraged the company 's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule 's interior			1
the capsule , interior view of a prototype pictured , will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit			0
it is in direct competition with @entity59 's manned dragon capsule and @entity0 's @entity53 space plane , all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space ' @entity32 's teams have been designing award - winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation , ' said @entity396 , regional director of sales and @entity397 for @entity398			1
' designing the next - generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression			0
