it was once the symbol of @entity2 's strength over the west , a brutal image of power and victory			1
now it stands ruined with the @entity9 's illusion of power over the country shattered , like the windows in his once regal compound			0
built in 1986 , after the @entity16 air strikes in @entity17 , the iconic statue shows a fist crushing an @entity16 aircraft and was the majestic backdrop for many of the dictator 's speeches			1
in a final gesture of contempt rebels forces climbed and painted the statue screaming victory as their dictator remains absent , presumably in hiding			2
@entity49 men with @entity51 special forces were said to be carrying out reconnaissance for @entity53 and rebels around the @entity2 stronghold for what @entity17 officials say could be the ‘ last great battle ’ of the war			1
reports have claimed that the dictator and some of his sons are in the town together with thousands of his troops and clan fighters whose loyalty @entity2 bought when he created @entity45 as effectively his second capital			1
fresh battles rage : a @entity17 man runs across the street seeking shelter from sniper fire in @entity33 today a rebel fighter shoots during an intense gun battle in @entity76 , yesterday			1
today they were still facing pockets of resistance for the second day running , @entity41 @entity80 attacked targets in and around the coastal town , 250 miles east of @entity33 , as @entity53 once again ‘ softened ’ regime defences before a rebel offensive			2
the @entity85 took off from @entity86 in @entity87 on a long - range strike mission firing a salvo of @entity91 precision - guided missiles against a large command and control bunker			0
it followed strikes by @entity85 the previous day on three mobile missile launchers for @entity97 missiles			0
regime commanders are said to have kept back an arsenal of 240 scuds which would be capable of carrying chemical weapons such as mustard gas			0
rebels point to reports that more than 100 of their captured fighters and supporters have been executed in @entity45 and this has fuelled their determination to storm it			2
warning : graphic content below @entity110 : a rebel points his rifle at a man accused of being a mercenary fighting for @entity2 , outside a fire station in the capital a @entity17 worker loads smoke - damaged mannequins from a burnt out clothes shop , into a truck after the intense battle in @entity76 district @entity123 , who is responsible for finance and oil in the @entity17 rebels ' @entity126 , speaks out at a press conference despite continued fighting in @entity33 – @entity85 and @entity130 again attacked targets to the south of the city and regime fighters launched a counter attack near the main airport – @entity45 was poised to become the new front line with thousands of rebel fighters , tanks , artillery and rocket launchers moving to holding positions near the town of @entity144			1
the importance of that military operation was illustrated by @entity53 carrying out 29 strikes on mobile missile launchers around the town as rebels blitzed advancing forces with volleys of @entity154 missiles			2
with @entity53 effectively ‘ closing the ring ’ around @entity45 ’s 100,000 population , defence secretary @entity155 said : ‘ we have information that there are some elements of the regime in @entity45			0
where they are still continuing to wage war on the people of @entity17 , we will continue to degrade their military capabilities			0
‘ the regime needs to recognise that the game is up			0
it is all over and they need to stop attacking their own people … but as long as they do continue to attack the people , @entity53 will continue to attack			0
’ yesterday rebel forces appeared to have been stalled by strong resistance some 60 miles from @entity45 while the defences of the town are finalised under the direction of one of @entity2 ’s sons			1
the rebel leadership , apparently trying to avoid repeating the bloodshed of the battle for @entity33 , are working behind the scenes to secure the peaceful surrender of @entity45 but are said to believe this is a ‘ distant hope ’			1
virtually untouched until recently by the civil war , @entity45 is of both symbolic and strategic importance – it stands on the main highway between @entity33 and the rebel headquarters of @entity187 – and is @entity2 ’s strongest remaining garrison town			1
@entity2 ploughed huge sums of money into @entity45 , arming the local tribes and effectively buying their loyalty months ago			2
rebel fighters would face a difficult task to take it without massive help from @entity53 airstrikes			0
@entity2 has closely cultivated @entity45 and its tribal leaders			2
after @entity33 , it was his showpiece , where he would pitch one of his @entity201 tents and entertain foreign dignitaries			0
@entity203 claimed yesterday it had uncovered evidence that forces loyal to @entity2 massacred detainees at two military camps in @entity33 this week as rebels seized control of the city			1
detainees from a military camp in @entity213 described how , on tuesday evening , 160 of them fled a metal hangar after two guards told them the gates were unlocked			0
as they barged through the gates , two other guards opened fire and threw hand grenades			0
only two dozen managed to escape			0
the second wave of killings is said to have happened on wednesday at the @entity225 military camp , when guards shot five @entity227 the search for the absent dictator continued , @entity231 tornado jets pounded bunkers in @entity45 overnight			1
