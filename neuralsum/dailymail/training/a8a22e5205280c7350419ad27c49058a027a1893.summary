by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:56 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 02:53 est , 28 september 2012 @entity2 today admitted he need to swot up on his history homework after being caught out on @entity5 television			1
the prime minister – in @entity7 for a @entity9 meeting – was tripped up by a general knowledge quiz on on @entity12 ’s @entity11 last night			1
after getting the composer of @entity14 wrong and being unable to translate @entity15 , mr @entity2 confessed : ' i ’m a history obsessive , so i ’m sorry i did n’t do better			1
' scroll down to watch making a point : after an apparently warm welcome , @entity2 is grilled by @entity5 chat show king @entity12 on @entity21 history , which left him squirming in his seat whoops : mr @entity2 was asked who composed @entity14 , to which he wrongly replied @entity26 asked today how he rated his performance on the @entity12 show , mr @entity2 added : ' i think , when i get home and do my children ’s homework , maybe i need to sit down and do a little bit extra myself			1
' it had all started so well			0
the house band played @entity14 as he walked on stage and dry ice was pumped into the studio to replicate a @entity41 fog			1
but the apparently warm welcome quickly turned into a trap as mr @entity12 , famed for his acerbic wit , tested mr @entity2 with questions on @entity21 history			1
asked who composed @entity14 , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ you are testing me there			1
@entity26 , i will go for			1
’ in fact , as mr @entity12 later gleefully revealed , the music was written by @entity52 to a poem by @entity54			1
the prime minister did better on the @entity15 , correctly answering that it was signed in 1215 at @entity57			1
saving face : the prime minister did better on the @entity15 , correctly answering that it was signed in 1215 at @entity57 stumped : despite his @entity62 education , he did n't know the literal translation of the @entity64 @entity15			1
the answer was @entity15 honest : mr @entity2 was also asked whether he was popular in the @entity21 , replying : ' not very popular , no. we have got this budget deficit ' who wrote @entity14 ? @entity2 ’s answer : @entity70 : music was written by @entity52 to a poem by @entity74 many people live in the @entity21 ? @entity2 ’s answer : @entity76 : 62.6million according to the @entity77 last @entity78 was the @entity15 signed ? @entity2 ’s answer : @entity81 : @entity79 was it signed ? @entity2 ’s answer : @entity82 : @entity57 , @entity83 is it now ? @entity2 ’s answer : there is a copy of it in the houses of @entity88 : there are several @entity90 is the literal translation of @entity15 ? @entity2 ’s answer : do n’t knowright answer : great charter but , despite his @entity62 education , he was stumped when asked for a literal translation of the @entity64 – @entity15			1
‘ it would be good if you knew this , ’ mr @entity12 said			1
‘ yes , it would , ’ the prime minister replied			2
‘ you ’ve found me out			0
i ’ve ended my career on your show tonight ! ’ the gentle mickey - taking continued with a series of questions about the @entity21 empire and the difference between @entity108 and @entity109			2
he correctly identified the population of @entity21 and the countries that make up the @entity21			0
mr @entity2 was also asked whether he was popular in the @entity21 , replying : ‘ not very popular , no. we have got this budget deficit – we have to make difficult decisions and that makes you unpopular			1
’ and he was quizzed about @entity118 , the @entity120 cat , who he admitted was a ‘ terrible mouser ’			0
but despite the ribbing , mr @entity2 will have been pleased to have got over at least part of his message about the success of the @entity126 and the attractiveness of the @entity21 economy			1
he also underlined the fact that @entity21 is not in the troubled eurozone			0
straphanger : mr @entity2 braved the @entity7 subway on his way to addresses the @entity9 general in the @entity135 : mr @entity2 walks through the streets of @entity137 after addressing the @entity138 he said the economic outlook would ‘ probably be worse ’ if we were in the euro , adding : ‘ in @entity142 if you are going to have a single currency you are going to end up with some form of single government – i do n’t want that for @entity21			1
’ in appearing on the show , mr @entity2 was following in the footsteps of @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			2
the @entity153 was given top billing at the @entity155 in @entity7 , sharing the bill with @entity21 folk rock band @entity157			2
packed schedule : earlier in the day , mr @entity2 , addressed the 67th session of the @entity138 aides insisted mr @entity2 had done only light preparation for the interview			2
@entity164 answers were prepared on issues like the @entity126 , his relationship with the @entity167 and his views on the @entity5 presidential race			0
sources said the pm had been braced for the fact that @entity12 would crack jokes at his expense , but felt it was worth it if the interview would give him the chance to broadcast a positive message about the @entity21 economy			1
a government source said : ‘ @entity21 has had an extraordinary year			0
we have got something good to shout about			0
so getting out there talking up @entity21 is important			0
we should never forget that we are the biggest investor in @entity5 , @entity5 is the biggest investor in us			0
‘ there is a saying in business that when you want to do better , you go back to your biggest customers and try and squeeze out a bit more			0
’ ' @entity190 ’ by @entity2 by @entity191 the prime minister yesterday turned his hand to giving a history lesson			1
but he proved it is not his best subject			0
despite his @entity62 - education , he stumbled on the answers to ‘ dumb @entity5 questions ’ on @entity21 history			1
he perhaps should have guessed after he entered @entity12 's @entity11 to the strains of @entity14 , that the first topic of conversation might be the @entity204			1
asked about the countries which make up the @entity204 , the prime minister responded : ‘ it is not an empire it is the @entity21			0
the @entity21 of @entity109 , @entity210 , @entity108 … ’ then , like a school teacher in a classroom being quizzed by youngsters , mr @entity2 continued to describe the @entity21 in a simplistic form , using a variety of hand gestures as an aid to his explanations			2
question : what is the deal on @entity108 ? @entity2 : ‘ it is part of the @entity21			2
it is a small country but a very proud people			0
’ question : ‘ how are the @entity108 different from the @entity109 ? ’ @entity2 : ‘ well there are people in wales who speak a different language , who speak welsh as their first language but they are very much part of the @entity21			2
’ question : what is the difference between @entity236 and @entity237 ? @entity2 : ‘ there was a time when all of @entity236 was part of the @entity21			2
‘ there was then a movement for @entity244 independence and when that happened the north of @entity236 decided it wanted to stay with the @entity21 so we have the @entity21 including @entity210 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity236			0
‘ and the @entity237 is a separate country not in the @entity21 , do n’t make that mistake			0
but we have very good relations between the @entity237 and the @entity21			0
’ question : is the division between @entity236 and @entity237 religious ? @entity2 : ‘ it is very complicated , there is huge amount of history involved in this			1
‘ it is partly based on some religious differences but the majority of people who live in @entity236 , including both @entity260 and @entity261 , want to be , a majority want to be , part of the @entity21			0
‘ so we had a big peace agreement which was all about respecting the rights of people in @entity236 to determine their own future			0
‘ and now relations between the @entity21 and the @entity237 are incredibly good			0
‘ @entity167 visited the @entity237 last year , and it was the first time a member of her family had been there since independence			0
it was a really big moment and the bonds now between the @entity237 and the @entity21 are very very strong			0
question : how many people are there in the @entity21 ? @entity2 : ' about 60million			2
we the 22nd most populace country in the world			0
so we are very proud of the @entity126 where we came third in the medals table , i want to just get that in ' question : when was the @entity15 signed ? @entity2 : ' 1215			1
' question : where was it signed ? @entity2 : ' it was signed in @entity57			2
' question : is that where it is now ? @entity2 : ' no the @entity15 is i believe , there is a copy of it i have seen which is in the @entity297			1
' the big moment of the @entity15 was basically people saying to the king that you know other people have to have rights			2
‘ it was very important that you respect - then it was the rights of noble rather just the rights of people			0
it was the seeds of democracy about people having rights and the crown not being able to ride roughshod over everybody			0
' question : and the literal translation was ? @entity2 : ' again , you are testing me			1

@entity153 walked on stage on @entity12 's @entity11 to @entity14
but when asked who composed it , he wrongly replied @entity26
despite @entity62 education , he also did n't know translation of @entity15
the self - confessed history obsessive said he was ' sorry ' he did n't do better
@entity2 admitted he was ' not very popular ' because of dire economy
