' that year was tense , ' he said			0
' we did have to wait a while and there were times i was n't sure what would happen			0
i had this false sense of optimism but they could have said anything			0
' during the wait , they never imagined the scenes of wednesday december 17 , when the @entity42 and @entity9 agreed to normalize relations			1
' it was a brilliant moment on wednesday , the announcement was a real , real surprise			2
open wounds : the themes explored in @entity15 about sexuality , poverty , the struggle with @entity78 and addictions were still raw in the country success : @entity15 , a modern adaptation of @entity84 's @entity83 , replaces 1800s @entity85 with 1990s @entity86 , and tuberculosis with aids.the original production enjoyed a seven - year run			1

the original production enjoyed a seven - year run			1
excitement : the producers spoke about the emotion of putting this show on for young @entity9 , as the themes and music , they hoped , would connect with the current generation dealing : the musical deals heavily with the issue of @entity115 and @entity78 , while the island nation 's healthcare system developed to fight the disease has been lauded internationally audiences across the @entity42 and @entity120 embraced the struggling film maker , the nightclub dancer , the drag queen ; the bisexuality , the drugs , the fight against @entity78			1
despite the cultural references - which may fly over the heads of 95 per cent of @entity9 who do n't have internet - @entity51 insists this is the perfect musical to break the ice			1
and the directors of @entity25 's @entity133 , chosen for its intimate setting , had no objections			0
