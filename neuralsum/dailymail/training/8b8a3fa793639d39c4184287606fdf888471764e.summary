by @entity0 the former prime minister said it @entity2 must not win any votes by taking a tougher line on immigration and @entity7			2
he said changing course now would only ' confuse ' voters @entity10 was criticised last night for complaining about voters who elected @entity12 opposed to rampant immigration – despite running an ‘ open door ’ policy on migrants while in office			1
the former prime minister said it was wrong that the debate on the @entity20 was dominated by ‘ anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get @entity23 out of @entity7 ’			1
these , he added , were ‘ not answers to what is happening in the world ’			1
but critics pointed out that it was mr @entity10 ’s policies which caused the problems in the first place by allowing immigration to run rife over the last decade , creating the largest population explosion since @entity36 times			1
in his comments , made to a @entity39 television station , mr @entity10 said : ‘ of course we should be worried when a party like @entity42 comes first in the @entity7 election , it would be foolish not to be			1
‘ but on the other hand we also have to stand for what is correct and right for the future of @entity23 in the 21st century			2
‘ when the world is changing so fast , to end up having the debate dominated by anti-immigrant feeling and a desire to get @entity23 out of @entity7 , these are not solutions for the 21st century			1
’ but @entity53 , the @entity54 mp for @entity55 , said mr @entity10 was a member of a ‘ supranational , smug , anti-democratic elite ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity10 was in charge of this country when the floodgates were opened			1
