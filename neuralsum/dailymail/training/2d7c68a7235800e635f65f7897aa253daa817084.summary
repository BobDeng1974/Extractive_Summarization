age - related macular degeneration affects 600,000 in @entity2 a revolutionary eye implant inspired by the @entity4 could help more than half a million people suffering from a previously incurable condition that leads to blindness			1
the device – a mini telescope comprised of two lenses – treats age - related macular degeneration ( @entity1 ) , which affects 600,000 in @entity2 , mainly the elderly			1
the disease targets a part of the retina called the macula , the 5mm spot at the back of the eye packed with light - receptive cells			2
it often becomes diseased with age , leading to central vision becoming distorted and blurred			2
there is no cure and about half of patients are so badly affected they are registered blind			0
however , a @entity29 eye surgeon and an optical physicist have come up with a new solution – inspired by a famous flaw with the @entity4 probe			1
eye surgeon @entity34 said : ‘ there have been telescopic implants for @entity1 for a couple of years , but getting the optics right has been extremely problematic			1
‘ the lenses are so strong that focusing images has been difficult , and the results for patients have been hit and miss. ’ the scientists then remembered the problems surrounding the @entity4 telescope			2
‘ after @entity4 was put into orbit in 1990 the images that came back were fuzzy , ’ mr @entity34 said			2
scientists eventually solved the problem : the edges of the 8ft - wide mirror were two - thousandths of a millimetre too flat			0
the solution – called ‘ adaptive optics ’ – was to add extra mirrors to compensate for the flaw			0
using this technique , mr @entity34 , of the @entity60 , and professor @entity61 , of @entity62 , in @entity63 , have designed a ‘ mini telescope ’ to be inserted surgically into the eye			1
called the @entity67 , it is comprised of two lenses 2mm apart , and magnifies images , as well as directing the centre of the image away from diseased parts of the macula and on to healthy sections			0
combined , these effects enable the patient to see clearly again			0
@entity29 eye surgeon @entity34 and optical physicist professor @entity61 were inspired by the @entity4 ( above ) the new lenses come with a hefty price tag – £ 6,000 per eye – but mr @entity34 believes the cost could fall to £ 500 , at which point the @entity83 may start to fund it			1
he said : ‘ i would like to see it on the @entity83 by 2017 , because it will transform the treatment of people with end - stage @entity1			0
’ he added the lenses were not a cure , as they did not stop the macula from deteriorating .			0
