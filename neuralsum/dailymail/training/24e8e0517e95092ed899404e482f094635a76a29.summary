' ms @entity0 admits while it is tough to get motivated sometimes it 's all about getting into a routine she also said the only way to get lean and build muscle is to lift weights regularly some of her top tips for keeping fit include drinking lemon in warm water every morning throughout her 12 training sessions a week ms @entity0 makes sure each session focuses on a different part of the body			2
