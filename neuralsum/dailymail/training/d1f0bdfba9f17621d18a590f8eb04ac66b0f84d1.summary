some statistics can be misleading , such as the one that says @entity3 have lost only once in their last 17 matches			1
to the casual football watcher , it ’s a run of results that should hint at progress			2
so , too , should their position in the @entity11			1
@entity3 are fourth , only five points behind champions @entity13			1
but things are not always as they seem and anybody who has paid any attention to @entity3 ’s play this season will know that any progress under @entity20 has been hewn from organisation and sheer stubbornness rather than the progressive , fluent football for which the club have always claimed to be known			1
@entity3 captain @entity25 cut a frustrated figure during sunday 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity28 @entity3 goalkeeper @entity29 ( right ) shouting in anger after @entity28 took the lead at @entity32 @entity20 watches on as the @entity33 struggled to a late point against @entity28 on sunday afternoon @entity35 to read the stats that shame @entity20 's stuttering @entity3 last friday — two days before the ill - deserved point taken from a game at @entity28 on sunday - @entity39 poignantly referenced the spirit of @entity41			1
‘ we look for flair and pace and passion to play the game the @entity3 way , ’ said @entity39 , borrowing a line from a poem written to commemorate the 1958 disaster			1
suffice to say that after another stilted @entity3 performance at @entity32 , that search goes on			1
@entity53 rescued @entity3 with a strike deep into injury - time on sunday @entity25 and defender @entity55 trudge off the @entity32 field after @entity39 's side salvaged a late leveller you have to wonder what former winger @entity60 , now assistant manager , makes of the change at @entity3 one qualified observer described sunday ’s @entity3 display as ‘ joyless ’			1
more worrying for @entity39 , though , is the fact that the coterie of ex-players and @entity3 legends still close to matters at @entity71 are beginning to whisper their concerns , too			2
this is one of the things about @entity3			2
it is similar to @entity76 in that once you have played there you never quite let go			0
once a red , always a red			0
as such , those with their ear to the ground are worth listening to and the consensus is that @entity39 ’s team simply can not continue to play like this if they wish to be afforded the patience and understanding the coach has admitted the team still need			0
‘ they are just so boring to watch , ’ said one former player last week			1
that is a generalisation but occasionally it is hard to disagree			0
@entity3 striker @entity95 is crowded out as the @entity97 attempts to move forward with the ball @entity28 midfielder @entity99 celebrating on the line after the @entity28 took the lead on 49 minutes @entity28 players congratulating goalscorer @entity103 ( centre ) after the midfielder found the net the saving graces for @entity3 right now are clear but their hold on them is not			1
the fact @entity3 are in the @entity110 places and ahead of @entity76 is important			2
they are fortunate to be fourth with the points tally that they have but , nevertheless , they do remain on course for achieving the principal objective given @entity39 when he joined the club in the summer			0
whether they continue to play this way and remain in the top four remains to be seen			0
comparisons have already been made with @entity39 ’s predecessor @entity120 but the up - to - date numbers are worth revealing - and they do not reflect well on this @entity3 team			1
after 24 league games of a season that was ended by his dismissal last april , @entity120 had taken four points fewer than @entity39			0
he had , however , won the same number of games – 12 - and his team had managed more shots on goal , on and off target , and forced more corners			0
this points to flaws in @entity39 ’s use of his players			0
@entity120 ’s team were hardly heralded as one welded fast to @entity3 ’s best traditions yet it would appear that they spent more time threatening the opposition goal than the team we are watching this time round			2
on social media on sunday @entity39 ’s @entity3 were being criticised heavily by their own supporters			2
chief among the concerns were the manager ’s continued belief in a three - man defence - though that seems to be wavering - his use of captain @entity25 in midfield , the refusal to use @entity157 at all and the relatively lethargic recent performances of record signing @entity161			0
@entity3 skipper @entity25 , playing in a midfield role , is challenged by @entity99 as @entity163 watches on close by @entity164 , pictured reacting next to @entity165 , struggled to ignite his team 's play all of these would appear to be part of the problem			1
@entity3 have no real pace , so do not counter-attack consistently well , something that has always been part of the dna at @entity71			2
equally , @entity3 do not keep possession for long spells in the right areas , and so fail to build pressure as well as they might			2
‘ it ’s not a question of playing with wingers or without or with three defenders or four defenders , it ’s about the playing style , ’ said @entity39 on friday			0
‘ certainly , at the moment we could have done better in terms of ball possession			0
’ striker @entity187 ( centre ) struggled to impress up front for @entity3 against @entity28 summer signing @entity161 ( left ) also struggled to make an impact in the @entity3 midfield criticism of @entity3 ’s use of @entity195 as a target man for long passes late on sunday seems unfair			1
it worked , and was also a tactic @entity39 used successfully to turn round @entity201 ’s @entity200 last - 16 game against @entity202 in @entity203 last summer			0
comparisons with his @entity97 team are interesting , though			0
they were a pragmatic bunch , too			0
after the exhilaration of an opening victory against @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity201 ’s football was short on flair but that squad did not have the attacking talent that this @entity3 side possess and it is tempting to wonder what @entity60 makes of it all			1
under @entity120 , he grew exasperated at what he saw as a refusal to play on the front foot			0
@entity120 ’s perceived failure to use wide players well also frustrated the most famous winger @entity71 has ever seen , yet @entity60 is now assistant to a man who in certain areas again views the game differently			0
one of @entity60 ’s prime roles is to talk @entity3 ’s players - and @entity39 - through the strengths and weaknesses of the next opposition			1
on tuesday the opponents are @entity235 and during his preparation , @entity39 ’s assistant will have noticed one thing : @entity235 are the only @entity11 side to have played more long passes than @entity3 this season			1
@entity3 winger @entity241 takes on defender @entity242 during a rare start this season @entity3 left back @entity244 receives his marching orders from referee @entity246 late on			2

@entity3 rescued a 1 - 1 draw against @entity28 at @entity32
@entity20 has @entity3 in the @entity11 top four
however , they are not playing the fluent football they are known for
one former player claimed @entity3 are ' just so boring to watch '
