his older brother , @entity55 , 20 , then stood up and joined in the attack which took mr @entity6 's ambulance off the road for four hours			1
ms @entity24 intervened and was able to get the victim to their vehicle before phoning police			1
both brothers had fled the scene by the time officers arrived , but were later arrested			0
when questioned , @entity20 accepted the paramedic was only trying to carry out his job , admitting his actions were uncalled for			0
the teenager said he wanted to apologise to the victim			0
his brother claimed he punched mr @entity6 after he had started to push him and he did n’t like it			1
mr @entity46 said : ' the ambulance was out of commission for four hours , presenting a risk to the general public			1
' the court heard how mr @entity6 was anxious , had trouble sleeping and was hesitant in attending certain jobs for some time after the incident , before both brothers admitted assault causing actual bodily harm			0

you will be brought before the courts and punished			0
' @entity157 acting director of operations , @entity159 , added : ' the violent and physical attack on our member of staff was absolutely unacceptable , and i fully welcome the custodial sentence given			1
' the assaulted paramedic himself needed hospital treatment and , as a consequence , we had to allocate another emergency ambulance to treat the patient at the scene , when this resource could have been allocated to another emergency call			2
' when paramedics attend the scene of any incident , they are there to provide professional medical attention to the patient , and should never be put in a position where they are subjected to any violence or aggression			0
' we hope this sentence sends out a very clear message to anyone who assaults our crews - either verbally or physically - that they not only face the possibility of prosecution , but a prison sentence as well			2

his older brother , also involved in the attack , received a lighter sentence
