by @entity0 published : 22:38 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 22:38 est , 29 september 2013 the inhabitants of @entity2 lived off local rats , according to scientists who analysed the teeth of 41 skeletons			1
the island , also called @entity2 , first settled around a.d. 1200 , is famous for its more than 1,000 ' walking ' @entity8 , most of which originally faced inland			2
researchers compared the teeth that had been excavated previously to animal bones unearthed on the island			1
inhabitants on the remote @entity2 - famous for its @entity8 ( pictured ) - lived on rats by looking at the nitrogen and carbon isotopes of each , they round that @entity21 rats , also known as kiore , was one of the main sources of protein in the first few centuries of the island 's history			1
the rat is somewhat smaller than @entity30 rats and , according to ethnographic accounts , tasty to eat			2
located in the @entity32 , @entity2 is the most isolated inhabited landmass on @entity34 and the closest inhabitants are located on the @entity36 about 1,200 miles to the west			2
the researchers were also able to radiocarbon date 26 of the teeth remains , allowing them to plot how the diet on the island changed over time			1
radiocarbon dating works by measuring the decay of carbon - 14 , allowing a date range to be assigned to each individual			0
report co-author @entity49 , from @entity48 , told @entity50 that rats should not be underestimated in their value as a food resource			0
researchers said catching a rat to eat may have been easier - and tastier - than catching a fish he said for the people who lived on @entity2 , ' it was probably easier to go get a rat than it was to go get a fish			1
' the polynesian rat commonly travels with humans on ocean voyages and , like any other rat , multiplies rapidly when it arrives on a new island			0
in some cases , the rats were probably transported intentionally to be used as food , something supported by ethnographic accounts stating that , in some areas of @entity74 , rats were being consumed at the time of @entity30 contact			0
additionally , previous research has suggested the rats were at least partly responsible for the deforestation of @entity2			0
the research , which was published in the @entity80 , also found that islanders rarely ate seafood but added to their diet with chickens and c3 plants , such as sweet potatoes , bananas and yams			0
scientists compared teeth from 41 skeletons excavated from the island with animal bones found there @entity95 , of the @entity96 at @entity48 , told @entity50 : ' traditionally , from @entity21 cultures you have a heavy predominance of using marine products , especially in the early phase of colonization			1
' she said one reason people did not eat seafood is that the north of the island contains steep cliffs and would have been difficult to fish from			1
its southerly latitude may make it cooler and affect fishing , she said			0
' because of their geographic location and climate conditions , there just were n't as many marine products for them to get , ' @entity95 said			0
some of the skeletons studied by the researchers appeared to eat more fish than others			1
the reports suggests that fish eaters may have lived on a part of the island where fishing was easier or that eating fish was a mark of having a ' higher status ' .			2

researchers compared skeleton teeth with animal bones from island
*discovered* many people used @entity21 rats as source of protein
despite living on island , inhabitants rarely appeared to eat fish
