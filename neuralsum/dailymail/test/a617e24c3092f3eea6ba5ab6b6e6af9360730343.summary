@entity2 semi-finalists @entity0 still have lingering relegation worries in the @entity4 after they threw away a 1 - 0 lead to draw 1 - 1 with @entity6 at the @entity7			1
@entity0 took the lead with only four minutes gone when @entity9 got a touch to @entity12 's nod - down to divert the ball past @entity6 goalkeeper @entity14			1
but they allowed a mediocre @entity6 side to snatch a point in the 90th minute when @entity18 rifled in a shot from @entity21 's precise pass			1

goals : @entity18 90 ' referee : @entity61 attendance : 17,953 @entity0 face @entity63 in their last - four clash at @entity66 on april 18			1
on their previous semi-final appearance , in 1927 , they lost 3 - 0 to eventual winners @entity6 at @entity70			1
as @entity0 's cup displays have been impressive , though , their league form has been patchy			2
they had won only two of their previous nine championship matches , losing six of them			0
@entity6 's season has been one of inconsistency , too , but they arrived at the @entity7 on an unbeaten run of three matches			2
they were also undefeated on their travels for five games , winning their past three			0
@entity0 made the early running and were rewarded in only the fourth minute when they went ahead			2
@entity27 crossed from the left , @entity12 nodded it forward and @entity9 guided it past @entity14 for his third goal in two matches			2
@entity6 , beaten 2 - 1 at home by @entity0 in the cup fourth round in january , replied quickly			1
@entity18 tried a snapshot from the edge of the @entity0 area but his effort was half - blocked and goalkeeper @entity23 gathered comfortably			1
@entity0 could have stretched their lead when captain @entity25 rose to meet a @entity12 corner but fellow centre - back @entity26 got there before him and glanced his header wide			2
@entity6 tried hard to get back into the game but had little joy			0
@entity107 cut in from the left flank but his powerful strike was blocked by @entity25 at the near post , and @entity48 's dangerous free - kick was neatly caught by @entity23			0
@entity9 celebrates scoring for @entity0 against @entity6 @entity0 continued to assert control after the break , with @entity114 loanee @entity29 impressing on his debut in midfield			1
most of @entity0 's best creative moves were channelled through him			0
@entity6 relied on the swift counter-attack , with @entity121 almost setting free @entity18			1
but his final pass carried too much pace and , with @entity18 unable to retrieve it , the chance went begging			0
an opportunity also went astray at the other end , when @entity129 - @entity44 's poor pass was intercepted by @entity12 but the @entity0 winger hesitated too long before firing a shot wide of @entity14 's far post			0
@entity6 responded with a low shot from @entity47 , which @entity23 did well to save , and a header from @entity136 from another @entity48 free - kick , which drifted wide			0
@entity0 went much closer in the closing stages			0
substitute @entity142 , on debut on loan from @entity141 , forced a fine stop from @entity14 and @entity26 nodded a @entity12 corner into the ground and up against the crossbar			0
but @entity6 grabbed a draw right at the end from @entity53 's fine finish from the edge of the home area .			0

@entity18 scores stoppage time equaliser for @entity6
@entity9 had put @entity0 in front after four minutes
