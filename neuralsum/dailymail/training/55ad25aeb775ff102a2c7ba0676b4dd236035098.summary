they are one of the world 's most fearsome predators , with strong jaws and a muscular build weighing as much as 40 stone			0
but this has not deterred @entity7 from raising a lion as a pet - and the pair have grown so close they have even shared the same bed			2
mr @entity7 has reared 11 - year - old @entity13 since birth and they regularly ride in his truck together			1
@entity13 was born to his mother , @entity18 , in captivity , but was removed from her care after fears the cub 's father would kill him			1
unable to return to the wild because of his tame and friendly nature , @entity13 lives with 18 other lions , as well as cheetahs and leopards , all looked after by mr @entity7			1
eleven years later and the bond between mr @entity7 and the ' @entity50 ' is stronger than ever			2
he spends his time walking @entity13 along dusty tracks in @entity53 - affectionately holding on to his tail - and drives the big cat to and from hunts in the back of his truck			2
to appease @entity13 - who dislikes noise - mr @entity7 makes sure to walk barefoot next to the lion			1
mr @entity7 , who wished to keep his location secret , said : ' since @entity13 , i have raised nineteen lions , and leopards and cheetahs			1
' but he is special because of the bond we share			0
i learnt so much from him			0
' it was a once in a lifetime experience to grow up with him and learn and live with him through all of the stages of being a lion			0
' people talk about lions like they are just lions but they have personalities , they have humour and laugh			0
' @entity13 is a gentle giant			0
he has never attacked humans and i trust him completely			0
' @entity13 lives with 18 other lions , as well as cheetahs and leopards , all looked after by mr @entity7 , 69 the cub needed constant feeding every four hours - here mr @entity7 is seen training and playing with @entity13 as a cub he described @entity13 as a ' gentle giant ' and said ' people talk about lions like they are just lions but they have personalities , they have humour ' unable to return to the wild because of his tame and friendly nature , @entity13 lives with mr @entity7 and they have developed a unique bond			1

@entity26 , 69 , has reared 11 - year - old @entity13 from birth and they have developed a strong bond
@entity13 was born to his mother , @entity18 , in captivity , but was taken from her care after fears cub 's father would kill him
mr @entity7 was left to care for the lion cub and it has even slept in his bed and regularly rides in his truck
however , he has to make sure he walks barefoot next to the lion when taking it out for walks as it dislikes noise
