new role : pope @entity5 prepares to greet cardinals - but it 's his comments that the @entity3 are ' @entity10 soil usurped by the @entity4 ' which have garnered as much attention by the @entity4 government the newly appointed @entity5 stumbled after being introduced to the @entity38 , and his comments on the @entity3 have appeared to have given the bumps to @entity0 ‘ there was a pretty extraordinarily clear referendum in the @entity3 and i think that is a message to everyone in the world that the people of these islands have chosen very clearly the future they want			1
