wealthy foreigners who buy and sell @entity2 property could face a new tax under plans being considered by @entity5			1
the chancellor is looking at putting capital gains tax on the @entity2 homes of foreign owners in his @entity10 next month			1
such a move could help curb the housing bubble in @entity13 and the @entity14 , where demand for homes from @entity18 oligarchs and @entity20 investors has helped spark a price boom			0
homes for the super rich : a property on @entity24 , @entity13 , on the market for £ 200,000,000			0
foreign investors are attracted to properties in @entity13 because they benefit from generous tax breaks it is unclear how much the tax would raise but the @entity31 is thought to have costed the measure			2
@entity2 homeowners have to pay capital gains tax ( @entity35 ) – typically 28 per cent – if they make a profit when they sell a property that is not deemed to be their main residence			1
but foreign investors are exempt from tax on all properties – making @entity13 homes in particular an attractive option			2

estate agents @entity50 believe 70 per cent of new - build properties in prime areas of @entity13 go to foreign buyers			2
