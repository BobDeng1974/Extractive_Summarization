without @entity81 or @entity82 , the third umpire spent a few minutes examining the replay before deciding @entity19 had the finest of edges — only for the ball - tracker graphic to finally appear and show it was completely missing the stumps			2
@entity90 worry @entity90 had an injury scare when he was struck on the right hand while fielding at leg slip and fell to the ground			0
