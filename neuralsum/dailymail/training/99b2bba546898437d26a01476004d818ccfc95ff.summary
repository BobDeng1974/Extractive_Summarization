the competition , which competes with the @entity19 as the curtain - opener for the @entity22 season , has been running since 2009 and this was the first time @entity0 had lifted the trophy			0
unfortunately for @entity1 fans and neutrals alike , the match was essentially over by half time as @entity0 dominated play and entered the break 2 - 0 up			1
@entity7 made one change from the side that played yesterday as @entity49 youngster @entity48 replaced @entity34			0
@entity50 : @entity51 lifts his eighth trophy since joining @entity0 two seasons ago battle : @entity0 's @entity55 vies for the ball with @entity1 's @entity57 embrace : @entity11 celebrates with @entity58 ( left ) and @entity14 after his goal scrap : @entity1 's midfielder @entity61 battles with @entity0 's @entity51 @entity62 ; @entity11 scored twice for the @entity16 champions and wins his first trophy with @entity0 @entity0 : @entity65 , @entity48 , @entity51 , @entity55 ( @entity34 34 ) , @entity66 ( @entity67 37 ) , @entity58 , @entity14 ( @entity68 56 ) , @entity69 , @entity33 , @entity29 ( @entity70 56 ) , @entity11 ( @entity71 55 ) goals : @entity11 ( 4 , 20 ) , @entity14 ( 15 ) @entity1 : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 ( @entity76 31 ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 31 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 44 ) , @entity83 ( @entity84 21 ) , @entity57 ( @entity85 31 ) , @entity86 , @entity61 the @entity3 holders won the @entity88 by 19 points last season and with displays such as today 's , few could argue that @entity7 's men are clear favourites to retain their title			1
many of their players may have returned from the @entity30 slightly jaded , particularly those who returned as @entity98 , but with the addition of @entity11 the @entity99 are a formidable prospect			0
their @entity103 manager spoke of the pressure he felt to bring trophies to a club boasting an extensive collection of world - class players , but if today 's performance was anything to go by , he is unlikely to disappoint			0
pressure : @entity7 has said he feels immense pressure to win everything with @entity0 embrace : @entity7 greets @entity11 at fulltime			2
