by @entity0 he solved one of the greatest mysteries in the universe ... but last night @entity5 was at the centre of one himself			1
professor @entity5 , the scientist who first predicted the existence of the ‘ @entity9 particle ’ , was yesterday awarded the @entity10 , but officials admitted they did not know where he was or if he even knew he had won the award			1
the @entity14 could not raise him on the phone before making the announcement and said he had gone ‘ into hiding ’			2
@entity27 , a friend and fellow physicist , said : ‘ the pressure was so much he decided to go on holiday without a phone to avoid the media storm			0
' he ’s not available and good for him			0
he did n’t tell even me			0
’ in a statement prepared last week , amid anticipation that he would be the 120th @entity37 to be honoured with a @entity38 , prof @entity5 said he was ‘ overwhelmed ’			1

and pictured ( right ) , @entity5 , who has won the @entity10 born in @entity47 in 1929 , the son of a @entity46 sound engineer , @entity5 was a gifted pupil at @entity49 ’s @entity48 where he won many prizes – although none for physics			1
he chose to study at @entity54 , after rejecting @entity55 and @entity56 as the choice of the ‘ idle rich ’ , and gained a first - class honours degree in 1950			0
he was a young lecturer at @entity59 in 1964 when he dreamed up the particle that would make him famous			0
along with two other groups of scientists who were working independently , he came up with an explanation of how the most basic building blocks of the universe gain mass. mr @entity5 shares the prize with @entity68 physicist @entity67 who proposed a similar theory around the same time the theory states that the cosmos is pervaded by an invisible field that confers mass on particles as they pass through it			1
unlike the other scientists of the time , prof @entity5 also forecast the field was made up of countless tiny particles – higgs bosons , or @entity9 particles			1
the theory was not universally accepted and one of his papers was rejected for publication because it was ‘ of no obvious relevance to physics ’			0
but by the 1980s , the hunt for the @entity92 was on in earnest and last year , almost 50 years after @entity93 predicted its existence , scientists at the @entity90 found it			2
prof @entity5 shares the £ 775,000 prize with @entity68 scientist @entity67 , who with colleague @entity96 proposed a similar theory around the same time			1
dr @entity96 died in 2011 and , under @entity10 rules , can not be honoured			0
prime minister @entity99 said : ‘ it took nearly 50 years and thousands of great minds to discover the @entity92 after @entity93 proposed it , and he and all those people should be extremely proud			0
’ professor @entity5 appears to wipe away a tear after scientists at the @entity90 claimed to have discovered a particle believed to be the @entity92 in 2012 dr @entity107 , of @entity108 , said : ‘ nobody can be more deserving of the prize than the visionaries who waited 50 years to discover if their ideas were right or wrong			1
’ professor @entity113 , of the @entity114 , added : ‘ the audacity of proposing such a bizarre and all - pervading mechanism based on what was known half a century ago is simply stunning			2
’ but @entity10 rules state the prize can be shared between only three people			2
@entity120 , of @entity108 , a member of the team that was overlooked , congratulated the winners but questioned why the @entity10 committee was ‘ constrained by a self - imposed rule ’ .			0

professor @entity5 can not be found after winning *prestigious* prize
officials say they do n't know where he is , or if he knows he 's won at all
shares the £ 775,000 prize with @entity68 scientist @entity67
