it could be the ultimate ocean going retreat - with a ' party deck ' hull specially designed to keep your martini safe at all times			0
rather than a sleek yacht , @entity5 is hoping someone will instead prefer an experimental navy vessel built to endure travel through rough seas at high speed			1
the experimental boat can remain stable and travel at high speeds in waves upto twelve feet high - although its triple deck bunk beds do leave it in need of a little interior design			1
the ultimate party deck ? the boat has a large rear desk which remains stable even in 12 foot waves the 105 - ft ( 32 - m ) long , 55 - ft ( 17 - m ) wide , 180 - ton ( 163 - tonne ) watercraft features two 3,480 hp diesel engines , two 180 - kw @entity34 diesel electric generators , and a top speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h , or 35 mph )			1
it is now on sale for $ 180,000 online , and is currently in @entity38			0

it also has a shower - equipped bathroom , plus a washer and dryer			0
the ship has an advanced hull that provides for outstanding stability and speed in high sea states and is capable of 30 - plus knots in wave heights of up to 12 feet			2
' @entity57 , designated as a @entity58 ( @entity58 ) for the exercise , is demonstrating the flexibility achievable by ' modularity ' in a small , fast , highly maneuverable platform , ' the @entity56 wrote when it first trialled the ship			2
the unique design has a large rear desk - perfect for parties buyers may want to redecorate the craft , which comes with three tier bunkbeds and a rather minimalist kitchen area ' the joint high speed vessel ( experimental ) @entity73 ( @entity74 ) has been evaluating the potential of fast , shallow draft , open architecture , multi-mission vessels with large payload fractions in the areas of mine warfare , special operations , ship - to - objective maneuver and medical and non-combatant support operations			1
' some of its weapons tested during @entity88 include the joint @entity5 and @entity89 and the @entity90 and launcher , intended to launch @entity92 ( @entity92 ) - although these have now been removed .			0
