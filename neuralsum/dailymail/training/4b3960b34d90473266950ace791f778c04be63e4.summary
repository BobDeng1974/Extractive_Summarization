on april 29 , 2002 , a crowd of 711 assembled at the @entity1 in @entity2 to watch @entity5 face @entity3			1
after 31 minutes , @entity6 picked up the ball off @entity8 and shuffled it from his left foot to his right before firing into the far corner			2
it was his first goal representing @entity5 and he would score four more on the way towards winning the player of the tournament award			2
@entity6 ( left ) in discussion with @entity17 ( right ) in @entity18 2014 ahead of the @entity19 @entity6 celebrates scoring for @entity5 at the @entity20 against @entity21 in @entity22 @entity6 celebrates scoring for @entity5 against @entity23 at @entity24 with team - mate @entity25 ( right ) @entity6 's love affair with @entity5 had begun and he wanted to share it with his team - mates			1
on the night @entity5 were eliminated the squad convened for a farewell meal			2
after gaining under 17 coach @entity32 's permission , @entity6 stood up and produced a piece of paper from his pocket			1
on it he had written a poem about how much he loved playing for his country			2
@entity6 , along with team - mate @entity42 , recited the poem called @entity43 to a crowd of nearly 30 silent onlookers			1
' i think it took most of the group aback , ' @entity32 said			0
dressing room convention dictates @entity32 is not allowed to reveal the full contents of the poem , but it is safe to say there were no rhyming couplets or iambic pentameters involved			0
but that did not matter			0
' here was a young boy just expressing his love for @entity5 in the best format and most succinct manner he could , ' said @entity32 , who has 37 years coaching experience			1
' i have never seen anyone stand up and do that before			0
' i will never forget it			0
' @entity6 will play his 100th @entity5 game as captain of the national side against @entity68 at @entity69 @entity32 had previously heard good things about a young @entity71 in @entity73 's academy who was running rings around opponents for fun			1
at first sight , there was little to suggest the teenager who reported for duty just before the championships would go on to earn 99 senior caps before his 29th birthday			2
' he did n't stand out , not in terms of the way he dressed or behaved , ' @entity32 says			0
once he had seen @entity6 in action , @entity88 's opinion changed			1
' his attitude was absolutely first - class , ' @entity32 said			0
' he was combative without being over-aggressive and i liked that			0
' he was a genuine boy and a genuine footballer			0
' from then on , @entity6 's career looked set to go in just one direction - up			1
in february 2003 he became the youngest player to earn a senior cap when he came off the bench in the 3 - 1 defeat to @entity102			2
his team - mates spoke about watching a young @entity6 laughing and joking with his international team - mates on the way to the match at @entity108			2
he was not fazed by what lay ahead , as he demonstrated when he impressed on an otherwise shambolic night for @entity111 football			0
@entity112 ( right ) shares a joke with @entity6 during an @entity5 training session in november 2005 ' his first touch was top - class , ' @entity115 said			1
' every time he had the ball at his feet you thought something important could happen			0
' @entity6 became @entity5 's youngest goalscorer in a qualifier against @entity123 and it came as no surprise when @entity115 named him in his @entity24 squad			1
it was equally unsurprising when @entity6 took the tournament by storm , scoring a brace against @entity129 and @entity23			2
@entity6 was front and back page news			2
@entity112 was not exaggerating when he described @entity6 's form as the ' best in @entity133 '			1
@entity115 ramped the hype up too much by comparing the 18 - year - old to @entity136			0
soon after completing his Â£ 30million move to @entity139 , questions were raised about @entity6 's temperament			1
@entity115 had to substitute a raging @entity6 in the first half against @entity142 after he picked up a booking and threatened to earn a second			2
@entity6 argued with @entity145 and several of the @entity147 team during @entity5 's embarrassing defeat in @entity149			1
but @entity6 's @entity5 career has not been without incident , particularly during the 2006 @entity19 that temper was to cost @entity5 at the 2006 @entity19			1
weeks after declaring ' the big man is back ' following his famous metatarsal injury , @entity6 was sent off for stamping on @entity155 , although @entity156 played his part in the dismissal of his @entity139 team - mate , though			0
@entity115 said he was ' 200 per cent ' sure @entity6 would bounce back from the sending - off , but @entity5 did not			1
they fell into a slumber under @entity162 , but @entity6 led the fight back under @entity164			0
with the @entity165 now a fading force , @entity6 was the main man and he thrived under expectation , winning @entity5 's @entity170 award in 2008 and 2009			1
@entity6 could not carry his form into the @entity172 though			0
again going into the tournament suffering from injury , he failed to score and produced an ill - advised flurry of abuse at @entity5 fans following the 0 - 0 draw against @entity179			0
the issue of @entity6 's temperament again came to the fore when he was sent off for flippantly kicking out at @entity183 in a qualifier against @entity185 in october 2011 , which meant he missed @entity5 's first two matches of @entity189			1
@entity6 scored the winner against co-hosts @entity192 on his return but @entity5 went out on penalties for the third time in his international career			1
@entity6 took over as @entity5 captain after @entity112 retired from international duty after the @entity20 @entity6 broke his @entity19 duck in @entity18 last summer , but @entity5 crashed out in the group stages			1
one good thing was to come out of the tournament for @entity6 though			0
his team - mate and close friend @entity112 quit international football and manager @entity17 handed the armband to @entity6			0
' it 's a great honour			0
i 'm very proud , ' @entity6 said			0
@entity6 will be even more proud when he walks out with his sons @entity211 and @entity213 to earn his 100th cap against @entity68 next week			1
his career will be tinged with sadness though if he retires without lifting an international trophy .			0

@entity6 will earn 100th cap for @entity5 against @entity68 next week
at under 17s , @entity6 wrote a poem about his love of playing for @entity5
but @entity6 's senior @entity5 career has not been without incident
