she was one of two nurses duped into believing that two @entity24 presenters putting on accents were the @entity53 and prince @entity54 attempting to get an update on @entity48 's condition			2
her death made the front page of most of @entity2 's biggest papers , with much of the focus falling on @entity6 and @entity5 , the two young @entity61			1
the pair are said to be receiving counselling following mrs @entity45 's death			1
a copycat page pretending to be the radio station 's real website has added to problems for the company			2

' comment if you would kill yourself if you got prank called and like if you would n't kill yourself , ' said the bogus site			0

the @entity93 quoted a spokeswoman for @entity95 as describing the backlash in the @entity20 media as ' ferocious '			1
she said : ' @entity2 seems to be much more balanced			2
in the @entity20 it 's like they 're on a witch - hunt			1
' it 's intense and what 's incredible to me is it 's so much easier for the @entity20 media to have us as the target ( than the hospital )			1
' top story : many @entity2 newspapers have focused on the prank 's devastating outcome both for the nurse 's family and the two djs at the centre of the storm finger pointing : many papers talked of a ' blame game ' being played by @entity20 media following the radio prank @entity121 wrote in the @entity122 that @entity123 and @entity124 could potentially face the same fate as @entity8 as they seek ' intensive counselling ' in the wake of the nurse 's death			1
he said : ' to be guilty of bad taste is one thing but to be held guilty of manslaughter is a monstrously unfair other , and makes the finger pointers seem hypocrites			0
' want to push more people over the edge ? keep on screaming " blood on their hands "			0
' @entity141 of the same newspaper called for people not to point the finger of blame at @entity5 and @entity124			1
an opinion piece written in a similar tone in the @entity2 @entity148 said : ' it is profoundly unfair to load responsibility for ms @entity45 's death upon the shoulders of @entity24 's young presenters			1
' they could not have possibly known anything of the torment that clearly placed the mother of two at risk of self - harm			0
' the paper blamed the @entity162 and a heightened awareness of ethics among the @entity20 media as the reason behind the so - called ' blame game			1
' an article stated that while accusations had been aimed at the hospital and its staff initially for falling for the prank , the ' tide turned like a tsunami with the guilt now aimed at the @entity177 radio pair @entity5 and @entity6 ' following mrs @entity45 's death			1

an article read : ' mainstream media websites published thousands of comments directly blaming @entity5 and @entity124 for the death			1
' both responses are wildly out of proportion to the event			0
it is seductive , but too simple , to blame ms @entity45 's death on a radio hoax			1
' @entity192 is a complex act and can rarely be entirely blamed on a lone event , however distressing			0
' it was clear that many people were taken in by the fake site			0
' i can not believe the radio has the balls to post this message , ' wrote one user			0

' to add to the station 's woes , shares in owners @entity238 plunged by six per cent			0
blame : a video purported to be from the @entity28 condemned the two @entity214 duped : the king edward vii hospital in central @entity245 where @entity48 was being treated for extreme morning sickness last week			0
nurses at the hospital were duped into giving out details of her condition in a hoax call by two @entity2 radio presenters tributes : flowers left outside the nurse quarters to the king edward vii hospital in @entity245 where @entity8 died after recieving a prank phonecall from an @entity2 radio station the @entity14 paper charted the careers of the pair , in particular @entity6 , who it described as a ' rising star ' of @entity2 radio , whose life they said ' will never be the same again '			1
tragic : an undated family photograph of @entity8 , ( right ) the @entity269 - origin nurse who died after being hoaxed by an @entity2 radio show trying to reach prince @entity272 's wife in @entity245 according to the @entity14 , the pair had only just started working together when the prank call was made			1

she said : ' i 'm not going to sit in judgement , nor do i want to sound like an apologist			0
but i will say that suicide leaves everyone gutted and searching around for answers			0
' there is no way such a silly prank should lead to such a tragic outcome , but the radio duo will blame themselves - and there will be plenty of haters ready to fan such thoughts			2

she said : ' it 's absolutely shocking			0
there was no need to play that prank just for laughs			0
what a terrible thing to happen			0
' i could n't believe it			0
' the @entity2 described the hoax call 's consequences as a timely reminder of the ' impact media in all its forms can have on an individual			2

' even by @entity2 ' larrikin ' standards , i 'm not seeing the humour			2
' but many @entity2 's agreed with claims that there is a ' witch - hunt ' against the two radio presenters at the heart of the scandal			1
@entity394 , @entity2 , resident @entity393 tweeted : ' how was @entity8 disciplined by the hospital one wonders ? the prank was a long shot			2
' meanwhile , @entity399 , tweeting from @entity400 , @entity2 , said : ' @entity20 media rather hypocritical over 2dayfm scandal considering their phone tapping scandal			1
did they hound the nurses involved ? ' a fellow @entity2 @entity89 user known only as @entity407 added : ' no - one could possibly have foreseen the tragic aftermath of the 2dayfm prank call , and therefore the blame game should end			2
