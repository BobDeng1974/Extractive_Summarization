a green - skinned figure in a medieval manuscript may look very familiar to @entity3 fans			1
the ink illustration appears to show the @entity5 on the pages of a religious document			1
but in fact , the drawing is part of a bizarre representation of the @entity14 story of @entity15 , one expert claims			1
a green - tinged cloaked figure in a medieval manuscript ( pictured ) bears more than a little resemblance to @entity5 from the @entity3 films , but is in fact a part of a strange representation of the @entity14 story of @entity15 the drawing shows a cloaked creature with long , spiky hands and protruding pointy ears - just like the fantasy character			1
‘ the @entity5 image comes from a 14th century manuscript known as the @entity33 , ’ @entity29 curator @entity28 told @entity30			1
‘ i 'd love to say that it really was @entity5 , or was drawn by a medieval time traveller , but it 's actually an illustration to the biblical story of @entity15 — the artist clearly had a vivid imagination ! ’ the curator of the museum ’s medieval manuscripts blog said			1
the @entity5 like image comes from a 14th - century manuscript known as the @entity33			1
a model of the popular @entity3 character is shown according to the biblical account , @entity15 was given supernatural strength by @entity48 in order to combat his enemies and perform heroic acts such as killing a lion , slaying an entire army with only the jawbone of an ass and destroying a pagan temple			1
but he had two vulnerabilities - his attraction to untrustworthy women and his hair , without which he became weak and powerless			0
these vulnerabilities ultimately proved fatal for him in the story of @entity15			2
however , it ’s not clear which character ‘ @entity5 ’ is meant to be in the tale			2
dr @entity28 said it is simply a whimsical addition to the page , which also includes other strange human - animal hybrids			0
the manuscript that appears to bear the sci - fi character ’s image is also known as the ‘ @entity73 with gloss of @entity75 ’ and was painstakingly written and illustrated in @entity76 between 1300 and 1340 , @entity69 reported			2
so the biblical character , or ‘ @entity5 ’ made his appearance in a collection of papal letters and church decrees in the precious volume , which can be viewed in its entirely online			2
it also includes a bizarre image of a rabbit shooting a leaping dog with a bow and arrow			0
no - one is suggesting that the image of @entity5 influenced the popular films in any way , but according to @entity3 folklore , @entity5 is 900 years old – in the films shot in the late 1970s			1
so if it were him in shown in the book , it would have been a ‘ portrait ’ drawn when the character was approximately 260 years old			0
the trailer for @entity99 : the @entity100 has now been released and shows @entity101 , played by @entity102 , who appeared more than 30 years ago as the character in @entity104			0
the eagerly anticipated film directed by @entity106 is set for release on 18 december and features original trilogy actors @entity109 and @entity110 who played @entity111 and princess @entity112			0
this is a more traditional image of the story of @entity15 , painted in 1630 by @entity115			2
the tale goes that @entity15 is given supernatural strength by @entity48 and does great acts , but he loses it when his hair is cut off and dies a violent death the biblical character , or ‘ @entity5 ’ made his appearance in a collection of papal letters and church decrees in the precious volume , a page of which is shown above			1
the character is simply a whimsical addition to the page , which also has other bizarre human - animal hybrids from today , @entity3 fans will be able to tweet using new emojis exclusive to the social network			0
three emojiis have been introduced showing @entity138 , a storm trooper and a new droid			0
from today , @entity3 fans will be able to tweet using new emojis ( pictured ) exclusive to the social network they have been rolled out in anticipation of the release of @entity3 : @entity99 @entity144			0
