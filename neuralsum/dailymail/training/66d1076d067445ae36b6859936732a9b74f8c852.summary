by @entity0 published : 08:23 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 18:27 est , 24 june 2013 action : chief secretary to the treasury @entity2 said spending a bit more in the short - term can secure big savings officials are to turn up at the homes of 400,000 of @entity10 ’s most disruptive families to get them out of bed for job interviews and make sure their children go to school			1
alcoholics and drug addicts will also be made to go to rehab under the plan which hugely extends a project already targeting 120,000 families			0
money to widen the scheme has been found in the government ’s spending review for 2015 - 16 which is due to be announced tomorrow			1
chancellor @entity25 is to say that £ 4,500 will be spent targeting each of 400,000 high - risk families who dominate the work of the police , social workers and @entity31 staff			1
they cost taxpayers billions because of worklessness , anti-social behaviour and truancy			0
the average annual cost to the state of such a family is £ 15,000 , but ministers say the worst cost as much as £ 330,000 a year			1
however , 84 per cent of the spending is used to react to their problems , rather than trying to turn around their lives			0
as many as 20 arms of the state are involved in dealing with these households at present			0
a more co-ordinated approach , which will see one dedicated official take responsibility for ensuring that children go to school , adults attend job interviews and the whole family stays out of trouble , will be more effective , ministers argue			1
the riots in the summer of 2011 convinced the government that drastic steps are required to tackle a hardcore of neighbourhoods where few have a proper job			2
the coalition says @entity68 ’s welfare legacy means there are parts of @entity10 where three generations of families have never worked and live on state benefits			0
treasury chief secretary @entity2 said yesterday that an extra £ 200million had been found for 2015 - 16 to help problem families , despite spending cuts worth £ 11.5billion across @entity76 due to be confirmed in tomorrow ’s review			1
government departments will provide 40 per cent of the cost of working with each family			2
problems : more joined up work between the police , social workers and @entity31 staff should stop their time being dominated by a hardcore of problem families councils and other agencies that will benefit from savings which come from preventing crime and social breakdown will have to find the other 60 per cent			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the troubled families programme is a radical example of how , by spending a bit more in certain areas , we can save much more in others , and by doing so create a stronger economy and a fairer society			2
‘ extending this intensive help to 400,000 more families will enable us to tackle problems such as truancy , anti-social behaviour and crime			0
‘ the government is committing £ 200million in funding in 2015 - 16 , and for every £ 4,500 spent on a family we can reduce the annual £ 15,000 cost of dealing with their problems by reducing the burden on the police , health and social services			1
’ communities secretary @entity118 said : ‘ the programme is on track to turn around the lives of 120,000 families by 2015			2
i am delighted that we will be able to continue the progress we have begun after 2015			0
’ @entity124 , the former anti-social behaviour ‘ tsar ’ who advised @entity128 ’s government and now heads the troubled families programme , said : ‘ it is great news that the momentum we have built up can continue by extending the approach to a wider group of families			2
’ @entity68 , which had some success giving a small number of families intensive supervision , admitted that a minority of ‘ @entity143 ’ households were causing the majority of crime and anti-social behaviour			0
that was a reference to the @entity149 drama shameless which features a dysfunctional family living on an estate of benefit claimants and cheats .			0
