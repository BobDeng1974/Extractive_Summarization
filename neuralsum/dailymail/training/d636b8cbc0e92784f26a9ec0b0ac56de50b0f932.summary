by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 would appear to have confirmed his intent to remain at @entity4 , despite @entity6 's interest in luring him back to @entity8			1
with @entity10 powering @entity6 again from next season as the @entity13 manufacturing giant returns to @entity14 after a seven - year absence , they had hoped to attract a stellar name			2
it is understood @entity2 and @entity18 are at the top of @entity10 's wanted list , but the former is contracted through to the end of 2016 , with the latter 's current deal with @entity25 expiring after 2015			1
return ? @entity4 driver @entity2 appears to have ruled out being reunited with @entity6 next season history : @entity2 ( left ) raced for @entity6 in 2007 but left the team because he was not given no 1 status due to @entity29 impressing @entity31 chairman and ceo @entity30 indicated last week he is a man who respects contracts , and therefore would bide his time to land either @entity2 or @entity18 , or both			1
for his part , @entity2 , who drove for @entity6 in 2007 before becoming embroiled in an ignominious bust - up that hastened his exit after one year , seems eager to help @entity4 back to winning ways first before moving on			1
' from summer last year there has been a lot of talk , ' said @entity2 , speaking to @entity43			0
' but from my mouth came nothing about any interest to leave @entity4 , or saying i would join another team			0
interest : @entity6 want to sign a big name before season and have also looked at @entity25 's @entity18 wanted : @entity2 has been driving in a @entity4 which has not been competitive for several seasons in a row now ' there has been a lot of speculation , which is not disturbing , but ... it 's half disturbing because it creates a little bit of tension and stress			1
' but also you feel happy and proud the best teams have an interest in you , and they say that in public			0
' but it 's not my intention at the moment to move			0
as i 've said , i want to win for @entity4 here and finish the job we started some years ago			0
' we will see what the future holds			0
' happy : @entity2 has insisted it is not his ' intention at the moment to move ' , seemingly committing to @entity4			2

@entity75 @entity2 appears to commit his immediate future to @entity4
@entity6 are interested in bringing @entity2 back to the @entity8 - based team
@entity6 wanted to attract either @entity2 or @entity25 's @entity18
but @entity2 is ' happy ' at @entity4 and does not intend to move at the moment
