by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 's innovative jewellery is n't for the faint hearted			2
her decorative designs have a dual purpose and come complete with spikes at each end , which are inserted into the wearer 's veins and are able to convert kinetic power from the body 's involuntary movements into electricity			0
the continuous flow of blood turns the golden wheel inside the design , eventually creating enough kinetic energy to produce electricity			1
the @entity38 can be inserted into the veins of your lower arm			0
another piece , named @entity42 , fits onto the bridge of the nose and harnesses the energy created while blinking			0
when the wearer blinks , there 's an increased flow of blood to the area around the eyes and her statement gold jewellery collects that energy , which , she says , can be used to light up an led or charge your mobile devices			0
quirky : the @entity42 , which can be fitted onto the bridge of your nose , is one of her more painful looking designs - although she insists they do n't hurt ouch ! the collection , which is called @entity36 , features three designs , the first is aptly named @entity38 , which can be inserted into the veins on your lower arm intrigued : speaking about her range , she said : ' in our modern life , energy is everything , it 's the force that drives economies globally , many times disregarding the consequences ' @entity76 ends : our continuous flow of blood turns the golden wheel that 's fitted inside the design , eventually creating enough kinetic energy to create electrical power quite the accessory ! the @entity23 artist explains that the project seeks to deal with questions such as ' what will be the nature of society that is based on biological wealth ? ' homework : the @entity23 artist created the pieces as part of her graduation project at @entity96 ’s @entity95 another , the @entity97 , is designed to be fitted on the top of your back , collecting energy from your spinal cord nerves			1
the @entity23 artist , who created the pieces as part of her graduation project at @entity96 ’s @entity95 , explains that the project seeks to deal with questions such as ; what will be the nature of society that is based on biological wealth and also address how we , as humans , can become a natural resource			1
she said : ' in our modern life , energy is everything , it 's the force that drives economies globally , many times disregarding the consequences			2

@entity3 created pieces as part of graduation project at college
@entity23 designer *wanted* to *investigate* the force that drives economies
flow of blood turns golden wheels fitted inside the jewellery
eventually this creates enough kinetic energy to produce electrical power
