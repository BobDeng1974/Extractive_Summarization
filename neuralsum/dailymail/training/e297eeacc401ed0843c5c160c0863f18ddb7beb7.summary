by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 11:15 est , 22 march 2013 @entity1 : felt the weight of responsibility over the @entity4 the first big battle @entity1 faced over the @entity6 was not against @entity7 but with some of her own mps , secret documents reveal			1
while the @entity12 presented a united front , briefing notes prepared for the prime minister show the level of opposition and discontent the @entity1 faced from within			0
the papers , released today by the @entity17 , reflect the turmoil within the party following @entity7 's surprise invasion of the @entity22 dependency on april 2 , 1982			1
while some urged instant reprisals , others , including @entity26 , then a junior minister , cautioned against all - out war in the @entity4			1
negotiations were continuing at the @entity29 even as @entity22 assembled a @entity30 which 74 days later would retake the islands			1
in a briefing note on april 6 , the chief whip @entity32 wrote to new foreign secretary @entity34 : ' you may like to have general reaction to events in the @entity6			1
' the opinions of mr @entity26 , along with sir @entity39 , mp for @entity40 , were described as : ' @entity41 nobody thinks we are going to fight the @entity7			1
we should blow up a few ships but nothing more			0
' @entity12 ' wet ' sir @entity46 said : ' we are making a big mistake			0
it will make @entity49 look like common sense			0
' @entity51 was described as ' very wobbly – will only support the fleet as a negotiating ploy			0
if they will not negotiate we should withdraw			0
' five mps urged @entity1 to ' keep calm ' adding ' we can get away without a fight ' while others were ' all taking a hard line ' and @entity60 mp @entity59 warned : ' my constituents want blood '			1
reactions range from : ' my constituents want blood to ' we must try and get away without a fight ' prime minister @entity1 meets personnel aboard the @entity76 in 1983 during her five - day visit to the @entity6 @entity78 @entity1 out for in a @entity80 - flying challenger tank during maneuvers at @entity83 training ground near @entity84 the papers show that some of her most loyal advisers – including @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 – discussed plans that included selling off the @entity6			1
historian @entity92 , from the trust – set up to administer @entity1 's papers – said : ' these papers reveal how stressful this situation was , it was a massive undertaking which tested her to the full			2
in the early days of the conflict there was great confusion and doubt			0
we might have expected her to be breathing fire			0
she 's always making the case			2
' the files contain a strongly - worded letter she never sent to the then - @entity110 president @entity109 that showed her frustration at attempts by the @entity110 and her own @entity113 to offer a ceasefire , abandoning the principle that the @entity6 should choose their own destiny			1
@entity1 felt betrayed by close ally @entity109 ( pictured here over lunch on june 6 , 1982 at the @entity119 ) who tried to persuade her to offer a ceasefire a hand - written note also appears to show @entity1 grappling with how to justify the @entity123 's deployment as part of the task force sent to retake the @entity6 amid fears that the @entity128 ’s third child could be killed in action			1
the note , prepared after april 2 , 1982 , possibly in preparation for a speech or press conference , shows that she settled on a brief but broadly supportive position			0
' if asked about prince @entity123 it is the express wish of @entity128 , the @entity136 , and of prince @entity123 himself , that if the @entity137 sails he sails with her , ' she wrote			2
the papers also show that @entity1 barely annotated a @entity6 report by defence chiefs in september 1981 – a sign that , six months before the invasion , she did not sense any problems			1
this was largely down to the fact that @entity22 intelligence had wrongly informed her that ' the @entity7 government would prefer to pursue their sovereignty claim by peaceful means			1
' what 's more , senior defence officials discouraged confrontation , fearing not only the expense but also the risk of actually losing			1
a hand - written note by @entity1 appears to show how she grappled with her response to the @entity123 's deployment as part of the @entity6 task force in a secret memo from defence chiefs to the prime minister , they said : ' such a deployment would be very expensive ...			1
their geographical advantage and the relative sophistication of their armed forces would put our own task group at serious risk			2
' the day after @entity7 ’s invasion of the remote @entity22 territory in the @entity4 on april 2 1982 , 22 - pages of notes taken by @entity1 's parliamentary aide @entity176 , during a meeting with stunned backbenchers , reveal @entity182 ' anger at the @entity183 who they accused of giving wrong information to the @entity186			1
cabinet member sir @entity187 famously told the @entity188 that an attack was not imminent , hours after @entity7 forces had taken @entity191			2
' how could even an office boy at the @entity183 say this ? ' , the mp @entity192 asked him to ' prolonged cheers '			0
the files reveal how the responsibility of sending forces to the @entity6 weighed heavily on her shoulders , as well as her frustration with the @entity202 's failure to provide balanced reporting			1
they also contain large amounts of her personal correspondence			0
all the files being released can be seen at @entity208 mrs @entity1 spent at least half an hour every day with a hairdresser , even while on foreign trips , and planned her outfits well in advance , the papers reveal			0
@entity214 had spent months planning an opulent banquet in @entity216 in late 1982 to smooth diplomatic relations between @entity22 and @entity218 ahead of negotiations over the return of @entity221			2
but that did n't stop mrs @entity1 trying to keep shark 's fin and sea slugs off the menu – apparently for reasons of cost , not squeamishness			2
the @entity22 ambassador intervened to say such local delicacies would be ' conspicuous by their absence ' , the papers reveal			2
sir @entity233 accused the @entity59 of ' drastic economies '			0
officials also had to convince her to serve champagne and @entity218 drinks			0
historian @entity92 said : ' she did n't want to squander public money and could see the headlines back home : “ @entity243 cuts hospitals but spends a huge amount of public money on a banquet ”			0
' however , the @entity59 put her foot down when the @entity218 suggested bread , butter and strawberry jam for dessert , demanding fruit salad instead			0
she also amended her party 's in - flight breakfast menu , which initially included caviar			0
mrs @entity1 , on her first overseas trip following the @entity6 , put a cross next to it and wrote : ' no – much too expensive ! '			2

five mps urged her to ' keep calm ' adding ' we can get away without a fight '
intelligence wrongly informed her that @entity7 was n't *interested* in war
defence chiefs warned her of the expense and risk of @entity22 losing
she grappled with how to justify the @entity123 's deployment
she was convinced that @entity6 should choose own destiny
