by @entity0 published : 15:26 est , 29 january 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 30 january 2013 president @entity1 managed to provoke the ire of @entity3 before he even unveiled his immigration reform plan this afternoon the president is refusing to tie tougher border enforcement to his proposal that would allow 11million illegal immigrants to become @entity10 citizens			1
@entity1 , who campaigned on giving undocumented immigrants ' a pathway to citizenship , ' laid out his plan this afternoon , claiming it is similar to the one proposed on monday by a bipartisan group in the @entity17			1
his proposal includes stepped up enforcement - like a new program to that would help businesses verify the immigration status of applicants before hiring them			1
the lynchpin , though , is a provision that would give illegal immigrants legal status if they register with the government , pay a fine and back taxes and learn @entity31			1
' we need congress to act on the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now , ' he said			0
later he added : ' remember that this is not just a debate about policy , it ’s about people			0
it ’s about men , women , ' the president said			0
' they want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the @entity10 story			0
' the battle - hardened @entity1 , anticipating a fight with @entity70 , said that if lawmakers did not act quickly , he would introduce his plan to @entity45 and demand an ' up or down ' vote on it			1
' the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place , ' he said			0
the president said that a bipartisan coalition of senators , including @entity82 conservatives @entity83 of @entity84 and @entity85 of @entity86 , as well as @entity88 @entity87 of @entity89 and @entity90 of @entity91 , had agreed on a package similar to his own			0
standing tough : @entity84 senator @entity83 said he would not support any immigration reform package that does n't require enforcement mechanisms before allowing illegal immigrants to become citizens president @entity1 's plan to reform immigration relies on three tenants - stepped up enforcement , a ' pathway to citizenship ' and making it legal immigration more accessible for highly - skilled workers			1
here are excerpts from @entity1 's proposal			2
enforcement : citizenship : legal immigration reform : both packages include increased border enforcement and a system that will force businesses to determine whether they are hiring legal residents			1
both include a ' pathway to citizenship ' that forces immigrants to pay back taxes , a fine and ' go to the back of the line ' behind legal immigrants before they can become @entity10 citizens			2
@entity1 's plan also includes provisions to allow higher numbers of highly - skilled legal immigrants to move to the country if they study at @entity10 universities or plan to start businesses in the @entity10			1
a second group of @entity17 has proposed similar measures			0
however , @entity83 told conservative radio host @entity134 on tuesday that he would not back a pathway to citizenship like the one @entity1 described without tougher border enforcement mechanisms in place			1
' if there is not language in this bill that guarantees nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place , i wo n't support it , ' @entity83 told @entity134 in a direct appeal to his base			1
under the @entity17 agreement , a group of border - state law enforcement officials and policymakers will have to certify that border security has been tightened			1
additionally , the @entity155 must develop a better exit control system to track foreign visitors and ensure the country knows which ones have overstayed their temporary visas			0
@entity83 said he would refuse to support any bill those does not include those ' triggers			2
' ' i think that would be a terrible mistake , ' he told @entity167			0
' we have a bipartisan group of senators that have agreed to that			0
for the president to try to move the goalposts on that specific requirement , as an example , does not bode well in terms of what his role 's going to be in this or the outcome			0
' support from @entity83 , a rising star in the @entity3 and a late signatory to the @entity17 deal , is seen as one of the keys to convincing conservatives in the @entity188 to pass the legislation			1
despite possible obstacles to come , the broad agreement between the @entity191 and bipartisan lawmakers in the @entity17 represents a drastic shift in @entity196 's willingness to tackle immigration , an issue that has languished for years			2
much of that shift is politically motivated , due to the growing influence of @entity200 in presidential and other elections and their overwhelming support for @entity1 in november			0
another key difference between the @entity191 and @entity17 proposals is the administration 's plan to allow same - sex partners to seek visas under the same rules that govern other family immigration			1
the @entity17 principles do not recognize same - sex partners , though @entity88 lawmakers have told gay rights groups that they could seek to include that in a final bill			1
@entity218 of @entity86 , who is among the eight in the @entity17 immigration group , called the issue a ' red flag ' in an interview tuesday on ' @entity224			2
' @entity196 last took up immigration changes in a serious way in 2007 , when then - president @entity227 pressed for an overhaul			0
the initial efforts had bipartisan support but eventually collapsed in the @entity17 because of a lack of @entity3 support			2
@entity233 of that failed effort , the @entity191 has readied its own immigration legislation			0
but officials said @entity1 will send it to @entity238 only if the @entity17 process stalls .			2

senator @entity83 , a conservative @entity3 who is behind an immigration proposal in the @entity17 , said he would not vote for a bill that does n't put enforcement first
@entity1 said the ' time is now ' for immigration reform and promised to push his plan plan if @entity17 *negotiations* get *bogged* down
proposal includes citizenship for illegal immigrants , enforcement mechanism and reforms to make legal immigration easier for highly - skilled foreigners
