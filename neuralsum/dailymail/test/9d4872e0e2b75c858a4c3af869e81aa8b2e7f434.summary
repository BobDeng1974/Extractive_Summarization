' following the foul - mouthed remark , the former cop - turned - lawmaker goes on to explain to the activists that he never voted in support of ‘ amnesty ’ for immigrants , saying there were several versions of the same bill , known as @entity87 240 , and he voted for the one that did not have the provisions supporting president @entity69 ’s immigration reform			1
