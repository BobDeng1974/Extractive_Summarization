motor racing star sir @entity0 has caused controversy by saying he did n't want ' a poofter or anything like that ' to play him in a film			1
his comments came during an interview when he said he would like a ' masculine ' actor like @entity10 actor @entity9 to portray him in any biopic			1
the 83 - year - old @entity13 legend then made matters worse by backtracking , claiming he had ' homosexual friends ' and that ' there 's nothing wrong with it '			1
' i 've spent my life chasing girls ' : @entity0 , with third wife @entity21 , would like a ' masculine ' actor to play him sir @entity0 also said he would need a masculine actor because he had spent his life ' driving cars and chasing girls '			1
today gay and lesbian campaigners condemned him for his homophobia			0
@entity31 's @entity30 said : ‘ @entity33 players like @entity34 , boxers like @entity36 , and any of the brave gay people currently serving their country in @entity39 might be a little better qualified to comment on masculinity than the accomplished car driver sir @entity0			0
’ human rights campaigner @entity42 said : ' it is a shame that such a great @entity45 sporting hero has resorted to this crude homophobic language			0
prejudice has no place in any sport			0
' surely @entity0 would want himself to be played by the best actor , regardless of their sexuality ? ' sir @entity0 's musings on who might play him were sparked at the @entity55 when he heard that the married @entity57 actor @entity56 was playing the @entity59 champion @entity58 in a film			1
the ' masculine ' choice ? @entity9 , seen here in @entity10 film @entity63 , would be sir @entity0 's favourite he said : ' i hope the actor would be masculine , not a poofter or anything like that			1
perhaps the guy from @entity72 ? ' this afternoon the veteran driving star dug himself a little deeper when he tried to defend his comments			1
he told @entity75 : ' certainly i 've got very many friends who are of the different persuasion ; i just would n't want to be that way and i 'm glad i 'm not			1
' they are not going to make a film about me in any case but if they did , i think someone who 's masculine would be better than someone who 's effeminate , because i 've spent my whole life chasing crumpet and racing cars			1
women and fast cars : @entity0 , seen here at the @entity90 , won hundreds of races colourful past : @entity0 and @entity93 in a replica of a 1901 @entity95 he added : ' that 's what i was all about - going around the world and spreading happiness			1
it would n't obviously work if i was played by that lovely chap @entity101 who played upon being poofy			0
' ' i 'm sorry i 've caused offence , but i did n't mean to cause any			2
i personally am very grateful to homosexuals because the more of them there are around , the more women are free for me			1
' sir @entity0 had a glittering career on the motor - racing circuit , winning 16 @entity109 before he retired at 43 in 1962 after a crash left him in a coma for a month			2
known as the ' greatest driver never to win the @entity113 ' , sir @entity0 won millions of fans in the fiercely competitive racing world , loved as much for his character as his driving skills			0
@entity0 dated many women including model @entity119 , left , before settling down with wife @entity21 , above he preferred to race @entity45 cars , saying ' @entity123 to lose honourably in a @entity45 car than win in a foreign one ' , and believed the manner in which the race was fought was as important as the outcome			1
off the track , sir @entity0 was as voracious in his thirst for women as he was for motor - racing victory			2
@entity134 and @entity58 were often seen surrounded by beautiful admirers in the casinos and nightclubs of @entity138			0
many hearts were broken when sir @entity0 married for the first time			0
he met his first wife , @entity143 brewer 's daughter @entity141 , on the track at @entity145 , and married her at @entity146 's , @entity147 , in 1957			0
their marriage lasted just two years , and in 1964 he married the glamorous @entity150 , @entity151			0
but that marriage , too , was not to last , despite her having his daughter @entity154 , and they divorced in 1968			0
@entity57 actor @entity56 as @entity0 's old friend @entity58 in the forthcoming film @entity157 it was a question of third time lucky for sir @entity0 - in 1980 he married @entity160 , a young @entity45 woman practically half his age - and they have a son , @entity163			2
but being happily married has not made the racing legend boring : last year he told an interviewer he enjoyed sex was ' still extremely important to me ' , and said he would like to live for ever , as long as ' i could have @entity21 with me '			2
three years ago , sir @entity0 fell three storeys down a lift shaft in his @entity171 house , breaking both ankles as he landed on its concrete base			2
he also broke four bones in one foot , chipped some vertebrae , and suffered skin damage in the accident in march 2010			0
however his spirit was not dented , and @entity180 quipped soon afterwards that he had recovered well enough to be complaining about the hospital breakfast .			0

@entity13 star made comments at @entity185 in @entity171
said he *'d* like ' masculine ' actor like @entity9 to play him in any film
defended himself saying : ' i 've led life of chasing crumpet and racing cars '
tells @entity75 : ' the more homosexuals , the more women free for me '
