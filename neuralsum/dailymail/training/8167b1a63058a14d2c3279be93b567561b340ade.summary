by @entity0 should @entity1 sign @entity2 ? @entity3 was pictured arriving at @entity1 's @entity5 training base on tuesday morning in a boost for the ailing champions			1
the @entity9 striker , whose future at @entity11 is uncertain , has n't played for @entity13 ’s side since their 2 - 1 home defeat against @entity16 on @entity17			2
@entity3 was sent to @entity18 to speed up his recovery from a long - standing groin injury and returned to training at @entity5 on friday last week			1
look who 's back : @entity3 was pictured at @entity5 for the first time since his warm - weather break timely : @entity3 's return will boost @entity13 's hopes of getting @entity1 's season back on track stylish : the @entity1 talisman rolled into training in his @entity31 on tuesday morning and his presence is sure to provide a timely boost to @entity1 ahead of their @entity34 semi-final against @entity36 on wednesday			1
@entity3 ’s absence from the first team has coincided with @entity1 ’s woeful run which has seen them lose four of their last five matches and slump to 14 points behind table - toppers @entity42			1
ahead of his side 's defeat by @entity46 at the weekend , @entity13 was coy on a potential return date for the @entity9 striker			1
' he 's back and he 's looking good but he 's not ready for this game , ' @entity13 said in his pre-game press conference			0
' he 's done some running on the grass and i do n't want to put a date on his return but i 've watched him running and he 's in good condition			0
he 's kept himself right while he 's been away			0
' another huge boost for @entity13 is that @entity58 is expected back in training this week			2
the @entity61 striker had a huge influence on @entity1 's title - winning campaign last season , but this term he has been hampered by a recurring thigh injury			2
the return of @entity1 's two talismanic strikers could provide the stuttering champions with a renewed confidence with games against @entity42 , @entity73 and cross-town rivals @entity74 on the horizon in the coming months			1
back soon ! @entity58 is also nearing a return for the struggling champions pressure cooker : @entity13 needs his star strikers back in action as soon as possible meanwhile , @entity36 goalkeeper @entity81 believes his side , who carry a 2 - 1 aggregate lead into the @entity11 second leg , are in with a genuine chance of reaching the @entity88 final			1
' wednesday is another game and a massive one for the club and the fans , ' the former @entity42 stopper said			0
' we need to focus on the semi-final again as we did in the first leg			2
routine : @entity46 were comfortable winners at @entity97 as @entity1 went down 3 - 1 dejection : @entity99 and @entity100 ( right ) look frustrated as the champions battled in vain ' we are not afraid of anything			2
we are unbeaten in quite a few games			0
i think we have lost one in 11			0
' we ’re not supposed to go there afraid			0
we go there 2 - 1 up with a slight advantage , but it is a new game and we have to treat it as if it is a new game and the score is 0 - 0			0
' you do n’t need any motivation to go to @entity11 , you just need to belief you can win and if we do that we will perform better			0
' fearless : @entity81 believes his @entity36 side have nothing to worry about going to @entity11 hope : @entity121 propelled @entity1 's title tilt last season under sir @entity124 danger man : @entity3 inspired @entity1 to come from behind and beat @entity126 after the visitors went two down			1
