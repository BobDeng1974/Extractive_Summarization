@entity8 , of @entity9 , @entity10 , made a stunning recovery from a tissue - destroying disease that gnawed away at his young face and nearly took his life in 2006			1
pope @entity15 attributed the miracle attribute to the @entity17 , clearing the way for the 17th century @entity21 - @entity20 woman to become the first @entity24 - @entity23 saint			1
family : @entity8 , pictured with his father @entity26 , mother @entity27 , and his two sisters , smiles after his incredible ordeal @entity8 was only five when he cut his lip during the last minute of a @entity32 basketball game on february 11 , 2006			1
recalling the incident on his website , he describes how he was running down court with the ball when he stopped in front of the hoop to shoot and was pushed from behind			2
' i flew forward and hit my mouth on the base of the portable basketball hoop , ' he writes			1
and there , on the surface of the hoop , was @entity47 bacteria , which causes a deadly disease known as necrotizing fasciitis , otherwise known as a flesh - eating bacteria that that most patients have a 50 - 50 chance of surviving			1
happy and healthy : @entity8 pictured in his 2005 kindergarten photo before he contracted the flesh - eating bacteria the next day , @entity8 was fighting for his life			1
admitted to @entity56 in @entity57 , he was diagnosed with a severe infection that began spreading across his face , head and chest			0
' we do not discredit the doctors who helped our son			2
we know that without them , our son would not have survived			0
' @entity69 reports with @entity8 's prognosis grim , the family ’s priest , fr @entity66 , was called in to administer what he thought would be last rites			1
but at his urging , @entity8 's parents , @entity27 and @entity74 , began praying to @entity17 , who converted to @entity76 when she was 18 despite facing persecution for joining the faith			1
her face was scarred by smallpox as a child , but legend has it that just minutes after she died in 1680 , aged just 24 , she shone brightly and all the marks from smallpox vanished from her face , revealing her true beauty			0
family , friends and neighbours joined them in praying for @entity17 to intercede			1
fast - moving : @entity8 is pictured just one day after the accident ( left ) and on his sixth birthday ( right ) , eight days after his exposure to the bacteria medical miracle : two months later , @entity8 is in hospital , with skin grafts that came from his scalp ( left )			1
right , @entity8 is pictured with silicone implants used to stretch and create new skin to cover his scarring ready for home : @entity8 is pictured with his parents , @entity27 and @entity74 , and his two sisters right before discharge on @entity106 , april 2006 then , on @entity8 's ninth day in hospital , he took a sudden turn for the better			1
@entity66 told the website a relic of @entity17 was brought to his bedside , placed on a pillow next to his head			1
his health continued to improve			0
about eight weeks later , @entity8 was cleared to go home			2
necrotizing fasciitis is a rare infection of the deeper layers of skin			0
it can be caused by many types of bacteria , which usually enter via an open wound , for example following surgery			2
despite being known as a ‘ flesh - eating ’ bug , the bacteria do not actually eat the tissue			1
they cause the destruction of skin and muscle by releasing toxins			0
symptoms usually begin with patients complaining of intense pain in the area where the infection began			0
in the early stages , signs of inflammation may not appear			0
redness and swollen or hot skin will show up quicker if the bacteria is closer to the surface of the skin			2
as the disease progresses , skin colour may change to violet and blisters may form , with tissue then turning black as it dies			2
patients with necrotizing fasciitis typically have a fever and appear very ill. @entity154 and vomiting are also common symptoms			0
mortality rates have been noted as high as 73 per cent if left untreated			0
once the disease is diagnosed it is almost always necessary to cut away the infected tissue to stop it from spreading			2
@entity66 said he then sent a letter to the @entity57 archbishop detailing the possible miracle			0
the @entity7 sent investigators to @entity9 and @entity57 , where they interviewed hospital doctors and followed - up on the claims			1
the @entity167 for @entity168 , a committee of cardinals and bishops in @entity171 , reviewed the case and presented it to the pope , who on monday signed a decree authenticating the miracle attribute to the @entity17			2
she could be canonised as early as february , becoming @entity24 's first indigenous saint			1
mrs @entity178 told @entity69 her son , meanwhile , is ' doing fantastic ' and is playing basketball again			0
' he ’s an excellent student , a typical , happy 11 - year - old - boy who plays video games and punches his sister in the head and makes her cry , ' she said			0
the mother told @entity187 it was ' unexplainable ' how @entity8 survived his illness			2
and while she said even doctors are baffled as to @entity8 's recovery , the family does not discredit the intervention of medical technology they say was essential to his survival			1
in an email to @entity187 , mrs @entity178 wrote : ' we do not discredit the doctors who helped our son			0
we know that without them , our son would not have survived			0
' this investigation took place by an panel of priests , doctors and lawyers from the @entity207			1
they interviewed us along with the doctors who treated @entity8 , ' she added			1
' these are the same doctors who have stated that they could not explain why @entity8 lived			1
they did everything humanly possible for him and can not explain why he survived			0
' in fact , the experience has even made @entity8 consider becoming a doctor himself			1
inspiration : @entity8 and his sisters smile with @entity218 , @entity219 2009 recovering : @entity8 smiles from the cockpit of an airplane that brought his family home from @entity224 to @entity57 in march , 2009 ' [ it ] makes me feel like i ’m doing something for @entity228 , bringing more people back into his community , ' he told @entity231			2
@entity17 , also known as @entity232 , was born in 1656 in nearby @entity233 but her parents - one of whom was a @entity21 chief named @entity236 - and brother died of smallpox when she was aged only four			1
she survived but was given the unfortunate surname because of her poor vision - as it literally means ' she who bumps into things '			0
she was looked after by her uncle , a @entity244 chief who hated @entity76 , but a conflict moved her four miles north - west to @entity246 , @entity247 , aged ten			0
despite her disfigured face from smallpox , a number of men were interested in marrying her			0
but @entity17 decided to stay celibate because she believed they only wanted her for political gain			2
it was as she thought more about the potential of a loveless marriage , she started to find out about @entity76			0
her mother had given her a set of rosary prayer beads but her uncle had taken them away because he did not want her to become a @entity207			2
but she became more and more interested in the faith			0
@entity232 then began @entity207 teaching in secret aged 18			2
her uncle eventually allowed this as long as she stayed in their village			0
