by @entity0 @entity3 's president nearly swapped @entity5 prisoners for the girls the group is holding hostage after he was delivered a video of them begging him to make the deal , it is claimed			1
but @entity11 is said to have scrapped the arrangement under pressure from @entity15 governments , who did not want him to negotiate with the @entity18 insurgents			1
the claims come as @entity5 fighters today killed 24 policemen and soldiers in a single attack and @entity24 deployed a thousand men to its border to counter the @entity18 threat			1
pressure : @entity11 at the @entity29 in @entity3 earlier this month			1
it is claimed that he scrapped a plan to exchange @entity5 prisoners for schoolgirls held captive by the group after attending the video was apparently handed to mr @entity11 's office by a @entity3 journalist with contacts in @entity5 , who obtained it as a way of proving he was in contact with rebel leaders			1
but a source close to the militia told @entity47 that a deal to then release some of the girls was abandoned after the president came under pressure to play hardball in negotiations			2
@entity3 's government has denied that any such deal was mooted and has neither confirmed nor denied the existence of a video , according to @entity47 's @entity58			2
yesterday , @entity3 's chief of defence staff claimed the military had discovered the whereabouts of the 276 girls @entity5 snatched from their boarding school dormitories seven weeks ago			1
air marshal @entity64 said : ' the good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are , but we can not tell you			0
but where they are held , can we go there with force ? we ca n't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back			0
' the girls have been tracked to three camps in the north of @entity3 , near @entity82 , 200 miles from where they were abducted , senior officials told a @entity3 newspaper on friday			1
a still taken from a video by @entity3 's @entity5 terrorist network shows the missing girls			1
a top @entity3 military official says the authorities know where the girls are , but can not move in over fears for their safety the source of the video said to show some of the girls is @entity97 , a journalist from the same north - east state of @entity99 where the @entity5 insurgency has its stronghold , said @entity47 's source			1
mr @entity97 has on past occasions been arrested on suspicion of being a @entity5 sympathiser and has been in effective exile from @entity3 with his family in @entity107 for the past two years			1
about a month ago , however , @entity3 officials agreed to allow mr @entity97 to return so he could help negotiate the release of the captive girls			2
he initially feared he might face arrest , but was then given a letter of indemnity signed by the president when he flew to @entity3			0
along with a trusted cleric he embarked on a dangerous trek into the bush to track down the militant group and was able to meet with a senior assistant of @entity120 , @entity5 's leader			0
' the government said to the intermediary to prove himself to show whether he was capable of brokering a deal or not , and insisted that he should obtain proof of life of the hostages , ' the source said			0
' so during his talks with the insurgents , he obtained a dvd which had clips of girls being interviewed by members of the group , in which they asked president @entity11 to do a prisoner swap to get them freed			0
' off the back of the video , a deal was struck to release 50 of the girls in exchange for an equal number of @entity5 prisoners for last monday			2
but the government backed out at the last minute			0
the source pointed out that the weekend before the planned swap mr @entity11 met with @entity149 and @entity150 officials at a crisis summit in @entity152 , which was also attended by the governments of @entity154 , @entity24 and @entity155			2
he may have been afraid that if he had gone through with the deal he would have lost the support of the @entity159 , the source said			0
talks with @entity5 subsequently broke down and mr @entity97 returned to @entity107 , it is claimed			0
@entity5 leader @entity120 offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners , which was declined by the @entity3 government the new account of the behind the scenes negotiations between @entity5 and the @entity3 government comes as militants attacked a military base and police barracks , killing 24 police and soldiers			1
the attack occurred not far from where the @entity18 insurgents shot or burned to death 59 pupils at a boarding school in february , @entity175 reported			0
meanwhile a spokesman for @entity24 's defence ministry announced that a 1,000 soldiers backed up with armoured vehicles had been sent to its border with @entity3 , to counter a rising threat from @entity5			1
' their mission will be to carry out reconnaissance and be ready to respond with enough fire power , ' lieutenant colonel @entity188 told @entity175 by telephone from @entity194			0
@entity5 , which outraged international opinion with the mass abduction of schoolgirls from their boarding school in @entity199 , in @entity3 's @entity99 , has also carried out attacks in northern @entity24			2
it is suspected of attacking a @entity203 workers camp there this month .			0
