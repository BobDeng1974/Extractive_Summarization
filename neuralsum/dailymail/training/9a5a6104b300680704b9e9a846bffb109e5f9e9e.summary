cricketer @entity0 has recently been raving about a hair transplant after having the treatment to revive his thinning locks			1
but one man bitterly regrets the day he decided to fork out on the cosmetic surgery			0
@entity6 , 50 , a self - employed glazier from @entity8 , was one of the unlucky 10 per cent for whom a hair transplant simply does n't take - and he was instead left with a unsightly scar that stretched across the back of his head			1
he said : ' i had the transplant and three years later i did n't look any different to before			2
i regret having it done in the first place , i would n't recommend it to anybody			0
bald truth : @entity6 paid for a hair transplant after losing his locks but it was successful ' i ended up worse than when i started			1
i had spent the money , and i have been disfigured , and the top of my head is still the same			0
' @entity6 said the scar made him feel so self - conscious he would only go out in public wearing a cap - which he learnt was n't practical on windy days			1
' once it blew off and i had to chase it down the street , ' he said			0
he added : ' some people will point the scar out , other people will be quiet but i 'll know they 've noticed it			0
they say " what 's that at the back of your head ? " he was left with scarring on the back of his head that made him feel self - conscious , left , but a new treatment has made it less visible			1
right ' when i tell them it was a hair transplant they say , " well that 's a waste of money "			1
' in an attempt to hide the scar , @entity6 took an extreme measure			2
' if i have to go out without my cap on , i get a pencil and shade the scar in			2
then from a distance it does n't look too bad , ' he said			0
the glazier had visited other hair specialists who recommended he wore wig but @entity6 did n't feel comfortable with that and hated the idea of having a comb - over			1
new look : @entity6 has had his head tattooed so he looks like he has shaven hair			1
he said it was painful but worth it then he appeared on @entity66 show @entity67 who recommended another course of action - tattoos			0
the treatment involves individual pigmentation to give the illusion of a shaved head			2
as it is a tattoo , there is no fear of hair loss again and in @entity6 's case , it conceals his scar			1
while the treatment was painful , @entity6 showed off the results on the show and said he was delighted with his new look			2
he said : ' the scar blends in , you really have to look for it now so no one notices it			0
the treatment was painful at time but definitely worth it			0
i 've thrown that pencil away , no more shading in the mirror ! @entity67 is on @entity95 at 8pm			0

hair transplant did n't work for @entity6 , 50
he was left with large scar across the back of his head
felt so self - conscious about it he would *colour* it in with pencil
found *salvation* in new tattoo treatment
