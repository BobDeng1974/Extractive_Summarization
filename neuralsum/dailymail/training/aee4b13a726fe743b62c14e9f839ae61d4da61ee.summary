men and women across the world are living six years longer than they did a generation ago			0
a major new analysis - the @entity5 - today revealed men are living 5.8 years longer than they did in 1990 , while women are living an extra 6.6 years			0
falling death rates from cancer ( by 15 per cent ) and heart disease ( down 22 per cent ) in high - income regions have fuelled the rising life expectancy in these parts of the world			1
meanwhile in lower - income countries , rapidly falling death rates for diarrhoea , lower respiratory tract infections ( conditions that affect the lungs , such as pneumonia ) and neonatal disorders have helped prolong life expectancy			1
men are living 5.8 years longer than they did in 1990 , while women are living an extra 6.6 years			0
falling death rates from cancer and heart disease in high - income regions have fuelled the rising life expectancy in these parts of the world			1
meanwhile in lower - income countries , rapidly falling death rates for diarrhoea , lower respiratory tract infections , and neonatal disorders have helped prolong life expectancy but as life expectancies are increasing throughout the world , there is one notable exception			1
in southern @entity43 deaths from @entity44 and @entity45 have wiped more than five years off life expectancy			1
while worldwide deaths from hiv / aids have declined substantially every year since its peak in 2005 , the conditions are still the greatest cause of premature death in 20 of 48 countries in @entity43 , the study found			2
the top ten leading causes of premature death worldwide have hardly changed since 1990			0
nine causes remained in the top ten in 2013 , with hiv / aids moving in and tuberculosis moving to 11th			0
worldwide , since 1990 , years of life lost due to hiv / aids have increased by 344 per cent , drug disorders by 119 per cent , chronic kidney disease by 90 per cent , and alzheimer 's disease by 89 per cent			1
and the study , reported in @entity67 medical journal , cites war as being the leading cause of premature death in @entity70 , where an estimated 30,000 people died in 2013			0
a further 30,000 were killed in the preceding two years			0
in high - income regions , life expectancy had mostly been increased by falling cancer and heart disease death rates , said the report			1
there have also been dramatic increases in life expectancy in some low - income countries , experts found			2
in @entity90 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , the @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , life expectancy increased by more than 12 years in the last two decades			2
certain causes of death were shown to have increased around the world since 1990			2
they included liver cancer , drug use conditions , chronic kidney disease , sickle cell disease , diabetes and pancreatic cancer , the study in @entity67 medical journal found			1
despite dramatic drops in child deaths over the last 23 years ( from 7.6 million in 1990 to 3.7 million in 2013 ) , lower respiratory tract infections , malaria , and diarrhoeal disease are still in the top five global causes of death in children younger than five years			2
they continue to kill almost two million children between the ages of one and five every year			0
the global years of life lost to various illnesses ( @entity114 represents the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) global deaths by age and region in 1990 and 2013			1
in southern @entity43 , deaths from @entity44 and @entity45 have wiped more than five years off life expectancy men in the @entity123 increased their life expectancy by the average , rising from 72.9 to 79.1 years between 1990 and 2013			1
but @entity123 women saw only a 4.4 - year increase from 78.4 to 82.8 years			0
in eastern @entity130 , half of all premature deaths in 2013 were due to five causes : heart disease , stroke , self harm , cirrhosis , and road injury			1
meanwhile half of the word 's suicide deaths occurring in @entity139 and @entity140 alone			0
in @entity139 , life expectancy at birth increased from 57.3 years to 64.2 years for men between 1990 and 2013 and 58.2 years to 68.5 years for women during the same time period			1
@entity139 has made remarkable progress in reducing child and adult deaths with death rates dropping 1.3 per cent per year for adults and 3.7 per cent for children			0
road injury and interpersonal violence - violence between people who know each other - are key contributors to premature deaths in @entity158 and the @entity159 , ranking in the top five leading causes for 17 and 15 out of 29 countries in the region , respectively			2
outside this region , interpersonal violence only ranks in the top five causes in just one other country in the world : @entity167			0
lead author dr @entity168 , professor of global health at the @entity170 , @entity171 , said : ' the progress we are seeing against a variety of illnesses and injuries is good , even remarkable , but we can and must do even better			0
' the huge increase in collective action and funding given to the major infectious diseases such as diarrhoea , measles , tuberculosis , @entity45 , and malaria has had a real impact			0
' however , this study shows that some major chronic diseases have been largely neglected but are rising in importance , particularly drug disorders , liver cirrhosis , diabetes , and chronic kidney disease			1

life expectancy has risen by falling deaths from cancer ( down by 15 **%** ) and heart disease ( 22 **%** ) , global study shows
but certain causes of death have increased since 1990 : drug use conditions , diabetes and pancreatic cancer
