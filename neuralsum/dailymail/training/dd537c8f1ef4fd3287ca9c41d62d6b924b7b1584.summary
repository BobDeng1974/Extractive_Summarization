now he says that the country is under attack from @entity1			2
' i do n't hate @entity1 , ' he said			0
' that 's my home			0
that 's where i grew up			0
i do n't have a need to hate @entity1 itself			0
but the government and their policies as far as the @entity43 lands , that 's another story			0
' his home was recently hit in @entity1 airstrikes in @entity2			2
the @entity1 government says the strikes targeted terrorists planning to attack @entity1 - but @entity15 said any attack would be a reaction to the @entity1 interview : he spoke with @entity9 ' @entity57 and told her the @entity43 world experiences 9/11s every day militant : he joined rebel group @entity32 two years ago but says he does not hate @entity1 ' i would n't consider it a terrorist attack , ' he said			1

' there 's no tears being shed from me if something happened in @entity1 , ' he said			1

' he added that he himself would not take part in an attack on @entity1 - not because he would not want to , but because the @entity1 authorities are watching him			2
he told @entity9 that authorities know he is fighting in @entity2 and have visited his family in the @entity12			1
as a result , he is not allowed to travel anywhere that would require using his passport			0

' terrorism ' : a photograph taken from @entity93 on thursday shows smoke rising following @entity1 - led airstrikes in @entity96 , @entity2			1
@entity15 says the attacks will cause militants to react and attack the @entity1 battle : another @entity101 - born militant , @entity100 , who was previously with the @entity102 , previously spoke to @entity9 about moving to @entity2 when seeing how @entity2 were being killed by president @entity104 's regime former life : @entity100 , pictured when he was in the @entity102 , left @entity106 two years ago for @entity2 so he could fight for fellow @entity107			1
he said @entity109 's brutality comes nowhere close to that of @entity104 's regime @entity111 traveled undercover to @entity2 to interview @entity15 and another @entity112 - a former @entity102 fighter known as @entity100 - battling against the @entity1 while both men oppose the @entity1 , they are not members of the @entity26 state			1
@entity111 told the @entity117 she would not have traveled into @entity2 to meet with members of that group			0
she has been to @entity2 11 times since the civil war began there , but this was the first time she has gone since @entity26 state rebels beheaded two @entity1 journalists and two @entity126 aid workers			1
' i felt comfortable and secure , ' @entity111 said			0

' @entity111 said she had several discussions with @entity100 online and talked in person with people who said they knew him			0
