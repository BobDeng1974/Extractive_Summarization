by @entity0 if you punch a punk or kick a metaller in @entity4 , you could soon be hauled before the courts and charged with a hate crime			2
@entity7 is set to become the first force in @entity9 to recognise attacks on members of alternative subcultures			1
so now assaults on goths , emos , punks and heavy metal fans and other minority groups will be officially labelled as hate crimes			0
the force will record such incidents as hate crimes in much the same way it officially recognises attacks on people due to race , religion , disability , sexual orientation or transgender identity			0
@entity37 was a goth who had upwards of 20 piercings in her face , lip and nose and liked alternative music stars like @entity50			1
she and her boyfriend , @entity37 , 21 , were set upon without provocation as they walked through a park in @entity54 , @entity55 in 2007			1
a gang of youths , drunk on cider , lager and peach schnapps , kicked mr @entity61 unconscious before two of them turned on @entity37			1
will classifying them as hate crimes reduce the number of attacks on goths ? the student , who was due to start an @entity71 degree at university a month later , was attacked as she cradled her boyfriend 's head in her lap. she suffered horrendous head injuries and was rushed to hospital where a photo was taken of her battered and bruised face which became a symbol of ‘ @entity9			0
’ afterwards the gang celebrated their attack on the goth — or ‘ moshers ’ - by telling friends : ‘ there ’s two moshers nearly dead up @entity54 park - you wan na see them - they 're a right mess			1
’ @entity37 survived for 13 days in intensive care before her family made the heartbreaking decision to have her life support machine turned off			2
@entity7 will be the first police force in the @entity97 to recognise alternative sub-culture such as @entity99 and @entity100			2
the move follows the brutal death of goth student @entity37 @entity37 's boyfriend @entity104 was also brutally attacked in the park			1
now the @entity7 will seek to protect those who are part of an ' alternative sub-culture ' her killers , @entity37 , 16 , who admitted murder , received a 16 - year minimum term while @entity113 , who was convicted after a trial , was given a minimum of 18 years			1
three other boys from the area admitted beating mr @entity61 , 21 – brothers @entity118 and @entity120 , 16 and 17 , and @entity121 , also 17			0
they were jailed for between four and six years			0
in the wake of her death , @entity37 ’s mother , @entity122 , set up the @entity125 which dedicates itself to wiping out intolerance and prejudice in all walks of life			1
@entity130 , assistant chief constable in @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , said : ‘ @entity37 ’s tragic death brought forward a need to recognise that there are many other victims of hate crime that should be protected by law			1
murderers : @entity139 , left , and @entity113 , right , led a gang of teenagers who beat 20 - year - old @entity37 to death because she was dressed as a goth ‘ while we have worked with the foundation for some time , i am proud to say we are now the first force in the country to officially record alternative subculture as a sixth strand of hate crime motivation			1
‘ hate crime ruins many people ’s lives and in some cases can tragically cost lives			0
we work with many organisations to raise the awareness of what hate crime is and how victims can be supported and we will continue to encourage our communities to challenge it , report it and help us to stop it			0
’ @entity163 , founder of the @entity125 and @entity37 ’s mum , said : ‘ it is a very proud day for me personally and the rest of the team			2
‘ it is a validation of the work we have undertaken in the past five years and hopefully other forces will follow @entity7 ’s lead			2
’ mr @entity130 added : ‘ the launch of this new strand of recordable hate crime is a major breakthrough			0
we are able to officially recognise that people who wish to express their alternative sub-culture identity freely should not have to tolerate hate crime – something that many people have to endure on a daily basis			0
’ @entity7 said it recognises alternative subculture as a broad term to define a strong sense of collective identity , values and tastes			2
distinctive style , clothing , make - up , body art and music preference will fall under an ‘ alternative umbrella ’ and will include goths , emos , punks and metallers - though it could also include other groups			0
the @entity125 works with police forces and politicians to ensure individuals who are part of sub-cultures are protected by the law .			0

@entity7 becomes first in country to adopt new policy
follows @entity37 murder - student beaten to death for being a goth
but courts will not be able to *impose* harsher sentences unless law changes
