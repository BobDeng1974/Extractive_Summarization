by @entity1 reporter they are among thousands of endangered sea turtles who journey to the shore each year			1
the @entity8 turtles arrive at the beach just a few days before each new moon to form one of the biggest arribadas - mass synchronised nesting			1
as they arrive on land off the coast of @entity17 , their large fins propel them forward and dig into the sand to decorate the beach with gentle waves			1
professional wildlife photographer @entity31 , spent 20 days in @entity17 to capture this magnificent sight			0
the 45 - year - old said : ' this is one of the most spectacular nature events that you can witness in the world			2
' nowhere else can you see such an enormous arribada			0
' each turtle lays around 80 to 100 soft - shell eggs in a shallow nest in the sand , before heading back to the ocean			2

for the first two days of the arribada , the locals collect eggs which would otherwise be destroyed by the late arrivals which journey across the beach			2
they then dedicate hours both night and day to clean the beach from driftwood and guard the turtles and their nests			1
@entity31 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , said : ' i met the locals and they absolutely love the turtles			2
' they work around the clock to protect them and i found that i could get quite close to the turtles as they are used to having people there			0
' their only concern is laying the eggs			0

' so if you move very slowly , they think you are a drifting trunk and come close to rub their skin against you ! ' although over 10 million eggs are laid during each cycle , only a fraction of these will hatch			0
and despite the best efforts of the locals , even fewer hatchlings will make it to the ocean			0
yet with turtles arriving on @entity87 beach all year round , the legacy of the turtles is set to @entity107 said : ' i was speechless when i saw the turtles first arriving - i could not believe it			1
' i have seen many spectacles of nature in my career around the world but this one was very unique			0
' i could not believe that this huge arribadas still happens today			0
