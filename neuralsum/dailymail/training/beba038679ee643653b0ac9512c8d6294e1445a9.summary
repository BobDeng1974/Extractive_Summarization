mocking the accents of visitors from @entity2 and shouting at @entity4 tourists is the kind of service you might only expect from the terminally tactless @entity8			1
but now tourism chiefs think @entity11 ’s real - life hoteliers need to be taught how to avoid making such gaffes with foreign guests			1
@entity14 , the taxpayer - funded body that promotes the @entity11 overseas , has devised a list of dos and don’ts for the tourist industry			1
out of step : @entity8 , played by @entity21 , could n't stop himself goose - stepping and referencing the @entity22 when he had @entity24 guests some - such as the warning not to poke fun at @entity2 accents – border on the blindingly obvious			1
others are downright bizarre , with tour operators instructed to avoid putting people from @entity32 in historic houses or four - poster beds because they are superstitious and may fear ‘ a ghostly encounter ’			0
@entity14 , which receives almost £ 30 million of government funding annually , included the advice in research it produces for the tourist industry			1
yet , despite their efforts to promote cross-cultural understanding , the quango ’s own use of generalisations , such as ‘ demanding ’ @entity24 and ‘ sarcastic ’ @entity43 , could be interpreted as offensive			0
evoking the famous 1975 episode of @entity49 comedy @entity48 , in which a goose - stepping @entity8 repeatedly references the @entity22 in front of @entity24 visitors , several of the tips relate to acceptable topics of conversation			0
the guidance says @entity58 visitors will not tolerate discussions about money , while @entity61 dislike any attempt to talk about their country ’s politics or language divisions			0
@entity66 : the logo of @entity14 , which receives £ 30million from the government every year @entity14 also warns that @entity43 visitors have a tendency to be sarcastic and their jokes about ‘ @entity72 ’ are meant to be endearing			2
the advice includes tips about body language , with anyone interacting with @entity78 tourists urged to avoid excessive eye contact			1
it also states that @entity2 visitors are ‘ in the habit of shaking their heads ’ and instructs hosts to be ‘ intuitive ’ when determining whether the gesture ‘ signifies assent or objection ’			2
attitudes towards service vary significantly , the guide warns			0
@entity2 tourists are described as ‘ amiable ’ but with ‘ a tendency to change their minds ’			2
holidaymakers from @entity97 and @entity24 , meanwhile , are labelled ‘ straightforward and demanding ’ to the point of sometimes seeming ‘ rude and aggressive ’			0
but the most demanding visitors , according to the tourism agency ’s guidance , are the @entity4 , who expect their every need to be catered for - and anticipated without them saying anything			2
they also prefer ‘ nicer alternatives ’ to the word ‘ no ’			0
attitudes to accommodation are also presented as varying widely			0
@entity111 are said to be ‘ a tall nation ’ and tour operators are advised to provide rooms with high ceilings and doorways , while @entity58 visitors are said to dislike small rooms far away from the reception area			0
the advice also warns that @entity121 will be offended if they are described as ‘ @entity122 ’			0
a spokesman for @entity14 said its profiles of overseas markets were designed to ensure @entity11 ’s hotels , tour operators , visitor attractions and entertainment establishments offer the best service			1
@entity132 , marketing director at @entity14 , said : ‘ our market intelligence reports provide an unrivalled source of information on inbound tourism , allowing @entity11 businesses to gain an invaluable insight on key markets globally			1
’ tips : the advice given by @entity14 to members of the tourism industry			1
