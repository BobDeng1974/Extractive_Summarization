by @entity0 dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show @entity5 's @entity4			2
they all show a thin , curved device with distinctive white ' bars ' across the back			2
however , a @entity10 news agency has claimed that in fact , the finished product will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen			1
new rumours back the claims , promising a far thinner screen technology			2
up until august last year , @entity25 was the record - holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its @entity29 , at 0.24 inches ( 6.18 millimetres )			2
this was then replaced by the @entity31 at just 0.23 inches ( 5.75 millimetres )			0
by comparison , @entity5 ’s current @entity32 has a depth of 0.3 inches ( 7.6 millimetres ) , while the @entity35 is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches ( 7.5 millimetres )			0
@entity37 's @entity36 is 0.31 inches ( 7.9 millimetres ) thick , while the @entity38 is 0.37 inches ( 9.3 millimetres )			0
@entity39 says the leaked pictures all show flaws - such as buttons that do not fit properly , of misaligned screens			1
they claim this is because the units are unfinished - and that the final version will have polished glass in place of the bars seen in pictures , and possibly even a curved screen			1
according to an unnamed source who has seen the real thing , the mockups are no better than a ' rough estimate ' of what the final phone will look like			1
it also claims the final design could see a curved glass design			1
another report from the @entity63 says @entity5 will use a new type of display in the @entity4 , allowing it to be far thinner than the current @entity4 5c - although it claims manufacturers are struggling to make the super-thin panels			1
@entity5 suppliers are believed to be about to begin mass production of two new iphones set to be launched in september			2
it has been rumoured the 4.5 inch version of the handset would launch first , followed a month later by a 5.5inch version			2
however , now it believed both could be unveiled at the same time			2
prolific @entity5 - tipster , @entity16 , has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible @entity5 lcd backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm )			1
the photos suggest @entity5 is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5 - inch phone ' @entity5 is ramping up on two bigger devices , said @entity87 , saying its sources asked not to be identified because the plans are private			1
' one model will have a 4.7 - inch display , compared to the 4 - inch screen of the current @entity32 , that may be available to ship to retailers around september , said two of the people			1
' a 5.5 - inch version is also being prepared for manufacturing and may be available at the same time , the people said			2
' hundreds of thousands of new employees have been drafted in by suppliers to meet the expected huge demand			0
according to a new report from @entity102 , ' overall , our survey suggests that consumer demand foran @entity4 is solid			0
' the firm surveyed 4,000 + consumers , and found many would be swayed towards the @entity4 by a bigger screen			0
' 35 % of the users who do n’t expect to purchase an @entity4 would do so should @entity5 offer a larger form factor , ' it said			0
however , it did find consumer 's number one request was better battery life - followed by a bigger screen			1
it also found people would pay a premium for the big screen			0
' 26 % of the consumers are willing to pay a $ 100 premium for a 5.5 " screen size , ' the report claimed			0
according to @entity124 , a quarter of potential @entity4 6 buyers would be willing to pay $ 100 more for their @entity4 to have a 5.5 - inch screen over the other rumored size of 4.7 inches			1
@entity131 will recruit over 100,000 people in mainland @entity133 to produce the newest iphone from @entity5 , @entity130 's @entity129 reported on monday , in what the report called the firm 's largest single hiring spree in @entity133			0
fellow @entity130 contract manufacturer @entity139 will also expand its workforce in one mainland factory by 30 percent , in response to expected high demand for the new @entity4			0
the handsets have been plagued by leaks			0
while numerous images of the 4.7 - inch version have been leaked over the past few weeks , until recently details of the 5.5 inch model have remained a mystery			1
now , prolific @entity5 - tipster , @entity16 , has got his hands on images of the front and back of a possible @entity5 lcd backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches ( 14cm )			1
while the photos themselves are n’t groundbreaking , they suggest @entity5 is already producing components for the larger - sized phones , according to 9 to 5 @entity162 who first reported the leak , after @entity16 tweeted the images			1
an image last week , also leaked by @entity16 , revealed the two new models side - by - side			1
these latest photos are the first images of the 5.5 - inch version 's display part			1
@entity131 , which manufacturers around 70 per cent of the phone , recently hired 100,000 additional workers in mainland @entity133 to help produce the @entity4 6			0
both these moves suggest @entity5 is gearing up for the launch of new @entity179 devices around the usual september timeframe			0
separate reports have suggested the 5.5 - inch model will be released several weeks before the 4.7 - inch model , and will be produced in limited numbers			1
based on previous leaks , the new set of @entity186 will launch in a thinner aluminium body and will include a sapphire crystal display covering for improved strength			1
users of @entity5 's next handset may also be able to track altitude , weather and even air pressure , according to code found in the @entity198 operating system			0
larger iphones , the subject of months of speculation , would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like @entity37			0
@entity130 sources said the camera in the @entity4 will get a boost to @entity209 , from its current @entity211 version , along with a new lens offering better picture quality			0
it is also expected to boast a new filter , allowing for clearer pictures			0
@entity5 's new devices are expected to use the in - cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible			2
@entity224 blog @entity223 claims this is the rear case of the @entity4 6			0
as well as environmental readings , the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone 's location services users of @entity4 could have sensors to track altitude , weather and even air pressure , according to code hidden in the @entity198 operating system			0

if the rumours turn out to be true , the @entity4 will have a rounded , thinner design and a larger screen this concept @entity280 ( pictured ) incorporates @entity283 fitness features that leaked in march , but experts claim @entity5 could additionally be working on a separate wristband specifically designed to track health			1
