archaeologists excavating the ancient @entity7 city of @entity10 , on the site of the modern - day @entity13 capital , found the 500 - year - old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city 's @entity17			1
on such stones victims were offered up for ritual sacrifice by priests who split open their abdomen from belly to throat and then pulled out their still - beating hearts			0
gruesome : the five skulls discovered by archaeologists beneath a sacrificial stone which have been pierced on the sides to be hung on a rack known as a tzompantli and displayed outside a temple the find the largest cache of skulls yet discovered at the site and archaeologists say they were likely used in rituals associated with @entity39 , the @entity7 god of death			1
forty - five of the skulls were discovered above the stone , and a further five , more - fragmented specimens were found below which had holes in both sides , suggesting they were once hung on a skull rack			1
such racks , known as tzompantlis , were used to display the crania of sacrificed people near temples and other important locations			0
other skulls had been modified in a way that suggested they were to be made into masks , but never completed			1
brutal : a total os 50 skulls and 250 jaw bones were discovered as archaeologists excavated the old city of @entity10 , on the site of modern day @entity4 offering : archaeologists say the skulls were probably buried there during a period of building and renovation as a tribute to @entity39 , the @entity7 god of death rituals : some of the skulls had been modified in a way that suggested they were to be made into masks , but never completed archaeologist @entity80 , head of the @entity81 of @entity4 's @entity82 ( @entity82 ) , suggested the skulls were deposited in various offerings			1
' the skulls were used by the ancient @entity7 as elements of consecration or closing of architectural spaces and rituals associated with the worship of @entity39 , god of death , so perhaps it is a gift that served to close any prehispanic building , ' he said			1
' some of the 45 skulls that were above the sacrificial stone , have been manipulated with the intention to prepare " skull - masks " that were never finished , ' he added			1
these kinds of masks , common among the @entity7 , were representations of death @entity39 , archaeologist @entity100 said			1
finished versions would be adorned with green stone to simulate the eyes and accompanied with spiral necklaces , rattles and obsidian knives			0
the five skulls with holes are believed to have been buried between 1375 and 1427 and archaeologists consider them an offering of consecration to sacrificial stone they lay beneath some 250 jaw bones were also found in the usual procedure of the ritual , sacrificial victims would be taken to the top of the temple where four priests would lay them down on a stone slab			1
the victim 's abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest using a ceremonial flint knife to cut right through the diaphragm and split open the chest			0
the priest would grab the heart and tear it out , still beating			0
it would then be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honoured god , and the body thrown down the temple 's stairs landing at a terrace at the base of the pyramid			2
for the re-consecration of @entity144 of @entity10 in 1487 , the @entity7 reported that they sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days			2
historians believe that figure may be an exaggeration			0
the 45 skulls above the sacrificial stone were discovered in mid-august as workers carried out infrastructure work to create a lobby for the @entity156 and @entity157			0
@entity4 was once the site of @entity159 , the capital of the @entity7 civilisation which dominated much of @entity161 from the 14th to @entity162			2
the @entity7 were finally vanquished in 1521 by @entity164 conquistadores led by @entity165 , who were helped by a number of indigenous allies , perhaps uncomfortable with the constant human sacrifices , to overrun @entity10			2
@entity7 culture is these days primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as @entity172 in @entity4 ; indigenous bark paper codices ; and eyewitness accounts of @entity164 invaders			2
according to mr @entity80 , most of the skulls are from women and men who were between 20 and 35 years old when they died			0
they may have been dug up from other burial sites and reburied there , he added			0
he believes they were buried sometime between 1440 and 1469 as work was going on to build a new temple at the site			0
' the skulls were found in good condition , as moisture conditions facilitated their preservation , but were fragmented by the weight of the floors and filled with earth above them , a good portion of them are complete , ' said archaeologist @entity197 , who added that there may be attempts to restore them			0
the five skulls with holes are believed to have been buried earlier - between 1375 and 1427 - and archaeologists consider them an offering of consecration to sacrificial stone they lay beneath .			2

*experts* believe they are an offering to @entity7 death god @entity39
five are pierced on the sides , suggesting they were hung on a rack
other skulls bear signs of being made into masks but not completed
