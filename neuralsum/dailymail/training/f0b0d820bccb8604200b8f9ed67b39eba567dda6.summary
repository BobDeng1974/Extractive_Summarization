he was the accidental hero who stumbled upon an @entity1 and @entity2			1
at least , that was @entity5 ’s take on @entity6 – the trophy - prone fool			1
for when @entity6 triumphantly mounted the steps of the @entity15 , fists clenched , smile as wide as the @entity2 trophy itself and screamed to his paymaster ‘ i ’ve done it ’ , the @entity12 returned a despairing look of ‘ yes , you have , i ’m going to have to make you manager now , are n’t i ? ’			1
@entity6 lifts the @entity2 trophy after @entity23 's triumph in 2012 the former @entity23 manager is given the bumps by his players after winning the @entity1 in 2012 how dare the caretaker extend his remit to writing history with @entity23 ’s first @entity2			1
how dare he back his owner into a corner			0
his temerity was begrudgingly rewarded with a two - year deal			0
within five months he was sacked			0
the accidental hero was now @entity5 ’s intentional fall guy			2
@entity6 – save for the odd charming performance as a pundit – has not been seen since			2
back in management with @entity40 , footballing fate has it that he will face his former club next month			2
@entity6 forged a special bind with the @entity23 players after a difficult spell under @entity47 @entity23 fans were left angry after @entity6 was replaced by @entity49 at the end of 2012 it will be two years and four days since his inevitable @entity23 axe when the @entity53 travel to @entity54 in their penultimate @entity2 group fixture			1
for the away fans , it will be a chance to say a belated thank you and goodbye , rather than hello			0
it was @entity49 who replaced @entity6 at @entity60 and , throughout the former @entity64 boss ’s reign , @entity23 supporters sang the name of their fallen favourite in the 16th minute of matches in recognition of the shirt number he wore during six years as a player			1
the irony is , without @entity6 ’s contribution during those six years – he was integral to maxing @entity23 ‘ sexy ’ again – @entity5 may well have invested his roubles elsewhere			1
the @entity75 also helped his side to knock @entity77 out of the 2012 @entity2 @entity6 acted as @entity47 ' understudy until the manager was sacked in 2012 video @entity6 perfect fit for @entity40 - @entity81 there were six trophies – two @entity84 , a @entity85 , a @entity86 , a @entity87 and a @entity88 – during his time in @entity90 , that silverware rebranding a club which had not won a domestic prize since the @entity1 of 1970			1
to that end , @entity6 ’s goal after just 42 seconds of the 1997 final against @entity96 heralded a new era			2
and what of that strike ? a run from deep climaxed by a 30 - yard blast which cannoned into the back of the net via the underside of the crossbar – it was a stunning reintroduction to the big stage			0
@entity6 heads @entity23 's @entity1 final winning goal against @entity109 in 2000 @entity6 was also part of a successful @entity23 team as a player , winning the @entity1 in 1997 and 2000 the former @entity53 midfielder hammers @entity23 into the lead just 42 seconds into the 1997 @entity1 final @entity6 celebrates his early strike during the @entity1 final against @entity96 his icon was etched in that one moment , his legend later cemented by two more @entity122 goals			1
the first came in the @entity86 victory , again over @entity96 , in the following season			0
then , in 2000 and the last final beneath the old @entity125 , @entity6 scored the winner against @entity109			0
a leg injury would curtail his career at just 31 but he returned to lead out @entity23 ahead of the 2002 @entity1 final with @entity130 , a gesture in ‘ gratitude for the midfielder 's contribution to the transformation of the club ’			1
gratitude , however , was in short supply a decade on			0
@entity6 is not the vindictive type to view next month ’s meeting as an opportunity for payback or revenge			0
rather , he will accept the gratitude of the @entity23 fans with dignity			0
and you would n’t be surprised if his players on the pitch did the talking for him			0
@entity6 ( left ) , @entity150 and @entity151 celebrate the 1997 @entity1 win			2

@entity6 has been appointed as the new @entity40 manager
@entity6 won the @entity1 and @entity2 as @entity23 's caretaker manager in 2012
the @entity75 *enjoyed* a successful career as a @entity23 player , scoring in two @entity1 finals for the club
@entity5 replaced @entity6 with @entity49 after a poor run of results in 2012
