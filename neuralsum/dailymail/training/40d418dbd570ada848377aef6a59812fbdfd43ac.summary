by @entity0 for @entity1 and @entity2 former footy star senator @entity3 has claimed politics is ' tougher ' than anything he faced on the field			1
the rugby league great and one of the @entity10 's star recruits has revealed he is feeling the pressure after being elected to the @entity12 in the 2013 federal election			1
the 48 - year - old told @entity15 : ' i am very confident in my ability as a footballer , so i would have to say playing state of origin and playing rugby league certainly came a lot easier to me pressure wise , i think politics would take that hands down			1
' responding to the recent criticism he faced after it was revealed he had ripped off information from @entity28 to inform followers about his state of @entity31 , he said : ' if that is a real crime , then i am guilty			0
' i 've had some pretty violent and a huge footballers try to rip my head off and i think i am big enough and ugly enough to handle the criticism , but that sort of does n't sit well with me when my mother rings , or mother - in - law rings or someone like that to see how i am because of some very negative press , ' he told the radio show			1
local media reports suggests the new senator has been sidestepping questions about his party leader 's controversial comments about @entity65			2
the @entity66 in @entity31 reports that senator @entity3 has refused to respond to questions about @entity70 ’s economic future , what his plans for the state were and the comments made by party leader @entity75 and fellow senator @entity76			1
as a senator , @entity3 , enjoys a base salary of more than $ 195,000 plus a raft of entitlements including travel			1
it 's been a tough initiation for one - time football great , heckled during his maiden speech , accused of going to ground by sections of the media and now this			2
also on senator @entity3 's website , the words used to describe the role of the @entity12 and a member 's role in it strike a remarkably close resemblance to the details provided on the site of @entity70 's @entity67 , @entity97			1
@entity75 ( right ) and senator @entity76 have recently been embroiled in the war of words of @entity70 's relationship with @entity65 and now @entity12 leader @entity3 is in hot water the following are the second and third paragraphs on senator @entity3 ' website : ' @entity31 is the largest state and the third most populated with a population of some 4,560,059 people			1
the capital and largest city in the state is @entity109 , @entity70 ’s third largest city			2
referred to as the ‘ @entity31 ’ , @entity31 is home to 10 of @entity70 ’s 30 largest cities and is the nation ’s third largest economy			2
the state was named in honour of @entity116 , who on 6 june 1859 signed @entity117 separating the colony from @entity119			0
the date 6 june is now celebrated state - wide as @entity121			2
queen @entity116 , who went on to become @entity123 ’s longest reigning monarch , chose an eponymous name for the colony over @entity126 , which had been suggested by the influential local presbyterian minister @entity127 in honour of navigator @entity129			0
@entity31 achieved statehood with the @entity131 on 1 january 1901			0
' @entity10 senators @entity76 ( left ) and @entity3 are making headlines for the wrong reasons before entering politics in 2013 with the @entity10 , @entity3 ( pictured playing for @entity119 against @entity31 ) enjoyed a stellar rugby league career , considered one of the code 's greatest players and the following are excerpts from @entity31 - @entity28 : ' @entity31 ( abbreviated as @entity31 ) is the second - largest and third-most populous state in @entity70			1
' @entity31 has a population of 4,560,059 , concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state 's @entity144			0
' the capital and largest city in the state is @entity109 , @entity70 's third largest city			1

' apart from some re-ordering of sentences , there appears to be very little differentiation between the two pages			0
reading further , there are arguably too many similarities to be a coincidence			0
as the @entity28 site appears today the words on the @entity31 page of the @entity3 site @entity45 strikes a remarkable resemblance to those on @entity28 ( top ) senator @entity3 seems to be not backing down after the first real test of his political career , unlike his former football team - mate @entity182			1
@entity182 , another rugby league great who starred for the @entity186 side , is remembered for perhaps the country 's most short - lived of political careers			1
in september 2001 , just a few days after deciding he would run as an @entity189 in the @entity191 elections , he pulled out of the race while in his first political interview , saying quite simply : ' i 'm buggered , i 'm sorry			0
i have to resign ' .			0

@entity3 has spoken out about the pressure he faces as a politician
he entered politics just last year to head @entity10 's @entity12 ticket and was *voted* in on less than 10 *%* primary *votes*
@entity3 won rugby league *premierships* with three different clubs - @entity186 , @entity109 and @entity205
