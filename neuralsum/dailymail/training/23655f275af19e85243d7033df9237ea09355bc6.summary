even though we are just a few days into fall , the traditional colours of autumn are already visible from space			1
@entity4 today revealed these stunning images from its @entity7 satellite capturing fall colors around the @entity9 and @entity10			1
the brown and orange shades are most pronounced in the @entity13 , northern @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and southern @entity19 and @entity20			2
the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) on @entity4 ? s @entity7 satellite captured this view of fall colors around the @entity9 on sept. 26 , 2014			1
the changing of leaf color in temperate forests involves several causes and reactions , but the dominant factors are sunlight and heat			1
as explained by the @entity34 , certain species of trees produce certain colors			1
oaks generally turn red , brown , or russet ; hickories become golden bronze ; aspen and yellow - poplar turn golden			2
red maple turns brilliant scarlet ; sugar maple , orange - red ; and black maple , yellow			2
leaves of some trees , such as elms , simply become brown			0
the changing of leaf color in temperate forests involves several causes and reactions , but the dominant factors are sunlight and heat			1
since temperatures tend to drop sooner and sunlight fades faster at higher latitudes , the progression of fall color changes tends to move from north to south across @entity62 from mid-september through mid-november			1
in late summer and autumn , tree and plant leaves produce less chlorophyll , the green pigment that harvests sunlight for plants to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars			0
the subsidence of chlorophyll allows other chemical compounds in the leaves — particularly carotenoids and flavonoids — to emerge from the green shadow of summer			0
the brown and orange shades are most pronounced in the @entity13 , northern @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and southern @entity19 and @entity20			0
you can also see faint traces of phytoplankton blooms in the lakes and offshore in the @entity84			0
@entity4 launched the @entity86 's flagship satellite ' @entity7 , ' named for @entity87 , on december 18 , 1999			1
@entity7 has been collecting data about @entity87 's changing climate			1
@entity7 carries five state - of - the - art sensors that have been studying the interactions among the @entity87 's atmosphere , lands , oceans , and radiant energy			1
each sensor has unique design features that will enable scientists to meet a wide range of science objectives			0
these compounds do not decay as fast as chlorophyll , so they shine through in yellows , oranges , and reds as the green fades			0
another set of chemicals , anthocyanins , are associated with the storage of sugars and give the leaves of some species deep purple and red hues			2
as explained by the @entity34 , certain species of trees produce certain colors			1
oaks generally turn red , brown , or russet ; hickories become golden bronze ; aspen and yellow - poplar turn golden			0
red maple turns brilliant scarlet ; sugar maple , orange - red ; and black maple , yellow			0
leaves of some trees , such as elms , simply become brown			0
weather affects the range and intensity of colors			2
if the weather stays above freezing , it is easier for anthocyanins to form			0
dry weather , which increases the sugar concentration in sap , also increases the amount of anthocyanin			0
so the brightest autumn colors occur when dry , sunny days are followed by cool , dry nights			2
according to a paper published last month by researchers from @entity155 , climate change could someday delay the onset of fall color changes in some species , but also extend it later into the year			1
warmer temperatures could lengthen the growing season for some plants , though moreso at middle latitudes than high latitudes .			0
