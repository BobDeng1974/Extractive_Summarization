by @entity0 published : 02:37 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 07:15 est , 16 october 2013 last year , the @entity2 ladies rowing team made headlines when their nude charity calendar became the target of criticism from feminist bloggers			1
but despite the blogger 's best efforts , the fundraiser proved a success and resulted in more than £ 600 being donated to @entity12			2
now , the @entity2 girls are back with a new calendar and say they wo n't be told when and where to show off their bodies by feminists			1
unabashed : @entity18 ( centre ) and her fellow rowers have n't been put off by the backlash as these images reveal ' in our opinion , the feminists who criticised our calendar for hampering the feminist cause are contradicting their own argument. , ' explained students @entity29 , @entity31 and @entity32 - all of whom appear in the new calendar			1
' surely what feminists are seeking to achieve is equality for men and women - be it in jobs , pay , opportunities or the impression that society has of them			2
' as the men of our club have produced a successful [ naked ] calendar for the past four years , we are more than entitled to do the same thing			2
' they added : ' as politics students all three of us would consider ourselves feminists , any woman who wants equality would , but we do n't think that we are hampering the cause - in fact we think we are furthering it			0
' in a blog post for the @entity60 , @entity56 , who describes herself as a commentator on feminist issues , described the initiative as ' tacky ' and insisted that the girls were ' victims in the liberation game '			0
charity : like the 2013 effort , proceeds from this year 's calendar will go to support @entity12 backlash : last year 's calendar caused controversy after it was criticised by feminist blogger @entity56 ' groups of women posing semi-naked on a field with sticks does n't sound a fundraising initiative for charity , it just sounds tacky , ' she wrote			1
' although many argue that it is purely for fundraising purposes , in my own university sports team , the majority of women who participated were not made aware and did not even seek to find out which charities were being helped			0
' rather , they just view it as an opportunity to strip and attempt to gain notoriety with friends and family both back home and on campus			0
' as opposed to being liberated by posing semi-naked , they are in fact just helping women to be perpetually viewed as sex objects , something to be " bought " , " sold " and then tossed away once the @entity96 period is over			0
' but the @entity2 rowers , far from being put off by the backlash , insist that @entity56 was wrong to criticise them and say they received overwhelming support from the general public			1
' the controversy last year was a shame considering it was all intended for a good cause , ' explains @entity18			0
' ultimately , we received an overwhelming amount of support with many people sending in emails thanking us for supporting such a great charity and sharing stories with us about how @entity12 had benefited them			0
' support : the girls raised more than £ 600 for their chosen charity last year and received many kind messages high hopes : the girls hope this year 's effort will raise more money and that interest will focus on the cause like last year 's effort , the 2014 calendar comes in tasteful black and white and features the girls posing in a variety of rowing - related scenes , including wandering out of the boat shed and standing next to a wooden pier with life jackets to cover their modesty			1
and like its predecessor , proceeds from the £ 7.99 calendar will also be used to help fund the work of @entity12 - something that @entity18 hopes attention will focus on this year			2
' this year 's calendar is more to do with raising awareness of the amazing work that @entity12 does and helping them to help more people , ' she pleads			1
' this is something which should n't be detracted from by a political debate over the feminist cause			0

the @entity2 rowing club 's new calendar will help a *cancer* charity
last year 's calendar hit the headlines after criticism from feminist bloggers
rowers say they hope attention will be on the cause and not the feminists
