by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 19:28 est , 14 july 2013 question : i finally have got round to reading @entity3			1
my husband saw me and to my surprise ( and horror ) started dropping hints that he 'd like to try some of the things in the book			1
for me , such fantasies should remain in the mind			2
how do i tell him without seeming like a spoilsport ? black and white answer : despite @entity3 's popularity , most of its female fans are n't desperate for bondage ; women often are n't taken in by sex ' trends ' answer : i sometimes worry that the furore around @entity3 and racy reads like it has made many over-excited partners forget the boundaries between fact and fantasy			1
when i was young , every woman was reading @entity31 's lace books , but no one thought we all longed to be soft porn stars like the heroine @entity35			2
nor did anyone suspect the vast global readership of @entity39 's @entity38 was actually panting after @entity41 priests			2
so why does everyone think the popularity of @entity3 means its female fans are all desperate for light bondage ? most women know their own erotic tastes and are n't taken in by ' trends '			1
there 's nothing new about @entity50 ( just ask the @entity51 ) and most of us decided it was n't our cup of tea decades ago			1
the funny thing is that bondage is n't @entity3 's heroine @entity3 's peccadillo either - she just complies for her lover @entity3			1
so far , so old fashioned			0
my sense of things is that the truly aphrodisiacal quality of billionaire @entity3 is not his penchant for inflicting pain , but his money , power , helicopter and boyish good looks			1
take all that away and no woman i know would acquiesce to his games			0
so i do n't think for a second you 're a ' spoilsport ' for not wanting to go along with your husband 's desires			1
while some people welcome the chance to be submissive ( it can be a relief to cede control in one area of your life ) , most prefer power to be evenly shared in the bedroom			0
apart from anything else , this type of lovemaking means you ca n't caress or hold your beloved , which takes away half the point for many people			2
it 's also hard to adopt a whole new sexual persona when you 've been making love to the same person for two or three decades			0
what works in your imagination may well become ridiculous or unwelcome in real life			0
i wonder how much your husband really wants to re-enact @entity3 ( has he even read it ? ) or if his request is really motivated by the desire to try something new to revitalise your sex life			1
why do n't you sit your spouse down and tell him you prefer your pleasure unadulterated by pain , but are more than happy to try gentle experimentation			2
something as simple as the use of a silk scarf as a blindfold can add a whole new sensual dimension to your erotic life			0
it always seems to me that any measure that prevents two long - term lovers from catching eyes and bursting out laughing is a good idea			0
the great @entity120 sense of humour can prove detrimental in the bedroom			0
the main thing is that you find a compromise together			0
sometimes it 's gracious not to issue an outraged ' no ! ' to your partner when you can find a way of changing the terms of the question .			0

@entity3 was *incredibly* popular
that does n't mean its female fans are desperate for light bondage
your husband may be motivated by a desire to try something new
