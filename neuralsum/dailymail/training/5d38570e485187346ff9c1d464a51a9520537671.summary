by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 06:47 est , 24 january 2013 after a seven - year battle with anorexia and bulimia , starving herself some days and making herself sick up to three times on others , @entity1 decided she 'd had enough			1
but after deciding to regain control of her life , the 23 - year - old from @entity9 , @entity10 , was told by doctors that her road to recovery would be more difficult than anticipated			1
@entity1 , now 31 , was told that her behaviour had left her at serious risk of a heart attack and infertility			1
on top of which she was diagnosed with endometriosis , a painful gynecological condition which can cause infertility , and told that she could even be left bed - bound some days			1
determining she would prove the doctors wrong , @entity1 took up the most gruelling form of physical exercise she could think of : body building			1
@entity1 during her struggle with eating disorders , left , and in 2012 competing in a @entity32 body building competition , right speaking to @entity33 , @entity1 said : ' all through my teens i suffered with eating disorders , switching between binging on food and making myself sick , to not eating much but strawberry lace sweets to keep me going for days at a time			1
' my face would swell up from the binging , then go down and i would look skinny , then puff up again			0
' i was always very active , going to dance classes every day of the week and playing sports , so the fluctuating in my weight was put down to my exercise levels and my eating disorder went undetected for years			1
my eating was what i feel i had control over - it was my little dark secret			2
' when she finally visited the doctor , @entity1 admits his diagnosis that her life and fertility were at risk ' scared the life out of me '			1
' i was told the extent that i had the endometriosis would leave me bed bound some days , and certainly unable to train			2
with regards to children , i was told to have a hysterectomy as there was no chance of me having any			2
' i did n't feel anger or sadness , i was totally numb			0
thankfully i ignored this advice			0
' @entity1 had suffered a miscarriage during her eating disorder but did n't tell anyone , not even her partner @entity1 continued : ' during this stage in my life i was in a serious four - year relationship , and believing i would never be able to conceive left me feeling i was n't a proper woman ' i had already miscarried a baby at the beginning of our relationship but had been too ashamed to tell anyone , even my partner			1
i think about my unborn baby everyday of my life			0
' i left my partner , feeling it was the best thing for everyone			0
' @entity1 said : ' one of my aims is to educate people who may be suffering in the same way about the positive effects proper nutrition , training and an optimistic attitude can have ' @entity1 fell into a deep depression , slipping back into her old disordered eating patterns , until one day she leapt out of bed and decided to ' make something ' of her life			1
she said : ' the mind is a powerful thing - and the magic of positive thinking should not be underestimated			0
so i decided i wanted to participate in bodybuilding competitions ! ' this was the ultimate test of focus and hard training , and would ensure i gave my body the exact fuel it needed			0
' @entity1 's old diet was a ramshackle mix of binging and starvation : ' my old diet is difficult to determine because some days all i ate were a few strawberry lace sweets to curb my hunger			2
' on other days i would buy huge amounts of crisps and chocolate and devouring them all throughout the day and then purging later			0
' i did n't even like the taste of them			0
' @entity1 now follows a strict , protein - rich eating plan : breakfast : protein shake and oats snack : chicken and fish with green apples lunch : grilled fish or chicken with green beans and almonds pre-training : protein shake post-training : protein shake dinner : grilled fish , turkey or chicken with green beans before bed : tin of tuna , protein shake or raw egg whites @entity1 said : ' i was crowned number one fitness model in @entity146 , and fifth the world ! in the same month as vegas i married the man of my dreams in a beautiful beach wedding ' in april 2012 @entity1 won her first body building competition , eight years after deciding to cure herself of her eating problems , and was thrilled when @entity154 decided to take her on as one of their sponsored athletes			1
she soon appeared in @entity154 's brochures and website , and even presented on the @entity160			2
she ended 2012 having competed six times , including once in @entity32 in the largest all natural bodybuilding andfitness competition			0
@entity1 said : ' i was crowned number one fitness model in @entity146 , and fifth the world ! in the same month as vegas i married the man of my dreams in a beautiful beach wedding , and i truly believe that one day we will be blessed with children			2
' from my experiences i now devise online personalised food and training plans for individuals whatever their needs might be , and often take part in charity events for @entity176 and b - eat , to help raise awareness of these organisations			0
' one of my aims is to educate people who may be suffering in the same way about the positive effects proper nutrition , training and an optimistic attitude can have			0
