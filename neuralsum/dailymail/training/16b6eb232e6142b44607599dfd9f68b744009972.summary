@entity0 has created an interactive billion pixel image of its @entity3 base - and hidden a few surprises in there			1
the firm work with more than 100 local artists and performers to hide them within the image			1
it claims the new image is the most ambitious interactive image ever created			2
click below to see the interactive image , which you can control with the red buttons the full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty - two - megapixel images			1
this resulted in two 10 - gigapixel half panoramas , recording the city in fantastic detail , but still somewhat lacking in people			2
the team then returned to the same spot six times with a @entity26 digital slr with lenses ranging from 400 mm to 600 mm to capture the artists and performers , before combining them into the final , 20 gigapixel ( 20,000 megapixels ) , super high - resolution 360 - degree panorama image			1
' the @entity34 project pushes the boundaries of the technology to deliver an image that allows anyone to pan and zoom through the city of @entity3 with an amazing level of detail , ' @entity0 said			1
' in a fun twist , visitors to the site can discover more than 100 artists and performers in public spaces and in private buildings , near important @entity3 landmarks and on random street corners , acting alone or interacting with onlookers			2
it said the key to the project was finding a location with a clear view of @entity3			0
' we started looking at @entity3 as our canvas , ' said @entity58 , who spearheaded the project , and also did much of the location scouting and secured the condo building that was eventually used			0
' we first sought out the perfect rooftop location from which to shoot such a panorama			2
' we were lucky enough to find the @entity65 condominium building , and thanks to the gracious owners , get access to amazing 360 - degree views that include the @entity70 , the @entity71 , and @entity3 's stadiums , as well @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75			1
the ' @entity76 ' to look out for in the image artists hidden in the project include this bizarre cardboard car ' driven ' by @entity3 artist @entity81 @entity82 decided to insert a spacecraft into the image to show what @entity3 's future might look like local band @entity87 decided to dress as cardboard robots for their appearance in the massive panoramic image ' we also discussed the project with @entity93 , who has deep roots in the @entity3 art scene			1
' he helped us attract great interest from the arts community to come out and help create this celebration of the arts in @entity3			0
' @entity93 introduced us to @entity100 , who coordinated the efforts of everyone involved in producing the entire piece			0
' and finally , videographer @entity104 helped us assemble a team to shoot video footage of the artists and performers from the ground			2
' the full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty - two - megapixel images			1
the team stitched these images together using @entity115 's @entity114 ( @entity117 ) software , which is available for free			2
this resulted in two 10 - gigapixel half panoramas , recording the city in fantastic detail , but still somewhat lacking in people			0
' over the next few weeks , we climbed to the roof six more times to capture individual artists , acrobats , and other performers at dozens of locations visible in the panorama , ' said @entity58			1
these photos were captured from precisely the same spots on the roof as the panorama shots , using a @entity26 digital slr with lenses ranging from 400 mm to 600 mm. one of the incredible panoramas captured by the team			0
landmarks visible include the @entity70 , the @entity71 , and @entity3 's stadiums , as well @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 - as well as 100 local performers and artists the team began work on the project in october - and it was finally launched today			1
' beginning on a brilliant sunny day in october , we climbed up to the roof to capture our first panorama using a @entity26 digital slr camera , a professional 400 mm lens , and a @entity152 robotic tripod head , ' said @entity58			0
' we captured two half panoramas from opposite corners of the roof because no single spot had a perfect view in all directions ( this explains the seams you see )			0
' while we captured still shots of the performers from the roof , video crews filmed the events on the ground			0
' at @entity115 , @entity166 digitally put the the individual shots of artists and performers into the final 20 - gigapixel panorama			1
meanwhile , the video footage from the ground and other media was assembled to create short video vignettes			0
finally , @entity175 built a web site that provides the world access to the panorama and other media			0
' the result is the @entity34 , ' says @entity0			1
' we hope you have as much fun exploring the imagery as we had creating it			0

@entity0 worked with local artists to place them into the giant image
full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty - two - megapixel images
hidden objects include a spaceship set to take to the *skies* , and a giant @entity196 figure
