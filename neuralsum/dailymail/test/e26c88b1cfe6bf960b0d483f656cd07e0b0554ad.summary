@entity7 , 50 , suffers from @entity8 , or @entity8 , which is caused by a gene malfunction that causes the bubble - like bumps to appear all over his body			1
however , he says he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life now that he has joined the @entity16 where he has met performers including a bearded lady and @entity20 's smallest couple			1
' when i met the performers , there was a feeling of belonging			1
i felt at home , ' @entity7 told @entity26			2
@entity41 , the owner , saw @entity7 and recognized his condition as @entity43 and began talking to him			1
' i went to the front , took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy , ' @entity7 told the @entity26			2
he accepted @entity41 's offer to join the show as the ' bubble boy ' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare			1
for @entity56 , the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged			0
he noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face , but now he does			0

' i have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive , but not so much now			0
' to have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before			0
@entity7 said : ' when i met the performers , there was a feeling of belonging			1
i felt at home ' staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support			0
@entity41 said that some people will see @entity56 's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious			0
as @entity56 manages his job in @entity34 and his new role as a performer , he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the @entity16			0
