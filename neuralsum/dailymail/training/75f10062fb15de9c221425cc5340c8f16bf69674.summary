royal seal of approval : @entity9 wore her beige @entity2 coat whilst visiting her sister @entity3 in hospital yesterday @entity0 was spotted in a beige , belted @entity2 coat during her visit to the hospital with brother @entity37 yesterday afternoon			1
fashion fans were so desperate to emulate her style that the £ 124.99 classic mac went on to sell out online overnight			1
and it seems that @entity0 is n't the brand 's only famous fan			2

the x factor : @entity7 and @entity6 have both sported the brand boy band fans : x factor groups @entity47 and @entity59 are also big fans of the label fashion savvy pregnant @entity62 is also a huge fan and wrapped up warm in their tassel cardigan whilst out and about in @entity66 , an item also favoured by @entity68 is @entity70 's @entity69			1
