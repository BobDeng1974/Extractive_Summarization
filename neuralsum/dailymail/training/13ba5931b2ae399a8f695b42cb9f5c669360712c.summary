by @entity0 - parkinson published : 02:24 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 06:41 est , 26 june 2012 the computer failure that has affected millions of @entity3 customers for the past week meant one man who was unable to pay for bail had to spend an entire weekend in prison			1
@entity7 , 25 , appeared at @entity8 on friday charged with attempted rape , assault by penetration and indecent assault			0
he was granted bail on condition a surety , believed to be £ 25,000 , was paid before his release			1
but the computer glitch meant the money was not transferred to the courts ’ service bank account before closing time on friday			1
a court official also tried to check it had been processed on saturday but the payment had still not been made			0
a @entity3 customer had to spend a weekend in a remand cell after he was unable to pay bail surety at @entity8 millions of customers have been unable to carry out transactions following the technical problems faced by @entity3 @entity7 , from @entity8 , was finally allowed to leave custody on monday on the bail condition he went to stay at an address in @entity33			1
in a separate case a defendant at @entity35 was released after a judge used his discretion to grant bail despite a similar problem occurring			1
a spokesman for @entity42 said : “ defendants are released on bail once confirmation of the receipt of bail is received			1
' we are aware of only two cases where there was a banking issue			0
we were advised of one case ( at @entity53 ) by barristers on monday morning			0
' it related to a case last friday and court staff used their discretion to ensure that the defendant was released as soon as possible on monday			2
' in the second case ( at @entity63 ) the judge made a judicial decision last friday to release the defendant given the circumstances			1
' elsewhere , customers have been left unable to pay bills , do their grocery shopping or make essential transfers since wednesday as a result of it problems			1
many people went unpaid as a result of the error but they were able to go to @entity3 branches with proof of employment and given up to £ 300 to tide them over			0
it is expected that it will take until the middle of this week for all the problems to be rectified but for many there will be an ongoing issue of having to contact their banks to claim back any automatic charges incurred as a result of the problems			0
it was revealed last night that the flawed computer programme was being supervised by an it support team in @entity92 and yesterday @entity93 , chief executive of @entity94 , faced calls to forefeit his bonus over the fiasco			1
last february , @entity94 advertised for a series of key jobs , paying between £ 9,000 and £ 11,000 a year , in the @entity92 city of @entity101 , much less than what an equivalent worker would be paid in @entity104			1
the banking giant was urgently seeking computer graduates with several years experience of using @entity108 - 7 , the programme which the bank uses to run its vast network of transactions and accounts			2
the job advertisement said : ' looking for candidates having 4 - 7 years of experience in @entity117 using ca - 7 tool			0
' but last night technology website @entity121 claimed that this software needed to be updated and this task was overseen from @entity92 by staff who are employed to work around the clock to solve any faults			1
@entity94 has been swift to deny that its controversial job out - sourcing programme has been responsible for the fiasco			2
it merely says that the ' software error occurred on a @entity104 - based piece of software ' but has declined to say where the staff overseeing the software are based			2
it is a fact that the vast computer servers are based in @entity104			2
but insiders confirmed last night that many of their support team are based in @entity92			1
since being rescued by the taxpayer @entity94 has shed about 30,000 jobs , including more than 20,000 @entity104 - based roles , and has outsourced work abroad			1
some of its it support teams are now said to be based in @entity92 , even though the under - fire banking group 's headquarters remain in @entity148			1
the unite union questioned whether the ' off - shoring ' job cuts had left the bank unable to cope after the software failure			2
last night insiders said problems began on tuesday night when @entity155 was updated			0
on a normal evening , this should allow all the cashpoint withdrawals , salary transfers and direct debits to be updated			0
the nightly update is the reason why internet banking transactions made by so many customers are not updated if they are made after a certain time of the day			0
but what appears to have happened is that crucial files were deleted			0
the error was spotted but – incredibly – was repeated on wednesday and again on thursday			0
it was only on friday morning that staff realised the full scale of the crisis			0
urgent calls to @entity92 followed and troubleshooters were drafted in			1
the problem was that every single transaction that was waiting in the queue had to be reprocessed in strict order of arrival , causing further delays over last weekend			0
@entity94 has consistently denied that the decision to relocate jobs to @entity92 has made any difference to its handling of the situation			1
the it support team for the failed computer program is based in @entity101 , @entity92 ' out of touch ' : outspoken @entity189 peer @entity188 has said there should be ' no question ' of @entity93 , chief executive of @entity3 parent @entity94 , receiving a bonus from the state - controlled bank this year but critics said that if the number of @entity104 - based support staff had been cut back , it would always run the risk of problems if there was a major fault			1
last night @entity108 , which owns @entity155 , declined to comment on what had caused the problem			0
the fiasco is believed to be the longest and most widespread problem of its kind since the advent of computer banking			2
which ? said it raised questions about how robust systems were at other banks			0
@entity104 's major banks have all faced criticism that they are reliant on constantly grafting software updates on to their complex computer systems rather than replacing the systems themselves			2
@entity221 , the editor of @entity223 magazine , told @entity224 : ' what should have been a minor glitch has led to a pretty disastrous cock - up			2
' he questioned why a back - up system did not appear to have been in place to protect the bank against a software failure			0
the executive directly responsible for the bank 's it systems is chief administrative officer @entity236			0
his pay and bonus are not disclosed because he does not sit on the main board , but he is understood to receive a six - figure package			2
leading @entity189 peer @entity188 accused the back of a ' monumental systematic failure ' adding that there was ' no question ' of @entity93 receiving an annual bonus from the state - owned bank - if he was allowed to keep his job			1
as well as his short - term bonus , @entity249 is also eligible for £ 7.9million of long term incentive awards over a number of years , provided he meets performance targets			0
mr @entity93 took home more than £ 1.2million last year after he agreed to waive a £ 1.6million bonus following weeks of political pressure			1
but he can not even guarantee that the crisis – which has led to a backlog of 100million transactions – will have been ironed out by the end of the week amid claims from insiders that the ‘ priority incident ’ is far from being resolved			0
customers called for him to resign and accused @entity94 and its subsidiaries , @entity3 and @entity266 , of repeatedly lying about fixing the computer fault which triggered the week of misery for the group ’s 16.9million account holders .			1
