ash dieback is still decimating the countryside , and threatening healthy trees like his one , almost a year after it first struck in @entity4 tree disease ash dieback is still decimating the countryside almost a year after it first struck in @entity4			1
the deadly fungus , which is rife across mainland @entity7 , is now out of control in the @entity9 and @entity9 of @entity10 and there have been outbreaks in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
@entity16 was confirmed as the 15th @entity10 county with the fungal disease after staff on the @entity21 ’s @entity20 near @entity22 discovered blighted leaves on a handful of ash trees this month			1
the latest official figures reveal there are 571 infected sites in @entity4 , with 334 linked to imported ash trees , 213 in the wider environment and 24 in nurseries			1
but the actual figure could be higher because as the disease has taken hold , there has been less urgency to report new cases			0
@entity39 staff are now conducting a new survey of woodlands in the @entity9 and @entity9 of @entity10 to gain a clearer picture of the how disease has spread in the wild			1
infected trees are no longer being felled , in the hope of finding mature trees that are resistant to the disease , which is known as @entity0			2
once the traits associated with resistance are identified , resistant trees can be developed			0
@entity0 was found for the first time in the @entity53 last month , at three sites near the town of @entity56 in @entity57			0
a man burns saplings in a bid to stop the spread of ash dieback disease @entity63 , forestry and woodlands adviser at the @entity66 , said : ‘ there is a general acceptance that it is going to be impossible to eradicate the disease and slow the spread			2
’ @entity71 , head of conservation at the @entity73 , said : ‘ @entity75 dieback has spread across the country in devastating fashion over the past 12 months			0
' it has become clear that stopping its spread is an impossible task			0
what we need to focus on now is building a resilient wooded landscape			0
‘ by doing so our precious woodland stands a better chance of resisting the many threats posed by disease			0
’ it has become clear that stopping the spread of ash dieback fungus ( pictured ) is ' an impossible task ' the @entity39 denied the disease was ‘ out of control ’ but a spokesman said : ‘ everyone agrees it is currently neither possible nor feasible to eradicate it			2
‘ sensibly , efforts are concentrating on monitoring and slowing the disease			0
infected ash trees that were planted some time ago have been found at a small number of sites , but more research would be required to check if they were infected when they were planted or more recently			1
’ plant health chiefs confirmed the first case of the disease in the @entity110 countryside last october at @entity111 in @entity112 , a site owned by the @entity73			2
as autumn sets in , it is easy to spot diseased ash trees because their leaves are black and do not fall .			1
