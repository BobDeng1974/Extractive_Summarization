sir @entity0 has claimed @entity1 is ' profoundly un-british in every way ' just days before the party looks set to beat his in a crucial by - election			1
the former conservative prime minister blasted the ' sheer nastiness ' of @entity8 's party and said it was ' anti-everything ... anti-politics , anti-foreigner , anti-immigrant , anti-aid '			1
several polls suggest @entity13 will become @entity1 's second mp after thursday 's @entity16 and @entity17 poll , which was triggered when he defected from the @entity18			2
that 's not the way to get into @entity31 and not the way to run a country ... so they may be elected because people are frustrated ' a victory would be an echo of fellow defector @entity38 , who won @entity39 in @entity40 in a landslide for his new party last month			1
sir @entity0 told the @entity45 's @entity44 show : ' i think many of the people who are voting for them are doing so out of frustration at the ongoing difficulties of the recession , the belief that they are losing out and falling behind			1
' that will fade away as the economy improves , and it is materially improving			2
' in his strongly - worded attack he added : ' the policies of @entity1 , the direction of @entity1 , is , it seems to me , profoundly un-british in every way			0
they are anti-politics , they are anti-foreigner , they are anti-immigrant , they are anti-aid			1
confident : @entity8 supporting his candidate , who looks set to win , at @entity16 's @entity68 last week ' i do n't know what they are for , we know what they are against			1
that 's the negativity of the four - ale bar , that 's not the way to get into @entity31 and not the way to run a country			2
' so they may be elected because people are frustrated			2
' sir @entity0 highlighted the @entity85 appeal and @entity86 , adding : ' what a counterpoint that is to the negativity and sheer nastiness of much of what @entity1 stands for			1
' appeal : @entity94 told @entity95 today the @entity96 was ' too big , too bossy , too interfering ' today mr @entity8 told @entity97 he was ' confident but not complacent ' that mr @entity13 would win , partly on the back of a collapse in the @entity101 vote in the seat			2
' we are smashing the @entity101 vote to pieces , ' he said			0
' this is not a straight fight between @entity1 and the @entity18 '			0
a lord @entity108 poll last week @entity101 in third on 17 per cent , with @entity1 on 44 per cent and the @entity109 trailing far behind them on 32 per cent			0
@entity111 has warned that a @entity1 win would put the country at greater risk of ' insecurity and instability in our economy '			0
the prime minister warned voters in the @entity122 constituency that they risk becoming another notch on the bedpost of mr @entity8 's party , who would celebrate victory with ' a pint in the pub '			1
he would not represent the area as well as locally - born @entity109 candidate @entity131 , mr @entity111 added			0
despite sir @entity0 's comments , @entity109 chairman @entity94 made another appeal to @entity136 voters today as he said the @entity96 was ' too bossy '			1
he acknowledged the @entity18 had ' a problem ' with hitting their target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the parliament , partly because of @entity96 migrants attracted by the relative strength of the @entity145 economy			0
he told @entity95 : ' @entity111 , absolutely rightly , is saying on behalf of the @entity145 people we do n't think this is an open - ended deal , we believe that we should have some control over people coming here			0
' people can come here to work , yes , but not to claim benefits			0
' he added : ' most people in this country think @entity157 is too big , too bossy , too interfering			0

sir @entity0 blasted ' sheer nastiness ' of @entity8 's party in @entity45 *interview*
' they are anti-everything , anti-foreigner , anti-immigrant , anti-aid ' , he said
he conceded party may be elected because the public is frustrated
but he urged public to think of *positivity* of *charity* appeal for @entity85
