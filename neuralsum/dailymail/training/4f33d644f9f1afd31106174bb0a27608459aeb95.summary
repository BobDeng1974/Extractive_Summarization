by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor pollsters say it is only when politicians and journalists become sick and tired of soundbites that voters start to even notice			2
but @entity8 leader @entity7 may have taken the advice a little too literally , after grinding out the same attacks on the government in response to yesterday 's budget			1
he faced criticism for failing to address any of the measures actually announced by @entity16 , but examination of his speech shows that his slogans on borrowing , bankers and the @entity22 were all just a case of history repeating			1
the tie and the haircut might change , but @entity8 leader @entity7 has used the same @entity27 in ( left to right ) 2014 , 2013 , 2012 and 2011 mr @entity7 was repeatedly interrupted during his speech in the @entity29 yesterday , with deputy speaker @entity30 having to call for quiet			1
but there was no mention of any of the policy changes announced by mr @entity16 , even those trailled in the media in the days before			1
privately many @entity36 were dismayed at their leader 's response			1
shadow chancellor @entity39 said mr @entity7 had faced a ' difficult speech ' because he had planned to attack policies which ended up not being included			1
mr @entity39 told journalists : ‘ @entity7 had written pages of his speech which were n’t used in the end , which he thought might be in there that were n’t , but he had to fill the space by going on and on about @entity50 ’s comments			1
’ it is thought the @entity8 leadership had fallen for speculation on @entity54 that mr @entity16 would move to cut income tax , but when it failed to appear mr @entity7 had to tear up large chunks of his speech			1
aides also complained that @entity8 had not been given early sight of the budget to help them to prepare			2
so instead mr @entity7 turned to his earlier budget speeches for inspiration , starting with an observation about how long mr @entity16 spoke for , accusing him of giving with one hand and taking with the other and rounding off with a swipe at an ' out - of - touch chancellor '			1
here we examine what mr @entity7 said in the @entity29 yesterday , and how his attacks have echoed down the years ... 2014 : ‘ the chancellor spoke for nearly an hour			2
but he did not mention one central fact			2
the working people of @entity74 are worse off under the @entity75 ’			1
2012 : ‘ the chancellor spoke for an hour			2
but there was one phrase that did not pass his lips			2
one claim he has abandoned			2
‘ we ’re all in this together ’ 2011 : ‘ the chancellor spoke for nearly an hour			2
but one fact says it all			2
growth down last year , this year and next year ’ 2014 : ‘ 2011 - living standards down			1
2012 - living standards down			1
2013 - living standards down ’ 2013 : ‘ growth last year , down			1
growth this year , down			2
growth next year , down ’ 2012 : ‘ growth down last year			2
growth down next year ’ 2014 : ‘ it ’s a classic @entity75 con			1
give with one hand and take far more away with another			2
’ 2013 : ‘ the chancellor is giving with one hand , and taking far more away with the other ’ 2012 : ‘ all he is doing for ordinary families is giving with one hand and taking far more away with the other ’ 2011 : ‘ let me tell you what the @entity100 told us this morning : ‘ there is an awful lot of giving with one hand			2
and taking away with lots and lots of other hands ’			2
it 's the classic @entity75 con			1
2014 : ‘ and these are the people that had the nerve to tell us we ’re all in this together			2
it ’s the same old @entity75			1
’ 2012 : ‘ wrong choices			2
’ 2011 : ‘ every @entity75 tax cut ends up costing them more			1
same old deceit ’ 2014 : ‘ maybe today we can get the straight answer we have n’t had so far ? will he rule out a further tax cut for millionaires to 40p ? just nod your head if you ’re ruling it out ! ’ 2013 : ‘ so come on			2
nod your head if you are getting the 50p tax rate ’ 2012 : ‘ just nod if you ’re going to benefit from it , or shake your head if you ’re not			2
come on , we ’ve got plenty of time			0
’ repetition : this word cloud shows how people and tax dominated mr @entity7 's speech in response to the 2014 budget 2014 : ' what is the latest rebrand from the @entity22 ? ' 2013 : ' the @entity22 boys really are both in it together			1
' 2014 : ' this recovery ’s not working for working people			0
' 2012 : ' the truth is that for ordinary families , it ’s hurting but it ’s not working			0
' 2011 : ' it 's hurting but it is n't working			1
' 2014 : ‘ so the prime minister chooses to afford a tax cut of £ 200,000 for a banker			0
but he ca n’t afford a pay rise of £ 250 for a nurse			0
’ 2013 : ‘ @entity158 the banker , remember him ? he ’s had a tough year , earning just £ 1m			0
what does he get ? he gets a tax cut of £ 42,500 next year			0
£ 42,500 , double the average wage			0
’ 2012 : ‘ that is this chancellor ’s priority – giving 14,000 millionaires over £ 40,000 each			0
and what happens to families who earn in one year half what the chancellor has so casually given away to the richest in the last hour ? families on £ 20,000 a year – the nurse , the lorry driver ’ 2014 : ‘ under them it ’s a recovery for the few not the many ’ 2013 : ‘ and they do n’t understand , you need a recovery made by the many not just a few at the top ’ 2012 : ‘ unfair			0
for the few , not the many			0
’ @entity183 and his tum were just behind me – on budget day lots of mps use upstairs overspill benches which abut the press gallery			0
gaseous , pre-prandial rumblings emanated from his direction			0
they sounded like a boiler we replaced at home last week			0
@entity16 ’s changes to investment tax breaks found favour			1
‘ @entity200 , ’ exhaled @entity183			0
@entity202 snufflings and hoggy gruntlings sounded from the depths of the @entity183 maw when mr @entity16 extended limits for @entity207 and lending for exports			1
@entity210 : @entity7 's response to @entity16 unveiling the big'un was almost void of financial content then the chancellor reached his clincher , the unexpected announcement about pensions			1
no one , not even @entity183 , knew what to think			0
cue panic in the press corridor , reporters turning to one another and saying : ‘ annuities ? remind me			0
what the heck are they ? ’ a slimmed @entity16 spoke for 57 minutes			1
at the end , @entity229 did their customary ballyhoo and mr @entity16 gulped down water			1
his voice had been fading badly			0
had the budget been any longer , he would have needed a squirt of @entity236 , or subtitles			0
the chancellor looked genuinely drained – relieved , too			0
his face at the end seemed to say ‘ crumbs , i did it ’			0
after past budgets he has often looked cocky but this expression was different			0
it was as though he realised it was a big ’ un			0
the silence from the @entity8 benches reinforced that impression			0
@entity7 ’s remarkably vacuous response did not much lift @entity8 ’s gloom			0
the @entity253 's remarkably vacuous response did nothing to lift his party 's gloomy silence the main words in mr @entity16 ’s speech were ‘ saver ’ and ‘ resilient ’			1
there was all this stuff about steady - as - she - goes and restoring the economy brick by brick			1
then , wham , he concluded with the beyond - @entity265 freeing of pensions			1
a pitch for @entity269 sympathisers ? maybe			0
it certainly looks a defining moment for mr @entity16 ’s @entity272 years			1
what heckling there was from @entity8 ( deputy speaker @entity30 had little trouble keeping order ) came chiefly from that party ’s women			0
@entity280 ’s @entity279 barked the occasional insult and frontbencher @entity282 , standing near @entity283 , kept up a running commentary of abuse			0
‘ @entity288 about the debt ? ’ bawled @entity286 ( @entity287 )			0
@entity290 ( @entity291 ) muttered and twitched , a hobgoblin from @entity294 ’s @entity293			0
@entity39 kept doing a discreet thumb gesture , a furtive hitch - hiker			1
big @entity297 ( lab , @entity300 ) sat in a splodge of silence , nibbling on a petite little pinky : such a hefty yet his poise so balletic			0
on the @entity75 side , slinky @entity305 , education minister , sat on the floor , stretching her pale @entity308 ( con , @entity309 ) strode over to check her tender bottom was not in any distress			1
@entity312 ( @entity313 ) cleaned his spectacles with a large mouchoir			0
@entity39 roared laughting as @entity16 compared @entity7 to @entity158 , a weak leader who betrayed his brother @entity318 , a whip , was another @entity75 woman on the floor			1
she perched there , peering over baronet sir @entity323 ’s right shoulder like @entity326 ’s parrot			0
moments of levity : hearing a tax break for bingo , @entity332 ’s @entity331 , having campaigned for it , cried ‘ @entity340 ! ’ ; and mr @entity16 mentioned a grant to the @entity334 , simply so that he could refer to @entity158 as ‘ a weak leader who had risen to the top after betraying his brother , compelled by a gang of unruly barons to sign on the dotted line ’			1
the @entity340 twigged the @entity7 / trade unions analogy			0
mr @entity39 roared with laughter			1
when mr @entity16 hailed improving prospects in the north of @entity346 , @entity282 ’s atonal soprano gave a ‘ have you ever been there ? ’ mr @entity16 ’s @entity350 constituency is actually next to @entity351			1
labour glumness was now so evident that smoothiechops @entity354 ( con , @entity355 ) shouted : ‘ @entity356 ! ’ the chancellor was watched from the @entity359 gallery by not only his mother but also his wife and their daughter			1
the little poppet ( daughter , that is ) was rapt for the first ten minutes			0
the following 47 she found more of a test			0
join the club , honeybun			0
mr @entity7 ’s @entity370 response , almost entirely free of financial content , was the speech of a chef trying to make an omelette without eggs			2
it was a chopped , half - fried , gabbled nothingness , little more than a smear of slogans			1

labour leader criticised for not addressing any of @entity16 's policies
instead he used speech to roll - out well worn slogans attacking the @entity75
even his opening line has been used several times before
@entity39 said ' difficult ' speech was the result of false @entity54 speculation
