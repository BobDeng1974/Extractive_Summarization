a couple in their 40s became unusual victims of age discrimination after @entity8 rejected a £ 250,000 mortgage application because it deemed the husband to be too old in the first case of its kind , the @entity28 found the lender guilty of being ‘ unfair ’			1
@entity8 was ordered to pay £ 500 to the couple for their ‘ distress and inconvenience ’ over the ‘ unfair application of its age policy ’ , and was told to reconsider their loan application			1
bosses at the bank defended their decision and argued it was ‘ entitled to apply a maximum age policy ’ , according to ombudsman documents seen by the newspaper			1
but the ombudsman said : ‘ the bank relied on untested assumptions , stereotypes or generalisations in respect of age			2
’ the couple , who do not wish to be named , applied for the joint interest - only mortgage over 18 years on their home , in which they held substantial equity			2
@entity8 had issued a decision in principle , indicating that they would be prepared to lend the money , but it then refused to proceed due to the husband ’s age			2
the husband , however , does not plan to retire at 65 and his final salary pension would be large enough to cover the monthly repayments			0
he also has pension pots and his wife would have been able to pay the loan from her income alone , if necessary			0
the couple complained and claimed they had been victims of discrimination			0
the complaint was upheld by the ombudsman - the first time it has done so specifically on the grounds of age for a mortgage			0
@entity8 said its decision was based on its age restrictions for interest - only loans , a type of mortgage that allows borrowers to pay off the interest but none of the capital			1
@entity8 was ordered to pay £ 500 to the couple for their ‘ distress and inconvenience ’ over the ‘ unfair application of its age policy ’ , and was told to reconsider their loan application the bank – like many other lenders - has tightened its criteria , and does not offer interest - only loans with a term beyond a borrower ’s 65th birthday			1
for repayment mortgages , the age ceiling is 75			0
the bank told @entity22 : ‘ as a responsible lender , we need to ensure our customers ’ ability to repay their mortgage			0
‘ with interest - only lending we also need to understand how a customer will repay the capital when the mortgage matures			0
‘ regulatory requirements to show responsible lending and the repayment vehicles associated with interest - only loans have become more stringent since this application was made			0
‘ it ’s important to stress that when we look at a mortgage application we take a number of different factors into account , which includes assessing each customer ’s individual circumstances			0
’ the ombudsman ’s decision offers hope for borrowers who have struggled to get mortgages due to strict policies on age and income .			2
