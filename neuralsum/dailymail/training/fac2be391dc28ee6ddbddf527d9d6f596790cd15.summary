’ following ms @entity0 's diagnosis in december critics slammed procedures at @entity219 where the nurse was allowed to board a flight to @entity30 despite complaining of a temperature			1
within hours of landing , ms @entity0 was rushed to @entity224 before being transferred to the @entity26 in a military aircraft			1
following her diagnosis authorities frantically tried to hunt down the dozens of people she may have come into contact with at the airport and on board flights from @entity8 to @entity232 and @entity27 to @entity30			2
anyone on board the aircraft was urged to seek medical treatment as soon as possible , with an estimated 32 people having already left the @entity6 by the time ms @entity0 's condition became known			1
after being admitted to the @entity26 on december 30 , concern grew for the nurse 's life as doctors revealed her condition had deteriorated			0
the lack of wonder drug @entity245 which aided the recovery of several others to have been infected , was among factors making her chance of recovery ever more slight			2
while in hospital she was treated with convalescent plasma taken from the blood of recovered @entity256 patients and the experimental anti-viral drug @entity257 , which is not the same as @entity259 , which was used to treat @entity261 - a @entity6 nurse who recovered from the disease in august			1
mr @entity261 was the first @entity6 person to test positive for the disease in @entity264			0
he was hurriedly removed from @entity8 following his diagnosis in august and recovered in time to deliver a heart wrenching speech released on christmas day			2
the 29 - year - old , who has since returned to the disease - stricken country to help treat sufferers , described @entity7 as ' a global problem ' which ' will take the world to fix '			1
anyone who returns from working in ebola - hit regions like @entity8 are handed or sent self - monitoring kits to be used for 21 - days after they return to the @entity6			2
they contain items to help them test their temperature and help them cope if they were to have the killer disease before the authorities arrive			0
@entity285 did not have enough of these kits at @entity219 for the 30 - strong group including @entity0 that arrived in the @entity6 on sunday night			2
as a result the authorities had to courier some to their homes			0
the kit is split into two parts , the first to monitor their health and the second to be used if they fall ill. they have an electronic ear thermometer to measure temperature accurately because a high fever can be a sign of @entity7			0
they also have recording sheets to note them down			0
some of the highest risk patients are asked to call in each day before midday to tell @entity305 staff whether they are unwell			0
if they are showing symptoms they have a number of items to help clear up fluid like vomit and diarrhoea , then disinfect and dispose of the hazardous waste			0
these include bags for hazardous waste , super strength disinfectant , disposable gloves and super-absorbent gel to soak up liquid			0
this is because bodily fluids are one of the key ways @entity7 can be spread			0
if they are ill they must immediately call a doctor and they will be taken into hospital and put into isolation while they are tested for @entity7 .			2
