by @entity0 @entity2 's future as @entity4 manager is in serious doubt			1
@entity6 understands the @entity7 feels he may have taken the club as far as it can go with him at the helm and is giving his position careful consideration			1
fresh from winning a third successive @entity15 league title , @entity2 should now be plotting the route to a @entity18 group campaign			2
going out on a high ? @entity4 boss @entity2 clutches the @entity21 trophy - which may be his last returning hero ? @entity23 has been installed as favourite to become new boss but he ’s believed to be concerned about having the quality in his squad to negotiate the three tricky qualifying ties that lie in wait – with the added disadvantage of playing out of @entity32 as @entity33 is out of commission due to the @entity35			1
speculation over @entity2 ’s future intensified when bookmakers @entity38 suddenly slashed the odds on @entity23 – currently in charge of @entity42 club @entity41 - becoming the new manager			1
however , @entity44 , sports director of @entity45 , told @entity6 there has been no contact from @entity4 regarding the legendary striker			2
with @entity2 due to fly off on holiday at the end of this week before a stint as a @entity54 analyst at the @entity56 finals in @entity57 , the former captain is seeking some answers before he goes			2
trusted deputy @entity59 recently quit the club and a decision on his replacement has been shelved until @entity2 ’s own fate becomes clearer			1
speculation is also rife about the immediate futures of @entity66 and @entity67 and @entity2 ’s concerns over the squad would be further heightened were either to be sold before they begin their campaign on july 15			2
shrouded in uncertainty : the futures of @entity67 ( left ) and @entity66 are up in the air barring a dramatic change of heart in the next 48 hours , there ’s every chance @entity4 will be beginning the search for their 17th manager by as soon as next week			2
if that comes to pass , @entity6 believes former @entity4 player and @entity83 manager @entity81 would top the wish list			1
@entity81 holds the club in huge regard and has ambitions to manage at @entity33 one day – but he also has a wish to return to management in the @entity21 sooner rather than later			1
@entity90 , recently sacked by @entity91 , is free to consider a return to his first love but that option seems unlikely			0
@entity95 , the former @entity96 manager , is also in the mix together with @entity99 deputy @entity98			0
@entity100 , the @entity101 manager , would be a popular choice with supporters although the acrimonious nature of his departure to @entity106 in 2005 might count against him			0
@entity23 , meanwhile , went from 20/1 outsider to odds - on favourite with two bookmakers			2
meet the new boss ? @entity100 and former team - mate @entity2 discuss the good old days last month in the running : @entity81 has been touted for a @entity4 return too whoever is appointed the next @entity4 manager has a tough act to follow			1
@entity2 served @entity4 as a player between 2000 and 2007 before returning as first team coach the following season			1
he was demoted to reserve team manager after @entity122 made way for @entity124 but was asked to take charge of the team after the latter was shown the door after an inglorious spell in charge			0
after being given the job on a permanent basis in 2010 , @entity2 built his own side by snapping up the likes of @entity135 , @entity67 and @entity136			0
his side narrowly missed out to @entity138 in the 2010 - 11 @entity139 yet defeated @entity140 to win the @entity141 that season			0
the following season , @entity2 , boosted by the acquisition of @entity145 , finally got his hands on the title and the following term his men took the scalp of @entity150 as they qualified for the last 16 of the @entity18			0
successive league titles were added last year and this – together with another @entity141 in 2013 and another @entity18 qualification last year			0
glory days : @entity2 lifts the @entity141 in 2005 next to @entity100 but it appears increasingly likely that this year ’s title triumph will be his last as @entity4 boss			1
meantime , the @entity161 has postponed @entity4 striker @entity160 ’ disciplinary hearing to allow police to conclude their own investigation into allegations of racist chanting			0
the @entity4 striker was due to face charges of bringing the game into disrepute and acting against the best interests of football on thursday after he was filmed in a pub full of @entity175 supporters before attending the @entity177 derby on april 27			0
but @entity160 ’ lawyer has now won a two - week postponement while @entity180 conclude their own investigation .			0

@entity2 's future at @entity4 is in serious doubt
the @entity7 is said to feel he can take the club as far as he can
bookmaker @entity38 slashed club legend @entity23 's odds of replacing him
former *bhoys* @entity81 and @entity100 have also been touted as possible successors
