turning up the central heating may cost a few pounds , but it could keep off the kilos			1
a new study out on tuesday shows that people who live in warm homes are less likely to be fat and tend to have lower body mass index ( @entity7 ) levels than those who shiver through winter			2
researchers at the @entity11 in @entity12 have uncovered a direct link between higher temperatures and lower levels of body fat in a 13 - year study involving more than 100,000 adults who rely on central heating			1
a study of 100,000 by the @entity11 has found that turning on the central heating during winter could help you keep your weight down they claim it is not just what we eat and how much exercise we do that determines how heavy we are - the temperature at which people heat their homes could have a major impact on whether they can keep to their ideal body weight , the study suggests			1
in recent years scientists have suggested that warmer indoor temperatures have been a major contributing factor to rises in obesity levels in the @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
however , researchers from @entity47 's @entity46 show that the opposite appears to be the case - there is a direct link between higher temperatures and lower levels of body fat			0
the study used @entity7 levels to indicate levels of body fat and noted those who live in well - heated homes are more likely to have low @entity7 levels , while people who spend less time with their heating turned up - or on at all - tend to be heavier			1
while previous studies suggested that warm homes might help cause rising obesity levels , this shows the opposite study co-author dr @entity69 , a behavioural scientist , said : ' we set out to investigate the scientific claims that cooler indoor temperatures help us maintain a healthy weight by pushing our bodies to expend more energy through shivering and generating heat through tissues			1
' in fact , the research suggests people may eat less and burn more energy when residing in a warmer indoor environment			2
' the study takes into account factors such as excessive calorie intake and low levels of physical activity , but it is the first to examine the association between indoor household temperature and population @entity7 levels			0
dr @entity69 said : ' we contrasted @entity7 levels for people living in different temperature groups in @entity95 and found reduced weight levels among people living in homes heated to above 73.4 degrees @entity99 ( 23 degrees @entity100 ) , which was reflective of about 15,000 of the households studied			1
' this research suggests the obesity epidemic could worsen where heating is turned down below comfortable levels , or off , for lengthy periods to cut costs			2
' this is not just about people who live in well - heated homes being in the financial position to afford more expensive low - calorie foods , exercise classes and sporting activities and therefore finding it easier to maintain a low @entity7 level			0
the study took age , gender , social class and other factors into account			0
' the comfortable ambient temperature of 68.5 - 73.4 degrees @entity99 ( 20.3 - 23 degrees @entity100 ) is where we feel comfortable in our clothes and are neither hot , nor cold			0
at temperatures above this we expend more energy and we eat less because our appetite is suppressed			0
' the study is published in the international science journal @entity133 .			0

@entity11 studied 100,000 people over 13 years
those who kept central heating high were likely to be *thinner*
people who turned *thermostat* down were likely to have @entity142
results published today *contradict* previous studies
