the answer to life ’s questions may not lie at the bottom of a bottle of whisky , but a smart label on its side could offer some words of ' wisdom '			1
soon smart labels could grace the sides of @entity13 whisky bottles , which would send advertising messages to consumers who scan them with their phones			0
the labels can also detect when the bottle is sealed and when it is opened			2
a prototype bottle has gone on show at @entity26 in @entity27 the prototype ‘ smart bottle ’ has gone on show at @entity26 in @entity27			1
it is the brainchild of drinks giant @entity31 and @entity32 , which develops printed electronics			1
the bottle has sensor tags using @entity32 's @entity37 technology on its labels that allow the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky , or afterwards			2
it uses a smartphone ’s near field communication ( @entity47 ) capabilities so that a handset can be hovered over the label to unlock its digital secrets			1
the bottle has sensor tags using @entity32 's @entity37 technology on its label that allows the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky , or afterwards			1
it also tells a user that the bottle was properly sealed and when it is open ( illustrated by the prototype ) scanning the label could , for example , give consumers special offers , cocktail recipes or film content			1
the technology could also be useful for the @entity67 - based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes			1
the sensor tags will remain readable after the factory seal has been broken so that they provide ‘ an additional layer of security in protecting the authenticity of the product , ’ @entity31 says			1
this is because unlike static @entity79 , which are easy to copy and do n’t include sensors , the new labels will be permanently encoded in the factory do they ca n’t be copied or electronically modified			0
scanning the label ( pictured ) with a phone could , for example , give consumers special offers , cocktail recipes or film content			2
the technology could also be useful for the @entity67 - based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes the cloud - based software behind the integration is powered by a company called @entity98 , which is delivering the mobile experience activated through the product label			1
‘ mobile technology is changing the way we live and as a consumer brands company we want to embrace its power to deliver amazing new consumer experiences in the future , ’ said @entity101 , global innovation driver , at @entity31			1
‘ our collaboration with @entity111 allows us to explore all the amazing new possibilities enabled by smart - bottles for consumers , retailers and our own business and it sets the bar for technology innovation in the drinks industry			1
’ @entity120 , ceo of @entity111 , said : ‘ today 's conventional @entity47 mobile marketing solutions are not technologically advanced enough to create immersive or customisable consumer experiences			1
’ but he says that the ‘ smart bottle ’ technology will provide @entity31 with intelligence as well as creating ‘ engaging experiences for its customers ’			1
rare , vintage bottles of whisky can cost anywhere up to $ 1.4 million ( £ 874,150 ) and can be aged in oak barrels stored in cellars for years			0
but there 's a wooden tool that saves time and money called ‘ @entity136 , ’ which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours			2
the oak sticks are specially designed to ‘ age ’ the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whisky with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples			2
whiskey element claims to make cheap alcohol taste like expensive whiskey by infusing it with a woody flavour when placed in a decanter ( pictured ) the sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall - surface area touching the liquid			0
they are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whisky to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple			0
they do this via ‘ accelerated transpiration through capillary action , ’ according to the @entity169 , @entity170 - based company ’s @entity167 page , which means the liquid travels through tiny tubes in the wood			2
@entity174 explained that wood barrels are used for containing whisky because the wood is cut vertically so that capillaries are not exposed to the liquid , meaning that it does n't slowly seep out of the sides of the wood			0
the sticks are made by cutting the wood horizontally to provide a ‘ shorter distance for whisky to travel through its repetitive exposure to the capillaries , so it matures much faster and becomes of a much higher quality			2
’ to test the product , the inventors put their sticks through their paces in the lab , where they compared top shelf whiskey costing over $ 100 a bottle that had been aged for over 10 years , with cheaper versions treated with a whiskey element			0
they analysed the chemicals found in expensive and cheap whisky			0
researchers found that the cheap bottles contained high levels of @entity205 – found in pig and mouse faeces – and @entity208 , a compound blamed for hangovers			0
in comparison , the expensive aged bottles contained almost none of either			0
the researchers then added the oak sticks to the cheap liquor and waited 24 hours before testing them again			0
mr @entity174 said : ‘ the results were amazing			0
they showed characteristics found in top - shelf aged whiskeys with notably higher levels of the chemicals responsible for good flavours and smells , as well as a significant reduction in @entity224 and @entity208			0
’ a two pack of the sticks cost $ 12 ( £ 7.50 ) .			0

prototype ‘ smart bottle ’ is on show at @entity26 in @entity27
it ’s a *partnership* between @entity233 drinks firm @entity31 and @entity111
label has sensors in it to show if the bottle is open or sealed
it uses phone ’s @entity47 capabilities to show adverts and recipes , for example
designed to be engaging for customers and provide market intelligence
