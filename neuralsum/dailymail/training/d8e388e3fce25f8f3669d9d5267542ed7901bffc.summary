his parents were alarmed when @entity37 did n't get off the school bus that afternoon , and called the school which then called 911 to report the boy missing			2
fresh search : @entity65 would not detail what was found during the search , citing the criminal investigation @entity69 : around 60 volunteers and two nonprofits helped during the search on saturday and sunday @entity37 's father , @entity73 , sought a restraining order against @entity41 when sheriff ’s investigators told @entity73 that his wife had tried to hire someone to kill him in the months before @entity37 disappeared			1
@entity37 's mother also filed a civil lawsuit against @entity41 , demanding she reveal where the boy or his body is , but it was dropped in july , @entity65 filed the $ 10 million suit against @entity41 last year , alleging the stepmother kidnapped @entity37 , but she dropped the case , saying it could n't move forward without information the police wo n't release because of the ongoing criminal investigation into the boy 's disappearance			1
despite dropped the case , she said she has never given up hope that he will be found alive			1
' every day you are not here safe in my arms is another day of agonizing torture , ' she said at a press conference in @entity100 in july			2
' i will find you			0
it 's all i want			0
' unanswered question : @entity41 , left , the stepmother of @entity37 was the last to see him and was named the ' prime suspect ' by a judge in a civil case last august , which has now been dropped last seen : @entity37 , pictured at a science fair on the morning of june 4 , 2010 , aged 7 , was last seen by his stepmother walking off to class ; this is the last known picture of him heartbreak : @entity65 is pictured with her lawyer earlier this year after dropping her civil case against @entity41 @entity41 has n't commented on @entity65 's allegation , but the desperate mother urged her to cooperate			1
' i 'm still going to bring pressure on @entity41			0
i 'm not going away , ' @entity65 said			0
another twist in the case involves @entity121 , a friend of @entity41 who has testified before the grand jury			2
@entity121 's whereabouts were in question the day @entity37 vanished			2
after @entity37 disappeared , authorities searched the condo @entity121 was working at on june 4 and investigators also put out a flier with @entity121 's photos on it , asking if anyone noticed her or @entity41 between 9:45 a.m. and 1 p.m. on june 4 , 2010			1
but @entity121 refused to answer 142 questions related to his disappearance , pleading the @entity134 and refusing to identify a picture of her friend , whether she knew her husband and if she had ever met @entity37			0
happier times : @entity65 , who said she will never stop searching , smiles and holds her son on the beach playtime : a family photo shows a smiling @entity37 enjoying the playground progression : a composite by @entity147 imagines what @entity37 could look like today , aged 9 court documents say she was at work but left abruptly at 11.30 a.m. and returned 90 minutes later			0
she has declined to say what she did during that time			0
ms @entity7 has accused @entity41 of knowing what happened to her son , telling the @entity154 : ' i believe that @entity41 knows where @entity37 is			0

' she said : ' we 've racked our brains trying to think of reasons why			0
we can not come up with anything			0
it 's like a portal opened up in the school and @entity37 just vanished into it			0
' investigators have long focused on @entity41 , although until this point , had not named her as a suspect or filed criminal charges			0
