disruption to services for at least ten years from *december* 2016
rail bosses are *confident* ‘ works do *n’t* have a catastrophic *effect* on existing services ’ only ‘ from 2017 *onwards* ’
for the rest of the time performance will be ‘ *fragile* ’
fewer than *60* per cent of long - distance services will arrive on time
‘ significant ’ weekend and @entity196 closures with *widespread* disruption in *holiday* *periods* including @entity199
platform numbers at @entity20 reduced from *18* to 13 , with the number of approach tracks reduced from six to four
*virgin* train services will have to leave @entity20 just *25* minutes after arrival , leaving little time for servicing and cleaning
passengers face a *22* per cent shortfall in capacity in *suburban* services to major commuter stations such as @entity215 and @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity2*18* and @entity219 .
construction could *result* in a *reduction* in @entity62 and @entity*22*4 train from three to two an hour
