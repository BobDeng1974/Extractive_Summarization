they are certainly advanced despite their tender years , thanks to their precocious talent and famous parents			2
but even their grown - up fans will be left scratching their heads after reading a new interview the children of @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity11 , 14 , and @entity13 , 16 , sat down with @entity14 to discuss @entity16 energy ( meditation ) , school being overrated and how @entity11 possesses the ability to control time			1
the siblings also rant about how ' life is meditation ' and how babies ' remember ' when they are born			1
the interviewer then asks the pair what themes ' recur ' in their music , to which @entity13 replies ' the melancholiness of the ocean ; the melancholiness of everything else ' while @entity11 describes the feeling of being in a ' holographic reality that a higher consciousness made '			1
it is not surprising , that they both confess they 've already had enough of going to school like normal teenagers			2
' i went to school for one year			2
it was the best experience but the worst experience , ' @entity11 admitted			1
' the best experience because i was , like , " oh , now i know why kids are so depressed			2
" but it was the worst experience because i was depressed , ' she added			2
while @entity13 took aim at @entity63 , suggesting that the amount of car accidents that happen prove school is n't working			2
' you never learn anything in school			2

' @entity13 added : ' here ’s the deal : school is not authentic because it ends			0
it ’s not true , it ’s not real			0
' ' our learning will never end			0
the school that we go to every single morning , we will continue to go to			0
' @entity11 then rather bizarrely claims that time is a concept that she can control with her mind			1
' i mean , time for me , i can make it go slow or fast , however i please , ' she says			0
' that ’s how i know it does n't exist			0
' and despite only being fourteen years old , @entity11 already misses her days as a newborn			1
' when they ’re in the stomach , [ babies are ] so aware , putting all their bones together , putting all their ligaments together			0
but they ’re shocked by this harsh world … as they grow up , they start losing			0
' discussing honesty , @entity11 goes on to suggest that she has started ' caring less and less about what your own mind thinks ' in a bid to stop her feeling sad			1
@entity13 agrees by saying : ' exactly			0
because your mind has a duality to it			0
so when one thought goes into your mind , it ’s not just one thought , it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain			0
