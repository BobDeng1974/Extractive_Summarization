by @entity0 people living in areas where water fluoridation schemes are in place are less likely to have tooth decay than those in other regions , according to a @entity9 fluoride in tap water can reduce the chance of getting tooth decay and improve overall dental health , a new report has revealed			1
people living in areas where water fluoridation schemes are in place are less likely to have tooth decay than those in other regions , according to a @entity9 ( @entity10 ) report			1
experts said there are ‘ significant benefits ’ of the schemes after compiling the first national report on the measure			1
during the early 20th century lower levels of tooth decay were noted in places which had certain fluoride levels in drinking water			1
over the last 50 years , schemes have been put in place in various places across @entity9 to adjust the levels of the mineral in water supplies to mimic the effect			0
in @entity9 , 14 out of 152 local authorities have water fluoridation schemes in place - covering six million people			1
in these areas the level of fluoride in the water is adjusted to one part per million			0
in the latest report , experts measured the dental health of five - year - olds with baby teeth and 12 - year - olds with adult teeth from both fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas			1
on average , 15 % fewer five - year - olds had tooth decay that needed intervention in fluoridated areas , the authors said			1
and when deprivation and ethnicity - both important factors for dental health - were taken into account this figure rose to 28 % fewer cases of tooth decay			1
the report also revealed there were 11 % fewer 12 - year - olds with tooth decay in fluoridated areas compared to non-fluoridated areas			1
this figure rose to 21 % when deprivation and ethnicity were taken into account , the authors said			0
and in areas which participate in the water adjustment scheme there were 45 % fewer hospital admissions for tooth decay among children aged one to four			2
experts also found that the population rates of kidney stones and bladder cancer were lower in fluoridated areas			2
while the findings are only a crude analysis , the authors found that kidney stones episodes were 5.3 % lower in fluoridated areas and rates of bladder cancer were 4.4 % lower in fluoridated areas compared to non-fluoridated places			2
but they said more research was needed to assess these findings			0
a previous study has linked fluoridation to dental fluorosis - where white flecks are seen on the teeth			0
the research compared rates of the effect on fluoridated @entity101 and non-fluoridated @entity102			0
they found that the number of 12 - year - old children in @entity101 with moderate dental fluorosis was around 1 % compared to 0.2 % in @entity102			0
but the authors said the overall dental benefit of the schemes were ‘ important ’			0
exerts found that on average 15 % fewer five - year - olds had tooth decay that needed intervention in fluoridated areas than those living in non-fluoridated areas ( picture posed by model , file picture ) ‘ tooth decay is a significant public health problem in @entity9 , ’ the report states			1
‘ sizeable inequalities exist between affluent and deprived communities , and it is a common cause of hospital admissions in children			0
’ professor @entity126 , chief knowledge officer at @entity10 , said : ‘ there is a good deal of speculation about water fluoridation schemes			2
this report provides new data which is direct evidence of the safety and efficacy of water fluoridation in @entity9			2
‘ there is no evidence of any effect on general health in fluoridated areas compared to non-fluoridated areas			0
there are important benefits in terms of dental health - it does look as if there are really significant benefits in those areas that have water fluoridation schemes			1
‘ we will use this report as a basis for discussions with local authorities on the scope and content of further reports and on the role of fluoridation as a public health measure			0
’ @entity162 , director of dental public health at @entity10 , added : ‘ these findings highlight the important contribution that water fluoridation makes to children 's dental health and general well - being			1
‘ it is notable that the benefits of this public health measure appear to be greatest for children living in the most deprived areas of the country			2
‘ this is significant for reducing the large differences we see in dental health between deprived and more affluent areas of the country			0

experts said there were ' significant benefits ' of water fluoridation schemes
@entity9 report found fluoride in water could lower tooth decay
study found children living in fluoridated areas had better dental health
