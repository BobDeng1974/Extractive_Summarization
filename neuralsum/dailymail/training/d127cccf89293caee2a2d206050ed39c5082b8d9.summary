by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ marthakelner @entity2 and @entity3 both won @entity5 gold to continue @entity6 ’s best ever start to a major athletics championships , a seven - medal haul with more likely in the coming days			1
‘ we ’re all feeding off each other , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ everyone ’s feeling positive			2
’ @entity12 won the 10,000 metres title just ahead of team - mate @entity14 to rescue a lacklustre season and emulate the success of @entity17 in the women ’s race on tuesday			1
@entity20 then won the 100m with a relieved @entity22 taking bronze			1
@entity3 cruised to victory in 10.06sec , a long way behind his personal best of 9.91 but enough to seal victory over @entity46 ’s @entity45 , who took silver			1
the @entity48 still acknowledged he will need to improve to challenge the @entity50 and @entity51 sprinters who dominate the world stage			0
‘ winning a medal is going to give me confidence but i ’m under no illusion that the guys out there are running 9.8 and 9.9 on a regular basis , ’ he said			0
‘ there is still work to be done			0
but if we rewind to february when i pulled my hamstring and my tendon , that was a down - point			1
i was n’t sure that i was going to be able to compete in the summer so this is a lovely feeling			0
’ @entity20 ’s title represents @entity6 ’s first individual sprint medal since @entity69 won gold at the @entity71 in @entity72 in 1998			1
the 26 - year - old had proved his durability by qualifying fastest in the semi-finals			2
@entity46 ’s @entity76 , the fastest man in @entity5 this season , did not make it to the start line , withdrawing with a knee injury			2
there had been hopeful suggestions that @entity20 might threaten @entity85 ’s @entity84 100m record of 9.87 , which has stood for 21 - years			1
the track at @entity36 ’s @entity88 stadium is famously quick , but the weather was not conducive to fast running			0
a vicious wind caused the meeting to be delayed by 30 minutes and a light rain began to fall just before the start			2
there was a further wait after @entity22 was shown a yellow card for a false start			1
flying the flag : @entity37 of @entity6 poses with a @entity100 after winning gold in @entity36 champion : @entity17 celebrates after winning her first career title at the age of 40 ‘ my spike dropped out of my shoe , which caused it , ’ said the south @entity105			1
‘ when i saw i was n’t ( disqualified ) i just said “ thank you lord ”			0
’ seconds later he was being confirmed as the bronze medallist in a photo - finish with @entity114			1
@entity22 sank to his knees with a beaming smile			1
the start had also not been one of @entity20 ’s best			2
‘ i just had to zone out and focus , ’ the new champion said			0
‘ i actually thought i had messed up my opportunity of even picking up a medal but once i got through my drive phase i was able to pull away and win			0
’ as for double @entity123 champion @entity12 , he is a long way from his best but gritted his teeth as he crossed the line to become @entity5 10,000m champion six weeks after dramatically collapsing at a training camp			0
@entity12 was forced to work hard in the final lap , grimacing as he powered down the home straight ahead of @entity6 team - mate @entity14 and two @entity133 athletes			1
the @entity12 showboating was saved until after victory was confirmed in 28min 8.11sec			2
then the @entity136 flowed and he was embraced by friend @entity137 , who was in @entity36 doing promotional work			0
it was no surprise @entity12 was below par — this is only his second race on the track in a year where he collapsed twice , came a disappointing eighth in the @entity145 and withdrew from the @entity146 because he was unfit			0
thumbs up : youngster @entity22 kept up the medal haul with bronze in the men 's 100m two champions : @entity137 was on hand to congratulate @entity12 after his victory @entity153 was perhaps best known previously for his @entity155 spat with @entity157 athlete @entity156 last week			1
he sniped at the 800m runner for boasting about buying a designer handbag after winning silver at the @entity146			0
@entity12 had sauntered off the start - line and remained at the back of the pack for two laps			1
one effortless kick and he had moved up to be second of 24 athletes after four circuits			0
he was , as @entity168 remarked , ‘ putting his comfortable coat on ’			0
after the year he ’s had , @entity12 needed a cushioned reintroduction to major competition on the track			2
he spoke earlier this week of his latest collapse 40 days ago when he lost consciousness in his bathroom after a training run in @entity178 , @entity179			0
‘ it ’s been a hard time for me , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve still got four stitches in my ear from falling in the bathroom so to come out here and win meant more than anything else in the world			0
’ ‘ this one meant a lot to me , ’ he said			0
‘ two weeks ago there was doubt i was going to compete here after i pulled out of the @entity146			0
i wanted this title more badly because of that			2
’ he was followed home by @entity14 , who chased down @entity133 ’s @entity196 and dipped on the line to clinch the silver in 28:08.66			1
triumph : @entity12 crosses the line to take gold with @entity153 just behind him in a @entity84 one - two medallists : @entity153 and @entity12 pose together for the cameras after taking the top two medals @entity205 not important for @entity207 - @entity206			1

@entity3 cruised to victory in the men 's 100m with a time of 10.06sec
@entity2 won the 10,000 metres title just ahead of team - mate @entity14
@entity37 also won gold in the women 's 100m hurdles
@entity22 continued the haul with bronze in the men 's 100m
