by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity3 reporter published : 15:09 est , 12 august 2012 updated : 20:26 est , 13 august 2012 after releasing exciting images of @entity7 , @entity5 's curiosity rover is undergoing a crucial four day ‘ brain transplant ’			1
engineers were today continuing to update the rover ’s software which is currently in its flight stage to prepare it for its further missions on @entity7 , @entity5 said			1
today @entity5 released the first high resolution @entity14 from the craft			2
' the images show a landscape that closely resembles portions of the southwestern @entity31 in its morphology , adding to the impression gained from the lower - resolution thumbnail mosaic released early in the week , ' said a @entity5 spokesman			0
' the colors in the main image are unmodified from those returned by the camera			0
' while it is difficult to say whether this is what a human eye would see , it is what a cell phone or camcorder would record since the @entity48 takes color pictures in the exact same manner that consumer cameras acquire color images			0
' the parts of this mosaic that are most interesting to geologists include a section on the crater wall north of the landing site where a network of valleys believed to have formed by water erosion enters @entity62 from the outside			0
they are also studying a section that looks south of the landing site that provides an overview of the eventual geological targets @entity21 will explore , including the rock - strewn , gravelly surface nearby , the dark dune field and the layered buttes and mesas of the sedimentary rock of @entity73 are also taking a close look at an area excavated by the blast of the @entity78 's descent stage rockets ( below )			1
with the loose debris blasted away by the rockets , details of the underlying materials are clearly seen			0
of particular note is a well - defined , topmost layer that contains fragments of rock embedded in finer material			0
during the software update , engineers will add two crucial functions to @entity21 – the ability to drive over the planet ’s rocky terrain and the ability to use the geochemistry lab ’s sampling system			1
new images from @entity5 's @entity21 rover shows an area excavated by the blast of the @entity78 's descent stage rocket engines the team also today received a call from the president congratulating them			1
' it 's inspiring to all of us , ' he said			0
' photographs that are coming back are going to be remarkable and amazing , ' president @entity110 said			1
' through your dedicated effort , @entity21 stuck her landing and captured the attention and imagination of millions of people , ' he said , using the gymnastics term the day after the @entity120 wrapped up in @entity121			2
' it 's really mind - boggling what you 've been able to accomplish , and being able to get that whole landing sequence to work the way you did is a testimony to your team , ' @entity110 said stunning : @entity5 's curiosity rover released its first colour landscape pictures from @entity7 on thursday			1
the view shows the mountains looming in the distance brain transplant : engineers are performing a four day software update on the @entity21 , pictured here showing the surface of @entity7 a handout photo provided by @entity140 @entity5 on 09 august 2012 shows the first 360 - degree panorama in color of the @entity62 landing site taken by @entity5 's curiosity rover on friday , engineers detailed how @entity21 landed approximately 1.5 miles from its predicted touchdown spot			1
the excellent panoramic images , released on thursday , were the first colour landscape photographs provided from the $ 2.5 billion @entity7 rover and were taken with the probe 's @entity149 which extend above the spacecraft			2
the panoramic mosaic , comprising 130 separate images that @entity21 captured with its newly activated navigation cameras , shows a rust - colored , pebble - strewn expanse stretching to a wall of the crater 's rim in one direction and a tall mound of layered rock in another			2
that formation , named @entity164 , stands at the center of the vast , ancient impact crater and several miles from where @entity21 touched down at the end of an eight - month voyage across 352 million mile ( 566 million km ) of space			0
the layers of exposed rock are thought to hold a wealth of @entity7 ' geologic history , making it the main target of exploration for scientists who will use the rover to seek evidence of whether the planet most similar to @entity181 might now harbor or once have hosted key ingredients for microbial life			2
@entity5 also revealed a new colour corrected picture of the area the rover landed , clearly showing the rocks and other debris the mission controllers also released the rover 's first self - portrait which was stitched together to show an uninterrupted view of @entity21 standing on the surface of the @entity7			1
eight shots were used to create the panoramic picture using the rover 's twin navigation cameras , or @entity199 which are used to capture 3d images			0
the @entity7 : the rover uses twin navigation cameras , known as @entity199 , to take the incredible images showing the planet 's rust - coloured , pebble - strewn terrain the 360 - degree panorama was created by @entity5 staff by electronically stitching together eight shots from the rover @entity210 , principal investigator , @entity211 , watches the amazing panoramic image being built up on screen the new also reveal more about @entity21 's arrival on the red planet			1
blast marks from the rocket engine 's that brought the car sized rover can clearly be seen in the image below , which forms part of the panorama			1
scientists believe that the soil on mars is relatively shallow , which will help @entity21 's instruments get access to the underlying rock easily			1
' these @entity199 images indicate that our powered descent stage did more than give us a great ride , it gave our science team an amazing freebie , ' said @entity236 , project scientist for the mission from the @entity238 in @entity239			0
' the thrust from the rockets actually dug a one - and - a - half - foot - long [ 0.5 meter ] trench in the surface			0
' it appears we can see @entity7 bedrock on the bottom			0
its depth below the surface is valuable data we can use going forward			0
' the panorama reveals dark marks on the surface caused tby the lander 's rocket engines as it descended @entity5 has also released more self portraits taken by the rover , which they have been using to check for signs of damage			1
visible in the photograph are pebbles resting on the top of the craft which have been kicked up by the landing of the multi-billion dollar exploration vehicle			0
however , mission controllers believe the craft is , so far , responding perfectly to their commands			0
a handout photo provided by @entity270 @entity5 on 09 august 2012 shows full - resolution self - portrait of the deck of @entity5 's @entity21 from the rover 's navigation cameras			1
pebbles are visible on the top part of the deck of @entity5 's @entity21 on @entity7 , taken from one of the rover 's navigation cameras looking toward the back left of the rover but mission controllers at the @entity284 near @entity285 are exercising caution immediately following @entity21 's jarring , death - defying descent to the surface on sunday night			1
they plan to spend weeks putting the nuclear - powered , six - wheeled rover and its sophisticated array of instruments through a painstaking series of ' health ' checks before embarking on the thrust of their science mission in earnest			0
the $ 2.5 billion curiosity project , formally named the @entity78 , is @entity5 's first astrobiology mission since the @entity304 probes of the 1970s and is touted as the first fully equipped mobile geochemistry lab ever sent to a distant world			0
@entity181 - like landscape : this image released by @entity5 and taken by cameras aboard the @entity21 rover shows the @entity7 horizon scientists say resembles the @entity312 comparing : the @entity312 stretches throughout southeastern and central @entity313 as well as southern @entity314 , southwestern @entity315 and northwestern @entity316 , in the @entity31 a strange blob is visible on the left conspiracy theorists have already worked themselves up into a lather over a mysterious blotch visible in the first black and white photographs taken from @entity5 's new @entity21 as it landed on @entity7			1
however , two hours later when the satellite made another pass over @entity21 , the rover sent another batch of images that revealed that the blotch had disappeared			2
after three full days on the @entity7 , ' @entity21 continues to behave flawlessly ' and has ' executed all planned activities ' without a hitch , mission manager @entity328 said at a @entity284 news briefing			2
the latest round of equipment checks included an instrument designed to determine mineral composition of powdered rock and soil samples ; one to analyze soil and atmospheric samples for organic compounds ; one to detect traces of water locked in shallow mineral deposits ; and another that uses particle x-rays to identify chemical elements in rocks and soils			0
the very delivery of @entity21 to the surface of @entity7 already has been hailed by @entity5 as the greatest feat of robotic spaceflight			1
the car - sized rover , which flew from @entity181 encased in a protective capsule , blasted into the @entity7 sky at hypersonic speed and landed safely seven minutes later after an elaborate , daredevil descent combining a giant parachute with a rocket - pack that lowered the rover to the @entity7 surface on a tether			2
since then , the rover has been sending a string of early images back to @entity181 , relayed by two @entity5 satellites orbiting @entity7 , providing glimpses of a terrain that scientists say appear reminiscent of the @entity312 in @entity313			1
one shot beamed back late wednesday night , the first taken by @entity21 of itself , shows the rover 's top deck strewn with dark pebbles apparently kicked up from the ground when the craft landed			2
@entity5 scientists said the gravel does not appear to pose any risk to instruments on the vehicle			0
two separate high - resolution ' @entity199 ' images taken of the surface show that thrust from the sky - crane rockets during descent carved out a 1.5 - foot ( 0.5 - meter ) trench in the surface , exposing what appears to be @entity7 bedrock underneath			1
when @entity21 wakes up for its fourth day on @entity7 , early friday @entity313 time , mission controllers plan to conduct additional instrument checks and prepare the craft for an upgrade of its main computer software for surface operations			1
all other activities will be suspended during that upgrade , which will begin on day 5 of the mission and last four days			0
