by @entity1 reporter published : 15:59 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 16:10 est , 3 october 2013 a @entity3 man has been accused of an horrific act of animal cruelty after posting a picture on @entity7 apparently showing him torturing a mouse that he claims ate his wages			1
the picture , posted by a @entity7 user from @entity12 , shows the mouse suspended by its legs with rope from a ladder			1
it has been claimed that the man was punishing the mouse for destroying two bank notes worth 200 @entity20 @entity19 ( around £ 35 ) that were in his closet			1
cruel : a picture posted by a @entity3 man on @entity7 appears to show a mouse being tortured after it ate his wages the man said that he had just been handed his weekly wage and hid it in the cupboard for safe keeping			1
but many people are claiming that the picture and the @entity3 man 's story is a fake and that it appeared on several other websites as a joke earlier in the year			2
nevertheless the image provoked a strong reaction when it was picked up by the @entity38 website , with most readers appalled at the man 's actions			0
one reader from the @entity43 posted on the site : ' as desperate as the man must be to lose his money , torturing a helpless animal is not a good thing to do and not a solution			2
' another mouse may come and what will he do then ? repeat this stupid act ! ? ! ' fake ? the man also posted a picture of the two notes that he claims were destroyed by the mouse but some questioned the outraged response of others claiming that people were more concerned about the mouse 's fate than the plight of the @entity3 people			1

the personal trainer said on camera the mouse would be ' terminated with @entity81 of @entity82 ' as he tortured and eventually killed it			0
but he was arrested when he sent the footage to a friend who was so disturbed by what she saw that she called the @entity87			0
he was given a 12 week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a two - year ban from owning animals .			0
