by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 6 october 2013 she is three months pregnant and happily settled , but love life was n't always so blissful for @entity3			1
the model , 30 , has gone from strength to strength since she survived an horrific acid attack arranged by her ex-boyfriend @entity8 in 2008			1
but she reveals getting back into dating after the ordeal was ' awful '			2
' when i started dating again , it was like being 13 or 14 because i 'd forgotten - should you kiss on a date ? what do you wear ? when do you text back ? do you have to pretend you do n't like someone when you do ? ' blooming lovely : @entity3 at @entity17 at @entity18 in @entity19 this week in a frank interview with the @entity22 's fabulous magazine , @entity3 said while all her friends were starting to settle down she was ' feeling very insecure ' and ' getting it all wrong '			1
' there were people i thought liked me who actually did n't , people who maybe just felt sorry for me or wanted to go on dates with me to ask me about the tv show rather than because they fancied me ... when i got rejected , instead of thinking " oh well " i 'd take it really badly			1
it was like being a little girl with no experience , ' she said			0
@entity3 is now coupled up with her boyfriend of 18 months , whom she keeps out of the limelight			1
they are expecting their first child together			0
she said : ' i 'm in love			0
with my boyfriend , it was never an issue or a big conversation			0
he would 've known the news story about the girl who had acid thrown in her face , but he did n't know the ins and outs ... it was me who brought it up in the end			1
' through the other side : she reveals after an ' awful ' time getting back into dating , she 's settled in may 2009 , @entity8 and @entity59 were told by the judge that they were ' the face of pure evil '			2
both were jailed for life and @entity8 will serve a minimum of 16 years			1
despite scarring her physically for life , the model from @entity68 , @entity69 , has enjoyed a successful career as a charity campaigner , presenter and spokesperson in the five years since suffering the life - changing event			1
@entity3 announced just a fortnight ago that she was ' beaming ' after going to her 12 - week scan last week , described the news of her pregnancy as ' beyond incredible '			2
speaking of the happy news : ' i 've always known that i have wanted children but there were moments after what happened to me that i never thought this would happen , i never believed this would be my future			2
' it 's beyond incredible , ' she said , speaking to the @entity91			0
' it 's because i 'm so happy about it that it 's been so hard keeping quiet and i 'm actually relieved to be able to tell everyone			0
' fans quickly reacted to the good news on @entity98 , prompting @entity3 to reply she has been ' overwhelmed by all the congratulations tweets and best wishes ! thank you so much has completely taken my mind of todays morning sickness ! @entity104 ' campaigner : @entity3 is part of a groundbreaking @entity108 ad campaign including a new short film the good news is a far cry from her her distressing experience five years ago , when violent ex-boyfriend @entity8 raped @entity3 and held her captive in a @entity19 hotel for eight hours			1
but his revenge for being rejected seemingly knew no bounds and two days later , under his direction , accomplice @entity59 threw a cup of industrial - strength sulphuric acid in her face			0
the attack on a @entity19 street melted her face , blinded her in one eye and left her with horrific burns			0
rushed to the burns unit of @entity128 and @entity129 , @entity3 was showered with tap water for ten hours as medics fought to neutralise the effect of the acid on her skin and prevent further damage			1
eye drops were also administered every few minutes to try to wash the acid away			0
but her injuries were unimaginable			0
the left side of @entity3 's face was burned away to the fat layer - the only thing beyond it was muscle and bone			2
she lost the sight in her left eye and acid also dripped down her neck , ears and hands as well as slipping into her nose and throat , with further terrible consequences			0
before and after : @entity3 had been an aspiring model before the attack in 2008 , which left her with horrific burns for more than a year she had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and surgery to dilate her oesophagus			1
in total , she has endured more than 40 operations since the attack			0
as well as the physical damage , the attack left @entity3 fearful of going out in public and her self - esteem was at had all time low as she hated seeing her scarred face , which she had to cover with a protective mask for two years			1
@entity3 has since won widespread support for her series of thought - provoking documentaries for @entity173 , written three books about her experience and has won awards - including @entity177 in 2011 and a @entity178			2
she has also set up her own charity , the @entity180 , to help other burn victims receive medical and emotional support			0
@entity3 is also now one of the new stars of the @entity108 campaign , appearing alongside actress @entity185 and @entity187 female boxing champion @entity186 .			2
