the note , from march 1975 , read : ' this is me , but i do n't know who the girl on the back is - she is somebody we just picked up at a bus - stop			2
' when they turned over the paper , they saw a beguiling portrait of a young woman with a fashionable haircut looking off to her right			2
scandal : @entity20 was forced to resign from the @entity80 after it emerged he was sleeping with ms @entity12 in ms @entity12 's autobiography , @entity81 , she says that @entity60 had asked her to find girls to attend a party in 1961 at his house on the @entity87 estate , owned by the aristocratic @entity89 family			1
' driving past @entity91 airport we offered a lift to a girl waiting at the bus stop , ' she wrote			0
' she seemed nice , so we invited her to the party at @entity60 's cottage			2
' that party turned out to be the start of the affair between @entity9 , then the secretary of state for war , and ms @entity12 , a showgirl 27 years his junior			1
the @entity105 mp walked in on @entity60 , ms @entity12 and their unknown new friend in the swimming pool , and chased the model around when she was wearing nothing but a towel			1
all this must have been witnessed by the woman , who could also have met distinguished guests at the estate such as @entity116 , then the president of @entity117			2

the @entity132 minister was 27 years older than his lover , and was married to actress @entity134			0
