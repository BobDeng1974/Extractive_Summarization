mathematicians have confirmed what fans of @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 may already suspect – that @entity7 song lyrics are one of the most depressing forms of writing on the planet			1
a study has found that @entity7 - spoken song lyrics are more miserable than @entity14 literature , which has brought us less - than - cheery classic novels such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
only @entity20 novels and @entity22 film subtitles – which can be full of violence and gothic themes – were ranked less happy than @entity7 song lyrics			1
a study has found that @entity7 song lyrics are less positive than @entity14 literature , making them one of the most miserable forms of writing analysed in a new study			1
a stock image of @entity32 from @entity3 is shown , whose lyrics include , ' if you 'd been a dog they would have drowned you at birth ' a random sample of @entity7 language lyrics ranked 22nd for ‘ happiness ’ out of 24 categories in different languages			2
however , overall , the study concluded that human language as a whole is positive			0
in 1969 , two psychologists proposed the @entity45 - the idea that there is a universal human tendency to use positive words more frequently than negative ones , so that humans think , and talk , on the bright side of life			2
since then , scientists have investigated whether the idea is true			0
only @entity20 novels and @entity22 film subtitles – which can be full of violence and gothic themes – were ranked less happy than @entity7 song lyrics ( shown above )			1
@entity59 was found to be the happiest language , with its @entity62 searches ranking the most positive in terms of words analysed despite noting the unhappiness of @entity7 pop lyrics , overall , the study concluded that human language as a whole is positive			1
@entity70 's first album was titled ' born to die ' a team of scientists at the @entity73 used a vast data set made up of many billions of words to confirm the 1960s guess			0
they gathered billions of words from around the world using 24 types of sources including books , news outlets , social media , websites , television and film subtitles , and music lyrics			1
mathematician @entity89 said : ' we collected roughly 100 billion words written in tweets			0
' from these sources , the team then identified about 10,000 of the most frequently used words in each of 10 languages including @entity7 , @entity59 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity100 @entity99 , @entity22 , @entity20 , @entity14 , @entity101 and @entity102			1
analysing a random sample of words from @entity102 film subtitles , @entity109 feeds in @entity22 , the famously dark literature of @entity114 , books in @entity105 , music lyrics in @entity7 , and even the war - torn pages of the @entity108 , they found the types of writing – and probably all human language , is skewed towards the use of happy words			1
the study found that @entity7 song lyrics are less positive than @entity14 literature , which has brought us less - than - cheery novels such as @entity17 ( a screen shot from the film starring @entity127 is shown left ) and @entity18 ( right ) , capable of draining the most optimistic person of happiness the team of researchers studied 100,000 words across 10 languages ( a yellow box indicates the row language is more positive than the column language , and a blue background shows the reverse ) @entity59 was the happiest ( pictured ) and @entity105 was the most negatively skewed a random sample of @entity7 language lyrics ranked 22nd for ‘ happiness ’ out of 24 categories in different languages , but overall , the study concluded that human language is positive			1
the @entity145 are known for their less than uplifting songs such as ' @entity148 knows i 'm miserable now ' and ' what difference does it make ' mathematician and co-leader of the study , @entity153 looked at 10 languages and found ‘ in every source we looked at , people use more positive words than negative ones			1
’ despite violent films and miserable song lyrics , he said that ‘ positive social interaction ’ is built into global languages ’ fundamental structure			2
the scientists also asked native speakers of the languages to rate words according to how positive or negative they find them			0
the results were published in the journal @entity169			0
@entity105 from these speakers , they gathered five million individual human scores of the words , with laughter scoring 8.5 , for example , and terrorist , 1.3			0
once all of these words were plotted , the researchers found that every language studied was inherently positive , and more words scored higher than five			2
over all , @entity59 was found to be the happiest language , and @entity7 took third place , behind @entity99			1
a search of @entity20 books had the lowest ‘ average word happiness , ’ but all 24 sources of words scored on average above the average happiness score of five , including song lyrics			2
when the team translated words between languages and then back again they found that ‘ the estimated emotional content of words is consistent between languages			0
’ ‘ using human evaluation of 100,000 words spread across 10 languages diverse in origin and culture , we present evidence of a deep imprint of human sociality in language , ’ the mathematicians wrote in the study			2
‘ the words of natural human language possess a universal positivity bias , the estimated emotional content of words is consistent between languages under translation , and this positivity bias is strongly independent of frequency of word use			0
' the scientists also built a computer programme called the hedometer , which was named after the @entity222 words for pleasure and gauge , to track levels of happiness in language over time , for example on @entity109			0
they found that over the past year , @entity7 speaking @entity109 users used the most positive language on christmas day , @entity231 and @entity232 , and used the most unhappy language to talk about the death of @entity235 , @entity237 attacks and the @entity239 protests			0
the tool was also used to analyse the high and low points of 10,000 books to show that @entity243 is an emotionally turbulent novel and that the @entity245 ends on a jubilant note			0
language used in @entity18 was predominantly positive but ended on a very low point .			0

mathematicians from @entity73 analysed happiness of words
they found that @entity7 song lyrics are less positive than @entity14 literature , but cheerier than @entity22 film subtitles
mathematicians found that in the 10 languages studied , including @entity7 , people use more positive words than negative ones
@entity59 was found to be the happiest language , followed by @entity99
