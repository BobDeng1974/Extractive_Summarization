by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:23 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 23 september 2013 @entity3 chancellor @entity2 won an historic third term in power this evening - making her the only @entity7 leader not to become a casualty of @entity7 ’s financial crisis			1
official results have now confirmed that chancellor @entity2 's conservatives won @entity3 's election with 41.5 per cent of the vote but indicate that they have finished short of an absolute majority			1
its coalition partners , the pro-business @entity16 , slumped to 4.8 percent - not enough to win seats			2
@entity20 's @entity19 won 25.7 percent , their @entity22 allies 8.4 percent and the hard - line @entity23 8.6 percent			1
the likeliest outcome for coalition is with the @entity19			2
win : chancellor and leader of @entity29 ( @entity29 ) @entity2 has won a third term in office victory : general secretary @entity33 congratulates the chancellor after exit polls broadcast on @entity3 television showed @entity2 's @entity29 had won 42 per cent of the vote all smiles : @entity2 told her supporters this evening that the result was ' super ' and that they should ' celebrate ' exit poll figures released on @entity3 television shows the @entity29 and @entity42 have won 42.5 per cent of the vote speaking earlier this evening , the chancellor , 59 , said it was too early to discuss plans for the next government			1
@entity2 said : ' i see the next four years in front of me and i can promise that we will face many tasks , at home , in @entity7 and in the world			2
' we will do all we can in the next four years together to make them successful years for @entity3			0
' it is too early to say how we will proceed but today we should celebrate			0
' the result is an improvement of more than eight points on the last election in 2009			0
the @entity29 's strong showing was also personal victory for @entity2 , who has held the position since 2005 , solidifying her position as arguably @entity7 's strongest political leader			2
victory at the polls was tempered by a disastrous showing from the liberal @entity68 ( @entity68 ) - @entity2 's current junior coalition party - which only won 4.8 per cent of the vote			1
it means they can not rule for a second term in power with the incumbent chancellor			0
the result could see the center - right party face an embarrassing ejection from parliament also			0
the exit polls were greeted by shocked silence by the @entity16 ' at their election event			0
four years ago , the party won nearly 15 percent of the vote , its best - ever result - but the party has taken much of the blame for squabbling in @entity2 's governing coalition since then			1
@entity88 : supporters of @entity2 's party celebrate at @entity29 headquarters as the first exit polls are published @entity2 's supporters were elated at the result , which sees the chancellor remain in power for a third term ' it 's the bitterest , saddest hour of the @entity68 , ' the party 's leader , vice chancellor @entity98 , said			1
the chancellor will now most likely join with the centre - left @entity102 ( @entity102 ) – the equivalent to the @entity99 - which is opposed to many of her conservative principles and policies			1
@entity109 , leader of the @entity102 , came in second place on around 26 percent			2
speaking this evening , @entity109 said : ' we did not achieve the result we wanted			2
' the ball is in @entity2 's court			0
she has to get herself a majority			0
' according to media reports , @entity102 leader @entity109 was already resigned to being mrs. @entity2 ’s understudy for the next four years as the junior partner in a coalition before voting started today			1
good result : @entity2 's supporters continued to celebrate after the result was announced @entity2 's @entity29 was favourite to win the election , following an upbeat campaign focusing on the party 's successes over the past two terms the @entity102 was @entity2 's coaltion partner in her first term			1
both parties are committed to saving the euro and to the ' @entity135 ' - small - to - medium - sized businesses that form the backbone of the export led economy			0
however , the @entity102 is a party of higher taxes , minimum wages and workers ' rights , limited military involvement abroad and a host of neo-liberal family policies certain to rub against mrs. @entity2 's avowed intent to carry on down the path of austerity			1
@entity149 , managing director of the pollster @entity150 said : ' there are many within the @entity102 who oppose the idea of going into a grand coalition with @entity2 ’s bloc			2
' he added that many want assurances they will not merely be @entity2 ” s ' @entity159 ' at her beck and call for the next four years			0
bad news : free @entity163 ( @entity68 ) supporters looked stunned as it is announced their party will no longer be in coalition with the @entity29 after winning just 4.5 per cent of the vote second place : @entity170 ( @entity102 ) party candidate @entity109 waves to supporters after learning his party came second with 26 per cent of the vote			1
he is most likely to enter into coalition with @entity2 supporters of the @entity102 celebrate winning 26 per cent of the vote elsewhere , the alternative for @entity178 – which is opposed to the euro – scored just four percent , a whole per cent less than the total needed to get into parliament			1
the hard - left @entity183 won five percent , and the @entity184 scored nine percent , but neither have enough votes to form a government with the @entity102			1
there was a poor showing for the @entity190 party which also failed to gain enough votes to get into parliament for the first time			0
early indications pointed to a higher turnout than four years ago , election officials said - with 41.4 per cent of eligible voters casting their ballots by 2pm , four hours before polling stations closed			0
that compared with 36.1 per cent at the same point in 2009			0
leaders of @entity203 @entity202 and @entity204 at the exit poll announcement this evening results : supporters of the left - wing " @entity203 " , who received 5 per cent of the vote , gather for the exit poll announcement at the party headquarters this evening the coming hours and days will see a frantic round of negotiations between the @entity29 and the @entity102 as they carve up ministries and posts to satisfy all sides in their respective parties			1
after leading @entity3 through the economic crisis , mrs. @entity2 went into the race for power more popular than ever - portraying herself as a safe pair of hands as the crisis claimed leaders in @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229			0
pre-polls gave @entity2 popularity ratings of about 70 per cent			0
supporters of the @entity184 celebrate the result at the party headquarters before voting today , @entity2 called her current coalition ' the most successful government since reunification ' 23 years ago			1
she pointed to the robust economy and unemployment which , at 6.8 per cent , is very low for @entity3 and far below that of many other @entity7 countries			0
@entity3 's first post-war chancellor , conservative @entity242 , won the only single - party majority so far in 1957			2
he formed a coalition with a smaller party anyway , but the @entity29 governed on its own from mid- 1960 to late 1961 after most of that party 's lawmakers defected to it			2
votes : merkel and her husband @entity250 cast their ballots			0

@entity2 wins third term , emulating @entity257 's @entity256
her @entity29 ( @entity29 ) and sister party @entity42 ( @entity42 ) won 41.5 per cent of the vote
' this is a super result . we must celebrate , ' @entity2 said this evening
@entity68 ( @entity264 ) , which @entity2 ruled with for the four years , has disastrous result with just 4.8 per cent
@entity267 can not *co-rule* for a second term
centre - left rival @entity109 of @entity19 ( @entity102 ) got 25.7 per cent of the vote and is most likely to enter into coalition with chancellor
