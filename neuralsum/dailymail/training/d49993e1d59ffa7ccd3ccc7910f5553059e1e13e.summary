by @entity0 and @entity1 on the rolling greens of the genteel @entity5 golf club , the talk is usually of turf and tees			0
that is , until it was rocked by allegations of inappropriate behaviour between married members – and claims of an ‘ @entity14 ’ at the helm			0
that is the damning judgment of an employment tribunal , which accused the club of conducting a ‘ witch hunt ’ against a well - regarded employee , and ordered it to pay £ 50,000 in compensation			1
victim : @entity23 ( left ) was sacked after raising concerns about the relationship between a golf club secretary and a married female member			1
@entity28 ( right ) refutes allegations of inappropriate behaviour it labelled club secretary @entity28 an ‘ overbearing and aggressive			2
ayatollah ’ , while former club captain @entity32 was branded ‘ ignorant and naive ’			0
the trouble started when rumours swept the club that ‘ something happened ’ between mr @entity28 , 69 , and a married member , @entity37 , 73 , at a party			2
days later , assistant secretary @entity23 claimed to have seen mrs @entity37 – who is married to @entity40 , 81 – pinching mr @entity28 ’s bottom			1
her submission stated that mrs @entity37 told him : ‘ @entity45 , everyone loved the barbecue and i loved squeezing your bottom			2
let me squeeze it again			0
’ mrs @entity23 , 58 , quietly discussed the incident and its impact on the 130 - year - old @entity53 club with senior members			1
but when details leaked out , she was escorted from the premises – and two months later , dismissed			2
mrs @entity23 , who was given the compensation for unfair dismissal , yesterday said she was pleased at the outcome but had been through a ‘ terrible ordeal ’			1
‘ i ’m not jumping for joy – i would rather have kept my job			0
but here we are and at least justice has been done , ’ she said			0
mrs @entity23 had worked at the club – @entity67 ’s second oldest heath course – since may 2008 and received no complaints until mr @entity28 took over in april 2012			1
within weeks she felt ‘ criticised and bullied ’ , and in june 2012 was given a written warning to turn around her performance			0
she went to then club captain mr @entity32 and made a formal complaint			0
the tribunal in @entity73 heard that he replied : ‘ i do not regard @entity28 ’s behaviour to you as bullying and there has been no physical violence			2
’ scandal : mrs @entity23 was escorted from @entity81 in @entity53 and later sacked after she said she saw @entity28 have his bottom squeezed by a female member , a tribunal found mrs @entity23 was later accused of making ‘ unprofessional and unfounded remarks ’ and ‘ escorted ’ from the £ 1,000 - a - year club			1
she was sacked in october 2012			0
the tribunal heard mr @entity28 and @entity87 ‘ categorically , vehemently and consistently ’ deny acting inappropriately			2
the club accused mrs @entity23 of spreading rumours to discredit her boss			1
but employment judge @entity91 said its investigation was ‘ one - sided ’ and its findings ‘ irrational and unreasonable ’			0
it was ‘ not unreasonable ’ for mrs @entity23 , a mother of one who is married to solicitor @entity97 , 68 , to raise concerns about rumours of inappropriate behaviour being ‘ openly discussed within the club ’ – particularly as similar allegations had engulfed a previous secretary			1
judge @entity91 added : ‘ one can not get away from the feeling that the claimant was the victim of nothing short of a witch hunt			1
’ mrs @entity37 , who runs a guest house in @entity5 , last night insisted the claims were ‘ made up ’			0
she said : ‘ a new club secretary arrived with a new way of doing things and she did n’t like it			0
her husband is involved with the law and perhaps she saw a way to make some money			0
’ mr @entity28 could not be contacted but the club said it had ‘ full confidence ’ in him			2
captain @entity120 said the tribunal was ‘ disappointing ’ , adding : ‘ the club refutes claims over secretary @entity28 ’s behaviour , which was fully investigated at the time			1
’ hearing : a judge at a tribunal in @entity73 said that mrs @entity23 had been the victim of a ' witch hunt '			1

@entity23 victim of ' witch hunt ' at @entity81 , @entity53
told captain about @entity28 *'s* alleged relationship with married woman
*grandmother* also claimed she saw him have his bottom squeezed in office
mrs @entity23 was escorted from premises and sacked two months later
employment tribunal finds in her *favour* and awards £ 50,000 compensation
