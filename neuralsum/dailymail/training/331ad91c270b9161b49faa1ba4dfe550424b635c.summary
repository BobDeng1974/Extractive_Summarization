10 ) @entity41 ( @entity42 , £ 9.8m ) - appears in 22.31 % of teams the @entity46 winger is lightning quick and extremely strong for his size , but most importantly he is a threat going forward			1

new arrival : @entity59 signed for @entity60 from @entity66 this summer and can excite the league dangerous : @entity59 ( left ) scored 19 goals and contributed 10 assists in @entity74 for @entity66 last year 8 ) @entity75 ( @entity24 , £ 3.2m ) - 22.95 % @entity75 's presence in the top 10 may surprise many but he is a bargain at £ 3.2m for a player who is likely to play week - in , week - out which itself brings points			1
he did not bag any goals or assists as a bit - part player for @entity86 last season , but as a man to put on the bench he is likely to accrue a few points if you are seriously struggling with injuries and suspensions			2
super sub : @entity24 's @entity75 is cheap and he offers a great option off the bench on @entity9 7 ) @entity95 ( @entity96 , £ 6.5m ) - 24.15 % no surprise at all to see @entity95 on this list as he is a one of those rare commodities - a defender who scores goal			1
the left - back takes penalties and free - kicks , meaning he contributed five goals and four assists last season			2
@entity96 keep a lot of clean sheets as well , so there 's extra points in the bag			0
essential : @entity95 is a must - have for any good @entity9 side because he scores from defence 6 ) @entity119 ( @entity120 , £ 11.0m ) - 24.17 % @entity120 's new signing excelled at @entity122 last season , scoring 27 goals as he led the underdogs to the @entity74 title			2

seven yellow cards is a slight blot on the copybook , though he is a centre - back after all			0
stalwart : @entity42 's @entity132 was extremely solid at the back for @entity134 last season 4 ) @entity152 ( @entity60 , £ 9.6m ) - 28.26 % the 23 - year - old had the season of his life last year - before injury cruelly curtailed it - and he netted an amazing 10 goals from midfield in 23 appearances			1
@entity152 also added eight assists , three @entity144 award and was booked just three times - if he stays fit he seems a perfect choice			0
form : @entity60 's @entity152 had the season of his life last season before getting injured useful : as a midfielder who scores goals - 10 last season - and contributes assists @entity152 is a good buy 3 ) @entity169 ( @entity42 , £ 10.4m ) - 31.36 % the @entity42 forward is just above @entity171 in the price - range for strikers and , after really coming of age last season , he can blossom this campaign as @entity177 ' main man following the departure of @entity179 to @entity66			1

a price - tag of £ 10.3m seems good value for a player who scored 17 goals and added 10 assists last season			1
he is the sixth most expensive striker , yet he has scored 83 @entity183 goals in the last four seasons for @entity86			0
yes , his eight bookings last season means he drops a point here and there for his ill - discipline , but he also won seven @entity144 awards and would be a great option as captain			0
captain material : new @entity193 skipper @entity171 has made his way on to second on the list @entity217 : a return of 17 goals and 10 assists last season means @entity171 is bound to bring in the points 1 ) @entity222 ( @entity96 , £ 7.1m ) - 32.77 % @entity96 and @entity46 's midfield sensation is a somewhat surprising name to be the most popular pick - although his price makes him a very attractive proposition			1

@entity222 is likely to mature further this season and become a key part of @entity244 's side , allowing him to accrue an even greater number of points			0
at just £ 7.1m he appears a snippet and that 's why a third of all teams have selected him			0
