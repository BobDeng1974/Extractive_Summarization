by @entity0 published : 05:57 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 12:32 est , 8 june 2012 professional mistress : @entity2 , 45 , says she would rather date married men			1
' @entity5 men in their 40s are single for a reason , ' she says she has been married herself - so knows what it is like to worry your partner might stray			1
but although divorced @entity2 , 45 , is back on the dating scene , she is determined she will only date men who are already married			1
the self - confessed serial mistress has had affairs with 50 married men over the past six years - and has no plans to change her habit			1
' married men are better trained , ' she said in an interview with the @entity20			1
' they have had all their rough edges sanded off by their wives and know how to behave around a lady			1
and married men are better in bed			1
' @entity2 says she has learned that a man who is still single into his 40s is single for a reason : either he has no social etiquette whatsoever or he ’s a player , just looking for his next wrestle			1
' a single guy i was on a date with licked his plate in a restaurant , ' she says			0
' a married man would never do that because his wife would knock his head off his shoulders			1
' @entity2 is one of a growing number of women signing up to @entity42 , a dating site for married people			1
women can join for free but men are charged £ 134 a month to find a mistress having consciously made a decision to have an affair			2
@entity2 justifies her behaviour by saying she does n't want to steal the husbands away from their wives - she simply wants to ' borrow ' them			1
' their wives should be grateful when it ’s me their husbands choose , ' she says			0
' i ’m the perfect mistress			0
i am never going to ask them to leave their wives for me			0
most mistresses do , but not me			0
if i asked him to leave his wife , in every argument from then on he would say : " do you know what i gave up for you ? " i do n’t ever want to be part of that			2
' in fact , when one of my men confessed about me to his wife and told me his marriage was over , i finished our affair			2
i do n’t want to steal someone ’s else husband for good , just borrow him for a while			2
' i know how to behave as a mistress – and i do n’t just mean in bed			2
i would never ring one of my married men at home at 2am or the weekend because that ’s their time with their family			1
' i would never throw a hissy fit if they do n’t spend @entity83 ’s , @entity84 or @entity85 with me			2
we both know exactly what the goalposts are			0
that ’s the beauty of it all			0
' @entity2 has been confronted by a couple of angry wives who suspected she was sleeping with their husbands			1
she insisted that she was merely friends with the men and stopped seeing them immediately			2
she feels no guilt about her behaviour because she says the men on the site have already made a conscious decision to have an affair before meeting her			2
' i am not the reason for their marital problems , ' she says			0
' also it costs so much to join , so you get a certain quality of man			0
' ' when one of my men confessed about me to his wife and told me his marriage was over , i finished our affair ' indeed , despite the current economic slump in the @entity116 , @entity42 have reported that business is booming – with the number of new members up by 27,000 in the last two months			2
experts say that that cheating websites are popular because many unhappily married couples simply can not afford to get divorced in the current economic climate			1
the stagnant housing market , growing family debt – up 58 per cent to an average of £ 9,314 per family this year – and the average cost of divorce - £ 13,000 – are forces behind the wide - spread shift to infidelity			2
many new @entity42 members stated on their application forms that they were joining because they were in unhappy marriages that they were unable to get out of in what is now a ‘ double - dip ’ recession			0
@entity42 spokesperson @entity138 said : ' many couples are now finding themselves trapped in unhappy marriages because they simply can not afford to divorce			0
' it ’s not just legal fees			0
it ’s the fact they ca n’t sell their houses since the market is so stagnant			0
worse , some are in a position of negative equity			0
a surprisingly high number of people who have recently joined have said that they count their marriages as over already and would have already got a divorce by now if they could only afford it			0
having an affair is treated almost as a practical , rather than a romantic , decision			0
' mistresses like @entity2 are reaping the benefit from this boom in cheating			1
@entity2 insists it is not money she is after			1
she makes her own living as a writer , and most of her relationships with men on @entity167 are nothing more than short flings			0
she says : ' when husbands are on loan to me they almost revert back to being in their 20s because that ’s often the last time they dated			0
we go to the theatre and do all the things married couple no longer do because they ’ve already done it			0
' i get the good bits of married men			1
during our time together , it ’s the wife who is the other woman			0
' @entity2 divorced her husband 11 years ago , but says she is happier flitting from one man to the next rather than finding mr @entity187			1
' i know married life is n’t for me			1
but i know that married men have the qualities i am looking for			1
