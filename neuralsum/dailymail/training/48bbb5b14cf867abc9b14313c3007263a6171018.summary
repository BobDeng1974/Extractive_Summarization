by @entity0 @entity1 used to despair over her excruciating migraines , which struck every other day			1
' i suffered from headaches since i was eight years old , ' says @entity1 , a retired court reporter from @entity6 , @entity7 , now in her 60s			1
' they were so overwhelmingly painful that i never fully engaged with people at work			1
i had a reputation for being quiet and moody , but , in fact , i was trying to cope with the pain in my head			1
' @entity1 uses a @entity17 ( @entity17 ) portable device to relieve her migraines for years , @entity1 relied on strong painkillers to cope , but worried about the long - term effects			1
however , more recently she 's been offered a new drug - free treatment which has reduced the severity of her migraines , and allowed her to cut back on her medication			1
@entity1 has been treated with trans - cranial magnetic stimulation , where magnetic pulses are directed into the head			1
doctors are unsure exactly how @entity17 works in treating migraine , but one theory is that it stops abnormal electrical activity in the brain			1
earlier this year , the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) said there is enough scientific evidence to support the use of the treatment for the prevention and treatment of migraine			1
migraines affect one in four women and one in 12 men in the @entity43			1
although the cause is not known , they involve sudden contraction and then dilation of blood vessels in the brain			2
unlike a normal headache , they are often accompanied by additional symptoms such as nausea , sensitivity to light , noise , touch and smell			2
they can also be preceded by aura , which can include flashing lights , zigzag lines in front of the eyes , and numbness or tingling in the limbs			2
pressing a button on the handle emits a single painless magnetic pulse for @entity1 , who sometimes felt nauseous when she had a migraine , standard painkillers had no effect			1
so she took the strongest medication , known as triptans , which work by causing the blood vessels around the brain to contract			2
but as she reached her mid- 50s , her headaches worsened , becoming more frequent and more severe , lasting two or three days at a time and often confining her to bed			2
if she was at work when a migraine hit , she would often have to rest in the sick room			2
and she was struggling with the side - effects of triptans , which can include nausea , a tight feeling in the chest and a ' spaced - out ' feeling			2
' it was like having a permanent headache - it was unbearable , ' she says			2
' i always carried my tablets with me			2
if i did n't take one i could n't function			2
i could n't take a day off work every time i had a headache or i 'd never have been there			2
' but the tablets made me feel as though i was walking in lead or wading through treacle			2
i had to take them so often that i was concerned what the long - term side - effects could be			2
' i tried acupuncture and head massage to try to cut down on the medication , but they did n't help			0
' in 2011 , @entity1 's gp referred her to a specialist headache clinic at @entity112 's @entity111 , where she was seen by consultant neurologist dr @entity113			1
she was prescribed various strong medications , including some usually used for treating epilepsy - thought to dampen down over-activity in the cells involved in generating migraine - but to no avail			0
then last june dr @entity113 suggested she tried tms			0
there are no known serious side - effects and the device is easy and safe to use , according to doctors			1
patients hold the portable device - which is about the weight of a brick and has a handle at each end - against their head at the base of the skull			1
pressing a button on the handle emits a single painless magnetic pulse			1
this passes through the skull at the back of the head and into the brain			0
the number , strength , frequency and duration of pulses can also be adjusted for each individual user			0
in a @entity148 clinical trial with 164 patients treated with @entity17 for at least one attack of migraine , 40 per cent were pain - free after two hours			1
after 24 hours , 29 per cent were still pain free , and after 48 hours 27 per cent were still pain free			0
the results were presented to a meeting of the @entity156 in 2008			0
in a separate study in @entity162 , three - quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with @entity17 suffered fewer headaches			1
some patients reported tingling in the head and light - headedness , but these typically lasted no longer than 30 minutes ; there were no serious side - effects			0
' about two - thirds of patients find the device helpful in reducing the intensity and / or the duration of their migraines , ' says dr @entity113			1
this is a ' breakthrough ' treatment for those who can not tolerate or do not respond to current treatment , says consultant neurologist dr @entity180 , a trustee of @entity181			0
' it opens the door for a new era in treating migraine headaches			0
we welcome @entity32 guidance and very much hope this treatment will be made available to those in need			0
' for @entity1 , there was one overwhelmingly good reason to give it a go			1
' i was keen to try it because it was drug free , ' she says			0
three - quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with @entity17 suffered fewer headaches after attending the headache clinic to learn how to operate it , she was allowed to take the device home to use whenever she felt a headache coming on , and is thrilled with the results			1
' the device is marvellous			1
as soon as i started using it , my headaches became less frequent and less severe			0
i now often go ten days without suffering from a headache , which is such a relief			0
it has transformed my life			0
' i still sometimes have to take a tablet for my headache , but not as often as before			0
' the treatment 's effectiveness depends on how soon it is given , the number of pulses and the patient 's individual pattern of migraine symptoms			0
for most patients , it can take a few weeks to work out the optimal treatment pattern			0
one possible downside is to do with practicality			0
' it is a bit bulky , and its batteries have to be kept charged , ' dr @entity113 says			0
' it does make a loud bang when you trigger it , but it 's easy to use , ' adds @entity1			1
' you do n't have to hold it for very long and it 's done its job			0
i just wish it was n't so heavy because i ca n't carry it when i go out			0
' however , i still take my tablets everywhere with me , so i can take one if i get a headache when i 'm out			0
' under @entity32 guidelines issued in january this year , @entity17 is approved for the treatment or prevention of migraine episodes in patients with acute or chronic migraine , with or without aura			1
however , it is available only through specialist headache centres and is mostly restricted to patients who can not use other forms of acute migraine treatment - for instance , who find drug treatment intolerable or for those who want to take fewer drugs for their migraine - during pregnancy , for example			0
however , patients who have either a pacemaker or epilepsy should not use the device			1
for dr @entity113 , the gadget gives ' a glimpse of the future of migraine treatment '			0
' it has an excellent safety record , and is a great option for patients who ca n't take standard painkillers or migraine treatments because of other medical issues			0
' understanding exactly how the @entity17 device works is opening up new avenues of research into migraine , which may in turn lead to new treatments for this common and disabling disorder			1
