a newborn baby became @entity2 's youngest organ donor after her kidneys and liver were used to save the lives of two patients			1
the kidneys , just three or four centimetres long , were transplanted into an victim of renal failure			1
the liver cells , known medically as ' hepatocytes ' , were given to another seriously ill person			1
kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb and it is now hoped the delicate procedure will set a ' milestone ' in organ donation			1
the baby girl , who has not been identified , was born at @entity20 , west @entity21 ( pictured )			1
she died a few days later , her brain having been starved of oxygen at some point in the pregnancy a significant proportion of newborns who die in neonatal units could be potential organ donors , so they could save the lives of other sick patients			2
the unidentified donor was a girl born at term after an emergency caesarean section at @entity20 , west @entity21			1
she weighed almost 7lbs ( 3.1kg ) but was very sick , and it became clear her brain had been starved of oxygen for a period during the pregnancy			0
@entity38 made no difference , and repeated examinations showed she was unable to make any spontaneous movement , did not respond to any stimuli , and had fixed and dilated pupils			0
the parents and medical staff involved in her care discussed the possibility of organ donation when it became clear she would not survive			1
supported by the organ donation team , the nursing staff , and the hospital 's psychologist , the parents gave their consent for their daughter 's kidneys and liver cells to be used for the benefit of other sick patients			1
dr @entity61 , of the neonatal unit at @entity20 in west @entity21 , said the kidneys measured just three to four centimetres long and two centimetres wide			1
an adult 's are about three times that size			2
the kidneys , just three to four cms long , were transplanted into an victim of renal failure			1
white liver cells , known medically as ' hepatocytes ' , were given to another seriously ill person			1
kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb and it is now hoped the delicate procedure will set a ' milestone ' in organ donation			1
dr @entity61 , of the neonatal unit at @entity20 in west @entity21 , said the kidneys measured just three to four cms long and two cms wide			1
an adult 's are about three times that size			0
he said : ' you can transplant a baby 's kidneys into children or adults			1
i do n't know exactly what size they will grow to but it is enough for them to function			0
' and the liver cells can be transfused into the blood of patients with end stage liver failure to buy them time while they wait for a suitable donor			1
' they are taken from a fresh liver and function as a substitute liver for a few weeks during that vital window			0

' the baby , who was born midway through last year , died from a lack of oxygen to her brain			2
dr @entity61 said there are plenty of causes of oxygen starvation in the womb and he could not go into individual cases for ' confidential reasons ' but it was a tragedy ' beyond our control			0
' ' the lack of oxygen means other organs could also have been damaged so we had to check which ones - if any - were suitable for transplantation and the kidneys and liver cells were			2
he added that the parents of the baby were keen to go through with the procedure			2
' when we explained to the parents of the baby girl it could be possible to save some lives with their help they were only too keen			0
' they came back wanting to speak to me again within a couple of hours			0
' they did n't need any persuading - not that that is something we would ever try to do			0
it 's a decision that has to come from the parents without any pressure			0
' it 's a very sensitive and difficult issue which is why we have a very experienced clinical psychologist to help them through the process			0
' the case was reported in the @entity168 of @entity169			0
dr @entity61 wrote : ' a very careful and realistic plan was prepared in association with the organ donation team and presented to the parents			1
' after a specialist nurse from the @entity180 and transplant team did a full assessment of the infant 's organs , it was agreed the kidneys and liver cells were retrievable and suitable recipients were located in the country			1
the baby 's liver cells ( file picture of the cells above ) , known medically as ' hepatocytes ' , were given to a seriously ill person awaiting a transplant six days after she was born , and with death confirmed , these tissues were obtained with the help of an experienced surgeon from the @entity197			1
the team said : ' it is due to the extreme generosity of the parents and wonderful professional collaboration between the neonatal team and the organ donation team that this process was successful			2
' this case has set a milestone in the care of newborns in the @entity2			2
' cases such as this are rare but i hope other neonatal units will look at what we 've done and consider doing similar things in the future			0
' they pointed out current advice makes it very difficult for donors to be identified			0
new guidelines from the @entity223 are expected shortly , and these should help to standardise an approach to organ donation among newborns			2
the child 's kidneys , just three or four cm long , were transplanted into a victim of renal failure - and were big enough to function in an adult 's body experts hope this will also kick start a new way of thinking about neonatal organ donation			1
the family of the baby were praised by @entity239 , the organisation that organised the retrieval of her kidneys and liver cells			2
professor @entity245 , associate medical director for @entity246 and @entity247 , said : ' we are pleased the first transplant of organs from a newborn was a success and we also praise the brave decision of the family to donate their baby 's organs			2
' agreeing to donate happens at a heartbreaking time and in a family 's life and our thoughts go out to all families that find themselves in this position			0
' the sad reality is for everybody to get the lifesaving transplant they are desperately in need of , more families who are facing the tragic loss of their young child will need to agree to donation			0
' there are currently 194 young people under the age of 18 waiting for a transplant - of whom 15 are babies under two			0
professor @entity245 said : ' we welcome any good to come out of their own personal tragedy			0
' in october , healthcare assistant @entity282 , 22 , hit the headlines when the kidneys of a five week old baby were transplanted into her at @entity286 in @entity287			2
after the seven hour operation she said : ' words can not express the gratitude i feel to the parents of this baby			0
' my life was standing still - now i can live it			0

unidentified donor was born at term at @entity20 , @entity21
the baby 's kidneys were transplanted into an victim of renal failure
cells from her liver were given to another seriously ill person
@entity308 hoped the delicate procedure will set a ' milestone ' in organ donation
