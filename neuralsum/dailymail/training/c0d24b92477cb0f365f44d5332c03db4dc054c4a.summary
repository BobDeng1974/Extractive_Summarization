climbers captured spectacular pictures of ice appearing to glow blue as they descended 5,280ft into a glacier in @entity4			1
@entity7 glacier trekking guide @entity5 snapped the eerie pictures a quarter of a mile into the @entity9 , in @entity10			1
the 36 - year - old was joined by fellow climber @entity12 , 37 , as the pair explored the moulin , which is a circular , vertical well - like shaft within a glacier			1
picture a vertical shaft in the ice , 40 stories deep , with a huge river of water falling into it , which could not be any colder unless it was ice			1
' the sound of the falling water is deafeningly loud and the spray from the falling water spreads out the deeper you go , and it gets continually darker			2
' add to this the fact that your life is entirely and wholly dependent on your technical competence , with absolutely zero margin for error - if you screw up and fall , you will die			0
' combine all of these factors and you have an incredibly intimidating , yet astonishing , indescribably beautiful environment that is unlike anything else on earth			0
@entity12 appears to be in another world as he walks among the crystal caves created by the glacier deep underground the pair described the climb as like dangling a rope into an enormous vertical blue cathedral that is constantly gushing with water the two climbers spent a total of eight hours inside the huge crevasse before making the long climb back out ' the best way i can describe it is hanging on a string in an enormous vertical blue cathedral , while being drenched by ice water , with the soundtrack of a freight train constantly assaulting your ability to think straight , it 's intense			1
' from around 350 to 400 feet deep , it still took @entity5 and @entity12 three hours to ascend out of the moulin , after spending eight hours in total inside			2
using several climbing ropes , lots of ice climbing screws and standard ice climbing equipment , they were able to make their way through the glacier in temperatures of four degrees @entity86			0
the glowing images disguise the danger the two men were in as they took on the climb , which could have seen them fall to their deaths the climbers return each year to take on the glaciers and explore the daily changes that happen in the huge ice caverns @entity5 says : ' the only consistency on the glacier is that it 's always changing			2
' so , with each shot , i 'm recording a moment in time that will never exist again and all of the features that i have photographed no longer exist			0
' every time i think i 've seen it all , that the glacier can no longer surprise me , i prove myself wrong			0
' there 's always something new to find and discover which keeps me coming back year after year			0

@entity7 glacier trekking guide made the dangerous descend with fellow climber @entity12
the shaft is incredibly dangerous , with a very *narrow* shaft and a river of water falling into it
the pair spent eight hours in the ' blue cathedral ' before making the *arduous* climb back out
