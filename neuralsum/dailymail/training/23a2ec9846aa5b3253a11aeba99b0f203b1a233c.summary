most of us are guilty of doing our fair share of dodgy dancing at weddings and other boozy social events			0
from the ' chicken wings ' of the @entity8 to the hand - flipping routine of the @entity10 - it seems you ca n't escape the awkward moves that take over the dancefloor towards the end of an evening			2
but now ' the point , ' the hand fan , ' the ' fist pump ' and the ' slide down ' are all moves that are set to appear on a dancefloor near you as a new song oh if i catch you - which has become a chart sensation in @entity24 and southern @entity25 - catches on here too			1
it has been first for @entity61 sales in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and other @entity24 countries			0
the song is already popular with djs and nightclubs in @entity47 , with music giant @entity73 hoping for a high chart position here when it is officially released on october 14			2
@entity78 classic : moves such as the @entity80 are already dance favourites in many parts of the world loving it : some of the girls try out the ' fist pump ' while listening to the song fun times : a group of girls show their appreciation of the song by waving their hands in @entity31 , the song is second only to " @entity100 " , by the @entity96 singer @entity95 , but it is blasted on radios and is on the way to being the music of the summer			1
football stars including @entity103 's @entity102 are known to be fans of the song - which is guaranteed to split opinion among music lovers in @entity47			1
the video for the song shows bikini clad women enthusiastically going through the song 's distinctive moves as the singer performs on stage			0
fan : @entity103 star @entity102 is reported to be one of the many celebrity fans of the song			0

' oh if i catch you , ' by the @entity31 singer - songwriter @entity55 has become a dance sensation across the world
set to enjoy the same success in @entity47 as @entity71 snap up the track
