in a short statement released by her parents @entity9 and @entity1 today they said : ' the house from hell will no longer stand			1

family friend @entity112 , said the demolition of the house would help ' heal a huge wound ' felt by the whole town			2
scaffolding went up around the property on saturday and workmen are removing asbestos found in the roof prior to the building being demolished - a process likely to take about two weeks			2
cruel : april 's disappearance sparked the biggest search operation in @entity95 history , but @entity19 's attempts to hide his crime , carried out at home , meant her body has never been found safety first : builders have fenced off the white - washed cottage before it is razed to the ground killer : @entity14 , pictured , murdered april after snatching her and was convicted last year			1
he is one of only around 50 criminals in @entity95 jails given whole life terms mr @entity112 said : ' it 's a huge relief for @entity9 , @entity1 and the rest of april @entity1 ' family , and also for the people of @entity144 who have to walk past that house - perhaps every day of the week - and do nothing but remember the horrible memories			1

april @entity1 's murderer was a serial offender with convictions relating to guns , thefts and road rage attacks , but bizarrely he tried to claim his violent past , dating back 28 years			2
@entity19 wanted his criminal record laid bare during his murder trial so the jury would get to know that he had never been in the dock for sexual offences or for having indecent images of children			0
taken in : @entity19 minutes after his arrest as he was taken in for questioning - the murder then began to spout a series of bizarre lies about what had happened to april this was despite the father of six having an obsession with child pornography , uncovered after police raided his home following april @entity1 ’s disappearance in october 2012			2
having first tried to hide his guilt by helping search for april , police pieced together that he was the prime suspect after his car @entity198 was seen near where she was taken			0
he then told police that he accidentally ran her over and meant to take her to hospital before ‘ blacking out ’ because of a combination of drink and panic			0
a forensic inspection of his car quickly proved this was a pack of lies			0
the police raided @entity19 's home and found he had tried to cover his tracks by trying to clean his house from top to bottom			2
he had washed his clothes , carpets and upholstery while local people were out searching for april , before placing air fresheners in the rooms and cranking up the heating to dry the rooms quicker			2

april ’s blood was found in his living room , hallway , the bathroom door , washing machine door and the shower curtain , the court heard			0
once police confronted @entity19 about the child skull bones in his fireplace he said that they were from a chicken supper he cooked for his children			0
blood under the carpet at his home was because he placed april in front of the fire to keep her warm , he said , as part of his lies about hitting her with a car			0
his then told detectives the child pornography on his computer was because he wanted to track the physical development of his own children .			0
