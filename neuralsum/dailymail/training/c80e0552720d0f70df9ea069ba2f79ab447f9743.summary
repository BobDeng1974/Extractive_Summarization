mr @entity9 said £ 70million of this will be new money from the @entity49 and around £ 80million will be from unspent @entity16 maintenance budgets			1
some £ 70million has come from the @entity49 with £ 80million from unspent maintenance funds within the @entity16			2
but a @entity16 source said : ' there is no spare money in either the basic needs or maintenance budget to pay for @entity9 's kitchens			1
' it was suggested the money would be taken from funds used to provide extra school places			0
but furious @entity3 hit back , insisting the policy had been agreed by @entity63 and @entity64 , and mr @entity4 's ministry should fall into line			1
senior @entity3 source ' the @entity16 are talking b * * * * * * * , ' a senior @entity3 source said			1
' @entity4 and the @entity16 had their eye on the underspend for free schools ... which i think explains the slight bitterness from the @entity16 in some of the briefing			1
' what we are seeing from @entity16 is them going rogue			0
they are completely out of step			0
' it is time for them to stop whining and get behind a policy that they are going to have to deliver			0
the @entity16 are lying if they say there is no money			0
' the deputy prime minister wants the @entity16 now to row back and get with the rest of the government in backing a popular , innovative and exciting policy			1
' @entity91 then made clear that it was @entity5 mr @entity4 's department that were out of line			2
' the position is absolutely the one the @entity99 's office have set out , ' the prime minister 's official spokesman said			2
mr @entity9 joined children for lunch at @entity102 in @entity103 to promote the scheme the policy has also been criticised by some senior @entity3 for offering free lunches to even the wealthiest parents of young schoolchildren , while denying up to poor families whose children are older			1

yesterday he revealed it is new money from the @entity49 into the budget of the @entity16			0
chancellor @entity64 will use tomorrow ’s @entity117 to reveal how the money has been raised			0
deputy prime minister @entity9 mr @entity9 said : ‘ early on i made it very clear that universal free school meals would be my personal priority in this @entity117 and i ’m proud that we are now delivering it			1
‘ from the start of the next school year , every single infant school pupil will be able to sit to down to a free school lunch			0
’ he said the extra £ 1billion over two years will ‘ ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day ’ and also make sure ‘ that schools are not left out of pocket ’			0
he went on : ‘ every child deserves the best possible start in life , and at the same time we are doing all we can to help ease the pressure on household budgets			0
‘ this not only encourages positive eating habits and helps improve concentration and performance in the classroom , but this will also mean significant savings for families			0
‘ providing universal free school meals will help give every child the future they deserve , building a stronger economy and a fairer society			2
’ mr @entity9 has previously boasted of securing the £ 600million to fund the policy in a deal which will see the @entity5 offer a £ 150 tax break to some married couples			1
where the idea of free school meals was piloted , pupils who had the hot lunch were found to be on average two months ahead of children who did not			0
the @entity3 leader insists the policy will increase attainment and make pupils healthier the poorest children saw the biggest improvements in their academic achievements , with a 23 per cent increase in the number of children eating vegetables at lunch and an 18 per cent drop in those eating crisps			2
being given a free lunch also saw between three and five per cent more children reaching target levels in maths and @entity29 – more than the 3.6 per cent rise seen after the introduction of a compulsory literacy hour in 1998			0
the current free school meals scheme for underprivileged children in @entity29 costs £ 428million every year			2
a school food review by @entity188 and @entity189 , founders of the @entity186 restaurant chain , recommended that @entity190 offer free meals to all primary school children			2
extending it to all pupils up to the age of 11 would cost £ 1billion ; the entire education budget is £ 57.2billion			0
sir @entity197 , former @entity3 defence minister , has repeatedly criticised the scheme for not being targeted at those most in need			2
‘ some 1.2 million children living within the government ’s own definition of childhood poverty do not get a free school meal , ’ he said recently			0
