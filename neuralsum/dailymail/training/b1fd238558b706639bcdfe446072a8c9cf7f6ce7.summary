the @entity1 bombed a @entity3 terror group that was in the final stages of a plot to blow up @entity1 airliners with toothpaste tube bombs last night , the @entity0 has claimed			1
alongside its strikes on the @entity12 heartland , officials said @entity1 warplanes hit a previously unknown group of @entity16 militants known as the @entity17			1
the group of seasoned terrorists planned to ' imminently ' attack a @entity1 airliner or other target using a bomb without any metal parts , toothpaste tubes and clothes dipped in explosives , an unnamed @entity1 official told @entity28			0
president @entity30 ordered the strikes after intelligence reports discovered the plot this week , officials claimed			0
briefing : lieutenant general @entity35 ( pictured ) said he @entity1 launched air strikes in @entity3 amid fears that @entity38 - a mysterious group of @entity16 - linked militants - were preparing to mount terror attacks militant : @entity38 's leader @entity42 , 33 , ( pictured ) is thought to have been close to @entity16 's late leader @entity43 since around the time of september 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the @entity1 lieutenant general @entity35 , the @entity0 's director of operations , said tomahawk cruise missiles fired from @entity1 warships in the region were used to hit the group 's compounds , workshops and training grounds around the city of @entity54			1
' intelligence reports indicated that the @entity56 was in the final stages of plans to execute attacks against @entity61 targets and potentially the @entity1 homeland , ' he said			1
@entity38 - which has been described as a collective of ' seasoned @entity16 veterans ' - is understood to intercept @entity61 travelling to fight for radical groups in @entity3 , including @entity12			1
as many of these would - be jihadists retain their passports and travelled to @entity3 without their home nation 's knowledge , @entity38 trains them not for combat in the @entity73 - but rather for future terror attacks back home in the @entity76			1
the group is linked to the much better - known @entity78 only through their shared links with @entity80 led @entity16 - which acts as an umbrella organization for @entity83 terror cells			1
@entity38 is one of several @entity16 affiliates in @entity3 and possibly one of the most secretive groups operating under the cover of @entity3 's civil war			2
but unlike the @entity78 , @entity38 appears to have little interest in the outcome of the uprising against @entity3 president @entity92			2
nor does it seem to harbour ambitions to control vast swaths of territory in the hope of establishing an independent state as @entity12 does			0
instead @entity38 exploits the chaos of the @entity100 to recruit from the many thousands of young @entity61 muslims travelling to the region without prior connections to a specific militant group			0

the group 's leader @entity42 , 33 , is thought to have been close to @entity43 since around the time of september 11 , 2001 terror attacks in the @entity1			2
another senior figure within @entity38 is believed to be @entity145 bomb maker @entity143 , who is also a senior member of another group known as @entity147			0
the overnight missile strikes in @entity3 were followed by attacks by @entity1 warplanes and drones backed by @entity1 's @entity120 allies			1
although @entity38 suffered eight targetted @entity1 attacks the main focus of the action was against @entity12			1
following the raids - the first carried out by the @entity1 against is on @entity3 territory - @entity1 president @entity30 has vowed ' to do what 's necessary ' to deal with the group			2
he said the backing of five @entity120 states - @entity125 , @entity128 , @entity126 , @entity129 and the @entity127 - underlined the support he was building for international action to defeat @entity12 - also referred to as @entity12 ( @entity12 and @entity165 )			2
