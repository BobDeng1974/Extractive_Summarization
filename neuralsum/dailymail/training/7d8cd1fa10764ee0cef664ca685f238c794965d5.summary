by @entity0 and @entity1 this never - before - seen view of the moon orbiting the @entity4 is exactly how alien visitors would see our planet for the first time from their starship windows			1
the images were taken 600,000 miles away by the @entity12 satellite as it passed @entity4 in october , on its way towards @entity15			1
the smaller grey moon is shown passing behind the larger white dot of our planet , to the right			0
when the @entity22 probe flew past @entity4 after performing a series of deep space manoeuvres it received a boost in speed of more than 8,800 mph setting it on course to reach @entity15 by 4 july , 2016			1
the larger white dot pictured here is @entity4 , while the faint grey dot is the moon the @entity12 spacecraft was launched from @entity38 in @entity39 on 5 august , 2011			1
it first performed a series of deep space manoeuvres before returning to @entity4 for a flyby			0
when the spacecraft flew past @entity4 on 9 october this year it received a boost in speed of more than 8,800 mph			1
this set it on course to reach @entity15 by 4 july , 2016			1
after @entity12 arrives and enters into orbit around @entity15 , the spacecraft will circle the planet 33 times , from pole to pole and use its collection of science instruments to probe beneath the gas giant 's obscuring cloud cover			1
scientists will learn about @entity15 's origins , internal structure , atmosphere and magnetosphere			2
professor @entity65 , who was involved in the project , told @entity67 the footage was taken over a four - day period			0
he added the camera was programmed to take an image every 2.5 minutes during every 5 rotations of the spacecraft			0
one of @entity12 's sensors , a special kind of camera designed to track faint stars , was able to give a unique view of the @entity78			2
the result was low - resolution glimpse of what @entity4 would look like to a visitor from afar			0
‘ if @entity88 of the @entity89 said , " take us home , @entity87 , " this is what the crew would see , ’ said @entity83 , juno principal investigator at the @entity84 , @entity85			0
‘ in the movie , you ride aboard @entity12 as it approaches @entity4 and then soars off into the blackness of space			2
‘ no previous view of our world has ever captured the heavenly waltz of @entity4 and moon , ’ he added			1
the cameras that took the images for the film are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft 's three solar - array arms			0
the images used to make the video were taken by the @entity12 satellite , pictured , as it passed @entity4 in october , on its way towards @entity15			1
one of @entity12 's sensors , a special kind of camera designed to track faint stars , gave a unique view of the @entity78 for the first time ever they are part of @entity12 's @entity121 ( @entity122 ) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors			2
these cameras look away from the sunlit side of the solar array , so as the spacecraft approached the system 's four cameras pointed toward @entity4			2
@entity4 and the moon came into view when @entity12 was about 600,000 miles away - about three times the distance between the @entity4 and the moon			1
timing the shots was vital as @entity12 was traveling almost twice as fast as a typical satellite and the spacecraft itself was spinning at two revolutions per minute			0
to assemble a movie that would n't make viewers dizzy , the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing @entity4 at exactly the right instant			0
the frames were sent to @entity4 , where they were processed into video format			0
the cameras that took the images for the film are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft 's three solar - array arms , pictured			0
they are part of @entity12 's @entity121 ( @entity122 ) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors			0
the probe is due to reach @entity15 in 2016 the @entity161 instrument on @entity22 's @entity12 spacecraft recorded amateur radio signals , pictured , from radio operators from around the world during the flyby in october the star tracker ’s designer , @entity65 of the @entity169 , near @entity170 , said : ‘ everything we humans are and everything we do is represented in that view			1
’ @entity12 's @entity161 instrument , which measures radio and plasma waves in @entity15 's magnetosphere , recorded amateur radio signals during the flyby			2
@entity181 , @entity12 project manager at @entity22 's @entity182 in @entity183 , @entity184 , said : ‘ with the @entity4 flyby completed , @entity12 is now on course for arrival at @entity15 on 4 july , 2016			1
’ the @entity12 spacecraft was launched from @entity38 in @entity39 on august 5 , 2011			0
after @entity12 arrives and enters into orbit around @entity15 in 2016 , the spacecraft will circle the planet 33 times , from pole to pole and use its collection of science instruments to probe beneath the gas giant 's obscuring cloud cover			1
scientists will learn about @entity15 's origins , internal structure , atmosphere and magnetosphere .			0

the images were taken by the @entity12 satellite as it passed @entity4 in october
@entity22 's @entity12 probe is on a *mission* to @entity15 , set to arrive in july 2016
when the probe flew past @entity4 it received a speed boost of 8,800 mph
@entity22 said no ' previous view of our world has ever captured the heavenly waltz of @entity4 and moon '
