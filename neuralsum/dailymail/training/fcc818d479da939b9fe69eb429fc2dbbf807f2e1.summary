the @entity2 's most - watched @entity1 video of 2014 was n't the @entity4 address , @entity6 's angry denunciation of the @entity8 terror army or his ground - shattering declaration of new rights for illegal immigrants			1
those moments pulled in about one - tenth as many viewers as a 3 - minute clip showing the president just walking around and meeting tourists in @entity17 that casual ordinary - guy stunt was viewed more than 5 million times since he took the unannounced stroll on may 21 with @entity2 counselor @entity22 in tow			1
' ca n't be regular			0
ca n't be routine , ' @entity6 is heard telling him , jacket flung over his shoulder on a warm spring day			1
' it 's good to be out			0
one told the @entity56 that she though he was a presidential impersonator			0
@entity6 took a handful of unexpected outings in the span of a few weeks , including a @entity63 run and a lunch ad the @entity66 burger joint			2
the president 's campaign aides playfully tweaked him in 2008 by muttering ' the bear is loose ' whenever he would go off script or take an unscheduled detour to press the flesh			1
a @entity74 hashtag , fed by @entity76 staffers , pushed the message when he downed beers and shot pool with @entity54 governor @entity53 and shook hands with a fan wearing a horse - head mask			0
but by mid- 2014 @entity2 insiders tried to leverage the phrase to describe an @entity6 trying to bend another bear – @entity88 president @entity87 – to his will			1
in july as the @entity88 - @entity92 border threatened to disintegrate in a full - fledged @entity87 annexation , the media jabs came fast and furious			0
@entity87 was the bear , pundits declared			0
and @entity6 was the cub			2
the @entity99 president 's fundraising tour continued while his @entity88 counterpart 's armies menaced to the west and solidified their control over the @entity104			2
@entity2 staffers told @entity106 at the time that @entity6 was ' restless ' and ' tired of his bubble			1
' six years into his presidency , it seemed , he had some walking around to do			0
that included a may 16 stop at a @entity116 restaurant and that jaunt to shake @entity66 , where he sat on the lunch counter to take a photo with workers			0
@entity99 seem to relish those moments , reminded of the charismatic @entity124 senator who campaigned in 2008 on @entity125 – long before his approval rating nose - dived amid @entity128 website woes and more serious scandals			0
on may 21 he handed out @entity2 - branded @entity131 's to a seven - year - old girl and her four - year - old brother , who told the leader of the free world that he was actually ' four and three - quarters			1
' @entity136 : with vice president @entity137 ( right ) looking on , @entity6 tried a maneuver in may that would get most @entity66 customers booted from the restaurant @entity141 , wilbur ! @entity6 cracked jokes on july 8 with a man wearing a horse - head mask as he detoured from his schedule to shake hands in @entity147 @entity63 , anyone ? on june 9 the president created his own news cycle by walking across @entity150 in the middle of the day for a caffeine fix that populist moment captured @entity99 ' imagination far more readily than a ' putting an end to sexual assault ' video featuring @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
that @entity163 came in second with just over 1.5 million views , slightly ahead of first lady @entity168 's @entity167 chat about a mass - kidnapping by the @entity171 terror group @entity170			2
the 2014 @entity4 address and presidential speeches on @entity176 ' net neutrality , ' immigration and @entity8 made the top ten for last year			1
but added together , they could n't compete with the audience for a president , with @entity181 a few strides away , just out for a walk .			0

*bizarre* 3 - minute clip of the president strolling through @entity17 and meeting tourists was the @entity2 's most - watched video of 2014
*dramatic* speeches about immigration *reform* and the @entity8 terror army pulled in just one - tenth as many viewers
' putting an end to sexual assault ' video featuring @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 came in a *distant* second
' @entity200 is loose ! ' became a *slogan* in the spring and summer as @entity6 detoured from his schedule and tried to *recapture* his campaign magic
