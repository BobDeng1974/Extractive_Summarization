@entity0 insists there is nothing to stop @entity3 challenging for the @entity5 title this season			1
the 25 - year - old scored his first goals of the campaign on sunday as his brace helped the @entity3 record a 3 - 1 win over 10 - man @entity12 and move up to third in the table for more than 24 hours , before @entity15 leapfrogged them			1
@entity17 's side remain in the top four after 15 games , having won eight of their opening fixtures , as @entity0 struck twice and @entity21 scored late to see off the @entity22 , who had taken the lead through @entity25			1
@entity3 are flying as @entity0 ( left ) celebrates scoring their second goal against @entity12 @entity3 striker @entity0 celebrates scoring his first league goal in 878 minutes of football @entity17 has steered @entity3 to fourth in the @entity5 after 15 games despite earning plenty of plaudits for their attacking approach , many expect @entity3 to drop off the pace during the hectic winter schedule but @entity0 believes they should now be considered contenders			1
' i think there is no limit , we can go all the way to the top , ' the @entity37 international replied when asked how high the @entity3 can finish			1
' we have a great squad and i ca n't say we are going to give up now we are in the top three , we have got a great team and we can go all the way			0
' i think with the team we have got and the manager , the way he is playing and coaching everyone , it is fantastic and i do n't think we will be giving up at all			0
' much was made leading into the clash with @entity12 over the fact @entity17 had plumped to sign @entity0 rather than @entity25 in the summer of 2013			1
former @entity56 man @entity55 has brought @entity57 to the @entity3 midfield @entity21 came off the bench to fire @entity3 into a 3 - 1 lead at @entity61 on sunday the @entity3 boss said his decision would prove right over time , despite the fact @entity0 had scored only twice in the league ahead of the fixture			1
@entity0 has missed plenty of football through injury but has not felt the pressure to come back hitting the ground running with the likes of @entity73 and @entity21 performing well in attack in his absence			1
' i 've not seen anything about it			0
but he chose the right one did n't he ? ' @entity0 replied when asked about @entity17 's comments			2
' i have been out for a long time and the last couple of games i 've been playing i have n't been fully fit			0
' there have been a lot of injuries and i was put in unexpectedly really and played a couple of 90 minutes before i was fully fit			0
now i 'm feel good and strong and i can put myself about a bit more			0
@entity17 embraces @entity0 following the striker 's second goal of the game against @entity12 ' it is always easier ( to come back into the side ) when you have got a big squad			1
you are not relying on one player ; we have a big squad and all quality players that can come in			0
' that is why the players who are not playing are disappointed and the players who are in are putting the performances in to not be left out			0
' @entity12 could have leapfrogged @entity3 with a win at @entity61 but , having taken the lead , they slipped to defeat and have still only won once on the road this season			1
their task was made more difficult when goalkeeper @entity111 was sent off with the @entity22 2 - 1 down and , as manager @entity113 suggested in his post-match press conference , the club have appealed against the decision			1
@entity0 soars at the back post to head @entity118 's delivery across @entity111 and into the net @entity120 came on the for the closing stages and was beaten by substitute @entity21 in the closing stages but , if @entity111 's appeal falls on deaf ears , he is ready to step in heading into @entity125			1
' @entity3 has always been a tough place to come to ; they try to push us high and we could not really find a way through , ' he said			2
' today , we were 1 - 0 up , we had that advantage and we could not get anything out of it			2
that is quite disappointing , but it is just one game of many			0
' when i saw @entity111 coming off his line i knew it was going to be very close for him to reach the ball			0
i 'm always looking forward to playing for @entity12 , and this will be no different			2
' we have some important fixtures coming up			0
we need to get as many points as possible to sit comfortably in the table before the @entity143			2
it is a very important phase for us and we want to get as much points as possible			0
' @entity0 adds a a genuine aerial threat , which can trigger panic among modern central defenders			2

@entity3 beat @entity12 3 - 1 at @entity61 on sunday
@entity0 's brace and a goal from @entity21 sealed *victory*
the @entity3 sit a lofty fourth in @entity5 table after win
@entity0 believes there is ' no limit ' to how high the @entity3 can finish
