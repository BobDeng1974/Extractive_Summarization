dr @entity0 has launched a scathing attack on @entity2 , the organisation he helped co-found in the 1970s , saying it has become ' evil ' @entity2 has been branded an ' evil organisation ' which has ' lost concern for humans ' in an astonishing attack by its own co-founder			1
ecologist dr @entity0 , who quit @entity2 in 1986 , has launched a scathing criticism of the activist group , which he insisted has lost its humanitarian roots			1
his attack on the organisation he helped create comes as former environment secretary @entity15 campaigns against the ' self - serving ' and ' highly - paid ' network of environmental pressure groups he calls the ' green blob '			0
dr @entity0 told @entity21 's @entity20 : ' my problem with @entity2 is they have lost any humanitarian roots they had			1
' when we started @entity2 it was to stop nuclear war and the destruction of human civilisation , that of course is the " peace " in @entity2			0
' the " green " is the environment and that 's good as well , but they lost the concerns for humans ... they have turned , basically , into an evil organisation			0
' he gave the example of so - called ' golden rice ' , a crop enriched with vitamin a which supporters say would help millions of the world 's poorest people improve their diet			2
dr @entity0 said the fact that @entity2 opposed the idea showed that they no longer care about people			1
dr @entity0 helped found @entity2 in 1971 while phd student in ecology , but he later left the group , claiming it had become more interested in politics than science			1
he is now a proponent of nuclear energy and is sceptical about sole human responsibility for climate change			0
dr @entity60 , chief scientist at @entity2 , later shrugged of the criticisms made of his organisation			2
he said : ' when we do campaigns , we look at influence , we look at impact and we are very , very mindful to incorporate social and economic issues into what we do , because otherwise campaigns wo n't work			1
a representative of @entity2 has said the organisation always considers the social effects of its campaigns ' there 's not going to be some kind of green dictatorship which imposes these decisions on anybody			2
' the row comes after @entity80 , @entity2 ’s @entity81 , was exposed earlier this year as having commuted the 250 miles between @entity82 and @entity83 by plane since 2012			0
each trip is believed to have cost @entity2 £ 200 and would have generated 142kg of carbon dioxide emissions , it was said			0
dr @entity60 said mr @entity80 's behaviour was ' a mistake ' and ' should never have happened '			0
on the organisation 's position of golden rice , he said : ' the thing about golden rice is it 's a least - favourable option and it does n't actually exist yet , it 's been many years in proposal and ... it does n't work ' the real solution to this is a proper , balanced diet like the home gardening initiatives in @entity102 have achieved			0
' dr @entity0 ( pictured in 1977 while still part of the organisation ) has now hit out at the activist group			1

co-founder @entity0 says organisation does n't care about people
he cites example of a @entity112 - rice which would help millions if *widely* produced
dr @entity0 says fact that @entity2 oppose crop shows it is ' evil '
comes after the ecologist quit the group because it became ' too political '
@entity2 scientist insists it does care about ' social and economic issues '
