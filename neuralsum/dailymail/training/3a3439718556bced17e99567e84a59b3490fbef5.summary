@entity0 missed the chance to extend their lead at the top of @entity4 , a defeat to @entity6 preventing them from taking a major advantage over @entity8			1
with the champions having suffered a shock defeat away to strugglers @entity12 , @entity0 arrived in the principality knowing a win would take them four points clear at the top of the table			1
but a goalkeeping mistake from the usually dependable @entity19 saw the league leaders slip up , as @entity21 took advantage to score the game 's only goal			1
@entity21 is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring the games only goal for @entity6 @entity19 can not believe his own mistake as @entity6 's goalscorer @entity21 celebrates with @entity29 @entity30 escapes the tackle of @entity6 defender @entity29 , only to see his shot well saved @entity33 , who missed the best chance of the first half when well - placed , makes a tackle on @entity37 @entity6 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity37 ( @entity45 78 mins ) , @entity21 ( @entity46 91 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 82 ) subs not used : stekelenburg , , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54			1
booked : @entity44 43 , @entity42 85 , @entity55 90 @entity0 : @entity19 , @entity56 , @entity33 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 ( @entity61 84 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 72 ) , @entity66 subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 booked : @entity60 45 , @entity58 referee : @entity74 in a game of few clear - cut chances , it was always likely to take a mistake , or a moment of magic to break the deadlock , and in the end the winner came from a combination of the two			1
a lovely move down @entity6 's right hand side , the best of the match , opened up the away defence , with @entity90 and @entity37 combining beautifully			0
but , when @entity48 cut the ball back for @entity21 , he was afforded an inexcusable amount of space 15 yards out by a @entity0 defence that had been bamboozled by a simple stepover			1
even after that , @entity21 's shot should not have slipped through @entity19 's hands as easily as it did , the keeper palming the strike into his own net			2
@entity0 deserved little more , creating few opportunities despite seeing plenty of the ball			2
@entity106 's side had come out of the blocks quickly , dominating possession and territory in the first half without finding a way past @entity38 in the @entity6 goal			0
@entity60 gets up well to connect with a @entity62 cross , but his header drifted just wide @entity30 holds off a tackle from @entity6 midfielder @entity90 during a goalless first half @entity106 makes a tactical adjustment but his side were unable to find a response to going behind @entity62 , a constant threat down the right hand side , set the tone when his ninth minute cross was headed into the side netting by @entity66			0
soon after the winger produced another sumptuous delivery to the far post , only for @entity60 to see his powerful header drift past the far post having leapt highest			0
the hosts did n't create too many chances , but they did come closest to breaking the deadlock in the first 45 minutes			0
martial , leading the line in the absence of @entity135 , took advantage of some sloppy defending to smash the ball past @entity19 , only to see his strike rattle the crossbar			2
@entity66 , who headed wide early on for @entity0 , is tackled by @entity6 captain @entity40 @entity48 came closest to breaking the deadlock early on when he rattled the crossbar from range @entity19 was also forced into action by @entity47 , whose long - range drive needed a fingertip save to keep the scores level			1
however , having survived those scares , @entity0 should have taken the lead just before the break			2
after @entity38 had made a smart save to deny @entity30 , the visitors were gifted a glorious chance from the resultant corner			0
non-existent marking allowed @entity33 a free header from just five yards , but the defender contrived to head the ball high and away from the goal , with the goal gaping			0
and the league leaders were punished for their wastefulness after the break , when @entity21 took advantage of some ropey defending and a goalkeeping error to score the crucial goal .			0

@entity21 opens the scoring after *67* mins after @entity19 mistake
@entity0 stay top of @entity4 , but miss the chance to go four points clear
@entity8 had lost 1 - 0 to @entity12 earlier in the *day*
