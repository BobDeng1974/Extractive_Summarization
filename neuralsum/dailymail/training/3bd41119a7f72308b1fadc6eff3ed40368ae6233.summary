by @entity0 @entity1 has a phobia of cats which she says is ruining her life a mother claims a rare phobia of kittens is ruining her life			1
@entity1 , 27 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , says the sight of a kitten leaves her sobbing with terror and that even a picture of one can trigger a panic attack			1
she says her phobia - known as ailurophobia - has ruined relationships and is now threatening friendships , but she is determined to beat it			1
ms @entity1 , a fulltime mother to @entity19 , 13 and @entity20 , two , said : ‘ i know most people love little kittens but to me they are just evil			1
there is nothing cute about them at all			0
‘ i hate the way they are allowed to just roam around the streets staring at people and hiding			0
‘ i do n’t see them as harmless and cute			0
they are just little monsters			0
i absolutely hate everything about them			0
’ she says her phobia is debilitating because the animals are almost impossible to avoid , meaning she is confined to the house is she sees one and refuses to visit anyone who has a kitten as a pet			1
she claims her phobia has already ended one long - term relationship because her former partner had a cat - meaning she was unable to visit			1
she said : ‘ it was going really well between us but once i found out about the cat , i kept making excuses not to go and see him			2
‘ i was too embarrassed to admit the real reason so would invent reasons to cancel			0
‘ i would have invited him to my house but i was n't ready for him to meet my child , so in the end there was nowhere we could relax together			2
‘ he could n’t understand what was wrong with me and when i finally admitted the truth to him the damage was already done			0
we ’d had too many arguments and decided to split			0
‘ he was sympathetic but people who like cats just can not understand why i find them so scary			2
’ ms @entity1 thinks her phobia may have been triggered by an event she witnessed as a child aged eight			1
ms @entity1 ( pictured with her daughter , @entity69 , and son , @entity20 ) thinks she developed the phobia after seeing her father being attacked by a cat when she was a child she remembers her father taking her to visit her grandmother who owned a cat			1
she said : ‘ @entity76 was playing with the cat like he usually he did and suddenly it just turned and scratched him across the face			2
@entity80 is a fear of cats which causes undue anxiety			1
it occurs even though sufferers know their fear is irrational			2
some sufferers fear a bite or a scratch from a cat			1
others are scared of the ' evil mystique ' of the creatures			2
symptoms can include breathlessness , sweating , shaking , heart palpitations and a fear of dying			2
the phobia is often triggered by an unpleasant experience involving cats , but some people develop it with no obvious trigger			1
treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnotherapy			1
‘ there was blood dripping down his cheek and dad looked shocked			0
i was so scared i burst into tears			2
i never looked at them the same again after that			0
’ initially she avoided cats without too much issue , but as she grew older her fear worsened			1
she said : ‘ i noticed it got much worse after i had my eldest daughter			0
' i would n’t let her touch cats because i was worried about her getting scratched like my father had			1
‘ then as my fear of her getting hurt grew i just started avoiding them all together			1
’ ms @entity1 would scour the streets from her flat window before daring to leave home to make sure it was free of cats			1
if she spotted one she would stay inside until up to an hour after it had gone to make sure the coast was clear			0
if she ventured out and saw one she would turn and run the other way			0
now she claims even the sound of a cat screeching at night sets her palms sweating			2
she said : ‘ my children have grown up with this so they understand mummy hates cats			2
' i do n’t want them to be scared of them so i try to play it down if i see one but there ’s no way i could handle seeing them touch one			2
ms @entity1 says that when she goes out her daughter , @entity19 ( pictured with her little brother , @entity20 ) , has to act as a lookout to make sure there are n't any cats nearby ‘ my eldest is so lovely , she knows what a state i get into so she acts as a look out look , warning me if there is a cat ahead so we can go a different way			1
‘ when we go to the park they ’ll have a quick check around for me before we sit down but if one comes along we have to go			0
’ now she refuses to date cat owners but says her phobia has also threatened friendships			1
recently one of her closest friends needed support after an illness so ms @entity1 agreed to stay for the night if the cat was locked away			1
but she ended up fleeing in the middle of the night when it wandered into the room she was in			0
she said : ‘ i wanted to be there for my friend			0
but i just could n't handle being in the same house as the cat			1
she needed me and i could n’t be there for her because of this phobia			2
i have n’t been able to go back since and i hate knowing i am letting her down when she needs me			0
ms @entity1 says she is terrified of her children ( pictured ) being hurt by a cat ms @entity1 says that before she leaves her flat she has to look out of a window to make sure there are no cats nearby			1
if she spots one , she will not leave her home for at least an hour to make sure it has gone ‘ there are other friends i ’ve grown apart from because they have cats			1
it ’s such a shame			0
my heart sinks when i meet someone new and they tell me they have a cat			0
‘ i think " why ca n’t you have a dog " ? they are so much nicer			0
i ca n’t understand how anyone would want to share their home with something that skulks around and could scratch them at any time			0
’ but she has so far been unable to seek treatment because she ’s terrified it will involve her having to face her fear by holding a cat or kitten			1
she said : ‘ i just can not cope with the thought of having to try and touch one so i have avoided it			0
‘ i ’ve tried to discuss it with my gp but i just feel such a fool and i ’m worried i wo n’t be taken seriously			0
people i have told have usually laughed but it ’s not funny to me			0
‘ i want to beat it because it affects my everyday life so much but the truth is i ’m too scared			0
‘ i hope talking about it now helps others understand how terrifying a phobia can be - even one of cute little kittens			1
