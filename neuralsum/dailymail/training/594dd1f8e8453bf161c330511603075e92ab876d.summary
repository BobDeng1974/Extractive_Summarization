by @entity0 and @entity1 a @entity3 memorabilia dealer who tried to sell a concentration camp victim ’s clothes on @entity6 for more than £ 11,000 has apologised – and pledged to return the garment to the man ’s family			1
dealer @entity10 , 62 , claimed the striped uniform belonged to @entity12 , who died in @entity13 in 1941			1
last night @entity14 said : ‘ i am ready to present the uniform to the family as a donation			1
and i would like to apologise to them for awaking sad feelings and bad memories			1
’ the complete @entity13 prisoner uniform , including cap , shirt , trousers and shoes , which seller @entity10 claimed belonged to @entity12			1
but mr @entity12 's outraged family claim it is a fake several @entity30 armbands , used to identify and demean @entity31 , were on @entity6 for up to £ 165 however , experts and mr @entity12 ’s relatives believe the uniform is counterfeit and have asked police to investigate			1
how the @entity37 broke the story last week last week an investigation by this newspaper revealed how online auction site @entity6 was profiting from the sickening trade in @entity44 relics			2
it caused global outrage and led to an apology from @entity6 , which removed 30 items from sale – including the uniform – and pledged to make a £ 25,000 donation to charity			2
mr @entity12 ’s disgusted relatives accused @entity14 , who lives in @entity54 , @entity55 , of ‘ trying to make money out of a personal tragedy ’			1
mr @entity12 ’s daughter ’s half - sister , @entity58 , 66 , said she would be asking @entity55 police to investigate @entity14			1
ms @entity58 , who lives in @entity61 , @entity62 , said : ‘ this is terrible and upsetting			1
‘ we are absolutely sure this uniform is a fake , which means someone stole his identity			1
’ another of the uniforms since removed by @entity6 , with close - ups of the buttons and material for buyers @entity74 last night confirmed that they are ready to open a fraud investigation			1
@entity14 told @entity37 he bought the uniform from a collector in @entity79 , who had obtained it from an @entity82 dealer			1
@entity14 added : ‘ i never thought that i would cause any harm			1
it is not illegal to buy and sell these items			2
’ dr @entity86 , of the @entity87 for @entity44 studies in @entity89 , said genuine clothing from @entity3 concentration camps was rare : ‘ when the camps were liberated there was a fear of typhus and everything was burnt as a precaution			0
so it is very unlikely that anything beyond a few rags would have remained			0
’ detailed records of victims , including serial numbers , are kept by @entity44 museums and are easily accessible online – making identity fraud simple			2
mr @entity12 , of @entity107 , @entity108 , arrived at @entity13 on january 16 , 1941			1
a few months later his family received a letter saying he had died			2
toothbrushes apparently used by @entity13 victims were on sale at £ 145 a battered case inscribed with the name @entity116 and a @entity30 , listed at £ 492 rabbi @entity117 , of the @entity87 in @entity118 , said : ‘ it is flat out disgusting for @entity6 , to profit from the prison garbs of @entity44 victims			2
they are on the same page as advertisements for major companies like @entity126 and @entity127			0
this is taking the sale of @entity3 death camp memorabilia to the mainstream			0
‘ these precious items only belong in museums because they are witnesses to history			0
this trade is demeaning to everyone who died in the @entity44			0
’ @entity6 has broken no @entity140 laws by selling materials from the @entity44			0
but the same trade is banned in @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
in 2000 @entity146 was sued in @entity145 for allowing an auction of @entity3 memorabilia			0
mrs @entity149 , whose father was shot just a week before @entity13 was liberated by @entity152 soldiers in 1945 , said : ‘ many survivors of @entity13 burnt their uniforms			0
but i do know of some who kept theirs , and other mementoes			0
‘ holocaust ’ sales : @entity160 n’t @entity159 ? the company said it uses a filter system which is supposed to pick up restricted items uploaded by sellers , but admitted that goods can slip through the net			0
@entity6 said that in light of @entity37 ’s findings , it would be redoubling its efforts to remove items of concern			0
how much does ebay make from them ? the site makes ten per cent from the final sale price of items and receives a listing fee ranging from free to a few pounds depending on type of sale and country which it is being sold from			0
in the case of the concentration camp uniform priced at $ 18,000 , the company would receive a listing fee of 50 cents ( 31p ) and royalties of $ 1,800 ( £ 1,125 ) should the item sell for its full price			2
where do they come from ? the authenticity or origin of @entity44 items can not be immediately verified , but the sellers claim the memorabilia is genuine and in some cases have stated that it was originally sourced from the victims ’ families			0
is it illegal ? the sale of @entity44 memorabilia is legal in the @entity140 but outlawed in @entity143 , @entity145 and @entity144			0
profiting from pain : woman 's curlers from the @entity204 were listed at £ 17 @entity206 clogs were up for sale as part of a female concentration camp victim 's uniform the striped pyjama - style concentration camp uniform was worn by death camp inmates			1

@entity10 , 62 : ' i would like to apologise for awaking bad memories '
but victim @entity12 's outraged family say it is a fake
police in @entity54 , where @entity14 lives , are *poised* to open a fraud case
