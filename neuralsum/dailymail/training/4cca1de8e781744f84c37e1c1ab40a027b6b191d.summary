an apple a day could stop you having a heart attack – and may even be as effective as taking a statin			1
healthy over- 50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a tablet , @entity5 researchers claim			1
their study goes some way to proving the proverb coined by the @entity13 : ‘ an apple a day keeps the doctor away			1
’ @entity5 researchers claim healthy over- 50s who add a daily apple to their diet can benefit as much as those who start taking a statin the scientists ’ calculations suggest that prescribing an apple a day to everyone aged 50 and over would prevent or delay around 8,500 heart attacks and strokes a year in the @entity25			1
the health benefits are similar to giving statins to everyone over 50 who is not already taking cholesterol - lowering drugs			0
dr @entity31 , of the @entity32 at @entity5 , said : ‘ the @entity13 had it about right when they came up with : “ an apple a day keeps the doctor away			1
” it just shows how effective small changes in diet can be , and that both drugs and healthier living can make a real difference in preventing heart disease and stroke			0
’ researchers said people should not replace prescribed statins with apples but could benefit by eating more fruit he added : ‘ while no one currently prescribed statins should replace them with apples , we could all benefit from simply eating more fruit			2
’ in the study , published in the @entity59 edition of the @entity60 , researchers used mathematical models to assess the impact of prescribing a daily apple for all older adults			1
they assumed almost three - quarters would eat their apple a day and that overall calorie intake stayed constant			2
they estimate 5.2million people are now eligible for statins in the @entity25 , and if it became policy to prescribe statins to all over- 50s as some doctors want , a further 17.6million would be offered them			1
but this would also lead to a spate of side effects , including 1,000 extra cases of muscle disease , and more than 10,000 extra diagnoses of diabetes			0
the researchers calculate that offering a daily statin to 17.6million more adults would reduce annual vascular deaths by 9,400			2
however , offering a daily apple to 70 per cent of @entity25 aged over 50 – 22million people – would avert 8,500 vascular deaths			1
the scientists calculated that anyone eating one portion of fruit and vegetables , such as an apple , a day benefits from a 12 per cent reduction in their risk of heart attack and stroke			2
and this protection from one portion is roughly equivalent – in a person at low or moderate risk of heart problems – to the reduction in vascular death from taking a statin			0
the calculations suggest anyone already eating an apple a day would gain an additional 12 per cent protection from a second apple			0
the more portions of fruit and vegetables you eat , the greater protection against deaths from these causes			0
latest official figures show only one in three achieve the target of five portions of fruit and vegetables a day			0
dr @entity124 of @entity125 said : ‘ while it is vital those who have been prescribed the cholesterol - lowering drugs statins continue to take this highly effective medication , everyone can lower their risk of stroke with simple lifestyle changes , such as a balanced diet			0

@entity5 researchers say healthy over- 50s who added apple to diet benefitted as much as those who start taking a tablet
study supports @entity146 proverb : ' an apple a day keeps the doctor away '
