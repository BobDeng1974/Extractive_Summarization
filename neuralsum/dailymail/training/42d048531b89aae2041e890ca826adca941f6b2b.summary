@entity2 technology giant @entity0 unveiled their first robot nearly 30 years ago			1
while innovative for its time , the model , dubbed @entity5 , was little more than a pair of metal legs and could take five seconds to complete a single step			0
since then the robot has come a long way - undergoing a series of developments and redesigns that have made it slicker , faster and more robust			2
and this week @entity0 showcased its latest offering : a talking , smiling robot friend named @entity18 that can play football , climb the stairs - and even pour you a drink			1
since then , @entity0 have released a series of redesigns - culminating in the latest @entity18 , pictured right @entity0 's humanoid robot , ascends a staircase as it makes its @entity33 debut at the @entity34 in @entity35 new look : in 1991 , @entity0 added some colour to their robot when they unveiled the ' @entity39 ' ( left )			1
two years later , arms were added to create the @entity41 ( centre )			0
while the @entity41 , debuted in 1997 , looks a lot more like the @entity18 @entity18 – which stands for @entity18 – is eventually intended to help people in various situations of need , such as the elderly , or those in disaster zones			1
the latest version of the robot made its @entity33 debut at the @entity34 conference in @entity35 on thursday , during a demonstration that showed off his skills with both balls and drinks			1
he is ' a little bit of a show - off ' , according to @entity60 , of @entity61 , who helped @entity18 showcase his remarkable range of talents			1
@entity18 has 34 motors to help him perform different types of human movement – such as tilting , balancing and navigating – including a sensor in his wrist which tells him to release a grip			2
using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head , @entity18 can detect the movement of multiple objects , assessing distance and direction			2
standing at 4.3 feet ( 1.3 metres ) the gentle - handed robot can also hold a soft paper cup to pour liquid without squashing it			2
it can also predict the direction a person will walk and instantly take an alternate path to avoid a collision			0
' he absolutely loves the audience response to what he can do			0
' @entity0 began the project in 1986 , when they created the @entity5 robot , which had no torso and took up to 5 seconds to complete a single step			2
in comparison , the new @entity18 can run at up to 9km an hour			0
@entity18 has 34 motors to help him perform different types of human movement – such as tilting , balancing and navigating – including a sensor in his wrist which tells him to release a grip			0
it can even recognise the faces and voices of multiple people speaking simultaneously			0
using the visual information captured by the two cameras in its head , @entity18 can detect the movement of multiple objects , assessing distance and direction			0
its human - like hands can open a bottle , pour a drink and carry goods while also expressing sign language			1
standing at 4.3 feet ( 1.3 metres ) the gentle - handed robot can also hold a soft paper cup to pour liquid without squashing it			2
during the demonstration , @entity18 climbed stairs , ran in a circle and switched from running , walking and hopping without stopping - something his predecessor could not do			2
on the head son ! @entity18 can even kick a football using his updated physique it can also predict the direction a person will walk and instantly take an alternate path to avoid a collision			0
@entity139 - faced @entity18 speaks @entity140 and @entity2 and can carry a tray , push a cart and even play football			1
it is also equipped with technology that enables it to maintain its balance even if its gently pushed or pulled			0
34 motors allow @entity18 to move , and dance , like a human the robot is powered by a 51.8v lithium ion ( @entity151 ) battery and can operate for approximately 40 minutes on a single charge			1
parts of the technology developed by @entity0 for the @entity18 project have been used to help clean - up efforts at the stricken @entity2 nuclear plant @entity159 , but in the humanoid robot , upgrades have focused on making @entity18 better understand the world around himself			1
without giving any time targets for when he might actually be available for domestic use , @entity163 admitted ' we still have a long way to go before introducing @entity18 into the home – we do not put a fixed time line on it '			0
engineers are working on improving his physical capabilities , his dexterity and his ability to lift weight so that he can be helpful in the home			0
@entity163 said : ' there is still a lot of work that needs to be done around people 's acceptance of robots and identifying what their role in society will be			0
' for us as a @entity2 company , and looking at @entity2 where it has an ageing population , we see @entity18 as perhaps helping to look after your elderly parents who live with you , helping your children with their homework and also helping with the daily chores			1
' she did not rule out that @entity18 might one day be available from an electronic shop alongside other domestic appliances			0
he is ' a little bit of a show - off ' , according to @entity60 , of @entity61 , who helped @entity18 showcase his skills			2
earlier the year , @entity200 , chief engineer , @entity200 , said : ' for the first time in @entity61 , @entity0 is demonstrating the all - new @entity18 - the latest generation of @entity0 's remarkable research into humanoid robotics			1
' previous generations of @entity18 have demonstrated incredible fluidity and speed of movements			0
' the all - new @entity18 takes this mobility , task performing ability and interaction with people to the next level and moves @entity0 one step closer to its ultimate goal of developing a robot that can be a helper to people in need			1
' @entity0 said that @entity18 is still in development and there are no existing plans to commercialise the robot .			1
