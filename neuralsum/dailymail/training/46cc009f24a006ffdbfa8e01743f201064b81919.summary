just a fifth of @entity1 believe that humans evolved naturally over millions of years , while the vast majority believe that @entity4 had a hand in the evolution of humans , according to new research			1
according to a @entity11 poll , 21 per cent of @entity1 citizens believe that ' human beings evolved from less advanced life forms over millions of years , and @entity4 did not directly guide this process '			2
meanwhile , 79 per cent of those polled said they either believe @entity4 played a part in our existence ( the largest sector at 62 per cent ) or were not sure ( 17 per cent )			1
believers : the number of people who believe in pure evolution is on the rise in the @entity1 but those who think @entity4 played a part still account for the vast majority - 62 per cent a quarter of the 1,000 people polled said they believed mankind evolved from more primitive life forms but that ' @entity4 guided the process '			1
and a further 37 per cent said they believe that ' @entity4 created human beings in their present form within the last ten thousand years '			0
the findings in fact show a trend towards a greater proportion of @entity1 believing in the theory of evolution , as opposed to the theory of creationism			2
eight years ago , the same poll found that only 13 per cent of @entity1 believed they evolved without the guidance of @entity4 ; that figure rose to 15 per cent in 2008			0
according to the research and consulting organisation , the upward trend is also likely to continue , since young people tend to lean more towards the theory of evolution than older generations			1
on the rise : the @entity11 poll shows that since 2004 the trend towards believing in pure evolution has been steadily rising , in part because young people tend more to lean towards this belief in the latest survey , 31 per cent of 18 - 29 - year - olds said they believed @entity4 played no part in their evolution			1
in schools , however , the nation remains divided on how to teach children of mankind 's evolution			1
the @entity11 researchers asked a second question concerning creationism ( the religious belief that the universe was created by a supernatural force ) and intelligent design , a form of creationism that argues against natural selection , attributing evolution instead to an intelligent cause			0
the poll found that 40 per cent favour teaching creationism and intelligent design , while 32 per cent opposed such teachings , and 29 per cent were not sure			0
not surprisingly , the vast majority ( 83 per cent ) of those describing themselves as atheist were opposed to the idea , while those who cited a religion were far more likely to support it , particularly @entity95 ( 76 per cent ) , @entity96 ( 52 per cent ) and @entity97 ( 42 per cent )			0
evolution or creationism ? : a declining number of @entity1 polled believe human beings in their present form are created by @entity4 , but what about @entity105 stars @entity106 and @entity107 , pictured attending the @entity109 premiere last month in @entity110 ? in the political arena , the survey found that 57 per cent of @entity113 favoured teaching creationism and intelligent design in public schools , versus just 30 per cent among @entity116			1
meanwhile , just five per cent of @entity113 supported the theory of a natural , @entity119 , evolution			0
the findings show a remarkable shift in beliefs in the @entity1 since a renowned @entity124 court case 88 years ago , which charged school teacher @entity125 with teaching evolution , which was at the time against the law in the state			0
divided nation : in schools , 40 per cent of those polled favoured the teaching of creationism - greater than the number who believed @entity4 created all human beings in their present form @entity125 lost the trial , according to @entity11 , but the case raised the profile and support for the argument to teach evolution in schools			2
