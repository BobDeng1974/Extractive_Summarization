but after various phone calls , she was eventually told @entity11 had been taken to a tip in @entity30 - and when she rang there , she was told her pet had been cremated in line with their policy			1
mrs @entity5 said @entity11 - whom she had owned since he was a kitten - was micro-chipped and should have been scanned after the body was picked up , so she could be contacted			2
she added : ‘ it is a disgrace to all pet owners who pay to have their pets micro-chipped for the council just to throw them away like a piece of rubbish at the tip. ‘ it has been such a distressing experience throughout			0
i still ca n't believe that they just took him to the tip. it 's bad enough to lose a pet without having to go through all this as well			0
