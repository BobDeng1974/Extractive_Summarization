by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 for @entity3 @entity4 and its allies must extend the campaign against the @entity7 into @entity8 , say @entity4 military officials			1
the @entity4 has so far restricted its military action to @entity11 , but there are concerns the action against the terror group will not be effective while it still has safe havens across the border			1
@entity4 army general @entity18 , chairman of the @entity19 , said at the @entity20 last night that the current strategy can only contain @entity7 , not defeat it			1
' can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in @entity8 ? the answer is no. that will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a non-existent border			2
' in the @entity48 senior @entity45 mp sir @entity44 , a former secretary of state for defence , went even further , saying the @entity49 must be prepared to work with @entity8 's pariah president , @entity50 , to fight @entity7			1
' sometimes you have to develop relationships with people who are extremely nasty in order to get rid of people who are even nastier , ' sir @entity44 told the @entity57			1
enemy 's enemy ... senior mp sir @entity44 , left , a former @entity48 defence secretary , said the @entity49 must be prepared to work with @entity8 's pariah president @entity50 , right , to fight the @entity7 threat found their footing : @entity65 @entity64 soldiers stand guard at @entity67 in northern @entity11 yesterday after it was recaptured from @entity7 militants with the help of heavy air strike support from the @entity4 military the @entity7 insurgency in northern @entity11 and @entity8 is , it seems , leading to a significant redrawing of political allegiances across the @entity76 â€“ at least temporarily			1
calls for political engagement with the @entity80 regime of @entity8 president @entity50 as well as the theocrats of @entity82 have made them unlikely potential bedfellows of the @entity4 and its @entity85 allies			1
just 12 months ago , @entity49 lawmakers were seriously debating launching air strikes against @entity89 positions in an effort to halt its resistance to rebels who sought to overthrow the dictatorship			2
now those very rebels ' @entity8 strongholds are all but in the sights of the @entity98 's drones and bombers , while a senior @entity48 parliamentarian has identified @entity50 as the enemy 's enemy who is now our friend			1
@entity82 too was facing the threat of military action to halt the nuclear programme which @entity106 , in particular , feared was working towards an atomic weapons programme			0
but with the @entity4 saying it may deploy limited ' boots on the ground ' to defend @entity4 interests in @entity112 there is the bizarre prospect of @entity114 standing shoulder to shoulder with @entity82 @entity116 already stationed in @entity11			2
meanwhile , @entity106 's recent air and ground offensive in the @entity119 , ostensibly against @entity121 militants but effectively hitting thousands of @entity123 civilians , has seen the jewish state 's international standing plummet			0
and there are questions about how far @entity7 's power and influence is down to the help of wealthy individuals in @entity132 , the oil - rich @entity4 ally			1
the kingdom is well - known for espousing a fanatic form of @entity136 known as @entity137 , whose adherents , like the @entity7 's militants , are violently opposed to the beliefs of @entity142 in @entity11 and elsewhere			2
the comments came after @entity4 air strikes helped @entity11 and @entity65 forces regain their footing in @entity11 , including the recapture of the strategically vital @entity67 dam which had been seized by militants			2
but @entity4 defence secretary @entity26 , who spoke alongside gen. @entity18 at the @entity20 , warned that the well - resourced militants from @entity7 can be expected to regroup and counter-attack			1
' we 're looking at all options , ' said mr @entity26 , who said the group , which has capitalised on the disenfranchisement of millions of @entity11 and @entity8 @entity136 , was the biggest terror threat the world has ever seen			1
' they are an imminent threat to every interest we have , whether it 's in @entity11 or anywhere else , ' said mr @entity26			0
asked if @entity7 posed a threat to the @entity4 comparable to that of the attacks of sept. 11 , 2001 , @entity163 said the group was ' as sophisticated and well - funded as any group we have seen			1
' they are beyond just a terrorist group , ' he said			0
' they marry ideology , a sophistication of ... military prowess			0
they are tremendously well - funded			0
this is beyond anything we 've seen			0
' the stepping up of rhetoric against the @entity7 - which is alternatively known as @entity182 ( the @entity182 ) , or @entity182 ( the @entity182 ) - came after the group apparently released a video showing the gruesome murder of an @entity4 photojournalist , @entity186			1
militants from the group , which is so extreme in its tactics and ideology it has even been disowned by @entity191 , has seized territory across northern @entity11 , but its power base is in regions of @entity8 rendered lawless by the three - year - old civil war against president @entity50 's @entity198 regime - a secular socialist dictatorship			2
in @entity11 , the anger of @entity136 sidelined by the @entity142 - led government of former prime minister @entity203 was said to have helped engender public support for the advances of @entity7 militants			0
gruesome : the video which purports to show the murder by beheading of @entity186 , an @entity4 photojournalist taken hostage by militants from the @entity7 mr @entity26 said : ' @entity182 will only truly be defeated when it 's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised sunni that happen to reside between @entity212 and @entity112			1
' but analysts have said @entity8 opposed to the @entity50 's government have been left with a deep sense of bitterness at the apparent change in approach to the regime , which is accused of a range of human rights abuses in its attempts to defeat rebels and win the civil war			2
yesterday marked a year since a chemical attack that killed hundreds near @entity212			0
despite uncertainty as to who launched it , the @entity49 had blamed @entity50 's military for the killings			2
@entity231 of eastern @entity232 , the @entity212 suburb hit by the attack , told the @entity0 via @entity234 that he is still haunted by what he saw that day			0
' and here we are , a year later , still getting bombed with barrel bombs , warplanes and chlorine , and no one cares , ' he said			0
president @entity50 has long maintained that the uprising against him was a conspiracy carried out by @entity182 extremists and terrorists , not a revolt against a dictatorship			0
fanatics : a fighter from the @entity7 holds up the group 's black banner in the city of @entity253 , @entity8 neither mr @entity26 nor @entity18 gave any indication of an imminent change in the @entity4 military approach in @entity11 , which president @entity257 has said will include further airstrikes but not the introduction of @entity4 ground forces			1
the @entity20 yesterday said @entity4 warplanes had launched six airstrikes overnight to help solidify @entity11 and @entity65 forces ' efforts to retake and maintain control of the @entity67			0
it said the latest strikes destroyed or damaged three humvees , multiple roadside bombs and another insurgent vehicle			0
the attacks brought to 90 the number of @entity4 airstrikes in northern @entity11 since august 8			0
of those , 57 have been in support of @entity11 forces near the @entity67 .			0

@entity7 can not be defeated while it has safe havens in @entity8 , says @entity4
sir @entity44 mp says @entity49 needs to work with @entity50 of @entity8
' @entity7 are beyond anything we have seen , ' says @entity26
