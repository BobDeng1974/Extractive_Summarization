by @entity0 published : 00:53 est , 8 august 2013 updated : 03:04 est , 8 august 2013 @entity1 , chairman of the influential @entity2 , called on @entity3 and education secretary @entity4 to support selective education senior @entity7 mps demanded a return of grammar schools in @entity10 yesterday after the conservatives in @entity12 announced that they will bring them back if they win the next assembly election			1
@entity1 , chairman of the influential backbench @entity15 , called on @entity3 and education secretary @entity4 to support selective education where there are currently no grammar schools			1
and he said existing selective schools should be allowed to expand further			2
there are no remaining grammar schools in @entity12 and only 164 in @entity10			1
@entity3 has angered many of his backbenchers by refusing to overturn a ban introduced by @entity24 on new grammar schools			1
but in a challenge to the leadership , @entity26 threw down the gauntlet by proposing plans for children to undergo academic selection at 14 - rather than the old 11 plus - choosing whether to continue with rigorous academic subjects or concentrate on technical or practical courses			0
mr @entity1 , who resigned from the @entity7 frontbench in 2007 after mr @entity3 said he would not support more @entity36 , said his party should do more for parents in @entity10 who do n’t want to have to pay for selective schools			1
he told the @entity40 : ‘ i ’m delighted to see colleagues in @entity12 thinking so creatively about ways to improve standards of state education			1
' in @entity10 @entity4 has done an enormous amount to increase choice and diversity in state schools			2
‘ i hope we will also be prepared to look at ways of freeing up schools in areas that do n’t currently have grammar schools to introduce academic selection			1
' everybody accepts that selection is necessary at 16 before people go on to sit a-levels			0
there ’s no reason in principle why selection at 14 should n’t be tried			0
popular : the proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 ‘ in @entity10 the government celebrates the success of our existing grammar schools and is happy to allow them to expand or set up annexes in areas which already have grammar schools			1
' there is a massive and unfulfilled demand for the rigour of academic selection in other parts of the country where current laws , introduced by @entity24 , prevent parents having the option of grammar schools in the state sector			1
’ @entity86 , the @entity7 mp for @entity87 , also voiced support for the plans			0
he said : ‘ bring back grammar schools ! hope the @entity7 party in @entity92 [ is ] listening to what we are saying in @entity12			1
’ his colleague @entity95 said he ‘ loves the @entity97 impact ’ of the @entity26 announcement			0
@entity99 , the conservative shadow minister for education in @entity12 , declared : ‘ it is time we put the @entity36 back into education and @entity12 has just that perfect opportunity			2
she said : ‘ we could see the benefit of creating two equitable streams of education , one alongside the other , a dualing that begins at 14 - giving children the chance to develop important core subject skills before embarking on their chosen path			2
’ the law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding			2
but the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils			0
the proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 - and almost double the historic low of 1986			0
over the past 25 years , their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands			0
there are now more than 161,000 pupils in state - funded selective schools			2
the next @entity7 signal on selective education will come when education secretary @entity4 rules this autumn on whether to allow one of two grammar schools in @entity131 to build a new ‘ annexe ’ in the @entity131 town of @entity133 , miles from the original schools			1
a @entity137 spokesman : ‘ we have changed the rules so that popular schools , including grammars , can expand in response to parental demand			0
' we have received two formal applications from grammar schools in @entity131 to expand onto the @entity133 site			1
we are currently assessing these applications			0
’ under devolution , the @entity26 are free to set their own policy independent of mr @entity3 ’s party in @entity92			0
a @entity152 spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t have an opinion on @entity26 education policy because it is a devolved matter			0

@entity1 , chairman of the @entity15 , called for @entity157 to support selective education at 14
there are no remaining grammar schools in @entity12 and only 164 in @entity10
