the mouth - watering prospect of the @entity2 at the @entity3 does put the @entity4 into perspective in a week of @entity7 failure			1
on sunday night we have @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 against @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
meanwhile our own version of a clasico wil be taking place at @entity18 — but no club in the @entity4 has a forward line like those in @entity22			2
increasingly we ’re a stepping stone to better things , having lost @entity9 and @entity12 to @entity22			0
what is obvious , however , is that the failure in the @entity27 was not a failure of @entity30 clubs			2
it was a failure of clubs with owners from @entity34 , the @entity35 and @entity36			0
in those @entity27 games there were five @entity30 players in the three starting xis			1
@entity14 , @entity12 and @entity41 will be in action for @entity43 on sunday night @entity10 , @entity9 and @entity11 will be hoping to fire @entity44 to victory in the @entity2 @entity46 was signed by @entity47 for £ 35million from @entity48 in 2013 @entity47 became the last @entity30 team to be knocked out of the @entity27 last week @entity47 's players leave the @entity3 looking glum after being eliminated by @entity43 @entity52 's @entity51 has enjoyed an impressive season after breaking into the first team and the managers were from @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
the @entity4 may be failing but it ’s not its englishness letting it down			1
so now that even a huge influx of global thinking and talent at both executive and playing level at football clubs has failed , perhaps we can rethink the premise that we need to keep bringing in players and directors from abroad			2
of course , there will always be room for the best imports			0
but you ca n’t tell me @entity46 is a better player and better prospect than @entity51			1
they do a similar job , the only difference being he is a £ 35million transfer and therefore deemed worthy of a place at a top - four club			0
it ’s time to ensure that some of the proposals from the @entity86 commission , which i sat on , come into place , not least the tightening up of work permits on foreign imports so that only the best from outside the @entity92 can play here			0
we ’re failing in @entity7 anyway so the @entity4 need to ensure we ’re not forever looking overseas for solutions .			1

@entity4 clubs not failing in @entity7 because of their englishness
@entity99 , @entity100 and @entity47 had five @entity30 players in their starting @entity102
@entity46 is not better than @entity51 even though he cost £ 35m
