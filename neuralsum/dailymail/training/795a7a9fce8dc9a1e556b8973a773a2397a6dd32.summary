strawberries contain high levels of iodine children deprived of iodine in the womb are worse at literacy especially in spelling , a new study warned			1
but lack of the chemical had no effect on a child 's maths skills , suggesting the deficiency affects the development of auditory pathways and auditory working memory			1
scientists say expectant mums could prevent long - term neurological impairment by taking supplements as part of their daily diet			0
@entity24 is absorbed from food and plays a key role in brain development , but even a mild deficiency during pregnancy can harm the baby 's brain development			1
the nutrient can be found in a variety of foods and is especially rich in shellfish , but pregnant women should not eat this food			0
the study examined standardised test scores of 228 children whose mothers attended the @entity43 's antenatal clinics in @entity44 between 1999 and 2001			1
the children were born during a period of mild iodine deficiency in the population , but conditions were reversed when bread manufacturers began using iodised salt in october 2001 as part of a voluntary iodine fortification programme			2
results showed inadequate iodine exposure was associated with lasting effects with nine - year - olds - the children who received insufficient iodine in the womb - gaining lower scores on their literacy tests particularly in spelling			2
however researchers from the @entity63 found that low iodine intake had absolutely no effect on maths scores			1
they suggest iodine deficiency may take more of a toll on the development of auditory pathways and consequently , auditory working memory			2
children who were fed adequate levels of iodine in the womb performed better in reading tests			0
a deficiency did not affect maths results however			1
they say the results are preventable if pregnant women take daily dietary supplements containing iodine			0
dr @entity83 said : ' our research found children may continue to experience the effects of insufficient iodine for years after birth			0
@entity90 cheddar cheese ice cream eggs beef pork @entity96 apples oranges grapes strawberries ' although the participants ' diet was fortified with iodine during childhood , later supplementation was not enough to reverse the impact of the deficiency during the mother 's pregnancy			1
' fortunately , iodine deficiency during pregnancy and the resulting neurological impact is preventable			2
' pregnant women should follow public health guidelines and take daily dietary supplements containing iodine			0
' public health supplementation programs also can play a key role in monitoring how much iodine the population is receiving and acting to ensure at - risk groups receive enough iodine in the diet			0
' the results are published in the @entity125 .			0

experts have discovered that iodine intake during pregnancy affects a child 's ability to read in later life
but a deficiency in the nutrient did not affect child 's maths results , said @entity44 study
