@entity1 , of @entity23 , vanished after taking an eight - month dive master course on the island of @entity5 , during which time he kept in regular contact with his family			1
he was due to return home for @entity28 , but mrs @entity29 , 46 , said he changed his flight to january 8 after ' running into trouble ' in the @entity2 capital			1
however her son , who lived with his parents and two younger siblings in @entity38 , near @entity39 , did not board the plane and has not made contact since january 6			0
now mr @entity1 's distraught family and police are growing increasingly concerned and are appealing for any information that would indicate where he is , and that he is alive and well			1
new evidence shows money was withdrawn from his account last week and the police are trying to get hold of @entity50 footage to see if the transaction was made by mr @entity1			1
meanwhile his increasingly worried mother is preparing to fly out there herself to look for him			1
' @entity1 went out to @entity2 last april to relax and do a dive masters course and we had regular emails from him and @entity58 updates , ' said mother - of - four mrs @entity29 , who is a teacher			1
' he was meant to come home for @entity28 and he had sent lots of emails chatting about what he would do when he returned and how he was looking forward to seeing the family			0
' but for some reason he did n't arrive			0
' @entity67 family : mrs @entity29 and her second son , @entity1 , 22 , who has gone missing in @entity2 mrs @entity29 and husband @entity69 , 58 , thought he might have been visiting a friend and waited for him to turn up			1
but they became concerned when they suddenly got an email from him on december 23 saying he had run into trouble in @entity14			2
' he told us he had tried to get another flight sorted but could n't , so he had returned to the island of @entity5 , ' she said			1
' we were relieved he had made contact but then all communication went quiet again			0
' we rang the dive school to check if @entity1 was alright and they said he had become very withdrawn and refused to talk to us on the phone			1
' kind , considerate and sensitive ' : @entity1 ' we were extremely worried as it did n't sound like he was in a very good place			2
' on january 3 they had another email from their son saying he had a flight organised for january 8 but once again , he did not turn up			0
' we know he booked the flight but he was n't on it , ' said mrs @entity29 , who has three other children , @entity92 , 24 , who lives in @entity93 , @entity94 , 18 and @entity95 , six			0
' the dive school said he left the island on january 2 with all his diving gear , so it looked as though he was going to catch his flight , but it never happened			2
' mr @entity1 's family has not heard from him since and @entity102 has now launched an appeal urging anyone who knows where he is to contact them			2
the police have been carrying out extensive enquiries to find him and have been liaising with contacts in @entity2 in attempts to trace him			2
mr @entity1 did a @entity112 engineering course at @entity113 and planned to go into the @entity114			2
but he broke his leg and had to postpone his application , so travelled to @entity2 last april to recuperate and do a diving course			1
' he was having a whale of a time and absolutely loving it , ' added mrs @entity29			0
' but he is a home body and i know he was really looking forward to coming home			0
' @entity1 is a kind , considerate , sensitive person , who often puts others ' needs before his own			2
he loves the outdoors , nature and in particular water sports and ocean life			0
' we just do n't know what has happened to him , if he is injured or had a breakdown or got in with the wrong crowd			0
' we do n't mind what has gone on , we just want to know he is ok			0
' ' i know he was really looking forward to coming home ' : mr @entity1 's mother is preparing to fly out to look for him mrs @entity29 added : ' we all really miss him and love him and want him to come home			1
' if @entity1 is reading this appeal now , i would urge him to get in touch with us or with police and let us know that he is ok			2

i will go with my husband , my eldest child or my brother			0
