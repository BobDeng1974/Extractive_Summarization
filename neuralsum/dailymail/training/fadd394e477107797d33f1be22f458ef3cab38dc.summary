his victims said he had told them that ' when a man and woman sleep together they join up their energies so that they never split again			0
a man can suck energy from a woman through that hook , it makes the woman tired			0
' but if a man has more hooks he has more energy and he is in better position to give the woman energy and help			0

' the court heard that @entity39 took the victim to a tiny apartment in @entity109 , told her to undress and to lie naked on the bed			1
she said @entity39 then did some breathing exercises with her to get her ready for the unhooking			1
@entity113 said : ' @entity42 came , encircled me with crystals then entered me with force			1
it was extremely painful and had nothing to do with tantra			0
' it was hurting me , i was terrified			0
but i was so brainwashed that i even then still believed that this was in some way good for me			0
' she said that the ordeal with the frequent sessions went on for six months and it was only at the end of it when she felt worse than ever that she realised she had been conned			0
@entity9 's unusual methods of removing the negative energy finally resulted in a police investigation in 2007 on a number of victims came forward , and in the same year he vanished abroad			2
he was joined by his assistant two years later when police widened the investigation to include her as well			0

according to accusation he raped at least eight women between 2004 and 2007 but the real number was probably far higher			0

typical symptoms were relationship problems , depression and low self - esteem			0
@entity42 's defence lawyer @entity179 urged the court to throw out the charges saying that all of the women had gone into the sex act with the sect leader willingly			1
he said : ' the women knew what would happen so it was not a crime			0
' however judge @entity190 decided that @entity9 and @entity39 chose their clients carefully by targeting vulnerable young women			1
handing out the sentence she said : ' they only chose attractive young women who could also be useful to them financially and as sex objects			2
it is clear that the main idea of their school was not helping people			0
' @entity9 , who also claims to be a photographer , writer , traveller and mountain climber is offering books and photographs on his website , as well as personal consultations			2
a three - day session with @entity42 costs 108,000 @entity212 ( £ 3,085 ) .			2
