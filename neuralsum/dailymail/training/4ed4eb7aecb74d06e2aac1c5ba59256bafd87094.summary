when it came down to choosing one of the best names in football , @entity1 ’s parents had two choices			1
their son was to be named either after his mother or the family ’s pet labrador			0
‘ thankfully , the labrador won , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ my mum ’s name is @entity14 , so i ’m glad i did n’t get that			0
’ there is more to the @entity18 midfielder than just his name but it has certainly helped to get him noticed			1
@entity18 midfielder @entity1 is looking forward to playing against @entity22 in the @entity23 power is being tracked by the likes of @entity22 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 ‘ the worst was thinking that i ’d been named after @entity31 ’s alter ego character in @entity32 , ’ he says , ‘ but when i looked it up i was relieved to see that episode did n’t come out until i was six			1
‘ i got asked to do a piece for the @entity1 car magazine once , although i did keep my clothes on for the pictures , ’ he jokes			1
. and i get a double - take from lads when i introduce myself from time to time but i ’ve got used to it			0
i ’ve even called my baby son @entity42 ’ fortunately , @entity1 has a football talent that is also attracting attention			1
the 21 - year - old is expected to become the latest product of @entity18 ’s academy to step up into the big time with even this weekend ’s @entity23 opponents @entity22 among his admirers			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 have also charted his progress this season ; one that has brought nine goals amid @entity18 ’s struggle to escape the clutches of a second successive relegation , this time from @entity58			1
as a local boy , it has been a difficult fall for @entity1 to endure			1
‘ getting relegated last season was the worst experience of my career , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ we needed to beat @entity65 to have a chance but we had a man sent off and the game fell away from us			2
i was taken off and i remember the @entity65 fans singing ‘ ’ going down , going down ’ ’ as other results filtered through			0
i was crying on the bench			0
‘ i was sick for weeks afterwards , embarrassed to go out			0
it was very hard to take			0
‘ my dad and a lot of my friends are big @entity18 fans and they tried to lift me but the only time you get it out of your system is when you get back playing again			1
’ @entity1 sat down with @entity83 's @entity82 to discuss his side 's upcoming encounter the 21 - year - old rejected the chance to join @entity89 's academy at the tender age of eight the plan was to bounce back quickly but new manager @entity93 was sacked after just two wins in 14 games and , with @entity18 staring the @entity96 in the face , @entity91 was brought in to start the salvage operation			1
‘ i think i ’ve had six managers since i turned professional , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ @entity100 , @entity101 , who gave me my debut , @entity103 , @entity104 as caretaker , @entity93 and now the boss			0
@entity107 of them are different characters			0
@entity91 came with a reputation for being strict and he is but it works for me			0
he ’s helped me a lot and i ’m playing with confidence now			0
every time i go on the pitch i believe i ’m going to score			0
’ power has scored two goals already in this season ’s @entity23 , scoring the winner in the first round against @entity121 and deciding the second round replay against @entity123			1
he is quick to point out his first ever @entity18 goal was also in the @entity23 against @entity125			1
it seems ominous for @entity22			2
‘ i hope so , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ i ’ve always had an affection for the @entity23			2
my earliest memory was watching @entity89 beat @entity18 4 - 2 at @entity129 in 2001 with my mum , who ’s a big @entity89 fan , and i saw " the @entity131 " when @entity132 was out on his feet but inspired @entity89 to beat @entity134 at @entity135			1
it ’s always exciting , it ’s a great competition especially for clubs in our position			0
‘ we ’re under no illusions it will be a tough game			0
there are @entity146 sides that struggle to get the ball off @entity22 so we ’ll do well to get a result but history shows anything is possible			2
’ power has played under six managers since turning professional - including @entity100 ( pictured ) @entity1 watched @entity152 inspire @entity89 to victory in the 2006 fa cup final in @entity135 an eye - catching performance could help propel power to the level he is destined for			1
educated at @entity159 , where former prime minister @entity160 attended , @entity1 is ambitious but remains grounded			2
you would expect little else from a young man who turned down the chance to join @entity89 at the age of eight to stay with @entity18			1
‘ like everyone i ’d like to play at the best level but @entity18 have always looked after me , ’ he says			2
‘ @entity167 gave me the chance to stay with @entity89 when i was young but i enjoyed myself more at @entity18			1
i ’ve never regretted it			0
‘ you see players who stay with big clubs chasing a dream but the reality is it is often better to step back or sideways to sustain a career			0
‘ playing at this level is hard but it ’s a great experience			0
we ’ve just played five games in 13 days			0
i played against @entity179 the other night and it was like swimming in treacle , my legs felt that heavy			0
‘ we had @entity183 from @entity89 on loan here and he could n’t believe how hard it was			2
playing for @entity187 development teams , players have ability but the games are not as competitive			0
you could leave a club like @entity89 after years and have no experience of playing league football			1
at @entity18 i ’ve played nearly 100 games at 21 , that can only stand me in good stead			2
’ for now , the power is with @entity18 .			1

@entity18 ace @entity1 is excited to be playing in the @entity23
power rejected the chance of joining @entity89 at the age of eight
@entity23 opponents @entity22 are said to be *interested* in @entity1
