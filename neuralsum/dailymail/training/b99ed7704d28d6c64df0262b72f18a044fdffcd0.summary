off - colour @entity0 was bowled for a golden duck in @entity3 ' three - wicket win at home to @entity5 in the @entity6			1
@entity0 has been in prolific form for much of the competition , hitting three half - centuries , and has continued to make it clear he still harbours ambitions of an @entity13 return			2
those hopes are not shared by his former employers , however , and the @entity17 - born batsman - controversially sacked by the @entity13 11 months ago - missed his latest chance to demonstrate his renewed form before the @entity20			0
@entity0 was bowled out for a golden duck by @entity22 in the @entity6 in @entity23 @entity22 ( second right ) is mobbed by his team - mates after removing the threat of @entity0 with his first ball @entity0 walks off the pitch but has a chance to avenge the dismissal with @entity3 in the semi-final the global tournament will begin on february 14 , when @entity13 face @entity23 in @entity33 , and @entity35 's squad are already @entity36 for the tri-series against the @entity20 co-hosts and @entity39			1
@entity0 took his place in the @entity42 side for their last match before the @entity6 knockout stages , despite a heavy cold , only to aim a big hit and miss his first ball from @entity22 ( four for 27 ) to put the @entity48 seamer on a hat - trick as the @entity50 tried to defend a total of 179 for two			2
it therefore fell to others - chiefly @entity54 ( 103 not out ) with a brilliant 64 - ball century , and some late hitting too from @entity56 - to complete the run - chase with three balls to spare			0
the @entity3 ' reward for their victory is a home semi-final .			0

@entity0 has been in *formidable* form in the @entity6 in @entity23
but he was dismissed first ball by @entity22 of @entity5
@entity0 's @entity3 won by three wickets to reach the semi-final
