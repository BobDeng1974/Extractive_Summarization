@entity2 's @entity1 winning captain @entity0 has been brought back onto the pitch by the creators of @entity6 15 's @entity5 , with the game providing a fascinating breakdown of the defender 's attributes and how he compares with today 's players			1
@entity0 is widely regarded as the finest player to wear an @entity2 shirt and @entity15 , the makers of @entity5 , show that @entity0 would undoubtedly be worth , and would have earned , millions if he was playing today			1
his defensive capabilities make him a mix of @entity18 , a @entity1 winner with @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 but @entity0 's ball control , passing ability and balance match him with the best midfielders in the game , such as @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
captain @entity0 ( centre ) holding the @entity1 after @entity2 's victory in 1966 at @entity33 @entity0 , pictured in @entity35 colours ( left ) , has been created in @entity6 15 's @entity5 ( right ) @entity0 's attributes in the game rank him alongside some of the best present day players and it is @entity27 , alongside his father @entity41 , a team - mate of @entity0 's at @entity35 who played twice for @entity2 , who led the tributes to the man who is synonymous with @entity45 football			1
' i remember stories from my @entity49 telling me ' this is the type of player you want to be , but also more than that this is the type of man you want to be ' , ' @entity46 said			0
' if you were to put @entity0 in any era , in the era he played or moving up to the era now with ( @entity60 ) @entity60 and ( @entity61 ) @entity61 , with his quality across the board , he would be able to deal with all of them			2
' the game rates @entity0 's reactions on par with @entity69 goalkeeper @entity68 , at 89			1
but @entity41 revealed that the one chink in @entity0 's otherwise gleaming armoury was his pace , but his instinctive reading of the game meant that his speed was seldom exposed			1
' he was n’t the quickest around , but i think a lot of his ability was in his head , ' @entity41 recalled			0
' he used to read everything before anybody else			0
he was there before it happened basically			0
you do n’t coach that , you ’re born with it , but he used it very well			0
' @entity89 ( second left ) was a team - mate of @entity0 's ( centre ) at @entity35 @entity91 played for @entity2 106 times , two appearances less than @entity0 did @entity0 ( right ) poses with @entity95 captain @entity94 ( left ) before @entity2 faced @entity95 in the 1970 @entity1 @entity0 's eye for an interception is rated at 91 , the same as @entity98 's @entity21 , while his strength in the air is 82 , level with @entity20			1
a rating of 89 for marking places him alongside @entity18			0
but it 's @entity0 's ability in possession of the ball that is something which places him outside of his 22 - year career span from 1956 - 78			1
contemporary defenders are expected to be comfortable with the ball at their feet , bringing play out from defence and entwining phases of play from the back into midfield			0
with ratings of 82 for both short passing and ball control equalling @entity28 and @entity46 respectively , as well as 81 for balance matching @entity29 , @entity0 was clearly not just comfortable with playing out from the back , he was very good at it , too			1
@entity0 's rating of 89 for marking is the same as @entity121 and @entity19 defender @entity18 ( right ) @entity0 also has a rating for passing of 82 ( left ) which is the same as @entity28 ( left ) of @entity121 midfielder @entity27 ( left ) has the same ball control rating as @entity2 legend @entity0 at 82 @entity0 's reaction are rated at 89 , the same as @entity69 and @entity127 goalkeeper @entity68 ironically , for a man that is emblematic of football in @entity2 , it is a style that is not immediately associated with @entity45 play			1
' if you give a ball away @entity0 would never moan at you , he 'd just give you a look , a look that said ' we do n't do that here , we have to keep the ball ' , ' @entity41 said			2
' he won the @entity1 and he led by example on the pitch			0
he played so many games for @entity2 at the standard that he played at , he is the greatest captain @entity2 ever had and @entity2 ever will have			2
' @entity0 played 108 times for @entity2 , as well as making 544 appearances for @entity35			2
he passed away in 1993 at the age of 51 to bowel cancer			0
play as @entity0 in @entity149 @entity6 , and experience the ball control of @entity151 , the reactions of @entity68 and the marking of @entity18 in one legendary centre back			2
@entity0 is available from 6pm today , exclusively on @entity155			0
