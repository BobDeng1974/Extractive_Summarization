@entity2 ’s @entity1 revolution has even extended to the children ’s creche at @entity5			1
the play area where @entity1 ’s stars used to leave their kids on match days while they socialised with their wives and girlfriends in the players ’ lounge next door has been converted into a medical room on the instruction of @entity1 ’s new manager			1
previously , the creche was situated between the medical room and the lounge , but it has been knocked through to double the size of the treatment room			1
@entity2 listens to what his assistant @entity23 has to say on the @entity5 touchline the creche was located next to the players ' lounge at @entity5 the old players ’ lounge , which was also next to the home dressing - room at @entity5 , has been split in two – one half is now a pre-match warm - up area and the other is an interview room for overseas media rights holders - while a new combined players ’ lounge and children ’s area has been relocated elsewhere in the stadium			1

’ it is the latest change implemented by @entity48 since he took over in the summer after the @entity68 ordered a £ 3million overhaul of @entity1 ’s @entity61 training base			2
two training pitches have been ripped up and replaced with the identical @entity73 surface that is used at @entity5 , a £ 500,000 video surveillance system has been installed so @entity48 can analyse his squad more closely in training , and sleeping pods are available for players to rest in between double training sessions rather than having to go home			2
