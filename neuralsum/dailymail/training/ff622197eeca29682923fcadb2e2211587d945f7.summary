@entity1 ’s chaotic immigration system has seen a dramatic rise in the asylum backlog as officials struggle to get a grip on controls at our borders			1
the pile of ' pending ' applications waiting to be dealt with has soared by almost a quarter in a year , with the most dramatic rises since home secretary @entity12 shut the discredited @entity13			1
there are fears that attempts to clear the logjam will lead to terrorists and dangerous offenders being allowed to stay in the @entity1 after appeal to reduce the burden of more paperwork			0
the number of pending cases awaiting an initial decision hit 22,207 , up 23 per cent in a year and the highest level since the coalition was formed in may 2010 the government faces fierce criticism for both failing to remove people who pose a threat to @entity1 and not resolving the cases of those who qualify for refuge from oppressive and dangerous regimes overseas			1
latest figures show that in october there were 22,207 pending asylum cases , up 23 per cent in a year and the highest level since the coalition was formed in may 2010			1
in the months after @entity39 took power the number of pending asylum applications gradually fell , reaching a low of 14,188 in may 2011			1
but since then the number awaiting an initial decision has soared dramatically by more than 50 per cent			0
the sharpest increase came after home secretary @entity12 moved to shut the @entity13 after repeated criticism for its failure to get a grip on the crisis			1
asylum cases are now the responsibility of @entity53 within the @entity54			1
from september to october the number rose by 7 per cent in a single month - 1,398 cases			2
the @entity54 blamed the rise in cases pending in part on a 14 per cent increase in the number of asylum applications it dealt with in 2013 compared to a year earlier			1
but some immigration lawyers accused the @entity54 of withdrawing growing numbers of cases if they think they will lose appeals , creating further delays			1
in march home secretary @entity12 moved to break up the @entity13 after five years of catastrophic failure @entity70 ’s shadow immigration minister @entity69 said : ‘ these figures reveal the scale of the incompetence and backlogs under this government despite @entity12 ’s promise to get a grip			1
‘ it ’s now urgent that the home secretary actually takes real action to solve this backlog			0
‘ it ’s unacceptable that people are remaining indefinitely in the country because the home secretary ’s department ca n’t make decisions and each month is simply adding cases to the backlog when people apply for asylum			2
’ as more cases arrive each month , the numbers which have not been dealt with for six months has also risen sharply			0
from a low of 2,848 six - month old cases in october 2011 , the number of long - delayed applications has rocketed by 175 per cent to 7,846			2
one immigration lawyer told @entity99 that @entity100 dealing with asylum cases are now judged on their success rates , so if they think they will lose a case it will often be withdrawn			2
' when these withdrawn decisions are sent back to case owners , it is not unusual for them to get caught up in the backlog of delayed decisions , ' the lawyer said			0
' there are often further significant delays before we receive a ' final ' decision			0
' this , in association with the increasing delay in initial asylum decisions , has caused further misery for many of those who fear persecution in their countries of origin			0
' the number of cases not dealt with within six months has also risen sharply to almost 8,000 having fallen below 3,000 in 2011 last year the home affairs select committee warned that some people have been waiting for up to 16 years for a decision on their asylum application			1
it also raised fears about rushed decisions to grant asylum to people ‘ who later emerge to be involved with terrorist activity ’			2
mr @entity69 added : ‘ we need a robust but fair immigration system where decisions are made quickly and people who are rejected are made to leave the country , whilst ensuring that those who genuinely need asylum can get it			0
‘ after nearly four years in @entity146 , @entity12 ’s immigration policies are in shambles			0
we need action now to sort out this mess			0
’ @entity70 's shadow immigration minister @entity69 said home secretary @entity12 had to get a grip in march mrs may killed off the @entity13 after five years of catastrophic failure			1
the agency behind a string of disastrous immigration scandals was cut in two and brought into the @entity54 under ministers ’ control			0
mrs may admitted the agency , set up under @entity70 , had been ‘ troubled ’ and condemned its ‘ closed , secretive and defensive culture ’			0
she also said fixing the system and clearing the huge backlog of cases would take ‘ many years ’			0
a @entity54 spokesman said : ' the @entity1 has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need it			2
we are committed to completing applications as quickly as possible , but asylum cases are often complex and require full and thorough consideration			2
' asylum applications in the year to september 2013 were up 14 per cent on 2012 and this increase in applications has impacted on casework time			1
' despite this , in 2012 - 13 , 78 per cent of initial decisions were taken within six months , and 54 per cent within 30 days			0

surge in the number of cases which have not even been considered
sharpest rise in the backlog since @entity12 shut the @entity13
@entity54 blames a 14 *%* increase in asylum applications in a year
but lawyers claim cases are being shelved if the @entity54 fears losing
