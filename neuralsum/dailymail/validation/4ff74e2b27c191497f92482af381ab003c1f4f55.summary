as political grillings go , it was not exactly @entity2			2
@entity3 leader @entity3 today faced a grilling from @entity6 star @entity5 , who seemed a little confused about the @entity3 ’ name , and what the election was all about			1
mr @entity3 had to patiently explain that the party was not called ‘ demo - cats ’ , after @entity11 wondered why it had such a ‘ weird ’ name			1
’ in tribute to the star 's blunder , the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat			1
but amongst the journalists and broadcasters in the audience was the 24 - year - old reality tv star , who is said to be making a documentary for @entity46 on the election			1
@entity11 questioned why every party thinks they are right about everything , what is the point of voting @entity3 and told mr @entity3 that being deputy prime minister must be ‘ sick ’			1
the unlikely duo appeared to hit it off , and later posed for a selfie			1
but the most bizarre exchange came when the unlikely interviewer asked about the party ’s name			2
‘ why are they called @entity3 @entity59 ? it ’s a long word innit ? ’ @entity11 asked			1
mr @entity3 tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988			1
‘ there used to be a @entity65			0
and then used to be a party called the @entity67			2
‘ this was before my time , they got together and created the @entity3			1
’ ‘ oh so you teamed up ? , ’ said @entity5			0
' i wondered that because it ’s a weird word , innit ? it ’s got cats in it			1
’ @entity77 , mr @entity3 tried to put him right			1
‘ it ’s not “ cats ” , it ’s “ crats ”			2
’ the penny finally dropped			0
‘ oh it ’s “ crats ”			0
i thought it was “ cats ”			2
’ mr @entity3 tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988 which saw the creation of the @entity3 the conversation moved on to the merits of power , and just how much mr @entity3 wields			1
‘ you are basically like , you rule this country right ? ’ ‘ i ’ve been deputy prime minister for the last five years , ’ mr @entity3 replied			1
i sort of rule @entity11			1
i was going to say , someone else will be prime minister next ? are you going to be prime minister ? ' the @entity3 leader , currently on around 8 per cent in the polls , had to admit this was unlikely			1
‘ i would love to be prime minister but i ’ve got to be open with you @entity5 , i do n’t think i am going to win this election outright			2
‘ i do think that like last time the debate will be about which mixture of parties in government			0
if you speak to @entity112 and @entity113 they will say they are going to win outright , they wo n’t do			0
‘ everybody knows they are not going to win outright			0
’ @entity11 is due to interview @entity118 ’s @entity112 and @entity119 leader @entity113 during the election campaign			1
mr @entity3 said that he should challenge them both on the idea that either of them can win outright			1
‘ when you speak them , they will tell you both that they will win			0
everyone knows they are not going to win outright			0
‘ the question is who do you want making decisions who have got the right values and instincts and feelings about stuff			0
i think the @entity3 - not “ cats ” - have shown in the last five years have got good instincts			1
’ @entity5 was in the audience for the @entity3 leader 's morning press conference on mental health and @entity146 funding @entity11 is due to interview @entity118 ’s @entity112 and @entity119 leader @entity113 during the election campaign somewhat stating the obvious , @entity11 admitted that he does not ‘ really know much about all the politics ’			1
it was only his second day in his job as a roving reporter on the campaign trail and so far ‘ at the moment to me everyone just seems to want to win ’			1
‘ everybody is fighting for the same position			0
i do n’t really get it , ’ he said , telling mr @entity154 : ‘ you ’ve taught me a lot about @entity3			2
at least i know the name now			0
’ pointing to his all - white outfit , he added : ‘ i was meant to be wearing a suit today but they did n’t tell me i was meeting a leader			2
’ @entity11 later said he thought was a ' nice bloke , to be fair ' , adding : ' he was honest , he told me he were n't going to win - i think honesty is the best policy			2
' if - not saying i 'm going to be prime minister - i was going to lose something and genuinely thought i was going to lose , i would be honest and say i was going to lose			0
i think that was quite a nice thing of him to say			0
he was a nice guy			0
' he added that he was ' excited ' about meeting the @entity118 and @entity119 leaders : ' @entity113 is the prime minister			0
' but to be fair , to me , they are all prime ministers			0
they 're all on tv , they 're all doing good things , they 're all trying to make people happy , so in my eyes they 're all nice people really - like , at the moment anyway , until i maybe meet one of them and he 's not nice			0
' but they 're all sweet at the moment			0
' asked if there were any words politicians should use , @entity11 laughed as he replied : ' they could use reem			2
no , i 'm joking			0
they could use that , but they wo n't			0
