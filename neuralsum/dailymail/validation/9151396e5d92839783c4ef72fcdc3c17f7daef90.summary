five bunker shots , four dropped shots , three missed putts from short range , two poor chips and one blow into the water			2
and that was just the front nine			2
it 's fair to say @entity11 's curious @entity10 funk continued in the opening round of the @entity13 at @entity14 on thursday			1
at least on the back nine there were enough good blows on show to hint it will not be too long before we can enjoy a more customary service			0
the world number one had an eagle and three birdies in a blistering five hole spell to come home in 33 blows and salvage a 73			1
while that might have been barely ok in the context of the field as a whole it was a radical improvement on what appeared a likely score at halfway			0
@entity11 placed the blame on his outward half on being too tentative			1
' after nine holes i thought there was really not much more to lose , so go ahead and be more aggressive , ' he said			0
' it paid off a little and the eagle was really important			0
hopefully i can get off to a better start in the second round and get back into it			2
' @entity11 hits a shot from the fairway during the first round of the @entity13 in @entity10 @entity11 lines up a putt on the 16th green during a difficult opening round for the world no 1 @entity11 tries to play his way out a trouble after landing his shot in the bunker on the 17th hole he 's certainly got some work to do			1
@entity11 will start out no fewer than 11 shots off the pace set by former @entity62 @entity61 player @entity60			1
given there was a decent breeze blowing for most of the day , his 62 was a remarkable effort			0
fellow @entity62 @entity66 shot 66			0
world number three @entity67 carded a 69 while @entity71 @entity70 , runner - up here last year , composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies			1
as for @entity11 , a desperately mediocre outward half of 40 strokes meant he had played his first 45 holes in the @entity10 this year , taking in last week 's two rounds at the @entity78 , in a startling 11 over par. the world number one thought he had ironed out some difficulties he experienced in the wind last week but there was precious sign of it at this stage			1
@entity88 2 @entity87 plays his second shot on the 10th hole ad the @entity62 finished one under par @entity67 kept the heat on the leaders as the @entity94 finished the day 's play three under par opening up from the tenth offered the chance of a flying start , since there are two par fives in the first three holes			1
but @entity11 drove into fairway bunkers on both to squander the chance for early gains			1
just to compound the frustration , his approach to the par four 11th was a metre short of being perfect , and plugged in a greenside bunker to bring about an unlucky bogey			2
every good iron shot he played he could n't take advantage , while every bad shot invariably led to more damage to his scorecard			2
two over par coming to the 18th , @entity11 became another victim of this punishing hole as he found the water from the middle of the fairway with his approach , and failed to get up and down for a bogey from the side of the green			1
@entity71 @entity70 composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies it was n't until his 13th hole that we got the first glimpse of the real @entity11			1
a sumptuous long iron to the difficult par three fourth set up his first birdie of the day and lit the spark on a run that saw him birdie two of the next three holes before registering an eagle three at the 8th			2
even during this spell , however , there were sloppy bogeys at the 5th and the 9th			0
no wonder he headed straight to the range afterwards			0
two players who will not be remembering their rounds with any affection were @entity149 and @entity150			0
@entity149 's 74 was notable only for the fact it was the first time in 190 consecutive rounds on the @entity153 that he had failed to register a single birdie			0
@entity156 's nightmare was even more complete			0
the @entity157 put two balls into the water at the 18th to complete an awful 84			0
it was his worst competitive score in 455 events as a pro. @entity163 , who became the first man to play in 50 @entity13 events , was one over par after nine			1

@entity11 played a *disastrous* front nine in the opening round of the @entity13 at @entity14
even at this early stage , @entity11 had fallen a *distance* behind his playing *partners* , world no 2 @entity87 and no 3 @entity67
@entity71 @entity70 , runner - up at the *tournament* last year , composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies .
@entity163 , playing in his 50th @entity13 event was one over par after nine
