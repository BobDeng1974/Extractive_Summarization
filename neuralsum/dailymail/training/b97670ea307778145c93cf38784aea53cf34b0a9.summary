by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:46 est , 19 november 2012 updated : 06:48 est , 19 november 2012 justice minister @entity2 is claiming £ 1,666.67 per month for a flat in @entity4 , even though she lives within commuting distance of the capital a government minister who lives only 19 miles from the @entity8 is claiming taxpayers money to fund a second home in @entity4			1
justice minister @entity2 today defended the arrangement in which she lives in a £ 1.8million home in @entity14 , @entity15 – outside her @entity17 constituency - but also rents a flat on the bank of the @entity20			1
she is allowed to claim expenses on the flat - near the @entity23 building in @entity24 - because her constituency is considered too far to commute from the capital			2
but @entity14 , where she lives , is not far enough from @entity4 for the constituency @entity30 - @entity29 @entity28 - to make similar expenses claims			1
mrs @entity2 ’s expense claims will be revealed in a documentary tonight , which will also show how more mps than first thought are claiming rent on a second home while letting out a property they own nearby			1
last month it emerged 27 mps were renting out homes they owned while claiming expenses on a different property			0
but @entity45 ’s despatches will say at least 32 mps have entered into the same arrangement , which is allowed under new rules imposed after the expenses scandal which banned claiming for mortgages from the end of august			0
the @entity52 will today publish details of the landlords of 300 mps , against the wishes of commons speaker @entity57			0
at least four mps are thought to be renting homes to each other			0
some have suggested the complex arrangements are the unintended consequences of the system put in place after widespread abuse of the expenses system was uncovered in the last parliament			0
as part of the reforms , only mps who have constituencies outside @entity4 can claim second home expenses			1
but the rules do not state that the mp has to live in their own constituency			2
mrs @entity2 , who was promoted to the @entity76 in the september reshuffle , lives in @entity14 which is considered too close to @entity4 to have a second home in the capital			1
but because she is mp for @entity17 she is claiming £ 1,666.67 per month - the maximum allowed within the rules , which caps rental claims at £ 20,000 per year			1
mrs @entity2 has filed claims for rent since march this year			1
mrs @entity2 's taxpayer - funded flat is on the bank of the @entity20 , near the @entity23 headquarters in @entity24 a spokeswoman for mrs @entity2 said today : ‘ mrs @entity2 's constituency has been deemed by @entity52 to be a @entity90 constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in @entity4 or in the constituency			1
‘ she has a base in her constituency at her mother 's property , where her son also lives , so she sees no need to rent a further property there			2
‘ the focus of her time and responsibility has always been @entity17 and the @entity105			0
’ but campaigners accused mrs @entity2 of breaking the spirit of the rules designed to protect taxpayers ’ money			1
@entity111 , chief executive of the @entity112 , said : ‘ @entity2 's arrangements certainly appear to be against the spirit of the rules			0
the taxpayer - funded allowance for a second home is meant to be there for mps living in a constituency home from which they can not reasonably commute to @entity119 on a daily basis			2
‘ most people would expect that by choosing to remain living in her @entity15 home - which is a commutable distance from @entity4 - mrs @entity2 would have made herself ineligible to make these claims			1
this is a loophole in the rules which ought to be closed			0
however , @entity52 insisted the arrangement was in order			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we set the rules up based on the constituency the mp represents			2
we provide support for one of those locations to help with renting a flat			0
‘ ultimately it comes down to the mp 's judgment about what they need to claim for			0
we do n't check to see what private assets an mp has			0

@entity29 *qualifies* for a second home allowance because she is mp for @entity17 in @entity144
but she lives in @entity14 in @entity15 , which expenses *watchdogs* rule is too close to @entity4 for expense claims
a spokesman for mrs @entity2 insists she is focused on her constituency
