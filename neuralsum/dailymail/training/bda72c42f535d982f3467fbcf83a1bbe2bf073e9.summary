by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has told how he came an ‘ inch away from dying ’ of a heart attack that has convinced him to finally tame his hard - living ways			1
the @entity7 guitarist , 65 , was still drinking a bottle of wine a day and smoking 30 cigarettes , despite a long line of serious health scares			1
but it was not until he suffered his second heart attack three weeks ago that the father of two young twins finally received the wake - up call he needed to give up alcohol and cigarettes			1
‘ that part of my life is over as i do not want to die , i want to live			2
’ speaking for the first time about the ordeal , @entity2 described how he was lying alone in the cabin of his luxury tour bus near the @entity36 city of @entity37 when he felt the first telltale pains in his chest			1
it had been less than eight hours since the multimillionaire had finished a sell - out gig in @entity43 and in that time he had drunk a bottle of wine and smoked ten cigarettes			1
‘ i was an inch away from dying , ’ he said			2
‘ i remember the bus stopping at about 4.30am in the middle of nowhere and i started to feel very ill. ‘ i felt a terrible pain , in my chest and down both arms and across my shoulders			2
i did n’t know if it was a heart attack or not but i suspected it was			1
it felt like an elephant starting to sit on your chest			2
‘ you do n’t know whether you ’re going to die or not			2
you lay there in incredible pain not knowing what to do with yourself			2
there ’s no relief , you just hope you do n’t die , because i was lying there dying i guess			0
’ @entity2 – who had a quadruple heart bypass in 1997 , a throat cancer scare in 2005 and his first heart attack in 2011 – managed to wake up his personal assistant @entity68 , who called an ambulance			1
before his last heart attack , the 65 - year - old was still smoking 20 cigarettes a day and drinking a bottle of wine the musician , who along with @entity76 helped found the hugely successful @entity78 rock band 47 years ago , was taken to a local hospital before being flown back to the @entity78 in a private jet for emergency surgery			1
while on the operating table , he had another heart attack			1
it meant @entity7 , who have had a string of hits including @entity88 ’ @entity89 and opened the live aid concert in 1985 , were forced to cancel a number of gigs across @entity94			0
@entity2 , who lives in @entity95 with his third wife @entity22 , 54 , and six - year - old twins @entity25 and @entity21 , said : ‘ i ’ve had 50 years of smoking and drinking and abusing my body			1
‘ there comes a time when you have to look at yourself and think , “ @entity108 , that ’s it , it ’s now time for a change ”			0
all my life i ’ve defied the doctor ’s orders , thinking that i ’m made of steel			0
@entity2 , pictured with his first wife @entity114 , left and his second wife @entity115 , right , at live aid ‘ but as stupid as this may sound , i ’m pleased i ’ve had this heart attack because i could n’t see a way out of my bad habits			1
’ @entity2 enjoyed a hedonistic lifestyle throughout most of his years as a rock star – at one point spending £ 1,000 a week on cocaine and drinking at least a bottle of vodka a day			1
he stopped taking drugs 11 years ago but continued to smoke and drink heavily , even after having a stent fitted three years ago			1
he was released from hospital four days after falling ill on august 2 and was due to perform a few days later			0
but at the insistence of his doctor , @entity2 pulled out of the gig			1
speaking from a boutique hotel in @entity134 , @entity135 , he said : ‘ it was the first time ever that i ’ve missed a gig and it was a very odd feeling because even though i was n’t there , i lived the gig in my mind			0
’ @entity2 , right , with his third wife @entity22 , said he has not touched a drop of alcohol in three weeks @entity2 has now abstained from alcohol or cigarettes for three weeks – the longest time since the age of 15 – and he says he has never felt better			1
‘ there are so many advantages i never realised to being sober , ’ he added			0
‘ when i wake up in the morning i want to get up and get the day going and i ca n’t tell you how much better i feel			2
‘ my wife has been begging me to sort myself out , telling me “ you ’re going to die if you do n’t stop ”			0
i realise now for the first time in my life that if i carry on i will die			0
i do n’t regret the things i ’ve done but i look back and it ’s incredibly frightening the way i ’ve lived my life			0
‘ in the light of sobriety now , sitting at home in @entity27 with my feet up out on the terrace on lovely warm evenings , thinking , “ @entity159 , you just did n’t realise ”			0
’ ‘ i ’ve always loved the fun side of life and had a good sense of humour and the fact you do n’t drink does n’t separate you from your natural sense of humour			0
’ the musician , who is performing tonight with @entity7 in @entity173 , added : ‘ i ’m going to enjoy my life so much more now			0
i ’m ready to rock , i ca n’t wait			0
