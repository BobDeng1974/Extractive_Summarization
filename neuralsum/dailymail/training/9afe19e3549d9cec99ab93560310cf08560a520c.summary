by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 21 august 2012 updated : 08:17 est , 21 august 2012 air conditioning units fitted at a school gym that athletes were using for training have been removed just days after the end of the @entity6			1
the gym at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity7 was known to be stiflingly hot and one teacher claimed that pupils could only use it for 15 minutes at a time because of the high temperatures			1
there have even been cases in the past of children fainting during @entity20 lessons as a result of the conditions			0
teachers at the school have now hit out at @entity25 as ' hypocrites ' who were going against the idea of the @entity6 legacy			1
the gymnasium at @entity9 in deprived @entity10 , @entity7 , had air con installed so athletes could train there before the @entity6 organisers agreed to install air conditioning units in the school 's gym so that volleyball teams could train in the sports hall a mile away from the @entity39			1
but in contrast to the ' @entity6 legacy ' promised to @entity7 and the rest of the capital , the generators powering the new air conditioning units were removed as soon as the @entity46 finished			1
@entity25 confirmed the air conditioning units would not remain at the all - boys school , prompting critics to label the ' sporting legacy '			1
one teacher at the school branded the situation ' complete hypocrisy ' , while other staff , including the headteacher , were said to be ' very angry '			0
the teacher , who did not wish to be named , said @entity25 removed the air conditioning in the stifling gym even though the school offered to pay to keep it in place			1
training base : @entity25 temporarily upgraded the school 's gym so volleyball players could train there before competing at @entity65 details emerged as @entity67 said @entity68 needed to ' use the inspiration of the @entity46 to get children playing sport more regularly '			1
a pupil at the boy ’s secondary school reportedly collapsed in the sports hall and was rushed to hospital in the last week of term - just days before air conditioning was installed for the arrival of athletes			2
pupils are currently limited to using the hall for 15 minutes at a time , according to teachers , one of whom went as far as saying the the building was ' making children ill '			2
@entity9 , in the @entity7 borough of @entity10 , is just a mile from the @entity88 in @entity89 , and its students come from some of the poorest families in the capital			2
@entity25 , which was in charge of the school site during the @entity46 , said the sports hall did not need permanent air conditioning because term did not fall ' during the hottest summer months			1
' a teacher at the school , who asked not to be named said : ' we have a lot of children getting headaches and experiencing breathing problems after playing sport in there			0
the building is making children ill. ' it is one of the most used buildings in the whole school and is used by after school clubs as well			0
' legacy : @entity9 is around one mile from the @entity116 in @entity7 @entity117 , 53 , a former teacher at @entity118 who is close friends with a number of teaching staff at the school said : ' they are furious			2
they wanted to keep the air conditioning but they ’ve just been walked over			0
' there is a big issue with ventilation in the sports hall - pupils have actually collapsed from overheating			2
they said the @entity6 were going to bring all these benefits to children in an area that really needs them and its just rubbish			0
' they bend over backwards for athletes , but as far as they are concerned children can just suffer			0
' a @entity25 spokeswoman said : ' the air cooling used during the @entity6 is temporary			1
historically it might have been needed during the hottest summer months			0
' those months are not when school normally happens , so the removal will not affect the students ability to enjoy their physical education classes during regular school months			0
' we always made it clear that the facilities we were putting in were for the @entity46 time period only			0
' the air conditioning was hired by @entity25 and therefore there was no option for the school to buy from us			2
' however the school did get upgrade works paid for by the @entity157 , such as the installation of a new floor			0

@entity9 gym had air con installed especially for volleyball stars training
gym *blighted* by overheating problems and had *previously* seen pupils faint *due* to stifling air
but @entity25 remove air con units as soon as @entity46 finish
teachers brand ' @entity6 legacy ' a ' joke ' and ' hypocrisy '
