criticised : @entity0 , the former prime minister , at the @entity2 @entity1 , where he was accused of ' betraying ' terrorism victims @entity0 was heavily criticised yesterday for ‘ betraying ’ terrorism victims after defending his secret deal to send letters granting amnesty to @entity10 fugitives			1
the former prime minister insisted the @entity2 peace process would probably have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects – the so - called ‘ on the runs ’			1
the scheme , set up by the @entity20 government in 1999 , assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters that they were no longer being hunted by the police			1
some 95 recipients of the so - called ‘ comfort letters ’ were linked to almost 300 murders			0
under hostile questioning from the @entity28 affairs committee , mr @entity0 refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients ‘ get out of jail free ’ cards			1
but he did say sorry to the victims of the 1982 @entity36 bombing , which killed four soldiers , because chief suspect @entity38 was mistakenly given a ‘ comfort letter ’ in 2007 which led to the collapse of his @entity42 murder trial in february last year			0
last night , those who lost loved ones in @entity10 atrocities said they were ‘ disgusted ’ with mr @entity0			1
@entity46 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , whose uncle @entity49 , 39 , was gunned down in cold blood outside his shop by masked republican terrorists , said : ‘ @entity0 wo n’t talk to the victims but he ’ll happily sit down with @entity56 and the @entity10 and do deals			1
‘ we are the ones still grieving and they get a pat on the back			0
’ mr @entity0 , who is the @entity65 ’s @entity64 peace envoy , gave evidence to mps about the ‘ on the runs ’ programme after evading an appearance for more than nine months			2
during a heated two - hour session , mr @entity0 was told the ‘ unsavoury ’ scheme , drawn up following pressure from @entity56 leaders @entity75 and @entity76 , had left victims feeling ‘ hurt and betrayed ’			2
but the former @entity78 said the letters were ‘ absolutely critical ’ to the peace process and an ‘ essential component ’ in getting @entity56 to accept an overhauled police service in @entity2			1
he said talks were on a ‘ knife - edge ’ before the establishment of a power - sharing government in @entity87 between the @entity88 and @entity56			0
‘ if i had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all … i think it is likely that the peace process would have collapsed , ’ he said			1
‘ i wanted to put the death , destruction , terrorism and misery to an end			0
i could n’t bring back those people who had died during the @entity99 but i was trying to make sure there would not be further victims			0
’ ' i wanted to put the death , destruction , terrorism and misery to an end ' : mr @entity0 refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients ‘ get out of jail free ’ cards peace process : mr @entity0 , left , with @entity56 leader @entity75 , right , and chief negotiator @entity76 in 10 @entity113 in 2005			1
he said the pair pressured him for the amnesty for paramilitaries as part of the peace deal , @entity10 terrorists serving prison terms were granted early release that could not apply to those on the run			2
but a controversial agreement was reached between mr @entity0 and @entity56 whereby checks would be carried out and those who were no longer wanted by police would be sent a letter informing them of that fact			0
mr @entity0 insisted the scheme was ‘ not secret ’ , even though leading @entity2 politicians , including @entity133 , who was @entity134 from 1998 to 2002 , and senior police chiefs in the province were unaware of it			2
the comfort letters came to light only when @entity38 ’s trial was halted			0
mr @entity0 said yesterday : ‘ for that , i take responsibility and i apologise to those who have suffered			0
’ but he added : ‘ i ’m not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received them because without them we would not have had peace			0

@entity0 insists peace process would have collapsed without the scheme
it assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters they were free men
relatives of @entity10 victims say they are ' disgusted ' with the @entity78
