by @entity0 published : 02:40 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 02:40 est , 13 june 2013 prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty for @entity3 despite a jury being unable to reach a verdict on whether she should be executed			1
@entity7 , a former waitress from @entity8 , was found guilty last month of killing @entity3 , whose body was found slumped in the shower of his @entity12 - area home in june 2008			1
he had been stabbed 27 times , had his throat slashed and was shot in the face			0
prosecutors have revealed they will still pursue a death penalty for @entity3 , pictured here before the jury 's non-decision in her sentencing was handed down @entity7 says the killing was self - defense , and that on the day of @entity26 's death , he attacked her and she was forced to fight for her life			1
however , no other evidence - other than @entity7 ' accounts - has been presented at trial showing @entity26 had ever been physically violent			1
authorities say @entity7 planned the attack			1
she initially denied involvement then blamed it on masked intruders			0
two years after her arrest , she said it was self - defense			1
following the deadlock , the jury foreman claimed he is has been threatened with hate mail , with strangers saying they will kill him for failing to sentence @entity7 to death			1
' today i read hate mail my dad had gotten , ' the son of foreman @entity46 wrote on his blog			0
' some person had sent him a threatening message complete with his email address , full name , and phone number ( which at the very least means that this guy should retake @entity58 101 )			0
' heartbroken : @entity3 's relatives , including his sister @entity60 ( right ) were a constant presence at the trial and they were moved to tears when they heard that it would drag on for more months the state of @entity68 now has the option of retrying the sentencing phase of the trial , which would require a new jury be empanelled , @entity66 reported			1
if there is another deadlock , a judge would sentence @entity7 to natural life in prison , or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years			1
@entity81 attorney @entity80 told reporters prosecutors would ask a new sentencing jury to do what the previous one could not - put @entity7 to death			1
' at this point , we are still preparing to move forward to retry the penalty phase , ' @entity80 told a news conference			0
new target : @entity46 ' @entity91 has received death threats in the wake of the @entity3 trail where he and the other jury members failed to punish her with the death penalty mr @entity46 has previously explained that the jury aced a decision that was wrenching and real , with implications that could haunt them forever			1
he said the jury struggled with one specific question in their private deliberations : how heinous of a killing deserves a similar fate ? ' the system we think is flawed in that sense because this was not a case of a @entity111 or @entity112 , ' @entity46 told @entity113			2
' it was a brutal no - win situation			2
... i think that 's kind of unfair , ' the 69 - year - old added			2
' we 're not lawyers			0
we ca n't interpret the law			0
and i will tell you i 've never felt more mere as a mortal than i felt for the last five months			0
' @entity46 said the most difficult time of the entire trial was hearing directly from victim 's family as his brother and sister tearfully explained how his killing has shattered their lives			2
' there was no sound in that jury room for a long time after that because you hurt so bad for these people , ' he said			0
' but that was n't evidence			0
that 's what made it so hard ...			0
this was n't about them			0
this was a decision whether we 're going to tell somebody they were going to be put to death or spend the rest of their life in prison			2
' @entity46 described a deliberations room full of tears and spinning moral compasses as each juror struggled to come to grips with their own beliefs about what factors - including @entity7 ' young age at the time of the killing and her lack of criminal history - should cause them to show mercy and spare her life			1
' you 've got @entity3 's family devastated , that he was killed , that he was brutally killed			2
you 've got @entity3 ' family sitting in there , both families sitting and seeing these humiliating images and listening to unbelievably lurid private details of their lives , and you 've got a woman whose life is over , too , ' @entity172 said			1
' i mean , who 's winning in this situation ? and we were stuck in the middle			0
' @entity46 declined to discuss his thoughts or those of other jurors on whether @entity7 should have been sentenced to death or life			1
but he said he was torn between her two personas : a killer and an average young woman struggling through life			2
' you heard ( prosecutor @entity198 ) @entity197 say she was only 27 ...			0
she 's old enough that she should have known better , ' @entity172 said			0
' i did n't look at it that way			0
i 'm looking at 27 years of an absolutely normal everyday young woman that was living a life that was perfectly normal			2
' then something changed the trajectory of her life after meeting @entity3 , and it spiraled downhill from there			1

state of @entity68 now has the option of retrying the sentencing
if there is another deadlock , a judge would jail @entity7 for life
