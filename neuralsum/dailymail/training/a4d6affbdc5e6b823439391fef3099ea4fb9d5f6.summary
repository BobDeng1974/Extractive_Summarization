at another , in @entity38 , near @entity39 , in november , several of the country ’s most senior officers took part in an outdoor demonstration			2

shaped like an over-sized sci - fi gun , the yellow and black device can be strapped across the user ’s chest and emits a ‘ very intense ’ sound beam			1
the specific wavelength of the beam fools the brain into thinking that the sound is much louder than it really is			1
powerful : one of the unofficial guinea pigs said : ' it felt like there was something inside my head , i felt a bit nauseous , and all i wanted to do was get away from it ' officials believe the maximum safe exposure is 115 decibels , equal to a power saw or rock concert , over the period of a minute			0
the weapon comes with a laser sight , display indicating length of exposure and battery life and a video camera which records images of who it is used against			0
it is being developed by @entity126 , which named the weapon @entity127 , @entity129			1

‘ we are still developing it and the reason we are still getting feedback from the police			0
it ’s not available for sale at the moment			0
’ a @entity27 spokesman said : ‘ we constantly consider and review less lethal options which may be suitable for the police to use			0
‘ all equipment is subject to a rigorous testing and approval process including technical , medical and operational evaluations before it is considered for use			0
