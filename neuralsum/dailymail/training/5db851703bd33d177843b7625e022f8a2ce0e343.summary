by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 03:56 est , 19 march 2013 storm surges as devastating as those caused by @entity3 could happen 10 times more often if global temperatures rise by just two degrees , new research warns			1
an estimated 1,836 people lost their lives and millions more were left homeless by the cyclone , the worst to ever hit the @entity9 , after it submerged @entity11 and other @entity13 communities in 2005			1
much of the devastation was caused by storm surges whipped up by fierce winds , which saw sea levels rise by between 24 and 28 feet along a 20 - mile stretch of the @entity20 coast			0
devastating : a @entity22 truck sits flooded with other vehicles in front of a hotel just off @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity20 , as @entity3 battered the area in august 2005 a 27.8ft surge at @entity30 , @entity20 was the highest recorded in @entity9 history			1
the new research suggests that even moderate climate change is likely to make such extreme storm surges as much as 10 times more frequent than they are today			2
since 1923 , there has been a @entity3 - magnitude storm surge roughly every 20 years			1
researchers calculated that with less than half a @entity40 of global warming , this frequency would double			2
a @entity43 rise produces a three to four-fold rate increase and if temperatures rise by @entity48 - the ' safe ' limit for temperature change set by climate experts - extreme storm surges will become 10 times more common			1
submerged : floodwaters from @entity3 flow over a levee along @entity53 near downtown @entity11			2
some 1,836 people were killed and millions more left homeless by the cyclone shocking new images revealed by @entity57 show the @entity58 is becoming lusher and greener as temperatures rise			1
' vegetation growth at @entity62 's northern latitudes increasingly resembles lusher latitudes to the south ' the agency said after releasing a new study based on a 30 - year record of land surface and newly improved satellite data sets			0
the images show how the extreme of the @entity71 is changing , with previously frozen areas now showing lush green grass and trees growing			0
show temperature and vegetation growth at northern latitudes now resemble those found 4 degrees to 6 degrees of latitude farther south as recently as 1982 , researchers found			0
' this means there will be a @entity3 magnitude storm surge every other year , ' said @entity83 climate scientist dr @entity82 , from the @entity84 , who led the research			1
the study compared historical storm surges with a range of different climate model predictions , taking into account natural phenomena such as @entity92 , which warms the eastern @entity93 and affects global temperature			0
' we find that 0.4 degrees @entity40 warming of the climate corresponds to a doubling of the frequency of extreme storm surges like the one following @entity3 , ' said dr @entity82			1
' with the global warming we have had during the 20th century , we have already crossed the threshold where more than half of all " @entity105 " are due to global warming			0
' if the temperature rises an additional degree , the frequency will increase three to four times and if the global climate becomes two degrees warmer , there will be about 10 times as many extreme storm surges			2
' he added that under normal conditions sea levels around the world were expected to rise as a result of global warming , making storm surges even more extreme and destructive			0
findings were reported in the journal @entity123 .			0

two degrees *celsius* warming is the ' safe limit ' set by climate scientists
storms as severe as the 2005 cyclone could happen once every two years
@entity3 killed 1,836 and left millions homeless
