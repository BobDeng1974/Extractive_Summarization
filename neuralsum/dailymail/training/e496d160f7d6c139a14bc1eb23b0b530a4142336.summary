by @entity0 door trouble : @entity3 's getaway was thwarted when he had trouble distinguishing the difference between push and pull in the cut and thrust of armed robbery , negotiating a door is likely to be the least of your problems			1
however , it was a door that led to the undoing of criminal @entity3 when he had trouble working out which way it opened			1
in a scene which could have come straight from the film @entity22 , the robber 's getaway was thwarted when he failed to distinguish the difference between the door 's ' push ' and ' pull ' mechanism			1
described by his own lawyer as ' bumbling and incompetent ' , @entity3 spent some time grappling with the complex device before losing his cool			1
out of frustration , the 28 - year - old took off his balaclava - only to reveal his face to the store 's cctv camera			0
@entity3 then kicked a panel near the door , smashing it in two , and knocked over a display before falling to the ground			1
he then demanded shop manager @entity40 let him out			1
the embarrassing blunder mirrors a scene from the 2000 crime film @entity22 , where two robbers make a disastrous attempt at raiding a bookies			1
as they try to make their escape by pushing a door that wo n't open , they both collapse , exhausted , on the floor and take off their balaclavas in full view of the cctv camera			0
however , the door then opens inwardly into the shop , pushed by a customer on the other side			2
@entity3 was jailed for three years at @entity58 for the raid on the @entity61 newsagents , in @entity62 , @entity63 on march 2			2
@entity3 , of no fixed abode , ran off with just £ 134.98 after holding the shop up with a toy gun and ordering the till to be emptied			1
he admitted robbing ms @entity40 and possession of an imitation firearm , being jailed for three years for the robbery and two years for possession of an imitation firearm , to run concurrently			0
on screen stupidity : a scene from @entity22 where robbers try to escape by pushing a door that opens inwards busted : the exhausted pair take off their masks ... and realise the game is up when a @entity80 camera captures their faces a customer of the betting shop opens the door from the other side ... simply by pushing it after ms @entity40 had to open the door for him , @entity3 ran off and was found by police in the same road three hours later with the balaclava in his pocket and having thrown the weapon in a nearby bin			1
@entity94 , prosecuting , told the court : ' when he was put in the back of the police car he immediately started to cry , told police he needed to pay the rent , and said : " i ’m sorry , it ’s not fair on them - are they alright ? "			0
' the court heard that @entity3 , who had no previous convictions , had developed a @entity106 drug addiction three years previously which had left him in debt to drug dealers who had suggested the robbery			2
@entity110 , defending , said his client acted in desperation			0
he added : ' it was totally unsophisticated , it was bumbling and incompetent			0
his actions after the robbery demonstrated mr @entity3 is pathetic rather than callous			2
' you were only supposed to blow the bl * * dy doors off ! ' the classic scene from the 1969 @entity122 film @entity123 complex : @entity3 tried to push the door open , despite it displaying a sign reading ' pull ' jailed : @entity3 was sentenced after pleading guilty to his crime at @entity58 ( pictured ) ' he hit rock bottom , he was sleeping on sofas in crack houses			1
the drug dealers threatened him with something metal to his neck and suggested one way to pay it back would be to rob a shop and they gave him this imitation plastic toy gun			0
' @entity3 had also stolen four cheques from his father , @entity139 , two of which he made out to himself in cash , stealing £ 1,600			2
he asked for the offence to be taken into account			0
sentencing @entity3 , judge @entity144 said the defendant had expressed genuine remorse			0
he said : ' i accept you would not have acted as you did if you and your family had not been threatened with violence , but it makes no sense trying to get yourself out of trouble by doing something criminal yourself			0

he took off his balaclava and asked the shop manager to let him out
