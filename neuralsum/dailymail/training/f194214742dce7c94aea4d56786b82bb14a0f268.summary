by @entity0 and @entity1 critical : dr @entity3 has warned the prosecution of a doctor announced last week could discourage medics from treating @entity8 victims a top gynaecologist has strongly criticised the decision to prosecute a doctor for carrying out female genital mutilation			1
dr @entity3 warned that the landmark case announced last week – the first of its kind in the @entity16 – put politics before women ’s welfare and risked deterring medical staff from caring for affected women			1
on friday , the director of public prosecutions @entity22 announced that there was enough evidence to charge dr @entity26 with allegedly carrying out the practice at the @entity28 , @entity29			2
the procedure , known as @entity8 , is mostly practised on young girls as a form of circumcision in parts of @entity35 and the @entity36 , using barbaric and primitive methods			1
although it is illegal in this country , there have been reports of @entity16 girls being taken abroad by their parents to be mutilated			2
this particular case is unusual as dr @entity26 is alleged to have carried out @entity8 on a woman after she had given birth			1
the patient had already undergone the procedure when she was much younger			2
but dr @entity50 , a consultant gynaecologist and head of obstetrics at @entity53 in @entity54 , said the doctor had not actually performed @entity8 because the procedure had already taken place			1
she added that stitching done after the delivery – including to stop any bleeding – should not be seen as @entity8			1
she also accused mrs @entity22 of putting politics first and said other gynaecologists were outraged by the decision			0
writing in today ’s @entity63 , she said : ‘ if , as a result of the @entity23 ’s intervention , any post-delivery stitching or repair to a woman with @entity8 is going to be potentially considered as mutilation , then doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate before intervening			1
in certain situations , that potentially could cost a new mother her life			0
’ she added that all the cases she had seen personally had been mutilated abroad , and that she suspected the @entity76 was ‘ under pressure ’ to prosecute someone for carrying out @entity8 after all the publicity the subject had received			1
arrest : the first charges in @entity16 history for causing female genital mutilation have been brought against two men			0
one , dr @entity26 , works at the @entity28 in north @entity29 around 140million women worldwide are believed to have undergone @entity8 and campaigners hailed last week ’s prosecution as a breakthrough in ending the practice			1
forty - eight - year - old supermodel @entity90 was a victim in her native @entity91 when she was just five years old , and has openly campaigned against it			0
she said previously : ‘ this is about child protection			0
it is pure violence against girls , and it destroys their lives			0
’ appearing before mps on the @entity101 yesterday , mrs @entity22 said a lack of referrals to police was partly behind the low number of prosecutions			0
when asked why the number of referrals was so low , she said : ‘ if you wait for ... the archetypal young girl to come and tell you about what ’s just happened to her , that ’s not going to happen			0
‘ there ’s recognition we ought to be more proactive so we have been working with the police to look at leading investigations based on intelligence , which might help			0
dr @entity26 will appear before magistrates on april 15 , alongside @entity120 , 40 , who is believed to be a relative of the woman and has been charged with aiding and abetting the doctor			2
by @entity124 dr @entity3 is an eminent gynaecologist working in an area of @entity54 with a large migrant population			1
here she tackles a difficult subject with honesty and candour			0
some readers may recoil , but it ’s an issue that must be aired			0
activist : supermodel @entity90 , 48 , was a victim of @entity8 in her native @entity91 when she was just five years old , and has openly campaigned against it as a consultant gynaecologist working at an inner - city hospital in @entity29 ’s @entity137 , i ’m all too used to seeing women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation ( @entity8 )			1
@entity140 has substantial immigrant populations from @entity91 and @entity142 – two of the many countries in @entity35 and the @entity36 where @entity8 is still widely practised – and as a result many of the women who arrive at @entity147 , where i work , show the unmistakable signs of this barbaric practice			1
we see around 50 cases a year of the worst kind , so - called @entity154 , where the clitoris and inner lips ( labia minora ) of the vagina have been sliced off and the outer lips ( labia majora ) sewn together to leave only a small opening			0
all the women that i personally have seen were born abroad , and had the fgm abroad , prior to their arrival in this country			0
the challenge for their doctors and midwives is to ensure that these women are safely delivered of their babies , despite the physical obstacles presented by @entity8 , and that ’s a challenge that has just become a lot more difficult following the @entity23 ’ decision to prosecute a @entity16 hospital doctor for carrying out @entity8			1
the case in question is now sub-judice so i ca n’t comment on any clinical specifics , but what has seriously alarmed those of us working in the field is that the patient who was being treated by dr @entity26 at a @entity182 had already been subjected to @entity8			1
if , as a result of the @entity76 ’s intervention , any post-delivery stitching or repair to a woman with @entity8 is , itself , going to be potentially considered as mutilation then doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate , at the very least , before intervening			1
in certain situations , that potentially could cost a new mother her life			0
where pregnant women arrive in @entity16 hospitals having already had @entity8 , surely it ’s obvious that the only person guilty of that quite properly criminal act is whoever carried out the original mutilation			1
it ’s certainly not the doctor or midwife , who is simply trying to stop any bleeding and mend any tears after the trauma of childbirth			2
whether @entity22 , the @entity76 , felt under some pressure to bring a prosecution – any prosecution – given that she was about to appear before the @entity213 , i ca n’t really comment , although i can see mrs @entity22 might have felt the need to have something to tell @entity216			1
others , however , have already pointed out how surprising it is that despite @entity8 being made a criminal act almost 30 years ago – either for carrying it out or aiding and abetting it – there has not yet been a single prosecution in @entity16			1
or not until last week			2
under pressure ? dr @entity50 saysr @entity22 , the @entity23 , would be better off focusing ' her department ¿ s efforts on the back - street butchers who are said to carry @entity8 out in this country ' perhaps this is because , in the 21 years i ’ve worked as a gynaecologist at @entity53 , i have never seen a @entity16 - born woman who has been subjected to @entity8			1
nor have i seen a woman of any nationality on whom @entity8 has been performed in @entity16			2
indeed , the only reason i know it happens in @entity16 at all is because respected colleagues tell me it does and because friends in the teaching profession , all too used to some of their female pupils mysteriously disappearing for a couple of weeks , back them up			0
nevertheless , @entity8 in @entity16 - born women is rare so i ’m not surprised the @entity76 has found it so difficult to prosecute			1
but she needs to concentrate her department ’s efforts on the back - street butchers who are said to carry this atrocity out in this country , and on the parents who take their daughters abroad for the procedure , not on hospital doctors and midwives who are simply doing what they ’ve been trained to do			2
most pregnant women with @entity254 who are seen at hospitals like mine are offered a procedure called ‘ a defibulation ’ in advance of their due date , during which the often tiny opening left by @entity8 is widened to accommodate the safe delivery of a baby			2
it ’s a procedure that only needs to be performed once , before the delivery of the woman ’s first baby , because after the baby has been born the vaginal opening will now be of normal dimensions			0
but some pregnant women with @entity154 choose not to have a defibulation in advance , either through fear , embarrassment or simply because they prefer to have all the medical intervention required for the birth carried out at once			0
in these cases , doctors and midwives can only start to intervene when the woman arrives at the hospital having gone into labour			0
court hearing : the pair who have been charged are due to appear before @entity286 any birth can be traumatic but one that starts in these complex , challenging circumstances , particularly so			0
a defibulation has to be carried out on a woman who is already in labour and , as a result , once the baby has been delivered , the area around the vagina – newly operated upon , of course – will be raw , sore and bleeding			0
the new mother urgently needs stitches or , in some cases , there is a real risk she could bleed to death			0
my concern is that following the @entity76 ’s decision to prosecute a @entity16 hospital doctor , doctors and midwives will think twice about doing what they know to be medically right			1
stitching up a woman who has had @entity8 after she has given birth is not the same as carrying out the mutilation itself , and it ’s outrageous that the two things could possibly be confused			1
now it may be that there are facts in the @entity76 ’s prosecution that have not yet emerged : as i ’ve already said , i can not comment on a particular case			2
but the @entity76 and the @entity324 need to move quickly to end the confusion and make the general principle clear			2
stitching up a bleeding woman who has previously been subjected to @entity8 is not the same as committing @entity8 itself			2
these poor women who come into our hospitals have already suffered enough – they ’ve been mutilated , and then go through the trauma of childbirth			0
they need to be looked after by doctors and midwives who can confidently get on with what they ’ve been trained to do , rather than looking nervously over their shoulders to see if a policeman has just walked into the delivery suite clutching a pair of handcuffs			0

@entity76 said last week that she was to prosecute doctor for carrying out @entity8
but gynaecologist @entity3 says the doctor did not carry it out
@entity350 could deter medics from repairing @entity8 *damage* , she says
