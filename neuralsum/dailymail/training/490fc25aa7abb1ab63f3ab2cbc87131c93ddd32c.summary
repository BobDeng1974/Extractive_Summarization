by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 2 october 2013 a large cluster of jellyfish has forced one of the world ’s largest nuclear reactors to shut down after it caused a blockage in the pipes			1
@entity9 nuclear plant closed its third reactor for the second time in one weekend after a giant wave of jellyfish clogged the pipes that bring in cool water to the plant 's turbines			1
the plant in southeastern @entity19 closed @entity20 , which at 1,400 megawatts of output is the largest boiling - water reactor in the world			1
nuclear reaction : @entity9 , southeastern @entity19 closed @entity20 the largest boiling - water reactor in the world , as a result of the jellyfish invasion this is not the first time operators at @entity9 have been forced to close reactors due to jellyfish , and marine biologists say could become more common across the globe			1
by tuesday , the pipes had been cleaned of the jellyfish and engineers were preparing to restart the reactor , said @entity38 , a spokesman for @entity39 , the plant operator			1
‘ this is not unusual , ' he told local newspaper @entity41			0
‘ it has previously struck @entity42 and @entity43 when we had surface water intake			0
' ‘ there are filters to stop this and we have all the reason to consider what we can do to prevent this			0
it is a known problem , but the issue is that it was such enormous quantities this time			0
’ all three @entity56 reactors are boiling - water types , the same technology at @entity61 's @entity60 plant that suffered a catastrophic failure in 2011 after a tsunami breached the facility 's walls and flooded its equipment			2
dangerous wobbles : tons of jellyfish blocked the pipes used to cool the reactor 's turbines , a phenomenon that marine biologists say could become more common last year the @entity77 - based @entity76 facility had to shut its reactor two after gobs of sea salp - a gelatinous , jellyfish - like organism - clogged intake pipes			1
in 2005 , the first unit at @entity9 was temporarily turned off due to a sudden jellyfish influx			2
nuclear power plants need a constant flow of water to cool their reactor and turbine systems , which is why many such plants are built near large bodies of water			2
marine biologists , meanwhile , say they would not be surprised if more jellyfish shutdowns occur in the future			0
‘ it 's true that there seems to be more and more of these extreme cases of blooming jellyfish , ’ said @entity96 , a researcher at the @entity97 for the @entity98			2
‘ but it 's very difficult to say if there are more jellyfish , because there is no historical data			0
’ @entity96 said the biggest problem was that there 's no monitoring of jellyfish in the @entity111 to produce the data that scientists need to figure out how to tackle the issue .			0

@entity19 nuclear plant @entity9 was forced to close a reactor
jellyfish had blocked the pipes cooling down the plant 's turbines
after three days of cleaning reactor @entity20 *reopened* on tuesday
