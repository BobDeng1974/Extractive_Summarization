by @entity1 reporter @entity2 may be forgetful , but when it comes to classical music , it seems they know what they like			2
they can distinguish between a piece by 18th century @entity12 composer @entity11 and one by 20th century @entity14 @entity13 , a study found			1
@entity16 researchers played goldfish @entity18 and @entity13 ’s @entity19			1
they trained four of them to bite a red bead on hearing one piece , but not the other			2
holy mackerel ! goldfish have evolved to develop similar hearing mechanisms as seemingly far more complex animals , said researchers who painstakingly trained them to tell the difference between @entity11 and @entity13 professor @entity30 , from the department of psychology at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity16 , said goldfish have evolved to develop similar hearing mechanisms as seemingly far more complex animals			1
he said : ‘ humans ... can easily recognise and enjoy a variety of types of music			2
‘ several studies have investigated whether these properties of music exist in non-human animals			0
‘ goldfish are known as a hearing specialist species , since they have evolved a structure to enhance auditory signals detected by the inner ear			0
‘ this suggests that goldfish have evolved specific features for hearing and can recognise complex auditory stimuli similar to those recognised by modern vertebrates			0
’ the researchers carried out several experiments , and eventually trained four goldfish to either bite the bead to one piece of music and to do nothing when the other was playing			0
the fish were able to distinguish between the music around three quarters of the time			1
but they were not fast learners – it took more than 100 training sessions before they were able to distinguish the pieces			1
the scientists also tested to see whether the fish would recognise other pieces by the same composers that they had never heard before			1
however found they did not appear to recognise them and instead the fish swam around randomly			2
academic fishing expedition : like humans , the fish did seem to show some individual tastes – one fish avoided music by @entity11 , left , and preferred @entity13 , right , while another fish avoided @entity13 , the study found in another experiment involving six different goldfish , the scientists found the animals did not appear to show any strong preference for a particular type of music			1
however , like humans , the fish did seem to show some individual tastes – one fish avoided @entity11 ’s music and preferred @entity13 while another of the fish avoided @entity13			1
professor @entity30 added : ‘ for those subjects , the musical stimuli might have a certain kind of reinforcing properties , although it was not consistent among individuals			0
‘ on the other hand , three of the six subjects did not show any preferences for areas of the tank in which music was presented			0
’ the findings go some way to disproving myths that suggest goldfish are relatively simple creatures with low levels of intelligence			0
according to popular myth they have a memory span of only 15 seconds			0
but recent research has suggested that goldfish can have a memory span of up to three months .			0

they even developed *personal* tastes , claims study by @entity16 team
