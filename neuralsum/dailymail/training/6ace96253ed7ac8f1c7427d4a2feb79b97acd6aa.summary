@entity0 has banned all imports of @entity3 cheese after its inspectors condemned hygiene standards at just one @entity3 dairy			1
the ban , imposed three days ago , has sparked outrage and one mp has demanded ‘ tit for tat ’ retaliation against @entity0 food imports			0
the cheese factory has not been identified but @entity14 has learned it does not even export cheese to @entity0			1
@entity15 : @entity0 has banned all imports of @entity3 cheese after its inspectors condemned hygiene standards at just one @entity3 dairy there is no evidence the factory broke any @entity3 regulations and last night @entity22 , farming minister , said @entity0 ’s ban was ‘ disappointing ’			1
he said : ' @entity3 cheese is the best in the world and produced to the highest safety and quality standards so it is disappointing that @entity0 have put a temporary block on cheese imports			1
' food inspectors will now visit all factories exporting cheese to @entity0 to demonstrate their high standards so these restrictions can be lifted as soon as possible			0
' @entity35 , conservative mp for @entity36 and @entity37 , who is secretary of the @entity38 , said : ‘ we have some of the highest food production standards in the world as well as the world ’s finest cheeses			0
‘ it seems to me this is a complete over-reaction and a disproportionate response especially as the plant involved does not even export cheese to @entity0			2
‘ this matter needs to be resolved quickly and if it is not we should look at the possibility of some retaliatory action			0
’ probe : environment secretary @entity52 has asked officials to discover what went wrong he added : ‘ attacking the @entity3 cheese industry is like us attacking the @entity0 noodle industry and on the basis of just one visit to a @entity3 dairy producer i think it ’s offensive			1
’ @entity0 inspectors were in @entity3 in march and asked to visit a cheese factory			1
this was arranged by officials at the @entity67 and industry body @entity68 , which assumed it was a general visit			0
but on arrival at the plant , the @entity0 conducted a full - blown audit and then suspended all @entity3 cheese imports from may 1			1
the @entity0 inspection report has not been published , but @entity75 , which works on behalf of @entity3 ’s dairy farmers , has said the @entity0 were concerned about maintenance of equipment , air sanitation , temperatures of raw milk during transportation and chemical storage			2
government and industry sources insist the issues were minor and posed no threat to public health			1
but the ban will remain until the eight @entity3 plants that export cheese to @entity0 have been checked for compliance			1
environmental health officers are now inspecting these dairies on behalf of the @entity95 in the hope of persuading @entity0 to lift the ban			2
the watchdog has also asked officers to visit the plant that sparked the cheese ban to ensure any shortcomings are addressed			0
environment secretary @entity52 , who has visited @entity0 twice in the past 18 months to drum up new exports for food and drink companies , has asked officials to discover what went wrong			0
a @entity109 source said : ‘ everything is being gone through with a fine - tooth comb to ensure it does n’t happen again			0
’ disappointed : there is no evidence the factory broke any @entity3 regulations and last night @entity22 , farming minister , said @entity0 's ban was ' disappointing ' what is particularly galling for @entity3 is that @entity120 factories inspected by the @entity0 in april have been approved to export cheese			1
farming and industry figures fear the @entity120 are now better placed to win new @entity0 orders			2
while the @entity0 market is tiny , the ban has coincided with a sharp increase in demand this year			0
export figures for january and february alone are already valued at £ 93,003			0
the @entity0 government bodies responsible for the ban – the @entity132 and the @entity133 and @entity134 – did not respond to requests for comment from @entity14 yesterday .			2
