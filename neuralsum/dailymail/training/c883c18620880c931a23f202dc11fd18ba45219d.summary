@entity0 today faced questions over how much he is worth as the @entity3 leader tried to play down claims he was targeting @entity6 ’s background for political advantage			1
the morning after his widely - praised conference speech , mr @entity0 was forced to defend claims the prime minister would personally benefit from a ‘ tax cut for millionaires ’ but refused to discuss his own levels of personal wealth			1
in his speech , mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity6 is n’t just writing the cheques			2
he ’s going to be getting the millionaire ’s tax cut			2
labour leader @entity0 toured the tv studios today to face questions about his conference speech in @entity23 ‘ so next week maybe mr @entity6 can tell us how much is he awarding himself in a tax cut ? how much is that tax cut he is awarding himself ? ’ but he appeared to row back from the claim today , after business experts accused him of confusing people with net assets worth more than £ 1million with the much smaller group who earn seven - figure sums every year			1
asked on @entity34 how much he was worth , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ i am not going to be getting the top rate tax cut			1
’ but pressed on whether he was ‘ worth £ 1million ’ , mr @entity0 looked panicked and tried to claim he was not using the prime minister ’s upbringing to gain votes			1
‘ i am not making an issue of @entity6 ’s background			2
’ mr @entity0 , whose @entity42 home is reportedly worth £ 1.6million , criticised the prime minister for cutting the top - rate of tax and said he did n't think " it was the kind of country we should be in "			1
but in the same interview he attacked mr @entity6 for cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p for those earning more than £ 150,000 , and claimed the pm will benefit personally			1
‘ mr @entity6 's aides have said he will be receiving a tax cut in the top rate of tax when it is cut from 50 to 45 per cent , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ why does that matter ? that matters because if you 're the prime minister and you 're cutting taxes for a very small section of the population and raising them for everyone else			2
‘ you 're cutting taxes for the richest in society			0
i think that 's wrong , i do n't think that 's the kind of country we should be in			0
' @entity0 was joined on the conference stage by his wife @entity69 after his speech yesterday mr @entity0 ’s speech was packed with references to his own upbringing , attending a comprehensive school in @entity75 , which was seen as an attempt to contrast with mr @entity6 ’s schooling at @entity78			2
he said that as a pupil at @entity83 he ‘ learned how to get on with people from all backgrounds , whoever they were ’			0
@entity85 mps have accused the @entity3 leader of indulging in ‘ class war ’ by making a big play of his educational background to contrast with @entity6 ’s @entity78 schooling			1
@entity91 said it was ‘ a bit rich ’ for him to pretend he is from a down - to - earth background when his family were very wealthy and came from the ‘ @entity3 elite ’			0
four of mr @entity0 ’s shadow cabinet colleagues – including @entity98 and @entity99 – were privately educated			0
mr @entity0 received largely positive coverage for yesterday ’s speech , delivered without notes or an autocue			0
today he revealed that the 65 - minute address had been longer than he originally planned			1
‘ the notes for the speech , such that they were , were 6,000 words and i delivered 7,500 , ’ he told @entity105			0
‘ people are fed up with politics which feels like it is reading out something that someone else has written for you			0
i tried to say what i believed and that is the best thing to do			0
’ despite using much of the speech to distance himself from @entity3 , attacking its failures on welfare and immigration , mr @entity0 said he was ' flattered ' at being compared to @entity123			1
' i think i ’m pretty flattered by that comparison , @entity123 was incredible at conference speeches			0
but it ’s a different time			0
' what i do feel , the reason i did that speech yesterday , was that people want to know about who the person is , where we 're going to take the country			0

the @entity3 leader looks *uncomfortable* as he *challenged* on tv over how much he is worth
after 65 - minute speech attacking out - of - touch @entity142 , @entity0 now denies ' making an issue ' of @entity6 's background
@entity147 home is worth £ 1.6million , but he says he will not benefit in the tax cut for top earners
party chief says he is ' flattered ' by comparisons with former prime minister @entity123
