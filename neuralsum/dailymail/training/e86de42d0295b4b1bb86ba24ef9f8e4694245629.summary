by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 6 august 2012 updated : 11:35 est , 6 august 2012 @entity2 , gritty , bland … there ’s no worse start to your morning than a terrible cup of coffee			1
indeed , making the perfect cup can be so difficult that many choose the easy option and make a tea instead			1
@entity12 cuppa : you can say goodbye to terrible coffee but , thanks to the clever people at @entity20 @entity19 , help is at hand – with an app that turns you from coffee novice to world - class barista in a matter of seconds			1
oh , and did i mention it ’s free ? with the @entity31 app , available for the @entity32 , it gives users the expertise and the knowledge to create the perfect cup of coffee every time – based on taste and strength preferences			1
it works by giving users the optimal brewing time and measurement of coffee to suit their need state			2
it also features an integrated timer that alerts the user when the coffee has reached the ideal brew time and the cafetière is ready to be plunged			0
once the perfect cup has been mastered , the app allows users to share their new expertise and achievements via @entity56 and @entity57 with a series of accomplishment and skill badges			1
so , for fans of @entity62 and @entity63 , think of it as ‘ levelling up ’ your brewing skill			0
maybe even adding ‘ +2 ’ plunging ability			0
it ’s also packed with tips , hints and coffee facts along with a series of instructive videos and exclusive money - off coupons			2
so , is it any good ? well , before this app , i always ‘ took the plunge ’ far too early			0
this resulted in a weak , watery beverage with as much drink appeal as pond water			0
but it loses points as it ’s just on the @entity32 – which may leave a bitter taste in the mouths of @entity89 and other smartphone users			0
still , there 's always tea ? follow @entity0 on @entity57 : @ @entity92 and on @entity56 : @entity93 .			2

turns you from coffee novice to world - class barista in a matter of seconds
' teaches ' you how to make the perfect cup of coffee
*fun* ' levelling - up ' *system* allows you to earn badges and show off your skills on @entity56
