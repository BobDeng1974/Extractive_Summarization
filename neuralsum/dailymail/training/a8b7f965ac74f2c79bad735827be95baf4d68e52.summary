this has been close to the perfect test for @entity2			1
you can not complain about anything they have done from the start until the end of the fourth day			0
it was absolutely fitting that @entity9 should end up with a five - wicket haul on his 32nd birthday and @entity2 ’s bowlers have been very clever in the way they have used the short ball in this game			1
in the second test at @entity17 , they bowled short with the occasional full delivery but here they bowled full with the occasional short one , and that ’s the way it is supposed to be			1
the captaincy of @entity25 has been good and he seems to have learned from the mistakes he made against @entity28 when he had everyone back			2
and the fact that they got the last two first innings wickets quickly meant that @entity25 did not have to go into bat with a scrambled brain , having been held up by tail - enders for three or four hours			2
he could run off and focus on his batting			0
the decision to bat again rather than enforce the follow on was a 50 - 50 one for me , because i think @entity2 would still win had they sent @entity33 back in again because the ball was swinging around yesterday morning			1
if everyone had been fit and firing and all four seamers were contributing , i would have sent them in again but because of the simple need to rest the big two - @entity9 and @entity57 - because of the drop - off between them and the next two - @entity60 and @entity61 - it was absolutely the right decision from @entity25			1
impressive : @entity63 ( centre ) has really improved his spin bowling and is starting to look impressive solid : debutant wicketkeeper @entity67 has been magnificent behind the stumps for @entity2 @entity2 batted at the right tempo in their second innings			1
you do not tee off from ball one in a test match			2
you have to play yourself in			0
and the declaration was absolutely spot on too			0
i would have done it no sooner nor later			0
then @entity2 showed considerable energy in the field after four long , hot days			2
for your opening bowler to be able to run in from square leg and pull off a run - out from a direct hit was outstanding , as was the sight of another fast bowler in @entity85 taking such a sharp diving catch at slip			0
there are some real pluses coming out of this game			0
@entity63 ’s bowling is getting better and @entity67 ’s wicketkeeping has been excellent			1
hopefully the mental baggage and scarring of the winter is easing and the senior players can go from strength to strength now with the junior ones working around them			0
slip : @entity2 pace bowler @entity60 made a terrific diving catch to dismiss @entity101 @entity102 : @entity2 are closing in on victory over @entity33 and it could help to remove the baggage of a torrid winter			1

@entity25 's captaincy has been excellent throughout the third test
@entity63 's bowling is improving and @entity67 's keeping has been good
@entity2 have bowled full with the occasional short ball which has worked
it was fitting that @entity9 should get a five - for on his 32nd birthday
@entity2 must finish off @entity33 and then move on from baggage of winter
