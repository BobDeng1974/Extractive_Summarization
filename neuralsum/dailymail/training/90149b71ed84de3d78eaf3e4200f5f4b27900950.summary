by @entity0 published : 19:24 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 12 june 2013 lecture : @entity3 @entity2 , 65 , accuse his own generation of taking too much from society baby boomers should take less from society because they are now ‘ absorbing ’ too much taxpayers ’ money , a senior @entity7 cleric has said			1
those born in the post-war period are the ‘ fortunate generation ’ because they enjoyed huge improvements in standards of living during their lifetimes , said the @entity18 , the @entity3 @entity2			1
but there were ‘ severe questions ’ about the share of government spending allocated to the group , he said			1
at the age of 65 , the @entity25 is a classic member of the very group he criticises , but he said that many now believe the best times could be ‘ behind us ’			2
he said the first years of the 21st century had seen a dramatic transformation and likened them to the unstable period in the run - up to the @entity34			2
making his comments in a lecture organised by religious broadcaster and publisher @entity38 , the @entity18 added fuel to the debate over whether the elderly can be protected from further austerity cuts			1
last week shadow chancellor @entity44 sparked fury when he announced that @entity46 would cap state pensions			2
@entity48 took as his theme for the lecture the meaning of @entity53 ’s @entity52 , arguing that the poem ’s image of building a better future ‘ in @entity58 ’s green and pleasant land ’ could still be achieved , but not necessarily in purely economic terms			2
‘ much of that is absorbed by the fortunate generation to which i belong in ways which raise questions – severe questions – of intergenerational equity , ’ he said			1
‘ the world is being rebalanced : economic and military ’s power is shifting eastward , the period of unchallengeable western hegemony after 250 years is at an end			0
‘ previous periods marked by the rise of new powers have led to war			0
lucky generation : the @entity25 said baby boomers are the fortunate ones thanks to the huge improvements in life quality they have enjoyed ‘ we only have to think back to the disastrous @entity83 civil war of 1914 - 1918 to realise the truth that even the interdependent character of the modern global economy is no insurance against mutually destructive conflict			1
’ he added that in current times the government ’s financial clout remains ‘ massive ’ , with public spending rising from around £ 26 billion in 1997 to nearly £ 695 billion last year			0
but figures published by the @entity94 last year showed that while elderly people make up about 15 per cent of the population in the leading economies , they account for 40 per cent of all public social spending			0
welfare for @entity101 pensioners accounts for about £ 110 billion of the total £ 165 billion spent on benefits			0
in contrast to the bishop ’s views , a study by the @entity107 , commissioned by @entity108 , concluded that over- 65s are aiding economic recovery			0
it argued that , rather than draining resources , the ‘ silver pound ’ pumps billions into the economy .			0
