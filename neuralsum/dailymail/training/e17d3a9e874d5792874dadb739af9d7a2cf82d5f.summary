the owner of a hotel in @entity3 's @entity2 that had the dubious honor of topping @entity6 's 2011 list of @entity8 's dirtiest hotels can not sue the travel website operator for defamation , a federal appeals court has ruled			1
owner @entity12 complained in a $ 10 million lawsuit that the ranking for his @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity3 was the product of a flawed rating system dependent on ‘ unsubstantiated rumors , ’ and intended to irreparably damage his business and reputation			1
@entity6 , a travel website , said the ranking was based on traveler ratings for cleanliness			2
owner @entity12 complained in a $ 10 million lawsuit that the ranking for his @entity14 and @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity3 was the product of a flawed rating system dependent on ' unsubstantiated rumors ' but the 6th @entity8 @entity31 in @entity32 on wednesday said travelers could not reasonably interpret the ranking as a statement that @entity14 was in fact ‘ @entity8 's dirtiest hotel , ’ and that website operators deserve broad protection from lawsuits over reader - generated reviews			1
while the hotel 's entry had a photo of a ripped bedspread and a complaint from a @entity6 user about ‘ dirt at least ( 1/2 - inch ) thick in the bathtub which was filled with lots of dark hair , ’ circuit judge @entity41 said no one would view this to conclusively mean the hotel deserved its ranking			1
she also said ‘ dirtiest ’ amounted to ‘ rhetorical hyperbole , ’ and that the general tenor of the list - including reader comments about other hotels such as ‘ probably more sanitary to sleep in the bathroom ’ and ‘ camp out on the beach instead ’ - showed that the list also served to entertain			0
@entity14 's ranking ‘ is not capable of being understood as defamatory , ’ @entity41 wrote for a unanimous three - judge panel			2
of the 321 reviews on @entity6 , 265 rated the hotel as ' poor ' or ' terrible ' and posted unflattering photos including this one of a ripped bedsheet a judge has ruled that the dubious @entity14 's ranking on @entity6 ' is not capable of being understood as defamatory ' ‘ even the most careless reader must have perceived that “ dirtiest ” is simply an exaggeration and that @entity14 is not , literally , the dirtiest hotel in the @entity8			1
’ @entity41 also said the prevalence of lists on the web - such as ' @entity78 , ' and a @entity80 poll calling actor @entity81 the most trusted person in @entity8 and ' judge @entity83 more trusted than any of the nine @entity85 justices - reasonably suggests that such lists are opinion , not fact			0
wednesday 's decision upheld an august 2012 ruling by @entity8 district judge @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity3			2
the @entity93 also upheld @entity91 ' refusal to let @entity12 add claims of trade libel and interference with prospective business			0
' it is a victory for online review sites by letting them not only publish user comments but also draw conclusions , ' said @entity104 , director of the @entity105 at @entity106 , which filed a legal brief supporting @entity6			0
a judge ruled that ' dirtiest ' was simply an exaggeration and the hotel can not be interpreted as literally ' the dirtiest hotel in the @entity8 ' following a host of negative reviews on @entity6 , the @entity14 and @entity15 closed late last year ' this helps journalists and researchers who work with user - submitted data to inform the public			1
' @entity120 , a lawyer for @entity12 , did not immediately respond to requests for comment			0
@entity12 could not immediately be reached for comment			0
@entity6 spokeswoman @entity124 welcomed the decision , saying it serves ' to protect the opinions of consumers online			0
