by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 is far from choosing his first choice goalkeeper at @entity3 – despite a stunning save from @entity4 on his debut			1
the returning @entity8 ‘ keeper and established no 1 @entity7 are competing to be @entity1 ’s first choice at @entity10 this season and each played 45 minutes in @entity3 ’s 3 - 0 pre-season defeat at @entity14			1
but @entity1 spoke afterwards about the situation , praising the man he says is the best young goalkeeper in the world but also flagging up how quiet @entity4 was on his first outing with his new team - mates			2
he needs to play , we do n’t have lots of time until the beginning of the season – there ’s two more weeks so we need to give him more playing time			0
‘ @entity7 ( @entity7 ) is the same so the decision was 45 - 45 here and the next match in @entity39 will be exactly the same thing			0
‘ he ( @entity4 ) had a fabulous save from the ( @entity43 ) @entity42 header , after that in the other two goals he has no chance and he was quiet - but the save was fantastic			0
’ big call : @entity1 has the hard challenge of choosing between the two goalkeepers @entity3 need games - @entity1			2

@entity3 *duo* @entity4 and @entity7 played 45 minutes apiece
the @entity55 lost 3 - 0 against @entity56 outfit @entity14 in *friendly*
@entity1 *believes* @entity4 is the best young goalkeeper in the world
