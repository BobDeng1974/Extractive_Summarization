this is a county season full of opportunity , with domestic performances counting towards @entity5 selection more than at any time in years , but certainly @entity6 has more to play for than most			1
@entity6 is the man @entity5 are desperate to include in all forms of the game , so much so that they dangled a particularly juicy carrot in front of him by suggesting that a test comeback could be his if he withdrew from the @entity16			1
the early weeks of the season have seen others provide a more convincing case than @entity6 for what would seem to be one test middle - order vacancy at @entity22 — notably @entity23			1
but the @entity24 is very much in contention to face @entity26 next month even if he does not score a shedload of runs			2
knocking on the door : @entity6 has remained an integral part of @entity5 's one - day set - up in good nick : @entity33 's @entity23 is the incumbent no 5 test batsman for @entity5 it is not just @entity6 ’s ability to provide the flair @entity5 will be missing post @entity39 , it is also his temperament and leadership ability that make him so important			1
one of the reasons @entity44 has not come under more pressure as captain is the dearth of alternatives			0
@entity49 has one of the best cricket brains in the side but , as he intimated this week , he may have to give up the @entity52 as he prioritises @entity53 and one - day cricket			2
as a fast bowler grappling with modern schedules , he could not contemplate any extra responsibility			0
with @entity59 never really dispelling the feeling that he is more follower than leader and @entity62 not ready , that leaves @entity6 as the only viable alternative to @entity44			2
no pressure : @entity44 has something of a leadership vacuum beneath him @entity6 ’s 16 - match @entity53 career has hardly been a disaster , as two centuries would testify , and he has eradicated the glitch that saw him crouching excessively at the crease during his last , ill - fated series against @entity73			2
he has always argued that test cricket is his priority but it has not looked that way when he has seemed happier to sit on the benches of @entity16 clubs than try to prove himself in first - class cricket			0
‘ the last two years opportunities have n’t been there , ’ argued @entity6 , 27			0
‘ one - day cricket has been my strength			0
i was a late starter in red - ball cricket			0
i am still learning and trying to improve , but i do n’t think a lesser stint in the @entity16 or an extra couple of @entity88 in @entity5 would have helped me get back in the test side before now			1
found out : @entity6 's last @entity53 outing came against @entity73 in february 2012 ‘ now , i think , everybody sees a big chance			1
having played a bit in the past and enjoyed my time in the test team , i would like to be back on board			0
’ @entity6 , who will captain @entity98 ’s one - day side this year , travels to @entity101 for friday ’s first international of the season knowing that by the end of the summer he could have cemented himself in test cricket again			1
and given @entity5 another leadership option			2
@entity108 's @entity107 caught @entity108 's eye this week : the good the new broom has swept clean and here we go @entity112			1
it ’s great to see so many young players coming to the fore in @entity117 cricket — @entity118 is all the rage and has a chance of playing test cricket soon , while plenty more are putting themselves in the shop window			0
knocking on the door : @entity125 - born @entity118 is expected to open with @entity44 i ’ve been up at @entity127 this week where , among eye - catching performances from @entity129 and @entity130 , i ’ve been very impressed by another likely lad in @entity127 opener @entity132			1
opportunity knocks ! the bad so good has this game between @entity127 and @entity33 been that i ca n’t understand why @entity62 and @entity23 have been kicking their heels at a @entity140 training camp rather than getting miles in their legs here			0
@entity5 ’s argument is that their players have needed white - ball practice before playing @entity147 on friday but white , red , pink or green it ’s still a ball			2
they should have been playing in a game at this stage of the season			0
@entity153 wool : @entity5 's @entity62 was withdrawn from county action this week @entity156 ’s final word interesting though it will be to visit the @entity101 ground where sir @entity160 scored his last century on @entity162 soil when @entity5 play @entity147 on friday , it does seem extraordinary that @entity163 will host the first international of the domestic season			1
cricket schedules are increasingly barmy but @entity101 on may 9 ? the forecast is for cold and wet weather — who would have thought it for spring in northern @entity147 ?			0

@entity6 could return to @entity5 's test side this summer
@entity6 last played in @entity5 white in february 2012
@entity24 - born batsman would help share burden of leadership
