when major @entity1 retraced the steps of @entity5 prisoners of war and their infamous ' death march ' from 1945 , he thought his photographs would bare only a vague resemblance to the tortuous route pows took 70 years ago			2
the retired army officer had revisited the muddy track in @entity13 where thousands of @entity14 trudged to their deaths , only to be given a shocking surprise when he looked back at his images			1
maj @entity19 studied his pictures and found what appeared to be hunched , skeletal ghostly figures marching across his photograph , almost exactly in line with the path they took seven decades ago			2
apparition : has @entity2 captured the spirits of long dead pows on a notorious death march 67 years ago ? the haunting image evokes strong memories of the desperate ' death march ' made by @entity5 prisoners of war			2
some 2,400 @entity36 died in the horrific @entity37 in 1945 to avoid them being liberated as @entity38 was forced on the retreat			1
severely malnourished and barefoot , they were forced by brutal @entity38 captors to walk 160 miles in sweltering heat for a month			1
maj @entity19 took the picture from the window of a 4x4 vehicle while driving along the ' death march ' route in 2010			2
it is thought the astonishing photographic illusion was caused by a the reflection of a patterned towel which was on the dashboard of the vehicle as he took the image			0
surrendered : 67,000 @entity56 also forced into notorious @entity57 in the @entity58 , april 1942 maj @entity19 said he took the picture in 2010 when he did a recce of the route ahead of @entity63 and the unveiling of a memorial to the 400 members of the @entity67 who died			2
men who collapsed through exhaustion were left to die or were killed by being shot , bayoneted or beheaded			1
only six men survived the three marches from @entity72 to @entity73 and that was because they managed to escape			1
it was the single greatest atrocity against @entity77 troops			1
@entity78 : exhausted pows get respite along the @entity57 watched by merciless @entity38 guards cruelty : over 11,000 @entity5 prisoners died or were killed on the way by guards maj @entity19 , 66 , said : ' we were driving along the same track as that taken by the death march and i was clicking away on my camera , i took about 200 - odd digital photographs			1
' i went through the pictures on a computer screen later and did nâ€™t see it the first time round			0
i went back over them again and i just suddenly thought " what the hell ... ? " ' i looked at the photo again and went very cold indeed			0
what i saw were the shapes of 17 or 18 ghostly figures coming out of the jungle and walking down the track going to @entity73 which you can see in the far distance			1
' it took me a few moments to work out how it had occurred but it was too weird for words			0
i showed it to several people and they said it is quite extraordinary , some even refused to look at it because it was so haunting			0
' while my guide drove along he put a towel on the dashboard			0
the towel had a pattern on it and that reflected through the windscreen			0
i have called it reflections of a death march			0
' maj @entity19 is now an instructor in jungle warfare for the @entity67			2
at @entity130 : @entity38 troops guard @entity133 and @entity58 prisoners in @entity134 in the @entity58 after their capture on 9th april 1942			1
forced ' death marches ' of captured soldiers , interned civilians or persecuted ethnic groups were a common sight during the @entity141			0
the brutal demonstrations , in which hundreds of thousands died from exhaustion , disease or beatings from their captors in @entity148 or the @entity149 , took place to stop prisoners being liberated			1
one of the most high - profile marches saw an estimated 80,000 @entity153 forced to march across @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity148 in harsh winter conditions in early 1945			0
but as the tide of war began to turn in the same year , @entity158 's forces began to evacuate captured pows and other prisoners westwards			2
during the marches , @entity56 were divided into groups of up to 300 men and marched off under guard			1
but lack of supplies meant they had to scavenge for food and shelter and the weak were left behind to die			0
others were murdered by some of their guards			0
official figures said 3,500 @entity133 and @entity176 and @entity177 men lost their lives but others estimate around 8,348 died			1
but the most notorious death marches were the @entity182 - led evacuation of concentration camps			0
those too weak were killed outright and the rest were mercilessly driven on to other camps suffering beatings and mass murder			2
for example nine days before the liberation of @entity191 60,000 inmates were taken on a 35 mile death march to waiting trains , 15,000 died on the way			1
in the @entity196 the @entity149 was also responsible for carrying out numerous death marches			0
one of the most notorious was the @entity57 of 60,000 @entity58 and 15,000 @entity198 after a three month battle in 1942			0
they were forced on a 128km march in which over 11,000 were beaten , bayoneted , mistreated and died from heat and exhaustion .			1

images of ghostly skeletons on @entity13 jungle track caught on film
2,400 @entity77 and @entity176 pows marched 160 mile by @entity38 , but only six survived
men died of exhaustion , *starvation* , beatings or bayoneted
