@entity1 manager @entity0 took much encouragement from last season 's derby dominance - and intends to send his team out seeking exactly the same this weekend			1
city head into sunday 's much - hyped clash with @entity8 at the @entity9 short of form but with @entity0 vowing to stick to his default , attack - based philosophy			1
questions are being asked of the champions ' durability after a run of three games without a win but @entity0 brushed off similar doubts a year ago , with a 4 - 1 thrashing of @entity8 at home sending out clear signals			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 has watched his side really struggle in recent weeks @entity24 celebrates scoring for @entity1 as they thumped @entity8 at the @entity26 last season @entity27 was on song as @entity8 were beaten 3 - 0 by @entity1 towards the end of last season @entity0 , whose side also beat @entity8 3 - 0 on their way to winning the @entity33 , said : ' i always say i am not the kind of manager that thinks when you win ( it is ) because you did ( one ) single thing			1
' i think it is very important to play in one way and have absolute trust in your players , and i think always the players make the difference			1
' the ( derby ) game we played here was in a moment when i was new here , when maybe there were a lot of doubts about the results that we were taking , especially away			0
' but i did n't change in my mind the way we had to play against every team			2
i talked with my players and told them to play in the way we did every game , working in training sessions			0
' i think that was an important moment and we really played very well			0
' the passions evoked by the derby could be what @entity1 need to help rediscover their spark after a difficult past 10 days			2
@entity72 knocked @entity1 out of the @entity73 after goals from @entity75 and @entity76 ( above ) @entity0 ( above ) watched his side lose 2 - 1 to @entity78 in the last @entity33 game @entity80 rises highest to head home the second goal for @entity78 to put them 2 - 0 up against @entity1 @entity1 keeper @entity83 lies helpless in the net as @entity80 runs off in celebration after his goal @entity1 surrendered a two - goal lead to draw at @entity88 in their faltering @entity90 campaign and then lost at @entity78 last week			1
to compound matters , they were then dumped out of the @entity73 by under - strength @entity72 on wednesday			0
but @entity0 , who faces a critical few days with @entity88 visiting @entity9 next wednesday , does not want to place too much emphasis on this particular fixture			0
the @entity96 said : ' it does n't depend on what we do the game before the derby			0
it is important for us to play against @entity8 or @entity103 next week , or @entity88 , in the same way we normally do			2
that is the most important thing			0
' while @entity0 may hope the outcome might be the same as last year , the @entity8 side they are facing has changed			1
@entity0 played down the importance of the managers as he prepares to face @entity111 @entity111 has replaced @entity112 as manager and upwards of Â£ 150million has been spent on new players to reinvigorate the team			2
@entity0 , just a week after being nominated for coach of the year , could find himself coming under scrutiny if his team 's poor sequence continues			2
but the 61 - year - old wants the attention in the derby to be on the action , not the managers			0
he said : ' i think on sunday we play @entity1 against @entity8 and last year was exactly the same			1
' it was not me against @entity112 and sunday will not be me against @entity111			0
it is a game for both teams and that is the important thing			0
' @entity133 playmaker @entity132 will miss the derby after coming off injured against @entity72 @entity0 said that @entity24 will be a very important player for @entity1 in sunday 's derby city are without in - form playmaker @entity132 , who has been ruled out for three weeks with a knee injury			1
but one on - song player still available is @entity24 , who struck four against @entity140 in @entity1 's last home win			1
@entity0 said : ' i think @entity24 will always be a very important player for us			2
' he only played some minutes ( 20 ) against @entity72 because he played three games in a row of 90 minutes - but i think he is improving every game and he will always make the difference			0

@entity1 welcome *rivals* @entity8 to the @entity26 on sunday
@entity0 's side have failed to win in their last three *matches*
the @entity1 boss *insists* his team will not change their attacking approach
the @entity96 says it is important to have ' absolute trust ' in his players
@entity1 beat @entity8 4 - 1 and 3 - 0 in the @entity33 last season
