by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a @entity4 mother whose baby died after being left in a hot car has been cleared of her manslaughter , after evidence given during her trial said she was suffering from ' forgotten baby syndrome '			1
five - month - old @entity11 died from heatstroke when locked in the car on a 30c day after her mother , @entity14 , forgot her after a family trip to a @entity17 takeaway shop on december 11 , 2012			1
ms @entity11 , 29 , was found not guilty in the @entity18 on thursday			1
during her trial , expert witness professor @entity19 , a neuroscientist and memory expert from the @entity22 , claimed she was suffering from forgotten baby syndrome			1
on thursday it was found ms @entity11 's forgetfulness did not amount to criminal negligence			1
her defence barrister @entity42 said she was not a child killer but a well - intentioned mother who had made a mistake			0
defence lawyer @entity42 said ms @entity11 now wanted to be left to grieve her loss			1
' there are no winners in a case like this , ' he told reporters outside the court in @entity17			1
' despite a legal win for @entity14 today , the fact is she has to live with these consequences for the rest of her life			2
' ms @entity11 put @entity11 in a baby seat , facing backwards , for the short car ride to hungry jacks to pick up a meal for her six - year - old son ms @entity11 forgot @entity11 was in the car when she locked the door and went inside her house on a 30c day but what is ' forgotten baby syndrome ' ? prof @entity19 , who gave evidence in ms @entity11 's trial , says it is ' our attempt to try to understand how it is that normal attentive and loving parents forget that their children are in the car with them			1
' ' so they arrive at their destination and they 've completely lost awareness that their child is in the car so they exit the car leaving the child in it , ' he told @entity87 on friday			2
professor @entity19 , a neuroscientist and memory expert from the @entity22 ' the car heats up and then the child dies of heatstroke			2
' prof @entity19 said there had been hundreds of cases of forgotten child syndrome documented worldwide			2
' the constant factor , the common thread to all these forgotten children is that the parent is involved in some sort of habitual drive that typically does not include the child , ' he said			2
@entity103 , a memory expert from the @entity105 , said that it was ' not totally beyond the realm of plausibility ' that a parent could forget their child is in a car with them , but he said it was ' drawing a long bow ' to call it a syndrome			2
' i think there 's a tendency to call everything a syndrome , ' prof @entity103 told @entity120			0
' it has that implication that there is some kind of biological defect or cause to it			0
' prof @entity103 said memory is fallible			0
' there are lots of factors that will lead people to forget things even the most important things in our lives like children in back seats , ' he said			0
but prof @entity103 added that the term ' forgotten baby syndrome ' makes the incident of a parent forgetting a child in a car sound like it is the result of a mental defect			1
' you could imagine that 's partly why people are construing it that way , in order to deflect criminal charges , ' he said			0
' it 's a typical ploy that everyone will play some sort of a card that they 're suffering from some sort of mental defect			0
during ms @entity11 's trial , expert witness professor @entity19 claimed she was suffering from forgotten baby syndrome ' you can always get diverse medical opinion as to what 's going on			1
' prof @entity103 said he believed the term ' forgotten baby syndrome ' would only make sense if it was secondary to another problem , such as depression			1
' in depression one of the things is that memory suffers , you become preoccupied with your own thoughts , which leads to forgetting things			0
' before @entity14 's manslaughter trial , she made a formal application for charges against her to be dropped			1
she tearfully pleaded she had no memory of placing five - month - old @entity11 in the back seat , and thought originally her daughter had been kidnapped			1
ms @entity11 , an a-grade netball coach , was a single mother before the december day in 2012 when she strapped her five - month - old @entity179 into a car seat and forgot her in 30 - plus degree temperatures			1
the tragedy unfolded on the evening of december 11 , 2012 in @entity17 , where the average temperature during the three hours @entity11 was strapped in the car topped 30 degrees celsius			1
ms @entity11 had left home in the late afternoon to fetch a @entity188 meal			1
normally , she would have left @entity179 at home with her mother but @entity11 was grouchy and so ms @entity11 put her in the baby seat , facing backwards , for the short car ride			1
they arrived home at 4.45pm			0
ms @entity11 locked the car with the remote control and carried the drinks into the house			1
ms @entity11 would later say in a police interview she believed she had put @entity179 down to sleep in a cot			2
ms @entity11 took a cup of tea outside and lit a cigarette to smoke while she telephoned her friend			2
it was after 6.30pm , and still hot			0
the two friends chatted about @entity209 shopping			0
the conversation lasted 19 minutes and 44 seconds			0
ms @entity11 then went to check on @entity11 in her cot in a front room of the house			2
neither @entity11 nor her bottle was in the cot			2
ms @entity11 rang her sister in a panic and told her : ' i put her down for a sleep and she 's not there			2
' ms @entity11 hung up and rang the @entity17 police to report a child abduction			1
the police arrived within ten minutes and started searching the house			0
ms @entity11 's brother was the first of several family members to turn up amid flashing blue lights , sirens and confusion among the neighbours who gathered outside the crime scene tape on the street			0
an officer asked ms @entity11 to open her car which was parked not 200 metres from the house			1
they made the terrible discovery - bella in her car seat , not moving			0
ms @entity11 broke down , crying and screaming			0
the baby was taken to hospital where medical staff tried to revive her			0
dr @entity245 later told police he believed the child had been dead for some time before reaching hospital			0
he observed ' bluish purple discolouration ' on @entity11 's back and buttocks , which indicated the child was ' really dead '			0
a post mortem on @entity11 discovered traces of morphine			0
forensic examiners questioned whether paramedics administered the drug instead of adrenaline			0
ms @entity11 's relatives told police she was a ' loving mum ' and her children were ' always dressed well and clean and happy '			1
her mother denied she was forgetful , saying she was ' really switched on ' and would ' never do anything to hurt her kids '			0
over the ensuing year , as the @entity11 family tried to come to terms with the little girl 's death , the @entity265 mounted a case against @entity14			1
she was found not guilty of manslaughter in the @entity18 on thursday july 24 .			0
