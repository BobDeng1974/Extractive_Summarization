by @entity0 paint giant @entity1 has been forced to pay out thousands of pounds in compensation to disgruntled diy - ers who claimed its ‘ brilliant white ’ paint is neither brilliant nor white - because it fades to yellow			1
customers complained the company ’s oil - based paint turns a creamy yellow colour over time - often within weeks of application			1
@entity1 has admitted the problem was caused by new @entity14 regulations which forced it to water down solvent levels in the paint			1
@entity18 , 35 , with the doors she painted white ... but have since turned yellow but customers left with yellow walls are furious they were n't warned about of the problem before they invested hours painting their homes			1
@entity18 , 35 , ( pictured ) and her husband @entity24 , 36 , have spent hours repainting their home in @entity26 , @entity27 , after the @entity1 paint faded to yellow			1
the couple painted all the doors and skirting in the hallway , landing , bathrooms and bedrooms in @entity1 white satinwood after moving in			1
mum - of - two @entity18 , a freelance writer , said : ' we recently had the skirting replaced in the hallway and when we put fresh white paint on there it showed up just how yellow the old paint was			2
' so we ’ve had to repaint everything and it ’s going to take ages because there are so many doors to do			2
@entity1 admitted new @entity14 regulations have affected the ' white - ness ' of its brilliant white paint ' it ’s very annoying because you expect white paint to stay white for longer than a few years			1
especially when you pay extra for a leading brand name like @entity1			1
' @entity55 , 58 , was offered £ 500 in compensation after 11 doors of his home and the flat he rents went yellow just weeks after he applied the paint			1
but the general manager at a car salvage yard , from @entity63 , @entity64 , is now taking the company to the @entity66 - insisting it will cost £ 2,000 to re-paint			2
he said : ' i feel like i have been cheated - i was devastated when they told me what was wrong with the paint			2
' it is obviously something they must have known about			2
i first started to notice it was discolouring after a matter of just weeks			2
' i eventually came to the realisation that something was not quite right - at first i thought i had done something wrong - it looked horrendous			0
' to my surprise @entity1 actually put their hand up straight away and said ‘ yes we have a problem with this paint - it is a problem that we know about ’			1
it pulls into question why they managed to sell it to me in the first place			0
they have offered me £ 500 in compensation but i have estimated it will cost £ 2,120 to re-paint			2
the problem emerged in 2010 after the @entity14 forced all companies to reduce the amount of @entity94 ( @entity95 ) in their oil - based paints			1
firms , including @entity1 , were forced to reformulate their paints , but that led to its ‘ brilliant white ’ substance losing its colour			1
@entity105 , an expert decoration consultant , explained : ' to get rid of or reduce the amount of @entity95 , you had to reduce the solvent			0
@entity18 repaints her faded doors with a fresh coat of white paint ' if you reduce the solvent you have to increase something else			0
so what they would have to do to keep it in liquid form would be to increase the drying oil			0
' to increase the drying oil unfortunately causes more rapid yellowing of the paint			0
' @entity1 included the @entity95 label on its tins - informing customers of the change - but fail to warn customers of the yellowing problem			1
it even boasted that its paint was ‘ long - lasting ’			0
in contrast , rival @entity129 put on some of its tins : ' recent changes made to meet the reduced solvent levels ... may lead to yellowing over time			0
' @entity134 , who was given vouchers for new paint and £ 250 by @entity1 after doors and frames in his home turned yellow , added : ' it was if we had chosen a different colour			1
' it was a real shock			0
also we were worried about having to do the work again			0
it was just totally unacceptable			0
' @entity1 claims it has now solved the problem that had affected a ' small minority ' of customers			1
@entity147 , a @entity148 director of @entity1 , speaking on @entity150 ’s watchdog programme which highlighted the issue , said : ' this is a problem that affected the whole industry			1
' we reformulated our products as did everyone else			0
we started to see a problem in the market in 2010 for a small minority of customers under certain conditions			2
' as soon as we saw that we put all our energies into solving the problem , which we did in 2011			0
' we focused our efforts on actually solving the problem rather than making a disclaimer against it			0
' all the products we have produced since 2011 - and is in the shops on sale today - is as good as it was pre- 2010			0
' for those individuals who have had a problem and have complained to us - we ’ve resolved 95 per cent of all those complaints in a fair and reasonable way			0
' people can have confidence in what we are doing			0

@entity1 admits it *'s* aware of the fault but blames tough new @entity14 rules
customers *unhappy* with compensation offers , demand more money back
