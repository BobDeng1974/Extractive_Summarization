before @entity4 , 5 , gave birth there were just seven @entity16 living here			1
and strict breeding rules mean another litter will not be born in @entity8 until at least 2015			1

she is doing quite well now			0

‘ it marks a real milestone in our quest to establish a healthy and diverse population of this amazing breed in the @entity8			2
