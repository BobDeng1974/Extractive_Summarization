as the flame of a large , household candle approaches my hair , i fight back the very natural instinct to panic and yank my head away			1
everyone knows what happens when naked flames and hair meet : it rarely ends well			1
i still wince when i recall seeing my daughter ’s hair catch light during a candlelit carol service years ago			1
her long hair swung forward into the candle she was holding and went up like a torch			1
thankfully , only an inch or two burned before the flame fizzled out , but it gave us all a shock			0
he is the man with the candle — and he is about to set fire to a twisted flank of my hair			1
it may sound insane , but what he is doing is an age - old @entity24 hair - smoothing technique called velaterapia , which gets rid of split ends — and @entity48 is the latest treatment on offer at this swish super-salon			1
@entity35 is famous for tending the tresses of the @entity54 sisters , so i feel i am in safe hands			0
he would n’t offer a treatment that would turn a royal into a real - life @entity58 , would he ? ‘ it sounds crazy , ’ says @entity34 , ‘ but it works , 100 per cent			2
it ’s the best way to get rid of split ends			1
if we try to cut split ends out , it is impossible — it takes for ever			1
but by burning them , you catch all of them			2
’ split ends , where the ends of the hair shaft split in two , are inconvenient for anyone trying to grow their hair			1
as hair gets older , it becomes more likely to split , as the protective cuticle around each strand becomes worn			2
split ends are n’t a problem , as such , but they make hair look frizzy and rough			1
although conditioner can smooth these cuticles down so they are less obvious , nothing will actually mend a split end			2
usually , the only answer is to cut them off			0
championed by @entity90 supermodels @entity91 and @entity92 , velaterapia — better known as ‘ candle cutting ’ — instead uses a flame to singe away split ends and effectively cauterize the hair , creating a sturdy seal that makes it less prone to split again			1
how it works is simple			0
@entity34 , who learned the technique from a @entity24 stylist , takes a section of my hair and twizzles it into a tight twist about as thick as a pencil			1
he pulls it taut and away from my head , and i can see the tiny ends of shorter hairs sticking out			2
then , he takes the candle and lets the flame lick up and down the twist of hair			2
the tiny , sticking - out ends flare up , making me wince in alarm			2
but just as i ’m about to panic that my crowning glory is going up in smoke , the burning ends fizzle out			2
the unpleasant smell of singed hair gets stronger as @entity34 works around my head , tiny section by tiny section			2
it looks as though the flame is licking over his fingers , too , though he says it does n’t hurt			0
‘ the hair does n’t catch fire as it is twisted so tightly , ’ he says			1
‘ only the bits that stick out get singed			0
it melts the ends together and seals them , so it ’s a clever way of getting rid of split ends all the way down the hair			1
that ’s why it ’s great for keeping long hair smooth — if you have a trim , you only catch the split ends at the very bottom			1
’ i last had my hair cut three months ago , so there are likely a fair number of split ends			1
i think a lot of what is going up in flames is just hair that has n’t grown the full length of the twist			0
it does n’t stand a chance			0
the technique is becoming hugely popular			0
word is spreading fast , and it ’s catching on ( sorry ) like wildfire			0
@entity34 already treats ten heads a week — at £ 195 a go — and he ’s now training other hairdressers in the art of the candle			0
for good measure , @entity164 waves the candle under the tuft at the end of each twist			0
i fear all these burnt bits will be left rough and bobbly — but when i feel them , there is no roughness			0
the whole thing has taken just half - an - hour			0
once my hair has been washed to get rid of the candle smuts , it is indulged with a ten - minute intense conditioning treatment , then blow - dried			1
it has rarely felt so smooth			0
i ’m delighted and impressed			0
but i must say , do n’t try this at home ! from £ 195 , richardward.com			0
includes a cleanse , condition , trim ( if needed ) and blow - dry .			0
