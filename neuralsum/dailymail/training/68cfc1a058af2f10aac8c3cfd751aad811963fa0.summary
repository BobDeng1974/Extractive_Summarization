the sobering reality of life in a city that was decimated by an earthquake that killed 185 people exactly four years ago has given @entity5 valuable perspective as they attempt to put their @entity7 back on track against @entity9			1
@entity10 is still in recovery , with signs of devastation still evident throughout a city centre that is barely recognisable to those members of the @entity5 party who were last here seven years ago			1
@entity17 has fond memories of his time here and hopes the staging of three @entity7 matches at the picturesque @entity23 , culminating in @entity5 's must win game against the @entity25 , can help the recovery process			1
@entity17 has fond memories of his time in @entity10 and will be hoping @entity5 can beat @entity9 @entity17 talks to the media during an @entity5 press conference at the picturesque @entity23 on sunday @entity5 must win their game against @entity9 and @entity17 will be keen to make progress at the @entity7 ' we were given a really interesting talk on what happened here and it puts a lot of things in perspective after the way we played against @entity40 , ' said @entity17			1
' having remembered @entity10 as a busy , sporting city it 's amazing to come back to this			2
' we started the tour here in 2008 and i remember being 12th man at the old rugby ground			2
to see some of the slides and pictures of what it looks like now was moving			2
' to be here again and to see how they have been able to put sport back on is really nice			2
it was incredible to hear about it			0
the way everyone has got together moving forward and the role sport has played is something we can learn from			0
' it was a welcome reminder on what really matters to a team who will be under enormous sporting pressure when they take on supposedly the weakest team in their group in a match that has taken on huge significance for @entity5			1
@entity17 not only wants to beat the @entity25 on monday but beat them well to banish the memories of the total capitulation against @entity75 and @entity40			1
' it 's about how we react now and we have to put in a good performance , ' said @entity5 's senior batsman			1
' the result is obviously the most important thing but it would be nice to win with real clinical cricket			2
we have n't produced anything like that in the opening two games			0
we 've been well off the pace			0
@entity5 head coach @entity89 is feeling the pressure ahead of their must win game against @entity9 @entity89 and @entity93 have a discussion during an @entity5 's nets session at the @entity96 @entity5 have lost their opening two games of the @entity7 and can not afford to lose on sunday ' it would be nice to turn up here and put together the game we know we can			1
that 's what we have to do			0
even though what 's happened up to now has been really bad it 's irrelevant now			0
we have to turn up and play our best cricket			0
' that means the senior players standing up as they did last summer when @entity5 were under pressure after losing the @entity110 against @entity111			1
' it 's important for the guys who have been through bad times and come through to speak to the group and make sure they are calm and ready for tomorrow			0
the senior guys have had a part to play in the last 48 hours			0
' certainly as far as i 'm concerned if i can get us off to a good start with @entity122 that will help us in putting in a good performance			0
' the fact we have to apologise about our cricket is unacceptable			0
it 's really disappointing what we 've done but hopefully in the next four games we can put it right and start playing the cricket everyone knows we can			0
' @entity131 ( right ) top scored for @entity5 with 46 before being caught out by @entity132 @entity133 of @entity5 heads back to the dressing room after losing his wicket to @entity136 @entity137 leads his team off the field after their @entity7 defeat against @entity40 @entity141 ( left ) , @entity142 and @entity137 talk tactics during their heavy loss to the hosts @entity5 were on sunday considering making two changes to their embattled line up , bringing in @entity148 for @entity149 and @entity150 for @entity93			1
@entity148 has been out of favour since @entity111 exposed a technical issue last year but may get the chance ahead of a batsman in @entity155 who has looked badly out of touch since being brought in for @entity157 on the eve of the tournament			0
@entity161 , the @entity5 batting coach , has been impressed with the maturity , a problem in the past , @entity148 has shown here and says that he has been ' knocking hard ' on the door			1
@entity5 may now open it and let him in			1
@entity93 was smashed for 49 off just two overs by @entity167 in @entity168 and may now be taken out of the firing line in favour of the senior spinner in @entity150 who has struggled for opportunities since @entity174 's off - spin became a regular part of the @entity5 attack .			2

@entity5 lost their first two @entity178 matches
they lost *spectacularly* against @entity75 and @entity40
@entity5 have a must win game against @entity9 next
