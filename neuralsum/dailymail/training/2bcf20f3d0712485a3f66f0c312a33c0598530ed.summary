a nine - year - old girl has been left traumatised after her classmates ripped up @entity3 cards she gave to them because they did n't come with candy canes			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 on the @entity7 , bought cards for her daughter @entity8 to give out to children at school but could n't find mini candy canes at the shop			1
ms @entity5 said the @entity14 student has been left extremely upset after the cards were thrown out right in front of her			2
' she said " mum some of the people today just threw them out " , they ripped them up in front of her , ' she told @entity20			2
@entity5 ( left ) is devastated for her daughter @entity8 ( right ) who was treated so cruelly by her classmates when she gave them @entity3 cards - but did not include candy canes in the envelope ' it 's just so rude , she 's a fairly private person anyway and it 's like a slap in the face			1
' she 's does n't like showing her feelings so outright , that 's why when she came home and told me about it she said " mum i 'm not doing that again " , she does n't want to put herself out there			0
' ms @entity5 said she did n't think the children did it to intentionally bully her daughter			2
' i think it 's more to do with the expectation kids seem to have these days , they 've kind of got this attitude of what to get out of things rather than what they can give , ' she said			0
' you ca n't say that for all kids but i just question whether or not it 's a sign of the times or is the way we 're parenting ? ms @entity5 said she did n't think the children did it to intentionally bully her daughter , but instead thought they lacked manners and expected too much ' are we not showing kids to be grateful ? ' ms @entity5 said she is treating the whole ordeal as a learning experience for @entity8 and her younger daughter @entity60 , seven			1
' my biggest thing , i want them to be kind and i want them to be responsible for their actions , ' she said			0
' i want them to have the old fashion manners and respect and i think it starts in the home			0
' since ms @entity5 posted about her daughter on a community facebook page the family has been inundated with messages of support and people wanting to send @entity3 cards to @entity8			1
' it just brought me to tears , i 've gone through and read all of the messages to my daughters , ' she said			0
' i think that 's really encouraged @entity8 , i want to show her this is what people are really like			0
