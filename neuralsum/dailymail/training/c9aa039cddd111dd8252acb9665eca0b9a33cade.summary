foreign patients will have to prove they are entitled to free @entity2 care in a clampdown on health tourism			2
in order to register with a gp , @entity6 nationals will be required to show their @entity9			1
the @entity10 has , until now , been far less efficient than other countries in reclaiming the money owed for treating foreign citizens			1
as a result , the @entity2 is losing an estimated £ 400million a year simply because it is failing to identify @entity6 patients and claw back the cost of their treatment from their governments			1
the move could eventually be extended to cover patients from other parts of the world in a bid to save the @entity2 an estimated £ 2billion a year			2
receptionists will for the first time ask all new patients from @entity24 countries to show their @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , otherwise they will be barred from registering			1
this will allow the @entity2 to flag up patients whose home countries should be paying for their treatment , particularly if they go on to be seen in hospital			1
under an @entity6 agreement , citizens can be treated free of charge in other countries as long as their government repays the cost			1
but the @entity10 claws back only £ 1 for every £ 15 we pay for @entity10 to be treated abroad			1
last year the government managed to collect £ 50million from @entity6 countries but paid out £ 750million			1
a pilot scheme due to begin later this year is the first stage of an ambitious plan to recoup the cost of treating overseas patients			2
the @entity58 is asking for ten practices to sign up			0
receptionists will ask all new patients from the @entity6 – including @entity10 citizens – to present their @entity9 card when registering with surgery			1
many @entity10 patients have these cards but if they do not they should be able to use their passport or other form of identity as proof they are entitled to @entity2 care			2
patients from other @entity6 countries will be recorded on a computer system so that @entity2 officials can compile a bill for the costs of their gp appointment and any further treatment			1
currently , certain @entity2 services – including gp appointments , @entity82 , maternity and any treatment deemed urgent or life - threatening – are free for everyone			2
but overseas patients – which include anyone who has lived here for less than 12 months – are meant to pay for all other hospital treatment , such as x-rays , consultations and operations			2
in reality , however , staff rarely recover these costs at present			0
@entity96 are being used to identify those from whom cash can be reclaimed because they are the gateway to the @entity2 for most patients			0
some senior gps criticised the move , suggesting it would turn them into debt collectors and may prevent seriously ill foreign patients from seeking help			0
dr @entity107 , deputy chair of the @entity108 and a retired gp in @entity110 , said : ‘ the health secretary would be wise to concentrate on the major pressures on the @entity2			0
‘ if this plan comes to fruition it will at best reduce the role of doctors to debt collectors			0
at worst it will deter them from registering migrants and asylum seekers as well as setting up a new system of charging that could be extended			0
’ waste : the @entity2 is losing an estimated £ 400million a year simply because it is failing to identify @entity6 patients and claw back the cost of their treatment from their governments			1
above , file image but dr @entity127 , a member of the @entity108 ’s gp committee who has been working on the plans with the @entity58 , said they were designed to get staff used to asking for cards routinely			0
he added : ‘ we need to pilot it and see how much work it is			0
it will be extra administrative work potentially but it will hopefully clarify who is and who is n’t entitled to @entity2 care and clearly there is a huge amount of money being spent in the @entity2 on people who are not entitled to it			0
what we have been absolutely clear about is that this is n’t about the @entity96 becoming a police force			0
’ the government is consulting on other plans which include making overseas patients pay 150 per cent of the cost of treatment , which would make it profitable for hospitals to chase the bills			1
ministers are also consulting on proposals to introduce a £ 200 annual health levy for migrants who are here longer than six months			0
the @entity58 said : ‘ we are absolutely committed to improving the way the @entity2 recovers costs from international visitors			0

@entity6 nationals will need @entity9 to register with gp
will flag up patients whose home countries should pay for their treatment
citizens can be treated free of charge as long as governments repay cost
but @entity10 only collects £ 1 for every £ 15 paid for @entity10 to be treated abroad
