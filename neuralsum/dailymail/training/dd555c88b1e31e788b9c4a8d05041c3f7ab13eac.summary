@entity0 has criticised energy companies for their poor dealing of customer complaints @entity0 has written to energy companies demanding they take action on poor handling of customer complaints			1
the regulator 's chief executive has sent letters to the ' big six ' and smaller and independent suppliers about the ' industry - wide failure ' to handle complaints to an acceptable standard			1
it follows research by @entity0 that found more than half of those who had complained - 57 per cent of domestic customers and 52 per cent of small businesses - were not satisfied with how their supplier handled the problem			1
furthermore , in almost half of cases where the supplier considered the case resolved , the customer did not			2
@entity0 said satisfaction with @entity31 and @entity32 had fallen particularly markedly , from 36 per cent to 21 per cent and from 44 per cent to 20 per cent respectively , with only @entity34 managing to maintain levels of satisfaction found two years ago			1
earlier this year @entity0 opened an investigation into @entity31 's ' prolonged customer service failings ' , the first under its new standards of conduct which state that suppliers must treat consumers fairly			1
in today 's letter , @entity0 warned companies to improve the speed of resolving complaints , communicate better with customers during the process and be more proactive in finding a solution			1
the letter read : ' the results are unacceptable			0
i am therefore drawing attention publicly to these findings to leave you in no doubt about the need to act quickly to improve matters			0
' i expect you to provide a public response to the issues raised in this letter			0
' the regulator said many customers were now responding to suppliers ' poor service by switching , with almost one in two customers having either already switched or planning to do so as a result of their complaints experience			2
@entity0 chief executive @entity72 said : ' these satisfaction scores are frankly awful			1
@entity31 and @entity32 have seen satisfaction with their customer service fall markedly ' almost all energy suppliers need to improve their complaints handling as a matter of urgency			1
there are real business benefits to good complaints handling schemes , and it should n't need a regulator to tell companies about the importance of this			2
' suppliers must now tell their customers what steps they will be taking to put things right			0
we are already formally investigating @entity31 about complaints handling and other customer service issues , and this should send a strong signal to all suppliers that , where necessary , we will take action			2
' @entity0 said it was planning to bring forward the next survey of complainants to see whether the necessary improvements had happened and decide if more regulatory action was needed			1
which ? executive director @entity106 said : ' it should n't need involvement from @entity0 for energy companies to get the basics right			1
we found energy companies have hit rock bottom , with woeful service and dreadful complaints handling			1
' this situation has been going on for far too long and it 's little wonder that consumer trust is so low			2
suppliers need to respond with immediate improvements , not wait for the results of the competition and @entity125 's investigation			2
' @entity126 , chief executive of citizens advice , said : ' energy prices are up by a third since 2010 and people are now paying well over a thousand pounds a year to heat and light their homes			1
' energy is a basic essential for every household so firms need to do everything they can do get their service right and if something does go wrong , do their utmost to fix it straight away			0
' trust in the industry will be never be restored if suppliers ca n't get a grip on complaints handling			0
@entity0 should investigate firms where their handling of complaints , and the cause of them , could be breaking industry rules			2
' energy tariff prices are in a constant merry - go - round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other			0
shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on the cheapest deal			0
even moving every other year will save you significant amounts			0
if you are one of the millions of people who have never switched ( i.e. stuck with your original supplier ) , then you will definitely save a big chunk of cash , possibly as much as Â£ 300 a year			0
remember , suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you 're ready to switch , it will certainly pay to do so			0
do n't forget , prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live			0
you only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live , so do your own comparison to find the best price			0
