if you 've ever been in a stadium during a sporting event , you 'll know it can feel like the ground beneath your feet is moving when people celebrate a major moment			0
but scientists think this is literally happening at certain events - with particularly rowdy fans causing minor earthquakes			1
and this weekend they will perform the most accurate study yet , at an american football game , to see how big the earthquakes caused really are			1
the experiment will take place at an @entity28 game in @entity29 on sunday			1
they hope to get readings 10 times more reliable than before the scientists from the @entity18 and the @entity32 will perform the study at a game between the @entity35 and the @entity36 at 5:15pm local time on sunday 11 january			1
taking place at the @entity24 in downtown @entity29 , 67,000 fans are expected to be present and roaring their team to victory			1
using sensors strategically placed around the stadium , the researchers will then measure how the extent of their cheering and stamping			2
@entity18 scientists with the @entity32 installed three instruments in the stadium yesterday - two up in the stands and one by the playing field			1
seismologists have used such instruments at the stadium in the past , but this year 's experiment features faster connectivity and readings			2
a new tool called ' @entity60 ' is expected to display vibrations within three seconds , which is five to 10 times faster than the tool used with the sensors last year , the scientists said			1
if a big plays prompts a fan quake , viewers monitoring the @entity32 's webpage will see the activity before they see it on television , which has about a 10 - second delay during broadcast			1
' the @entity35 experiment should provide us and the internet - connected public with a feel for the minimum time early warning might provide , ' said dr @entity81 , a @entity18 professor emeritus of @entity82 and space sciences			1
the researchers will also use a website called @entity60 to gather data from fans			0
scientists first got interested in football when a seismometer a block away from the stadium showed vibrations during a ' legendary ' touchdown by @entity29 's @entity94 on 8 january 2011			1
this resulted in what is now called a ' @entity97 ' - when the energetic jumping and stomping of so many fans at once shook the stadium and reverberated through the surrounding soil			0
previous studies by the scientists have shown the quake produced can be a magnitude one or two			1
now they hope to gather data that is ten times more reliable than some they gathered last year			1
' we 're mostly interested in the speed and the reliability of the communications , ' said dr @entity114 , a @entity18 professor of @entity82 and space sciences and director of the seismic network			2
' it 's hard to simulate thousands of people using this tool all at once			0
when we can get a lot of people looking , we can see problems that we 'd encounter during an actual earthquake			0
' the researchers will use a website called @entity60 to gather data from fans from three sensors ( shown )			2
scientists first got interested in football when a seismometer a block away from the stadium showed vibrations during a ' legendary ' touchdown by @entity29 's @entity94 on 8 january 2011 the scientists will be hoping for some ' groundbreaking ' moments in the game this sunday to put their sensors to the test			1
pictured is @entity35 wide receiver @entity142 carrying the ball against the @entity144 in the second half of a game in december 2013 the foot - stomping is a real - world test of technology to detect the bigger shaking that originates underground			0
the seismic group is working with the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) to offer early warnings for the @entity32 that could provide tens of seconds to several minutes ' notice of an incoming strong shaking			2
this year some public agencies and large businesses will have a first chance to try out the system that will eventually be available to the public			0
' the @entity35 experiment should provide us and the internet - connected public with a feel for the minimum time early warning might provide , ' said dr @entity81 , a @entity18 professor emeritus of @entity82 & space sciences			1
' in this case it 's football fan activity that generates a signal as a warning for what shows up on tv some seconds later			0
in the future , it might be seconds to minutes of warning after an earthquake starts			0
' the scientists from the @entity18 and the @entity32 will perform the study at a game between the @entity35 and the @entity36 at 5:15pm local time on sunday 11 january at the @entity24 stadium ( shown ) in downtown @entity29 , with 67,000 fans expected as several pieces of seismic monitoring equipment sit on the floor , a scientist does a ' stomp test ' to check the gear at the @entity35 ' field , @entity24 yesterday			1
scientists with the @entity32 installed the instruments to record expected vibrations from jumping and stomping fans this weekend the group will be beefing up its social - media presence to post updates and respond to questions during the game			1
that also helps get ready for an emergency situation			0
' during the rumblings on @entity207 a decade ago there was a huge influx of web visits and phone calls , ' dr @entity81 said			0
' now with social media , it 's a whole new ballgame			0
we 've got to learn how to deal with that because it 's going to snow us over if we 're not prepared			0
' the group will have more staff monitoring social media during the game , and more robust websites that they hope wo n't slow down or crash during heavy traffic			2
on the scientific side , they hope to explore the different readings between the three sensors placed at different levels			2
they also hope to explain some mysterious patterns of shaking during commercial breaks , what one researcher says may be a ' dance quake			0
' several researchers will be at the @entity18 campus lab saturday monitoring the sensors			2
two group members will be at the stadium providing eyes on the ground to help explain what could be causing any unusual spikes			0
' we 're developing these new web tools , and monitoring the game really motivates everyone to get excited , ' dr @entity114 said , ' and we 're rooting for a second helping of roars and rumbles against the @entity252 or @entity253 to perfect the system			0

scientists from @entity18 will use sensors to see the strength of earthquakes caused by cheering fans
experiment will be at an @entity28 game in @entity29 on sunday
they hope to get readings 10 times more reliable than before
previous results showed fans can cause a one or two magnitude quake
the research could help monitor earthquakes in the @entity32
