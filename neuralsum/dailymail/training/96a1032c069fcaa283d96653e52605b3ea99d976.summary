' the couple were involved in the exploitation of two women brought into the @entity38 from @entity3 to work as prostitutes , ' said @entity58 , prosecuting , during the trial			1

she told the jury she did not know the two women had been trafficked			2

trial : a jury at @entity31 ( pictured ) took just five hours to find the couple guilty after the trial he had claimed that money came from his friend			2

' it is not that it is any fraud money or anything			0

' once the victims had entered the @entity38 , they were exploited and abused in the most brutal manner			2
human trafficking is totally unacceptable in our society			0
' i hope today ’s convictions will send a clear message that those who seek to degrade and demean others for their own personal gain can expect to be pursued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law			0
' it took an immense amount of courage for the victims to come forward and seek to break free from their ordeal			0
i hope that their courage will act as an inspiration for others who may find themselves in a similar position			0
' whilst we can not undo what has already happened to these victims , we can hope that today ’s convictions will help them as they try to move on from their ordeal			0
' a spokesman for the @entity263 , which led the investigation , said : ' trafficking is an appalling crime that has no place in today ’s society but , as this case has shown , it is taking place here			0
' that is why we are taking action on a number of fronts			0
' we are working with law enforcement overseas , the law is being strengthened and the @entity277 , one of the first of its kind in the world , will make it easier to prosecute the criminals behind trafficking and improve the protection of victims			2
