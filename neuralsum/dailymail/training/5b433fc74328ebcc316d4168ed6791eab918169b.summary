' you ca n't be pro choice except when you do n't like the choice ' : @entity3 made the comments online the head of the country ’s biggest abortion charity has said women are legally free to terminate pregnancies because they are unhappy with the sex of their unborn child			1
@entity3 , the chief executive of @entity13 , said no law prevents abortion on grounds of gender – and even compared it to abortion after rape			1
her organisation carries out more than a quarter of abortions in @entity22 and @entity23			2
mrs @entity3 ’s comments follow the decision earlier this month not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions – as part of a newspaper probe – for women who said they did not want girls			1
@entity32 , the director of public prosecutions , said that although there was a realistic prospect of securing convictions , it would be against the public interest to take the doctors to trial			0
the doctors ’ professional body , the @entity42 , can still strike them off			0
health secretary @entity43 called for ‘ urgent clarification ’ from mr @entity32 , while @entity46 ’s shadow attorney general , @entity45 , said : ‘ abortion on grounds of gender selection is a terrible crime , and the law is crystal clear on this			1
’ however , mrs @entity3 ’s comments have raised the question of whether this really is the case – and whether major abortion providers are quietly carrying out such terminations , which are thought to be increasingly common among some @entity58 communities			1
writing on the website spiked , mrs @entity3 said that if doctors decide that going through with a pregnancy will damage the mental health of the mother - to - be , then abortion is within the law			1
‘ a doctor agreeing to an abortion on grounds of rape would be breaking the law no more and no less than a doctor who agrees an abortion on grounds of sex selection , ’ she said			2
health secretary @entity43 has sought urgent clarification on the issue of whether or not doctors could be prosecuted for granting an abortion on the basis of gender ‘ while it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion , nor is rape , or incest , or being 13 years old			1
' nor is being homeless , or abandoned , or just feeling there ’s no way you can bring a child into the world ... yet they are all reasons why a doctor may believe a woman has met the legal grounds of abortion			1
’ she continued : ‘ the woman gives her reasons , the doctor decides on the grounds as set out in the law ... there is no legal requirement to deny a woman an abortion if she has a sex preference , providing that the legal grounds are still met			1
abortion has been legal since the @entity110 set out the grounds on which a woman ’s pregnancy may be terminated			1
the key clause says an abortion can be performed if two doctors decide ‘ the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman , or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family , greater than if the pregnancy were terminated ’			2
a further clause , giving weight to @entity3 ’s argument says ‘ account may be taken of the pregnant woman ’s actual or reasonably foreseeable environment ’			1
in other words , if doctors decide pressure in a family where girls are unwanted would affect the woman ’s mental health , they may approve a termination			0
‘ the law is silent on the matter of gender selection , just as it is silent on rape			2
’ mrs @entity3 claimed those who want to stop abortion on grounds of sex were hindering the pro-choice movement as much as anti-abortion protesters who picket clinics			1
‘ we either support women ’s capacity to decide , or we do n’t , ’ she said			0
‘ you ca n’t be pro-choice except when you do n’t like the choice , because that ’s not pro-choice at all			0
’ she questioned whether it is right that a woman pregnant with a girl should be made to have the baby if ‘ her family will disown her and she ’ll lose her home , her husband whom she loves , and her existing children ’			0
since abortion was made legal in 1967 , the overwhelming majority of terminations have been carried out on the basis that two doctors agree there is risk of injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman or her family			1
nearly 200,000 abortions in @entity22 and @entity23 are now carried out each year , and abortion ends more than one in five of all pregnancies			2
some 55,000 terminations are performed by @entity13 – formerly the @entity13 – each year in its clinics , which also provide advice and counselling to pregnant women			0
the charity received more than £ 26million in abortion fees last year , much of it paid by the taxpayer through the @entity190			0
anti-abortion campaigners responded with fury to the idea that sex - selection abortions are not only legally acceptable but should even be encouraged			1
divisive : the latest comments are sure to provoke strong reactions from both side of the debate on abortion @entity200 , of @entity201 , said the @entity110 should be the subject of an immediate inquiry by the @entity204 and @entity205			2
‘ the mental health clause amounts to abortion on demand , ’ he added			0
‘ why has the @entity205 not stamped out the conveyor - belting of women through the abortion clinics ? ’ he described abortion in @entity213 as a ‘ runaway bus ’ , asking : ‘ how else could gender - selection abortion – aborting unborn girls simply because they are female – be potentially widely available in abortion clinics across the country ? ’ @entity3 is a former magazine journalist who has become an outspoken leader of the abortion industry			1
in a decade running @entity13 , she has repeatedly challenged the widely - held assumption that abortion is a last resort for desperate women who stand to suffer deeply if they go ahead with their pregnancies			2
instead , critics say mrs @entity3 , 52 , has effectively championed the view of abortion as another form of contraception			1
she welcomed news that half of all pregnancies among girls under 18 end in abortion as ‘ a positive sign ’			0
a health writer for @entity238 and @entity239 , she became an abortion campaigner in the @entity241			0
she was @entity13 spokesman in 2000 when she declared that ‘ it may be time to understand that , for women , abortion is an essential method of family planning and accept it as such			0
’ she has run @entity13 since 2003 and earns £ 125,000			0
in 2009 , as @entity46 ’s ‘ teenage pregnancy strategy ’ to reduce pregnancies with more contraception and sex education collapsed , she saw an increase in abortion as the bright side			2
she said : ‘ this means more young women know how to get the care they need and if they have other plans for their teenage years aside from motherhood , they felt more able to make that choice			0
’ she is married to @entity261 , 66 , with whom she has an 18 - year - old son			0
the former student radical and founder of the @entity265 is @entity266 at @entity267 and a leading figure behind the @entity270 website on which his wife defended abortion on grounds of sex .			0
