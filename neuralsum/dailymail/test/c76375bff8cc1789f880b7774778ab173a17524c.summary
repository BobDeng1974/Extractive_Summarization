' at the time of the interview in 2011 @entity47 , from @entity48 , @entity49 , was still commanding £ 1,000 per day for her work			1
@entity47 looks cool and relaxed as she models the & @entity16 collection alongside the customised shoes ' that rate is quite rare but it 's very nice when it comes and helps the pension , ' she said			1
the model also comes from a time when it was ok to not be super skinny : ' i 'm a big - boned person and back in 1950 i was 10st 7lb , although nobody told me to lose weight			2

anyway , i could n’t afford it ! ’ she previously revealed to the @entity98 that she posed nude back in the day for artists such as @entity100			2
the outfits chosen for the campaign look great no matter what age the model is she revealed that she keeps her grey hair , which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign , long because it is cheaper			2
she said : ' my hair is long now because it ’s cheaper , i do n’t have to do anything , but put it in a topknot or a @entity114 pleat			0
' it avoids that old lady permed look , lengthens the neck and lifts the face			0
i ’ve got so many friends who do n’t touch the make - up pot. you should keep looking nice , it makes you feel so much better			2
