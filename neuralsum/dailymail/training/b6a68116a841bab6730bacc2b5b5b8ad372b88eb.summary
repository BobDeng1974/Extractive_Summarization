in june , an @entity0 investigation found that @entity22 entered the @entity23 in 1949 by failing to disclose to @entity23 authorities his role as a commander in the @entity6 - led @entity27 , which is accused of torching villages and killing civilians in @entity9			1
the investigation found that @entity22 was in the area of the massacres , but did not uncover evidence linking him directly to atrocities			2
the @entity0 has uncovered testimony that says @entity22 , a @entity2 man who was a @entity6 - led company commander , ordered his men to attack a village that was razed to the ground in 1944 , contradicting claims by the man 's family that he was never at the scene of the civilian massacre however , an investigative file originally from the @entity50 intelligence agency 's archive but unearthed and published this week by @entity0 reveals that a private under @entity22 's command testified in 1968 that @entity22 ordered the assault on @entity54 in retaliation for the slaying of an ss major			1
the major , slain by resistance fighters , led the @entity27 , in which @entity22 was a company commander			1
a @entity61 roster of the unit confirms that pvt. @entity63 , a @entity50 , served under @entity22 's command at the time			1
an initial order was given by a separate officer , @entity63 testified , before @entity22 told his unit to attack the village			1
' the command was given by one of the commanders to cordon off the village and prepare for battle , ' @entity63 said , according to the @entity74 - language investigative file , which bears the stamp of @entity50 's @entity77 regional prosecutors ' office			2
' the commander of our company , @entity78 , also gave the command to cordon off the village and check all the houses , and to find and punish the partisans			2
' @entity22 fought under the @entity85 , ' and he wrote a 1995 @entity50 - language war memoir under both his real name and the pseudonym ' @entity78			2
' according to the document , @entity63 described how nobody was spared in the ferocious onslaught on @entity92			0

' most of the houses were burned as a result of this action			0
how many people were killed in all , i do n't know			0
i personally saw three corpses of peaceful inhabitants who had been killed			0
' the @entity0 learned of the file 's existence after its initial report and subsequently tracked down and reviewed its contents			2
other eyewitness accounts , both from villagers and members of @entity138 's unit , corroborate the testimony that the company set buildings on fire and gunned down more than 40 men , women and children			1
@entity22 continues to live quietly in @entity146 as he has for decades			2
@entity22 's son and family spokesman , @entity149 , has denied his 94 - year - old father 's involvement in the @entity54 incident or any other possible war crime			1
@entity149 , who spells his surname differently from his father , refused to comment on the @entity63 testimony when reached by phone : ' until and unless @entity0 can provide their alleged evidence and their witness , we will not respond to your defamatory and slanderous allegation , ' he said friday			2
@entity63 died in the 1980s			0
in july , weeks after @entity22 's commanding role in the @entity6 - led @entity27 was revealed , @entity149 questioned the statements from men in his father 's unit and comments in his father 's memoir suggesting he was at the scene			1
he was cited by the @entity172 as saying his father told him he was not in @entity54 when the killings took place , and wrote in a letter to the same newspaper that his father was no war criminal			0
' there is no record that @entity22 had a hand in any war crimes , ' @entity149 wrote			0
' he did nothing wrong			0
he 's not afraid of the truth			0
' @entity185 intel : this file undated reproduction shows a page of @entity22 's 1949 @entity185 intelligence file that the @entity0 had declassified by the @entity190 in @entity191 through a @entity193 request			1
officials note in the document that @entity22 told them he performed no military service during the war ; working for his father until 1944 and in a labor camp from 1944 to 45 @entity199 destroyed : this june 19 , 2013 file photo , a woman stands near a mass grave and a monument in the village of @entity54 , @entity9 , that holds the bodies of @entity9 killed in a 1944 attack on the village by the @entity6 - led @entity27			1
the @entity0 has uncovered testimony that says @entity22 , a @entity2 man who was a @entity50 @entity27 company commander , ordered his men to attack the village @entity211 , who led @entity6 investigations for nine years as a prosecutor at the @entity23 @entity215 's @entity214 , said the @entity63 testimony is highly credible and should bolster cases in @entity106 and @entity9 to launch prosecutions against @entity22			1
he noted that @entity63 did not appear to be in custody or under investigation at the time of his questioning , and that many of his statements are confirmed by historical documents			0
' i see no reason to doubt that is what ( @entity63 ) said and that it was said without any pressure , ' said @entity211 , now a law professor at the @entity231			0
' and that 's exactly the sort of thing that would help persuade a judge that it 's credible — that there 's other evidence to corroborate the other things that he said			0
... there 's no indication in the @entity97 statement that the guy they were interviewing had a motive to lie			0
' since the initial report , both @entity61 and @entity9 prosecutors have opened investigations into whether to charge @entity22 with war crimes , based on the fact he had ' command responsibility ' for his unit when it committed massacres			1
@entity22 was a founding member of the @entity6 - led @entity254 and later an officer in the @entity256			1
@entity106 has in recent years taken the position that people suspected of @entity6 crimes must be prosecuted , no matter how old or infirm , as it did in the case of retired @entity262 autoworker @entity261 , who died last year at age 91 while appealing his conviction as a guard at the @entity267 death camp			2
@entity268 , who is deputy head of @entity106 's special prosecutors ' office that investigates @entity6 crimes , said he is working ' intensively ' to conclude his probe as soon as possible , especially in view of @entity22 's advanced age			1
@entity9 prosecutors said their investigation was ongoing — and that they have told the @entity276 they need to ask ' the @entity23 side to question ( @entity22 ) in the capacity of a suspect			1
' they referred further queries to the ministry , which did not respond to requests for comment			0
roster list : this undated reproduction provided by the @entity286 in @entity287 , southern @entity9 , is a @entity6 administrative file probably dated 1944 showing a roster list for the @entity254 , identifying @entity290 as the top commander of ii company home : in this june 14 , 2013 file photo , people walk past the home in @entity146 , where 94 - year - old @entity22 lives the @entity23 @entity215 refused to comment on whether it had initiated its own investigation or was aiding the @entity9 investigation			1
' the @entity215 is aware of the allegations , which have been widely published , ' spokesman @entity299 wrote in an email			0
' we generally do not confirm nor deny whether an individual is under investigation			0
' even without the @entity307 testimony there is a case against @entity22 from the evidence uncovered in the initial report , @entity211 said			2
' if he gave the order , there 's no question he 's guilty of war crimes , ' @entity211 said in a telephone interview			0
' even if he did n't give the order , as the commander in the area it was his responsibility — if he knew about it to stop it , and if he learned about it after to investigate it and punish those responsible			0
that 's what command responsibility is			0
' other soldiers who served under @entity22 back up @entity63 's testimony about civilian killings : @entity329 , also a private , told @entity97 investigators that in 1944 that unit was directed to ' liquidate all the residents ' of @entity54 — although he did not say who gave the order			1
@entity63 also testified in the investigative documents that @entity22 's company was directly involved in a ' punitive mission ' against @entity9 near the village of @entity339 in 1944			1
' we were told that @entity9 had attacked the village of @entity339 and were killing @entity50 families , ' @entity63 said			2
' and that 's why we had to defend the families of @entity50 and take revenge against the @entity9			2
' @entity63 made his statements to authorities in @entity50 in 1967 and 1968 for an investigation they were conducting against the @entity27			0
the documents noted he was living at the time in the village of @entity352 in @entity50			0
local official @entity353 said @entity63 had been a resident , and died in the mid- 1980s			0
many of @entity63 's statements are backed up by other evidence and historical fact , giving weight to the overall testimony , said @entity361 professor @entity360 , a @entity50 - born political scientist who has done extensive research on the @entity27			2
' i analyzed several hundred such @entity97 - era investigative cases for my academic research projects , ' he said			0
' based on this research and direct or indirect corroboration of information from the @entity63 's testimony by other sources — including the @entity138 memoirs , his testimony concerning the @entity27 , massacres that it committed , and the involvement of @entity22 in the specific massacre — looks credible			1

retired @entity2 carpenter , @entity22 , was shown in a june investigation to be a former commander in a @entity6 - led unit
according to testimony newly uncovered by @entity0 , he ordered his men to attack a @entity9 village that was razed to the ground
