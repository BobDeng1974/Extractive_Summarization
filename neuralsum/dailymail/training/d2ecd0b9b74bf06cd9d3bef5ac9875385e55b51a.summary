the hosts are the most successful team in @entity2 history and if they are to add to their five tournament wins they must get past a country becoming known for going far in major competitions without winning them			0
@entity7 - to - head in their 21 meetings , @entity9 have won 12 with @entity12 recording just four victories			1
they have faced each other just once in a @entity2 , @entity9 winning 2 - 0 in the 2002 final			1
but in their last match , , a friendly in august 2011 , @entity12 won 3 - 2			1
what @entity9 are worrying about ... they are missing their two best players — @entity23 has a fractured vertebra in his back and centre back and captain @entity27 is suspended			1
the pair have been superb , @entity23 providing the goals and flair and @entity27 dominating at the back			0
what @entity12 are worrying about ... it could get messy			1
the @entity34 have been criticised for their brutal , aggressive style of play on the way to this semi-final			2
they have committed the most amount of fouls in the tournament and have their midfield enforcer @entity42 back from suspension			0
the @entity44 will expect a few heavy challenges			0
what the bookies say it ’s close , but the bookies are giving @entity9 ( 6/4 ) , playing at home and more used to the conditions , the edge over @entity12 ( 9/5 )			1
where can i watch it ? @entity56 from 8.30pm ( kick - off 9pm )			0
this could turn into the @entity60 v @entity61 show with both players having been instrumental in getting their sides this far , but they have more than enough star quality around them to turn this into a mouthwatering fixture			0
@entity7 - to - head @entity70 have been the stronger side , having won four of their eight meetings to @entity76 ’s one victory — but that one came in the 1978 @entity78			1
the last time they met was in the group stage of the 2006 @entity2 in @entity82 , which ended in a goalless draw			0
what @entity70 are worrying about ... @entity60			2
he scored four goals in the group stage to haul @entity76 through , and while his team - mates have shrunk on the big stage , he has been virtually unplayable			2
what @entity76 are worrying about ... they have a plethora of talent but have struggled to integrate it in a way that would allow them to crush their opponents			2
what the bookies say @entity76 ( 5/4 ) have been made the firm favourites , well ahead of @entity70 ( 11/5 )			1
where can i watch it ? @entity103 from 8.30pm ( 9pm kick off )			0
stage : the @entity105 in @entity106 will host the @entity2 final on sunday			0
