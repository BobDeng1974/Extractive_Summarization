prince @entity0 is expected to hold crisis talks with the @entity2 today as he returned to @entity3 after a luxury holiday amid the growing furore over claims he had sex with an under - age girl			1
the @entity0 last night appeared in public for the first time since he was accused of abusing the girl ‘ procured ’ for him by his close friend and convicted paedophile , @entity16			1
the prince – who looked sombre as he left his luxury £ 22,000 - a - week @entity20 ski chalet yesterday – is today expected to meet with his most senior aides and lawyers in his mansion close to @entity24			1
it is also understood he will reassure his mother at the earliest possible opportunity that the claims he faces are false			0
the extraordinary allegation was made by @entity30 as part of a @entity33 civil case against shamed billionaire @entity16			1
she claims prince @entity0 had sex with her when she was 17 – a minor under @entity33 law – and employed as a ‘ sex slave ’ by @entity16			1
last night her father said prince @entity0 should be prosecuted if the claims were true			1
@entity65 , 58 , also claimed his daughter @entity67 had been introduced to the @entity2 while visiting @entity59 with billionaire financier @entity16			1
the sexual allegations were robustly denied by @entity69 in an unprecedented three public statements , which describe them as ‘ false and without foundation ’			1
a spokesman also insisted about allegations about meeting the @entity2 last night : ' there is nothing to suggest the claim is true			2
we have no record of such a meeting			0
' but the scandal has showed no sign of abating			0
sources close to the prince admitted he had been ‘ guilty of a poor choice of friend ’ , with one saying : ‘ i do n’t think anyone , not even the duke himself , would defend that friendship			0
’ there were also questions last night over the extraordinary legal deal that it is thought to have resulted in prince @entity0 – as well as other associates of @entity16 – having immunity from any future prosecution			1
according to a former @entity100 state attorney , the controversial deal was struck amid an astonishing and aggressive campaign by @entity16 ’s lawyers to defend their client against claims of depraved activities			2
facing the music : pursing his lips pensively , prince @entity0 walked to his car in full view of photographers crisis talks : the royal , above , is expected to speak with his most senior aides and lawyers tomorrow the deal meant @entity16 – who was suspected for decades of paying for sex with dozens of under - age girls – was only ever convicted and jailed for 18 months on a single charge of soliciting paid sex with minors in 2008			1
documents filed at a court in @entity100 further allege that prince @entity0 was among those who made ‘ efforts ’ to secure the paedophile a favourable deal			1
the legal claim refers to ‘ @entity16 ’s lobbying efforts to persuade the [ @entity33 ] government to give him a more favourable plea arrangement and / or non-prosecution agreement , including efforts on his behalf by @entity0 ’			1
this has been strongly denied by the @entity69 , with an official telling the @entity136 yesterday : ‘ the duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case			2
’ friday : ‘ this relates to long - standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the @entity33 , to which the @entity0 is not a party			2
as such we would not comment on the detail			0
however , for the avoidance of doubt , any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue			0
’ @entity153 : ‘ a very serious allegation , of sex with a minor , was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a @entity33 court			2
the earlier statement categorically rejected that claim ; and as was indicated at the time , we do not intend to comment further			0
’ saturday evening : in response to specific claims about @entity0 ’s alleged conduct : ‘ it is emphatically denied that the @entity0 had any form of sexual contact or relationship with @entity30			1
any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation			0

last night police sources were reported to have said they would investigate if miss @entity30 made a formal complaint against the prince			2
a @entity180 spokesman told the @entity181 : ‘ we have not received any allegations			0
if we did receive a complaint we would investigate it			0

@entity0 has no immediate public engagements in his diary but the @entity136 understands that he still plans to fly to @entity206 in @entity20 for the @entity207 on january 21			2
sources say he will host a reception there for foreign ministers and business leaders in a personal capacity , as he has done in previous years , as part of a ‘ business as usual ’ strategy			0
one senior royal aide said : ‘ there is no suggestion that this will be changed or cancelled			0
he is pushing forward with his existing schedule			0
’ another source said @entity0 felt ‘ frustrated ’ by the scandal , but decided that the seriousness of the allegations being made left him ‘ no option but to speak out ’			2
