the attacks took place while @entity1 , a convicted arsonist and crack addict was lodging with his brother @entity4 and the boy ’s mother @entity4 in @entity40 , north @entity41			1
the case sparked a national scandal after it emerged how social workers , police and doctors all missed a string of warning signs that could have saved the youngster ’s life			0
officials assigned to @entity14 did not ask about @entity52 , who was @entity14 ’s boyfriend , even when she listed him as next of kin			2
had they done so , they would have discovered he had been suspected of torturing his grandmother			0
social workers considered the child ’s care to be ‘ a routine , low - risk case ’ and were too scared to confront @entity14			0
