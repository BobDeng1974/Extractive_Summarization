the @entity0 has revealed that evidence so far suggests the @entity2 used under - inflated balls in the first half of their afc championship game against the @entity6			1
an investigation is continuing into allegations the @entity2 deliberately sabotaged the balls in their 45 - 7 victory at the @entity11 on sunday , which set up a @entity13 showdown with the @entity14 in nine days ' time			1
yet one of sport 's most prestigious events has been overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the @entity2 , for whom quarter - back @entity20 launched an impassioned defence of his side on thursday			2
the @entity0 released evidence that suggested the balls used in the @entity27 were under - inflated but the @entity0 , while admitting its probe was far from concluded , said that it , so far , appeared the balls used by the @entity2 in the opening half were below regulation pressure limits of between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch			1
the statement did not say whether that was intentional , though , and added that the balls used in the second half were ' properly inflated '			2

the @entity2 practice in @entity41 ahead of their @entity13 showdown against @entity43 @entity2 quarterback @entity20 launched an impassionate defence of the @entity2 the @entity0 said in a statement on its official website : ' the investigation is ongoing , will be thorough and objective , and is being pursued expeditiously			1
