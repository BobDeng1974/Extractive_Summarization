by @entity1 reporter published : 12:23 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 06:18 est , 20 november 2013 nurses are being left in charge of up to 22 frail patients at night , figures show			2
patients are routinely having to wait in agony for almost an hour before a nurse can administer pain relief			1
senior nurses also say they are having to give advice to junior doctors because there are so few consultants on the wards			2
' unacceptable ' : the @entity16 says it is not safe to have just one registered nurse looking after a ward overnight figures show that at two hospitals – @entity21 and @entity22 , both part of @entity24 – one nurse was left in charge of 22 elderly patients at night			1
at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , there was one nurse for 21 patients while there was one for 16 patients at @entity36 hospital , in @entity37			1
the figures were obtained under the @entity39 by the @entity16			1
they emerged as the government announced plans yesterday for hospitals to publish the number of nurses working on each ward			1
patients will be able to check the figures for their local hospital – as well as the percentage of shifts that meet ' safe staffing ' levels – on a new @entity55 safety website from next june			1
the @entity16 says there should be at least one nurse for every eight patients , although there are no national guidelines			1
one registered nurse : @entity61 was one of the hospitals that had one registered nurse working @entity64 , a member of the @entity16 's @entity66 branch , said nurses had been ringing her in tears , distressed that they were unable to help patients in pain			1
miss @entity64 said : ' we started to get calls from nurses very distressed , saying they were doing shifts on their own			0
it 's an unbearable emotional burden for them if they can not help patients – as nurses they want to be able to care			2
' nurses can not give good , compassionate care or even check pain - killing medication in those circumstances			0
it 's just not safe and is completely unacceptable			1
' the majority of patients in hospital are over 70 and they are often very dependent on help			2
' rules state that there must be two nurses present if a patient is being given certain types of injection , including pain relief into their muscles or veins			0
but if there is only one nurse on a ward overnight , they would have to wait for a colleague to come from a different area of the hospital before they can administer treatment			1
this can mean patients are left waiting in pain for up to 45 minutes before the extra nurse arrives			1
@entity113 : the @entity16 is part of the @entity113 , which says there should be a minimum of one nurse caring for every eight patients trusts were not able to break down the freedom of information request results to explain whether the solitary member of staff on duty was on a full - time or temporary contract			1
the @entity16 is part of the @entity113 , which says there should be a minimum of one nurse caring for every eight patients			1
the figure is based on research from @entity129 , which found that hospitals with more than eight patients per registered nurse ( during the day time on general acute wards ) would see around 20 extra deaths a year than better staffed hospitals			1
the @entity16 said in a report : ' anecdotally , we had heard from members and the public that registered nurses in some hospitals were looking after wards single - handedly with only a healthcare assistant in support			1
' nurses were also covering at night to support inexperienced junior doctors due to a shortage of senior medical supervision			0
' ' the survey shows that all hospitals were struggling to cover night shifts and relied on hundreds of temporary staff ( bank and agency nursing staff plus locum doctors ) to look after patients			1
' the @entity16 says on january 14 , five hospitals had inpatient wards staffed by one registered nurse			1
' this would result in delays for patients receiving pain relief and intravenous fluids			2
' the report continued , ' at best , the clinical outcomes for patients in these areas on the night surveyed should have been documented as a " near miss clinical incident "			2
' @entity28 : the @entity30 hospital was one of the five hospitals to have one nurse working on the chosen evening a spokesman for @entity28 said they only had five patients in the ward on the night of the survey			1
he said : ' the report only looks at the number of beds in the ward , not the number of patients			2
' at the time in question , there were only five patients in the ward			2
we had full cover from one full - time nurse and a health care assistant , which is much higher than the recommended staffing cover			2
' a spokesman for @entity61 said : ' we are passionate about nursing and have made a huge commitment and investment to increase our nursing workforce during 2013 to care for higher numbers of patients and higher levels of sickness			1
' we have increased the number of nursing posts and the number of nursing staff in post while at the same time reducing the number of vacancies			0
' the trust has more nurses working evenings and weekends and we ’ve also been recruiting more experienced , senior nurses so that there will be three @entity212 nurses working on each ward			2
' we ’re also currently implementing a recommendation of the @entity216 report which is to make all ward senior nurses ‘ supervisory ’ and recruiting more nurses to do the hands - on nursing work they currently carry out			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity223 said : ‘ we are pleased to report that in may our @entity224 agreed to invest an additional £ 3.9 million per year to recruit 160 additional nurses to staff our inpatient wards , with temporary and agency nurses being employed ( to fill the shortfall ) whilst permanent staff were recruited			0
‘ since june , we have offered jobs to 196 nurses ( which covers the 160 additional nurses , as well as emerging vacancies , i.e. as other nurses retire or leave our hospitals )			0
60 of these nurses have already started			0
‘ we now review our ward staffing on a daily basis to ensure our levels are appropriate and will shortly start publishing them at our ward entrances			0
’ the health minister 's reforms come in the wake of the @entity247 scandal			0
he told @entity249 ' cruelty became the norm in the @entity55 and no - one noticed ' and said his new measures , including publishing @entity254 - style ratings for hospitals , will give patients confidence in the health system			1
officials suggest the new regime would prevent those such as @entity262 , the chief executive of @entity263 when up to 1,200 died needlessly , from ever running a trust again			0
inquiry : @entity266 died at the @entity267 a great - grandmother @entity266 died after calling her family from her hospital bed to say she could n't breathe			0
her son , @entity270 , rushed to her side at the @entity267 but when he arrived 20 minutes later she had died			0
the hospital 's inquiry showed a catalogue of errors and said the 84 - year - old should not have been left on her own ' at any stage '			0
it also said there was a ' delay in obtaining antibiotics in liquid form ' and a reduced number of nurses on the ward at one point close to when she died			0
an investigation revealed failings in care and chief executive @entity291 has now written to her family to say sorry			0
' it is clear from our investigation that you and your family had a very poor experience whilst your mother was under our care , and for this i am extremely sorry , ' he wrote			0
mr @entity291 , admitted her son , @entity270 , ' found her alone , with the observation machine alarming and sadly it appeared that your mother had very recently passed away '			0
mr @entity291 said there has since been a change in leadership on @entity309 and a ' very experienced ' ward sister has since been recruited .			0

@entity16 said it was not safe and labelled it ' unacceptable '
