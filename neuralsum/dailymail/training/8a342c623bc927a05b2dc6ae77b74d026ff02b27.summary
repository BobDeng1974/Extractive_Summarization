all those who have been wondering what effect the legalization of same - marriage marriage has had on @entity4 now have their answer , and all thanks to self - proclaimed ' redneck news reporter ' @entity8			1
on monday , @entity8 posted a hilarious video on his @entity11 page shot on his property near @entity13 , @entity4 , in which he tries – and fails - to find evidence that gay marriage is destroying @entity16			1
the video , which clocks in at under 2 minutes , begins with mr @entity8 dressed in a camouflage sweatshirt filing a report from the field on the state of his county in the aftermath of a federal court ruling allowing same - sex couples to get marriage licenses			1
not your average ' redneck ' : self - proclaimed ' redneck news reporter ' @entity8 has made a funny video in which he tries – and fails - to find evidence that gay marriage is destroying @entity16 , @entity4 no same - sex couples here ! as a way to prove that nothing has changed in his home state in the aftermath of the court ruling legalizing same - sex marriage , @entity8 showed viewers a pile of branches ( left ) and his shed ( right ) , where he said there were no homosexuals to be found ‘ i read on the news today some information that homosexuals will be getting married in the @entity4 today , and i wanted to give you a live report from @entity16 , ’ the intrepid correspondent says into the camera			1
@entity8 's cell phone camera then pans over to a heap of tree branches lying on the ground in his yard			1
' this pile of brush is still here , and there are no homosexuals laying on top of it , doing homosexual things , ' @entity8 deadpans			1
he then walks over to a cluttered outbuilding , peers inside and says : ' none in the shed either , but we 've got to check into this further			2
' after checking on his ' pile of junk ' to make sure it has not been taken over by homosexuals , @entity8 concludes that the residents of @entity16 are safe			1
@entity78 : the beer - loving , cigar - smoking @entity79 has become somewhat of an internet phenomenon since posting the video of his @entity11 page @entity84 and gatherer : despite his penchant for camo clothing and his passion for hunting , @entity8 has described himself as a liberal guy ' we 're not gon na be subjected to any kind of plagues of homosexuals falling from the sky , ' he says			1
but @entity8 cautions his audience that he did see a couple of squirrels that looked ' kinda suspect			2
' ' so we should look into that further ‘ cause it may be spreading into the squirrel population , ’ he quips			0
as of friday evening , @entity8 ’s satirical video has been viewed more than 766,000 times and shared 13,225 times on @entity11			1
in a follow - up interview with local blogger @entity105 , @entity8 explained that as a ' liberal type of guy , ' he decided to make the video after witnessing a lot of ' backward things ' in his home state			1
‘ our county is dry and people around here are living in the past , ’ he said in the interview			0
‘ my goal with this video is to show people that the sky is not falling because gay marriage is now legal			0
‘ no one is going to wake up gay , i woke up this morning straight as ever			0
everyone is getting too wound up about it			0
’ after initial panic sparked by the legalization of same - sex marriage , most counties in @entity4 sided with federal courts rather than their own chief justice , a @entity130 who once called homosexuality an inherent evil			2
@entity135 district judge @entity134 issued a strongly worded order thursday saying that a judge could no longer deny marriage licenses to gays and lesbians , reiterating her ruling striking down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage			1
progress : officials in 16 @entity4 counties began issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples february 13 , a day after a federal judge ordered a local official to issue the licenses in accordance with an earlier ruling @entity155 : @entity156 , right , and @entity157 , left , celebrate with a kiss after receiving their marriage license on friday			1
they were the first couple to apply for and receive a marriage license from @entity164 for a same sex marriage sealed with kisses : @entity167 , left , and @entity168 both of @entity169 , @entity4 , get married in a double wedding with @entity171 , second from right , and her partner @entity173 , at @entity174 in @entity175 ' these numbers represent a seismic shift in favor of equality and justice			0
resistance to happy , loving and committed same - sex couples getting married is quickly crumbling throughout the state , ' said @entity184 , a top spokesman for the @entity185 , which has been lobbying to expand gay rights nationwide			1
@entity188 's ruling enabling gays to get licenses went into effect monday after the @entity135 @entity192 declined to intervene			2
but even then , @entity4 chief justice @entity193 said county judges were not bound by her decision			0
' it 's my duty to speak up when i see the jurisdiction of our courts being intruded by unlawful federal authority , ' @entity193 insisted in an interview with the @entity203 later monday			0
about 20 of @entity4 's counties allowed gays and lesbians to wed on monday			0
by friday that number had jumped to at least 47 , the @entity185 said			0
other counties said they would revisit the decision next week			0
@entity134 's ruling made @entity4 the 37th state where gays and lesbians can legally wed. while many @entity130 politicians in @entity4 criticized her ruling last month and tried to link her to @entity216 administration policies , @entity134 was appointed to the federal bench by president @entity218			2
arc of history : after initial panic sparked by the legalization of same - sex marriage , most counties in @entity4 sided with federal courts rather than their own chief justice who once called homosexuality an inherent evil @entity134 could have stayed her decision pending a final @entity135 @entity192 ruling , as federal judges in @entity232 and @entity233 did			1
instead , she rejected @entity4 's argument that keeping gays and lesbians from marrying benefits the state 's children			2
and after @entity193 urged judges this week to ignore her ruling , she reiterated that they are bound by the @entity240 to treat all couples equally			0
@entity193 's stand against federal authority surprised no one in @entity4 , where the 68 - year - old jurist who twice ran for governor burnished his conservative image a decade ago with a losing fight to keep his @entity250 statue inside the @entity251			2
while @entity193 again appeared on the losing side friday , a longtime supporter said the 81 percent of @entity4 voters who chose to ban gay marriage in 2006 would appreciate his stand			0
' i think this lady judge is scaring the daylights out of these people , ' @entity259 businessman @entity258 said			0
' the people are very thankful that judge @entity193 is standing up			0

@entity8 's video shows him reporting on the state of his county in the aftermath of the same - sex court ruling
to prove that nothing has changed , @entity8 shows a pile of branches and his shed , where he says there are no homosexuals to be found
