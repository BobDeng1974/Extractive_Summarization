@entity1 's @entity0 could end up spending months in a @entity4 animal shelter after the singer was given an extension to sort out the paperwork needed to get the animal back			1
the animal was confiscated by customs officials in @entity11 as @entity1 flew in from @entity12 to perform a series of concerts			1
now the pop star is trying to get his pet back			0
@entity0 , a capuchin monkey , was given to the singer for his 19th birthday last month from music producer @entity20			1
he had been taken away from his mother when he was only nine weeks old			2
he is now in quarantine in a @entity11 animal sanctuary where his only companion is a cuddly toy that he treats as a surrogate mother			1
@entity0 also spends his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding other members of his family group - something which animal shelter boss @entity46 , 64 , described as ' heartbreaking '			1
he said : ' @entity1 has won an extension because the four week limit on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch			2
' however his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get the paperwork ready			2
' if that takes months then it 's months that they have			0
but that just is n't acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life			0
' we 'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption			0
the boss of the @entity11 animal shelter asked @entity1 to do ' the decent thing ' and let the animal be adopted @entity0 spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group , animal shelter staff said ' there are a great many suitable places that have offered to take @entity0 and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind			1
' a baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet			0
' he should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he is n't to have serious psychological problems later in life			0
' a source familiar with the situation told @entity98 : ' there are ongoing discussions to ensure the best conditions for the monkey			0
' a @entity4 customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that @entity1 lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species - protection regulations			1
@entity46 said if it took months to sort out the paperwork and all that time was spent in a cage it would do irreparable damage to the monkey 's mental state			2
he said if @entity1 were to refuse to allow the monkey to be adopted by a suitable organisation then the only hope lay with the @entity122 environment ministry			1
however the @entity123 has so far declined to comment on the case .			0
