@entity0 forgot about @entity2 's team huddle moments before kick - off as @entity5 's side beat @entity6 3 - 1 at @entity7			1
as the rest of the @entity2 squad came together to rouse themselves for the fixture against the @entity12 , @entity0 appears oblivious as he makes his way to his position ready for the start of the match			2
the @entity18 midfielder was caught on camera trotting off as he completed his own final preparations , failing to realise he had left a gaping hole in the huddle			0
as the @entity2 squad come together for a pre-match huddle @entity0 is oblivious the @entity18 midfielder completes his own final preparations as he leaves a hole in the huddle team - mates call him over and @entity0 jogs towards the rest of squad for the pre-match pep talk the 21 - year - old ( far left ) finally took his place in the huddle before @entity2 beat @entity6 3 - 1 the 21 - year - old 's team - mates are seen calling @entity0 over to listen to captain @entity34 's pre-match pep talk			1
he leisurely turns and jogs back towards the huddle and eventually joins his team - mates			0
the incident obviously did n't effect the former @entity40 player 's performance as he gave @entity2 a first - half lead with a glancing header and set the @entity2 on the road to victory .			0
