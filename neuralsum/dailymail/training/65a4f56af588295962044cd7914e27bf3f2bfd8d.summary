@entity1 legend @entity0 has revealed that if he was in charge at the club he would only have signed under - fire striker @entity4 as a last resort in the summer transfer window			1
@entity0 , who last week criticised @entity4 for swapping shirts with @entity9 ’s @entity8 at half - time while the @entity11 were 3 - 0 down against the @entity13 giants , says he would have evaluated every other option available before signing the controversial @entity15			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity17 at the @entity18 he said : ‘ i would have taken @entity4 on the last day of the window , but not before			2
videos scroll down to watch @entity4 continues to struggle for form in a @entity1 shirt , again firing a blank in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity25 @entity4 courted controversy this week when he swapped shirts with @entity9 's @entity8 at half - time @entity1 legend @entity0 says the club should have signed @entity4 only as a last resort ‘ i would have tried to look at every other option which was out there to see if the right player could be found and a deal could be done			1
‘ and then on the last day if you do n’t get anyone and he ( @entity4 ) is still keen on coming to the club i would have taken him , but i would n’t have taken him a week before – that ’s for sure			0
‘ having said that i ’d rather have him at the club than not have him at all , because i think he can produce the moments of magic which can win you games			0
we just have n’t seen that yet			0
' despite his criticism of @entity4 last week , @entity0 insists the 24 - year - old is being made a scapegoat at @entity1 to disguise their poor form , with the @entity11 already eight points off leaders @entity52 , having played a game more			1
he added : ‘ he is part of a team that is struggling and is not playing well but all the blame seems to be directed onto him – he ’s an easy target			0
@entity4 tries to beat @entity25 's @entity59 and goalkeeper @entity60 to the ball @entity4 appeals in vain for a penalty after colliding with @entity25 defender @entity64 ‘ he is not playing any differently to what he has done in the last five years			1
you know what you ’re getting with @entity4 , and the only difference with him now to previous years is that he ’s not scoring			0
‘ i do n’t think he ’s as good as people make out but he is a very talented player and could be a success at @entity1			2
‘ i ’ve been critical of @entity4 recently ( the shirt swapping incident ) , but i feel the criticism elsewhere has been overboard in particular after the @entity9 game			2
‘ he should n’t have swapped shirts with @entity8 but ultimately it had no bearing on the result and the way @entity1 played			1
‘ they ’ve been under par most of the season and have struggled for results and that is n’t @entity4 ’s fault			0
he needs support now from everyone at @entity1 because the last thing he needs is people hitting him over the head with a sledgehammer			0

@entity0 says @entity1 should have only signed out - of - form striker @entity4 if nobody else was available
the @entity15 has scored just one goal since *joining* from @entity98
he was criticised for half - time shirt swap with @entity8 in *midweek*
@entity1 drew another blank against @entity25 on *saturday*
but @entity0 believes @entity4 will come good eventually
