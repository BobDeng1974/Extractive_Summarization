but in one small town in @entity13 , this tradition means a little bit more , as it is where the first ever @entity4 baubles were made			2
while the glass balls bought today may have been manufactured in @entity19 , @entity20 , or the @entity21 , the originals were invented in @entity13 and a small mountain village of @entity23 is considered to be the birthplace of the handmade , glass - blown @entity4 bauble			2
the spirit of @entity4 : a shop in @entity23 , in the @entity13 state of @entity29 , displays the locally produced @entity4 baubles birthplace of the bauble : the family of @entity35 work on @entity4 balls in their combined living room and work space in the small village of @entity23 still going strong : there are now 20 small glass - blowing companies in the mountain village of @entity23 in @entity13 @entity29 in the late 16th century , @entity23 , in the @entity13 state of @entity29 , became known for its excellence in glass - blowing			1
@entity23 , located in a river valley , had several elements needed for glass - making : timber , for firing the glass ovens , and sand			0
in 1597 , @entity54 and @entity55 set up @entity23 's first glassworks and very soon , @entity53 ( glassworks ) were established in the town			0
@entity23 's @entity58 eventually produced drinking glasses , flasks , glass bowls , glass beads ( @entity63 ) , and in 1835 , local glass blower @entity65 - @entity64 invented the artificial human eye from glass			0
the original decorations : the earliest hand blown @entity4 tree ornaments from glass were attached to each other to form a chain the factories in the town became state - owned while under the @entity13 communist government @entity4 antiques : glass - blown balls for the christmas tree dating back from the 1860s in 1847 @entity55 began producing glass ornaments in the shape of fruits and nuts			1
the inside of the ornament was made to look silvery , at first with mercury or lead , then later using a special compound of silver nitrate and sugar water			0
soon these unique glass @entity4 ornaments were being exported to other parts of @entity95			0
by the 1870s , @entity23 was exporting its unique glass ornaments to @entity99			0
glass ornaments had become popular in 1846 when an illustration of @entity104 @entity103 's christmas tree was printed in a @entity106 paper			1
the royal tree was decorated with glass ornaments from @entity110 's native land of @entity13			2
realistic : the glass masters of @entity23 could already make high quality , life like artificial human eyes in the 19th century a beautiful display of @entity4 ornaments in a @entity23 shop , left , and @entity4 ornaments hand blown to a mold from early 20th century in the glass museum of @entity23 , right these old baubles that capture the spirit of @entity4 can still be seen in a @entity23 museum in the 1880s the @entity21 dime - store magnate @entity124 discovered @entity23 's @entity125 during a visit to @entity13			1
he made a fortune by importing the @entity13 glass ornaments to the @entity21 unfortunately , the end of @entity130 meant that @entity13 's communist government turned most of @entity23 's glassworks into state - owned concerns and it was n't until the @entity134 came down , that most of the firms were re-established as private companies			1
today there are still about 20 small glass - blowing firms active in @entity23 and to celebrate this festive heritage , a famous christmas ball - market takes place every year which attracts thousands of visitors to this snow topped picturesque location			1
