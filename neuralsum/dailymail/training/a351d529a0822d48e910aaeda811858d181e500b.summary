by @entity0 published : 19:19 est , 3 january 2013 updated : 03:10 est , 4 january 2013 @entity1 up with our perpetually soggy weather ? then here ’s some news to further dampen your spirits			0
forecasters warned yesterday that the country faces even more intense downpours in future years , with increased risks of flooding			2
the number of days of ‘ extreme rainfall ’ – particularly heavy downpours – increased by 40 per cent last year , making 2012 the @entity16 ’s second wettest year ever			1
extreme flooding : only part of a road can be seen above the flood water from the @entity21 near @entity22 , @entity23 , a sight which may become less shocking according to forecasters extreme rainfall should occur once every 100 days , but last year it happened every 70 days , or almost once every two months			0
the top five wettest years since records began in 1910 are 2000 , 2012 , 1954 , 2008 and 2002 – meaning four of the five have occurred since the beginning of this century			1
professor @entity31 , chief scientist at the @entity32 , said : ‘ the trend towards more extreme rainfall events is one we are seeing around the world , in countries such as @entity38 and @entity39 , and now potentially here in the @entity16			2
‘ it ’s essential we look at how this may affect rainfall patterns over the next decade and beyond , so we can advise on the frequency of extreme weather in the future and the potential for more surface and river flooding			0
’ annual rainfall increased by 5 per cent in the 30 - year period between 1981 - 2010 when compared to 1961 - 1990			0
but last year alone , the average rainfall was up 15 per cent			0
increasingly wet : heavy downpours , resulting in scenes like this in @entity56 , have become more common in the past 13 years blame the climate change : increased sea - surface temperatures and melting ice bergs in the @entity60 could be behind the wet weather @entity63 's fault : although it is easy to blame climate change some experts say extreme weather is merely a result of natural variation figures released by the @entity32 show last year ’s total rainfall was 52½ inches across @entity16 , just a quarter of an inch less than the wettest ever year , 2000			1
broken down into the countries that make up the @entity16 , @entity73 experienced its wettest year since records began with just over 44 inches , an inch more than in 2000			1
@entity77 saw its third wettest year in 2012 , and it was @entity80 ’s 17th			2
@entity32 forecasters said changes in sea surface temperatures and reducing amounts of @entity60 sea - ice could be influencing the increase in rainfall			1
another theory is that the @entity90 increase in global temperatures since pre-industrial times is causing the wet weather because a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture , leading to the greater risk of heavy rain			2
soon less weird : sights such as this , two people canoeing through @entity99 , @entity80 in november last year , could become increasingly common if forecasters are to be believed @entity32 forecaster @entity103 said : ‘ at the moment , we do not have a definitive answer to why @entity16 has had so many wet years since 2000			1
it could be down to natural variation or it could be other factors , including potential increases in global temperatures			0
’ professor @entity111 of @entity112 said we are likely to see more flooding in the future			0
he said : ‘ rainfall has increased in recent decades over many parts of the @entity118 and we ’re seeing rain falling in heavier bursts			0
2012 for the @entity16 fits with that picture and we ’ve seen the effect of all this rain with disruptive flooding across many parts of the country			2
’ with four of the five wettest years on record occurring since 2000 , many were quick to blame climate change for the increased rainfall			1
@entity131 than ever : @entity73 experienced it 's wettest year since records began in 2012 but some experts suggested it was just a result of natural variation , with a similar pattern of wet weather also occurring in the 1950s			1
@entity16 ’s third highest annual rainfall was recorded in 1954 , while two other years in the decade are amongst the 20 wettest			1
one theory is that in both the 1950s and the past decade warmer than usual sea surface temperatures in the @entity142 altered the jet stream , causing wet weather to remain over @entity16 for longer periods of time			1
two men were taken to hospital with head injuries yesterday after falling into a flooded river when a footbridge collapsed			0
the pair , aged 65 and 55 , were pulled from the @entity152 at @entity153 near @entity154 on the @entity155			0
they were believed to have been part of a shooting party .			0

four out of five of the @entity16 's wettest years have occurred since 2000
rising temperatures and melting @entity60 ice could be to blame
