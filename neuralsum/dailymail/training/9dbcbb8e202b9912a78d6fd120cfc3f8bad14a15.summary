leader : this is billionaire financier , @entity1 and his wife @entity2 is the @entity4 or chief of @entity6 , a secret society for elite @entity8 bankers a journalist who gate - crashed a secret fraternity of billionaire bankers has laid bare the booze fueled , cross dressing antics of its members as they openly mocked the 99 percent and made light of the enormous government bailouts of 2009			1
sneaking into the swanky @entity20 ballroom in january 2012 , where he was assumed to be a waiter , @entity18 became the first outsider to witness the @entity26 - @entity25 induction ceremony for @entity6			1
new members , known as neophytes , traipsed around other masters of the universe dressed in leotards and gold - sequined skirts and wigs - to then perform vaudeville - style acts that included homophobic and sexist jokes and even a parody of @entity39 's ' dancing queen ' , called ' @entity40 '			1
over 200 multi-millionaire and billionaire bankers and financiers were in attendance at the annual event so chock - full of power and money that @entity18 felt that ' if you had dropped a bomb on the roof , global finance as we know it might have ceased to exist '			1
older hands at the fraternity , which has existed since the end of the @entity56 , walk around the well - lubricated dinner wearing ' purple velvet moccasins embroidered with the fraternity ’s @entity60 letters '			2
lavish : this is the ballroom of the @entity63			2
@entity20 in @entity64 - where @entity6 met in january 2012 and were infiltrated by reporter @entity18 served up a luxury meal of lamb and foie gras , executives from ' nearly every too - big - to - fail bank , private equity megafirm , and major hedge fund ' were in attendance at the prestigious and secretive event			1
each new member , who has to cross-dress at the start of the evening , is required to perform for the benefit of the other guests in their costume wigs - believing they are safe under the mantra of ' what happens in the @entity82 , stays in the @entity82			2
' written up for a piece in @entity84 , @entity18 describes how @entity85 , @entity86 , who works with @entity87 performed a skit with @entity89 , who works with @entity89			2
@entity18 heard them reel off a particularly unfunny joke about a former first lady : ' q : ' what ’s the biggest difference between @entity97 and a catfish ? ' a : ' one has whiskers and stinks , and the other is a fish ' the rich pair even threw in a homophobic jibe for good measure : ' q : ' what ’s the biggest difference between @entity108 and a @entity109 ? ' a : ' @entity108 comes in different - size buns ' some of the performances seemed to skirt the edge of taste , as @entity114 , an investment banking ceo , went on stage in a @entity117 flag hat and sang a song referencing the financial crisis , to the tune of ' @entity121 '			1
club : former @entity84 mayor @entity123 is listed as a member of @entity6 - although @entity18 did not witness him at the january 2012 induction of new members the lyrics included , ' in @entity8 land we ’ll take our stand , said @entity131 and @entity132			1
but first we better get some loans , so quick , get to the @entity134 , man			2
' @entity1 : @entity4 - @entity137 investor estimated by @entity138 in 2011 to be worth $ 1.9 billion @entity139 : grand swipe from 2003 - 2004 - president and ceo of the municipal bond franchise @entity144 @entity145 : grand swipe from 1999 - 200 : businessman and philanthropist with a net worth estimated by @entity138 at around $ 2.3 billion @entity123 : former mayor of @entity151 and business magnate worth who is the 13th richest man in the world with a fortune of $ 31 billion @entity156 : chairman and chief executive officer of @entity158 - the largest money - management firm in the world with assets of $ 3.5 trillion @entity162 : the founder of @entity162 estimated to have a net worth of usd 3.6 billion another two financiers , @entity166 , who is an executive at the @entity167 and @entity168 , who is a hedge fund manager with @entity169 and former assistant secretary of the treasury did a two man comedy sketch			2
in it , @entity166 played the role of a liberal radical while @entity168 played the part of a wealthy baron			2
@entity18 said that it looked like a debate between the 99 percent and the 1 percent			2
at one point , @entity168 said , ' @entity181 , look at you ! you 're pathetic , you liberal ! you need a bath ! ' to which @entity168 shouted , ' my @entity185 , you callow , insensitive @entity187 ! do n't you know what we need to do ? we need to create jobs			0
' past and current neophytes include former @entity84 mayor @entity123 and members of the wealthy @entity196 family			1
the fraternity was started in 1929 by ' four c + @entity201 students ' and its crest is described as depicting a ' macho right hand in a proper @entity204 suit and a @entity206 and @entity207 shirtsleeve			1
' the clandestine groups motto is ' @entity209 ' , or @entity210 for ' while we live , we eat and drink			0
' the current head of @entity6 , or @entity4 , is @entity1 , 76 , known for restructuring failed companies in hard industries and who is conservatively estimated to be worth $ 1.9 billion			1
other members include @entity219 ceo @entity218 , @entity220 , the former chairman of @entity221 and president @entity223 donor @entity222			1
@entity18 describes that membership is not just for the successful in banking			0
there are also wildly unsuccessful members such as former @entity229 ceo @entity228 and former @entity221 ceo @entity230			1
exalted company : @entity232 , former @entity221 chairman and ceo in 2008 - was still attending @entity6 , a secret society for elite @entity8 financiers in 2012 as was @entity222 - who has donated to president @entity223 describing the consummate ease with which he entered the party , @entity18 details how he witnessed @entity1 induct 21 new members in january 2012			1
' good evening , @entity240 , former @entity241 , @entity241 - in - waiting , fellow @entity242 , @entity243 from the @entity245 and @entity246 chapters , and worthless neophytes ! ' @entity1 exclaimed at the beginning of his introductory remarks			0
the first outside to infiltrate @entity6 in its eight decade life - span , @entity18 calls the fraternity so exclusive it is akin to a one - percenter 's club			1
sneaking in as part of his research for his book , ' @entity255 ' , @entity18 was interested to see why so many eager young men work ridiculously long hours when they start banking - but seem to have a drastic personality changes as they age and become so successful			0
staying long enough to record skits and speeches given by new inductees and to take a few pictures , @entity18 was exposed when he tried to video a parody version of ' i believe ' , the big number from musical , @entity270 - for which the neophytes had dressed as missionaries			1
indeed , the lyrics were changed to include the line , ' i believe that @entity185 has a plan for all of us			0
i believe my plan involves a seven - figure bonus			0
' busted : @entity280 , ( left ) principal of @entity281 , and co-chief investment officer of the @entity283 caught @entity18 in the act while @entity89 ( right ) told some off - color jokes as he was inducted billionaire investor @entity280 , a former army helicopter pilot , rumbled @entity18 and tried to take his phone off him			1
@entity18 described @entity280 as having the impression of having consumed alcohol that evening			0
the fight attracted the attention of @entity1 and a @entity291 called @entity139 who ran over and escorted @entity18 outside with his pictures and audio recording intact			0
@entity18 alleges that @entity1 tried to bribe him to keep quiet with the lure of exclusive stories , saying , ' i 'll pick up the phone anytime , get you any help you need			0
' ' yeah , the people in this group could be very helpful , ' @entity139 chimed in			0
' if you could just keep their privacy in mind			0
' however , @entity18 was not swayed and printed his story in @entity84 as part of the promotion for his new book			0
he drew the conclusion that ' the upper ranks of finance are composed of people who have completely divorced themselves from reality			0
' no self - aware and socially conscious @entity8 executive would have agreed to be part of a group whose tacit mission is to make light of the financial sector ’s foibles			0
' not when those foibles had resulted in real harm to millions of people in the form of foreclosures , wrecked 401 ( k ) s , and a devastating unemployment crisis			0
