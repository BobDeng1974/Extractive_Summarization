if saturday 's @entity0 had an award for the ' most improved ' presidential hopeful , @entity3 would win hands - down : she was an unknown when she took the stage but became the talk of @entity9 after a speech that included plain - spoken attacks on likely @entity13 nominee @entity12			1
the former @entity15 ceo entered to polite applausebut left to raucous cheers , as the thousand - plus conservatives gathered to hear from big political names on the right identified a woman they can rally behind			1
@entity21 , the former secretary of state , is expected to use her globetrotting experience as a prime qualification for winning the @entity24 – and @entity3 , it turns out , can match her			1
' like @entity12 , i too have travelled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe , ' she said saturday			2
' but unlike her , i have actually accomplished something			0
' ' mrs. @entity12 , flying is an activity – not an accomplishment , ' @entity3 exclaimed to applause			1
having done business in over 80 countries and having served as the chairman of the @entity70 at the @entity71 , i know that @entity72 is a state - sponsor of cyberwarfare and has a strategy to steal our intellectual property			2
' the ' reset button ' episode was one of @entity21 's early embarrassments at the @entity82			1
in 2009 she appeared in @entity84 , @entity85 with @entity87 foreign minister @entity86 and famously presented him with a prop red button labeled ' reset ' in @entity89 and ' peregruzka ' in @entity87			1
' we want to reset our relationship , and so we will do it together , ' she said then			0
but the @entity87 word was misspelled – it should have read ' perezagruzka			2
' instead , a stick - on label used the word meaning ' overcharged			0
' the embarrassing moment is one of many that @entity98 will likely turn into television ads if @entity21 continues to lead the @entity13 field going into 2016			2
@entity3 also jabbed @entity21 over the @entity48 administration 's patience with @entity103 as it resists attempts to dismantle its nuclear program			2
' i know @entity109 , ' she said , using the @entity112 prime minister 's familiar nickname , ' and know that when he warns us , over and over and over again , that @entity103 is a danger to this nation as well as to his own , that we must listen			0
' and in a coup de grace , @entity3 hammered @entity12 for her now infamous meltown moment during january , 2013 testimony before a @entity55 panel about the terror attack in @entity121 , @entity122 four months earlier			1
' reset ' : @entity3 took aim at @entity12 and the ' reset ' button she infamously gave @entity87 foreign minister @entity86 in 2009 does the @entity126 ? instead of reading ' perezagruzka ' – the @entity87 word for ' reset ' – a stick - on label used the word ' peregruzka ' was used , which actually meant ' overcharged ' faced with pre-election national outrage over a coordinated military - stye assault on an @entity135 diplomatic compound and the death of @entity137 to @entity122 @entity138 , the @entity48 administration had blamed his death and three others on a spontaneous protest supposedly inspired by an anti-islam @entity58 video			1
' the fact is , we had four dead @entity135 , ' @entity21 exploded during a @entity146 hearing			0
' was it because of a protest or because of guys out for a walk one night who decide to kill some @entity135 ? what difference , at this point , does it make ? ' @entity3 brought the episode back from her audience 's mental archives			2
' unlike @entity12 i know what difference it makes that our ambassador to @entity122 and three other brave @entity135 were killed in a deliberate terrorist attack on the anniversary of 9/11 , ' she said , ' and that the response of our nation must be more forceful that the arrest of a single individual a year later			2
' the line brought the house down			0
@entity3 is no political neophyte – she ran unsuccessfully against @entity173 @entity13 sen. @entity172 in 2012			1
but outside @entity173 , she did n't sink into @entity135 ' political consciousness			0
that will likely change if her @entity9 ovations are a fair prediction			0
@entity178 , the local @entity98 chairman in @entity179 , @entity34 , told @entity180 that @entity3 could become a breakout star in the early going			1
' people need to take her very seriously , ' he said			0
@entity183 claims @entity82 higher - ups close to then - secretary @entity12 worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents of anything that might make her look bad , before giving them to investigators @entity3 will be back in @entity34 in mid-march to speak at a ' women in politics ' event			1
' i 've seen her on @entity194			0
i 've seen her on @entity196 's show ... she 's great , ' @entity178 said in an interview			0
@entity198 ' does n't just come on and bash the – you know , it 's like , " here 's all the problems " – she actually is offering solutions			1
' ' @entity3 does n't need to come in and give the razzle dazzle , ' @entity178 said			1
' but she had some good one - liners about @entity12			2
and she 's fair game			0
' former @entity207 @entity98 chairman @entity206 was equally impressed , telling the @entity208 that @entity211 , ' whom most people had never heard of , got the best response			1
' ' she came across as a highly intelligent woman and a strong leader as the ex-chief executive of the biggest tech firm in the world			0
she did herself the most good			0
' the @entity219 featured a parade of conservative luminaries including @entity223 sen. @entity222 , former vice presidential nominee @entity224 , @entity226 gov. @entity225 , former @entity223 gov. @entity227 , pediatric neurosurgeon dr. @entity228 and real estate tycoon @entity229 .			0

' mrs. @entity12 , flying is an activity – not an accomplishment , ' @entity3 exclaimed to applause at the @entity0 on saturday
the former @entity15 chief executive is trying to position herself as the top - tier female presidential hopeful on the political right
she bashed the former secretary of state over her infamous ' reset button ' gaffe in @entity87
