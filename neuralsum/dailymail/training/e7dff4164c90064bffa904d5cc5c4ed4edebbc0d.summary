by @entity0 published : 09:34 est , 23 march 2012 updated : 10:38 est , 23 march 2012 apps have become so cheap , fun and useful that they are actually becoming more popular than the internet , say statisticians			1
apps have actually overtaken the @entity6 - the term for sites accessed via web browsers - in terms of the number of minutes users spend per day			1
it 's a huge change for the connected world			1
a new report from @entity17 ’s @entity16 and the imagining the @entity18 at @entity20 's @entity19 says that @entity21 have actually changed the way we use the internet – and recent statistics back this up			2
web killer : there really is an app for just about everything after all , these days , there really is an app for everything , from smartphone downloads to keep you entertained such as @entity35 to apps that find last - minute accommodation deals such as @entity38			1
@entity39 a @entity41 professor and one of the report ’s authors , said : ‘ apps are like cable channels - closed , proprietary , and cleaned - up experiences			2
‘ i do n’t want the world of the @entity6 to end like this			0
but it will , because people ’s expectations have been shaped by companies that view them as consumers			0
' those giant interests will push every button they can - fear , inexperience , passivity , and willingness to be entertained			0
and we ’ll get a cleaned - up world that we can be perfectly billed for			0
’ meanwhile , last june , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 measured apps as being viewed more than the web for the very first time , with 81 minutes on average being spent on an app per day , compared to 74 minutes surfing			2
last december , the gap had grown to 94 minutes on apps compared to 72 minutes on the internet			0
it ’s a startling statistic – and the numbers associated with the app business have been hitting some huge landmarks recently			0
@entity77 ’s @entity76 hit the 10billion download mark in december , boasts 585,000 apps and receives more than one billion downloads a month , while @entity81 ( formerly @entity82 ) is fast catching up with 450,000 apps			1
