click here for all the stats in our brilliant @entity2 , including this graphic of @entity6 's opening goal for @entity7			1
with twenty five seconds left in the oppressive heat of @entity11 , the world 's greatest player finally made his mark on the world 's greatest stage			0
trailing 2 - 1 to @entity17 's @entity16 having played dreadfully once again , @entity15 and @entity7 were facing a @entity19 humiliation to put in the same bracket as @entity21 's			1
but after @entity16 midfielder @entity22 — who had played brilliantly — lost possession in the centre circle in the 95th minute , @entity15 broke down the right to deliver a sensational cross that allowed substitute @entity27 to head powerfully past @entity28 at the far post			1
in an instant @entity16 hearts broke wide open			0
now , instead of going to @entity33 to scrap with @entity34 for top spot on thursday , they know this group is once again wide open			0
@entity7 will have to improve against @entity37 but at least they remain alive			2
goals : @entity71 65 , @entity58 81 booked : @entity71 @entity7 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity60 7 ; @entity86 6.5 , @entity87 6 , @entity88 6 , @entity89 5 ( @entity90 45mins 5 ) ; @entity91 6 , @entity92 5.5 , @entity93 5.5 ( @entity27 68mins 6 ) ; @entity15 6 , @entity94 5 ( @entity95 15mins 5 ) , @entity6 6 subs not used : @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102			1
goals : @entity6 5 , @entity27 90 +5 @entity104 : @entity66 referee : @entity106 ( @entity107 ) * @entity2 ratings by @entity109 when @entity71 and @entity58 scored deserved second - half goals to wipe out an advantage given to @entity7 by @entity6 after just five minutes , there seemed no way back on a night when even @entity15 , for the large part , failed to lift a bunch of rather average players			1
great players only need a few seconds to change things , though , and @entity7 move forwards now knowing that with @entity15 in their team just about anything really is possible			2
given the traumatic nature of their opening defeat by @entity34 , the night could n’t have started any better for @entity7			2
the @entity16 were still finding their feet in the opening moments when their @entity128 defender @entity67 got himself in a muddle as he attempted to clear what was a pretty routine cross from @entity92 on the left			1
when he failed to deal with the threat and presented the ball straight to @entity6 at the far post , the @entity133 winger had time to control it , steady himself and plant the ball high above @entity28 , who had gone to ground early , from only six or seven yards			0
the @entity139 — needing a victory so badly — could hardly believe their luck but it was peculiar how poorly they went on to play for the rest of the half			0
certainly the @entity147 could have equalised and probably should have done			0
stunner : @entity16 midfielder @entity71 unleashes a curling effort to get his country back on level terms helpless : @entity7 goalkeeper @entity60 can only watch as @entity71 ' effort flies into the back of the net jumping for joy : @entity71 leaps into the air to celebrate scoring his first goal of the @entity19 passion : @entity71 screams with delight as his team - mates join him to celebrate making it 1 - 1 @entity7 's @entity15 saw plenty of the ball on the left of midfield , as his heat map below shows - click here for more in our @entity2 right - back @entity66 was finding it easy to get forward and he had a shot blocked after cutting inside soon after @entity6 ’s goal			1
then @entity58 curled a free - kick over before the former @entity174 forward was played in by @entity22 only to see @entity7 keeper @entity60 save with his legs			2
@entity22 , @entity66 and @entity58 were all to threaten again before the half hour from various distances as @entity7 found themselves unable to keep possession for any length of time			1
@entity15 did present @entity6 with a chance with a pass to his right in the 42nd minute only for @entity28 to save the low drive from the edge of the penalty area			1
then @entity28 somehow fumbled another @entity6 shot on to his lefthand post before saving @entity95 ’s follow - up superbly with a scoop of his left hand			0
it was at the other end where the greatest talking point lay , though , as @entity193 came within a whisker of equalising			0
@entity66 was continuing to terrorise @entity7 with his raids down the right and moments after @entity60 saved his cross shot at the near post he raced to the byline again to pull the ball back perfectly in to @entity22 ’s stride			2
the @entity16 midfielder looked certain to score but somehow @entity7 defender @entity87 managed to deflect the close - range shot over the bar with his knee cap			0

moments after @entity15 had broken to slash a shot wildly off target , @entity193 forced a corner and when it was cleared to the edge of the box , @entity6 could only nod the ball in to the path of @entity71 20 yards or so out			1
the @entity230 midfielder took one touch to control it , another to shift it out of his feet and one more to curl a powerful shot into the corner with his right foot			0
it was a superb shot and @entity16 had the parity their football deserved at that point			0
video ronaldo in sensational form on the run : @entity15 powers his way past the @entity16 's @entity71 ( right ) and @entity67 ( left ) challenge : @entity7 midfielder @entity93 ( right ) tackles the @entity16 's @entity66 ( left ) taking a breather : @entity15 was deemed fit to start in @entity11 after struggling with a knee injury this week safe hands : @entity250 goalkeeper @entity28 keeps the score at 1 - 0 with a fine save late in the first half heads up : substitute @entity95 rises highest to connect with the ball after replacing @entity94 briefly @entity7 — aware that their cause was desperate — tried to rally and @entity6 curled a good shot from 18 yards			1
but the plain truth was that @entity16 were better and they broke to take the lead with nine minutes left			0
@entity259 supplied the cross from the right and when @entity7 could n’t clear , @entity22 ’s scuffed effort screwed wide to @entity74 and his cross shot was nudged in by @entity58 with his midriff			2
at this stage it looked all over for @entity7 and @entity15			0
we should have known better to believe that			0
