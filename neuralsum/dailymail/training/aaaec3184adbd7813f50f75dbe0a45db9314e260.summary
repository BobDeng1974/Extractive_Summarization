the world 's oldest tree has been found on a mountain in central @entity3 – and it is still growing			1
the 9,500 - year - old @entity5 @entity4 was discovered by scientists at @entity7 during a 2004 tree census in @entity9 in @entity3			2
the age of the tree was established using carbon - 14 dating at a laboratory in @entity14 , @entity15 after an investigation by the university			0
growing old : the 9,500 - year - old @entity5 @entity4 is believed to be the world 's oldest tree , and grows on a mountain in central @entity3 the tree , named @entity21 , pictured on a less cold day , was found by a team of scientists during a 2004 census it has been able to survive so long thanks to the process of vegetative propagation , which means it is able to effectively clone itself			1
while the visible portion of the 13ft tall tree is relatively new , its root system has been growing for almost ten thousand years			1
the parts of the root system that were sent to the @entity37 dated back nearly 10,000 years , it is possible that other parts are older , locals told @entity40			2
@entity41 and old : the tree 's age was established by a laboratory in @entity15 which analysed parts of the root system spruced up : the trunk and firs are significantly younger than 9,500 years , but the root system has been growing underground since the last ice age ‘ during the ice age sea level was 120 meters lower than today and much of what is now the @entity52 in the waters between @entity54 and @entity5 was at that time forest , ’ professor @entity48 , professor of @entity49 at @entity7 , said			1
' i can imagine that it may be probable that the first firs came from these areas			0
' professor @entity48 has named the tree @entity21 , after his @entity62			0
he says wind and low temperature have seen the tree end up ' like a bonsai tree ' with a lot of firs and a small trunk			0
' big trees can not get as old as this , ' he told @entity40			0
the tree on @entity73 is older than most things we take for granted			0
it took root as humans had just begun to move north into @entity3 and the rest of @entity80 as the last ice age was beginning to end			1
taking root 7,500 years before the birth of @entity84 , @entity3 was still living in the @entity85 ...			2

the fir was discovered on a mountain in *national* park in central @entity3
although the trunk is much younger , root system is at least 9,500 years
the tree took root at the end of the last ice age , but could be older
