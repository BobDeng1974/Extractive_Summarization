in their heyday they might not have won the seal of approval from everybody , but now eight of our prime ministers are being honoured by @entity8 in a new set of stamps			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 – three of the nation ’s most respected politicians – make the list as do @entity18 stalwarts @entity19 and @entity20 , and the youngest ever premier , @entity21 , who took office aged 24 in 1783			1
@entity21 ’s last words when he died in 1806 were said to have been : ‘ oh my country , how i love my country ! ’ seal of approval : @entity8 is launching a new set of stamps with prime ministers from @entity13 to @entity20 men of letters : @entity32 prime minister @entity12 features , as does the @entity18 stalwart @entity19 @entity34 and @entity35 from the 19th century complete the set of 97p and first - class stamps , approved by the @entity38 , to be released in october			1
eyebrows will be raised , however , by some of the omissions			0
for example , @entity42 – @entity11 ’s great foe – was the architect of @entity47 conservatism and confidant of @entity38 @entity49			2
@entity50 was a great social reformer before leading the country to victory in the @entity54 and into the 1920s			0
and , love him or loathe him , @entity56 was in 1997 the youngest prime minister for almost 200 years and , after a decade in @entity57 , became the longest - serving @entity18 premier			2
@entity11 held the office four times in the late 1880s , while @entity34 helped create modern police @entity35 achieved more than just the name of a tea , while @entity21 was just 24 when he took office @entity65 , editor of @entity67 magazine , said : ‘ this is an intriguing selection			0
' some need little introduction , yet figures such as @entity35 , though little known today , played crucial roles in some of @entity74 ’s most important events , such as the @entity75 , which set the country on the path to mass democracy , and the abolition of slavery			0
’ a @entity8 spokesman said the stamps were a historical look at prime ministers who had been ‘ influential in their position ’			1
he added : ‘ as the @entity74 is the one of the oldest parliamentary democracies in the world , it is fitting that we mark eight individuals who have held the role over the centuries			0

@entity21 and @entity19 also feature in new *collection*
but @entity42 , @entity50 and @entity56 do not
@entity8 chose prime ministers who had been ' influential in their position '
