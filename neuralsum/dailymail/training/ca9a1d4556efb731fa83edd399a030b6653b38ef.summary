a soldier who survived the @entity1 against 4,000 @entity2 only to be forgotten on its @entity3 has finally been hailed a war hero – thanks to a 130 - year - old sketch			1
private @entity8 was among the 150 soldiers who fought in the heroic defence of the small @entity12 missionary outpost in 1879 , which was immortalised by the film @entity2 starring @entity15			1
such was the bravery shown by the heavily outnumbered troops that after the battle 11 @entity18 were awarded			0
hero : @entity21 , great grandson of private @entity8 , recognised him in this sketch by @entity23			1
he had fought valiantly in the heroic defence of @entity1 in 1879 however , private @entity8 ’s name was somehow left out of the @entity3 , and for more than 130 years his descendants have tried in vain to have his heroism recognised			1
but they had no proof – until spotting a sketch of a ‘ @entity32 ’ by a @entity34 war artist that was being used to illustrate a competition run by the @entity37			2
the @entity1 had been nominated as one of @entity40 ’s greatest battles , and the image chosen to represent it was a pencil sketch by @entity23 of @entity32			0
private @entity8 ' family was determined he should be recognised as one of the soldiers who took part in the historic battle his great - grandson @entity21 recognised the face instantly and was able to prove to historians that his relative was a long - forgotten war hero			1
the artist had been commissioned by @entity51 to commemorate the battle in her painting @entity54			0
mr @entity21 said : ‘ @entity23 visited the survivors who returned to @entity56 in the autumn of 1879 and she was treated to a re-enactment of the battle			0
‘ she famously used real models who were actually there to paint her war scenes			0
’ each soldier who survived the battle had also been given a @entity66 to commemorate their role			0
private @entity8 ’s @entity66 was handed over to the museum ’s historians as added proof that he had fought at @entity1			1
private @entity8 of @entity73 , 24th ( 2nd @entity74 , has now been reinstated in the battle ’s @entity3			1
a spokesman for the @entity37 said : ‘ when his great - grandson contacted us with irrefutable evidence proving @entity8 ’s presence at the battle and his identity in the museum ’s sketch book , we set the record straight			2
’ @entity86 appears in the bottom left hand side of this picture painted by @entity23 , titled @entity89 of @entity1 @entity21 , @entity91 ' great grandson , said that another @entity8 was at @entity1 but the sketch could not be him because he was killed in battle mr @entity21 , 52 , from @entity94 , said he was incredibly proud of his great - grandfather ’s part in history			2
he added : ‘ it ’s nice that the history books have finally been corrected to recognise his role			0
‘ what i find most inspiring about the battle is that it was won by ordinary men who fought so heroically for one another			0
' how exposed must they have felt , yet they defended the outpost to a man over a nightmarish 12 - hour period			2

@entity8 ' name was left off @entity3 of soldiers who defended tiny outpost
@entity116 *wanted* him to be recognised for his actions and finally have proof
