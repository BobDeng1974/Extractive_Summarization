by @entity0 published : 10:03 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 10:33 est , 16 august 2012 the world 's foremost euthanasia clinic , @entity3 , is to sue the @entity5 police after their officers tried to revive a terminally ill woman who fell asleep during an assisted suicide			1
police stopped the procedure near @entity11 after the patient lost consciousness after only consuming half the drugs meant to kill her , and therefore officers assumed that her suicide attempt had failed			2
the unnamed woman was meant to finish the lethal cocktail of barbiturates and police say their rules state that if a patient is still alive two hours after taking the drugs they will call an ambulance			1
' abduction ' : dignitas claim the woman was illegally taken from their clinic near @entity11 , pictured , and want the @entity5 police prosecuted following the intervention the woman in her 60s , who was suffering from a genetic disease and weighed only five stone , was rushed to hospital were she later died			1
under @entity5 law , a state official - usually a police officer - must be present to monitor proceedings when an assisted suicide is being conducted			2
and @entity3 now want the police to be prosecuted for ' interfering in a legal assisted suicide ' and ' abducting a patient ' during the incident on august 2			1
suicide : patients at the clinic consume a cocktail of barbiturates dissolved in a drink to kill them , pictured at a different assisted suicide , but on this occasion the woman fell asleep before finishing it ' because of the woman 's weight she had already taken enough of the drug to die , ' a @entity3 spokesman said			1
' the police acted in a random and provocative way against the wishes of the woman 's closest family , who were at her bedside the whole time			0
' the woman was first given a drug in a glass of water to prevent vomiting , then 30 minutes later she began drinking a lethal dose of barbiturates dissolved in fruit juice			0
in almost all other cases at @entity3 , the patient finishes the glass then begins to feel drowsy with ten minutes before moving from anaesthetised unconsciousness to coma then dying of respiratory arrest			2
but in this case , the 67 - year - old woman only managed to finish half the glass before she fell asleep , and the lower dose of the fatal drug meant she took longer to die , @entity3 said			0
assisted suicide is legal in @entity5 and the controversial @entity3 clinic has attracted scores of patients from the @entity89 , where helping someone to die is a criminal offence that can lead to a murder charge			1
a minister for the @entity5 government 's public affairs department said today an independent inquiry would be launched into the matter			0
but the police are standing firm and say their actions were the right ones			0
' the suicide procedure had clearly failed because she was not dead after two hours , ' a spokesman for the @entity11 prosecutor 's office			0
' police acted to avert any suffering that might have ensued on the patient 's behalf			0

the woman in her sixties dropped off halfway through taking the lethal cocktail of drugs mixed to kill her
she later died in hospital after she was taken from the clinic by police
the @entity5 authorities claim that if a patient is not dead after two hours they will always call an ambulance
but @entity3 want the police prosecuted for ' abducting a patient ' and ' interfering in a legal suicide '
