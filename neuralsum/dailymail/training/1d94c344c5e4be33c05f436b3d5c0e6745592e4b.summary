by @entity0 published : 20:38 est , 2 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:19 est , 3 december 2013 they gave more than 20 boxes of clothes , bags and shoes to a charity shop in an attempt to raise money for survivors of the @entity13 disaster last month			1
but many of @entity15 and @entity17 ’s donations have ended up in far less honourable hands			0
when the sale opened 11 days ago at a @entity23 @entity22 charity shop in @entity24 , hundreds of fans queued around the block in a bid to get their hands on the famous couple ’s rare designer items			1
however , several shameless shoppers went straight home to sell their bargains online , with some making more than twenty times the sale price in profit			2
a tuxedo jacket that was once owned by @entity37 went up on @entity38 has a minimum £ 300 bid attached @entity40 queued for one and a half hours to get the suit - which @entity37 wore to the @entity42 in 2011 @entity44 student , @entity40 , is one of many who has been criticised for cashing in on the stars ’ good nature			1
he bought @entity15 ’s tailored @entity49 tuxedo for just £ 125 which he has now sold for £ 2,600 on auction website , @entity38			1
the unique item was hand - fitted for football star and worth at least £ 4,000 – but @entity15 had deliberately decided to sell it on for an affordable price so that normal people could afford it			0
the 22 - year - old queued for one and a half hours to get the suit - which @entity37 wore to the @entity61 ’s @entity42 in 2011 , where he was pictured with the @entity63			1
destined for @entity38 : a shopper inspects a pair of @entity67 shoes later spotted on the auction website on sale : this pair of @entity67 shoes that once belonged to @entity17 are already listed on @entity38 he claims he originally bought the @entity73 tuxedo for his father @entity74 ’s 53rd birthday , but when he got it home he realised his father would be ‘ too fat ’ for it			1
so he decided he would sell it on , keeping three quarters of the profit – for a day out with his father and to put towards paying off his student loan			0
the rest , he said , he will give to charity			0
but the @entity86 student has received abuse through social media sites and on @entity38 accusing him of cashing in on a charitable gesture			1
@entity90 , a @entity92 weather presenter , said on @entity93 that if an item does n’t fit , people should ‘ just sell them for what he / she paid ’ – not make a profit			0
but mr @entity40 responded , saying : ‘ it is absolute nonsense			0
if i keep the suit and leave it in my @entity106 ’s wardrobe never to be worn then that is okay , but if i sell it on to a buyer who really wants it that is n’t ? ' choice : the shoes , in a rainbow of colourful shades , line the shelves of the @entity118 @entity22 shop he added : ‘ where is the logic behind that ? it ’s rich of anyone to knock someone else ’s charitable donations			1
@entity90 poses pictures of her exotic holidays in @entity128 on @entity93 – is someone having a go at her for not giving this money to starving children ? no. ’ he said : ‘ from an economics point of view , it makes complete sense			2
‘ it does n’t fit my dad , so we want to sell it to someone who can get value out of it as that ’s better than it being unused			0
‘ this way i can raise more money for charity than i already have by buying the tux and make a profit to do something nice with my dad			2
’ performance : these gold boots included in the sale were first worn for a 2000 @entity155 show at the @entity156 throng : shoppers eager to get their hands on a piece of fashion history scramble to the till at the charity shop battle of the black dress : although it caught the shopper on the left 's eye , the blonde lady took the piece home excited : this @entity37 fan appears utterly overjoyed to be allowed into the shop when it opened at 11am but mr @entity40 is n’t the only one making a profit			1
among other items that have been in online auctions are @entity17 ’s white platform trainers that she wore at the @entity179 game on 7th june 2007			0
despite the new owner paying less than £ 50 for them , bids started at £ 1,000			0
and another @entity38 user is selling a pair of @entity17 ’s @entity186 black heels for £ 330			1
only 150 shoppers were allowed in to the charity shop near @entity190 in @entity24 on november 22 , then it was one - in - one out as men and women lined up for hours waiting for their chance to grab a bargain			0
more than 500 donated items went on sale , incuding designs by @entity67 , @entity198 and @entity199 , which started at just £ 25			2
the couple also donated their famous matching @entity202 outfits worn at the @entity204 in 2006			2
posting photos of her piles of discarded clothes ahead of the giveaway on her @entity93 page , @entity17 wrote : ‘ @entity210 to support @ @entity211 @entity213 clothes for # @entity215 survivors			2
’ @entity17 , who spent the weekend before last sorting through her wardrobe , has been urging others to follow her example and donate their old clothes .			0
