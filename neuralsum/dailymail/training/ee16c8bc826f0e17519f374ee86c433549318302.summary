@entity34 , who documents every trip on her blog @entity147 , takes pictures of her pet at every opportunity			2
from soaking in the bright lights of downtown @entity120 to sipping on a beer in @entity28 , @entity4 , who sometimes has to hide in a specially made bag when passing through ' dog un-friendly ' countries , is a constant on @entity34 's travels			1
she said : ' travelling is so much more fun when it 's with @entity4			2
' many countries are very nice with dogs , but some countries , like @entity32 , just do n't accept them anywhere ; so we have to hide him			2
@entity166 : he looks like he wants time to chill out on the white sand beach and a hammock in @entity32 roll up , roll up ! street vendors in @entity32 were given a run for their money when @entity4 decided to try his hand statesmanlike : he had been told he was too weary to travel			1
but @entity4 looks content sat in @entity112 on top of the world : he 's getting on , but @entity4 ( pictured in @entity122 ) is still raring to go , @entity34 says ' @entity27 is our favourite place , people are in love with dogs there and he can go anywhere he likes			1
