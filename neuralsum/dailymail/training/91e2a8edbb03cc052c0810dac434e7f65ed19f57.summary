in the meantime , the @entity27 had reported the incident to the police and the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , which listed it on its database of stolen antiques , but it did n't unearth any leads			0
it was only earlier this year when she finally realised what had happened after spotting one of the pieces - a @entity42 brooch in a catalogue of @entity45 auction @entity47 ( @entity46 )			0
the find was investigated by @entity32 's lawyer , @entity49 , who discovered that the jewellery had actually resurfaced just months after it was lost and was sold for less than £ 5,000			2
mr @entity49 said : ' apparently , the airport found the jewels or they were turned in to ' lost and found ' by someone ... the question remains : what did they do to help find the owner ? ' they did n't call the police even though the airport police had a record of the theft			1
' they did n't call @entity32			0
the only thing they did was sell them			0
' trying to make amends : the operators of @entity4 has since offered to reimburse the diamond merchant in order for the tiara and brooch to be returned to her , although an emerald ring and pearl earrings are still missing he established the brooch was consigned to @entity46 by someone who bought it in good faith from the diamond merchant			1
@entity0 said : ' i 'm absolutely amazed			2
i thought that after six years i 'd lost them forever			2

so everything was very special			0
' the @entity20 has since offered to reimburse the diamond merchant in order for the tiara and brooch to be returned to her , although an emerald ring and pearl earrings are still missing			1
