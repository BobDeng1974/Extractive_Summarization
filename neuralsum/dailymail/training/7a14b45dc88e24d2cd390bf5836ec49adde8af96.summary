@entity1 president : @entity0 has defended @entity24 ' it 's very subjective			1
we have to follow the regulations but i think it 's an historical moment and a good moment for football			2
' my wish is not to kill the clubs			2
we have fair play to help the clubs have better governance			2
' i 'm not the person who decides ... but i think it would be a big mistake if we banned the clubs because financial fair play is to help them - not to kill them			0

' @entity0 and @entity45 have been exchanging jibes over recent months but the @entity1 president insisted their personal relationship still remained good			1
