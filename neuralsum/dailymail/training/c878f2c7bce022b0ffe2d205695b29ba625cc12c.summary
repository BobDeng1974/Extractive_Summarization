a number of turkeys are likely to be left feeling ‘ unfulfilled ’ tomorrow as stuffing topped the list of items most likely to be forgotten in the @entity7 shop , new research revealed			2
almost half of @entity9 ( 44 per cent ) admit to forgetting at least one @entity7 dinner essential in the mad @entity12 rush			1
stuffing ( 11 per cent ) was followed closely by cranberry sauce ( 10 per cent ) as the most forgotten item			2
while 3 per cent of shoppers have forgotten to purchase the all - essential turkey amazingly , three per cent of those surveyed said they were guilty of forgetting to buy the turkey when doing their @entity7 food shopping , even though they passed by the poultry aisle			1
the survey of 4,000 brits by @entity35 also revealed that 18 - 24 year olds are more than twice as likely to forget to buy a turkey for their @entity7 dinner than stock up on alcohol supplies			1
overall , five per cent will forget to buy alcohol as opposed to the three per cent who admitted forgetting to buy the most important item on the @entity7 menu			2
it also revealed that we are a nation of over-shoppers with almost half of us ( 48 per cent ) having to eat @entity7 leftovers until the @entity50 due to overestimating the shopping			0
but a smug 47 per cent do buy just the right amount of food and drink			0
brits will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners on christmas day , a study by @entity59 revealed on christmas day itself , a study by @entity59 revealed @entity18 households will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners			0
the food we leave on our plates on december 25 adds up to to 263,000 turkeys , 740,000 @entity7 puddings and 17.2 million @entity69 sprouts across the @entity18			1
figures showed that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away , which equates to an incredible £ 64million of wasted food			0
the sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins , leftover carrots would reach from @entity76 to @entity77 when lined up end - to - end and unused gravy would fill an @entity81 - sized swimming pool .			0

almost half of @entity9 will forget at least one @entity7 dinner essential
cranberry sauce , @entity69 sprouts and *cheese* are also *regularly* forgotten
