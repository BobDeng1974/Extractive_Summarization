' this is part of ongoing maintenance and , due to the nature of the work , some closures during weekends will unfortunately be required between @entity12 and @entity14			2
' he went on : ' we will be doing as much of the work as possible overnight ; however , in some cases we need to carry on beyond normal overnight engineering hours and normal weekend services will not be able to operate			0
' i apologise to customers for the disruption			0
we ’ll be keeping the impact to a minimum by spreading the work out and including some later - starting services on sunday mornings to minimise the overall number of closures			0
