@entity0 will attempt to persuade @entity1 to continue his international career until 2016 - leaving the @entity4 captain with a hard choice between the needs of club and country , with @entity9 playing in the @entity11 next season			1
though @entity1 , 34 , has struggled at times at the @entity17 , the value to the squad of his experience means that @entity0 would want him to continue , given that so many youngsters are emerging in the team			0
with @entity21 about to retire from international football , @entity1 is one of the few senior pros left and @entity4 will not want to lose him as he provides a degree of balance to the youthful enthusiasm of the squad			1
@entity1 has said he will make his decision only after speaking to his friends , family and @entity9 manager @entity45 after the @entity17			2
@entity45 ’s views will be important — and it seems likely the @entity9 manager and the club ’s medical staff would prefer @entity1 to use international breaks as rest weeks			0
given @entity0 ’s desire to keep @entity1 , the captain is expected to win his 114th cap in the dead - rubber match against @entity56 on tuesday			2
even though the @entity58 chairman @entity57 has guaranteed @entity0 a job until 2016 despite @entity4 ’s exit , three defeats at the @entity17 would damage the manager ’s credibility further , so it remains a vital game			0
ouch : @entity1 can only watch on as the @entity66 players celebrate @entity34 's decisive goal that defeated @entity4 end of the world : but @entity1 could be back again for another shot at glory with @entity4 at @entity71 given @entity56 ’s wins over @entity66 and @entity73 , @entity0 seems likely to adjust the tactics that have seen @entity4 exposed defensively — losing the game would bring further humiliation			1
if that is the case , @entity4 could revert to a more conservative 4 - 3 - 3 formation with @entity79 and @entity80 ahead of @entity1 , @entity81 up front and @entity83 and @entity84 wide			1
that would give @entity4 more bodies in midfield where they have struggled against both @entity73 and @entity66			0
@entity4 ’s campaign is their worst at a @entity17 finals since 1958 , when they failed to get out of the group , though then they drew all three matches and finished joint second in their group			0
warm embrace : @entity1 has a word in the @entity81 's ear after the goal that levelled proceedings partners : @entity1 has always been @entity0 's first choice captain for the national team youthful : @entity1 on his @entity4 debut - now @entity0 wants him to help the squad 's new youngsters			2

@entity4 manager does *n't* want to lose all of his experienced players
@entity1 will first consider @entity9 's needs before *deciding* on future
@entity21 will retire from international football after the @entity17
@entity0 likely to *switch* to more conservative 4 - 3 - 3 against @entity56
