by @entity0 published : 06:37 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 29 march 2013 it is said that they have more time on their hands than most doctors			1
and one anaesthetist has certainly put his quiet hours to good use			1
@entity8 , an anaesthetist at @entity9 , in east @entity10 , has managed to write a novel while his patients were unconscious			1
bound with @entity14 , a 480 - page love story , follows the tale of a university lecturer who falls for one of his students			1
anaesthetist @entity8 wrote the novel while his patients were unconscious it tracks his downfall as he is eventually found guilty of harassing her			1
that the author , who is a staff grade anaesthetist , according to @entity27 , uses the ‘ acknowledgements ’ page to explain how he had time to write the book , according dr @entity8 writes : ‘ @entity31 and @entity32 kindly paid me to write it while simultaneously giving anaesthetics			1
' many of their tardy surgeons unwittingly helped by making simple operations last for hours			1
’ anaesthetists are required to send patients to sleep and then to monitor their vital signs while the operation is being carried out			2
however , they are reputed to have more time on their hands than the surgeons themselves			1
consequently , many are said to be very well read and excel in puzzles such as @entity49			2
the anaesthetist says it was possible to write the book because ' tardy surgeons ' made ' simple operations last for hours ' ( posed by model ) on the first page of dr @entity8 ’ novel , which is self - published and for sale for £ 10 , he writes : ‘ she wore a plain black skirt , a white blouse with a slightly lacy collar and an open pale blue cardigan with its sleeves pulled back a little			1
‘ although her behaviour was not forward , i sensed in her unstilted conduct some wish to engage with me			2
‘ her navy nylon jacket slid off her shoulder - bag onto the cold flag - stones			2
we both stooped to pick it up and our heads almost collided			2
’ the novel , which is described on @entity76 as exposing ' the modern ropes of duplicity and fake virtue ' is currently placed at 370,777 in the best - seller ranking			0
on a grey blustery december afternoon , i sat marking essays in my study in @entity84			0
it was dull stuff and gradually , as twilight fell , recurrent distractions stole into my thoughts			0
for instance , out of the blue i found myself puzzling over girls who had tried to dominate me and who – had i allowed it – would then have despised me			0
i sipped tea from a patterned blue and lilac glazed mug , twirled round and stared out through the long floor - length window			0
@entity100 had engulfed the roof - tops of the town , but down in @entity103 , where some cast - iron street lamps flickered , i glimpsed @entity105 strutting home , perhaps in an irritable mood			0
back in the spring i had taken her out , not out of love but out of emotional loneliness or lust , for if sullen and sour she had a sexy inciting shape			1
@entity105 was the secretary in the @entity112 and at twenty - nine , three years older than myself			0
beneath her loosely gathered dark hair and her glinting thick - length belted black leather jacket , i could dimly make out the hem of her pleated tartan skirt , her black tights and her glistening black high - heeled leather boots			0
again the paradox had been that despite bullying me , deep down she had wanted to be mastered			0
i watched her provocative hour - glass outline swaying along beside a set of iron railings until it receded through a soot - blackened archway .			0
