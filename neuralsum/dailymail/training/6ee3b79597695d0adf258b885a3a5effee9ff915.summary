by @entity0 @entity1 has been convicted of murder after driving his lorry over the head of a grandfather following a road - rage row in february a lorry driver was today jailed for life for murdering a grandfather - of - four by deliberately driving his 17 - ton lorry over him following a petty row			1
@entity1 drove the lorry over the head of @entity13 , 56 , after mr @entity13 stood in front of the vehicle when the pair clashed on the @entity17 near @entity18 in february			1
the 46 - year - old was convicted of murder after a jury at @entity22 was shown ' dash - cam ' footage of a road - rage attack carried out just months earlier by @entity1 , who the court heard was a ' coward ' but became a ' big man ' and a ' bully ' behind the wheel of his truck			1
sentencing @entity1 to minimum 15 years today , judge mr justice @entity33 said : ' you drove forward knowing full - well he was still out of the vehicle			1
' as you were driving forward he waved his arms in front of him or upwards for you to stop but you did not or even after it occurred , driving forward some distance			0
' you said if he was in front of you , you would have seen him			0
well he was and you did see him			0
' although the intention was formed suddenly , the fact remains you were behind the wheel of a 17 - ton vehicle which was familiar to you			0
once the red mist descended all reason and restraint was lost			0
' the sentencing came after damning evidence showed the lorry driver from @entity53 laughing and jumping up and down as he punched and kicked the car of another motorist in a previous incident			2
two months after that , @entity1 and mr @entity13 became involved in a row while both driving along the @entity17 on the outskirts of @entity18 , @entity60 around 8am on february 15 this year			1
both drivers had come to a halt on the single carriageway road with mr @entity13 getting out of his van and standing in front of the lorry with his arms outstretched			2
it would have been ' obvious ' to @entity1 that mr @entity13 , a ' well - nourished ' man of 16 stones and wearing a high - viz jacket , was in front of him , the court heard			1
forensic examination showed the victim was dragged underneath the vehicle with his head in the area of the front driver ’s - side wheel			1
a roadside witness shouted at @entity1 : ' you ’ve f * * * * * * killed him ! ' after running over his victim , @entity1 stopped a short distance up the road and spoke to @entity84 , who stopped his own car to dial 999			2
@entity1 claimed mr @entity13 had been ' throwing things ' at his lorry and it ' all started down at the lights , ' the court heard			1
@entity13 's family believe he may have been killed by @entity1 after trying to stop the truck driver from talking on his mobile phone while driving along the @entity17 near @entity18 , @entity60 @entity1 said they were involved in an ' over-taking session ' and claimed mr @entity13 had thrown coins at the window of his cab			1
the court heard that as mr @entity13 lay dead in the road , @entity1 calmly told a 999 operator : " @entity102 love - there 's a man seriously injured '			1
the taco - graph tracking the lorry ’s movements before the fatal incident showed @entity1 pulling emergency brakes and ' flooring ' the vehicle to its maximum 54mph - exceeding the road ’s 40mph limit			2
after mr @entity13 ’s death , his family said : ' @entity13 was an amazing , caring dad , granddad , brother , uncle , son and friend to many			1
' his smile and charm made the room light up when he walked in			0
loved by all who knew him , he is irreplaceable and will be very sadly missed			0
' the jury heard of two earlier road rage incidents , one caught on camera , involving other motorists and the defendant , before mr @entity13 was killed			1
one motorist described @entity1 as like a ' raging bull ' threatening , ' i will f * * * * * * kill you ! ' after an incident on the @entity136 in january last year , while another , @entity138 , 24 , who recorded the incident on his ' dash cam ' described the defendant as ' animal like ' and a ' predator '			2
footage from a dashboard camera showed ' animal ' @entity1 kicking a car in a previous incident of road rage mr @entity138 told the jury an ' angry ' @entity1 , ' looked like he wanted me dead ' , during the incident on december 17 last year in @entity53			1
the footage showed @entity1 getting out of his lorry cab on two occasions , running at the @entity155 and kicking and punching the vehicle while trying to get the driver ’s door open			2
mr @entity138 told the jury : ' i do n’t know how someone can react so violently to a situation			2
it would be like an animal hunt			0
it looked like he wanted me and he wanted me dead			0
' after viewing the footage , @entity164 , prosecuting , put it to @entity1 in the witness box : ' i ’m suggesting what we saw there is you losing it with another road user , you have lost your temper and you have got a very short temper , a short fuse ? ' and like the coward that you are , a big man behind the wheel and you become a bully in that lorry and that ’s precisely what you were doing on that morning on the @entity17 ? ' @entity1 tried to claim he had n't seen mr @entity13 in the road but the jury convicted him of murder the defendant responded : ' no. ' @entity1 told the jury while he accepted he drove over mr @entity187 and caused his death , he said he simply did not see the victim standing in front of his vehicle			1
but he was convicted by the jury following three and a half hour deliberations at the end of a week long trial			2
@entity1 made no reaction when he was found guilty			0
he was remanded into custody and now faces an automatic life sentence			0
many members of mr @entity13 's large family burst into tears in the public gallery as the guilty verdict was delivered			1
@entity203 mr @entity13 , a father - of - three and grandfather of four was himself one of 13 children originally from the @entity207 area of @entity208			1
outside court his eldest sister @entity209 , 62 , from @entity207 said of her brother ’s killer : ' i hope he rots in hell , i really do			0
we were all praying today for that murder verdict			0
' it has been horrendous listening to it in court			0
it ’s been terrible for the family , a lot ca n’t come to court because of it all			0
' he was a lovely dad , a lovely brother , never caused any trouble , never been in trouble			0
he was actually a truck driver himself and he taught people himself how to drive @entity225			0
' mrs @entity209 said her family believed her brother may have spotted @entity1 using his phone while driving shortly before the incident , which the defendant admitted			1
mr @entity13 ’s family believe that , as a lorry driving instructor , he may have indicated to @entity1 to get off the phone - sparking the fatal confrontation			1
in a statement , released after the verdict , mr @entity13 ’s daughter , @entity235 said : ' after a very distressing and emotional trial , justice has finally been done for my dad			2
' i am very pleased that such a dangerous man has been convicted and is no longer a danger to other people			0
' i would n’t wish this to happen to another family because it ’s destroyed ours more than anyone could ever imagine			0
