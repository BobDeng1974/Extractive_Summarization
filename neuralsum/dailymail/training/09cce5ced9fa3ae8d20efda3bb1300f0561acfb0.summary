by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:11 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 17:28 est , 14 may 2013 @entity2 was last night forced to deny he was panicking over @entity3 as he unveiled the question that will be posed in a referendum on @entity7 ’s future membership of the @entity8			1
the conservatives published draft legislation pledging a straightforward vote on the question : ‘ do you think that the @entity7 should remain a member of the @entity8 ? ’ it said the referendum would take place by december 31 , 2017 – by which point mr @entity2 says he will have attempted to negotiate a looser , trade - based relationship with @entity20 if he remains in @entity21			1
@entity2 , left , has been forced to deny he is panicking over @entity3 following days of bickering in the @entity9 party over @entity3 in the wake of the election success of @entity26 , led by @entity27 , right the prime minister , on a visit to the @entity29 , said only the @entity9 wanted to give people a say and blamed the @entity33 for blocking an immediate government bill			1
instead , the draft legislation will be introduced as a @entity36 by a @entity9 backbencher			0
mr @entity2 ’s attempt to draw a line under days of @entity9 bickering over @entity3 won the support of arch @entity42 , including mps @entity43 and @entity45 and @entity47 mp @entity46			1
but others rejected mr @entity2 ’s olive branch , saying a @entity51 member ’s @entity50 supported by the party leadership was ‘ second best ’ to a government @entity50 with time set aside in the @entity54			1
former cabinet minister @entity56 , meanwhile , demanded an immediate ‘ mandate referendum ’ , giving the prime minister more authority to go to @entity20 and demand the repatriation of key powers , before the in / out one			1
the pm wants to negotiate a looser , trade - based relationship with @entity20 before a promised referendum @entity2 has won over @entity42 such as @entity45 , left , but @entity56 , right , demanded an immediate ' mandate referendum ' @entity9 mps are still expected to press ahead with a vote tonight expressing regret that last week ’s @entity69 , setting out the government ’s legislative programme for the year ahead , did not include an @entity8 referendum @entity50			1
mr @entity2 insisted he was ‘ profoundly relaxed ’ about how conservative mps voted on the amendment , saying anything that underlined the commitment he made to a referendum earlier this year was welcome			1
asked in @entity78 whether he had panicked in the face of pressure from his mps , he said : ‘ not at all			0
if this was a @entity9 - only government , we would just get on and legislate			0
we ca n’t do that because we are in coalition			0
but i have always said that anything we can do to strengthen , add credibility to the pledge ... we should do			0
’ mr @entity2 insisted he was leading the debate on @entity3 rather than being dragged along by his party			1
‘ the whole reason we are now having this debate is because of the act of leadership i gave , ’ he said			0
‘ when the dust has settled people will be able to see that there is one party , the @entity9 , offering that in / out referendum and two other mainstream parties , the @entity33 and @entity99 , who oppose an in / out referendum			0
‘ it is in the national interest to change @entity3 and change the relationship with @entity3			1
’ he conceded that some @entity106 wanted to have a referendum immediately , but added : ‘ that ’s not my view			2
’ senior @entity9 sources said an initial assessment of the numbers suggested it was ‘ feasible ’ that a backbench @entity50 on the issue could win a vote in the @entity54 , depending on the number of @entity99 rebels			0
the six - clause @entity50 was drawn up by solicitor general @entity117 , with input from justice secretary @entity119 , one of the staunchest eurosceptics in the @entity121			0
pro-europe @entity9 @entity122 said it would be a political and economic ' catastrophe ' to leave the @entity8 @entity9 chairman @entity125 said that the publication of the draft @entity50 would force other parties to tell voters whether they will offer a referendum			2
@entity9 mp mr @entity43 said : ‘ i feel i can now say “ yes , thanks , prime minister			0
on matters @entity3 , that ’s what i wanted ”			2
’ @entity135 mr @entity46 said : ‘ @entity2 has done what @entity42 wanted			2
’ @entity122 , one of the few pro-europeans in the @entity121 , said : ‘ i think we should move on now			0
the important thing is to make sure we get the right result from any referendum which is held to avoid the catastrophe for the country ’s economy and our political standing in the world if we were to be so very , very reckless as to leave the @entity8			2

@entity2 revealed referendum question : ' do you think that the @entity7 should remain a member of the @entity8 ? '
