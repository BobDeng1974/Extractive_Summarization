if @entity1 is doing some backseat driving at @entity3 then it must have been a ride of @entity6 comfort so far			1
this introduction could hardly have gone better , with @entity8 easing through the gears and making the last 16 , and the sanctuary of the middle weekend , for the loss of just 19 games in three matches			1
faced with the in - form opposition of world no 23 @entity16 last night he responded by putting on an exhibition of sublime grass - court tennis to win 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 in just an hour and 35 minutes			1
the excellence of @entity8 rendered this a mismatch , with the only glitch en route to a fourth - round match against @entity48 giant @entity28 the loss of two service games			1
@entity8 has talked about the need for energy conservation ahead of greater challenges , and so far he has only been out there for five hours and 12 minutes			2
were it not for the odd scratchy game towards the end , when @entity16 began to hit freely , this would have been even briefer than his second - round romp past @entity60			1
this match coincided with his brother playing ( and winning ) in the doubles , and @entity8 feigned indignation afterwards that his family had opted to watch @entity66			2
‘ i ’m obviously the @entity68 son , he is the priority			0
my brother is obviously more important than me , that ’s why i ’m so competitive , ’ he said			0
famous face : television funnyman @entity72 was among @entity8 's supporters on @entity75 watching brief : @entity8 's girlfriend @entity76 was on hand to see the @entity79 no 1 sail through overwhelmed : @entity16 had no answer to the reigning champion @entity8 then added more seriously : ‘ it was a step up today and i thought i responded well			1
it ’s been a good week and now i can rest up and be fresh for monday			0
i had enough long matches in the @entity86 to get me physically ready			0
’ @entity8 stressed last week that it would be too early for anyone to blame @entity1 if anything went wrong in the opening rounds , so by the same token it may be premature to give her too much credit			2
yet beyond doubt is that her charge has been spot - on so far in negotiating his title defence , and her presence appears to have been just as calming as @entity99 ’s ever was at this stage			2
20 - @entity101 finally reached the fourth round of a @entity103 at his 20th attempt			0
5 - @entity105 played on each of the first five days			0
6.3m - @entity107 has more @entity109 followers than any other player			0
@entity111 - set defeat for @entity113 and @entity114 in doubles			0
21 - @entity116 clinched his 21st consecutive @entity103 4th round appearance			0
27 - @entity118 made the last 16 for the first time at the age of 27			2
42 - @entity121 broke @entity123 ’s record for most five - setters played in @entity103			0
7 - seventeen - year - old @entity125 is the first @entity126 woman to reach the third round			2
it is hard to recall in @entity8 this week a single moment of the destructive exasperation that can sometimes creep in			2
stiffer tests are sure to come , starting with 6ft 8in @entity28 who , as @entity8 observed , is currently playing the best tennis of his career to push his ranking up to no 18			1
he can cause anyone problems with his huge serve and heavy hitting , but generally the 27 - year - old @entity136 copes well with very tall opponents , as his return is one of the best in the game and he can exploit their more awkward movement and keep them off balance in the rallies			1
the @entity48 ’s serve will definitely be more potent than that of @entity16 , who has battled his way up from obscurity and an almost non-existent junior career through the typical @entity149 tennis value of sheer hard work			0
here we go : @entity8 salutes the crowd after giving the @entity79 fans more reasons to cheer on friday he came in here with some very decent form , having beaten excellent grass - courters such as @entity158 and @entity159 en route to the @entity162 title in @entity163 last week			1
that put him on an unlikely seven - match grass - court winning streak for a man who has only played one @entity3 before , when he reached the second round last year			1
@entity8 had walked out at what is a familiar time for him , early evening , his first at this hour during the 2014 campaign due to his defending champion status on monday and @entity174 clashes on wednesday			1
@entity16 , with whom he trained during the clay - court season in @entity34 , started with admirable assurance by claiming the first six points of the match before a @entity8 ace stemmed the flow			1
so far , so good : @entity8 's coach @entity1 kept tabs on her new charge on @entity75 no worries : @entity8 has won nine sets without dropping one after an impressive first week for the @entity136 for a @entity30 he hits the ball remarkably flat — partly explaining his recent success on grass — but then @entity8 switched to softballing him to draw some mistakes before finding an almost perfect blend of defence and attack			1
he was flying by the time he reached 5 - 2 in the second set and had three set points , only to waste them and then , by way of self - punishment , drop his serve for the first time in the tournament the next game			1
he then rattled off the next five games in exhibition style before one other poor service game interrupted his march to the last 16			0
@entity8 looks extremely sharp and his has been the most convincing passage thus far with only @entity207 , still in the third round , having looked similarly at ease			0
30 - @entity212 seed @entity210 was sent packing by @entity214 ’s @entity213			0
he must be taking inspiration from his country ’s football team .			0

@entity8 wasted little time in *dispensing* with @entity16 on @entity75
last year 's champion won 6 - 2 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2
the @entity136 has *enjoyed* a serene start to his @entity3 defence
he now takes on @entity28 on monday
