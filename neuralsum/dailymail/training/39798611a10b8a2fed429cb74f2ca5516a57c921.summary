by @entity0 @entity1 : 20:57 est , 18 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:36 est , 19 december 2013 flaw : scientists have found a piece of @entity6 which puts men more at risk of heart attack a heart attack gene has been discovered by scientists			1
the flawed dna , found in one in eight men , raises the odds of a patient with heart disease having a heart attack by 38 per cent			0
it also raises the likelihood of them dying in the next six years by the same amount			0
a small number of women – 2 to 3 per cent – are also affected by the rogue dna			0
in future , it might be possible to test heart disease patients for the gene and give them a treatment that will boost their odds of survival			0
@entity34 researcher @entity33 said : ‘ it is almost too good to be true			1
’ dr @entity33 , of @entity36 , in @entity37 , began by showing that people with the genetic flaw produce twice as much of the stress hormone cortisol when put under psychological pressure			1
as cortisol is known to be bad for the cardiac health , he then tracked thousands of heart disease patients for six years			1
this revealed that those with the @entity6 that made them extra-sensitive to stress were also at higher risk of heart attacks , as well as dying from any cause over the course of the study			2
in those with heart disease , having the gene was as damaging as smoking or being obese			2
heart attack genes have been discovered before			0
but dr @entity33 believes his is different because it is known how it raises the odds of problems			1
plus , it should be possible to treat its effects			0
for instance , if further research confirms the findings , heart disease patients could be given drugs that lower cortisol production , the journal @entity74 reports			2
hope : the research raises the prospect that heart disease risks could be combated in those with the faulty gene lead author @entity79 , said : ‘ the exciting part to me is that is genetic trait occurs in a significant proportion of people with heart disease			1
‘ if we can replicate this and build on it , we might be able to find ways to reduce the cortisol reaction to stress – and reduce deaths from heart attack			2
’ it is also possible that treating still - healthy carriers of the gene would prevent them from ever suffering a heart attack .			0

scientists identified a defective gene in many of those *monitored*
it can lead to extra production of stress hormone cortisol , which can lead to bad cardiac health
the study was led by dr @entity33 of @entity36 in the @entity34
it found that having the faulty gene was as bad as smoking or obesity
