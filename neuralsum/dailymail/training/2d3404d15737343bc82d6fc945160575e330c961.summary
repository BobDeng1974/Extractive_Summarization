@entity0 has hit out at a @entity2 documentary maker for not handing over documents he claims show a famous @entity6 athlete gave suspicious blood samples			1
investigative journalist @entity8 alleged an @entity9 medical commission whistleblower had provided him with a list of 150 athletes who gave suspicious samples between 2006 and 2008 - including a famous @entity6 name - that were not followed up by drugs testers			1
but despite several requests from the sport ’s governing body the @entity9 , @entity8 has not shared his list and @entity0 , who has campaigned against drugs cheats throughout her long career , is angry			1
@entity0 has hit out at @entity23 for not passing the alleged list of 150 athletes on to the @entity9 @entity0 breaks the world marathon record with a time of 2hrs 15mins and 25secs in @entity29 in 2003 ‘ this makes me so mad because he wo n’t give it to the @entity9 , ’ said the marathon world record holder			1
‘ the @entity9 have no idea what he is talking about			0
' they ( the @entity9 ) wo n’t come out and say “ we have nothing , none of our records show any of these people that you ’re talking about ” because no journalist has given them this list			1
’ @entity46 , along with other newspapers , was shown the list by @entity8 in the media centre in @entity49 during the @entity50			2
apart from the red marking against the @entity6 name , there was no other purported evidence detailed or actual blood values listed			0
and this list that has caused such controversy , was n’t printed on official @entity9 paper			2
@entity0 strides out from the start line before her record - breaking feat in @entity29 that day @entity8 said when showing around his list : ' i trust the source of these documents 100 per cent			1

she said : ‘ yes , i get it all the @entity75 does make you angry and it does make you think we have to put a system in place that protects those clean athletes			0

the @entity9 insisted they have yet to see the list and are now consulting their lawyers about whether to take action against @entity23			1
a spokesman said : ' no - one at the @entity9 has seen any list			0
we have repeatedly asked to see this list so that we are able to verify if this is , indeed an @entity9 list at all and also to date it properly , because we did not consider information on blood data very reliable until 2009 when technology had evolved to the point where we were comfortable about introducing our @entity106			2
‘ since we are now working with @entity107 we will request that @entity107 ask for this list so that it can be independently reviewed by them			0
we hope that this will help clear up misunderstandings about what this list contains , as well as to allow the @entity9 to demonstrate what actions were , or were not , taken			0
