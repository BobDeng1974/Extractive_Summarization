@entity0 is launching a massive counter-offensive against pound shop stores as it battles to stem the loss of customers to budget outlets			1
the nation ’s biggest retailer has begun opening heavily - promoted ' pound shop ' areas within its stores in a bid to take on thriving @entity12 and other low - cost chains			1
the new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 @entity0 stores , and the retailer plans to increase this figure to nearly 300 over the next few weeks			1
discounts : @entity0 has announced that it is rolling out hundreds of new ' @entity20 ' areas ( file picture ) @entity22 a range of products will be sold for as little as 50p , including items such as health products , kitchen tissues , washing - up liquid , pet food and detergents			1
the @entity0 launch highlights just how severely the success of the pound shops is hitting the profits of established supermarket giants in @entity36			1
in recent years the no - frills budget shops have become a dominant force in @entity40 retailing , with cash - strapped shoppers flocking to them on a regular basis			0
@entity12 was founded in 1990 and has 450 stores countrywide , while @entity45 launched in 2004 and has 200 stores			1
in addition , @entity47 has more than 200 outlets			0
@entity51 buying manager @entity50 said it wanted to ensure shoppers had access to a ‘ vastly improved range ’ of discount products			0
competition : the new zones have so far been introduced to more than 60 @entity0 stores , as it aims to capture shoppers from @entity12 ( pictured ) he said in a letter to suppliers : ‘ this is a project that @entity0 is taking very seriously			1
as a new concept , implementation will be absolutely key to success			0
’ mr @entity50 also told trade magazine @entity68 that the retailer would launch new point - of - sale marketing materials including header boards , hanging banners and other signs to encourage people to visit the new areas of the shops			1
the magazine added that @entity0 has previously attempted to take on pound shops			1
a ‘ pound shop ’ strategy for food and non-food items was implemented in 2009 , with an aisle in larger stores just for the lines			1
a £ 1 section was then rolled in about 50 stores in 2012			0
but one supplier told the grocer : ‘ @entity0 are chasing their own shadow at the moment and this could just end with them just creating even more redundant space			2
‘ and @entity96 from @entity98 analysts said : ‘ @entity0 had to do something about the likes of @entity12 but i think shoppers would rather find deals through the normal course of their shop than go down a couple of separate aisles			1
’ @entity108 ’s sales growth has accelerated to 34 per cent a year , while takings through the tills at @entity111 are rising by an impressive 17 per cent			0
the budget chains have made a concerted effort to target middle @entity36 shoppers who have seen prices rise faster than incomes for the last five years			0
they have become known for produce , cheap dairy products and top @entity121 food and wine			0
current @entity36 market share of the major supermarkets shows @entity0 is still dominant but cheaper options are on the rise @entity108 and @entity111 are targeting people with everything from fresh @entity130 fillet steaks at £ 5 each to award winning wine , coffee and cheese			2
and own - label tablets from @entity111 and @entity108 came second and third respectively in recent tests for the best dishwasher tablets by consumer watchdog which ? – and they were among the cheapest at 10p per wash			0
but while the @entity140 chains open shops at the rate of one a week , @entity0 continues to lose sales despite a £ 1billion turnaround plan			2
its sales in the 12 weeks to april were down by 3 per cent on a year ago			0
last month it was revealed that @entity0 's profits had fallen for the second year running as its rivals continue to eat into its market share , which is at a ten - year low			1
@entity36 's biggest supermarket posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to £ 3.3billion in the past 12 months , down from £ 3.45billion a year earlier			0
@entity0 is still by far the biggest @entity40 supermarket with 28.6 per of market share , but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago			2
@entity157 had 17.4 per cent , @entity156 's had 16.5 per cent and @entity158 had 11.1 per cent in the year ending march 30			0
but all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers , with @entity108 's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the past 12 months			0
@entity165 had 5 per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year , and @entity111 also experienced strong growth in a record - breaking month and now accounts for 3.4 per cent of the market			0
there is also a perception that with stores such as @entity165 clearly high - end , and @entity111 and @entity108 clearly low - end , @entity0 is losing out on shoppers because it is sitting in the middle ground			1
meanwhile in january , @entity173 , who founded @entity12 in 1990 , revealed plans for an online store where everything costs £ 1			2
the minimum order value is likely to be £ 23 , and a ' click - and - collect ' system is being considered , which would allow customers to pick up their goods at other stores and shopping centres .			2

@entity0 has introduced areas to 60 stores and wants them in total of 300
detergents , pet food and washing - up liquid on sale for as little as 50p
move marks a *response* to emergence of @entity12 and @entity45
