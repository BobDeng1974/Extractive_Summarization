these are the horrific images that hammer home the very real dangers of crystal meth			2
but they are not the familiar compare - and - contrast images of junkies who have lost their looks			2
instead , they show the huge risks involved with making methamphetamine either at home or on the road			2
the photos , which include a car in flames and an exploded house , have been released as researchers warn of a crude new method of manufacturing meth that poses a risk even to those who stay away from the drug			1
in flames : a car lies on the side or a @entity27 road after an explosion occurred due to a passenger making ' shake - and - bake ' methamphetamine			2
the crude new method of making meth is posing a risk even to those who never smoke the drug charred remains : the accident took place outside @entity39			1
so - called shake - and - bake meth is produced by combining raw , unstable ingredients in a two - litre bottle it is filling hospitals with thousands of uninsured burn patients requiring millions of dollars in advanced treatment - a burden so costly that it is contributing to the closure of some burns units			1
so - called ' shake - and - bake ' meth is produced by combining raw , unstable ingredients in a two - litre bottle			2
but if the person mixing the noxious brew makes the slightest error , such as removing the cap too soon or accidentally perforating the plastic , the concoction can explode , searing flesh and causing permanent disfigurement , blindness or even death			2
a survey of key hospitals in @entity64 's most - active meth states showed that up to a third of patients in some burns units were hurt while making meth , and most were uninsured			1
the average treatment costs $ 6,000 per day , but the average meth patient 's hospital stay costs $ 130,000 - 60 per cent more than other burns patients , according to a study by doctors in @entity75 , @entity76			1
the influx of patients is overwhelming hospitals and becoming a major factor in the closure of some burns wards , according to the @entity83 report			1
highly explosive : firemen tackle a blaze from a shake - and - bake meth lab explosion in @entity87 , @entity88 , in 2010 tell - tale signs : police found these shake - and - bake meth ingredients inside the house in @entity87 at least seven burns units across the @entity64 have shut down over the past six years , partly due to consolidation but also because of the cost of treating uninsured patients , many of whom are connected to methamphetamine			1
@entity101 experts agree that the annual cost to taxpayers is well into the tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars , although it is impossible to determine a more accurate number because so many meth users lie about the cause of their burns			1
larger meth labs have been bursting into flames for years , usually in basements , backyard sheds or other private spaces			2
but those were fires that people could usually escape			2
using the shake - and - bake method , drug - makers typically hold the flammable concoction up close , causing burns from the waist to the face			1
@entity124 of the @entity125 , @entity88 , @entity126 , said : ' you 're holding a flame - thrower in your hands			0
' also known as the ' one - pot ' approach , the method is popular because it uses less pseudoephedrine - a common component in some cold and allergy pills			1
it also yields meth in minutes rather than hours , and is cheaper and easier to conceal			0
meth cooks can carry all the ingredients in a ruck sack and mix them in a bathroom stall or the seat of a car			0
the improvised system first emerged several years ago , partly in response to attempts by many states to limit or forbid over-the - counter access to pseudoephedrine			0
since then , the shake - and - bake recipe has spread to become the method of choice			1
the interior of a home in @entity39 , @entity27 , damaged by a shake - and - bake meth lab explosion last month a danger to neighbours : the damaged exterior of the same home by 2010 , about 80 per cent of labs busted by the federal @entity161 were using shake - and - bake recipes , said @entity163 , a @entity161 agent specialising in meth			0
so instead of a large lab that supplies many users , there are now more people making meth for their personal use			0
the consequences are showing up in emergency rooms and burns wards			1
dr @entity174 , director of the burns unit at @entity177 @entity176 , said : ' from what we see on the medical side , that 's the primary reason the numbers seem to be going up - greater numbers of producers making smaller batches			1
' it is impossible to know precisely how many people are burned while making shake - and - bake meth			0
some avoid medical treatment , and no one keeps exact track of those who go to the hospital			0
but many burns centres in the most active meth - producing states report sharp spikes in the number of patients linked to meth			1
and experts say the trend goes well beyond those facilities			0
in @entity204 , about three - quarters of meth busts now involve shake - and - bake			0
and injuries are rising sharply , mostly because of burns , said @entity208 of the @entity209			1
highly addictive : known as ' ice ' , methamphetamine crystals are smoked through a pipe @entity204 had 89 meth - related injuries during the ten - year period ending in 2009			0
the state has had 70 in the last 23 months , mostly from shake - and - bake labs , ms @entity208 said			0
what 's more , meth - related burns often sear some of the body 's most sensitive areas - the face and hands			1
dr @entity224 , of the burns centre at the @entity226 , said : ' i do n't think a lot of these patients will be able to re-enter society			1
they 'll need rehab therapy , occupational therapy , which is very expensive			0
' researchers at the @entity226 found that people burned while making meth typically have longer hospital stays and more expensive bills than other burn patients - bills that are frequently absorbed by the hospital since a vast majority of the meth - makers lack insurance			0
doctors at @entity245 in @entity75 , @entity76 , performed a five - year study of meth patients in the early 2000s , then a follow - up study in 2009 - 2010			0
their investigation concurred with the @entity226 findings			0
the @entity75 study also found that meth burn victims were more likely to suffer damage to the lungs and windpipe , spent more time on ventilators and needed surgery more often			2
that report also found that only about 10 per cent of meth patients had private insurance coverage , compared with 59 percent of other patients			0
and in many cases , their injuries leave them unable to work .			0

crude manufacturing method is filling hospitals with uninsured burns victims
@entity271 is so costly it is contributing to the closure of @entity64 burns units
