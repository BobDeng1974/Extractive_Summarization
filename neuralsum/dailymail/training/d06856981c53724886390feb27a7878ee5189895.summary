fifteen - month - old @entity5 suffered from cardiomyopathy , a disease that damages the heart			1
she was just nine - months - old when she was fitted with an @entity10 ( implantable cardioverter - defibrillator ) , which gives the heart a shock if it goes into a dangerous rhythm			1
fifteen - month - old @entity5 underwent a heart transplant at @entity16 in april			1
she is pictured with parents @entity17 and @entity19 , and sister @entity20 @entity21 , a disease that damages the heart muscle , meant her left ventricle had a thickened wall , which stopped it working as well as it should			1
@entity5 was admitted to the @entity29 in october 2012 after she collapsed at home			1
after a month in hospital , she was placed on the waiting list for a heart transplant and became the youngest patient in the country to be fitted with an icd			1
following an agonising wait , in early april the @entity5 family received the call they had been waiting desperately for , and @entity5 was taken to @entity16 for the transplant			1
before the call , the family said they had prepared themselves for the worst			0
@entity5 became the youngest heart implant patient in the @entity2 after cardiomyopathy , a disease that damages the heart muscle , meant her left ventricle had a thickened wall , which stopped it working as well as it should @entity5 's father , @entity54 , 40 , said : ‘ the doctors had told us they did n't know what to do next for @entity5			1
‘ it is a horrendous position to be in , but we were never going to give up on her			0
’ during her nine - hour transplant surgery , @entity5 almost bled to death and doctors had to act quickly to stop the bleeding			1
as a result , she ended up with a large blood clot behind her knee			1
she was diagnosed after being admitted to the @entity29 in october 2012 when she collapsed at home			0
she was put on the heart transplant list after a month in hospital her parents faced an agonising wait to discover whether a heart would come up in time to save her life but they prepared themselves for the worst as she became sicker and sicker mr @entity54 said : ‘ they initially said there was no hope for her leg after the transplant			1
we did n't cope very well with it			0
’ his wife , @entity17 , 36 , said : ‘ it just felt like one thing after another and we thought “ what 's next ? " ’ the family said they were ‘ so lucky ’ a plastic surgeon came up and looked at @entity5 's leg and suggested a procedure worth trying			2
the procedures to save her leg were successful and @entity5 now has blood thinning injections to her leg twice a day to help the recovery process			1
in april she underwent a nine - hour operation to give her a new heart but she nearly bled to death during the surgery and developed a blood clot in her leg which nearly resulted in it having to be amputated after a month - and - a - half at @entity16 , the family were delighted to be able to return home last month			1
however , their joy was short - lived as @entity5 was taken to @entity103 at the end of may after suffering difficulty breathing and a high temperature			2
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ they said it would be a short stay while she had oxygen , but it was quite strange being back at @entity103 , as that is where it all began			0
@entity103 saved her life the first day she collapsed			0
‘ the day we left @entity16 , a consultant said to us they were amazed @entity120 had kept her alive because of her complex condition			0
@entity103 is a fantastic hospital and has a brilliant team			0
’ doctors managed to save her leg but she now has to have twice - daily blood thinning injections to help her recovery a few days after she returned home , @entity5 suffered breathing difficulties and developed a high fever which meant she had to be readmitted to hospital but she has now returned home again after being given antibiotics for a chest infection , @entity5 returned home to her family			1
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ apart from the hiccup , life has been so amazing since we have been home but it is exhausting			2
’ after spending nearly half of her life in hospital , @entity5 is now enjoying little things such as seeing the clouds in the sky , feeling the wind in her face and watching the family 's pet cat with fascination			0
mrs @entity5 : ‘ the first time we went out of the hospital after her transplant , it was like the first time she had seen the world			2
@entity5 with her father @entity19 , sister @entity20 , and mother @entity17			0
the family are urging people to sign up to the organ donation register so that others , like @entity5 , are given a chance at life ‘ now we are home , we wo n't take anything for granted , even doing normal things such as doing the housework and food shopping			2
’ the family are very hopeful for @entity5 's new heart , with a recent biopsy showing no signs of rejection			2
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ if we could say anything it would be how much the transplant means to us as a family			2
it is amazing that we can come home and be a family again			0
‘ it would not have happened without that family who donated their child 's organs			0
’ the family said they want to do their best to help raise further awareness about organ donation and will attend a fun run for @entity16 at @entity194 on june 9			0
mrs @entity5 said : ‘ it is such a sensitive subject and is very taboo			0
we are not saying you should sign your child up , we are saying just think about it			0
it is just to make sure people think about it and talk about it as a family			0
