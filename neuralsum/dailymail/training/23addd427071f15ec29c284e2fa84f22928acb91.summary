pharmacists say they have recorded a surge in sales of slimming productions , treatments for premature ejaculation and hair loss solutions as men log on for love in january , sales of treatments for weight problems , hair loss , premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction jumped by 14 per cent compared to december			1
last month , @entity36 also saw an increase in the number of men requesting advice on how they can best get in shape for dating			2
and while gentlemen across @entity7 seem to be looking for love , the keenest are in @entity45 , @entity46 and the @entity47 and @entity48			0
it is , perhaps , no surprise that men are keen to give their appeal a boost as last month dating website @entity55 saw visitors to the site increase by 25 to 30 per cent			2
@entity68 @entity69 , the superintendent pharmacist at @entity36 , said : ‘ we have found a direct link between the rise in men buying these products and wanting to get back out into the dating scene			0
‘ clearly , sales indicate that these four health issues are at the top of men ’s agenda for their “ health mot ” , particularly as they affect confidence and self - esteem , which are important when dating			0
