@entity8 , which has a 8ft wingspan , went missing when it took to the air for an exercise session in blustery conditions in @entity14 on saturday			1
police officers have warned people to keep their pets indoors until it has been found			1
trainer @entity19 , who thinks ten - year - old @entity20 is probably only a few miles away from her home at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity14 , said : ' she 's a very tame bird , you could walk up to her and almost pet her if you wanted to			1
@entity20 the @entity8 , who has an 8 foot wingspan and has gone missing in @entity14 deadly : police have warned pet owners to keep animals in doors while @entity20 is on the loose ' she is a very strong bird but she 's so gentle and relaxed			1
in winter we are a lot quieter and so we let her fly			0
she 's normally only gone for a few hours at a time but we 've not seen @entity20 since saturday now			1
' i think the windy weather has probably blown her off track			0
letting her have a few hours of freedom is very important for her training but it 's not normal for her to be gone so long			1
' she 's a home bird and i imagine she 'll be sitting somewhere waiting for me to come and pick her up			2
' the weather does n't help either			0
it 's rained a lot and so she 's more likely to be taking shelter rather than flying , which means she 'll be harder to spot			2
' she 'll be sitting there watching the world go by wishing she was back home			0
' bird of prey : @entity19 flies his @entity63 's sea eagle @entity20 during an event at @entity65 mr @entity19 , who has trained @entity20 since she was just two years old , said there have been two reported sightings since she went missing			1
' two people have called me claiming they 've seen her in @entity73 but i do n't think they 'll be her , ' he said			0
' the public can get a little excited over these things			0
they said they were fleeting glances so i think it 's more likely that they were herons			2
' you 'd know if you saw @entity20 because she is so huge			1
' @entity20 's trainer says the raptor will be wishing she was safe and at home the majestic predators , which are native to east @entity88 , can go up to two weeks without food so mr @entity19 said he is n't worried			1
' she 'll be very fit and healthy wherever she and she wo n't need food for weeks , ' he added			0
' i just want to get her home			0
' she 's not fitted with a transmitter because she could just rip it off with her beak in seconds so we ca n't track her			2
' she 's used to eating frozen pigeons and rabbits so biting into a transmitter would be a piece of cake			2
' @entity103 has asked anyone who spots the bird to call 101			0
' if this turns up on your bird table you 're going to call the police , ' mr @entity19 added .			0
