convicted : @entity0 , now 35 , spent a decade behind bars for stalking @entity2 ; he was found guilty of killing her roommate a man who became obsessed with a woman on his paintball team and proceeded to stalk her is now on trial for the murder of the woman 's roommate			1
in an unnerving twist , @entity0 fired his court - appointed lawyer so now he is the one questioning @entity15 , the woman who he used to stalk and who was the reason why he spent 10 years behind bars			1
ms @entity2 's former roommate , @entity18 , was killed in october 1996			1
@entity18 was found strangled to death and her five - year - old son @entity20 was stabbed multiple times during the attack but survived and will be testifying later in the trial			0
@entity0 , who is now 35 - years - old , met ms @entity2 when the two were on the same paintball team in @entity26			1
they became close when @entity0 , who was then only a teenager enrolled at @entity27 , began confiding in ms @entity2			1
' i felt like his bigger sister			0
he was reaching out and needing somebody			0
he told me he did n’t have anyone to talk to			0
i was trying to help him , ' she said in court according to the @entity34			0
@entity0 was 12 years her junior and soon after they became friends , their relationship turned more serious			1
while @entity0 is arguing in court that they were on - again - off - again lovers , ms @entity2 has always denied that version of events and said that he began calling her at the home where she lived with her then - 10 - year - old daughter 50 or 100 times a day			1
' he would get extremely irate and say i was the only one he had to talk to and would kill himself if i would not talk to him			0
i told him he needed to seek professional help , ' ms @entity2 said			2
' the more i told him no , the more he was really persistent in talking to me			0
' the @entity48 reports that @entity0 is attempting to brand ms @entity2 a liar since a number of threatening instances that she claims against @entity0 - like when he allegedly threatened to slit her daughter 's throat , tried to run her car off the road , or when he hung bras and underwear on her doorknob her for her to find - were never reported to police			1
' many things may not be on this report , ' she said in court , unable to contain her tears			0
' my intention was to get ( the stalking ) to stop			0
at the time i did n't know it would lead to what it ... what it led to			0
' scene : at the time of her murder , @entity18 lived in the basement apartment of the house on @entity76 ( pictured ) where @entity2 lived in @entity77 , @entity26 , in an effort to cut him off , she and her daughter moved from @entity81 to @entity82 , but that did n't end his unwanted attention			2
' i walked into my apartment and heard my clock radio on			0
in my bedroom was @entity0 ... he was naked and he had a garter belt and garter hose on and was looking at himself in my mirror , ' she said of one such incident			2
shortly after that may 1995 incident , she called the police and he was arrested , though she later dropped the charges after he promised that he would get help			1
months later ms @entity18 , a @entity98 flight attendant who lived in the basement of ms @entity2 's home , was found dead			1
@entity0 was always listed as a possible suspect but at the time there was not enough evidence to charge him with the crime			2
the next year , @entity0 was convicted of stalking ms @entity2 and spent the following 10 years in jail			1
though he was released in 2006 , it was n't until 2009 when dna testing was able to link @entity0 to the @entity18 crime scene when they traced several hairs on the victim 's body to him			1
one of the most intense portions of the trial was the cross examination of ms @entity2 by her convicted stalker			2
at one point , @entity117 reports that @entity0 tried to have the judge label some portion of her testimony as ' inappropriate '			2
' well , you know , it ’s really inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me , and you ’re sitting here asking me questions , and i have to come back with you and answer your questions , that ’s hard for me ! ' she said .			0

@entity0 met @entity15 in 1995 when they were on the same paintball team
he began stalking her and she got a *restraining* order but dropped charges
months later her roommate was murdered and now dna evidence *suggests* his hair was found on the victim 's body
@entity0 has already spent 10 years in jail for stalking @entity2
