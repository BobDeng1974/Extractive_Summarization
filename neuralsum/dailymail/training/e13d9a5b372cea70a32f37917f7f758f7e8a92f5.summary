she said : ' @entity6 's unforgivable killing of @entity15 and @entity14 has ripped a massive hole in our family			2
' to have them taken from us in such cruel circumstances was devastating			0
' the fact that they had been caught and were held by a well - meaning member of the public , but were then taken by @entity6 was heartbreaking			2

her only pet now is @entity15 's pup , @entity70 who is a @entity72 cross ms @entity50 recalled how the dogs , who were microchipped and wore collars , jumped out of her car and ran off , leaving @entity15 's pup , @entity70 behind			0
the 36 year - old hairdresser quickly formed a search party and contacted local residents , including @entity6 whose farm she visited , only to be told he had n't seen the dogs			1
' i was frantic and together with lots of friends and people from @entity87 i organised a search party and we covered about 90 per cent of @entity90 and looked for them well after nightfall without success , ' ms @entity50 said			0
the following morning , the wife of mr @entity33 who had found the dogs , phoned her to let her know her husband had put them on a lead and left them in @entity6 's care			1
ms @entity50 then contacted the police who searched the run - down property in @entity104 and found the dogs ' lifeless bodies under a heap of wood in the barn			1

his crimes have left @entity50 and her four year - old daughter @entity120 who live in nearby @entity121 , distraught			0
' for weeks afterwards , my troubled sleep was plagued with nightmares and dreadful images of what he 'd done to my pets and i constantly faced the thought of them being taken by him , going willingly with him , and then being shot in the head with a bolt gun when they had done nothing wrong			2
' when i called at his farm he said he 'd not seen them			0
i 'm heartbroken to think that as he lied to me my two dogs were lying dead in his barn			1
' what he 'd done instead was tie them up in his barn and shoot them at point blank range with a bolt gun			0
' ms @entity50 said the man who found the dogs in the first place , mr @entity33 , is devastated after leaving them with the evil farmer			2
' i 'm a country type and understand that if my dogs had been worrying sheep , the farmer would be fully within his rights to shoot them , but they had not touched any lambs and were completely innocent			2
' they were killed in cold blood and for no other reason than malice			0
' i take full responsibility for them escaping and running away			0
i feel so guilty , it 's killing me			0
' now i 'm just left with @entity70 , who is @entity15 's pup			0
' animal rights group @entity170 , which is campaigning for bolt guns to be banned , staged a demonstration outside the court and said @entity6 's sentence was too lenient			2
spokesperson @entity175 said : ' it 's disgusting			0
it 's absolutely saying to everyone else out there you can use a bolt gun and you are going to walk free			0
' @entity6 refused to comment after the hearing			2
@entity6 was given the dogs to look after temporarily but instead shot them at point blank range , inflicting slow and painthful deaths upon them			1
