@entity1 fans taunted their @entity3 rivals with a series of chants poking fun at the result of the country 's historic referendum , including one song informing them : ' you 're @entity13 ' til you die '			1
the 5,000 @entity15 supporters who headed to @entity16 for the 3 - 1 @entity1 victory also lampooned outgoing first minister @entity18 , who was in the stands and quit after losing the @entity20 , singing to him : ' we all voted yes '			1
for long periods they also belted out @entity25 and @entity24 over and over again as the @entity15 comfortably beat bitter rivals @entity26 3 - 1 at @entity27 in @entity16			1
in the weeks before september 's independence vote the outcome was on a knife - edge but in the end the no side won a decisive victory , with 55 per cent of the votes - and 85 per cent of the country voted			2
