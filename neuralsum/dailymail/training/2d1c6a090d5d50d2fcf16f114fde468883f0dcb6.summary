millions of healthy @entity0 are about to be given statins needlessly and exposed to debilitating side effects which include muscle pain and diabetes , leading doctors warn			1
they say @entity8 proposals to radically increase the uptake of the drugs are a ‘ public health disaster ’ that will cause harm to many patients			1
the group – which includes cardiologists , and senior gps – is urging the government and the @entity8 drugs watchdog @entity18 to halt the plans			1
they also claim that eight of the 12 - strong panel of experts who are drawing up the guidelines have financial links to drugs firms making statins – which stand to make a profit			1
' disaster ' : millions of healthy @entity0 are about to be given statins needlessly which could lead to a ' public health disaster ' if the @entity8 does not halt the plans , leading doctors warn about seven million patients in @entity0 take statins to lower the cholesterol in their blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes			1
they are predominantly given to over- 65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle			0
but in february , @entity18 – @entity18 – published draft guidance advising @entity49 to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade			2
it claims this could save many lives at a minimum cost to the @entity8 as the drugs cost as little as 10p each			1
experts say this would lead to the drugs being given to between five and ten million additional patients			1
@entity18 will publish its final guidelines next month			0
but the group of doctors say there is no evidence that giving statins to healthy people increases their life expectancy			1
the group wrote to health secretary @entity72 to warn of the consequences of increasing statin prescriptions on the contrary , they point to evidence showing they increased the risk of diabetes in middle - aged women by 48 per cent and cause fatigue and muscle pain			0
the group also accuse @entity18 of looking only at evidence about benefits and possible side effects of statins that have been provided by drugs firms , which could be biased			1
the leading doctors also argue that rather than prescribing statins , the @entity8 should be encouraging patients to lose weight and take more exercise			1
in a letter to health secretary @entity72 and @entity18 , they wrote : ‘ the consequences of not withdrawing this guidance are worrying : harm to many patients over many years , and the loss of public and professional faith in @entity18 as an independent assessor			2
‘ public interests need always to be put before other interests , particularly pharma [ the drugs industry ]			1
’ professor @entity107 , professor of clinical epidemiology at the @entity109 , one of the doctors against the move , said : ‘ the statin recommendations are deeply worrying , condemning all middle - aged adults to lifelong medications of questionable value			2
’ dr @entity117 , a gp and member of the @entity121 sub-committee , who is also a member of the group said : ‘ who knew that millions of people in the @entity0 now suffer from statin deficiency syndrome ? @entity127 statination is a triumph of statistics over common sense			2
‘ treating millions at a cost of billions based on data we are not allowed to see is an example of the corporatisation of medicine and will result in a public health disaster			2
’ and dr @entity138 , director of clinical research at @entity140 in @entity141 , said : ‘ for most people at low risk of cardiovascular disease , a statin will give them diabetes as often as it will prevent a non-fatal heart attack			0
’ in response , professor @entity149 , director of the @entity150 at @entity18 , said : ‘ cardiovascular disease maims and kills people through coronary heart disease , peripheral arterial disease and stroke			0
together , these kill one in three of us			0
our proposals are intended to prevent many lives being destroyed			2
’ concerns have been raised that eight of the 12 - strong panel recommending widespread use of statins have financial links to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture them			2
they include dr @entity169 , chairman of the @entity18 panel and a heart disease specialist at @entity173 and @entity174 in @entity175 , who has ties to six firms , including @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity179 , which sponsored his research into cholesterol - lowering drugs			1
dr @entity183 , a heart specialist at @entity185 of @entity186 and @entity187 , has been paid by drug companies investing in heart drugs to give lectures and sit on advisory boards			0
they include @entity193 , a @entity194 firm which makes statins that has sponsored him to run a clinical trial			0
@entity198 , a specialist heart nurse who also works at @entity186 and @entity187 , was sponsored by statin manufacturers @entity201 for the first year of her job			0
she was also paid by the same firm to attend conferences			0
dr @entity205 , heart specialist at the @entity207 , has been paid by statin makers @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 to sit on advisory boards			0
