@entity0 , the 29 - year - old brain cancer sufferer who legally took her own life three weeks ago , appears in a new video released wednesday calling upon states across the country to introduce new right - to - die laws			1
the footage to mark what would have been @entity11 's 30th birthday shows her impassioned plea for a change in the law on behalf of other terminally ill patients who want to ' die with dignity '			1
@entity11 , who was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given six months to live this spring , grabbed the national spotlight for about a month after publicizing that she and her husband moved to @entity21 from @entity22 so she could use @entity24 's law to end her life with dignity			1

it also features the voices of other terminally ill patients and their family members			0
@entity24 was the first state to allow terminally ill patients to die using lethal medications prescribed by a doctor			0
' i hope for the sake of other @entity54 citizens all these people that i 'm speaking to that i 'll never meet , that i 've never met that this choice be extended to you			2
this right - that we mobilize it , we vocalize it , we start to talk about it , ' @entity11 says to camera			1
' i decided to share my story because i felt this issue of death with dignity is misunderstood			2
i felt very valued by my physicians here , very protected			0
there 's no way i could have possibly been coerced into this			0
it 's not a fear - based choice - it 's a logic - based choice			1
i 'm coming to realize how much our community fears death and shuns death and how much of the medical community almost view death as a failure			2
' if i can play , even the smallest part in helping to reduce fear or misunderstanding then it 's worth speaking up for			0
' since her death @entity11 's impact has indeed been felt and her choice to die has already sparked debate across the country			1
four other @entity54 states allow patients to seek aid in dying : @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			2
@entity98 says legislators in about a dozen further states plan to introduce right - to - die laws next year , including in @entity102 and @entity103			1
but the political reality is that such legislation has been pushed for years , often unsuccessfully			2
the @entity106 passed a bill last week that would allow physicians to prescribe life - ending drugs to terminally ill patients , with some legislators citing @entity11 's story as a deciding factor in their vote			1
but @entity115 gov. @entity115 has said he opposes the measure			0

it shows messages from those who agree with her campaign across the @entity54 in @entity22 , the @entity135 this week passed a resolution that urges the @entity137 to not prosecute physicians and family members who offer aid in dying to the terminally ill. but the state has no current bills or ballot measures on the issue			2

@entity146 , a @entity152 , said it has been difficult getting bills out of the judiciary committee when they are opposed by the state 's @entity157 leadership			0
@entity146 , whose 63 - year - old father died of the same type of brain cancer as @entity11 , said the young woman 's campaign and his family 's situation made it apparent why such bills are needed in @entity147 and elsewhere			1
' i had to watch my father die of cancer ... it was the most gut - wrenching experience our family and he had to endure , ' @entity146 said			1
' he would always tell me this is not the way he wanted to live			2
' @entity177 said its website has had more than 5 million unique visitors during the past month , while @entity11 's two previous videos have been viewed more than 13 million times on @entity182 alone			1
' i sense immense momentum right now , ' said @entity184 , president of @entity98			1
' @entity0 is a new voice for a new generation of activists ... she devoted her precious energy to help ensure other dying @entity54 would have a choice			2

' i know my family will continue to take this torch along for me that they 'll believe in the importance of what i 'm doing , ' she said			0
' if there 's one message to come away with from everything i 've been through it is no matter what life presents you with , never be afraid to use your voice			2
speak up for yourself , advocate			0
' not all the response to @entity118 's decision has been positive			2
some religious groups and social conservatives , including a @entity230 official and the @entity231 , have heavily criticized it			0
just days after @entity11 's death , the @entity230 's top bioethics official called her choice ' reprehensible ' and said physician - assisted suicide should be condemned			1
but @entity11 's mother , @entity237 , issued a sharp written response , saying the @entity230 official 's comments came as the family was grieving and were ' more than a slap in the face			1
' ' my twenty - nine - year - old daughter 's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation , ' she wrote			1
' @entity255 is a harsh word			0
it means : ' very bad ; deserving very strong criticism			0
' @entity255 is a word i 've used as a teacher to describe the actions of @entity263 , other political tyrants and the exploitation of children by pedophiles			0

' monsignor @entity285 , head of the @entity286 , made the remarks just two days after miss @entity0 , 29 , took a lethal prescription of drugs at her @entity24 home			0
speaking to @entity292 news agency @entity291 , he said : ' this woman ( took her own life ) thinking she would die with dignity , but this is the error			0
suicide is not a good thing			0
' it is a bad thing because it is saying no to life and to everything it means with respect to our mission in the world and towards those around us			0
' monsignor @entity285 , whose @entity286 is responsible for ethical issues in the @entity310 , even went so far as to describe assisted suicide , in itself , as a reprehensible ' absurdity '			1
he added : ' dignity is something different to putting an end to your own life			2
' the @entity310 opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide , teaching that life starts at the moment of conception and should end at the moment of natural death			1
@entity118 herself had words for such critics while she was still alive , in one of her final videos , she hit back at people who questioned her decision			0
' when people criticize me for not waiting longer , or whatever they 've decided is best for me , it hurts , ' she says in the heartbreaking video			0
