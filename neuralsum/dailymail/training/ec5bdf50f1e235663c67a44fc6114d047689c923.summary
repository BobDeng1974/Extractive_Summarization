the simple , yet surprisingly rousing , chant has become a hit in @entity33 , with celebrities such as @entity68 and @entity69 starring in tv adverts aimed at inspiring the nation to get in to the @entity73 spirit			2
the fervor has clearly caught on with the song now the unofficial chant of @entity16 's side			1
