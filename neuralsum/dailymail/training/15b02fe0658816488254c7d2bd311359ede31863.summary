25 exotic dancers at a strip club in @entity2 are filing a claim against police officers they say forced them to stay at the strip club against their will so they could take revealing pictures of them and their tattoos			1
ten officers on the @entity2 police force raided the @entity11 in @entity12 on march 6 to ' check dancers permits ' said the dancer 's lawyer @entity14			1
the claim says that during the check , 10 officers whose identities were not released , held dancers against their will for an hour without a proper warrant			2
' according to the girls , the officers told them to ' smile for the camera ' and made other ' arrogant and demanding ' comments that made them feel uncomfortable			0
' i got my pictures taken from at least my knees upwards , and i 'm half dressed			0
i felt kind of violated and like my rights were not there , ' said dancer @entity47 to @entity48			0
officers told the dancers that the photos for their working permits , which are updated on a yearly basis , needed to be renewed			2
lt. @entity54 told @entity48 that the officers did n't do anything against the rules and that photographing dancers and their tattoos , which acts as an identifier , is essential to confirming that dancers are who they say they are			2
@entity47 told @entity48 that police made her feel uncomfortable when they insisted they take photos of her and her tattoos while she was half naked lt. @entity66 said that taking photos of dancers and their tattoos is standard protocol when renewing work permits ' the city municipal code mandates that the police department go out and conduct these inspections			1
now to be an adult entertainer or to own a strip club -- those are both police regulated businesses , and to be in that profession you have to get a permit , ' said @entity66 to @entity48			0
' so being that we 're mandated to go out and conduct these inspections , the people and the holders of these permits are aware that these [ checks ] are coming , ' he added			0
regardless of what police say , the dancers are filing a civil rights claim against the @entity26 for more than $ 10,000			1
the manager for the @entity11 's @entity91 said that the girls felt pressured to do what the cops wanted because if they were to say ' no ' to their demands , their work permits could be taken away			1
@entity14 told @entity48 he thinks the claim will be denied in which case he will file a lawsuit .			0
