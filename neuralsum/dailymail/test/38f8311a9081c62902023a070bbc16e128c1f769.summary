in a hurry : @entity1 , 23 , with baby @entity2 , who was born in the back of an ambulance in an unusual twist of fate , described as a ' million to one shot ' , a young mother has given birth in the back of an ambulance for the second time in as many years after her baby boy was born on the same stretch of busy main road as his brother			1
@entity1 , 23 , pulled off the double against all the odds after having baby @entity2 on the way to hospital in the early hours of last thursday			1
her second little boy came along on the @entity19 in @entity20 two years after mrs @entity1 , of @entity21 , near @entity22 , had her first child @entity23 in exactly the same way			1
the surprised mother said : ' i ca n't believe it 's happened twice ! ' i ca n't imagine there are many people who have both their children like this - it must be a million to one			0
' mrs @entity1 's labour with her first son , @entity23 , was three hours long			1
the toddler , who is now two , ended up being delivered by his dad , @entity36 , 30 , in the back of the ambulance as they were driven through @entity40			2
@entity2 took just 72 minutes to arrive as the ambulance travelled past @entity42 at @entity43 , @entity44			0
' i really did n't want it to happen again and i was so adamant i was not going to have @entity2 in an ambulance , ' laughed mrs @entity1 , who is training to be an accountant			2
' but then it did get to that point when i realised i was not going to make it to the hospital again			0
' at least this time @entity36 was able to be by my side rather than delivering his son himself			2
' mrs @entity1 , whose husband is a self - employed forester , added : ' i did n't even know i was in labour with my first son @entity23 until i was pushing			1
' @entity36 was an absolute saint and so calm for me			0
he was the best midwife i could have had			0
' both times everything happened so quickly i did n't even have time to panic or think about it			0
' this time the couple were at home in bed when mrs @entity1 realised @entity2 was on his way at about 3am			2
they knew they did not have time to hang around for @entity36 's parents to arrive			0
luckily , a @entity70 neighbour popped in to look after @entity23 as he slept upstairs , blissfully unaware of the second great baby drama unfolding			2
the route : this shows where both @entity23 and @entity2 were born on the @entity19			1
@entity23 came along near @entity40 and @entity2 as the ambulance travelled past @entity42 at @entity43 , @entity44 happy family : @entity2 followed in the footsteps of his brother @entity23 ( pictured ) , two , who was delivered by his father @entity36 as he and wife @entity81 rushed to @entity20 and @entity83 mrs @entity1 said she had considered it might have been easier to have a midwife go to her , but was told home births were not available in her area			1
the mum - of - two opted to go to @entity20 and @entity83 instead of @entity89 , @entity90 , as she knows @entity44 and the hospital far better			0
and the couple joke that they are old hands when it comes to registering an ' in transit ' birth			0
mrs @entity1 , who grew up in nearby @entity97 , said : ' for @entity23 they had to put his place of birth as being in transit on the way to @entity20 and @entity83 , at @entity40 , so i imagine it will be just the same for @entity2			1

@entity1 , 23 , from @entity20 , said the odds must be ' a million to one '
her husband @entity36 delivered first son @entity23 on the @entity19 two years *ago*
history repeated itself when baby @entity2 also arrived on way to hospital
