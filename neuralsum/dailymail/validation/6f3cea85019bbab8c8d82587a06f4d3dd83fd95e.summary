former @entity1 presidents cost taxpayers more than $ 879,000 per year in pensions , personnel , benefits , travel and office expenses , and @entity9 's cumulative near - $ 16 million total is bringing him new scrutiny as his wife makes the case for a @entity15 run of her own			1
@entity16 reported @entity9 's take in 2014 , amounting to slightly less than $ 1.14 million per year , based on a paper from the nonpartisan @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
that amount is still less than @entity22 's $ 1.18 million annual haul			1
but since @entity9 has had an eight - year head start , his overall benefits are the highest by far , totalling $ 15,938,000 since he left the @entity15 in january 2001			1
his disbursement each year from the @entity26 includes $ 96,000 for salaries ; insiders told @entity29 that some of that money has been passed through to staffers at the @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
the foundation also insisted the @entity9 's personal funds , not taxpayer dollars , paid for the now - infamous private email server that his wife @entity34 used exclusively while secretary of state			1
mrs. @entity34 said tuesday during a contentious press conference in @entity58 that the former president set up the server for his own staff 's use , and she began using it later			1
as she ramps up for a presidential campaign , critics have piled on with accusations that she intentionally avoided using a government - issued email address while she was the nation 's top diplomat in order to hide electronic communications from @entity73 archivists			2
but she insisted on tuesday that decision was made purely for ' convenience			0
' the larger question raised by @entity29 is whether it 's appropriate for tax dollars to subsidize the salaries of nonprofit employees while their work is leveraged to support a potential presidential candidate			0
while @entity9 has received more post-white @entity15 cash overall than any other living former president , @entity22 ’s annual numbers are the highest the @entity35 is now @entity34 's principal political messenger in the public sphere			1
although its work does n't include overt politicking or political campaigning , there 's no mistaking that the public sees what @entity97 wags call ' @entity99 ' – the amalgamation of the family 's political , commercial and philanthropic arms – as a single entity			2
sources also told @entity29 that staffers whose compensation straddles @entity9 's foundation purse and his government benefits include former @entity15 aide @entity110 and senior @entity35 staffer @entity111			1
the paper also speculated that @entity113 , a former union official who is now @entity9 's chief of staff and advised @entity34 's 2008 campaign , has followed suit			1
@entity116 observed @entity113 's arrival at the foundation in 2012 ' as @entity34 's planting a sentinel ' there			2
annual payments to former @entity1 chief executives are guaranteed by the @entity124 of 1958 , a law passed in response to the predicament of former president @entity127 , who fell on hard times after he moved from @entity97 back to @entity129			2
at the time , @entity127 had to take out a personal loan from a @entity129 bank to pay his bills			0
today the law provides payments to @entity9 , @entity22 , his father @entity22 , and @entity135			1
which way to the @entity136 ? @entity137 is set to reap an annual windfall beginning in 2017 that will dwarf his current $ 400,000 salary former @entity1 presidents receive millions of dollars over the course of their post-office years , including living examples @entity9 , @entity135 , @entity22 and his father @entity143 the @entity144 ' burgeoning personal wealth , including a mammoth $ 15 million advance for @entity34 's memoir ' @entity147 ' and a string of six - figure speaking fees for her and @entity33 , have raised questions about whether 21st - century former presidents still need to be on the government dole			1
@entity155 @entity154 rep. @entity154 , now chairman of the powerful @entity156 , introduced a bill in 2012 called the @entity158 to reform the practice			0
the legislation , which never received a positive committee vote , would have capped the government 's total annual spending on former presidents to $ 400,000 each			1
and that amount would have been reduced dollar - for - dollar by any money they earned			0
under those guidelines , @entity9 would have received nothing during most of his post-presidency			0
his earnings for individual speeches have reportedly topped $ 500,000			0
tax returns the @entity144 released in 2010 showed a total of $ 111 million in earnings from 2000 through 2007			2
' nobody wants our former presidents living the remainder of their lives destitute , " @entity154 said when he floated his bill three years ago , ' but the fact is none of our former presidents are poor			0
' ' reports actually indicate that between book tours and speaking fees , these men are making millions of dollars a year			0
there 's little reason why @entity1 taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they 're doing fine on their own			0
' his spokespersons did not respond to a request for comment about whether he has plans to use his influential platform to reintroduce the bill in the current @entity202			0
@entity135 , who left office in 1981 , spends the least among the four living former presidents			2
the @entity26 budgeted $ 466,000 for his total upkeep in 2014			0
former presidents ' pensions , @entity208 , and other federal benefits uploaded by @entity210			0

the @entity124 provides pensions and office expenses for @entity9 , both @entity214 and @entity135
a 2014 @entity19 report described the payments , *pegging* @entity9 's total at $ 15.9 million , an average of $ 1.14 million per year
he has an 8 - year head start on @entity22 , who nevertheless *collects* the most each year – an average of $ 1.18 million
some of the @entity9 *payouts* are subsidizing staff who work at his family foundation , now *closely* tied to his wife @entity34
@entity9 spokesman insists the infamous private email server in the power - couple 's home was paid for out of @entity9 's *pocket*
