testifying under the @entity146 , the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly			0
but she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks			0

dirty : the attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home , pictured , police said she identified @entity7 in the film laughing in the background , telling the attacker to ' beat that ho			1
' ' did the guys just take turns with you ? ' prosecutor @entity165 asked			0
' yes sir , ' the girl said			0
the girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified			0
she mostly gave short answers to questions , often pausing to stare at the floor or ceiling of the @entity29 courtroom before responding			0
she described another alleged rape in november 2010 that started in a different @entity20 home the defendants called the ' boom boom ' room , according to prosecutors , and that continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer			2
asked by @entity165 if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day , the girl responded , ' probably			0
' jurors were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers found inside and outside the house in the november incident			0
accused : @entity193 , left , and @entity194 , right , were among those accused of raping the girl gang - rape : @entity198 , left , and @entity199 , right , are among the 20 men and boys in the case three people who have pleaded guilty — two adults and a juvenile who has since turned 18 — also testified yesterday			1

the other adult , @entity211 , 28 , and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not @entity7			1
@entity111 questioned the girl for about six minutes , during which time he asked whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never had sex with @entity7			1
the girl said she did n’t remember saying that			0
during opening statements , @entity165 told jurors he would present them with videotaped and written confessions in which @entity7 admitted to raping the girl			1
' what took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking , ' @entity165 said			0
alleged attacker : @entity233 , pictured , is one of the men accused of raping the 11 - year - old the prosecutor added that while the girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos , these individuals had ' duped , tricked and talked her into doing things against her best interests , ' according to the @entity243			1
authorities say the then 11 - year - old was assaulted at least five times between mid-september and early december 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student to a 28 - year - old			0
during the trial , a videotaped police interview in which @entity7 admitted he and eight other men took turns having sex with the girl , sometimes two at a time , was shown in court , although jurors were not present			1
in the video , which @entity7 's lawyers argued should not be allowed as evidence , the 20 - year - old initially denied ever touching the girl , but he later broke down and told investigators he engaged in oral sex with her , according to the @entity243			1
@entity111 tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out , arguing that police improperly questioned @entity7			1
the investigation into the shocking gang - rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl 's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11 - year - old being raped in an abandoned trailer			1
those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records			0
the case brought unflattering attention to @entity20 , a town of 9,000 people , after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened , saying she wore makeup , looked older and was n't properly supervised by her parents			2
other community residents , as well as groups from outside of town , sharply criticised those suggestions			0
it has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated			0
all of the suspects are black , while the girl is @entity308			0
two other adults have previously pleaded guilty , with one receiving a 15 - year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing			0
six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty			0
they received 7 - year prison terms , but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time			2
most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child , while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child .			1
