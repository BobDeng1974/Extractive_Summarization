@entity0 may have failed in its @entity2 landing at the weekend , but @entity3 is never one to rest on his laurels			1
during an online chat , the billionaire entrepreneur said he is forging ahead with plans to colonise @entity8 by 2020 - and will release more details about how he intends to reach the red planet before the end of the year			1
he hinted at how his @entity8 transport system will work , and said he is working on a new range of spacesuits that will look as good as they work			1
he hinted at how the @entity8 transport system will work , and said he is working on a new range of spacesuits the comments were made by mr @entity3 during an @entity26 on @entity27			1
when asked to expand on his @entity8 lander plans , the 43 - year - old said : ' the @entity8 transport system will be a completely new architecture			1
' i 'm hoping to present that towards the end of this year			1
good thing we did n't do it sooner , as we have learnt a huge amount from @entity2 and @entity37			2
' mr @entity3 wants to help establish a colony of up to 80,000 people on the planet , but admitted he ’d like to start small , with a group of 10 people , and build the colony from there			1

however , he admitted he ’d like to start small , with a group of 10 people , and build the colony from there			2
he ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket , fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane , to reach the red planet in six years			1
it would need to be much heavier than @entity0 ’s current rockets , including the @entity54			2
during the mission , mr @entity3 said the goal is take 100 metric tonnes of ' useful payload ' to the surface , and this will require ' a very big spaceship and booster system			1
' and , on the subject of what the @entity8 visitors will wear , mr @entity3 said his spacesuit design is coming together and will also be unveiled later this year			1
' we are putting a lot of effort into design aesthetics , not just utility			0
' it needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well			2
[ it 's ] really difficult to achieve both			0

' ‘ at @entity8 , you can start a self - sustaining civilisation and grow it into something really big , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
‘ i think we 're making some progress in that direction - not as fast as i 'd like			0
’ in april last year , @entity0 carried out a successful rocket test during which the firm launched a two - stage falcon 9 rocket from @entity105			2
the rocket is reusable and it crashed into a target in the @entity108 shortly after the @entity37 delivered supplies to the @entity110 ( @entity110 )			0
at the weekend , the space firm attempted to land the reusable rocket on a floating platform off the east coast of @entity115			0
however , the first stage of the unmanned @entity2 rocket made it to the platform , but the booster came down too hard and broke apart			2
the test was carried out as part of a supply mission to the @entity110			0
' close , but no cigar this time , ' mr @entity3 tweeted			1
although , he said the test bodes well for the future , though			0

during the mission , mr @entity3 said the goal is take 100 metric tonnes of ' useful payload ' to the surface ( illustrated ) , and this will require ' a very big spaceship and booster system ' @entity0 successfully launched a supply rocket to the @entity110 on saturday , the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012 mr @entity3 maintains that recovering and reusing rockets is essential for bringing down launch costs and speeding up operations			1
the primary mission for @entity0 was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of supplies ordered by @entity146 , including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company 's cargo ship last fall , as well as extra groceries			0
a ship with @entity0 staff watched from a safe 10 miles ( 16km ) away as the booster approached the platform , marked with a giant @entity159 @entity3 reported that the platform itself - 300 feet ( 91 metres ) by 100 feet ( 30 metres ) , with wings stretching the width to 170 feet ( 51 metres ) - was fine following the attempted touchdown well before dawn			1

the first stage of the unmanned @entity2 rocket made it to the platform , but the booster came down too hard and broke apart but he said some of the equipment on deck will need to be replaced			2
in the weeks preceding the landing test , @entity3 had estimated there was a 50/50 chance , at best , that the @entity2 's first - stage booster would land vertically on the platform			1

a pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well , but company officials conceded before saturday 's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging			2
once separated from the upper stage of the rocket saturday , the main booster re-ignited as planned for the flyback , according to @entity0			0
automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous , modified barge			0
the @entity219 maintained the ability , as always , to destroy the booster if it strayed off course			0
the shipment - the sixth by @entity0 since 2012 - is needed more than usual because of the recent loss of another company 's supply ship			0
@entity229 's @entity228 rocket exploded seconds after liftoff in october , destroying the entire payload and damaging the @entity233 launch complex			0
that rocket is grounded until next year			2
this @entity0 delivery was supposed to occur before @entity236 , but was delayed by a flawed test - firing of the rocket			0
then a problem with the rocket 's steering system cropped up at the last minute during tuesday 's initial launch attempt			0
@entity146 is paying @entity0 and @entity229 to keep the space station stocked in the wake of the retired shuttle program			0
the $ 1.6billion contract with @entity0 calls for 12 flights ; the $ 1.9billion contract with @entity229 calls for eight			0
@entity0 also returns items to @entity250 ; @entity229 ca n't			0
mr @entity3 was optimistic on @entity251 in spite of the crash , especially considering the feat had never before been attempted in the history of space flight			1

the comments were made during an online live chat on @entity27
@entity261 said he is forging ahead with plans to colonise @entity8 by 2020
he will reveal details about his @entity8 transporter before the end of the year
and said he is working on spacesuits that will look as good as they work
mr @entity3 hopes to establish a colony on the red planet by 2020
