' unduly lenient ' : @entity0 was given a 40 - week suspended sentence after his defence argued that his wife could n't speak @entity4 the suspended sentence handed to a @entity7 teacher who sexually abused an 11 - year - old girl will be reviewed by the attorney general after protests from @entity13 women 's groups			1
@entity0 from @entity14 was given a 40 - week suspended sentence for abusing the girl , after his defence argued that his wife could n't speak @entity4 and the household was dependent on him			1
but that decision will now be looked at again after dozens of people complained to the attorney general 's office			2
the @entity20 could then send the case to the court of appeal to be reconsidered			2
the abuse took place over a nine - month period when @entity0 , a respected @entity25 scholar , was giving the victim and her two brothers @entity7 lessons at their home three times a week			1
@entity31 heard that @entity32 repeatedly rubbed the girl 's legs and reached under her headscarf to touch her chest as she recited the holy book			1
her ordeal only came to light when her brothers , aged seven and 13 , were overheard talking about it by their horrified mother who contacted the police			0
on the day he was arrested he was due to teach 30 children at a mosque near his home in @entity14			0
he was subsequently found guilty of five counts of sexually touching a child and sentenced to 20 weeks jail			1
but a judge chose to suspend the sentence for two years after the court heard his family were dependent on him and he is ill with kidney problems			1
after the sentence was handed down on monday friend of the victim 's family immediately dubbed is a ' total disgrace ’			1
‘ what type of message does this send out to paedophiles ? he should be behind bars for this type of abuse			0
we are all horrified , ' said the friend , who asked not to be named			0
now a spokesman for the attorney general 's office has said that following an outpouring of complaints about @entity32 's sentence officials would look again at the decision			2
' we received around 50 requests to review the sentence of @entity0 , ' the spokesman said			1
' the @entity20 will look at the case and sentencing remarks of the judge and decide if it should be referred to the court of appeal			2
' pervert : @entity31 heard that @entity32 over a nine - month period repeatedly rubbed an 11 - year - old girl 's legs and reached under her headscarf to touch her chest as he taught her and her brothers the @entity7 the protests were spearheaded by the @entity91 @entity90 who wrote a letter to the attorney general expressing their outrage at the decision and calling for it to be reviewed			1
@entity98 , chairman of the network , said she welcomed the decision			1
she said : ' such unduly lenient sentences damage the public confidence			0
victims of sexual abuse within the @entity105 find it very difficult to speak out , especially if the perpetrator is a religious teacher as they are held in such high esteem			2
' what we often find what happens is that there is a tendency to blame the victim			0
this was the case in @entity14 and his lenient sentence fed into that			0
' there needs to be stiffer sentences in cases of sexual abuse to send out a message that abuse will not be tolerated			0
' often the community can be part of the problem because we prioritise the honour of the community over the welfare of the victim			0
' we need to be the first to speak out			0
