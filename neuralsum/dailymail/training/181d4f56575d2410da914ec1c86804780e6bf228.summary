by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity2 has finally joined in the excitement surrounding the @entity5 tennis championships , held at the @entity6 in @entity7			0
the 25 - year - old girlfriend of @entity9 , usually so expressive when watching her partner , has been looking decidedly glum and stony - faced during the @entity11 thus far , despite @entity9 ’s success			0
but last night , on day eight of the tournament , @entity2 was back to her old demonstrative self as she watched @entity9 play @entity15 of @entity16			1
and while her face was a picture of joy and exhilaration , her fashion choices for the day were rather more relaxed			0
usually smartly - attired in @entity40 classics , @entity2 opted for a much more casual outfit			0
teaming a pair of jeans with a cream t - shirt emblazoned with the words ‘ @entity46 ’ over a lace camisole , @entity2 finished off her outfit with a pair of black @entity50			2
@entity2 wore a low key outfit of a cream t - shirt over a lace camisole and a pair of blue jeans while her outfit was casual , @entity2 's hair looked as perfect as ever her outfit may have been casual but her accessories certainly were n't as she carried a £ 1,600 @entity60 tote @entity2 applauds her boyfriend of eight years as he walked onto court for his third match of the @entity11 but while her clothes were laid - back , @entity2 upped the fashion ante with some serious arm candy			1
she accessorised her low - key look with a £ 1,600 peach leather @entity69 bag slung over her arm			1
@entity2 was last seen on day four of the championships when she watched @entity9 bear @entity72 , though her mood appeared very different			2
despite @entity9 winning in straight sets , @entity2 ’s face remaining as poker - straight as her hair as she watched @entity9 win 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in one hour and 46 minutes			1
with her heavy eye make - up only serving to emphasis her glum expression , @entity2 barely cracked a smile .			0

@entity2 watched @entity9 win against @entity15 on day eight of @entity5
was barely able to contain her excitement and joy at victory
change from her *recent* glum *demeanour* during the @entity11
opted for a low key outfit of jeans and t - shirt
but still kept the *glamour* with a £ 1,600 @entity69 tote bag
