by @entity0 the @entity1 has been forced to spend £ 1m on super-sized @entity3 scanners to deal with the escalating obesity crisis			1
the new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled from 25st ( 160kg ) to 47st ( 300kg )			1
around 65 per cent of people in @entity11 are now overweight or obese - and the @entity1 already spends an estimated £ 5.1billion a year treating obesity - related illnesses			1
the obesity crisis has forced the @entity1 to spend £ 1m on ct scanners			1
the new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled from 25st ( 160kg ) to 47st ( 300kg ) ct scans use x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body			1
more detailed than standard x-rays , the scans can produce images of structures inside the body , including the internal organs , blood vessels , bones and tumours			2
the new super-size machines also scan at twice the speed than conventional ones , @entity33 reported			1
this is significant as patients are usually required to hold their breath during the scan - since chest movement can affect the image - and some obese people can find it harder to hold their breath			1
a recent report on @entity3 scanners compiled by @entity48 found that over the past two decades , the weight allowance of imaging tables has increased by 88 per cent			2
x ray generator power , which contributes to scanners providing a good quality image despite the patient ’s size , has increased by 380 per cent - from around @entity56 to @entity57			2
the size of the bore , where the patient lies , has increased from 70cm to 80cm			0
the changing shape of @entity3 scanners in response to patient waistlines			0
the new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled commenting on the report , @entity69 , ct business manager at @entity48 , said : ' the number of bariatric patients being referred for @entity3 has more than doubled in the last 25 years and this is predicted to continue rising			1
a computerised tomography ( @entity3 ) scan uses x-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body			1
ct scans are also sometimes known as @entity3 scans , which stands for computerised axial tomography			0
during a @entity3 , which is painless and takes five to 10 minutes , depending on the part of the body being scanned , patients lie on their backs on a bed			0
the scanner consists of an x-ray tube that rotates around the body and the patient is usually moved continuously through this rotating beam			0
the x-rays are received by a detector on the opposite side of the body and an image of the scan will be produced by a computer			2
the images produced by a ct scan are called tomograms and are more detailed than standard x-rays			2
a ct scan can produce images of structures inside the body , including the internal organs , blood vessels , bones and tumours			1
source : @entity114 ' we have witnessed a growing need and demand for obesity provision from hospital imaging departments across the country to ensure patients of all sizes can gain access to the treatment they need			2
' one large hospital in the @entity126 of @entity11 recently purchased a £ 1m super-sized scanner , according to @entity33			0
figures released earlier this year by @entity11 revealed this is the fattest region , where 68 per cent are overweight or obese			0
and in june , a @entity131 request found rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients			0
money is being been spent on reinforced beds , wider corridors and even larger morgue fridges as a result of the obesity epidemic			0
@entity143 , of the @entity144 , said : ' the rapidly expanding size of @entity146 is shocking , but sadly , not surprising			0
' but it is absolutely tragic that as a nation we are becoming so fat we are having to redesign medical equipment			0
' two years ago it was reported that @entity1 hospitals had been forced to ask zoos and vets to scan patients who were too obese to fit into hospital scanners			1
the @entity157 said at the time that its ct scanners , customised for horses , could be used to accommodate patients weighing 30 stone or more but they would need to get a special licence to scan humans .			0

new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat and scan quicker
weight they can take has nearly doubled to 47st and space inside bigger
@entity1 already spends £ 5.1billion a year treating obesity - related illnesses
