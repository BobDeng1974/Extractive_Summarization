by @entity0 published : 04:55 est , 26 august 2013 updated : 05:25 est , 26 august 2013 a set of twins who were born three months early and were not expected to survive are to start school this term			2
@entity6 and @entity7 suffered breathing problems , bleeding in the brain , heart defects and hernias and doctors said it was a miracle that they survived			1
now almost six years later , the boys are a picture of health and ready to start their first day of school - a date that their mother , @entity20 , 36 , feared she would never see			1
@entity6 and @entity7 , now six , were born three months prematurely and it was feared that they would not survive			1
they both suffered breathing difficulties , bleeds on the brain and hernias @entity26 couple @entity20 , and @entity27 , 45 , were over the moon when they were told they would be having twins			1
but the babies developed twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome - a disease of the placenta that affects identical twin pregnancies - and the couple feared they would lose them			1
things went from bad to worse when one their babies developed the life - threatening condition absent end diastolic flow ( @entity43 ) , which stops the blood flowing through the umbilical cord properly			1
mrs @entity46 said : ‘ being told on the day of my 12 week scan that i was having twins was an incredible experience			2
‘ but from then on everything was just horrendous			0
‘ we had several @entity53 scares , then at 25 weeks i was told that @entity7 had @entity43 and there was a chance he would n't survive because he could n't breathe			1
’ in the womb @entity7 and @entity6 ( pictured with their mother , @entity20 ) developed twin - to - twin transfusion syndrome - a disease of the placenta that can affect identical twins @entity7 had to be delivered as quickly as possible , but if he arrived too early , he would be too weak to survive			1
‘ it was awful , just awful ’ , mrs @entity46 said			0
‘ four weeks of just watching every second on the clock tick by			2
‘ it was the worst time of my life			2
’ the boys were eventually delivered at 29 weeks by an emergency caesarean - section , and rushed off to intensive care where doctors fought to save them			1
@entity6 ( pictured when he was seven - hours - old ) was born with a hole in his heart and it was feared that he would have to have surgery to repair it			1
however , fortunately the hole repaired itself @entity7 ( pictured when he was seven - hours - old ) and @entity6 were rushed straight from the operating theatre to intensive care and it was six hours before their mother knew if they had survived mrs @entity46 said : ‘ i did n't even get to see them			1
‘ there was a team of about 17 people , and my babies were just rushed away			0
‘ i was left for about six hours before anyone could even tell me if they were alive or not			0
’ they had survived , but within days @entity89 and mrs @entity46 were told they had suffered bleeding in their brains - a common complication of prematurity which can cause cerebral palsy - and that @entity6 might require an operation to repair a hole in his heart			1
in the womb , @entity7 also developed the life - threatening condition absent end diastolic flow ( @entity43 ) , which stops the blood flowing through the umbilical cord properly thankfully the hole healed itself , but weighing just two and a half pounds , the boys had to be watched closely by doctors and nurses at the hospital for almost two months before doctors started to think about discharging them			1
then , just as @entity89 and mrs @entity46 thought they would get to take their babies home , @entity6 developed a hernia and was rushed to @entity112 , in @entity113 , to be operated on			1
because he was so small and fragile , doctors were worried he would not survive			0
mrs @entity46 said : ‘ it was really hard that day because they discharged @entity7 , and @entity6 was taken away in an ambulance on his own to go for surgery			1
the boys are now both healthy and are starting school			2
their mother , @entity20 , says that she always told herself that they would be fine if they could reach their first day of school without any long term health problems ‘ i was left with just one baby , and @entity27 was back at work by then			0
‘ it was really hard			0
i 'd waited so long to take them home , but ended up taking one baby home for my sister to look after before driving to @entity131 to be with the other one			0
’ but the problems did not stop there , and just 24 hours after @entity6 was operated on , @entity7 too developed hernia			1
mrs @entity46 said : ‘ they were each in @entity131 for two days and three nights			0
‘ they try under all circumstances to avoid giving general anaesthetic to babies under 4lbs because it 's so risky			0
’ mrs @entity46 said : ' being told on the day of my 12 week scan that i was having twins was an incredible experience			2
but from then on everything was just horrendous with the pregnancy ' when mrs @entity46 eventually got to take the twins home she was worried they would have lasting health problems			2
she always told herself if they could reach primary school without any problems then they 'd be in the clear			0
@entity6 and @entity7 are starting school in the same class at @entity156 , @entity26 , this term			1
@entity6 and @entity7 are starting school in the same class at @entity156 , @entity26 , this term mrs @entity46 said : ‘ having them home eventually was wonderful , but it took a very long time before i could relax			1
‘ they were just under 4lbs - and it was still before their due date			2
‘ i tried not to think about all that had happened , it was too distressing			0
‘ when you read about all the complications of premature births , you 're preparing yourself for children with cerebral palsy or learning difficulties			2
mrs @entity46 says that she will be extremely proud when she sees the boys walk through the school gates for the first time			0
she says that they are now ' healthy , robust ' children ‘ to come through the @entity53 , then the @entity43 and the premature delivery and then the various complications , is a miracle			0
‘ it almost defied all medical explanation			0
‘ i always said if they could make it to primary one that would be them in the all - clear			0
‘ now they 're really healthy , robust kids			0
‘ when they walk through the school gates i 'll be bursting with pride			0
‘ there will be a whole mix of emotions , it 'll be really overwhelming , but it 'll be wonderful			0
