by @entity0 as millions of @entity4 race to meet tuesday 's tax deadline , their chances of getting audited are lower than they have been in years			1
budget cuts and new responsibilities are straining the @entity9 's ability to police tax returns			1
this year , the @entity9 will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s			1
taxpayer services are suffering , too , with millions of phone calls to the @entity9 going unanswered			0
the chances of @entity4 getting audited is the lowest it 's been since the 1980s ' we keep going after the people who look like the worst of the bad guys , ' @entity9 commissioner @entity18 said in an interview			1
' but there are going to be some people that we should catch , either in terms of collecting the revenue from them or prosecuting them , that we 're not going to catch			0
' better technology is helping to offset some budget cuts			0
if you report making $ 40,000 in wages and your employer tells the @entity9 you made $ 50,000 , the agency 's computers probably will catch that			2
the same is true for investment income and many common deductions that are reported to the @entity9 by financial institutions			2
but if you operate a business that deals in cash , with income or expenses that are not independently reported to the @entity9 , your chances of getting caught are lower than they have been in years			1
last year , the @entity9 audited less than 1 percent of all returns from individuals , the lowest rate since 2005			1
this year , @entity18 said , ' the numbers will go down			0
' @entity4 taxes are due this tuesday and many are scrambling to finish all of the paperwork @entity18 was confirmed as @entity9 commissioner in december			1
he took over an agency under siege on several fronts			0
last year , the @entity9 acknowledged agents improperly singled out conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax - exempt status from 2010 to 2012			1
the revelation has led to five ongoing investigations , including three by congressional committees , and outraged lawmakers who control the agency 's budget			0
the @entity9 also is implementing big parts of president @entity69 's health law , including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance			1
republicans in @entity74 abhor the law , putting another bull 's - eye on the agency 's back			0
the animosity is reflected in the @entity9 budget , which has declined from $ 12.1 billion in 2010 to $ 11.3 billion in the current budget year			2
@entity69 has proposed a 10 percent increase for next year ; @entity73 are balking			1
rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , chairman of the @entity86 subcommittee that oversees the @entity9 budget , called the request ' both meaningless and pointless ' because it exceeds spending caps already set by @entity74			0
the @entity9 also is implementing big parts of president @entity69 's health law , including enforcing the mandate that most people get health insurance @entity18 said he suspects some people think that if they cut funds to the @entity9 , the agency wo n't be able to implement the health law			1
they 're wrong , he said			0
the @entity9 is legally obligated to enforce the health law , @entity18 said			1
that means budget savings will have to be found elsewhere			0
@entity18 said he can cut spending in three areas : enforcement , taxpayer services and technology			0
technology upgrades can only be put off for so long , he said , so enforcement and taxpayer services are @entity110 year , only 61 percent of taxpayers calling the @entity9 for help got it			1
this year , @entity18 said he expects the numbers to be similar			0
to help free up operators , callers with complicated tax questions are directed to the agency 's website			0
' the problem with complicated questions is they take longer , ' @entity18 said			0
your chances of getting audited vary greatly , based on your income			1
the more you make , the more likely you are to get a letter from the @entity9			2
only 0.9 percent of people making less than $ 200,000 were audited last year			2
that 's the lowest rate since the @entity9 began publishing the statistic in 2006			1
by contrast , 10.9 percent of people making $ 1 million or more were audited			2
that 's the lowest rate since 2010			1
only 0.6 percent of business returns were audited , but the rate varied greatly depending on the size of the business			1
about 16 percent of corporations with more than $ 10 million in assets were audited			0
your chances of getting audited vary greatly , based on your income			1
the more you make , the more likely you are to get a letter from the @entity9 most people do n't have much of an opportunity to cheat on their taxes , said @entity142 , a former @entity9 lawyer who now teaches law at @entity144			1
your employer probably reports your wages to the @entity9 , your bank reports interest income , your broker reports investment income and your lender reports the amount of interest you paid on your mortgage			2
' anybody who 's an employee , who gets paid by an employer , has a limited ability to take risks on their tax returns , ' @entity142 said			0
' i think people who own their own business or are self - employed have a much greater opportunity ( to cheat ) , and i think the @entity9 knows that , too			2
' one flag for the @entity9 is when your deductions or expenses do n't match your income , said @entity169 , the partner in charge of tax and business services at @entity173 , an accounting firm			2
for example , if you deduct $ 70,000 in real estate taxes and mortgage interest , but only report $ 100,000 in income			0
' that would at least beg the question , how are you living ? ' @entity169 said			0
@entity18 said the @entity9 could scrutinize more returns - and collect billions more in revenue - with more resources			2
the president 's budget proposal says the @entity9 would collect an additional $ 6 for every $ 1 increase in the agency 's enforcement budget			1
@entity18 said he makes that argument all the time , but for some reason , it 's not playing well in @entity74			0
' i say that and everybody shrugs and goes on about their business , ' @entity18 said			0
' i have not figured out either philosophically or psychologically why nobody seems to care whether we collect the revenue or not			0

this year , the @entity9 will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s meaning audits will be lower too

the chances of getting audited vary greatly , based on income and the more one makes , the more likely they are to get a letter from the @entity9
