the trial of a man who has admitted to the murder and mutilation of his girlfriend and her two young children looks to have been jeopardized by the way police handled his arrest			1

@entity9 admitted to murdering the three during a crack cocaine and vodka - induced rage on @entity23 , 2008 , according to @entity24			1
he confessed to doctors that he ' ripped ' his girlfriend in half			2
@entity9 , who is bipolar , also said that he cut off her son 's male organ before killing him			0
defense attorneys for alleged triple - murderer @entity9 are trying to have the confession he gave police tossed out of court because they refused to let him meet with the attorneys in the days following his 2008 arrest tragic : the bodies of @entity12 and her children @entity15 , 7 , and @entity14 , 2 , were found inside their trailer in @entity20 on @entity23 in 2008 scene : @entity9 is facing the death penalty for the grisly killings of @entity12 , 26 , and her children , 2 - year - old @entity14 and 7 - year - old @entity15 , inside their home in @entity18 , a small town in @entity19 , @entity20 however what can now be used as evidence at @entity9 's murder trial - set for october - is up the air because of the way he was treated after being arrested or ' detained '			1
newly released court documents say that defense attorneys were initially barred from seeing @entity9			1
@entity9 was hiding in a closet , wearing only black underwear , his body covered in scratches and his feet wet with blood , when police arrived at the murder scene			1
he was taken to @entity60 ( now @entity61 ) in @entity62 , because he told them he had swallowed a lot of pills			0
he was where he was listed in the patient registry as ' @entity68 '			0
an ambulance officer who checked him out at the scene described him as ' psychotic '			0
the new court documents show that attorneys from the @entity73 had asserted they had the right to visit @entity75 at the hospital in the days after his arrest , but that the @entity78 refused			1
@entity9 as seen in a previous court appearance			2
he has been in jail since 2008 deceased : two - year - old @entity81 was said to have been playing with a toy cell phone when @entity9 , awaking from a crack cocaine and vodka bender , lashed out at her after lashing out at her young daughter , @entity9 is said to have confessed to doctors that he then turned on girlfriend @entity12 and that he ' ripped her in half ' @entity9 is also alleged to have cut off the male organ of seven - year - old @entity89 before killing him deputies used a variety of legal pretexts to claim they could keep @entity75 isolated without legal advice			1
they maintained he had not officially been arrested but had been ' detained ' , despite being handcuffed to a hospital bed , and that the constitutional guarantee of a defense attorney did n't yet apply			2
only after @entity9 confessed to the crimes - after being moved to an interrogation cell at the @entity78 - did deputies tell him that lawyers from the @entity73 had been trying to see him			1
@entity9 's defense team is now arguing that law enforcement 's decision to sequester him from attorneys — going so far as to register him under a false name at a hospital — violated his constitutional rights , and that his confession should be tossed			1
' you 're entitled to an attorney as soon as you 're in custody or under arrest , ' public defender @entity109 said			0
' to deny that he was in custody is , i think , very foolish on their part			0
it flies in the face of common sense			0
' @entity9 has gained a significant amount of weight in jail and is almost unrecognizable to the way he looked at the time of his arrest police shut off the street in @entity18 where the crimes occurred in may 2008 however authorities say that at the time they did n't know what they were dealing with when handling @entity75			2
' we had two possible things — either an only witness to a crime or a suspect to a crime , ' retired homicide detective @entity139 , lead investigator on the case at the time , testified last month			0
the suppression of the confession could be a significant blow for prosecutors as they prepare for @entity9 's trial			2
@entity19 circuit judge @entity147 will hear additional testimony and arguments on the matter in march			0
afterward , he will make a ruling about whether the confession can be presented to a jury .			0

@entity9 , 35 , was arrested in relation to the murder of girlfriend @entity12 , 26 , and her children , 2 - year - old @entity14 and 7 - year - old @entity15 , at their @entity20 home in 2008
he was found hiding in the wardrobe in black underwear covered in blood
he was taken to hospital after telling police he had taken ' a lot of pills '
new court documents say police refused to let defense attorneys see @entity9
he then confessed to the murders
defense attorneys are now trying to have the confession thrown out of court
the prosecution are pushing for the death penalty and the case would be seriously affected without the confession
