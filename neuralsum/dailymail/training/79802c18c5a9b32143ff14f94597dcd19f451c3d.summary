a first - half penalty from one of @entity3 ’s more senior players , @entity1 , piled the pressure on @entity6 manager @entity5 as the home team notched a third - round upset for the second successive season			1
but this victory at @entity11 is likely to be remembered as a coming - of - age match for a young side awash with home - grown talent			2
six of the players involved came through the @entity19 club ’s youth system , most of them teenagers and playing in the youth edition of this tournament not long ago			1
‘ it ’s almost a lower league class of 92 , ’ said @entity3 assistant manager @entity24 in a reference to @entity27 ’s fabled group that included @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity32 brothers			2
‘ this is a great day for the football club , ’ he added			0
@entity1 converts from the penalty spot to put @entity3 1 - 0 up against @entity6 early in the first - half at @entity11 the @entity3 players celebrate with @entity1 after his penalty set the ball rolling for @entity3 in their @entity43 scalp @entity3 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity44 6 ; @entity45 6.5 , @entity46 6.5 , @entity47 6 , @entity48 6 ; @entity49 6.5 ; @entity50 7 , @entity51 ( @entity52 , 90 ) , camps 7 ( @entity53 , 83 ) , @entity54 6 ( @entity55 , 70 , 6 ) ; done 7.5 subs not used : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 goal : @entity1 12 @entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity62 7 ; @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 , @entity65 6 , @entity66 6.5 ; @entity67 6.5 ( @entity68 , 89 ) , @entity69 6 , @entity70 6 , @entity71 6 ; @entity72 6 , @entity73 6			1
subs not used : @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity67 , @entity79 booked : @entity67 , @entity72 referee : @entity81 attendance : 6,791 @entity3 chairman @entity83 hailed the win as ‘ fantastic ’			2
he added : ‘ it ’s what we ’re trying to do here , bring players through … because of illness and injuries we were down to the bare bones , but they all delivered			0
’ with @entity6 ’s form falling off a cliff over the past few months , they have dropped to 11th place in the championship and are now nine points off the play - offs			1
but @entity5 said : ‘ i ’m not a panicker			2
we ’ve been beaten today in a game where we had countless opportunities			0
we need to learn from that			0
and we need to be judged on where we are at the end of the season			0
’ while the result is not perhaps the most massive shock imaginable , given @entity6 ’s terrible form of late , @entity24 stressed there remains ‘ a massive gap in finance and quality ’ between the clubs , and thus rightly claimed that glory is due			2
manager @entity116 was too busy celebrating with his young squad to speak			0
a year ago @entity3 ’s third - round victims were the former champions of @entity120 , @entity121			1
this time is was the former champions of @entity124			0
the glory days of both seem long ago and @entity6 are enduring a woeful spell , with no win their last seven games and just two in 18 matches			2
‘ we gifted the opposition a soft goal , ’ added @entity5 when he spoke of the decisive penalty , awarded when referee @entity81 ruled that @entity6 ’s @entity131 had knocked over @entity45			1
‘ we dominated possession and had chances but our players did not take any clear cut opportunity			0
’ this was @entity3 ’s fifth @entity43 match of 2014 - 15 , having needed replays to beat @entity143 and @entity144			1
they are also in the thick of a promotion race in the third tier , lying just two points off the play - off places			0
@entity149 looks disappointed after @entity3 's right midfielder @entity1 slots his penalty past the @entity6 keeper in the first half at the other end of the field , @entity3 keeper @entity44 required medical attention after sustaining an injury in the first half of the match this run will increase their confidence and the coffers			1
they will pocket £ 67,000 in prize cash and could bank a further six figures with a major opponent and / or a tv game in the fourth round			1
they really should have earned more from the gate but @entity6 sold only 2,500 of their 3,500 ticket allocation			0
@entity6 had the first decent chance in the ninth minute when @entity174 was bought down to earn a free - kick			1
@entity70 curled the ball goalwards and it needed a smart punch from @entity44 to clear			0
but @entity3 were ahead three minutes later when 28 - year - old @entity1 converted the match - winning penalty			1
and had he shown more composure , @entity3 might have been two ahead , but he missed a sitter laid on by 19 - year - old @entity182 , one of @entity3 ’s home - grown players			2
forest ended the first half with two errors			0
one sloppy back - pass was pounced on by @entity189 who ran past @entity149 and was only stopped by a last - gasp block from @entity191			1
@entity70 ( centre ) of @entity6 battles for the ball during the first half at @entity11 , @entity3 @entity5 barks instructions to his @entity6 players , but was unable to get a result against @entity3 then a @entity70 back - pass was charged down by @entity200 , @entity62 ’s attempted clearance clattered into the oncoming player and the ball ballooned over the bar , just			1
done then set up @entity189 , but his header was saved			0
@entity6 were much better in the second half and pressed @entity3			1
by the end the home team were hanging on			0
but hang on they did			0
sometimes you do win with kids			0
the @entity3 programme pre-match shows the trophy everyone wants to lift ... but @entity116 's side will have to win plenty more to get there ' @entity218 to believe ' reads the message in the @entity3 tunnel ... the players heeded the message as they beat @entity6 1 - 0 at @entity11			1

@entity131 fouled @entity45 to give @entity3 an early penalty in the @entity43 third round
@entity1 fired the ball past @entity149 to open the scoring for @entity19 ' @entity228 from the spot
@entity5 's high - *flying* @entity6 , of the @entity231 , were unable to find a way back into the match
@entity3 , playing in their fifth @entity43 match of the season already , held on to to progress to the fourth round
