by @entity0 sci - fi fans who happened to glance skywards in central @entity3 on saturday night were surprised to see one of the most recognisable and enduring symbols in film and television history as a new star constellation			0
the symbol for @entity10 , the intergalactic starship armada from the @entity13 universe that counts the @entity14 among its numbers , was emblazoned across the sky above @entity17 , astonishing passers - by			1
the bold stunt was to promote @entity20 , the second movie of the re-booted franchise chronicling the adventures of captain @entity23 , @entity24 and lieutenant uhura			2
art group @entity42 and a @entity44 company called @entity45 launched the 30 @entity47 quadrotors near @entity3 's @entity17 and flew in a 94 - foot - tall formation to create the incredible sight			1
they hovered at between 118 and 426 feet above @entity50			0
the quadcopters , also known as unmanned aerial vehicles ( @entity53 ) , communicate with each other and ground controllers via a @entity57 transmission channel and have gps units to achieve the precise positioning			2
@entity60 , the final frontier : the 30 craft manoeuvre into position by the @entity3 landmark into darkness : the lights on the quadrotors dim to mark @entity68 the formation even rotated slowly , allowing @entity70 from all parts of the capital to see it			1
the stunt was held to coincide with @entity74 , where environmental advocates across the world switch lights off for an hour as a show of concern for the environment			1
in @entity3 it took place at 8.30pm on saturday			0
to coincide with the environmental theme , the batteries that powered the quadcopters were charged on the @entity85 renewable energy grid , according to event sponsor @entity86			2
to mark @entity74 , the @entity41 went dim along with the lights on @entity17 , the @entity90 , and the @entity91 , then turned on 60 minutes later			1
one of the 30 uavs that made up the illuminated @entity94 symbol state - of - the - art : some of the 30 led - equipped @entity47 quadcopters from @entity97 's @entity45 a technician works on one of the high - tech quadcopters the @entity53 hovered about 118 feet to 426 feet above @entity50 to form the @entity13 insignia a combination of controllers on the ground and sophisticated computer programming allowed the quadcopters to stay in formation tracking : global positioning technology was also used in the incredible marketing stunt in september @entity110 flew 50 quadrotors with pulsating , multicoloured lights in a synchronised display			1
uavs are deployed predominantly for military applications , but are now also used by non-military organisations , such as firefighters , police , and now marketing companies			0
@entity20 is released in may and stars @entity120 as captain @entity23 , @entity121 as @entity24 , @entity123 actor @entity122 as the villain and @entity125 as lieutenant commander dr. @entity127 ' @entity126			0
