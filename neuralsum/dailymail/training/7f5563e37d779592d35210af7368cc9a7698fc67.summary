by @entity0 a @entity2 man won a precedent - setting victory last year when the @entity5 @entity4 agreed with him that his floating home was a house , not a vessel covered by maritime law			1
but so far the ruling has n't helped him secure compensation for the home , which a city seized and destroyed using the laws that govern ships at sea			1
a judge refused in march to give homeowner @entity18 a single penny of the $ 25,000 bond posted by the city of @entity22 to pay for @entity18 's home in case he won			1
now @entity18 is seeking compensation through a separate civil rights lawsuit he filed in 2008 before another judge			2
the lawsuit claims that @entity22 city officials conspired to harass him and stifle his free speech rights - and eventually try to evict him from a city marina and destroy his home - because he vocally opposed a major private marina project pushed by the city			1
activist : @entity18 said the city seized his floating house in retaliation of him fighting against a land deal that would have given 2,200 private homes to a private developer a hearing is scheduled for late may on the lawsuit , and @entity18 has vowed not to let the matter drop			1
the lanky 52 - year - old who served in the @entity54 and made millions as a financial trader in @entity56 considers it his mission to fight what he considers government corruption and waste , documenting his efforts on his personal website			0
the @entity4 's 2013 ruling on his floating home was seen by legal experts as an important precedent in maritime law for thousands of other people who make their homes on the water as well as businesses such as floating casinos			1
different laws apply to vessels and homes , with homeowners receiving some protection from seizure under state laws in @entity2 and elsewhere			0
@entity18 's 57 - foot floating home was first unsuccessfully targeted by @entity22 for eviction from its marina			1
then , the city declared in 2009 it was a vessel and that @entity18 had to leave unless he could get it registered as such			2
eventually that dispute wound up in federal court , leading to the @entity4 ruling			0
when it came time to settle the $ 25,000 bond issue , @entity22 officials noted that the home sold for only $ 4,100 before it was destroyed			0
the winning bidder was the city itself			0
still , the officials said in court papers that @entity18 had ample opportunity to prevent its destruction , including bidding on it himself at an auction			0
' he should not be rewarded for a total loss that was completely avoidable , ' said @entity97 , one of the city 's attorneys , in a court document			0
dangerous : while trying to get @entity18 evicted from the marina , the city argued that his 10 - pound dachshund , @entity104 , was dangerous @entity106 - based @entity5 district judge @entity105 - who 'd previously sided with the city before the high court overturned the ruling decision - refused in march to give the bond money to @entity18			1
' this judge does n't decide the law of the land			0
the @entity4 does , ' @entity18 said in an interview			1
' it 's a slap in the face of the @entity4			2
' the battle now is joined before a different federal judge on @entity18 's civil rights lawsuit , in which he claims the @entity120 decided in a closed 2006 meeting to start a ' campaign of harassment and retaliation ' against him over the marina project dispute			1
that included , he says , his improper arrest while speaking at an open city council meeting , after which he was led out in handcuffs			0
@entity18 was charged with disorderly conduct , trespassing and resisting arrest without violence , but @entity136 prosecutors ultimately dropped the case			2
@entity18 seeks unspecified damages in the civil rights case , including compensation for his floating home			2
he also says he incurred $ 250,000 in legal fees and costs in the long appellate fight			0
the city contends he should again get nothing			0
its lawyers say there 's no evidence the city ever had a formal policy to harass or intimidate him and that it was @entity105 who approved the floating home 's sale and destruction			2
precedent : @entity18 's case set new precedent for centuries - old maritime law that reach far beyond his floating house ' a municipality should not be held liable for actions over which it was no control , ' the @entity22 attorneys said in court papers			1
a hearing is set for may 19 that will determine whether the case ends or proceeds to trial , which would take place in october			0
@entity18 is now living with his dog and cat on a larger , two - story floating home near @entity174 , but is determined to see through the case related to his previous dwelling			1
' a jury is going to need to determine the value of my floating home , ' he said .			0

@entity18 fought the city of @entity22 's plan to turn 2,200 private homes over to a private developer
he says that in retaliation , the city seized his floating house
@entity18 took the case all the way to the @entity4 - and won
@entity18 's was a precedent - setting case for centuries - old maritime law , with implications *stretching* far beyond his floating house
