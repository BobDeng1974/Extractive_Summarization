the @entity0 fought back from two goals down against their neighbours the @entity0 , to win a dramatic quarter - final 4 - 2			1
@entity6 ’s header eight minutes from time rounded off an astonishing comeback before @entity9 made the win certain late on in a game which saw six goals , and the woodwork struck twice , in a pulsating 36 - minute spell			1
after a dreadful first half , in which chances had been limited to hopeful long range efforts and a couple of scuffed shots , the @entity0 derby ignited after the break			1
@entity23 of the @entity0 's forward @entity24 ( c ) celebrates his goal in @entity26 @entity0 's @entity27 is all smiles as he finds the back of the net in a 4 - 2 goalfest there were signs of life from the first seconds of the second half , when @entity24 had a shout for a penalty turned down , and soon after the striker rattled the crossbar following an excellent knock - down from @entity9			1
but just as it looked as though @entity0 were beginning to take control of the game they fell apart			2
in the 54th minute @entity45 was given the freedom of the penalty box from a free kick , and he stabbed home to break the deadlock			2
a little more than five minutes later and @entity52 ’s side were two goals ahead , following some suicidal defending			1
@entity0 's coach @entity52 voices his opinions during the @entity56 game @entity0 forward @entity9 celebrates after a neat finish during the game in @entity26 first @entity59 gifted the ball to @entity61 , the tournament ’s top goalscorer , then @entity64 charged out of his goal for no reason			1
@entity27 fed @entity45 , who should have taken advantage to grab his second , but when his shot was blocked back to @entity72 , the former @entity70 striker made no mistake			1
in between the two goals the @entity76 had come close themselves , @entity74 curling a free kick beautifully onto the cross bar			0
@entity9 and @entity79 go flying as they compete for the ball in a hotly contested game and going a second goal behind seemed to galvanise them , @entity85 in particular finally finding his best form			0
the @entity88 winger produced some of the magic he has been showing in the @entity91 this season to bamboozle his fullback , before squaring it for @entity9 , who could n’t miss. suddenly the game was back on , and @entity0 were pushing forward at every opportunity			1
@entity98 , whose finishing had been woeful throughout should have converted a @entity9 knock - down , but fired wide of the far post			0
@entity0 fansget into the spirit of things as they cheer on their side but the chances continued to flow , and the 26 - year - old eventually managed to find the target			1
having seen yet another shot saved , @entity98 stayed alive with the ball still in the box , eventually swiveling on it and smashing home from 15 yards			0
it was a brilliant finish , and had he shown that level of quality earlier in the game @entity0 would have been out of sight			2
and the comeback was completed six minutes later when substitute @entity6 flicked a @entity85 free kick into the corner of the net			2
@entity0 fans put on a colourful affair as they watch their team in the @entity56 the extreme drama could not have been more unexpected after a drab first half			1
the two countries may share a border , a name and plenty of political disagreement , but the expected bite was entirely lacking from the an opening 45 minutes in which neither side seemed up for the challenge			0
@entity0 shaded the play , @entity98 scuffing two glorious chances , but the majority of the game was played at a pedestrian pace in the midfield , with long shots the order of the day			2
only @entity145 threatened to stir what crowd there was inside the stadium from their heat - induced slumber , the winger popping up all over the place to torment the opposition full - backs			0
@entity27 ( c ) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal during the 2015 @entity56 quarter final but on the other wing , the @entity76 talisman @entity85 was strangely subdued			0
aside from a man of the match performance in the first game , the @entity88 winger has not been able to make much of an impression on this tournament , and so it seemed to be proving again			0
that was until his side really needed him at two goals down , at which point @entity85 sprung into life			0
his two assists changed the game , and he had a good chance to seal the win himself before @entity9 wrapped up @entity0 ’s place in the semi final			0
it was the @entity178 ’s first win of the tournament , and will be their first semi-final since 1998			0
on this evidence , when their backs are against the wall , you would n’t write them off from going further			0
