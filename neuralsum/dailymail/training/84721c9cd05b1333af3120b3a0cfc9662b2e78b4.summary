dream role : @entity1 plays @entity2 there is no spanking to speak of , barely any bare , the merest whisper of a thrashing and only a snip of whip			1
perhaps we should expect no more and no less from the highly anticipated trailer to @entity2 , released across the world yesterday			1
with the full film adaptation of the @entity16 novel not due for release until @entity18 next year , this was the first tantalising glimpse of @entity1 as the heroine @entity2 and @entity20 as saturnine @entity2 , sado - masochistic master and all round good guy			1
and what of it ? well so far , so tepid			2
so very well mannered , my dears			2
yes , @entity27 appears to get his top off without delay and wanders inexplicably through several scenes like a scaffolder on a hot day , keen to show off his abs to any passing babes			1
the main thrust , if i may say , of the clip focuses on one of the most innocent , earliest scenes in the mummy porn novel , where gauche @entity41 in a terrible blouse and a tumbledown ponytail attempts to interview millionaire bigshot mr @entity44 in his chrome and steel power office			1
‘ i just have a coupla questions			2
do you have any interests out of work ? ’ she chirps , as he prowls around the room with a roll of masking tape poking out of his breast pocket while thwacking a riding crop into the palm of his hand			0
well , not quite , but we all know where this is going			0
mr @entity44 tells miss @entity66 that he does n’t want to talk about himself , he is much more interested in her			0
he fixes his penetrating gaze upon her , much in the manner of a golden eagle sizing up a tasty vole			0
before you know it , @entity41 is up in his helicopter and sitting on his glider – and i must report that these are real scenes , not euphemisms			1
they have a bit of a snog in a lift and @entity82 growls over the soundtrack as if she had a touch of flu and her big toe stuck in a door			0
the clip ends with @entity41 chained up at last in @entity27 ’s @entity89 , the sado - masochistic lair where carefully choreographed punishments and humiliations are to be carried out upon her person on a regular basis			0
well , they are in the book at least			0
in the trailer we last see her chained to the bed , a silk blindfold around her eyes and a smile playing on her lips			2
a smile that says … what ? that she got the role that every young actress in @entity111 wanted ? that everyone will have to wait until next year to see what happens next ? steamy : @entity20 as @entity2 and @entity1 as @entity2 in @entity2 raunchy : the trailer features glimpses of kinky love scenes between the couple the merest whisper of a thrashing : so far , so tepid			1
so very well mannered , says @entity122 whatever happens , surely this @entity111 adaptation can not be as bad as the books ; a trilogy of clumsily written teen - style , steamy fiction which @entity125 said made @entity131 look like @entity132			1
worryingly , the film has had a troubled inception , with a number of actors , directors , writers and key personnel all being changed at short notice			2
@entity142 screenwriter @entity141 was drafted in to beef up the script , while @entity144 was the chief director			0
after all , as @entity27 and @entity41 know , someone has always got to crack the whip .			0

fans of the *multi-million* selling @entity2 books were given a first glimpse of the film adaptation with the release of the official trailer yesterday . within a few hours the *montage* of scenes , based on the erotic novel about a pair of lovers who engage in *bondage* under contract , was *trending* on social media and had *amassed* *hundreds* of thousands of views on @entity164 . here @entity122 gives her *verdict* .
