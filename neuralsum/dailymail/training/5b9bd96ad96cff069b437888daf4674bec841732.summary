by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 one of the secrets of @entity4 ’s success – although not the biggest secret as it turns out - was that he was one of the lads			2
a cheeky @entity9 chappie and a tough - nut @entity11 fan , he invariably celebrated his triumphs as manager of world heavyweight champion @entity14 by enjoying a night out with the boys at one or other of those flesh - pots which are euphemistically known as gentlemen ’s clubs			2
the loyalty which is bred into most working - class road warriors was also fundamental to @entity4 ’s solid relationships with @entity14 and all the boxers in his stable			1
ecstasy : @entity4 ( right ) as @entity24 , reacts after managing @entity14 ( left ) to the @entity25 in 1997 living a lie : @entity4 ( left , last year ) admitted she has felt trapped in a man 's body since she was a child and ( right ) with a young @entity14 in 1989 winner : @entity4 ( front centre ) celebrates after @entity14 ( arms raised ) beat @entity33 for the @entity35 heavyweight title at @entity36 in 1992 belting : @entity4 ( right ) with @entity14 after the @entity38 beat @entity39 to win the @entity41 heavyweight title @entity4 was both a promoter and manager and the boxers he has worked with include ... @entity14 @entity44 @entity45 @entity46 @entity47 @entity48 @entity49 they trusted him , they felt safe confiding in him and some of them over-achieved because his belief in them never wavered			1
he managed and promoted them with a passionate machismo , fighting their corner as fiercely as they battled in the prize ring			0
so no , i did not see this coming and i will be surprised if anyone else did outside the very immediate family circle			0
@entity24 – or @entity66 as she now wishes to be known – is a good pal , an entertaining dinner companion , a boxing brain worth picking and will remain so			2
the @entity69 – as dubbed by legendary @entity71 promoter @entity70 during one of their feuds – always has been a character larger than that diminuitive stature			1
now that the @entity77 suit worn while working the corner of @entity14 and @entity47 on big world title fight nights has been exchanged for female attire that figure will become one of bizarre fascination , also			1
@entity4 ’s effervescent sense of humour will help cope with the curiosity , however morbid , and once the shock at the sex change has subsided she will chuckle along with the inevitable jokes which are already rife on the social media , the major concern will be the fall - out for those three beloved daughters from two marriages			2
glove story : @entity4 is best known for managing @entity14 , who rose to become world heavyweight champion as for @entity66 , @entity24 , the hide of a rhino developed in the concrete jungle of prize - fighting should deflect even the most wounding of the barbs			1
@entity4 was derided at first for bringing @entity14 back to his @entity9 birthplace from @entity107 , the country where he had spent most of his formative years and for which he had won his olympic gold medal			1
the mood in @entity41 changed as @entity4 ’s prediction that he was bringing home this country ’s first world heavyweight champion for more than a century began to look accurate			2
so persuasive was @entity4 that the @entity71 began to believe in @entity14 , also			1
so firmly that @entity121 – the same @entity122 who had dethroned the great @entity116 - preferred to dump his @entity118 belt in a dustbin rather than defend that cherished , linear title in @entity9			0
during their 12 years together @entity4 guided @entity14 onwards to the undisputed world championship and @entity125 is still the most recent heavyweight to hold that distinction			1
@entity4 ’s negotiating skills allied to the exceptional power and natural talent of @entity14 generated one of the most successful partnerships in the history of the @entity41 ring			1
their friendship survived their professional split in 2001			0
click here to read about @entity140 's decision @entity4 guided @entity47 to his first world title , at cruiserweight before the @entity143 took his swing at the heavyweight division , and also helped @entity146 and @entity147 to similar glory			1
there were dozens of @entity41 champions and @entity4 looked to be on the brink of helping another domestic heavyweight to a world belt until @entity44 suffered consecutive stoppage defeats by @entity71 @entity155 @entity4 had been against @entity44 rushing into that re-match and soon after , last october , the retirement announcement came : ‘ i ’ve fallen out of love with boxing and no longer feel i can continue to give it my best efforts			0
’ now we know there were other demons haunting one of the most popular personalities in the hardest game			0
perhaps , as @entity4 retreated with greater frequency from the family house in @entity170 to a second home in @entity172 , we might have suspected some kind of identity crisis			0
smile : @entity4 ( right ) with @entity41 cruiserweight @entity49 following his victory over @entity177 in 2012 team : @entity4 ( right ) with promoter @entity179 ( left ) and their client @entity146 in 2003 the power of three : @entity4 ( right ) , @entity179 ( left ) and the king of the promoters , the controversial and outspoken @entity71 @entity70 but , no , there was not even an inkling of trans - sexual feelings , gender re-orientation or hormone treatment in preparation for an operation			2
nor so much as a hint of uncomfortable behaviour at public or social occasions			0
when @entity4 was voted promoter of the @entity197 by the @entity198 - perhaps the most important of several individual accolades – i was invited to @entity201 to make the presentation and he was saluted with affection by many of the biggest names in the sport in the @entity71			0
the majority of what @entity4 called ‘ my special bond ’ with such domestic champions as @entity48 , the late @entity211 , @entity45 and @entity212 - ‘ they gave me some of my favourite nights in the ring ’ - survived a heart attack five years ago			0
now , as this 61 - year - old attempts to begin a new and very different life , more support is likely to be forthcoming from the tough world of boxing than @entity140 might imagine at this moment of revelation .			0

@entity4 announced that he is becoming a woman , @entity66
dubbed ' the @entity69 ' by @entity70 , @entity4 has always been a larger than life character
guided the likes of @entity14 and @entity47 to titles
