@entity2 details how @entity1 resolved to build schools in @entity63 after he became lost and wandered into a poor @entity65 village , then follows him as he expands his school - building efforts there			1

' in his first interview since 2011 , when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best - selling book @entity2 - author @entity1 has claimed that he did it because he was willing to ' kill himself ' to raise money for impoverished people			1
speaking to @entity43 's @entity127 , 56 , said that while he admitted to hearing the ' alarms ' over his 2006 work , he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects			2
famously claiming that he had met @entity79 , although she had died three years previously , @entity1 begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis - spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet			1

among many indescrepencies was mr @entity1 's account that he wandered lost into the village of @entity209 in @entity65 after trying to climb the world 's second - highest peak , @entity184 , then decided to build a school there			2

' dishonest ' : but critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and @entity1 , left , later admitted some facts were wrong			1
@entity231 suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath the investigation found that in many cases he was ‘ double - dipping , ’ where @entity60 paid for his travel to a speaking engagement and the host of the event also paid him a fee or honorarium for his travel , which @entity1 pocketed			2
@entity1 and his family also charged personal items to @entity60 in 2009 - 2010 amounting to $ 75,276 that included ‘ @entity332 clothing , @entity333 , luggage , luxurious accommodations and even vacations , ’ according to the report			0
