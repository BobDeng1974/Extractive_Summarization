click here for your ultimate stats zone from the big game , including @entity5 's full debut pitch map			0
all cup runs have to start somewhere			0
but if @entity9 go onto win the @entity11 this season , this drab stalemate in @entity8 will be lucky to make the commemorative dvd			2
as goalless draws go , this was pretty awful			0
but when @entity17 arrives back in @entity18 in the early hours of the morning , he 'll know it could have been so much worse			1
@entity9 striker @entity20 rattled the crossbar from a tight angle with a thunderous shot but it was the closest that @entity9 game to a goal in the first half @entity9 manager @entity17 shakes hand with @entity29 boss @entity28 ahead of his first game as a manager in full @entity33 competition @entity34 , who was booked in the first half for showing dissent to a linesman , is thrown off the ball by @entity29 's @entity39 @entity29 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity39 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49			1

subs not used : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73			0
referee : @entity75 ( @entity76 ) but for a 10 minute spell at the start of the game , @entity29 dominated this encounter without finding the goal their performance probably deserved			2
@entity17 made 10 changes from the side that started against @entity86 on saturday , @entity58 the only survivor from the 2 - 2 draw			1
there were full debuts for summer signings @entity5 and @entity66 , while @entity20 was handed another chance to impress ahead of @entity65 whose @entity9 career goes from bleak to virtually non-existent			1
speaking on wednesday night , @entity17 insisted the @entity11 remained a priority for @entity9 , despite his decision to leave behind a host of senior first - teamers for the trip to @entity99			1
it 's safe to say @entity9 fans need convincing , however ; just 150 making the trip to @entity8 for the encounter			2
but @entity20 very nearly gave them something to shout about inside the first minute , hitting the cross bar with a sharp angled shot after @entity29 failed to deal with @entity61 ' corner			1
it was a promising start for the visitors , who despite 10 changes , looked far from disjointed during the opening exchanges			0
click here for your ultimate stats zone from the big game , including this pitch map from @entity20 's disappointing first half left back @entity61 was given a start in @entity9 's first @entity11 game of the season and he did his best to get forward and boost his side 's attacking threat @entity34 reacted badly to a decision from the linesman and this dissent earned the @entity9 man a booking after failing to convert @entity9 's most clear - cut chance in the first half @entity20 became a peripheral figure , rarely getting the ball in front of goal slowly but surely though @entity29 , who have won all five of their @entity138 games this season , broke into their stride with @entity142 and @entity143 , in particular , causing @entity9 problems down the @entity8 ' right side			1
@entity49 saw his shot blocked by @entity5 in the 15th minute following excellent work from impressive right winger @entity44			0
@entity29 continued to find @entity9 ' left side a fruitful outlet as @entity61 struggled to make the desired impression on @entity17			1
the @entity153 manager took the decision to leave regular left - back @entity155 back in @entity18 ; you wondered if he regretted that given @entity61 difficult start last night			0
@entity34 tried to shift the flow of the game towards , but his trademark runs down the right were too few and far between for @entity17 's liking			2
@entity61 ' below - par display continued on 30 minutes when @entity44 once more eluded the @entity165 's attentions before picking out @entity48 at the back post , only for the @entity29 captain to blaze wildly over the bar			2
@entity34 needlessly earned himself a yellow card in the 34th minute for angrily remonstrating with one of the assistant referees after he was adjudged to have fouled @entity39			0
@entity66 , making his full debut for @entity9 in the centre of midfield , challenges for the ball with @entity29 's @entity46 @entity34 was constantly involved for @entity9 in their first @entity11 tie of the season but unable to have much of an impact in the final third at least someone in a @entity9 shirt was showing a semblance of passion , though			1
spurs did little to back up their manager 's claim the @entity11 would not be an after thought this season , centre - backs @entity5 and @entity190 the only two to produce a decent 45 minute display			2
the only crumb of comfort for @entity17 came in the fact that they were still on level terms , @entity58 making a good save from @entity47 in the final minute of the first half after a rapid @entity29 counter attack to ensure that was the case			1
it was all too slow from @entity9			0
no urgency , particularly in the attacking third			0
and it did n't get much better for the visitors after half - time as @entity29 continued to dominate proceedings			2
@entity9 defender @entity5 , who won the @entity11 last season with @entity207 , made his first start for @entity9 at centre back in @entity99 @entity211 midfielder @entity64 battles for the ball with @entity29 's @entity39 as @entity9 attempted to stamp some authority on the game , without much success @entity216 striker @entity65 came off the bench to try and give @entity9 some extra firepower but he shot wide with this acrobatic volley @entity61 nightmare continued three minutes after the restart as he received a booking for hauling down his chief tormentor @entity143 after the @entity224 beat him yet again			1
@entity58 was forced into another save in the 50th minute , comfortably holding @entity44 's shot after @entity49 's pass			0
the @entity229 no. 1 denied @entity44 yet again in then 60th minute , diving low down to his left to save the midfielder 's curling effort			0
spurs were n't improving , and their manager knew it			0
@entity62 struggles to get away from @entity29 's @entity45 as the @entity9 wide - man was denied time and space to show his attacking abilities @entity9 's @entity240 defender @entity190 keeps @entity43 off the ball but it was @entity29 who had the better of the chances in @entity99 @entity17 threw on @entity68 and @entity65 , who played alongside @entity20 in double - pronged attack , in an bid to change the complexion of proceedings			1
his move did n't have the desired effect , though , as the home side continued to poor forward in search of a winner			0
@entity48 sent a shot from outside the area over the bar before directing a diving header in the with 14 minutes left to play			0
@entity20 's 25 yard free - kick straight at @entity29 's wall in the 83rd minute summed up @entity9 ' night in an attacking sense			1
@entity58 was the busier of the two goalkeepers but in truth he was rarely stretched as @entity9 were held to a goalless draw in @entity99			1

@entity9 manager @entity17 managing for the first time in @entity33 competition
spurs unable to score against organized @entity29
@entity20 hits the crossbar early on for @entity9 but @entity58 is the busier of the goalkeepers
