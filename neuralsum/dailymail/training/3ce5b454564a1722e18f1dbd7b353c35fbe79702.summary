@entity0 has agreed to stop ' shaming ' @entity1 on its website when streaming speeds begin to slow , but are adamant that load times depend on the internet provider and not their service			1
the announcement comes after @entity1 sent the film and tv subscription service a cease - and - desist letter on thursday , concerning a loading screen message that said its network was ' crowded ' when videos failed to load immediately			1
@entity1 's lawyers said the notice could be detrimental to business and claimed @entity0 could not prove that its network was congested			1
but while @entity18 confirmed monday that the notices will stop appearing from june 16 , spokesman @entity17 played down that the decision was solely concerned with @entity1 's complaint			1
loading screen : the message displayed by @entity0 blames @entity1 for slow load times ' we do tests of different lengths ( of internet speed ) , ' @entity25 told the @entity30			1
' that does n't mean there wo n't be another one , and it does n't mean there wo n't be multiple ones that run in concert after this			0
' @entity0 said they were trying to help customers understand the performance of the broadband network they were subscribed to			1
in its monthly index for may , which ranks the streaming speeds of various carriers and was published by @entity47 , @entity0 noted that @entity1 had taken a strong dip in speed since april			1
it was in mid-may that the ' crowded ' messages first started appearing			2
' we pay some of the world ’s largest transit networks to deliver @entity0 video right to the front door of an @entity57 , ' a @entity0 spokesman told @entity58			0
' where the problem occurs is at that door — the interconnection point — when the broadband provider has n’t provided enough capacity to accommodate the traffic their customer requested			0
' telling : @entity0 has released its monthly index , which ranks the streaming speed of various internet providers			2
@entity0 said @entity1 has gotten much slower since april , with @entity1 saying they are busy upgrading their network so it will be faster ' this is about consumers not getting what they paid for from their broadband provider , ' added @entity0 spokesman @entity76			1
' we are trying to provide more transparency , just like we do with the @entity79 , and @entity1 is trying to shut down that discussion			0
' the deadline on @entity1 's cease - and - desist letter was set for tomorrow , june 10			1
in a recent interview with @entity84 , @entity1 's head of regulatory affairs , @entity85 , said the blame game was a ' moot point ' because the company is busy rolling out improvements to its network that will boost the speeds			2
he said any lag was the result ofa recent commercial agreement between @entity1 and @entity0 , which would give @entity1 users better access to the streaming site			2
' we ca n't just snap our fingers and the network is upgraded , ' said @entity85			0
' we need new facilities			0
' we have to do the equipment engineering			0
' build it and test it			0
' we are doing all of that right now			0
' and it should be completed during this year			0
