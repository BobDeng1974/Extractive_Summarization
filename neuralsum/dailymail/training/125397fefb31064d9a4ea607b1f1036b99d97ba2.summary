near - @entity12 asteroid 2007 @entity10 passed by on oct. 28 , 29 and 30			1
the asteroid 's distance from @entity12 on oct. 28 was 6.5 million miles ( 10 million kilometers ) , and 5.6 million miles ( 9 million kilometers ) on oct. 30 , and it made its closest approach on november 5th , coming within 17 times the @entity13 ( 4 million miles or 6.5 million kilometers )			1
this composite image of asteroid 2007 @entity10 was obtained using data taken by @entity4 's 230 - foot - wide ( 70 - meter ) @entity3 antenna at @entity5 , @entity6 @entity21 scientists chose to image asteroid 2007 @entity10 due to its size and relative proximity to @entity12 at the point of closest approach			1
the perspective in the images is similar to seeing the asteroid from above its north pole			0
each of the three images is shown at the same scale , @entity4 said			0
' the radar images of asteroid 2007 @entity10 indicate that it is an elongated , irregularly shaped object approximately one mile ( 1.6 kilometers ) wide , with ridges and perhaps craters			1
' the data also indicate that 2007 @entity10 rotates very slowly , roughly once every three to four days			2
' the trajectory of asteroid 2007 @entity10 is well understood			2
this flyby was the closest @entity12 approach by this asteroid for at least the next 200 years			0
although the orbit of 2007 @entity10 is well known and is not considered a threat to @entity12 in the near - term , it is classified as a ' near - @entity12 asteroid			1
' the images were taken as part of @entity4 's spaceguard project to watch for steroids and other objects that could hit earth the @entity5 observations are a part of @entity4 's @entity57 , or ' @entity58 , ' where objects are discovered , characterized and tracked			0
@entity58 identifies potential threats to our planet .			0
