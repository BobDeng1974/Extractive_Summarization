a stone knife found at a prehistoric gateway into @entity2 could force anthropologists to rewrite theories about how our human ancestors first arrived on the continent			2
archaeologists discovered the sharp stone tool at an ancient site on the @entity11 , to the east of @entity13 , on the @entity15 peninsula of @entity16			1
they believe the quartzite tool was made around 1.2 million years ago , meaning early humans were in the area far earlier than previously believed			1
archaeologists discovered the sharp stone tool at an ancient site on the @entity11 , to the east of @entity13 , on the @entity15 peninsula of @entity16			1
the sharp quartzite stone tool ( pictured ) is thought to have been shaped using a technique called hard hammer flaking sitting at the gateway between @entity27 and @entity2 , this could also mean scientists need to reassess how early humans entered @entity2			1
the earliest human remains to be discovered so far in @entity2 are 1.2 million - year - old bone fragments from the extinct @entity31 at @entity32 , @entity33			2
the spread of human ancestors has been a controversial subject and has led to competing theories of how humans evolved			0
@entity39 migrated out of @entity40 around 1.8 million years ago			1
by around 500,000 years ago it had vanished from @entity40 and much of @entity27 and was , until now , thought to have survived in @entity42 until as recently as 35,000 years ago			1
early modern humans reached the region about 40,000 years ago , and so were believed to have co-existed with their ancestors			2
but recent research suggests this assumption was wrong - and @entity39 disappeared long before the arrival of @entity49 in @entity27			2
excavations in @entity42 , however , indicate that @entity39 had gone extinct at least 143,000 years ago , and perhaps more than 550,000 years ago			2
another extinct species of human , called @entity31 , is thought to have been living in @entity32 , @entity33 , at least 1.2 million years ago			1
footprints attributed to @entity31 have also been found in @entity54 in @entity55			0
however , the discovery of stone tools in western @entity16 could mean that another species , @entity39 , whose remains have been found at sites nearby , could have also moved into @entity2 at around the same time			1
researchers from @entity63 , now believe the discovery of the stone tool supports claims that @entity15 was occupied by these human ancestors 1.2 million years ago			1
professor @entity68 , from the department of geography , said : ' this discovery is critical for establishing the timing and route of early human dispersal into @entity2			0
' our research suggests the flake is the earliest securely - dated artefact from @entity16 ever recorded and was dropped on the floodplain by an early hominin well over a million years ago			1
' the dating of the flake suggests that the maker would have been @entity39 , which is widely believed to have evolved in @entity40 and then spread into @entity83 by 2 million years			2
' there is also a partial skull of @entity39 from the site of @entity88 in @entity16 - this particular site has been re-dated several times , with dates from around half a million to just over a million years old , so the new evidence from the @entity92 really firms up our knowledge of chronology of early human occupation in @entity16			1
' @entity96 were probably the first early humans to live in hunter - gatherer groups			2
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity102 , used high - precision radioisotopic dating and palaeomagnetic measurements from lava flows above and below the sediment where the stone was found , at a site known as @entity110			0
this means the lava flows both pre-date and post-date the appearance of the ancient deposits from the river @entity11 where the tool was found			0
this allowed the researchers to establish that early humans were present in the area between approximately 1.24 million and 1.17 million years ago			1
previously , the oldest hominin fossils in western @entity16 were the skull fragments recovered in 2007 at @entity122 , in @entity15			1
the stone tool ( inset ) was found in the upper part of layer of @entity127 on the outcrop , just below @entity129			0
the earliest human remains found in @entity2 are 1.2 million - year - old bone fragments from the extinct @entity31 in @entity33			1
the discovery of this tool could mean @entity39 also moved into @entity2 at around the same time the stone tool was dropped in ancient river sediment at @entity110 around 1.2 million years ago , close to where skull fragments thought to belong to human ancestor @entity138 were discovered at @entity122 these fossilised remains are thought to be from @entity39 and were initially dated as being 510,000 years old			1
more recent research has revised this to being between 1.1 million and 1.3 million years old			0
however the age of other stone artefacts found with the remains were difficult to date			0
the discovery of the stone tool at @entity110 now supports the revised age for the skull fragments			2
speaking to @entity151 , professor @entity68 said : ' when the flake was struck , it would have had razor - sharp edges and presumably been used , as we know other flakes were , for cutting hides , meat or even plant materials			0
' there are a handful of sites in southern @entity2 - @entity33 , @entity163 and southern @entity164 - that have produced artefacts dating to around 1.2 million years			2
' however , the dating of these sites is very controversial in many cases , or the stone tools are not clearly associated with the dated deposits , which makes it difficult to make meaningful observations as to the timing and route of dispersal of early humans			0
' the key point regarding the new flake from @entity16 is that it comes from river sediments that are sandwiched between volcanic deposits , which can be securely dated using two very robust methods , @entity182 dating and palaeomagnetism			0
' @entity16 is an important area as a gateway to @entity2 so this is secure confirmation , for the first time , of early humans in this area			1
' the scientists said the stone tool showed no sign erosion that would suggest it had been transported by the river , leading them to conclude it had been dropped in sediment beside the river by whoever made it the world 's oldest stone tools are thought to be 2,600 sharp - edged flakes found in a dry riverbed of the @entity203 of @entity204 that date to around 2.6 million years ago			1
as these tools predate the oldest known @entity207 remains , it remains unknown who made them			0
however , fossilised bones bearing cut marks inflicted by stone tools have been discovered in @entity204 , and were dated at 3.4 million years old			0
this suggests that @entity214 - the same species as the human ancestor @entity216 - were using stone tools and eating meat			0
professor @entity68 added : ' the flake was an incredibly exciting find			0
' i had been studying the sediments in the meander bend and my eye was drawn to a pinkish stone on the surface			0
' when i turned it over for a better look , the features of a humanly - struck artefact were immediately apparent			0
' by working together with geologists and dating specialists , we have been able to put a secure chronology to this find and shed new light on the behaviour of our most distant ancestors			0

quartzite tool was made 1.2 million years ago by striking a hard rock
ancient tool was found west of @entity245 , on the @entity15 peninsula , @entity16
evidence supports claims early humans were in @entity15 peninsula at the time , after skull fragments from @entity39 were found at nearby site
those remains were previously thought to only be 500,000 years old
@entity15 peninsula provided an important gateway from @entity27 into @entity2
@entity259 suggests @entity39 may have entered @entity2 this way
