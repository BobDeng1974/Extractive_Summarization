fans stood on walls , climbed floodlight pylons and perched in trees			0
that was the day 43 years ago when little @entity5 took on mighty @entity6 in an @entity8 replay			1
a young @entity21 , on attachment from @entity10 to television outside broadcasts , made his way from @entity5 ’s @entity15 hotel , equidistant from the fine cathedral and the less august @entity18 ground , for what was expected to be a small end - of - programme clip			1
the top - tier deities duly went ahead seven minutes from time through @entity24 ’s header			2
but , moments later , @entity26 ’s right boot twanged the ball 30 yards into the top corner at the @entity29 for 1 - 1			1
it was as sweet a strike as the old @entity8 has known			1
@entity26 celebrates after scoring the late equaliser for @entity5 against @entity6 ‘ what a goal , what a goal , ’ exclaimed @entity21			1
’ the hero , wearing @entity37 , reeled away , both hands in the air			0
boys in green parkas and grown men waving black - and - white scarves flooded on to the muddy turf , where , in extra time , substitute @entity45 hit @entity5 ’s winner low into the far corner			1
the @entity50 no - hopers had done it			2
this weekend is @entity8 fifth - round time			1
but @entity5 will not be involved in the @entity8 or , indeed , any fixture			1
as of december 19 last year , the club , then playing in the @entity50 , was wound up by the @entity55 in @entity56			1
@entity5 fans invade the pitch after a famous @entity8 victory for the ages against @entity6 @entity5 goalscorers @entity45 ( right ) and @entity26 ( left ) beam after the game ninety years of existence in the lower reaches of @entity67 football had ended			1
today the @entity18 ground , in the centre of the city , is a crumbling relic			0
@entity72 is billed as ‘ @entity73 ’ but is now closed permanently			0
the @entity74 is similarly unused			0
an @entity76 piece of paper on the black door under the club badge announces that the ground , as of this month , has returned to its landlords , @entity82			2
with its corrugated fencing and lanky old floodlights , @entity18 contrasts with the soulless , recently - built shopping centre — comprising @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 — near the site of an old cattle market			2
peering through a gap in the @entity18 gates is @entity93 , a former art teacher			0
he and his wife @entity95 , from rural @entity94 40 miles away , were regular visitors here in @entity5 ’s footballing days			1
‘ we came for a day out , ’ said @entity93			0
‘ i would go to the football and @entity95 would go to the shops			0
then we would meet afterwards at five and go for a curry			0
what has happened here is bad , sad and mad			0
’ 43 years after their famous @entity8 victory against @entity6 , @entity5 went out of business on december 19 last year , @entity5 , then playing in the @entity50 , was wound up by the @entity55 on the off - white wall at the @entity29 written in red ink and capital letters are the words ‘ @entity110 ’ , which gets us into the nitty - gritty of this sorry tale			1
@entity114 was @entity5 ’s last owner			1
the club was wound up when , despite their lawyers claiming @entity117 could prove he had £ 1million to pay creditors led by @entity120 , he was unable to get to court because he was supposedly stuck in traffic			1
for all their @entity8 heroics , @entity5 always had less cash than cachet			1
but while @entity127 , the long - serving former manager , owned the club he turned a profit through good husbandry			1
@entity127 sold his majority shareholding to @entity132 , a local businessman , in 2010			0
from a position of solvency , the club made trading losses of about £ 1.5m over the next four years			2
the rot had set in			0
then , last may , @entity132 sold to @entity138 , an @entity139 businessman who was mistrusted by fans as the guardian of a club that is situated on prime city development land			2
he had a conviction for lorry theft that meant he was later barred under the @entity8 ’s owners ’ and directors ’ test			1
@entity5 has gone after 90 years in existence and the gates are locked at @entity18 so the club briefly fell into the hands of @entity153 , of @entity154			1
he was invisible , rarely if ever at games			0
he was soon succeeded by @entity138 ’s former adviser @entity114 , from the construction and waste disposal industries , who had previously been convicted of dumping waste illegally			0
by now the club were in a dire mess			2
off the field , they were expelled from the conference for failing to pay a £ 350,000 bond , while former manager @entity168 was suing them for unpaid wages			0
on the field , it was mayhem			0
unable to play in the @entity166 , they entered the @entity50 for the 2014 - 15 season , using 46 players in the five months prior to liquidation			2
some of the squad came from @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , all chasing the dream of a professional football career that was sold to them in an aggressive recruitment drive			0
they were paid sometimes as little as £ 50 or £ 60 a week , cash in hand			2
some even slept in the @entity192 function room			0
although @entity195 striker @entity194 , now at @entity196 , midfielder @entity197 , who joined @entity198 , and local boy @entity199 , who moved to @entity200 , found a life in football beyond @entity5 , many more players disappeared into the ether as quickly as they had appeared from nowhere			1
so what next ? @entity82 , themselves in debt , are committed — at least until the elections in may — to trying to resurrect the club at @entity18			2
@entity5 lost 2 - 0 to @entity209 in 2011 in the second - round of the @entity211 they have ‘ invited expressions of interest ’ to take on the tenancy , albeit only for two and a half years			1
the deadline for bidders is next thursday , with the @entity218 due to select who takes over the ground by march 1 , the @entity8 ’s deadline for participation next season			1
rumours in @entity5 say there could be three bidders , though only one is in the open : a 50 - 50 split between the @entity230 ’ @entity231 and a group of local businessman led by @entity234 , who made his money from polythene plant pots			1
@entity234 and his group say they are ready to commit £ 150,000			0
the @entity231 , whose membership of 1,700 makes their backing crucial to any bid prospering , have about £ 30,000 in the bank but say they could quickly raise more funds if the @entity218 chooses them			0
@entity245 , the @entity231 ’s vice-chairman , said : ‘ we are glad the last owners have gone			0
we do n’t see it as the end for football in @entity5			2
’ if the bruised supporters should succeed with a phoenix club , it will be called plain @entity253 and probably rejoin in the fifth tier of non-league football , the @entity256			2
‘ a lot of work needs to be done , but we are confident we can do it , ’ said @entity245			0
he and fellow fans can take inspiration from the old club ’s motto : ‘ our greatest glory lies not in never having fallen , but in rising when we fall			0

@entity5 , then a non-league club , beat mighty @entity6 in the @entity8
@entity26 and @entity45 scored in famous @entity8 upset
the cash - *strapped* club was wound up in the @entity55 in december
