by @entity1 reporter published : 08:21 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 08:36 est , 11 march 2014 a group of passengers who were stranded aboard a carnival cruise liner for five days last year as sewage ran along the hallways are suing for $ 5,000 a month for the rest of their lives			1
the lawsuit brought by 33 passengers of the ill - fated @entity13 voyage says they suffered mental anguish following the february 2013 ordeal and require the sum to cover medical bills			1
many claimed they suffer from @entity19 , anxiety and depression , while others have physical ailments from the ordeal , including leg pain , diarrhea , respiratory problems and aggravated hemorrhoids			1

trouble at sea : the @entity13 , pictured in february 2013 , became stranded in the @entity34 after an engine fire			1
now 33 passengers are hoping to get $ 5,000 a month for injuries they suffered the @entity13 was left without engine power , air conditioning or working toilets			1
passengers described scenes of human waste seeping into hallways , sleeping under makeshift tarps and no cooked food			2
a federal judge in @entity50 last week finished hearing three weeks of testimony from passengers and is expected to issue a judgment in the next two months			1
the lawsuit is the first from the @entity13 incident to go to trial , with others in preparation , according maritime lawyers			1
battle : @entity62 , one of the plaintiffs , said she has since experienced panic and anxiety attacks most of the passengers are seeking $ 5,000 in damages a year for the rest of their lives , claiming they will need medical monitoring because of the incident			1
they have said they want the money in lump sums based on government predictions estimating their life expectancies			0
one plaintiff , @entity62 , 59 , from @entity78 , @entity33 , said she suffered a urinary tract infection due to the cruise and has since experienced panic and anxiety attacks			2
' it was chaotic , ' she told @entity83			0
' people were in dire need of help			0
we were standing in line for food for five hours			0
' but in a statement @entity90 said that while it knows it was an uncomfortable experience , families returned safely and were given a full refund , a free future cruise and an additional $ 500 per person			1
' this is an opportunistic lawsuit brought by plaintiff 's counsel and plaintiffs who seek to make a money grab , ' a company spokeswoman said			2
carnival attorneys have asked senior @entity105 district judge @entity104 , who is hearing the case without a jury , to reject all of the damage claims , saying passengers have n't proved their health issues are linked to the cruise			1
others have failed to show any health problems at all , they say			0
plea : the passengers in the lawsuit claim they were left with mental anguish and physical ailments passengers aboard the stricken cruise liner detailed the horrifying conditions			1
@entity123 , passenger : ' toilets are overflowing in the cabins , we are having to sleep in the hallways			0
onion and cucumber sandwiches last night			0
cabin carpets are wet with urine			0
' @entity132 , whose wife was on board : ' no power , no water , having to use the bathroom in bags			0
' @entity139 , whose wife was on board : ' people are fighting over food and stuff - that 's a bunch of savages			0
' @entity146 reporting on his wife 's experience : ' we have no power at all , which means we ca n't use the toilets , wash our hands , or take a shower ' @entity154 , passenger : ' there 's no lights , no water , we ca n't flush			0
' @entity104 has already ruled that the engine fire is negligence on the part of @entity90 , a significant blow for the cruise line , according to @entity163 , a @entity29 maritime lawyer			1
' it would seem rather obvious that ships should n't just catch fire and then have fire suppression systems that do n't work , ' @entity163 said			0
carnival has since started a fleet - wide ' enhancement ' , including a major re-wiring of its engine rooms and improvements to fire safety and emergency power features , @entity83 reported			1
the cruise line also said it would repay the @entity105 government for the costs of responding to the stricken ship and another vessel , the @entity180			0
this latest case could change how cruise lines insulate themselves from legal actions , according to maritime legal experts			0
a second pending lawsuit with even more plaintiffs has the potential to further undo the advantageous legal position cruise lines have long enjoyed			0
cruise lines have successfully inoculated themselves against passenger lawsuits by printing stringent terms on tickets that require passengers to waive their right to a class - action lawsuit			2
relief : passengers finally arrive in @entity197 , @entity198 last year after being stranded at sea for five days the great escape : @entity201 kisses the ground after stepping off the cruise liner in @entity197 , @entity198 last year			2
numerous lawsuits have been brought against @entity90 in the aftermath of the ordeal @entity104 's ruling , which is expected to come in the next two months , could find the terms of conditions printed on the tickets , so - called ' contracts of adhesion , ' to be overreaching			1
the contracts have rankled some federal judges in southern @entity50 where several cruise lines are based , according to maritime lawyer , @entity216			2
the myriad cruise cases for relatively meager sums clogs their calendars , he said			0
one term of the ticket contract is that passengers can only bring their cases to the @entity225 of @entity50 and lawyers complain that people coming from other states to litigate is too costly for them .			2

the @entity13 became stranded in the @entity34 last year after an engine fire and passengers reported *disgusting* conditions on board
in just one of the lawsuits brought against @entity90 since the incident , 33 passengers are requiring $ 5,000 a month to cover medical bills
they say they suffered mental anguish and anxiety and a range of physical issues from respiratory problems to hemorrhoids
@entity50 judge will now rule on the suit in the next few weeks
