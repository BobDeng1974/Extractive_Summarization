by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 was the hero as the @entity3 launched their @entity5 qualifying campaign with a dramatic victory in @entity7			1
the @entity9 winger struck twice , the second of them in the 90th minute , to clinch a 2 - 1 win at the @entity14 @entity13 in @entity15 and earn the plaudits of both manager @entity17 and skipper @entity18			1
@entity17 said : ' he was the only player on the field that was scoring the goal			1
he really is a fantastic talent			0
get in there ! @entity2 celebrates his 90th minute winner that got @entity24 off to a perfect start stunning finish : @entity2 fooled a defender with a turn inside the box before curling home past the keeper ' he probably thinks at this age he should have been up there with the very finest players			1
he has that talent and he showed that tonight			0
' long - time team - mate @entity18 was equally effusive after seeing @entity2 , who had opened the scoring with 24 minutes gone , snatch the points at the death after turning on the edge of the penalty area and curling a delicious shot past substitute keeper @entity43			1
@entity18 said : ' if you score a goal like that , you deserve to win the game			1
if anyone else did that , the top players in the world , you would be talking about it for a long time			0
' the turn , the touch , the finish - only he could do that			0
no - one else on that field would have been able to do that			0
' @entity2 , who played under @entity17 during his time as @entity63 manager , had scored only three goals in his previous 69 appearances for his country			1
at the double : earlier in the match @entity2 finished off a move for his fourth international goal delight : @entity2 wheels away after scoring @entity24 's first before later going on to win the game for them his double in @entity15 in his manager ’s first competitive game - he also scored in the 62 - year - old ’s first friendly against @entity81 in november last year - increased his relatively meagre tally significantly , and the second of them proved priceless			1
@entity2 was applauded back into the away dressing room after conducting a series of interviews following the final whistle , and admitted he did not know what to do with himself			2
he said : ' i ’d been doing a few interviews outside while the manager was talking to the team about the game			2
i was a bit awkward when it happened , i did n’t know how to react really			0
' asked about his decisive strike , he added : ' the second goal was all about concentrating on my touch			2
i had my back to the goal , i just thought i ’d try something			2
it came off for me			0
' it does n’t happen very often for me , but thankfully it went in			0
' my boy : @entity17 shakes @entity2 's hand at full - time and he had some good words to say about him @entity2 ’s 24th - minute strike gave @entity24 an early advantage which was cancelled out in spectacular style by @entity114 seven minutes before half - time			1
the game looked to be heading for a draw until the @entity24 midfielder span and delivered the denouement to send the small band of travelling supporters into raptures			1
@entity17 said : ' we scored a goal got a goal in front , and we were at our most comfortable when they equalised			1
it changed the complexion and momentum of the game			2
there was moments in the second half when it might have been worrying for us , but we ’ve seen it through			0
' i think there ’s improvement in the team - we ’ve won away from home , which is terrific - but there ’s definitely improvement in the team			0
' our savour : the rest of the @entity24 team mob @entity2 after he struck to give them all three points in @entity15 for @entity7 boss @entity150 , a sixth successive defeat by @entity24 proved hard to accept			1
he said : ' @entity24 ’s second goal was the only moment of quality in the second half			2
perhaps a draw would have been a fair result and left both teams happy			0
' our performance is not what we want to see and we definitely want to see better games and results			0
we have limitations in the team and in @entity7 football in general - that is the reality we have to face			0
' we can not fault the players ’ effort and they stuck to task for 99 per cent of the time , but @entity24 have 25 players who play at the top level with most in the @entity172			2

@entity9 midfielder turned and shot to win the game for @entity24 late on
his 90th minute goal sent the travelling supporters wild in @entity15
@entity18 and @entity17 led the *tributes* to the *matchwinner*
the brace represented his fourth and fifth international goals
@entity2 's strike put @entity24 on the road to @entity189 with three points
