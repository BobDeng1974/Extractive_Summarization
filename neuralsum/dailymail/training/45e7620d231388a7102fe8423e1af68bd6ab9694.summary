it was almost seven o'clock in the evening by the time @entity2 arrived at @entity3 , but his reputation , as usual , had preceded him by several hours			1
' i know @entity2 and he will raise the temperature of this match , ' said @entity8 , earlier in the day , an unexpected reply to a question about the temperament of @entity12 , the 22 - year - old @entity13 midfielder			1
' even when it is hot out there on the turf , they must stay calm and cold			0
we ca n't afford any more yellow cards			0
' @entity2 said it is hard for @entity22 teams to compete in the @entity23 and compete at home @entity2 ( right ) leads his @entity26 players in training before the game against @entity29 striker @entity30 ( left ) is set to return to the @entity26 team for the first leg in @entity33 against @entity29 @entity2 fears that @entity30 ( centre ) is lacking in match sharpness because of his recent suspension @entity26 knocked @entity29 out of the @entity23 at the quarter - final stage of the competition last year @entity8 is keen to bill his team as outsiders , especially since his injury concerns deepened against @entity42 on saturday , as @entity26 enjoyed the weekend without a game , as they were out of the @entity44			1
the @entity29 manager had even gone as far as to hint they were happy to have lost against @entity47			1
he was in classic @entity2 territory , bemoaning weariness and how the other lot had it much easier , but the @entity26 boss switched his angle and claimed @entity30 would be lacking match sharpness			1
it was hard to find the mirrors in the smoke			0
@entity2 declined to answer @entity8 directly but teased about some of his pet subjects			1
such as , how it is easier to plan a @entity64 campaign if your domestic competition is a procession			1
' the last two @entity22 teams to win the @entity23 , @entity26 and @entity66 finished fifth , 25 points behind the champions , ' said @entity2 , although @entity26 actually finished sixth			1

' in @entity78 , for @entity77 it 's a promenade			0
in @entity80 they are waiting for @entity81 against @entity82 and @entity82 against @entity81 to decide which one is the champion			0
in @entity33 , @entity86 knows they are going to be champions even losing or drawing a few matches			0
' the last person to speak to about accumulation of matches and fatigue is a manager from an @entity22 club , because @entity22 is a special place			1
when the @entity33 players were on holidays at @entity99 , we were playing five matches in 10 days			2
' there was also a reminder , at a time when @entity8 's future is uncertain , that he rejected the chance to take control at @entity29 and has seen the masterplan			1
' i know the @entity29 project well because when they started , i was to be the coach , ' said @entity2			1
' i met them in @entity113			0
the project was to start dominating in @entity33 , to dominate in @entity64			2
@entity86 is a big team with big ambitions			0
' when @entity26 won the @entity23 in 2012 , they finished sixth in the @entity117 @entity29 manager @entity8 has said that he wants his team to ignore @entity2 's words @entity120 is available to play having been ineligible during last season 's clash with @entity29 @entity123 ( left ) has also joined @entity26 in what many consider a much stronger side from last year @entity126 ( left ) should feature for @entity26 and recently signed a new five - year deal with the club the slogan inside @entity29 's famous stadium is : ' @entity131 ' , and yet the mood is that they have taken a step back while @entity26 have progressed since the teams met last year			1
@entity2 has added @entity30 , the striker he felt he lacked when he played @entity137 up front in @entity86 and lost 3 - 1			2
@entity120 was not available in @entity64 last season , and there is @entity123 who has missed the last three games , but for 20 minutes against @entity142 , last week and is fighting illness to be fit today			2
then there is @entity126 , fresh from committing his long - term future to @entity26 by signing a contract until 2020			0

after signing last week , @entity126 said he was never going to leave			0
' he was always a good kid , ' said @entity2			2
' when a talent like him does n't sign a contract it 's normal to have speculation but nobody signs a five year contract without being convinced of his happiness			0
' in contrast , @entity29 have their injury crisis , discontent on the terraces and @entity8 is taking criticism personally			1
' i 'll take the responsibility for the negativity around the @entity42 game ( a 2 - 2 draw ) , ' said @entity8			2
' it was a catastrophe but , i 'm responsible			0

@entity171 , @entity186 and @entity187 have been ruled out and , although only @entity187 may have started , there was a depressed air which even the presence of @entity170 , with his sunny disposition and bright orange hoodie could not lift			0
