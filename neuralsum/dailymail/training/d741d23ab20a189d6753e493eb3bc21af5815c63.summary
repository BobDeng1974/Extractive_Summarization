@entity1 ’s 8,000 fans battled bravely to make their voices heard in the @entity3 but this is a @entity4 and @entity5 is ‘ only ’ 960 miles from @entity3			1
@entity7 fans outnumbered @entity1 3:1			1
still , at least they had a touch more local support than @entity10 , where @entity12 ’s comments before the @entity4 draw last year about not wanting to play in the @entity14 turned the @entity16 crowd against @entity1			1
loud and proud : @entity1 's contingent of fans in @entity3 were heavily outnumbered by the @entity7 it 's not just the @entity1 media which is obsessed with @entity21			1
when the team line - ups were announced , it was @entity21 who antagonised the @entity7 fans most , with deafening whistles all round			1
presumably it ’s better to be hated than ignored – it implies a threat			0
and some might say that obsession comes with the territory when you have an image rights ’ deal in the region of £ 100,000 a week and the star of a leading sportswear brand ’s tv commercials			0
lifeline : @entity21 tapped in @entity41 's cross to equalise for @entity1 @entity42 was the most enthusiastic anthem singer again			2
the rest of the team are still looking a little like kids in school assembly being made to sing hymns			0
@entity42 also ran to the corner of @entity1 fans at the start to rouse them , eliciting a huge roar , cementing his popularity as one of the most popular @entity1 players			2
he was also vocal in his displeasure that @entity57 had been allowed to sneak in between the @entity1 centre halves to score			2
@entity59 elated as @entity1 sit on the brink passion : @entity42 roars in the direction of @entity1 's fans after the national anthem it felt more like an autumnal day at @entity66 than a @entity16 @entity4 at the @entity67			1
the temperature had fallen to a decidedly cool 12 degrees with grey skies overhead there was the constant threat of cold drizzle			0
for those exposed in the temporary and uncovered stands at each end of the ground , the rain thankfully held off			0
despite the cold , there were disappointingly neither gloves nor snoods on show from the players			0
@entity84 : @entity3 @entity16 or @entity1 ? temperatures in @entity3 were in the low teens , but the rain held off @entity59 had a clear plan from the off – hassle @entity90 and @entity92 high up the pitch when @entity1 centre halves were in possession and disrupt @entity1 ’s passing from there			2
it was risky but it worked initially			0
@entity97 and @entity98 carried the burden of the workload and @entity90 and @entity92 consequently looked nervous and unsettled , a state of mind which carried over into their defensive duties			0
fight : @entity1 's centre backs @entity90 ( above ) and @entity92 were hassled all night			1

@entity59 beat @entity1 2 - 1 to all but end the @entity1 ' chances of *progressing* into the @entity4 2014 *knockout* stages
@entity57 scored two as the @entity111 *striker* terrorised @entity1 's defence
meanwhile @entity7 fans outnumbered @entity116 fans *significantly*
