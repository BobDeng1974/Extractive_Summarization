by @entity1 reporter published : 17:08 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 17:08 est , 15 june 2013 collector @entity2 suspected there was something extraordinary about a green rock he found in his backyard six years ago - but he had no idea it was out of this world			1
the @entity11 man recently received confirmation from @entity13 that the mud - covered rock he pulled out of the @entity16 , which runs behind his @entity18 home , was a segment of the @entity21			1
space rock : @entity18 resident @entity2 found a green rock from a nearby river six years ago which @entity13 confirmed was a piece of the @entity27 space station @entity21 out of this world : @entity18 resident @entity2 found this mud - covered rock in a river behind his house , and recently discovered it was a piece of a @entity27 space station after a year - long analysis , the space agency sent him a letter saying they were 87 per cent sure his rock was a remnant of the @entity39 spacecraft according to @entity40			1
@entity2 , a custodian at @entity41 , told the @entity42 he found the rock while searching for arrowheads near the river , and it stood out to him			1
' the river gets scoured really well by the ice in the wintertime , so you would n’t expect to find a small rock sitting on top of what ’s almost like pavement and granite , ' @entity2 said			2
' so i went over and picked it up			0
' he said the rock was a burnt shade of green with a distinctive glassy structure after he washed away the mud			0
one side had ' about a hundred tiny pores ' , most commonly seen in volcanic rock			0
using a metal detector , the unique item collector found that it had no traces of metal in it			0
not sure what to do with it , he left the rock outside for about five years until a friend came over and suggested it could be a meteor			0
not long later , his sister - in - law , a @entity77 teacher , saw the rock and sent it to @entity13 to be analyzed , according to the @entity42			2
after waiting about a year , @entity2 had given up hope of ever hearing anything about the mysterious rock			0
then a couple of weeks ago , he received a package in the mail from @entity13 containing his rock , a plaque and a letter from @entity13 analysis engineer @entity87 confirming that the rock had indeed fallen from space			1
the ' rock ' @entity2 found in a riverbed near his home was actually a chunk of the @entity21 , pictured the letter confirmed that while the rock originated on @entity95 , it had definitely been subjected to a fall from low @entity95 orbit , which was the reason for the rock ’s green color and strange properties , according to the @entity42			1
' the material shows a composition similar to that used as ballast by the soviet space program starting in the mid 1980s , ' @entity87 wrote			0
' this places its most likely origin as @entity21 , or one of the @entity110 @entity27 resupply vehicles , that had undergone a @entity113 failure			2
' @entity21 was a @entity27 space station that operated in low @entity115 from 1986 to 2001			1
when it fell to earth in march 2001 , most of it landed in the @entity119 .			0

@entity18 resident @entity2 found a green rock in a riverbed six years ago , and kept it in his yard
@entity13 *testing* revealed it is 87 per cent likely to be a piece of @entity27 space station @entity21
