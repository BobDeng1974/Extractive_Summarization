problem : @entity2 teens have some of the highest rates of binge drinking in the developed world @entity2 teenagers have the highest rates of drug and alcohol abuse in the developed world			1
and they are far more likely to be killed by violence than peers in @entity12			1
this lost generation , whose unemployment rate is 20 percent , leads the modern world in some of the most dangerous and irresponsible behaviors , according to a new study released by the @entity21 medical journal			1
the shocking data was released to highlight cultural neglect occurring in the adolescents and young adults -- too many of whom die young , according to the researchers behind the publication			1
not all the news is bad			1
@entity2 teens appear to have the highest rates of exercise in the developed world			1
despite this , @entity2 teens , age 13 to 15 are dramatically more likely to be overweight , leading the western world , according to the data			1
among the most startling discoveries of the @entity21 data is how much higher the rates of teen violent death are in the @entity2 than the rest of the developed world			1
about 17 in 100,000 teen boys age 15 to 19 are killed by violence			1
the next two closest countries are @entity44 and @entity45 , with four			1
@entity47 's rate is just one			1
the teen drinking statistics come with an important caveat			1
some 30 percent of @entity2 13 to 15 year - old - girls reported binge drinking in the last 30 days -- more than any other developed country			1
however , several nations -- among them @entity47 -- were not included in the data			1
@entity47 has the third highest proportion of sexually active teenagers in the world as well as some of the worst levels of harmful underage drinking			1
the research found that sexual activity among 13 to 15 - year - olds was highest among girls in @entity63 followed by @entity64 , the @entity47 and @entity65			1
@entity68 and @entity63 had the highest rates among boys			1
the lowest rates in boys were in @entity73 , and for girls @entity44			2
@entity2 rates of young teen sex were about average for the developed world , with about 25 percent of boys and 26 percent of girls saying they had sex before age 15			2
boys in the @entity2 , age 15 to 19 , are more than four times more likely to be killed by violence than the next-most violent industrialized country			2
here is the list of the @entity90 nations with the highest rates of violent death per 100,000 teens : 1			2
@entity65 -- 2 * @entity47 -- 1 @entity98 had the fourth highest percentage of youngsters who have been drunk by the age of 13 in a league table of 40 mostly high income countries			1
@entity104 was fifth and @entity106 eighth			2
@entity104 was third for those drinking weekly at the age of 15 , with @entity98 fourth and @entity106 again eighth			1
the figures are taken from 2006 , the last year with internationally comparable data , with new estimates in the coming months set to provide an opportunity for the @entity47 to assess whether policies to reduce harmful drinking among teenagers have had any impact over the past five years			1
teenagers ' general well being has improved far less over the last 50 years than that of children under 10 with evidence suggesting adolescence is not the healthiest time of life , as is often assumed			2
a lack of focus on adolescent health could be described as a ' missing link ' in the approach to health , an international team of scientists warn			2
the statistics are revealed in two studies by professor @entity136 , of the @entity137 in @entity138 , and colleagues which was published in @entity141 on @entity142			2
the first paper says even the explosion in social media such as @entity146 and @entity147 has both good and bad points for young people			2
while it enables them to be catalysts for community change , as happened in the uprisings of the @entity155 and @entity156 , it also exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying , and sexting , the act of sending sexually explicit or pornographic messages by mobile phone			1
there are now some 1.8 billion adolescents aged between ten and 24 in the world today , comprising more than a quarter of the population			2
peer pressure : statistics published in the medical journal the @entity21 show that youngsters are more at risk from drug taking and sexually transmitted diseases than ever before teen girls in the @entity2 have the highest rates of binge drinking in the developed world , according to the survey			1
it should be noted , however , that the results for several nations were not included in the survey -- most importantly , @entity47			2
the following is data shows the percentage of girls , age 13 to 15 , who reported binge drinking at least once in the last 30 days : 1			1
@entity2 -- 30 percent 2			2
@entity95 -- 29 percent 3			2
@entity190 -- 28 percent 4			2
@entity64 -- 26 percent 5			0
@entity191 -- 21 percent 6			0
@entity45 -- 16 percent 7			0
@entity192 -- 13 percent 8			0
@entity193 -- 12 percent the researchers said with longer periods in education , and significant delays to marriage or settling down , the period during which young people are exposed to the risks of adolescence has extended significantly			1
such behaviours include harmful alcohol consumption and illicit drug use with peers , and sex with more casual partners , increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections			1
prof @entity136 said : ' the present generation of young people will take a different path through adolescence from previous generations and will face new challenges to their health and well - being along the way			0
' programmes to promote maternal , newborn and child health across countries of all incomes have led to more children surviving and the current adolescent population boom , known as the ' youth bulge '			0
over the same period digital media , industrialisation , globalisation and urbanisation have changed traditional family and community influences , resulting in less ' social scaffolding ' of adolescents			0
the researchers said many health - related behaviours that usually start in adolescence such as smoking and drinking , obesity and physical inactivity contribute to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases including heart disease , cancer , diabetes and lung disease			1
new threat : the explosion in social media exposes adolescents to new risks such as cyber-bullying more @entity2 boys age 13 to 15 say they get more than an hour of exercise per week than teens in any over developed nation			1
@entity2 -- 35 percent 2			0
@entity94 -- 31 percent 3			0
@entity258 -- 28 percent 4			0
@entity190 - 27 percent 5			0
@entity95 -- 27 percent 6			0
@entity73 -- 24 percent 8			0
@entity259 -- 24 percent 9			0
@entity64 -- 24 percent 10			0
@entity44 -- 24 percent 11			0
@entity260 -- 24 percent 12			0
@entity47 -- 24 percent studies on adolescent brains suggest they are more affected than adults by exciting or stressful situations when making decisions			0
increased activity in the nucleus accumbens , a reward and pleasure centre , appears linked to this			0
while the death rate among under fives has declined by 80 per cent or more in many countries in the past fifty years , adolescent mortality has only marginally improved			0
the major causes of disability - adjusted life years ( @entity282 ) , a measure that combines burden of mortality and disease , in adolescents are alcohol use ( seven per cent ) , unsafe sex ( four per cent ) , iron deficiency ( three per cent ) , lack of contraception ( two per cent ) and drugs abuse ( two per cent )			0
prof @entity136 said : ' irrespective of region , most adolescent deaths are preventable and thus strongly justify worldwide action to enhance adolescent health			0
' in view of their dynamic and challenging health profile , the contribution of adolescent health to the global burden of disease , and the important effect of adolescents and their health across the life course , adolescents should be more prominent within future global public health policies and programming			0
' the second paper revealed the @entity47 had the fifteenth lowest rate for adolescent mortality in a league of 27 high income countries			0
the @entity47 was also mid ranking for both boys and girls in cannabis use			0
surprisingly , despite its obesity epidemic , boys aged 13 to 15 in the @entity2 exercised more than boys in any other of the 16 countries reporting data , and @entity2 girls had the second highest levels of exercise behind @entity95 , which was in second place for boys			0
the @entity47 finished eighth best for girls in the amount of exercise they did , and fifth best for boys out of sixteen countries reporting data			0
prof @entity136 added : ' for the largest generation in the world 's history , the available global profile of youth health is worrying			0

youngsters ' more at risk from binge drinking , drug taking and @entity343 than ever before '
@entity21 report identifies new risks including cyber-bullying and ' sexting '
