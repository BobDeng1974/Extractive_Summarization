a man has gone to drastic measures to do away with his headphones - by having small magnets implanted directly into his ears			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , is a ‘ bodyhacker ’ or ‘ grinder ’ – a person who experiments with surgical implants			2
in his latest stunt , he embedded small magnets into his tragus – a small piece of cartilage just outside the ear – and built a coil to be worn around his neck			1
he claims that this creates a magnetic field that causes the implant to vibrate and make a sound			1
he wears a coil around his neck ( pictured ) which creates a magnetic field which causes the implant to vibrate and make a sound to listen to music , mr @entity5 has to plug his phone into a tiny amplifier which is connected to the coil around his neck to create a magnetic field			1

this magnetic field causes the magnets in his ears to create sound which only he can hear			1
he admits that the sound quality is not nearly as good as it would be using traditional headphones			0

mr @entity5 admits that the sound quality is not nearly as good as it would be using traditional headphones			1
however , he says there are numerous advantages – he can listen to music anytime , anywhere , and the implants are also invisible to the naked eye			2
writing in the magazine humanity + mr @entity5 said : ‘ having stuff like this done is n’t really the realm of doctors			2
‘ most grinders rely on body modification artists to install their implants			0
i ’ve had work done by the body modification master @entity74 in the past and have relied on him for advice on several project ideas			0
‘ @entity74 instinctively knew the best way to go about the implantation in a way that would minimise chances for infection and would leave no scarring			0
the implant procedure itself went very smoothly and the pain was surprisingly minimal			0
’ he went on to explain that he had numerous plans for the use of the device			0
he hopes to hook it up to the gps on his phone so that it can give him directions as he is walking around			2
he also intends to connect it to a directional microphone in a shirt button so that he can hear conversations across a room			1
mr @entity5 also plans to link the implants up to an ultrasonic rangefinder so that it hums when he gets closer to an object			2
the implant is placed in his tragus ( pictured ) - the small piece of cartilage just outside the ear			1
he can listen to music through the implant but also hopes to connect it to @entity93 so it can give him directions he believes that this would give him a sense of echolocation similar to that of a bat and he thinks that this invention could eventually be useful for people who are blind			1
mr @entity5 says that this project is particularly important to him as he fears that he may lose his sight			2
he wrote : ‘ @entity124 is something i want to start practicing with now because i might be legally blind soon			0
‘ i lost much of vision in my right eye overnight a few years back			0
i just woke up and could n’t see well up close or far away			0
‘ my other eye has compensated for the vision loss but the doc says the good eye can go at any time and when it does it will be very rapid			0
i ’ll lose my driver ’s licence , wo n’t be able to read , and glasses wo n’t correct the problem			0
‘ so i figure learning to navigate with echolocation is a good thing to develop now , not that i ’ve resigned myself to blindness or anything			0
’ finally , mr @entity5 says that he is considering connecting the device to a @entity143 counter so that he can ‘ experience the world of radiation ’			0

@entity5 had small magnets implanted into the cartilage near his ears
also built a coil to wear around his neck - he says this creates a magnetic field that causes the implant to vibrate and make a sound
can listen to music but also hopes to connect it to @entity93 so it gives him directions , and to link it to a microphone so he can hear other people *'s* conversations
