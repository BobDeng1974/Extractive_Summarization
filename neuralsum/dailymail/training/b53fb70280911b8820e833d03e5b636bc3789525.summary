by @entity0 published : 18:48 est , 25 november 2013 updated : 19:37 est , 25 november 2013 the couple accused of keeping three women as slaves for 30 years ran a @entity5 sect in the 1970s that recruited young female foreign students			1
@entity8 and his wife @entity9 were said to have put their followers under a ‘ spell ’			1
the pair were arrested last week after three women , who had allegedly suffered years of abuse , were rescued from a flat in @entity15			1
they called him @entity8 and their revolutionary cry was ‘ death to the @entity18 fascist state ! ’ their base was a converted bookshop in @entity15 , @entity24 , where he and his followers would spread their @entity28 poison and hatch plots against the @entity30			1
the @entity32 sect that comrade @entity8 and his wife @entity9 ran was called @entity35 - @entity34 , an obscure political faction formed in the 1970s			1
adopted as a baby , this is one of many pictures ' @entity38 ' sent from ' captivity ' to her neighbour , @entity41 only a handful of people ever belonged to it – but the band of like - minded activists and fanatics proudly proclaimed the world would soon be liberated from capitalist oppression by the @entity50			0
if it sounds like an episode of the classic tv series @entity55 , in which @entity56 played the leader of the @entity55 , it is not a coincidence			1
@entity8 ’s group was the inspiration for the comedy series that featured @entity55 and his @entity63 dream , penned by the writer of @entity65 and screened for three years from 1977			1
reality , however , may have been far more sinister			0
for @entity8 and his wife @entity9 are currently at the centre of police investigations into allegations that three women had been held captive as slaves for the last 30 years			1
@entity8 – a short , bald 73 - year - old called @entity8 , and his 67 - year - old wife @entity9 , apparently known as ‘ mrs @entity72 ’ , were arrested last week after it was alleged the women suffered years of physical and mental abuse at the couple ’s succession of addresses around @entity15			1
a 57 - year - old @entity82 woman and a 69 - year - old @entity84 woman were said to have suffered years of ‘ physical and mental abuse ’			0
another , @entity38 , 30 , was adopted as a baby by the couple after her real parents died in a fire			2
this site in @entity15 was once the headquarters of the @entity92 - which housed a communist collective run by the slavery case suspects - reportedly @entity8 , 73 , and his wife @entity9 , 67 it emerged at the weekend she had been sending love letters to her neighbour , @entity41 , 26 , describing her suffering and despair at being held captive in the @entity15 council flat for more than 30 years			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have now been bailed but are currently unable to return to their home			1
the pair , of @entity107 and @entity108 origin , came to @entity18 in the 1960s			0
the @entity5 inspired ‘ collective ’ they ran in the 1970s is understood now to be under investigation to establish any bearing it might have on the current case			1
the sect 's idol - @entity113 's chairman @entity112 it was formed in 1974 after @entity8 , who studied economics and became deeply immersed in radical politics , broke away from an @entity119 branch of the @entity120 to form his @entity122 group			1
the executive threw him out for ‘ conspiratorial activities ’ , according to a party report at the time			0
his faction members had ‘ attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party ’			0
the so - called workers ’ @entity132 he went on to create was based at the @entity92 in @entity133 , @entity15 , a bookshop that is now an ( unconnected ) @entity136 restaurant			1
the centre , named in memory of ‘ our beloved chairman ’ , operated as a commune , reportedly with 13 of its 25 members living there			0
at least six were engaged in what was described as full - time revolutionary work			0
the centre had its own library and published a weekly journal , the @entity150			0
the group is said to have encouraged women to take a leading role in political organisation and structure			2
described as a ‘ guru ’ , @entity8 was clearly a powerful figure at the head of a band of devoted female followers effectively under his spell , or at least in his awe			1
many were persuaded to give up their studies in order to ‘ integrate with the working class ’ and carry out ‘ revolutionary work ’			0
by day the centre was the group ’s administrative head office			2
most evenings the institute ran lecture sessions and political film presentations			2
@entity8 would educate followers in his politics and tell them regularly what was wrong with the capitalist society of his adopted country			2
printed leaflets called for the working classes to unite to bring down capitalism in @entity18			0
such were the bizarre outpourings of what was labelled a ‘ lunatic fringe ’ that @entity186 – viewed by the group as the @entity30 tool of the bourgeoisie – reprinted some of its material in waspish diary items			2
had the newspaper not done so , perhaps , the commune might never have come to public attention			0
another of the pictures of @entity38 - who was captive by ' evil monsters ' in a ' dark dungeon ' of a council house for more than three decades - and who wrote many letters to a neighbour letters sent to @entity41 from ' @entity38 ' one of the three women held captive in @entity15 but it was already under scrutiny by @entity209 and @entity210 – and shortly after dawn on march 22 , 1978 , police swooped on the institute to make 14 arrests , among them @entity215 and @entity216			1
critics branded it the oppression of the fascist police state , and complained that some of the 200 officers with dogs and riot shields had assaulted the occupants and racially abused them			0
the centre was subsequently shut down , the organisation went underground and of course , the @entity50 never invaded			0
it is understood some of the women who were part of the original commune later moved with the couple to various addresses in @entity24			1
however , the sect may have helped to spread the message			2
a year before @entity8 formalised his organisation – at a time when he was already plotting his breakaway movement – extremists who identified themselves as a @entity242 stormed a @entity244 lecture and attacked the speaker			2
investigation : police stand guard at the property in @entity15 , south @entity24 , and are following many lines of inquiry including links to 13 addresses across @entity24 professor @entity254 , author of a controversial paperback entitled ‘ @entity264 ’ was punched and bundled off the stage by around 20 people , some of whom snatched the microphone and gave a lecture instead on the evils of fascism			1
it is not clear whether the 20 were connected to @entity8 – but it was perhaps an indication of the ideals held by those who shared his views			2
a speech he later delivered gives a flavour			0
he talks about ‘ upholding the revolutionary traditions of our martyrs ’ to ‘ defeat revisionism and counter the attacks of the @entity18 fascist state ’			0
he added : ‘ dare to think , dare to speak , dare to act			0
it is right to rebel against reactionaries			0
only thus can you be genuine soldiers of beloved chairman @entity112 and undertake revolutionary work which has never been done before			0
’ @entity285 professor @entity284 described the @entity15 sect yesterday as ‘ a tiny , very tight knit group ’ that was ‘ clearly under the spell ’ of comrade @entity8			1
in his research for a 1979 thesis , professor @entity284 said @entity8 was able to exercise control by ‘ his superior ability to manipulate the oracles ’ , disciplining those who challenged his power			2
his group of mainly young overseas female students – including two from @entity84 , four from @entity113 , one from the @entity301 and three @entity302 – seemed to have ‘ difficulty adjusting to life in the @entity18 ’ and maintained a ‘ hostile attitude ’ towards the @entity30			2
he said the group ’s ideology was ‘ profoundly detached from reality ’ – a description , perhaps , that might easily have been applied to @entity55 and his ‘ @entity313 ’ plans for @entity312			1
but there was an important difference			0
@entity8 ’s group was scathing of ‘ so - called revolutionaries who spend their time talking in pubs ’ – which is precisely what @entity55 did			1
and its ambition to bring ‘ death to the @entity18 fascist state ’ was fact , not fiction			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
