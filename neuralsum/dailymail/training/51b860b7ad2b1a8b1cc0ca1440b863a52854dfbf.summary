@entity0 joined @entity1 in making a painful first - round exit from the @entity3 after falling to @entity4			0
after pre-tournament favourite @entity1 's tumble to @entity7 on monday , the loss of @entity0 on tuesday evening caused a further major stir and was accompanied by the afternoon exit of four - time world champion @entity10			0
@entity0 lost 5 - 2 to @entity11 , an ever - eager showman who at the age of 42 is still playing a mean game , as was demonstrated in his run to the @entity18 quarter - finals earlier this year			2
shock : @entity0 was unable to find his best form after a good start against @entity4 a break of 100 nudged @entity0 into a 2 - 1 lead , but @entity4 held the upper hand thereafter , with runs of 57 , 103 and 95 spurring him to a last - 16 place			1
out : the world no 6 made a century break in the third frame but was then overwhelmed by @entity4 @entity10 was an arguably more predictable casualty as the 39 - year - old fell 5 - 4 to @entity32 , another @entity11 having a fine day in @entity33			1
day had trailed 4 - 2 but breaks of 55 , 102 and 77 in successive frames saw the 34 - year - old @entity37 potter get the better of the struggling @entity38 , who has not reached a major semi-final for over a year			0
the long - time standard - bearer for snooker in @entity43 , two - time @entity18 winner @entity40 , also came through a stiff test as he fended off the 2013 @entity47 runner - up @entity45 , pinching the decider to win 5 - 4 after his @entity50 - based opponent ploughed in 144 in the eighth frame			0
in form : @entity11 won four frames in a row to come from 2 - 1 behind to win the match under the cosh : @entity10 also crashed out in a first round which was full of upsets @entity60 set up a first - round clash with reigning world champion @entity62 after beating @entity33 amateur @entity63 5 - 3 in their wild - card tussle			1
@entity33 's leading light @entity67 began his campaign with a promising 5 - 1 win over @entity71 @entity70 , the highlight being his break of 128 in the fifth frame , while @entity75 and @entity76 were also victors on the second day of the week - long ranking tournament , which carries a first prize of Â£ 85,000 .			2
