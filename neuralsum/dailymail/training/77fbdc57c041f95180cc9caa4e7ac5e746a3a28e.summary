by @entity0 published : 03:36 est , 21 september 2012 updated : 03:36 est , 21 september 2012 early man : without an adaptation which allowed us to process vegetables , modern man 's brain may have remained under - developed modern humans were able to emerge from @entity8 after a genetic mutation allowed them to become vegetarian , a new study claims			1
the change meant humans were able to move away from water sources and spread across the continent			0
geneticists have compared dna sequences from numerous people around the world to determine how different populations relate to one another and when they might have gone their separate ways			0
now three teams of @entity25 scientists have found that a key genetic variant was the ability to convert fats from plants into necessary nutrients for the brain			2
the development would have allowed early humans to leave the waters of @entity8 , where they ate fish , according to the study published online on the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
researchers from the @entity40 in @entity41 , the @entity42 in @entity43 and the @entity44 , @entity45 , analysed the genes of 1,092 individuals from 15 different human populations			0
they claim homo sapiens first appeared 180,000 years ago , but stayed in one location around bodies of water in central @entity8 for almost 100,000 years			0
senior author doctor @entity53 , professor of physiology and pharmacology and director of the @entity57 and @entity58 at @entity40 , said the location was critical as the ready supply of fish and shellfish provided the fatty acid @entity63 ( @entity63 ) , which was necessary for brain development			2
' this may have kept early humans tethered to the water in @entity8 where there was a constant food source of @entity63 , ' he said			1
' there has been considerable debate on how early humans were able to obtain sufficient @entity63 necessary to maintain brain size and complexity			1
' it 's amazing to think we may have uncovered the region of genetic variation that arose about the time that early humans moved out of this central region in what has been called the ' great expansion			2
' varied diet : two members of the @entity85 tribe use bows in @entity86 to fish , following the tradition of their ancestors this conversion meant that early humans did n't have to rely on just one food source , fish , for brain growth and development			1
according to @entity94 , lead scientist at the @entity44 , the development was particularly important because the genetic variant arose before organised hunting and fishing could have provided more reliable sources of the necessary fats			0
' the power of genetics continually impresses me , and i find it remarkable that we can make inferences about things that happened tens of thousands of years ago by studying patterns of genetic variation that exist in contemporary populations , ' he added			0
the researchers said the findings added to a study in 2011 which found people of @entity115 descent have a much higher frequency of the gene that converts plant - based fatty acids to polyunsaturated fats that cause inflammation			2
compared to @entity123 , @entity122 in the @entity25 have much higher rates of hypertension , type 2 diabetes , stroke , coronary heart disease and certain types of cancer			0
' the current observation provides another important clue as to why diverse racial and ethnic populations likely respond differently to the modern western diet , ' dr @entity53 said .			1

adapting to a part - vegetarian diet helped early humans lose their *dependence* on fish
genetic study *suggests* plant fats *accelerated* development of the brain , and allowed mass - *emigration* from @entity8
findings ' may *explain* why diverse racial and ethnic populations respond differently to the modern western diet '
