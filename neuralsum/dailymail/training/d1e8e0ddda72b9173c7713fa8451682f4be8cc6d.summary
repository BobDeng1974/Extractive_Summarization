by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 06:23 est , 6 october 2012 @entity2 rules coming from the @entity3 threaten to plunge @entity4 into 1970s - style blackouts in three years and lead to energy bills doubling			1
millions could be pushed into fuel poverty – having to choose between heating or eating – because @entity13 diktats are closing power stations needlessly , the government ’s energy regulator warned yesterday			2
the plants that remain in @entity4 will not be able to keep up with demand by winter 2015 , a dire report from @entity16 predicted			1
@entity20 power station : the station will close in 2013 , further reducing the @entity4 's power independence the chance of blackouts , similar to those seen during the three - day week crisis of the 1970s , is currently rated as one in 3,300 by the energy regulator			1
but it could drop to as low as one in 12 over the next three years , @entity16 said			2
the @entity4 ’s spare generating capacity , currently 14 per cent , could drop to 4 per cent or even shrink to nothing at the same time , it warned			1
the ‘ alarming ’ findings have left senior figures in the energy industry desperately worried , sources say , as the vast scale of the challenges facing the @entity4 ’s energy future becomes clear			1
if the report ’s predictions come true , @entity4 could be left dependent on an unreliable undersea cable line with @entity44 for its emergency energy supply			1
@entity46 and the government could order mothballed generating plants to fire up again to plug the energy gap			2
the battle to keep the lights on could then become a stand - off between @entity4 ministers trying to keep the country running and @entity56 bureaucrats trying to enforce rulings on the @entity4			1
@entity16 said the @entity4 faced ‘ an unprecedented combination of the global financial crisis , tough environmental targets and the closure of ageing power stations that would increase the risk to consumers ’ energy supplies and could lead to higher bills ’			1
@entity67 , director of energy at @entity68 , said : ' while there is enough generation capacity to mean that widespread power - cuts are still unlikely , narrower margins mean the risks of outages are higher and scarcity of energy could also feed into possible price rises in future			1
' consumers need protection from price spikes as well as power cuts			0
‘ action is needed to guarantee the secure energy supply the @entity4 has enjoyed for decades			1
' it is right that we close our oldest and most polluting energy plants , but it is essential that new initiatives deliver investment in alternative energy generation to meet this gap			2
' at the same time however consumers can not write a blank cheque to cover the costs of new energy			0
to avoid this happening the government and regulator must ensure that the costs passed onto consumers are fully transparent and rigorously scrutinised			0
' we also need to see energy efficiency programmes being delivered as widely and effectively as possible			0
making our housing stock more energy efficient not only cuts demand and provides a greater margin with our supply – it also provides much - needed reductions in consumers ' bills			1
' the report warned that there ‘ will be a significant reduction in electricity supplies from coal and oil plants over the period , primarily driven by closures required by @entity56 environmental legislation ’			0
it added : ‘ the risk of electricity shortfalls is expected to be highest at the end of the period , in 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17			1
’ the most damaging piece of @entity3 ‘ green tape ’ , industry insiders say , is a 2001 measure designed to limit emissions for older power stations			0
the @entity130 forces all coal or oil - fired power plants built before 1987 to install expensive emissions - reducing equipment or face closure by 2015			1
it was spawned out of the @entity13 obsession with weaning all @entity56 countries off coal power			0
but because of @entity4 ’s rich mining heritage , it is a measure that hits the @entity4 harder than any other @entity3 member			1
nine of the @entity4 ’s coal and oil - fired power stations are destined to shut by 2015			1
this represents about 15 per cent of the @entity4 ’s total generating capacity			1
this would leave @entity4 dependent on imported gas – which comes with a notoriously volatile price tag			2
dark future : @entity16 warned that due to the new @entity3 rules closing power stations @entity4 may have to face 1970s blackouts by 2015 respected energy analyst @entity156 said : ‘ what ’s difficult now is that there is legislation in place that will shut down plants deliberately			1
there are very good plants that are being ordered to shut before they should			0
the rest of the coal fleet is under a sentence of death			0
’ at the moment market energy prices are about £ 50 per megawatt hour – the unit used to measure power			2
mr @entity156 said prices could ‘ easily ’ hit £ 100 per megawatt hour in 2015			2
energy secretary @entity174 said the government would respond to the report before the end of the year			0
he said : ‘ security of electricity supply is of critical importance to the health of the economy and the smooth functioning of our daily lives			0
’ consumer groups called on the government to protect homeowners from ever - rising bills			0
@entity189 , director of consumer group which ? , said : ‘ it ’s alarming to hear @entity16 predicting that we could be relying more on imported gas in a matter of years which could mean further price rises for hard - pressed consumers			0
’ ÷ @entity4 are among the world ’s biggest climate change sceptics , a poll found			2
only 63 per cent believe global warming has been scientifically proven , according to the survey of 13 countries for insurance firm @entity204			2
only @entity205 had more dissent			0
the stark warning that the lights in @entity4 could go out within three years , as a result of the country ’s mad dash towards a greener energy policy , is a terrible indictment of the prevarication and zigzags of government policy on energy			1
warnings that @entity4 ’s energy supplies were on a knife - edge were frequent during @entity221 ’s 13 years in office , but it was not until the dying months of @entity225 ’s administration that @entity226 finally committed to new nuclear			1
and while the dithering went on , the @entity3 continually tightened environmental standards , further undermining @entity4 ’s energy security			1
the coal - fired power station at @entity232 , @entity233 , will have to come off line , but plans to replace it with biomass or cleaner coal have failed to come to fruition and new nuclear is still on the drawing board			0
as for wind - power and coastal energy turbines , so favoured by the @entity242 when it came to office , the generous subsidies are being removed making it a much less attractive investment for the big six energy companies			2
meanwhile , so far the @entity242 has failed to come up with a pricing policy that makes development of a new generation of nuclear power stations sufficiently attractive to the foreign investors on whom the @entity4 is relying			2
now , energy secretary @entity174 ’s new ‘ dash for gas ’ is expected to be at the centre of the @entity253 due before the @entity254 shortly			0
but experts point out that some of the @entity4 ’s mothballed gas power stations could take years to come back on line and new capacity will take upwards of four years to build			1
most worrying of all , by placing so much emphasis on gas @entity4 exposes itself to the vicissitudes of the global energy market			1
@entity4 - owned @entity267 has taken a number of steps to secure gas supplies through the @entity273 @entity272 gas pipeline and by securing long - term liquid natural gas contracts with @entity275 – a @entity276 ally with some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world			1
but as the @entity4 has found in the past , when @entity280 closed off gas pipelines through @entity282 , power supplies are at the mercy of events beyond our control			2
unlike other trading nations , such as @entity288 , the @entity4 has failed to build sufficient storage capacity to see us through a prolonged geo - political crisis			1
the most positive thing that can be said of the warning from @entity16 is that it may finally galvanise @entity294 and a fractured government into action			0
big global power companies such as @entity298 , which owns @entity300 ’s nuclear stations , will have to be offered a firm promise of a generous base price if new nuclear is finally to go ahead			0
but it could be at least a decade before that power comes on stream			0
if the interim solution is more gas , consumers will once again find themselves at the mercy of market prices			0
in recent times wholesale gas prices have started to come down because of new @entity313 extraction techniques known as ‘ fracking ’			0
this has made the @entity313 almost self - sufficient			0
that ought to make gas supplies more plentiful			0
but relying on imported energy , at a time when the @entity276 is in flames , can hardly be regarded as looking after the nation ’s economic or national security .			0

spare energy capacity could drop to just four per cent by winter 2015
@entity4 will be reliant on other countries for supply - and prices could *skyrocket*
