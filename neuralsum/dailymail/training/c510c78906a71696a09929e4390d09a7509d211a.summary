the @entity1 - led @entity0 may have settled on a strategy to attack president @entity4 's immigration ' amnesty ' plan without shutting down the government , while giving tea party conservatives a way to vent their anger			1
it 's the ' @entity10 ' – not to be confused with the ' cronut			2
' the plan calls for a symbolic vote to de-fund @entity4 's executive actions on immigration , along with a hybrid budget plan that puts the @entity0 's immigration authorities on a short leash			1
house speaker @entity19 told lawmakers tuesday to expect a straight de-funding vote this week			0
the @entity24 , still under @entity23 control , would ignore the measure and the president would veto it in any event			0
that would tee up a budget battle that 's more about @entity1 infighting than the usual @entity1 - versus - @entity23 squabbles			1
@entity0 conservatives want to let it expire , or extend it for only a short time			0
moderates , including @entity19 and other party leaders , want an ' omnibus ' budget passed instead , funding the government through the end of next september when @entity63 's fiscal year ends			1
they fear a showdown with @entity4 would bring another partial government ' shutdown ' that the @entity0 would successfully pin on them			1
right - wingers , meanwhile , see that position as a white flag of surrender to @entity4 's immigration plan			1
so , faced with a tea party caucus large enough to block an omnibus budget , @entity19 is considering a plan that would give the party 's right wing something to crow about while keeping the @entity0 from going on the attack over a shutdown threat			1
the latest solution to @entity1 infighting is a hybrid bill that would fund most of the government through september 2015 – all except for immigration authorities , which would get a three - month ' @entity49			1
' that strategy would let @entity1 gin up another battle in early 2015 when they control both houses of @entity51			1
' the cavalry is coming , ' @entity89 @entity88 rep. @entity88 promised on tuesday during a monthly ' conversations with @entity93 ' meeting in @entity47			0
he argued that anything passed in the house should tie @entity4 's hands until january			1
' and then if @entity97 and the @entity24 do n’t pass that ... then let ’s do something very short term , ' @entity88 said			0
' let 's wait for the majority in the @entity24 to change			0
' @entity105 @entity104 rep. @entity104 told @entity106 that he believed , ' as many of the members do , ' that @entity4 's immigration plan is unconstitutional			1
' so you just want me to fund the unconstitutional act for 60 days ? ' @entity104 asked			0
' is n't that kind of like being a little bit pregnant ? no , that does n’t work for me			0
' @entity23 senate majority leader @entity97 , who will lose his leadership perch in january , signaled his support for the idea , calling it ' a big accomplishment if we could get a bill over here that would fund all the appropriations subcommittees except for one			0
' ' i think it 's kind of unfortunate that they 're talking about not doing @entity124 but that ’s the way it is , ' he told reporters on @entity43			0
the @entity0 also expressed disappointment with the option currently being considered by @entity51 on wednesday but restrained itself from issuing a veto threat			2
repeating previous assertions that the @entity0 would like @entity51 to pass a budget that funds all areas of the government through the end of the fiscal year , the president 's spokesman said today that @entity1 should refrain from adding ' unnecessary ideological riders ' to the current budget legislation			1
' there will be ample opportunity for @entity1 , next year , when they have control of both the @entity0 and the @entity24 to pursue any number of ideological ideas that they may want to codify into legislation , ' @entity0 press secretary @entity141 said			1
' there 's no reason they should attach them to a budget proposal , ' he added			0
@entity1 majority leader - elect @entity154 will meet with @entity4 at the @entity0 on wednesday to discuss the budget plan , among other issues , but the @entity0 was unwilling to provide reporters insight on that meeting during wednesday 's briefing			1
@entity160 : @entity4 is wagering that @entity1 wo n't risk losing their @entity162 luster by threatening to shut down the government in order to stop his executive ' amnesty ' order while @entity23 seemed willing to accept the current plan , @entity24 conservatives are itching for a fight			2
' the chairman of the @entity1 made a promise to @entity172 on executive amnesty : ‘ we ca n’t allow it to happen and we wo n’t let it happen … everything we can do to stop it we will , ’ @entity179 @entity178 sen. @entity178 recalled tuesday			0
' unfortunately , the plan now being circulated in the @entity0 fails to meet that test			0
' sessions objects to the ' @entity49 ' part of the ' @entity10 ' proposal , arguing that @entity185 and @entity186 should be left twisting in the wind entirely			2
' @entity51 must respond to the president ’s unlawful [ immigration ] action by funding the government but not funding illegal amnesty , ' he said			1
' this is a perfectly sound and routine application of congressional authority			0
' in the @entity0 , @entity19 faces a tough challenge : how to give outraged tea party conservatives a toothless outlet to vent over @entity4 's unilateral move to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants without permission from federal lawmakers			1
a symbolic vote to de-fund @entity207 's planned ramp - up of green cards and work permits would be one solution			2
' we 're looking at a number of options in terms of how to address this			0
this is a serious breach of our @entity217 , ' @entity19 told reporters on tuesday			0
' it 's a serious threat to our system of government , and frankly we have limited options and limited ability to deal with it directly			0
' @entity42 could find himself on a short leash for a few months if the ' @entity10 ' plan goes into effect publicly , the speaker said no decision had been made			0
but aides and lawmakers said he indicated during a closed - door meeting with the rank and file that a vote on legislation to block @entity4 was the leading option			2
it would be on a bill by @entity238 @entity1 rep. @entity1 , aimed at blocking @entity4 from unilaterally allowing categories of unlawful immigrants to live and work here			1
party leaders then hope to move on next week to voting on must - pass spending legislation to keep the government running			1
in the wake of their midterm election victories last month to win full control of @entity51 , @entity1 leaders are eager to show they can govern responsibly			1
but @entity4 's administrative moves on immigration and the resulting @entity1 fury has created complications			1
some outside conservatives were quick to register opposition , arguing that the approach would do nothing to stop @entity4 's plans stripping away the money to carry out the policy			2
' if conservative members agree to this plan , they are just as complicit in @entity4 's amnesty as everyone else			1
do n't be fooled , once this budget bill passes the amnesty will be irrevocable , ' wrote @entity265 , a columnist for the @entity266			0
meanwhile homeland security secretary @entity42 defended @entity4 's new immigration plans before a @entity0 committee where @entity1 took turns denouncing them as an unconstitutional power grab that would incite a new rush of illegal immigration at the border			1
' the president 's unilateral actions to bypass @entity51 undermine the @entity217 and threaten our democracy , ' said @entity279 @entity278 rep. @entity278 , the chairman of the @entity280			2
' we will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the president 's actions			2
' @entity42 disputed that point and others , arguing the president acted within his executive authority to temporarily defer deportations for certain immigrants who are not priorities for removal anyway			0
the actions apply mostly to people who 've been in the country five years or more and have kids who are citizens or green card holders			0
' i 'm fully comfortable that we have the legal authority to push forward these reforms , ' @entity42 said			0
' deferred action is an inherent executive branch authority that can and should be used from time to time , and we 've done so here			0
' the spending measure the @entity0 will vote on next week will top $ 1 trillion and fund the day - to - day operations of cabinet agencies through the sept. 30 end of the 2015 fiscal year			2
@entity42 spoke out strongly against putting his @entity309 on a short - term budget , saying it could prevent him from funding needed priorities including hiring protection for presidential candidates heading into the 2016 elections .			2

conservative *republicans* want to de-fund parts of the government that would implement @entity4 's orders legalizing millions of illegal immigrants
moderates including party leaders want an ' omnibus ' budget passed , fearing a showdown with @entity4 would bring another partial government ' shutdown ' that the @entity0 would successfully pin on them
the most recent ' @entity49 ' ( @entity49 ) funding the government expires on dec. 11 , just as the outgoing @entity51 packs its things
latest solution to @entity1 infighting is a hybrid ' @entity10 ' bill that would fund the government through september 2015 – except for immigration authorities , which would get a three - month ' @entity49 '
that strategy would let @entity1 gin up another battle in early 2015 when they control both houses of @entity51
