@entity0 has at last offered an insight into the rigorous beauty and health regime that helps her to maintain such a youthful appearance			2
interestingly , the 73 - year - old admitted that her seemingly ageless complexion does take a fair amount of work each and every day - starting off with a 4am wake - up call			2
' i spend anywhere from seven to 30 minutes getting my face and hair ready each morning , ' she told @entity14			0
' this does n't include the time i spend doing advance prep like my daily face mask , which i apply at 4 am , and i use hand cream with gloves			2
the tv host 's choice of pricey products caused a stir among her fans , many of whom were less than enthusiastic about the prospect of having to spend so much money on a face cream in order to replicate @entity0 's youthful appearance			1
' only $ 525 for a jar of her daily moisturizer ? i think i 'll age like a regular person , thanks , ' one reader commented , while another added : ' ladies , save your [ money ] , i 'm married to a dermatologist			0
' it 's 50 per cent genetic and 50 per cent staying out of the sun , avoiding alcohol , exercising , and eating well			0
' luckily however , not all of @entity0 's favorite beauty products come with quite the same hefty price tag			1
' i always have @entity72 's @entity71 in my medicine cabinet , ' she added			1
' at night , i wash my face really well , because i have to have my makeup done a lot			0
@entity72 's @entity71 with a warm washcloth is one great way to take it off			1
top of the range : @entity0 named this $ 525 @entity81 face cream as one of her best - loved beauty products budget - friendly : not all of @entity0 's skincare choices come with a high - end price tag			1
she insists that @entity72 's @entity71 is the best product to use when it comes to removing make - up ' i like oil because it keeps my skin very moist , and it works for me			1
i do n't get clogged pores			0
' despite being praised for her flawless complexion however , when it comes to choosing her own best physical features , @entity0 insists her hair draws in just as many compliments as her skin and credits an ever - changing roster of shampoos with helping to maintain her lustrous locks			2
@entity0 also added that following a strict workout routine , avoiding alcohol and ensuring she gets plenty of sleep have all contributed to her glowing complexion and healthy physique			1
she insists that , whenever she has a big photoshoot or event to prepare for , she spends the days leading up to it preparing , in order to make sure that she looks her very best			1
but even @entity0 admits that nobody is perfect ; she confessed that there are a number of things people would likely change about her if given the chance , but added that she does n't let any of them weigh on her mind for too long			0
' i have learned a lot over the years , but think everyone needs improvement , ' she said			0
' i could weigh 10 pounds less or comb my hair more often , for example			0

the lifestyle expert also admitted that she works out regularly , gets plenty of sleep , and avoids *drinking* alcohol before a big photoshoot or event
in *addition* to her pricey face cream , @entity0 also names @entity72 's @entity71 as one of her must - have beauty products
