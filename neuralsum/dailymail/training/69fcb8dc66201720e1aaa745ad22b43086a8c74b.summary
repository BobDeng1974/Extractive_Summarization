@entity2 's contributions to the @entity3 have topped £ 50 million a day for the first time , new figures revealed last night			1
figures released by the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) show that the @entity2 ’s contributions to @entity8 rose by 5.7 per cent last year to a record £ 18.5 billion – double the @entity9			1
at the same time , the money @entity2 received back from the @entity3 fell by almost a quarter to £ 8.1 billion , a fall of £ 2.6 billion in a year			1
rocketing bill : @entity2 contributions to @entity8 rose by 5.7 per cent last year to a record £ 18.5billion the trends meant that that the @entity2 ’s net contribution to @entity8 rocketed by 54 per cent to £ 10.3 billion			1
@entity16 , leader of the @entity2 @entity17 last night said the figures would ‘ rub salt in the wounds ’ of people pressing for a referendum on @entity2 ’s relationship with the @entity3			1
mr @entity16 said : ‘ the figures speak for themselves			0
we are paying more than ever before for our @entity3 membership and are getting less in return			2
‘ this news is a kick in the teeth for the @entity2 people who are tightening their belts in these tough times			0
’ fury : @entity16 , leader of the @entity2 @entity17 , said ' we are paying more than ever before for our @entity3 membership and are getting less in return ' the figures are likely to strengthen the hand of @entity39 who argue that @entity2 is getting a raw deal from the @entity3			1
they are also potentially embarrassing for @entity43 , who has just agreed a two per cent budget increase for the @entity45 next year , which will cost @entity2 taxpayers an extra £ 300 million			1
the prime minister has said his focus now is to prevent a major rise in the @entity3 ’ s budget for the seven - year period after 2014			2
the new figures relate to the calendar year 2010			0
@entity2 ’s gross contributions increased partly because of the decline in the value of the pound against the euro			0
the dramatic decline in receipts from the @entity3 results mainly from a controversial deal struck by @entity62 to hand back part of the annual rebate famously secured by @entity65 in 1984			0
under the terms of the 1984 deal @entity2 is repaid two thirds of the difference between what it pays out to @entity8 and what it receives back			2
last year this was worth £ 5 billion			0
but under the new arrangement struck by mr @entity62 the formula no longer apply to billions of pounds of the @entity3 budget used to fund regeneration projects in poorer member states such as @entity78 and the former communist regimes in @entity80			0
the new figures also suggest the the @entity81 is likely to have underestimated the future cost of the @entity3			0
the @entity81 ’s latest forecast is for our net contributions to the @entity3 to hit the £ 10.3 billion mark in 2014 .			2

our contribution to @entity8 rose by 5.7 *%* last year
@entity2 net contribution to @entity3 is now £ 10.3bn
