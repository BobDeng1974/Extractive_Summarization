' when i say everyone , i literally mean everyone loves this bike - from the young ones to the elderly			2
' the 52 - year - old , a tractor driver at a nearby agricultural firm , has been using his extreme wood - whittling skills to create vehicles for the last decade			1
after honing his skills with three wooden pushbikes , the craftsman tried his hand at a chopper , but the bike fell flat due to the puny 50cc engine it had installed			1
but refusing to be daunted , @entity22 went on to create a wooden motorcycle with a 200cc engine and a fully - functioning wooden car			2
the three - seater - including its wheels - is constructed entirely from pine , with handlebars made from the horns of @entity16 the motorcycle , shown here from the rear , includes a @entity64 200cc engine his latest masterpiece took six months to build , with many of @entity22 's friends donating spare parts to the cause and after clocking a beautiful custom - built three - seater at a motorcycle show last year , @entity22 resolved to make his own - except made only from wood			1

the @entity8 began working on the bike 's wooden wheels , which consist of 36 individual pieces screwed and glued together , in november 2013 and finished on may 1 this year			1

' i know that it 's not fast , but i can truly say that i have built this myself			0

@entity110 sits on his chopper bike that features a powerful engine and very fine wooden details @entity26 and his wife @entity114 are pictured with a third wooden bike in the front of their family house in @entity119 , @entity8 @entity120 rides her husband 's smaller wooden pushbike in @entity123 ' at the moment the bike always stays under the open sky as i do n't have a garage in our yard			1
' i would like to sell it or exchange it for something useful around our house , maybe for some heavy duty tools , something white machinery or anything like that			0
' or , best of all , i 'd like to sell it to someone who appreciates my skills and the hard - earned product of that			2
' the bike would probably be up for sale for around £ 3000 , but it may be more or may be less			0
it 's impossible to put a figure on it			0
