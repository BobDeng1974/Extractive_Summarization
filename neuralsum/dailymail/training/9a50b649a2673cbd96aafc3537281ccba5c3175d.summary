by @entity1 reporter published : 12:24 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 12 june 2013 mayor @entity2 has painted an unsettling picture for @entity4 , one where @entity5 was just a paltry beginning of what could be a city increasingly devastated by the effects of global warming			1
following some startling figures released by city officials — that , for instance , by the 2050s , 800,000 people could be living in a flood zone that would cover a quarter of the land , with temperatures steadily rising — @entity2 spoke tuesday on the risks to @entity4 from future storms like @entity5			1
the mayor also took such discussions a step further by meeting , head on , the problem of a rapidly changing environment in @entity4 as a whole			2
@entity29 ... even worse : @entity5 , which caused the biggest storm surge ever in @entity4 , was likely just the start of major and widespread climate change affects on @entity4 according to fresh @entity4 and @entity35 data and with projections that local waters could within decades be a foot to 2.5 feet higher than they are today , which would leave 8 percent of the city 's coastline flooding just from high tides , the mayor ’s decision to speak out on the issue comes as no surprise			1
' piece by piece , over many years and even decades , we can build a city that 's capable of preparing better , withstanding more and overcoming anything , ' he said			2
among @entity2 's suggestions were for removable flood walls to be set up for much of lower @entity53 , a 15 - to - 20 - foot levee to guard part of @entity56 , and a system of gates and levees to protect a @entity61 creek			1
' this plan is incredibly ambitious , ' @entity2 said of his proposed $ 20 billion plan			1
' this is urgent work , and it must begin now			0
' under water : @entity5 caused massive flooding in the @entity4 area			2
new studies say to expect a lot more in the coming decades			0
@entity71 has proposed a $ 20 plan to stem such disaster scary possibilities : rising sea levels could push storm surges like the unprecedented one seen by @entity5 even higher			1
a map indicates the lower lying areas into which rising tides would flow			0
@entity2 wants to build infrastructure to stop it the recommendations drew from updated predictions from the @entity83 on @entity84 , a scientists ' group convened by the city			1
updated numbers from 2009 data , which themselves looked grim , show equally shocking outcomes from climate change in @entity4 ... but the changes will come even sooner			1
by 2050 , @entity4 could expect : @entity94 water levels up to 1 to 2.5 feet higher			1
which means 8 percent of the coastline could be flooded just from high tide			1
and 800,000 people could live within a 100 - year - floodplain			0
the average day could be 4 to 7 degrees hotter			0
the temperature could be at or over 90 degrees fahrenheit for some 57 days a year			0
the average day could be 4 degrees to nearly 7 degrees @entity106 hotter by mid-century , the panel estimates in data @entity102 and @entity104 discussed monday			0
a once - in - a - century storm would likely spur a surge 5 feet or more higher than did @entity5 , which sent a record 14 - foot storm tide gushing into lower @entity53			1
@entity111 , the state government and others have released warnings over the years about climate risks			0
the city has required some new developments in flood zones to be elevated and has restored wetlands as natural barriers , among other steps			2
‘ @entity5 , obviously , increased the urgency of dealing with this and the need to plan and start to take concrete steps , ’ @entity104 said			0
the new projections echo 2009 estimates from the climate change panel , but the timeframe for some upper - end possibilities has moved up from the 2080s to mid-century			2
soaked : low - lying areas were especially hard hit by @entity5			0
city officials have now released data that such areas -- up to 8 percent of the city -- could be flooded just at high tide by 2050 preparation : ' piece by piece , over many years and even decades , we can build a city that 's capable of preparing better , withstanding more and overcoming anything , ' said mayor @entity2 june 11 ‘ the overall numbers are similar , but we have more compelling evidence now that ( a more severe scenario from 2009 ) is looking like a more realistic possibility now , ’ due to improved computer models and more evidence that some ice sheets are melting , said @entity144 , a climate scientist with @entity147 's @entity146 and a researcher with the city climate panel			1
meanwhile , the @entity35 released revisions monday to proposed new flood zone maps for the city			2
about 218,000 people and 35,000 buildings are in the current once - in - 100 - year flood zone , drawn in the 1980s			0
sooner than later : @entity71 tours storm - ravaged @entity162			0
the administration is now addressing fears of future vulnerabilities from storms and other weather due to newer , scarier climate change data the new maps roughly double those numbers , though the revision shifts about 5,800 structures from a subset called the v zone - the area expected to suffer the worst damage - to a less stringent zone			1
a roughly two - year review is expected before new maps become official			0
scientists have reached a consensus on global warming but still debate how severe the effects will be .			0

waters could be 1 to 2.5 feet higher in @entity4 by 2050 , according to updated data from city researchers
8 percent of the city 's coastline could flood -- and that 's just at high tide
the mayor drew upon the new data as part of a tuesday speech that proposed a $ 20 billion plan for new flood walls , levees , and other infrastructure to stem future climate - related damage
