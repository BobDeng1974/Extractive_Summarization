@entity2 should have no fear of quitting the @entity4 , which could ‘ open up opportunities ’ for the country , a senior @entity1 minister says today			1
culture secretary @entity7 , increasingly tipped as a future party leader , said he was not concerned about @entity2 ’s prospects outside the @entity4 if people voted to leave in a referendum			1
‘ i think it would open up opportunities			2
i am not afraid of that at all , ’ he told the @entity12 in a wide - ranging interview			0
culture secretary @entity7 , increasingly tipped as a future party leader , said he was not concerned about @entity2 ’s prospects outside the @entity4 if people voted to leave in a referendum			1
he said it could ' open opportunities ' the @entity21 ’ pledge to give people their first say on @entity2 ’s place in @entity24 for nearly 40 years – and a commitment to stop @entity24 human rights judges interfering in @entity2 law – will be centrepieces of the party ’s pitch at next year ’s general election			1
the prime minister will unveil plans to curtail the role of the controversial @entity35 in the @entity2 at the final @entity1 conference before the election , which starts this weekend in @entity38			2
he is expected to pledge to scrap @entity40 ’s @entity39 and replace it with a @entity2 @entity41			2
mr @entity42 will promise a mechanism which will establish pre-eminence for @entity2 ’s @entity46 and @entity45 , allowing them to over-ride @entity49 rulings , according to sources			1
mr @entity7 backed the prime minister ’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with @entity54 before holding a referendum by the end of 2017			1
‘ we have reason to be confident , ’ he said			0
‘ look at what we have already achieved – getting us out of the @entity4 bailout fund , reducing the budget of the @entity4 , vetoing a treaty			2
’ but the @entity7 went further than mr @entity42 on the possibility of an exit , insisting @entity2 could prosper outside the @entity4			1
‘ if you said to me : “ are you worried or frightened or concerned that the @entity2 people might vote to leave ? ” , that does n’t frighten me , ’ mr @entity7 said			1
the @entity7 backed prime minister @entity42 ’s plan to renegotiate looser ties with @entity54 before holding a referendum by 2017 ‘ we should have a referendum on in / out , and if the @entity2 people decide @entity2 is better off outside , i would respect that decision			1
i think it would open up opportunities			0
i am not afraid of that at all			0
’ the @entity77 , which is enshrined in @entity2 law by the @entity39 , has become increasingly unpopular with most conservatives			0
critics say the @entity49 court has roamed way beyond its remit and created new rights never intended by the founders of the convention – such as its recent attempt to insist @entity2 must overturn a blanket ban on prisoners voting in elections			0
the @entity35 has also been cited by dozens of people fighting deportation , who have argued its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights to be considered , including the right to a family life			0
mr @entity42 is understood to be convinced that much @entity100 sentiment is due to @entity49 rulings preventing the removal of foreign - born criminals and terror suspects , though the convention and the court in fact have nothing to do with @entity54			2
two of the government ’s biggest defenders of the court – former attorney general @entity108 and veteran cabinet minister @entity111 – were sacked in the prime minister ’s cabinet reshuffle this summer			0
‘ this issue is now going to be dealt with , ’ said one government source			0
@entity1 strategists also hope a harder line on human rights laws will help win over disaffected voters considering backing @entity120 .			0
