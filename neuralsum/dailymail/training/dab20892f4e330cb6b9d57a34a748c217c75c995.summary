by @entity0 the @entity3 newspaper sent top - secret files containing classified information to the @entity6 by household courier @entity7 , it was revealed last night			1
the security risk is the latest to engulf the newspaper after the head of @entity11 warned last week that publication of confidential data leaked by @entity6 fugitive @entity14 had caused huge ‘ harm ’ to the capability of @entity18 ’s intelligence services			1
last night , senior security figures lambasted the newspaper for using @entity7 to carry the encrypted files			1
' huge damage ' : the leaks from former intelligence worker @entity14 , pictured here received an award while in exile in @entity25 , have been condemned by intelligence experts former anti-terror law watchdog @entity27 said the decision may have put the lives of @entity18 spies in danger			1
‘ i think it is astonishing that top - secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system , ’ he said			2
security chiefs are also understood to be ‘ very concerned ’ at the use of a courier company			2
one source said : ‘ any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements			0
’ the data – from @entity46 , the government ’s secret communications headquarters – was copied from the original @entity49 on to a usb memory stick and sent by @entity7 to a ‘ disguised ’ @entity6 intermediary in june this year			1
measures were taken to ensure its safe passage			0
he was told that if @entity3 was ‘ muzzled ’ he was to make sure the material was published on @entity57 , a not - for - profit @entity59 website which publishes investigative journalism			1
weeks later , @entity46 officials visited the newspaper ’s @entity64 offices to destroy computers and hard drives in the belief they had closed the security breach			1
' @entity70 ' : @entity3 , edited by @entity71 , pictured , has been accused of endangering @entity11 and @entity73 agents the decision to send the files by courier is believed to have been taken within days of @entity3 editor @entity71 returning from @entity6 , where he had been working with the @entity3 ’s @entity59 office on how to handle the fall - out from the @entity14 leaks			1
mr @entity71 has since admitted he was worried the government would seek an injunction to seize the material , preventing any further publication of the @entity14 files			1
according to a report last week in @entity86 , mr @entity71 sent a ‘ @entity7 package containing a thumbnail drive of selected @entity14 documents to an intermediary in the @entity6 ’			1
the magazine told @entity92 that it stood by its story , which had been ‘ multiple sourced ’			0
the government only became aware that material may have been sent out of the country when @entity71 met cabinet secretary sir @entity97 and the prime minister ’s head of communications , @entity98 , at @entity3 ’s offices on june 21			1
according to @entity86 , @entity71 hinted that the government might be too late to prevent publication of further material			0
on july 20 , @entity3 gave permission for officers from @entity46 to destroy hard drives holding the secret files at its @entity110 offices			1
vulnerable : the @entity3 reportedly uploaded a cache of intelligence files into a usb memory stick to send them to the @entity6 two days later , @entity3 admitted to the government that ‘ secret material ’ had been given to @entity57			1
it is not clear whether @entity3 told the intelligence services that the material had been sent by @entity7 , when it was sent or where from			1
last night , @entity121 , editor - in - chief of @entity57 , confirmed he had received the files			2
he said : ‘ the material is in our possession			0
it ’s in a safe place			0
at one point we were told the @entity129 was going to ask for it back but they never did			0
’ he confirmed the memory stick ‘ was sent ’ but when asked how or from where , he said : ‘ i ’m not going to go into that ... it came through			2
' i do n’t know how it got to me			0
it found its way through			0
we were prepared had they been injuncted to do what needed to be done ’			0
last night , the revelations about the sending of secrets was branded ‘ astonishing ’ by @entity143 , who called on the attorney general to consider legal action against the newspaper			2
@entity143 accused @entity3 of playing ‘ a parlour game ’ with national security			1
his comments are at odds with other leading @entity151 , including business secretary @entity152 , who have supported @entity3			1
special delivery : the @entity3 used the @entity7 parcel service to deliver the files he said : ‘ i am very surprised @entity3 has not paid enough attention to comments by @entity159 [ @entity11 director general ] and others about the damage these disclosures have done or can still do to national security			1
' there are individuals whose safety might be affected by these disclosures			0
we are talking about @entity11 , @entity73 and the national security agents of other countries			1
' i think it is astonishing that a large amount of top - secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system			2
' i think it is quite wrong that it should have been sent outside the country to avoid the jurisdiction of the @entity18 courts			0
' i hope the attorney general will examine what @entity3 has done to determine whether there is any action to be taken			1
national security is not a parlour game			1
’ attorney general @entity187 could seek an injunction against @entity3 to deliver up the material			1
' if refused , the editor would be in contempt of court and could be imprisoned for up to two years			0
last night , @entity3 refused to say how the material was sent			1
a spokesman said : ‘ an encrypted form of a limited number of documents was safely sent to @entity57			0
we ’re not going to talk about what those documents were			0
’ in 2010 , @entity7 was at the centre of the printer bomb alert when an @entity202 bomb was found at its depot in @entity204			2
and in 2006 , a former employee admitted selling confidential account numbers of clients using @entity7 ’s @entity64 depot			2
an earlier version of this article indicated that the number of files the @entity3 fedexed to @entity6 was tens of thousands ; the @entity3 has since indicated that it numbered less than 100			1
the newspaper also said that the files it fedexed to @entity6 did not contain any names of @entity18 spies			1
@entity14 's treachery has put the lives of our spies at risk : comment by @entity224 , ex-chairman of @entity226 intelligence committee @entity224 , pictured , argues that @entity14 's leaks have jeopardised national security despite the self - righteous pomposity of @entity14 , who claims from his @entity231 - protected @entity25 hideout that he does n’t want to live in a society that places its citizens under surveillance , his revelations about the secret state have told us little			1
@entity46 exists precisely to do what @entity14 has ‘ uncovered ’			2
who is genuinely surprised that , in its efforts to protect this country , @entity46 is monitoring all possible terrorist means of communication ? who would n’t be outraged if it were it not ? what @entity14 has done by revealing the detail of collection techniques as well as vast quantities of highly sensitive intelligence material , is jeopardise our national security and the lives of those who take great risks to protect us			1
to expose at the very least 58,000 secret and top secret @entity18 intelligence documents to the gaze of @entity259 and @entity260 authorities and to publicise the details of intelligence collection capability is the most damaging act of betrayal in the history of intelligence treachery			2
there is no question the @entity259 and the @entity260 will be pulling out the stops to exploit this windfall			0
the same applies to our tech - savvy jihadist enemies , who are more than capable of rapidly learning the lessons @entity14 has taught them			2
i am no less troubled than anyone else about the extent to which private citizens are spied on			0
in my opinion only one thing can justify the range and scale of activity that @entity11 , @entity46 and the @entity283 are engaged in			0
that is a serious and lethal threat to the people of this country			0
today that threat comes from terrorism			0
as a soldier i have fought terrorism and been attacked by terrorists			0
involved in intelligence work in @entity64 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 , i have read and analysed thousand upon thousand of secret intelligence reports including phone and email intercepts			2
i know first - hand the danger that we face from terrorism and the vital role intelligence plays in protecting us from it			2
some 100 years ago @entity18 ’s @entity304 intercepted every message sent on transatlantic cables between @entity307 and the @entity6			2
this was extremely risky as it involved intercepting communications between neutral powers , but nobody today would question its ultimate legitimacy or its value in defeating the @entity315			0
compared with an all - out struggle for national survival , use of such measures in the shadowy fight against terrorism might seem harder to reconcile			0
but it is just as important nontheless			0
few would argue with targeted surveillance against known suspects			0
but we can not then ignore the unknown terrorists			0
and in collecting information , the intelligence services have no choice but to collect material that has nothing to do with terrorism			0
while working for the @entity334 and @entity226 , i was involved with many cases where @entity46 and @entity283 communications intelligence led directly to the disruption of terrorist activity both here in the @entity18 and against @entity18 soldiers and civilians abroad			0
communications intercept has played a significant role in every important @entity11 terrorist investigation since 9/11 , with more than 330 suspects convicted of terrorism offences			0
@entity14 is only partially responsible for the harm that he has done			2
far greater culpability lies with the @entity6 intelligence apparatus for permitting such damaging theft of their secret intelligence , especially in the wake of the @entity355 fiasco			1
by bringing their clearly inadequate internal security measures up to date , the @entity283 can and must prevent recurrence of @entity14 ’s betrayal .			1

the newspaper saved files from leaker @entity14 to a usb stick
it then sent the files to the @entity6 via the @entity7 delivery service
the move has been described as creating a security risk
intelligence experts have accused @entity3 of ' playing parlour games ' with national security
