by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:08 pm on 17th july 2011 as the debt ceiling deadline draws dangerously close , @entity2 was spotted heading to church with his family in @entity6 this morning			1
perhaps he was praying for a solution - or better a resolution - to the small task of securing a multi-trillion - dollar deal that @entity12 @entity11 and @entity13 can agree on before the @entity15 defaults on august 2			1
if the president was feeling the strain of last week 's gruelling debt meetings , he did n't show it			2
looking resplendent in their @entity19 the @entity21 laughed and joked with each other as they made their way back to the @entity12 after the service at @entity25			2
mr @entity2 also told reporters he would ' absolutely ' be watching the women 's soccer world cup final between @entity28 and @entity29 today			2
while the @entity31 gathered around the television @entity12 and congressional aides were continuing discussions to find a solution for increasing the nation 's borrowing authority while reducing long - term deficits , behind the scenes			1
this comes after the failure to get a deal after five straight days of meetings last week between mr @entity2 and congressional leaders at the @entity12			1
but there was hope today that congressional leaders still had time ' to get something big done ' with mr @entity2			1
' i think that what is encouraging is that the leaders in @entity51 seem to have all agreed that we ca n't push to a default , ' @entity12 budget director @entity47 said			1
sunday best : the @entity21 head home after attending a service at @entity25 in @entity6 , while @entity51 leaders worked behind the scenes to try and seal a debt deal ' so i think that there are many conversations going on in order to make sure that does n't happen			1
' the government will exceed the current $ 14.3trillion debt ceiling in 16 days , after which it will be in default of its obligations			1
the consequences could be far - reaching , with potentially higher interest rates on mortgages and car loans , a halt in @entity73 checks and unsettled world financial markets			0
talks have continued over the weekend and @entity12 spokesman @entity76 said on @entity77 that mr @entity2 , vice president @entity78 and other @entity12 officials were discussing ' various options ' with lawmakers throughout the day yesterday			1
meanwhile @entity83 house speaker @entity83 is ' keeping the lines of communication open , ' his spokesman , @entity82 told @entity86			0
' meetings have been occurring			0
' @entity13 have rejected any plan that contains tax increases			2
@entity47 said on @entity91 's @entity90 that the president ' made clear he wants the largest deal possible			2
' back to the @entity12 : the president shakes hands with reverend @entity96 before he , first lady @entity97 and daughters @entity21 and @entity99 home not much to smile about : mr @entity2 shares a joke with his wife who looks less than impressed , as the family walk out of the church gates stroll : mrs @entity107 is seen with daughter @entity21 , left , while the president walks with the couple 's other daughter @entity109 after the service ' he wants to do the most we can to reduce the deficit , ' @entity47 said			1
' but he also said that if we ca n't get the most done , then in addition to extending the debt we should do as much as we can			2
' @entity12 @entity13 are preparing to vote this week on allowing an increase in the government 's borrowing limit through 2012 as long as @entity51 approves a balanced - budget constitutional amendment			1
sen. @entity120 , @entity121 , called that proof @entity13 are willing to compromise and ' hardly a radical idea ' but the @entity125 's @entity124 , @entity126 of @entity127 , said that bill does n't have the needed support in the @entity125			1
' this notion that we have to change the @entity132 to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong , ' @entity126 said			0
@entity47 also did not like the idea			0
in the background : the @entity21 head back to the @entity12 where talks between congressional leaders were thought to be ongoing throughout the weekend ' what these ideas do is say let 's kick the can down the road so that others will deal with it , ' he said			1
' the challenge is for @entity6 now to do the job the @entity28 people sent us here to do			0
' @entity120 said the @entity28 is on course for a financial disaster and that lawmakers have ' to draw a line in the sand now because a day of reckoning is going to come			0
' ' and the longer we put it off the bigger the problems are going to be for our country , ' @entity120 said			0
holding the fort : meanwhile @entity12 budget director @entity47 revealed there were ' many conversations ' going on as the battle to secure a deal before august 2 carried on however , if it comes down to it , @entity12 officials who say @entity51 wo n't let the @entity28 default are ' probably right on that , ' @entity120 said			1
senators are working on a bipartisan plan that would allow mr @entity2 to raise the debt limit without a prior vote by lawmakers			2
the talks focused on how to address long - term deficit reduction in the proposal in hopes of satisfying @entity177			1
' lines of communication remain open with all parties , ' said @entity181 , a spokesman for @entity12 speaker @entity83			2
mr @entity2 admitted that compromise was needed in talks with @entity13 to solve the crisis , during his weekly radio and internet address yesterday			1
he said it would take ' shared sacrifice ' for @entity11 and @entity13 to come to an agreement			1
' let 's be honest			0
neither party in this town is blameless , ' he said in his broadcast to the nation			0
' both have talked this problem to death without doing enough about it			0
that 's what drives people nuts about @entity6			0
' he attempted to reach out to the middle class in the address , repeating his call for higher taxes on the wealthy and reforms to politically popular entitlement programs such as @entity73 and @entity209			0
' we are all part of the same country			0
we are all in this together , ' he said			0
but @entity13 renewed their call for an amendment to require a balanced budget			1
' the only reason this administration does n't want a constitutional amendment is because they want to keep spending the @entity28 people 's money , ' senator @entity217 said in the @entity13 response			1
' and the only reason congressional @entity11 would refuse to pass it , is because they know the people of this country would rise up and quickly ratify it			0
' in his weekly broadcast mr @entity2 continued to insist that it was necessary to remove some tax breaks			2
' simply put , it will take a balanced approach , shared sacrifice , and a willingness to make unpopular choices on all our parts , ' he said			1
' that means spending less on domestic programmes , ' the president said			0
' it means spending less on defence programmes			0
... and it means taking on the tax code , and cutting out certain tax breaks and deductions for the wealthiest @entity28			0
' ' the truth is , you ca n't solve our deficit without cutting spending , ' mr @entity2 said			2
' but you also ca n't solve it without asking the wealthiest @entity28 to pay their fair share - or without taking on loopholes that give special interests and big corporations tax breaks that middle - class @entity28 do n't get			0
