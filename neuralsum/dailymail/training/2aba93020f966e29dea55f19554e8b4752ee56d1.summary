by @entity0 an @entity2 company has created a protective blanket that developers say could give children a better chance of surviving debris from a tornado â€” or bullets from a 9 mm handgun			1
the @entity11 , made by @entity12 , is a bulletproof pad designed to protect students during disasters at school			0
the 5/16 - inch thick rectangle features backpack - like straps that allow users to put it on , and then duck and cover			1
@entity24 developed the pad , @entity23 reported			1
@entity24 started on the idea after a massive tornado struck last year in @entity27 , killing 24 people including seven children inside an elementary school that did n't have a tornado shelter			1
he gave a sketch of the protective blanket to @entity51 , an inventor and one of his patients , during an appointment			2
the two form half of the executive team at @entity12			0
the others are @entity58 and @entity59			0
@entity60 is an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at @entity62			0
he introduced the team to @entity65 , a high - density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than @entity68			2
the new material also protects against nails , shards of metal and other sharp objects			0
' instead of bending over and hoping for the best , they 're afforded an extra layer of protection , ' @entity51 said			2
at $ 1,000 per blanket , he and others with the company say buying one per student would be less expensive than building tornado shelters			1
' by no means would we ever say that this is more protective , ' @entity24 said			1
' but when you have budget constraints , this might be a viable alternative			0
' @entity12 took a finished blanket to a shooting range and had it subjected to a @entity92 test , which is used to test body armor for police units			2
the classification implies protection against various projectiles , including 9 mm and .22 - caliber bullets			1
it passed , @entity51 said			0
the blanket has been in production for about 10 months , and the team started marketing it about a week ago , he said			0
