the words ' halfbreed ' and ' breed ' are offensive and should be removed from the names of creeks and other places in @entity7 , a state lawmaker said			1
@entity9 rep @entity8 introduced a bill yesterday that would require state and other agencies to strip the terms from maps , signs and markers when ' wear or vandalism ' make a replacement necessary			2
the idea for the latest measure came out of work with members of the @entity23			0
offensive : a @entity7 lawmaker has introduced a bill to remove ' half - breed ' and ' breed ' from place names in the state			1
more than 757 places in the @entity32 used the term ' @entity34 ' in their names in 2012 ( file photo ) the @entity7 bill would also create a volunteer advisory group to determine replacement names			1
@entity40 is the most prominent of 17 places throughout @entity7 with the word ' half - breed ' or ' breed ' in the name , according to @entity45 , a historian who works with the @entity23			1
similar measures have passed elsewhere across the @entity32 , though the federal government outlaws only two types of place names			2
the @entity50 is the government body that approves all names on maps put out by federal agencies , including the @entity55 and the @entity56			2
they include : in 1963 , it changed geographic names containing a derogatory term for black people ( the n - word ) , and in 1974 it changed all names containing a disparaging word for @entity65 ( ' @entity66 ' )			1
the board has strict rules about changing names , and says it discourages name changes unless necessary			2
it ' prefers to interfere as little as possible within the use of names in everyday language because attitudes and perceptions of words considered to be pejorative vary between individuals and can change connotation from one generation to another '			0
however there have been local pushes to eliminate offensive names found on geographic features throughout the country			0
the new @entity7 bill expands on one that passed through the state legislature in 1999 to remove ' squaw ' from place names in the state			1
all 76 places in @entity7 with that word since have been changed , or a change is pending			1
at least nine other states — @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 — also have removed the offensive word from place names or have passed legislation encouraging it			2
@entity108 , director of the @entity23 's native languages program , testified that as someone with a heritage that includes @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , he has been referred to as a ' dirty half - breed ' throughout his life			1
@entity40 is the most prominent of 17 places throughout @entity7 with the word ' half - breed ' or ' breed ' in the name ' i never told any non-indians that i was an @entity127 or that i was ' breed , ' as i knew i would be subjected to some snide or racist remarks , ostracized or made to feel i was out of place , ' mr @entity124 said			1
a @entity9 member of the @entity131 , @entity132 , recently used the term ' half - breed ' to refer to president @entity135 on his blog			1
the education board , @entity138 governor @entity137 and the state 's two @entity32 senators have all called for his resignation , which mr @entity132 has refused			0
he has since taken down his ' @entity144 ' blog and said he is not a racist			0
' @entity146 on @entity147 ' and other offensive places the @entity149 lists places with the terms ' half - breed ' or ' breed ' in @entity138 , @entity154 and @entity155			1
there have also been pushes to eliminate other offensive names found on geographic features throughout the country			0
there are 757 places with ' @entity34 ' in the name , according to an analysis of government records in 2012 , though many of those place names were not spelled that way originally			2
the @entity149 lists nine places with the word ' @entity34 ' in @entity7 , along with seven places using the offensive term ' chinaman '			1
@entity7 also has a stream called ' @entity146 ' located on ' @entity147 ' and a dam called ' @entity173 '			0
a draft of @entity176 's bill available on the state legislature 's website makes no mention of other offensive terms			0
@entity181 has reached out to the representative for comment			0
twenty places throughout the @entity32 used ' @entity185 ' ( and many more that have been changed to ' @entity187 ' ) , and there were 1,100 @entity189 , six ' @entity190 , ' 10 cripples , 58 places named @entity193 , and 30 ' @entity194 '			0
there were eight ' @entity197 , ' 35 ' spooks , ' 14 ' @entity199 , ' 30 ' spades , ' and too many ' @entity201 ' to count			0
there are also at least seven ' @entity203 ' .			0

@entity7 rep. @entity8 wants ' half - breed ' and ' breed ' removed
@entity209 *supports* changing 17 names in state
federal board *previously* removed n - word and @entity65 slurs
@entity7 has nine places with ' @entity34 ' names and seven with ' @entity219 '
