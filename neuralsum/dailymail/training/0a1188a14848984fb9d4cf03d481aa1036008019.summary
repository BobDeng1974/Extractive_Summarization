‘ patients and the public should be confident they can trust information about how hospitals are performing and a culture of honesty and accuracy will help those organisations drive up standard of care			0
‘ if @entity13 trusts are caught deliberately manipulating that information , whether waiting times or death rates , they need to be held to account			1
’ if approved , the move will mean trusts could be fined millions and managers jailed if they are found to have falsified data on waiting times or death rates			1
several hospitals have been accused of fixing high mortality rates by ‘ misrecording ’ causes of death			2
this makes it almost impossible for regulators to check up on hospitals with poor standards of treatment and for patients to make decisions on where they want to be treated			0

up to 1,200 patients died as a result of poor care at hospitals in the @entity16 trust hospitals and ministers are expected to announce their measures to avoid a repeat of the scandal in ten days ’ time			0

the criminal sanctions will be put in place to ensure that hospitals publish reliable data without manipulating figures to hit targets			0
board members of @entity13 trusts and individual senior managers responsible for the data would be held criminally liable for seeking to manipulate information			1
the @entity98 , health regulators or members of the public would be able to report managers and hospitals directly to the police if they had concerns about any statistics			2
a source close to mr @entity1 said : ‘ the manipulation of data has been happening , rarely , but consistently for many years			0
we feel strongly that if @entity13 trusts are caught acting fraudulently about their performance on areas such as death rates or waiting times , they should be criminally liable			1
’ more than a dozen hospitals are now being investigated over higher than expected death rates			1
the health secretary said for the first time this week that sir @entity72 , who has been described as the @entity118 , ' bears some responsibility ' as the manager of the @entity16 health authority during the scandal .			2
