by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 09:17 est , 17 october 2013 the mysterious six - sided storm on @entity3 ’s @entity2 has long captivated astronomers			2
but up until now , images taken of it have been in infrared wavelengths , showing false - colour shades of red , orange and green			1
now @entity13 ’s @entity12 spacecraft , which has been orbiting the planet for over nine years , has captured the northern hexagon in its true , incredible colours			1
the colour composite below has been created from raw images taken by @entity12 from a distance of 379,268 miles away			1
it shows the strange geometric structure of the hexagon alongside the impressive variation in shades around @entity3 ’s northern hemisphere			0
this older , colour composite image - showing false shades - has been created from raw images taken by @entity12 from a distance of 379,268 miles away the mysterious six - sided hexagon on @entity3 ’s @entity2 has long captivated astronomers is thought to be is nearly 15,000 miles ( 25,000 kilometers ) across			1
the hexagon is made of a band of upper - atmospheric winds which creates its six - sided shape			1
a polar cyclone can be seen at its centre			0
first seen by @entity43 1 and 2 over 30 years ago the hexagon it thought to be fixed with @entity3 ’s rotation			0
in april , the @entity12 spacecraft provided scientists with the first close - up , visible - light views of a behemoth hurricane swirling within the hexagon			1
thin , bright clouds at the outer edge of the hurricane were estimated to be travelling at around 330 mph ( 150 meters per second )			0

' we did a double take when we saw this vortex because it looks so much like a hurricane on @entity68 , ' said @entity69 , a @entity12 imaging team member at the @entity71 in @entity72			2
' but there it is at @entity3 , on a much larger scale , and it is somehow getting by on the small amounts of water vapor in @entity3 's hydrogen atmosphere			0
' this spectacular , vertigo inducing , false - color image from @entity13 's @entity12 mission highlights the storms at @entity3 's north pole scientists are now studying the hurricane to gain insight into hurricanes on @entity68 , which feed off warm ocean water			1
although there is no body of water close to these clouds high in @entity3 's atmosphere , learning how these @entity3 storms use water vapor could tell scientists more about how terrestrial hurricanes are generated and sustained			2
both a terrestrial hurricane and @entity3 's north polar vortex have a central eye with no clouds or very low clouds			2
other similar features include high clouds forming an eye wall , other high clouds spiraling around the eye , and a counter-clockwise spin in the northern hemisphere			0
a major difference between the hurricanes is that the one on @entity3 is much bigger than its counterparts on @entity68 and spins surprisingly fast			0
at @entity3 , the wind in the eye wall blows more than four times faster than hurricane - force winds on @entity68 .			2
