by @entity0 last updated at 11:17 am on 30th june 2011 maths teaching in schools should be overhauled , with the introduction of @entity6 - style daily teaching and a focus on fundamentals , the @entity1 has suggested			1
@entity9 has signalled a return to academic rigour in the maths curriculum amid concerns that the @entity14 is lagging behind other countries			1
he suggested daily maths lessons and regular tests are to be adopted , inspired by the system in @entity19 , with the possible return of ‘ numeracy hour ’ – a @entity23 initiative scrapped two years ago			2
summing it up : @entity9 ( left ) wants a return to academic rigour in the maths curriculum , with fractions and algebra teaching given a boost under his proposals , lessons for primary school children are to focus on fractions and the building blocks of algebra			1
and those in secondary school will study advanced calculus and statistics – currently the preserve of a-level students			1
mr @entity9 also suggested that within a decade all children should study maths in some form up to the age of 18 – which will be the school leaving age from 2015			1
the proposals come amid concerns that half the adult population lacks ‘ basic maths skills ’			2
@entity52 schools are slipping down international league tables in the subject while countries such as @entity19 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 steam ahead			2
at the age of 15 , pupils in @entity57 are around two academic years ahead of @entity14 counterparts in the subject			0
primary pupils need to be taught maths every day to prepare them for secondary school , mr @entity9 says in a speech to the @entity68 yesterday , mr @entity9 said : ‘ if we are to keep pace with our competitors , we need fundamental , radical reform in the curriculum , in teaching , and in the way we use technology in the classroom			1
‘ unless we dramatically improve our performance , the grim arithmetic of globalisation will leave us all poorer			0
’ mr @entity9 will publish details of reforms following the national curriculum review			1
dame @entity84 , chairman of the @entity85 , welcomed his proposals			0
she said : ‘ the @entity14 has a proud track record of achievement in science and engineering , with the most productive research base among leading economies			0
‘ however , we need to place science and innovation at the heart of the @entity14 ’s long - term strategy for economic growth if we are to remain competitive , and at the apex of this must be inspiring the next generation of scientists , mathematicians and engineers			0
‘ the education secretary ’s recognition that more students should be studying maths and for longer is particularly welcome			0
’ currently , maths is compulsory up to the age of 16			0
only around 13 per cent of pupils , some 85,000 , take it at a or as - level each year .			0
