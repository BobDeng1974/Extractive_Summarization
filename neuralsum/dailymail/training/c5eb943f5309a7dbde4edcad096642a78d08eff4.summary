' numbers are all over place and it is normal there are outstanding amounts of money			2
it is not a revelation			2
' after the claimant went to @entity4 it was like she had set false alarm bells ringing			1
' it 's like running to a school teacher claiming something that is n't true			2
' previously she said when she emailed the @entity62 asking if she could discuss these matters with him , he sent her a scathing reply , copying in everyone else in the office			2
straight talk : miss @entity2 told the tribunal that @entity4 dismissed her as a : ' nice girl , do n't do a lot ' @entity2 wept earlier in the week as she said he wrote to her : " i do n't know what you 're doing but this ai n't how things work around here			1
' the senior executive also denied telling former ms @entity2 that there was no job for her			0
