whiskey element claims to make cheap alcohol taste like expensive whiskey by infusing it with a woody flavour when placed in a decanter and can be aged in oak barrels stored in cellars for years			1
now , there ’s a wooden tool that saves time and money called ‘ @entity0 , ’ which claims to be able to make cheap liquor taste expensive in just 24 hours			1
the oak sticks are specially designed to ‘ age ’ the drink by filtering out impurities and infusing the whiskey with a more woody flavour similar to pricier tipples			1
the sticks have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall - surface area touching the liquid			0
they are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive tipple			1
they do this via ‘ accelerated transpiration through capillary action , ’ according to the @entity40 , @entity41 - based company ’s @entity38 page , which means the liquid travels through tiny tubes in the wood			1
@entity45 is raising money to the whiskey elements into production			0
the inventors say they got their idea while working in a liquor store when they asked themselves : ‘ what ’s the difference between top shelf and well , whiskey ? ’ ‘ and then it hit us			0
if the goal is for the whiskey to filter in and out of the wood to remove toxins , get infused with flavour , and pull out those rich colours , what if the barrel is n’t the best design to achieve this process ? , ’ they wrote			0
@entity68 explained that wood barrels are used for containing whiskey because the wood is cut vertically so that capillaries are not exposed to the liquid , meaning that it does n't slowly seep out of the sides of the wood			0
the sticks ( pictured ) have lots of grooves cut in them to increase the overall - surface area touching the @entity80 are intended to be placed in a bottle or decanter of cheap whiskey to replicate the taste of a more expensive bottle			1
the oak is cut horizontally to allow ‘ accelerated transpiration through capillary action ' the elements are made from oak - like the barrels used for ageing expensive whiskey			1
the idea is that they mimic the ageing process to re-create the taste of pricey liquor after being placed in a bottle of cheap whisky for just 24 hours			1
they do this via transpiration through capillary action			2
the sticks are cut horizontally from a large piece of wood , so the grain runs down their length			0
this so there is a shorter distance for whiskey to travel through its capilaries , and ' age ' the alcohol			0
it also has grooves to increase the surface area of wood touching liquid			0
the whiskey elements remove chemical compounds @entity120 and @entity122 from cheap whiskey			2
the impurity found in pig faeces and chemical blamed for hangovers are not found in high - end whiskey			2
so once the sticks have been used , the expensive and cheap whiskey are more chemically similar and have a similar taste			1
the sticks are made by cutting the wood horizontally to provide a ‘ shorter distance for whiskey to travel through its repetitive exposure to the capillaries , so it matures much faster and becomes of a much higher quality			0
’ to test the product , the inventors put their sticks through their paces in the lab , where they compared top shelf whiskey costing over $ 100 a bottle that had been aged for over 10 years , with cheaper versions treated with a whiskey element			2
they analysed the chemicals found in expensive and cheap whiskey			2
researchers found that the cheap bottles contained high levels of @entity153 – found in pig and mouse faeces – and @entity122 , a compound blamed for hangovers			2
in comparison , the expensive aged bottles contained almost none of either			0
the researchers then added the oak sticks to the cheap liquor and waited 24 hours before testing them again			1
mr @entity68 said : ‘ the results were amazing			0
they showed characteristics found in top - shelf aged whiskeys with notably higher levels of the chemicals responsible for good flavours and smells , as well as a significant reduction in @entity120 and @entity122			0
’ each stick can only be used once for maximum effectiveness and a two - pack is available to pre-order for $ 12 ( £ 7.50 ) plus shipping			1
the company has also come up with natural flavoured sticks so that flavours including vanilla , cherry , maple , smokey and peaty can be infused into spirits			0

@entity195 tool , @entity0 , was invented by a company in @entity41
it claims to make cheap whiskey taste expensive in just 24 hours
grooved oak stick is left is placed in a bottle of cheap whiskey and filters out impurities while infusing it with an *luxurious* - tasting woody flavour to ' age ' it
@entity195 is cut to allow ' accelerated transpiration through capillary action '
use of the tool makes cheap whiskey more chemically similar to aged liquor
chemical compound blamed for hangovers is removed as well as impurities
oak sticks are available to pre-order on @entity38 from $ 12 ( £ 7.50 ) for two
