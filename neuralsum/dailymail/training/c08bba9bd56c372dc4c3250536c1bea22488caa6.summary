' he claimed at @entity98 police station that someone else had started the fight , telling officers : ' i think he was a silly fat @entity12 mp			1
' he was pushing like a girl and giving me a bear - hug			1
it was a wee scuffly thing … if people said i was hammered , that was probably true			0
' @entity111 , defending , said his client had little recollection of the events as he had not eaten all day and had been ' working intently ' since 8.30am			0
