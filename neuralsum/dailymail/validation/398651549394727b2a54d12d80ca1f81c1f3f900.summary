motorsport fans watched in horror on saturday as two classic racing cars which have been lovingly maintained for decades crashed into each other while driving around @entity5			2
the unique @entity7 ' , worth an estimated £ 4million , which was being driven by @entity8 and @entity9 legend @entity6 crashed into the back of a @entity12 - @entity11 - thought to be worth around £ 1million			1
the one - of - a - kind 1955 @entity7 - originally made out of aluminium - had been transported to the @entity15 racetrack from @entity17 collector dr @entity16 especially for the @entity19 race			1
the @entity12 , owned by @entity40 , was entering the pits when @entity33 powered out of a chicane to find the slowing @entity12 in front of him			0
he slammed on the brakes but his wheels locked up , causing the @entity7 to smash into the rear of the @entity12			0
it brought the qualifying period to an abrupt halt with stewards running onto the track to help both drivers and deal with fuel which had leaked onto the @entity54			0
both drivers emerged from their cars unscathed but were taken to the medical room as a precaution			0
the cars did not fare so well however , with both suffering serious damage			0
the @entity7 came off the worst , with the front - end badly dented , meaning it could not be moved on its own			2
the back of the @entity24 was bent out of shape by the force of the impact			2
it is now known whether the vehicles were insured , but it is feared repairs could cost more than £ 100,000			1
at the time , @entity35 was the second fastest in the @entity12 while @entity33 was 22nd			0
the @entity7 is unique , having been created by a @entity70 mechanic in the 1950s , and it is feared it will be difficult to restore to its former glory the @entity24 fared equally badly in the accident and was left with the rear badly twisted into the air and damage to both sets of wheels stewards rushed to deal with fuel which spilled onto the track and the race was stopped			1
luckily , the drivers of both cars were unharmed a statement from @entity85 said : ' there was a collision during qualifying for the @entity19 on the afternoon of saturday , march 21 , 2015 , involving car 23 , a @entity24 ' @entity11 ' driven by @entity35 and car 8 , a @entity90 300 @entity7 " @entity91 " driven by @entity6 ' following the contact between the two cars , both of which stopped close to the pit lane entrance , the session was immediately red - flagged and did not resume			1
' in line with our safety protocols , both drivers were taken to the circuit medical centre for precautionary checks and were released shortly afterwards to enjoy the remainder of the weekend			0
' unfortunately , neither car was able to be repaired in time to take part in sunday 's race and neither driver was able to take any further part in the on - track action			2
' the @entity7 started out life as a @entity7 300 @entity112 but was modified in the @entity70 in 1956 after a being involved in another serious crash			1
it was once well known in @entity70 racing circles as the ' @entity115 '			0
th accident happened at the 73rd @entity117 , in which cars from all generations are taken around the track for fans stewards were unable to move the classic @entity7 and it had to be lifted on to a tow truck before being removed from the famous circuit side - view pictures show the damage to the front of the car , which will be returned to its owner in @entity17 in a much worse state than it left			1

a unique @entity7 300 had been transported from @entity17 to be shown off at the @entity15 track on saturday
but *disaster* struck as it ploughed into the back of a 1959 @entity24 as it slowed to enter the circuit 's pit lane
fans were left stunned as the cars smashed into each other before coming to a halt , badly damaged , on the track
neither driver was badly *injured* , although it is feared the repair bill for the two cars will be well in *excess* of £ 100,000
