by @entity0 the first cream to treat erectile dysfunction is now available on prescription in the @entity4 , giving hope to those unable to take @entity7 and other treatments			1
the new cream , called @entity10 , comes in a single use , disposable applicator and is suitable for the 2.3million men over the age of 18 facing sexual function problems			1
the pre-prescribed amount of cream is applied to the tip of the penis , and once absorbed into the skin claims to produce an erection within five to 30 minutes			0
men in the @entity4 are the first in the world to have access to the new cream , which contains the drug alprostadil			2
the first cream to treat erectile dysfunction is available on prescription in the @entity4 , giving hope to the millions of men suffering sexual function issues across the country oral drugs are also often not suitable for people with angina or those who have had a stroke or a heart attack			1
they may also cause a number of generalised side effects , such as severe headaches , blurred vision and dizziness			2
in a recent survey of 250 men in the @entity4 diagnosed with @entity46 , 35 per cent suffered side effects from their taking a pill			1
however the majority of those men , 68 per cent , continued with their treatment just so they can continue to achieve an erection			0
as the cream is applied directly to the genitals these generalised side effects are considered unlikey , experts say			2
they say any side effects from using @entity10 are localised to the site of application and tend to be mild and short - lived			1
dr @entity60 , a gp in @entity62 , and president of the @entity64 , said : ' the availabilty of @entity10 is an exciting milestone in erectile dysfunction treatment			1
' many men miss out on the chance of treatment because they either can not tolerate a pill or simply do not want to take one , or are put off by the existing forms of alprostadil , such as an injection into the penis or a pellet inserted into the uretha			0
' the importance of finding the right treatment for the right person can not be underestimated			0
the cream is only available on prescription and is self - administered after verbal instructions from a healthcare professional			0
many men suffering erectile dysfunction and prescribed oral treatment , such as @entity7 , experience side effects including dizziness , severe headaches and blurred vision			1
experts say the new cream is likely to have far fewer side effects many @entity46 treatments , including @entity10 , are currently restricted on the @entity96 , meaning not all men will be deemed eligible for the treatment			1
however those who do require treatment for @entity46 but fall outside the requirements for a free @entity96 prescriptions may still be able to receive private prescriptions for the cream			0
erectile dysfunction is estimated to affect half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 at some point			2
in some cases the condition can lead to relationship issues , poor self - esteem , anxiety and depression , all of which can exacerbate the original problem			0
despite the negative impact @entity46 can have on a man 's life , another recent @entity4 study revealed 80 per cent of the 250 men questioned had problems for longer than a year before seeking help			0
experts advise seeking help from a healthcare professional as @entity46 can be an early warning sign for serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease , indicating a man could be at risk of angina or heart attack in the next three to five years .			0
