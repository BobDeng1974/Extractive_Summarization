entirely built by village locals , this is the incredible @entity2 , carved into @entity4 's @entity3			1
the tunnel , used by foot passengers as well as transport , links @entity8 with the outside world , yet just over forty years ago , things were very different			1
before 1972 a path chiselled into the rock used to be the only access linking the village to the rest of the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 of @entity4			1
the journey was a gruelling , almost vertical set of 720 mountain steps			1
a mix of tourists and transport use the @entity2 as well as admire its craftmanship the edges have some value of support - a far cry to the dangerous path of forty years ago the stairs were very dangerous because they were steep , narrow and had no handrails			2
then the villagers decided to dig a tunnel through the rocky cliff			2
led by @entity36 , head of the village , they sold goats and herbs to buy hammers and steel tools			0
thirteen villagers worked on the project and it took them five years to finish the 1,200 - metre - long tunnel , which is about five metres high and four metres wide			2
it was made to be wide enough to be driven along , during which time they used up more than 12 tons of drill rods and 4,000 hammers views from the mountain tunnel are spectacular , and are worth the driving risks the @entity2 has become a real tourist attraction known throughout @entity4 the fact that 13 workers developed the passage from start until finish leaves tourists astounded goats were sold for tools by the village builders back in the 1970s so as to progress the project on may 1 , 1977 , the tunnel was opened to traffic			1
the wall of the tunnel is uneven and there are more than 30 ' windows ' of different sizes and shapes			2
some windows are round and some are square , and they range from dozens of meters long to standard - window - size			0
as these pictures show , the tunnel has become a valid tourist attraction in @entity4 , detailing the hard work and intuition of the locals who knew advances had to be made to move with times			1
it is also one of the top ten steepest roads in the world			0
the tunnel links the village of @entity89 with the rest of the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 of @entity4 the wall of the tunnel is uneven and there are more than 30 ' windows ' of different sizes and shapes			1
the 1,200 - metre - long tunnel , which is about five metres high and four metres wide is wide enough to be driven along the @entity95 in @entity96 , is often misidentified as the @entity2 in photographs , although seemingly very different photos of the road are often misidentified with the @entity96 @entity95 , or as it has come to be known , the @entity95			1
this @entity102 route has been named by many as the world 's most dangerous road , with estimates that 200 people die there every year			0
the largely single - lane road has no guard rails and cliffs of up to 600 meters ( 2,000ft )			0
most of the road is the width of a single vehicle , about 3.2 metres ( 10ft )			0
during the rainy season from november through march , rain and fog can severely hamper visibility , and water runoff can turn the road into a muddy track , affecting traction			0
in the summer , rockfalls are common and vehicle dust limits visibility as well .			0

@entity95 *replaced* a *perilous* path that *consisted* of 720 mountain steps , and started to be built in 1972
after five years of toil and graft by just 13 villages , the new route was completed
now the tunnel is a tourist attraction throughout @entity4 , as well as a main link for @entity8
