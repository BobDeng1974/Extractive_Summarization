to his liking , @entity23 came forward and was caught by enough right - hand counters to give @entity10 the opening round			1
@entity23 was again the aggressor at the start of the second and enjoyed some success off his left jab but @entity10 was landing the heavier shots			2
@entity23 was striving to make a brawl of it at close quarters but @entity10 is a born fighter and gave better than he got to the body			2
the @entity167 was using his head as a third fist and there was the beginning of a cut by his right eye			0
but he rocked @entity23 with a succession of left hooks to move further ahead on the cards			0
@entity23 certainly had come to fight and engaged in some furious exchanges – but @entity10 ’s speed and accuracy with both hands saw him begin to alarm his challenger with combinations of a high order			2
