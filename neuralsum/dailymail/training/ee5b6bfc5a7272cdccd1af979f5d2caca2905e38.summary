logs kept by @entity21 officials reveal that vulnerable and severely ill patients are being taken to hospital in police cars after ambulances failed to arrive			1
four officers were investigated by the @entity10 after a woman died while being transported in another case a 14 - year - old girl who had overdosed on diazepam had to be taken to hospital by officers after her parents waited 80 minutes for an ambulance			1
police cars were also used to transport a father who had slit his wrists and was bleeding heavily and a woman who had crashed her car and was having heart palpitations , both in the @entity39			2
shadow health secretary @entity40 has criticised @entity41 for failing to address the crisis in another case in the @entity45 an officer was disciplined after taking a very sick woman to hospital after no ambulance was available nearby			2
the police control room had told the officer not to take the patient , who died but was later revived , and disciplined the officer for misconduct			2
the full scale of the crisis has been revealed in incident logs kept by @entity21 officials			0
one , in the @entity58 , wrote that ' during a shift of 16 officers , eight were in hospital standing by for around four hours			0

' the scandal was uncovered by a @entity69 probe and shadow health secretary @entity71 blamed @entity41 for the problems , telling @entity73 : ' he has failed to grasp the urgency of the @entity15 crisis			0
the chaos is now spreading to other emergency services			0
' the alarming fact that police cars are now doubling as makeshift ambulances is a clear sign of how bad things have got on his watch			2
' the rising use of police cars being used to take patients to hospital is in part due to the much - criticised 111 phone service leading to more patients calling 999 for help			1
the use of police vehicles has been blamed on the shambolic 111 phone service leading to more people calling 999 , and more patients walking into @entity15 to be treated leading to ambulances waiting for doctors to be free as more desperate patients preset themselves at casualty wards for treatment the ambulances which are available are waiting longer for doctors to become free			1

' they are dealing with a variety of casualties , from assault victims to those involved in traffic collisions , and often find themselves waiting for an hour or longer for paramedics to arrive			0
' government cuts to @entity122 have also placed a bigger strain upon the ambulance service			0
earlier this year it was reported that the number of patients forced to wait at least two hours parked outside @entity15 had risen by two - thirds in one year			0
