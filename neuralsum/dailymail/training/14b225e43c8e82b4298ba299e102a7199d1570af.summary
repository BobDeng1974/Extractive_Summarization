by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 07:42 est , 18 september 2013 a school has banned pupils from bringing their bikes through the gates - and is planning to demolish cycle racks to make way for more staff parking			1
children at @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity11 , have been told they now have to chain their bikes up off its premises because of health and safety concerns			1
but parents have criticised the move saying it will be dangerous for their children with more cars driving near the site and are outraged the ban has been enforced at the same time the school is building more parking spaces			1
health and safety : children from @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 who are no longer allowed onto school grounds with their bikes mother @entity28 , 32 , has three 10 - year - olds at the school and admitted she was surprised staff had taken the decision considering its ' eco ' status			1
her children normally cycle together with four others , cutting their twenty minute walk down to a five - minute bike ride			2
she said : ' the school is an eco-friendly school but has decided that children are no longer allowed to cycle to and from school , even though children have been doing this for years , including myself as a child			1
' her daughter came home and told her a teacher had announced the bike sheds were going to be taken away to make way for a new car park			0
' as soon as she told me this i called up the school and spoke to the deputy head teacher who confirmed this , ' she added			2
' this has upset a lot of children and their parents			2
childhood obesity is on the rise and promoting healthy eating and exercise is a must , ' she said			0
regulations : pupils at the school are still cycling , but the planned demolition of the bike shelter means they will have to chain them up outside ' what better way to promote this by encouraging children to cycle to school and by doing so reducing the amount of cars , making it safer for children and the environment ? ' ' the parents parking their cars outside the gates is going to cause more of a health and safety risk than a few bikes			1
' @entity86 , the mother of two children at the school , said she met with head teacher @entity89 to discuss the policy			2
' i said to mrs @entity89 , " it ’s absolutely ridiculous			0
" she said it ’s a health and safety issue			0
my kids rode yesterday , to make a stand really			0
i ’m hoping they have n’t been told off			0
' banned : staff at @entity9 say the rules have been brought in because of health and safety concerns the school holds a cycling safety course each year when pupils bring their bikes to school for three weeks			1
mrs @entity86 added : ' i also asked if safety measures are to be put into place for this short time , why ca n’t they be put into place permanently ? this apparently is n’t an option			0
' headteacher @entity89 said : ' we are currently working alongside the council ’s @entity114 and @entity115 teams to review the situation and complete risk assessment and traffic survey of the school site			1
' ensuring the safety and well being of our pupils remains our utmost priority , and we are seeking to resolve this issue as soon as possible			2
' a spokeswoman for @entity126 said the council did not want to issue an official statement , adding : ' i ’m aware of the situation			0
it ’s a school policy rather than a @entity133 - wide policy and it ’s at the discretion of the school			0

children at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , will not be allowed to ride their bikes on the site
pupils will now have to chain their bikes up away from the school if they want to carry on riding
headteacher says the safety and *wellbeing* of the pupils is her priority
