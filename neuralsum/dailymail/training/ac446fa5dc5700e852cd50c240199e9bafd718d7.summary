@entity1 defender @entity0 admits the forthcoming warm - weather training break is a chance for players to generate a greater team spirit			1
a dire goalless draw at home to @entity8 extended the @entity1 ' win-less run to eight matches and the @entity12 left - back accepts the growing criticism may have led some players to look after themselves			1
cracks seemed to appear against the @entity8 when @entity16 stepped up to take a penalty - traditionally the role of @entity0 with 15 successful conversions from 16 - and hit the post			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity16 speaking ahead of the penalty at @entity22 on monday night @entity16 misses from the penalty spot having stolen the ball from usual penalty taker @entity0 forwards @entity26 and @entity27 tried to persuade the @entity28 international he was making a mistake and after his failure @entity27 could be seen publicly questioning his international team - mate with manager @entity32 on the touchline			1
with no @entity38 action this weekend the squad are heading overseas for an intensive few days training and that break may now be more important than ever			1
" it is like a mini pre-season in a way , " said @entity0			1
" we have been spending a lot of time together anyway but to go away is a nice change of scenery			2
@entity27 ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity48 and @entity26 ( right ) takes a breather " hopefully it gets a bit more spirit among the lads and keeps everyone together because when you are not winning games and there is a lot of criticism it is easy to look after yourself			1
" we have to stay together and look after each other and hopefully this trip will be beneficial in all those ways			2
" the players will be challenged in a number of areas while they are away , not least in terms of why they have fallen so far off the pace they set last season			2
" it is similar to what we did last season			2
we 'll have some hard sessions in the morning and some tactical stuff in the afternoon , " he told evertontv			2
@entity1 's @entity79 ( right ) and @entity8 's @entity81 battle for the ball " it is a chance to go away , take a step back and look at where we are going wrong because we are going wrong at the moment and it gives us more time together to put things right , " the intention is to have more opportunity to put more work in and cover some more points that we need to address so hopefully it will be beneficial			1
" @entity22 has so often been @entity1 's stronghold but this season they have taken just 14 points from 11 matches and the @entity8 display was arguably the worst seen at home under @entity32			1
pressure is growing on @entity1 manager @entity32 following their poor run of form @entity102 is becoming more audible by the week but the @entity1 boss could not say whether that was impacting on the players			1
" it is difficult to answer that			0
we all share the same frustration , " he said			0
" we want to win the game and perform well			0
the players had the perfect attitude and mindset that allowed us to control the game			0
" you do n't see many games in the @entity117 when the opposition has no shots on target			0
" the second half we all got frustrated , the players to the crowd and vice-versa			0
" @entity125 issues instructions to @entity127 from the touchline during the monday night draw with @entity1 the penalty furore took much of the focus away from another well - drilled @entity8 performance which had all the hallmarks of new manager @entity125			1
since he took over earlier this month they have not conceded a goal in three matches and the former @entity139 and @entity140 boss is still unbeaten			0
" as a group you ca n't criticise them in any shape , " @entity125 said			0
" everybody has bought into what we are trying to do			0
" this is a real struggle down at the bottom			0
there are so many good teams down there and i think it will go to the wire			0
" @entity125 ( right ) gets vocal on the touchline next to @entity32 as both sides look for a winner			0

@entity1 hope mini training camp will bring the squad back together
fans *reacted* badly to @entity1 's home draw with @entity8 on monday
cracks started to show as @entity16 hit the post with a penalty
@entity171 *midfielder* took the ball away from penalty taker @entity0
@entity175 : @entity16 ' *refusal* to let @entity0 take penalty was *despicable*
