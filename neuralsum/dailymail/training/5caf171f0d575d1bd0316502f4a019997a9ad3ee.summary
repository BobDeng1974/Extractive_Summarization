lights out : the @entity2 has ok 'd changes made to labels of brands of the sleep drug zolpidem at its own behest the regulator said that women were more susceptible to the risk because they eliminate the drug from the blood more slowly than men			1
approved changes also include a lowered dose recommendation			0
the agency said that research had shown that the drugs remain in the bloodstream at levels high enough to interfere with morning driving , which increases the risk of car accidents			0
