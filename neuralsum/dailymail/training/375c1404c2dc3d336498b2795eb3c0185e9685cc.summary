when word reached @entity2 that @entity3 was about to raise the @entity6 quota at @entity7 this summer , he immediately cast himself in the role of protective big brother			1
as a 21 - year - old , @entity2 had felt the weight of the world on his shoulders when he moved from @entity14 to @entity15 in 2008			1
his fellow @entity16 , he sincerely believed , would need all the free advice going as he embarked on life in the @entity19			2
ten weeks on from extending a welcoming handshake to the former @entity23 full - back at the @entity24 , @entity2 ’ fears for @entity3 have long since evaporated			1
@entity3 has taken to the @entity19 like a duck to water since joining from @entity23 @entity3 played for @entity27 during their @entity29 2015 qualifiers last year to say the player has taken to the task like a duck to water is to do him a huge disservice			1
the same goes for his ascent to the @entity37 team			1
from playing with @entity39 at @entity40 to eyeing @entity41 at @entity42 in a @entity37 shirt in little over a year , @entity3 ’s story would normally be reserved for the pages of a child ’s comic			1
as for the surrogate big brother , fulsome praise has long since replaced those early words of advice			2
‘ he ’s a very level - headed lad , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ as he ’s @entity6 , you feel it ’s your duty when he comes down to make sure he ’s okay			1
‘ there ’s only so much you can do but he ’s dealt with everything @entity60 has thrown at him - some big tests			1
you always hear about whether someone can cut it at the top			2
well the only way to find out is to give them a chance			2
the manager has done that so fair play to him and fair play to @entity55 for taking it			2
‘ when @entity70 did come down , the first thing i told him was to believe that he could cut it there			2
you go in there with no fear like he did , and show people what you can do			2
he ’s got a great left foot and the way he attacks is terrific			2
he ’s learning each day and that ’s good			2
he ’s in the gym working hard on his upper body and physique			2
@entity3 ( right ) alongside his @entity6 teammate @entity82 ( left ) last weekend @entity3 ( right ) played a starring role in @entity7 's win over @entity85 at the @entity24 last week ‘ it can only be good for @entity37 when lads like that come through			1
he ’s got a big future ahead of him			0
you see him on tv and he stands out straight away			0
some lads are shell - shocked by the occasion and that ’s one thing he ’s not			1
” a serious knee injury sustained on his @entity7 debut means @entity2 can do no more than roar himself hoarse at @entity42 this evening			1
if the mental anguish at being excluded from the opening four games of the @entity101 qualifying campaign has been comparable with the physical pain of dislocating his knee at @entity104 , the 27 - year - old has taken considerable comfort in the way @entity107 and his players have dealt with his misfortune			1
‘ every one of the lads in the squad has wished me all the best since my injury , ’ he added			0
‘ most of them have been through something similar and the manager has also been on the phone , trying to get me to the team hotel and to sit in on the meetings			1
‘ that shows the character of the man			0
he wants us all to feel part of it and i take my hat off to him			0
‘ it feels like a club whenever we meet up and that bodes well for the future			0
we might only meet five or six times each year but we ’ve kept the core of the squad together , with just a few additions here and there			1
@entity3 ( left ) , alongside @entity138 ( centre ) and @entity140 ( right ) after @entity23 's win against @entity142 in the @entity143 semi-final at @entity42 in april 2014 - just months before the @entity7 man 's move south ‘ the manager has worked to get that spirit and whenever anyone new comes into the group he ’s the first one to make sure that they ’re involved			1
‘ he tells them : “ listen , you need to be part of this because we ’ve got something going here so get in there and start bonding ” — and that ’s what happens			0
’ it could be said that @entity107 owes @entity2 more than any other			1
it was , after all , his winning goal in @entity163 a year past in june that began to turn the tanker around			1
the subsequent progress made has meant the tangible feeling of optimism ahead of the match this evening now has a sound grounding in reality			1
reflecting on that night in @entity172 , @entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t know if that was just the crazy @entity174 mentality or whether it was down to the feel - good factor and the confidence that the gaffer has bred in us all			1
that patriotic thing comes out and you think : “ we can do this ”			0
‘ it ’s like @entity186 players coming out and saying that they used to beat opposing teams in the tunnel because they could see the fear in their faces			0
‘ when you have the belief that we have now then you give yourself a better chance of winning games			0
‘ so many times over the years you must have sat and interviewed @entity37 players and thought : “ this is the same old story here ”			1
@entity3 in action for @entity37 's senior team in a friendly against @entity203 at @entity204 ‘ but now i ’m sure you ’re thinking that this is our time , that you can see signs that we ’re making progress here			1
’ the epitome of @entity107 ’s ‘ @entity214 ’ doctrine , @entity2 typically parks his personal difficulties to talk up his belief in those who will face @entity41 tonight			1
but there ’s no escaping that it ’s been hard			0
for a player who hardly knew what a day without training or a week without a game was , the first serious injury of his career felt like someone switching off a light			0
‘ it ’s quite difficult not being part of things , ’ he admitted			0
‘ there ’s no better feeling when you cross that white line , that childhood feeling comes out in you that you ’re playing football			2
‘ for that 90 minutes you ’re free , you do what you do and that ’s what you ’ve worked all week for			0
that side of things i am missing			0
‘ i ’ll be honest , it ’s been tough			0
but i ’ll approach it each day at a time			0
i have n’t had big injuries , this is the first one			0
‘ it ’s been really hard especially when you ’ve got family and such			0
anyone living with a footballer will tell you it ’s difficult because one thing can set you over the edge			0
‘ down there they ’ve got a lot of psychologists which is really good because you can speak to people and talk to them			0
‘ i ’ve seen many players come out saying through injuries they ’ve hit depression			0
i do n’t want that for me			0
‘ that ’s why i ’m focusing on things , being the best person i can be and trying to give everything each day in my recovery			0

when @entity3 made the move down from @entity23 to @entity7 , @entity2 wanted to make sure he *settled* in properly
now , @entity2 admits his work is done as @entity3 has proven himself
@entity2 thinks @entity3 is a ' level - headed lad ' that has dealt well with everything that @entity7 boss @entity60 has thrown at him
in under a year , @entity3 has gone from playing with @entity39 to eyeing a place in the @entity37 team to face @entity41 on *saturday*
