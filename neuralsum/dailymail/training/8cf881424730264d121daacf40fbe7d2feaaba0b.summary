@entity9 convinced his patient and her husband that she did not need further treatment by insisting she was cured for two years after the failed operation at @entity13 in september 2008			1
he then lied to colleagues and forged documents to keep up the deception , the @entity14 has heard			1
when @entity0 told her the lesion had ‘ recurred ’ in 2010 she then decided to seek private treatment , which was partially successful , but the tumour was inoperable			1
@entity0 did not attend the professional disciplinary hearing in @entity23 , which resumed today after a three month delay			2
the fitness to practise panel , chaired by dr @entity27 , ruled the doctor may have genuinely believed he had removed the lesion			0
but he was found guilty of misleading and dishonest conduct for trying to cover his tracks when he realised this was not the case			0
the panel today found him guilty of serious misconduct and ruled his fitness to practise medicine was impaired as a result			0
@entity0 ’s name will be erased from the @entity41 ’s register of doctors in 28 days , subject to his legal right of appeal , although the panel decided to impose an immediate order of suspension so he ca n’t work during that time			2
the case had heard that after developing double vision on holiday in november 2007 , the woman - known as @entity52 - consulted her optician and was referred to the @entity13			1
an mri scan revealed a tumour about one inch in diameter in an area in her brain known as the cavernous sinus and she saw @entity0 to discuss her options in june 2008			1
she decided to go ahead with an operation and underwent surgery at the hands of @entity0 on september 2 , 2008			1
giving evidence earlier , @entity52 said : ‘ there was something going on inside my head and i really needed to find out what it is so mr @entity0 offered me that			2
‘ if there was a good chance of removing the tumour that ’s fantastic			0
that ’s how i felt			0
‘ he explained how he would open up my head and try to remove the tumour and obviously the biopsy would be taken and sent to the pathologist and we would find out what type of tumour it is			0
’ after the operation mr @entity0 told her it had been a success and explained to her husband that he had removed ‘ 100 per cent ’ of the tumour			1
but he only removed four tiny hard pale fragments , which could not even be used to determine what the tumour was as they were ‘ non-diagnostic samples ’			1
but the operation at @entity13 ( pictured ) in 2008 had failed			1
he then lied to colleagues and forged documents to keep up the deception , the @entity14 has heard @entity52 said : ‘ he said it ’s all gone			1
he said it was just calcium deposits			0
that ’s how he described it			0
’ @entity0 then sent letters to the patient ’s gp telling him that no further treatment was necessary			1
in january 2009 , the surgeon altered a pathology report and sent a forged copy to his patient in order to conceal the fact she might need further treatment			1
in may 2010 he told her he did not know the tumour was present when he operated on her and gave her another doctored pathology report with the author ’s signature ‘ cut and pasted ’ in			2
opening the case @entity115 , had earlier told the hearing : ‘ this is a case where it is difficult to understand why mr @entity0 initially told the patient and her husband that he had completely removed the lesion when he must have known that no such thing had happened			1
‘ he then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure and the @entity41 will therefore invite you to conclude that is what has happened			0
’ @entity52 made a complaint , and the hospital ’s medical director ordered an investigation - but the doctor was able to continue working until october last year , when he took early retirement			0
when quizzed about his actions during an internal disciplinary meeting in january 2011 , @entity0 admitted his deception but said ‘ he did not want to cause further stress to the patient , ’ the tribunal heard			1
@entity142 chairman dr @entity27 said : ‘ the panel considers that mr @entity0 ’s misconduct put patient a at serious risk of harm , he abused his position of trust and he violated @entity52 ’s rights			2
‘ the panel is satisfied that mr @entity0 ’s conduct constitutes a very serious departure from the fundamental tenets of good medical practice			2
‘ whilst the panel accepts that mr @entity0 ’s misconduct relates to a single episode it is concerned that his dishonest behaviour was persistent and covered up			2
dr @entity27 said : ‘ the panel considers that mr @entity0 has displayed a reckless disregard for the principles set out in good medical practice			0
‘ the panel is of the view that patients and the public are entitled to expect medical practitioners to act with integrity			0
‘ it considers that mr @entity0 has abused the position of trust which the public are entitled to place int he medical profession and that his behavior is unacceptable and fundamentally incompatible with his continued registration			0
’ dr @entity27 explained that the panel had taken into account @entity0 ’s ‘ long and distinguished career ’ into account , including a period where he was the only surgeon involved in spinal intra-medullary lesions in the @entity180 of @entity181			0
but his misconduct was so serious , the chairman said , that it was fundamentally incompatible with him continuing to work as a doctor			0
‘ the panel is of the view that mr @entity0 ’s behaviour would be regarded as deplorable by fellow practitioners and by the public			0
