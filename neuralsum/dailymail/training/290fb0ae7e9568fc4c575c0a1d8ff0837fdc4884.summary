by @entity0 published : 08:17 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 14 may 2013 this is the jaw - dropping moment the sun experiences one of its largest solar storms of the year as particles are blasted out at 1,200 miles per second			1
solar flares , which are the greatest explosive events we experience , take place on the @entity9 when energy stored in twisted magnetic fields is suddenly released			1
the bursts of radiation are n't a threat to humans , although when powerful enough they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			0
this image of the flare , shown in the upper left corner , was captured by @entity29 's @entity28 solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation			1
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity36 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground			0
however , when intense enough they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel			2
this disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing , anywhere from minutes to hours			0
@entity29 has now released images of a series of violent explosions over the weekend - where it recorded the two largest flares of the year			1
they were classified as ' @entity52 ' flares , which are the most intense recorded on the @entity54 - style scale			1
the first , on may 12 , was a 1.7 , followed by a 2.8 on may 13			0
the flares happened at the same time as a series of coronal mass ejections , which are solar phenomenons where billions of tons of particles are blasted into space			1
research from @entity29 's @entity28 showed the @entity62 spewed particles out at a staggering 745 miles per second - the equivalent of 4.32 million miles per hour			1
these spectacular events can affect electronic systems in satellites and on the ground , but there was no threat as the ejection was n't @entity36 directed			0
the sun erupted with an @entity74 solar flare on may 12 , 2013			2
this is a blend of two images of the flare from @entity29 's @entity28 : one image shows light in the 171 - angstrom wavelength , the other in 131 angstroms			2
however , staff working on the @entity83 and @entity84 spacecraft have been warned the coronal mass ejections may brush past them , interfering with their operations			0
the @entity9 is currently coming to the end of its solar cycle , which is a period of low and high activity which repeats approximately every 11 years			0
there have been 16 x-class eruptions this year			0
the largest on the current cycle was a staggering 6.9 , which took place on august 9 , 2011 .			2

flares are first to be classified as ' @entity52 ' , the most intense , of 2013
@entity99 particles out at a staggering 745 miles per second - the equivalent of 4.32 million miles per hour
