ever since he turned professional @entity0 has passed away the time on his first flight each year by marking down his goals for the season on the back of his boarding pass			1
and while the seat numbers have got progressively lower — this year ’s targets are written on the back of @entity9 — his targets are now so sky - high he did n’t even tick them all off last season , when he won two majors			1
‘ still a pretty good year , though , ’ he said , with tongue firmly in cheek			2
@entity0 ( right ) and caddie @entity17 ( left ) know all roads lead to the masters at @entity20 in april @entity21 ( third left ) , @entity23 ( third right ) and @entity25 ( second right ) joined @entity0 @entity0 posted a picture of himself with @entity27 and the caption ' two best bar men at the @entity30 ' this year the list extends to seven items and while he has no intention of making them public — that really would be making a rod for his own back — you can be pretty sure that the first two will be to complete the career @entity40 at the masters in april and defend his @entity43 title in july on his favourite course , @entity45			1
‘ the boarding pass stays in the wallet and then on the last flight of the year i take it out and see how well i ’ve done , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’ve never managed to achieve all my goals in any year , so i aim pretty high			1
but it ’s good to see the seat numbers are coming down			0
it was @entity54 and then @entity54 and so on and now it ’s down to @entity9			0
i guess the ultimate goal is to have a boarding pass with no seat number on it at all			0
’ if truth be told , @entity0 is now comfortably in the income bracket where he could fly the world by private jet , and invariably does for anything but long - haul flights			1
but there is one blot on the horizon threatening to blow a nasty hole in that wallet , both in terms of income and his season ’s goals			2
@entity0 is hoping to go even better this year than his @entity43 and @entity76 wins of 2014 @entity0 's swing looked to be in good shape in a @entity80 video he posted last week it concerns the bitter court case looming with his former management company @entity83			1
@entity0 is both suing and being countersued , with the result being he is likely to spend a good deal of next month in a @entity87 courtroom , including a lengthy spell on the witness stand			1
given what is at stake — @entity0 stands to lose tens of millions of pounds if the judgment goes against him — you might think it has the potential to be a serious distraction with the masters just around the corner			1
if so , @entity0 did a pretty good job of disguising it			1
‘ why would it distract me ? ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve just got to get up there and tell the truth			0
i ’ve literally not thought about it since whenever it was that i last had to talk to someone about it			0
it ’s no big deal			0
i will be ok at the end of the day			0
’ in fact , when it comes to distractions regarding the masters , when he will be trying to win a third successive major , he is more wary of the hype that will inevitably grow as the big week draws closer			1
to that end , he will change his routine of playing the week before at the @entity43			0
aware he would hardly get a moment ’s peace , @entity117 will now see him play in the @entity120 in @entity121 in mid-march instead , giving him a fortnight away from the spotlight to prepare for @entity20			0
‘ it might change in the sense if i feel i need some tournament golf i will definitely go to @entity127 , but that ’s my thinking at the minute , ’ said @entity0			2
also in his thinking is starting the year off with a victory			2
for the eighth year in a row , @entity0 is kicking off here at the @entity133 @entity132 , which starts on thursday , and a rare furrow creases his brow when he recalls the various self - inflicted ways he has managed to keep himself out of the winner ’s circle			1
the @entity139 looked in good spirits during his press conference in @entity142 on tuesday morning @entity0 is looking forward to defending his @entity43 title , which will be staged at @entity45 in 2015 winning the masters at @entity20 is 25 - year - old 's primary objective this season take last year , when he picked up the daftest of two - shot penalties for failing to take full relief from ground under repair and lost out to @entity152			1
or 2012 , when another two - shot penalty for brushing away sand that was not on the green cost him the trophy			2
‘ keeping the right side of the rule book would certainly help , ’ was @entity0 ’s laconic response			2
‘ i definitely feel like there ’s some unfinished business with this tournament , and i ’m looking forward to getting out there			0
after what i achieved last year , i feel like i am going into this season with momentum			0
’ not to mention a golden ticket containing a seven - point plan to rule the world once more .			0
