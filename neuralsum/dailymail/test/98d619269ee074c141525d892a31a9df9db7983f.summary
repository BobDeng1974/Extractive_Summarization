a robot has been ' arrested ' by @entity2 police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the ' dark net '			1
the automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $ 100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web			1
the robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of @entity20 , in north east @entity2			1
the @entity21 purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web ( pictured ) including trainers , jeans , cigarettes , a set of masterkeys and a dvd case ( far left ) containing 10 ecstasy tablets the items it bought included a pair of @entity36 trainers , counterfeit designer jeans , the scan of a @entity40 passport and a set of @entity44 @entity43 masterkeys			1
however , it seems the @entity21 crossed the line when it purchased 10 ecstasy tablets , which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a dvd case			1
the dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media			1
most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites , unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines , which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea , missing much of the information in the depths			0
the dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods , but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity			2
the @entity74 website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins , the electronic currency			0
other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs , hacked information , credit card numbers and other illegal goods			2
the @entity74 used an underground computer network known as the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) , which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users			0
it uses numerous layers of security and encryption , hiding the ip address and the activity of the user			0
just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the @entity44 accesses this hidden part of the internet			1
police seized the drugs , the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased			1
tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class - a drug mdma , which the police then destroyed			2
the computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot , ! @entity119 , along with the other items it bought			1
they described the police 's actions as an ' unjustified intervention into the freedom of art '			0
writing on their blog , @entity130 based artists @entity126 and @entity128 , who were behind the project , said : ' @entity21 has finally been released and is now back in our possession			2
' at the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution			0
' in the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of @entity140 was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition			0
' the public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work @entity21 justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts , even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited			2
' we as well as the @entity21 have been cleared of all charges			0
this is a great day for the bot , for us and for freedom of art ! ' the @entity21 project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use			1
it used @entity168 to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet			0
the tablets , pictured above , were sent from @entity173 inside a dvd case and a vacuum sealed foil bag they were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the @entity182 in @entity20			1
during the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake @entity185 handbag , a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 @entity189 cigarettes			2
the darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous			0
the ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of @entity140 and were destroyed by the @entity2 authorities it has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography , drugs and weapons			1
the robot software bought the ecstasy in october			2
it was sent from @entity173 to @entity2 and apparently crossed the border hidden in a dvd case without being intercepted by the authorities			1
the drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in january			0
however , the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties			1
speaking to the @entity219 , mr @entity128 said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself , they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software			0
the case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet			0
in the past the artists have used technology to intercept @entity236 images and sent a package to @entity239 founder @entity238			0
mr @entity128 and @entity240 said : ' the @entity21 is a live @entity242 piece , an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there			0

@entity21 is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net
@entity2 police seized bot after it purchased 10 ecstasy tablets from @entity173
it was later released ' without charge ' according to the artists behind the bot
they designed it as part of an art exhibition to display items bought by the robot over the dark net including trainers , a passport scan and cigarettes
