' the comprehensive search by the @entity51 [ aircraft ] the last couple of days has indicated that if the yacht was still afloat they would have seen it in the search area			0
so we are assuming that it 's not in the search area and thus probably had a catastrophic event			1
' @entity7 , his wife @entity34 , 60 , and son @entity7 , 17 , left @entity61 in the @entity62 in @entity6 aboard the schooner on may 29			2

friends of the crew got in touch with @entity18 soon after that , and alerted authorities on june 14			0

@entity24 teams are now looking for evidence of wreckage			0
authorities say the storm three weeks ago saw winds gusting up to 110 kilometers ( 68 miles ) per hour and waves of up to 8 meters ( 26 feet )			0

@entity6 @entity24 has conducted an extensive search of the country 's coastline and turned up no sign of the missing schooner @entity8 or its crew
rescue officers have ' grave fears ' for the seven crew members
the @entity8 has n't been seen or heard from since asking for advice on how to get away from a storm on june 4
the crew did not send out sos messages or activate the locator beacon - but rescuers say the boat could have suffered a ' catastrophic event ' and sunk before they had time
despite fears , rescue officers have not given up hope of finding survivors and say it would be ' *unusual* ' for the *sturdy* boat to sink in a storm like the one encountered
