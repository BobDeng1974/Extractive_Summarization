@entity0 has cautioned against complacency as @entity3 look to back up their defeat of @entity5 against @entity6 this weekend			1
@entity3 claimed a surprise 29 - 15 over the @entity5 , who had beaten world champions @entity10 in their prior test a month earlier			1
@entity6 proved challenging opposition for @entity3 at the 2007 @entity13 - @entity3 eventually prevailing 14 - 10 - and that @entity15 contest has been spoken about this week			1
@entity0 ( left ) congratulates @entity16 after his try at the @entity18 in @entity19 on saturday @entity0 , who on tuesday signed a three - year extension to his @entity22 contract to remain at @entity23 until june 2018 , said : ' confidence is a brilliant thing and sometimes over-confidence can be a detrimental thing			1
' it is key we find the balance there between the two and by no means we get carried away with one victory over a @entity36 team who played poorly on the day and did n't really seem that the defeat hurt them after the game			0
' the scalp of getting a southern hemisphere team and the confidence it 'll bring to our team as a whole is probably the biggest benefit of the whole thing			0
' we are very aware of just what was achieved on the day but by no means losing the run of ourselves and getting ahead of our station			0
' i think @entity5 played poorly enough and certainly there 's a lot of work - ons from our performance too			1
' changes may be required following the @entity5 victory , with centre @entity59 to undergo further assessment on a sprained foot on wednesday			2
@entity59 ( left ) and @entity63 impressed together in the centres against @entity5 team manager @entity65 said : ' @entity59 is going to have further medical assessment and scans tomorrow			2
' we 'll know a little bit better after that			0
at the moment there 's no detail on his chances of being fit for either @entity6 or @entity76			1
' it may be @entity59 is kept in reserve even if he is fit to play @entity6 on sunday			2
@entity80 @entity79 ( calf ) and flanker @entity82 ( severe migraine ) are unlikely to feature against the @entity84 and four players have been added to the @entity3 training group in @entity88 - centre @entity87 , @entity89 back @entity90 , @entity23 tighthead @entity91 and @entity93 , the @entity89 back row			1
best has resumed running and could be back to face the @entity76			2
@entity65 added : ' it might be more prudent to give him a few more days to recover just to make sure he is right			0
' a more realistic target might be @entity76 but he has n't been ruled out of sunday			0
' veteran lock @entity97 rises to win lineout ball against @entity5 's @entity99 on saturday @entity3 are determined to carry the momentum from the victory over the @entity5 and full - back @entity0 expects head coach @entity103 to make tactical alterations to front up to a @entity6 side reliant on a fearsome forward pack			1
' we have an ability as players to play lots of different types of game plans and we 've got a fantastic coaching squad who are able to manipulate a specific type of game plan based on the opposition we are playing , ' @entity0 added			2
' @entity5 and @entity6 are two very different teams so i would imagine our game plan will vary a little bit			1
' they 're a good team and they have a huge pack			0
a lot , if not all of them , are playing @entity128 and @entity129 rugby			0
@entity0 gets ready to clear the ball upfield during @entity3 's impressive win over @entity5 ' okay , a lot of their backs are homegrown players , but they do have the potential to be dangerous players			1
' like his full - back , @entity103 will not be satisfied with the @entity5 win			1
' he 's trying to make us winners every single week , to improve our performance on a weekly basis , ' @entity0 added			1
' he 's trying to make us that 80 - minute plus team , which is something we probably have n't been a lot over the last decade or so			2
' it ( beating @entity5 ) gives us that confidence to take on @entity151 teams			0
' that is huge for our mental ability going into a game , knowing we can genuinely compete and beat the best teams in the world			0
' the full back celebrates as @entity3 score another try against their stunned opponents the 29 - year - old committed his future to @entity23 on tuesday , but had no intention of leaving to play elsewhere			1
' it was always a case of staying here , ' he said			0
' i 've no reason to leave			0
i 'm very happy here , i 'm part of two fantastic teams			0
' i 'm playing with all my friends and we 're still competing heavily in a lot of competitions so there was never a need for me to consider moving anywhere else			0
