@entity1 chairman @entity0 said firms were not operating in an ‘ ethical manner ’ private firms which ripped off taxpayers to the tune of millions of pounds were handing their managers profit - related bonuses worth up to half their salaries , mps have said			1
big businesses given public sector contracts were condemned by the @entity1 for a culture of ‘ profit - driven performance incentives ’			1
such bonuses meant managers could be encouraged to manipulate performance data , the committee heard , which could allow them to falsely claim they reached targets , for example			0
last year @entity21 and @entity22 were exposed for overcharging the @entity23 by tens of millions of pounds for electronic tagging of criminals , including some who were dead , in jail or had left the country			1
both have since agreed to repay vast sums			0
written evidence provided by @entity22 showed the most senior managers ’ bonuses could be up to half their salary			1
up to 40 per cent of the sum was related to profits extracted from the contract and 20 per cent from growth			0
other managers could receive bonuses of up to a quarter of their salary			0
up to half of that bonus was linked to the profits extracted from the contracts			2
details of @entity21 performance bonuses were not handed to the committee			2
its report exposed how the firms continued to be awarded @entity53 work even while under investigation by the @entity55			2
the @entity4 said this showed the ‘ dependence ’ of @entity53 departments on the major outsourcing companies			0
as a result of overcharging , @entity22 has agreed to pay back £ 109million to the public purse and @entity21 almost £ 70million			1
the most senior civil servant at the @entity23 , dame @entity63 , told the committee there was now a ban on contracts containing bonus schemes which encouraged staff to manipulate data or ‘ game the contract ’			1
@entity0 , the committee ’s chairman said outsourcing firms were not operating in an ‘ ethical manner ’ , adding : ‘ the legitimate pursuit of profit does not justify the illegitimate failure to conduct the business in an ethical manner			1
dame @entity63 told the committee there was now a ban on contracts containing bonus schemes which encouraged staff to manipulate data ‘ a culture of revenue and profit driven performance incentives has too often been misaligned with the needs of the public who fund and depend on these services			1
‘ departments have … placed too much trust in contractors and relied too much on the information contractors supply			0
’ the report found the government was over-reliant on a small number of contractors to provide around £ 90billion of public spending – half of all its expenditure on goods and services			1
that amounts to half of all government spending on goods and services			0
poor contract management left taxpayers paying ‘ outdated costs ’ and firms making ‘ excessive profits ’ , the report added			2
the report said ministers created the impression that all business with the firms had been suspended after the tagging scandal emerged			0
but in reality , the @entity23 , the @entity123 the @entity122 , the @entity120 and @entity121 all continued to award them more work while fraud investigations were going on			0
two other @entity22 contracts with the @entity23 have been referred for investigations and a @entity21 contract is being probed by the @entity130			1
@entity21 ’s was also found to have altered performance data on a contract for out - of - hours gp services in @entity134			2
the @entity23 said bonus schemes for contractors which encouraged them to game the contract would not be permitted in future .			0
