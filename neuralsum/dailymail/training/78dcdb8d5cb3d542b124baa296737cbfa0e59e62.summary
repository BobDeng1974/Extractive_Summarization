monkey calls are far more sophisticated than previously thought - and the primates can even form basic ' sentences ' to communicate			2
researchers even found the same species of monkeys located in separate geographic regions use their alarm calls differently to warn of approaching predators , a linguistic analysis by a team of scientists reveals			1
the study , which appears in the journal @entity14 , reveals that monkey calls have a more sophisticated structure than was commonly thought			2
@entity17 's monkeys have a distinction between roots and suffixes , which allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of dange ' hok ' warns of serious aerial threats - usually eagles - ' hok - oo ' can be used for a variety of general aerial disturbances ; in effect the suffix - oo serves as a kind of attenuator			1
' krak ' usually functions as a leopard alarm call in @entity36 , but as a general alarm call – to warn of all sorts of disturbances , including eagles – on @entity41 ' our findings show that @entity17 's monkeys have a distinction between roots and suffixes , and that their combination allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of danger , ' said the study 's lead author , @entity51 of @entity54 's @entity53 ( @entity53 ) and a global distinguished professor at @entity56			1
the combined team of linguists and primatologists analyzed alarm calls of @entity17 's monkeys on two sites : the @entity63 in @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity66			1
notably , monkey predators on the two sites differ : the primates are threatened by eagles on @entity65 and by eagles and leopards in the @entity63			0
using transcriptions of these monkey calls gathered in field experiments involving playbacks of predator calls ( e.g. eagle shrieks and leopard growls ) , the researchers found greater complexity in expression than previously understood as well as differences in alarm calls between the two locations			1
their analysis showed that these calls make a distinction between roots ( especially ' hok ' and ' krak ' ) and suffixes ( - oo ) , and that their combination allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of danger			1
for instance , ' hok ' warns of serious aerial threats — usually eagles — whereas ' hok - oo ' can be used for a variety of general aerial disturbances ; in effect the suffix - oo serves as a kind of attenuator			2
moreover , their results suggest that the calls are not used in the same way in the @entity63 and on @entity65			0
for instance , ' krak ' usually functions as a leopard alarm call in @entity36 , but as a general alarm call – to warn of all sorts of disturbances , including eagles – on @entity114			0
the article seeks to explain why this ' dialectal variation ' is found			0
the combined team of linguists and primatologists analyzed alarm calls of @entity17 's monkeys on two sites : the @entity63 in @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity66			1
the authors ' preferred analysis is based on the device of ' implicatures , ' borrowed from the pragmatics of human languages			0
it posits that the meaning of a word can be enriched when it competes with a more informative alternative – for instance , ' possible ' competes with ' certain , ' which is more informative , and for this reason ' possible ' usually comes to mean ' possible but not certain ' ( for instance in : ' it 's possible that @entity136 is the culprit ' – which implies that this is not a certainty )			0
the authors propose that ' krak ' always has a meaning of general alarm , but that in @entity36 it comes to be enriched by competition with ' hok ' ( meaning : aerial threat ) and ' krak - oo ' ( meaning : weak threat ) – with the result that it is enriched with a ' not ' hok ' ' component ( hence : the threat is a non-aerial threat ) and a ' not ' krak - oo ' ' component ( hence : the threat is not weak )			2
this yields a meaning of a ' serious ground - related threat , ' closely associated with leopards			0
in the long term , @entity51 observes , the research should help initiate the development of a form of ' primate linguistics ' — the application of sophisticated methods from contemporary formal linguistics to systems of animal communication .			0

researchers studied @entity17 monkeys in @entity66 and @entity64
found complex alarm calls can describe predator and level of danger
found both had same basic alarm calls - but using different ' dialects '
