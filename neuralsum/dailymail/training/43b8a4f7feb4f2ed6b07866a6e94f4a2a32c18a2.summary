a teenager who was sentenced to 25 years and would have served some time in adult prison after pleading guilty aged 12 to helping kill a friend 's stepfather could leave a juvenile prison as early as next summer under a deal with prosecutors			1

he could serve that time in a maximum - security facility if he gets in trouble , or in a group home , community corrections , on probation or even on parole if he 's well - behaved			1
@entity8 will remain at @entity33 until he achieves his high school diploma in the prison school around summer 2014 , according to indystar.com			1
then the teenager will be transferred to a residential treatment facility and begin college classes			0
he will likely stay there until he is 18			0
at that age , he could be released on probation under the new deal - as long as he keeps up the good behavior			0
' he committed a serious crime			0
but to send him to adult prison would guarantee we will create a criminal , ' said his attorney @entity49			0
the law does allow a judge to drop all supervision , but @entity49 told judge @entity53 that the plea agreement does n't allow for that for @entity8			1
the case involves the fatal shooting of 49 - year - old @entity58 on april 20 , 2010 , in his home near @entity60 , about halfway between @entity61 and @entity62			1

@entity8 , who was a sixth - grader at @entity89 at the time of the shooting , pleaded guilty in november 2010 to conspiracy to commit murder			1
the new plea agreement was worked out after the @entity95 last year threw out @entity8 's guilty plea and sentence , saying @entity88 superior judge @entity98 rushed when he waived the case to adult court			1

the law calls for a judge to hold a hearing as soon as possible after @entity8 turns 18 to determine where he should be placed based on the rehabilitative programs he has completed and how he has behaved			2
@entity49 said the new law has worked well for @entity8 but that some defense attorneys fear it could lead to more youths being waived to adult court .			2
