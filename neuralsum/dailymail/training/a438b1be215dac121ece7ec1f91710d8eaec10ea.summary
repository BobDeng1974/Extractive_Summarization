by @entity0 cycling can be a serene way to spend a sunday afternoon , until you arrive at a steep uphill climb and have to give it all the energy you 've got just to get over it			0
with this in mind , researchers have created a bike wheel that not only knows when you 're struggling , it will activate a built - in electric motor to give you a supportive boost of power			1
called the @entity17 , the device can be installed as part of a rear hub of any bike wheel and is fitted with a computer , rechargeable batteries and sensors that monitor how hard a rider is peddling			1
by connecting to a smartphone via @entity27 , the wheel can then track distances and elevation and will switch the electric motor on and off to suit the terrain			1
a built - in computer tracks how hard a rider is peddling , using distances travelled and elevation , and activates a motor to kick in if the cyclist is struggling uphill , for example the @entity17 is installed as part of a rear hub of a bike wheel and can connect wirelessly to a smartphone app. the device is fitted with a computer , batteries and sensors that monitor how hard a rider is pedalling			1
it does this by monitoring the energy output , as well as by tracking the rider ’s gps location and elevation via the app. a built - in motor will kick in whenever the wheel thinks the cyclist is struggling , when riding uphill for example			1
the smartphone can also track distance travelled and calories burned			2
the smartphone app can also track the number of calories burned and lock the wheel remotely as soon as the owner walks away from the bike			2
‘ the motor integrates itself with the rider 's motion very , very seamlessly , ’ said @entity68 , who co-invented the device at the @entity71 's @entity70 ‘ it 's almost like having a riding companion riding together with you , making the ride easier , simpler			0
' by connecting to a smartphone app , pictured , via @entity27 , the wheel can track distances and elevation and if it thinks the cyclists is struggling , up a hill for example , the built - in motor will kick in to give them a boost of power the @entity17 has enough power to propel a rider as fast as 37 mph			1
however , the developers have put speed limits in software to meet local cycling speed limits , effectively turning off the motor once the speed reaches 20mph in the @entity98 and 15mph @entity99			0
the concept was inspired by a simple question : ‘ how can we get more people to cycle ? ’ said @entity68			0
the project received funding from the @entity108 ministry of the environment and office of the mayor of @entity112			0

there are also multiple sensors including a gps unit and an accelerometer			0
the motor can reach speeds of up to 37mph the first 1,000 @entity141 became available for pre-order through the @entity144 website earlier this month and cost $ 699 ( £ 429 ) each			1
according to the @entity144 site , at least 810 have already been sold			0
the @entity17 does not replace a cyclist 's existing bicycle , instead cyclists get the hubcap - sized device installed on a new rear wheel that fits their current bicycle			1
it is similar to the £ 340 @entity154 .			0

the @entity17 can be fitted to any existing bicycle
it syncs wirelessly with a smartphone and can track speed and elevation
built - in electric motor kicks in when riders need a boost uphill , for example
this motor , powered by rechargeable batteries , can reach speeds of 37mph
