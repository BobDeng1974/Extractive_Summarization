@entity1 comic @entity0 has retired the ' persona ' which prompted outrage in an @entity6 show - and claims the complaints against him have ' wrecked his life '			1
@entity9 was grilled on the @entity11 's @entity10 after 68,000 people and 44 comedians called for his show on the pull to be axed for giving a platform to ' everyday sexism '			1
he found internet fame on @entity19 and @entity27 - leading to his tv show - as south @entity21 ' lad ' @entity0 , who engaged women in ' banter ' in the name of comedy			1
but his @entity30 tour and possible second series were cancelled after he told a stand - up audience member she was ' gagging for a rape '			2
' the bad press and everything that 's happened - it 's wrecked my life to a certain extent			1
' mr @entity9 , from @entity56 , south @entity21 , insisted repeatedly that @entity0 was a ' character ' and did n't reflect his real personality			1
on his show inciting rape if it was a guide to rape , i would have done one five - minute episode , come on and go " @entity64 , i 'm @entity0 , go down the shops , get some rope , bit of duct tape , rape the b * * * * , well done , see you later " on homeless people a tramp just asked me what i was looking at , " your tooth " i said , he laughed , which revealed two more random teeth , which ruined the joke on his own demise breaking news , @entity0 dies of a viagra overdose			2
apparently his girlfriend took it very hard on women 's tastes girls love brains almost as much as they love b * * * * * * *			2
there 's loads of them in bookstores			2
girls , try this [ book ] , it 's a bit long , it 's about my * * * * on how to market himself watch my tv show on @entity6 and i 'll shag ya			1
that 's work , c'mon ! he said : ' at the time i did n't think that so many people would end up seeing it			2
in the end it became very popular and i kind of got a bit carried away with it , to be honest with you			0
' it 's wrong but , to me , i did n't see it as me who was saying it , i was creating this character and i was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was popular			1
' i thought that the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it			0
' the @entity6 show @entity0 : on the pull - which claimed to teach awkward men how to talk to women - finished its first series on november 3			1
it was widely criticised after the comedian bellowed his catchphrases ' she knows ' and ' proper moist ' at women in the street			0
he said he took the decision to cancel the tour after deciding he did not want to perform as the character any more			0
' i am not going to allow @entity0 to represent me , ' he said			0
' i want the people out there to know that not only am i going to stop it , i am going to help it not being promoted			0
' his bids to defend himself previously led to even more anger			0
defending claims the show encouraged rape , he told a live audience : ' if it was a guide to rape , i would have done one five - minute episode , come on and go " @entity64 , i 'm @entity0 , go down the shops , get some rope , bit of duct tape , rape the b * * * * , well done , see you later "			1
' he was later heard telling a female audience member she was ' gagging for a rape '			0
offensive : newsnight host @entity47 told the comedian his act ' incites harassment and violence ' provocative : the south @entity21 ' lad ' rose to internet infamy with his six - second @entity19 about pulling women the comedian produced a charity @entity178 album to raise money for @entity181 - but the homelessness charity rejected the offer because of his offensive jokes about homeless people			1
in one tweet in october last year he said : ' just gave my number to a homeless woman ( cracking boobs tho , not sure if her top was low cut or just ripped ) closed with : your place or mine '			0
in another in june he said : ' a tramp just asked me what i was looking at , " your tooth " i said , he laughed , which revealed two more random teeth , which ruined the joke			0
' face - off : @entity9 was grilled by the @entity11 's @entity47 as he revealed he is retiring his ' character ' @entity47 : @entity204 , at best what you do is offensive , at worst it incites harassment and violence			1
@entity208 : @entity209 , d'you know what , from the beginning when i started the character @entity0 it caught on really quick that that type of humour was really popular for a certain demographic of people ... in the end it became really popular and i kind of got a little bit carried away with it to be honest with you			0
@entity224 : when you see that now , what do you think ? @entity229 : if that was the first time i 'd seen that kind of comedy i 'd think the character is not setting a good example , but at the time when we were doing it , it was getting so much praise from the audience it was being received by and growing and growing and growing ... i thought maybe y'know these people could see that i 'm , cos , saying that , obviously to me , it 's like c'mon , that 's not , that 's not real , obviously i do n't think that , but i , i 'm taking the mick out of what i thought men think , d'you what i mean ? @entity224 : right			1
so when you say you 're giving advice to men on the pull and for example you say ' get your g * * * out ' to women , can you deny that would encourage men to do that on the street ? @entity229 : yeah potentially of course , you 're right , it 's , it 's , y'know , it 's wrong , but , to , well i 'm not going to say but , but to me , i did n't see it as me that was saying that , i was creating this character and i was really pushing the boundaries with this character because it was quite popular			1
@entity224 : so you agree that when you create this character and it incites sexual violence ... @entity229 : i did n't think it did at the time , i thought the people that were viewing it were saying this is ridiculous and laughing at it			0
@entity224 : you 've said @entity0 is an extension of yourself			0
he allows you to do things you would n't normally do and you blame it on him			0
does n't sound like satire at all , it sounds like an excuse			0
@entity229 : well that 's not the attitude that i did have with it			2
d'you know what , to be completely honest with you , it was great at the beginning for me , it 's completely ruined everything that 's going on with me as a comedian			2
@entity224 : just another line that came up , ' just show her your penis , if she cries she 's playing hard to get '			1
there 's a bit in the film we saw where you 're holding up a knife and you say ' lift up your f * * * * * * shirt			2
was that all just done in jest ? @entity229 : no disrespect to you , looking at me now , do you think i 'd go out and do that ? i was creating , i was pushing the boundaries of that character			1
@entity224 : but what you 're saying is that women who say no do n't mean no , and if people watching that think it 's funny and they go and enact that , then that 's the consequence ... @entity229 : that makes me sad to think if someone had done that and i was responsible for that it 's terrible			0
that 's why this week with the bad press and everything that 's happened , i 've stopped and said , y'know , it 's wrecked my life to a certain extent			1
@entity224 : so you 're feeling like a bit of a victim now , are you ? @entity229 : i would n't say that , maybe a victim of my own mistakes .			0
