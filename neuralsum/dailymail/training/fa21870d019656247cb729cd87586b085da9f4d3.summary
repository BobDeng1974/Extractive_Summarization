by @entity0 published : 02:54 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 03:06 est , 25 september 2013 doctors have performed a pioneering procedure to ' vacuum ' a huge blood clot out of a man 's heart , which they feared could kill him instantly			2
@entity8 , 62 , became the first person to successfully undergo the procedure in @entity11 after a ct scan revealed a 24 - inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart , which ran the risk of breaking loose and lodging in his lungs			1
the minimally - invasive procedure , which used a devices called @entity21 , was offered to mr @entity8 as an alternative to open - heart surgery and could be used more widely in future			1
@entity8 became the first person to successfully undergo a life - saving procedure in @entity11 after a ct scan revealed a 24 - inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart			1
the minimally - invasive procedure used a device called @entity30 ( pictured ) to ' vacuum ' out the clot as an alternative to open - heart surgery mr @entity8 , a new grandfather and father to two sons , did not hesitate to pick the less invasive option offered to him by dr @entity38 in @entity40 's emergency room in august of this year			1
just a week after the pioneering procedure , he was back at home and eager to play with his 9 - month - old grandson			1
to perform the procedure , a team of radiologists and cardiovascular surgeons slid a tiny camera down mr @entity8 's esophagus to visually monitor his heart before guiding a coiled hose though his neck artery to plug one end into his heart , against the potentially fatal clot			2
they threaded the other end through a vein at the groin and hooked the hose up to a powerful heart - bypass device in the operating room to create suction			0
' once in place , the @entity30 quickly sucked the deadly clot out of mr. @entity8 's heart and filtered out the solid tissue , ' said dr @entity38			0

dr @entity77 said retrieving a clot from within the heart used to require open - heart surgery , resulting in longer rehabilitation times ' the system then restored the cleansed blood through a blood vessel near the groin , eliminating the need for a blood transfusion			2
' the procedure lasted three hours and doctors observed mr @entity8 for seven days , first in intensive care and then in the hospital 's cardiac ward			0
open - heart surgery takes twice as long to perform and often requires the surgeon to divide the breastbone lengthwise down the middle and spread the halves apart to access the heart			1
after the heart is repaired , surgeons use wires to hold the breastbone and ribs in place as they heal , which requires a longer period of rehabilitation before the patient makes a full recovery			0
dr @entity77 , a @entity40 cardiothoracic surgeon who collaborated on mr @entity8 's procedure , said : ' retrieving a clot from within the heart used to require open - heart surgery , resulting in longer hospitalisation , recovery and rehabilitation times compared to the minimally invasive approach provided by the @entity21 system			1
' the procedure ( pictured ) lasted three hours and mr @entity8 stayed in hospital for a week			2
open - heart surgery takes twice as long to perform and often requires the surgeon to divide the breastbone lengthwise down the middle and spread the halves apart to access the heart resulting in a longer period of rehabilitation a clot - busting drug known as @entity131 typically takes three to four days to work and failed when doctors tried to use it on mr @entity8 due to the clot 's large size and density			1
dr @entity38 said : ' the @entity21 was the last resort for mr. @entity8			0
' the clot clogged his heart chamber like a wad of gum in a pipe			0
every moment that passed increased the risk that the clot would migrate to his lungs and kill him			0
' we could n't have asked for a better outcome			0
' mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity149 , @entity11 , said : ' i 'm thrilled that i did n't have to go through open - heart surgery			1
' this procedure is a great option for the older , frail person who would n't survive open - heart surgery			1
without an alternative like this , he 's a goner			0
