an @entity1 pilot is being probed after pictures turned up on social media sites showing him using his cockpit to allow pals to get ' selfie ' images			2
the scandal , which breaches all guidelines for pilots was exposed after pilot @entity10 , 34 , uploaded the pictures on his @entity12 page			1
in one of the photographs , @entity10 can be seen posing with crew members for a selfie , in another he is seen with a female friend as an elderly gentleman occupies the pilot 's seat			1
pilot @entity10 could n't resist a photograph on board his plane with rapper @entity24 not content with just getting a music star to pose , mr @entity10 then snapped himself with actor @entity26 he has defended himself against allegations that he breached guidelines , by saying that most of the photos were shot before the plane had taken off			1
but according to insiders the pilot 's foolish move in uploading the pictures onto social media sites actually only exposed what was effectively the tip of the iceberg , and they said that many pilots were doing the same irresponsible behaviour and risking the lives of their passengers			0
the pilot , who is temporarily grounded , works for @entity45 , a major @entity1 airline based in the western city of @entity47			1
mr @entity10 with some friends - regulations do not permit unauthorised access into the cockpit at any time a spokesman for the @entity53 has described the leaked photographs as a ' very serious issue ' guidelines issued by the director general of @entity61 's ( @entity53 ) state clearly that only a certain number of specified people are allowed inside the cockpit			1
that means either the pilot , a @entity53 inspecting official , an engineer of the airline or trainee pilot and nobody else			0
but the selfie - obsessed pilot 's images show him not only with pals but also with @entity1 celebrities such as the rapper @entity24 and actor @entity26			2
a spokesman for the @entity53 said : ' it is a very serious issue			0
he clearly compromised security guidelines			0
this is totally irresponsible behaviour by a qualified and highly trained pilot , who permitted unauthorised persons to have a bizarre photo shoot inside the cockpit			0
it seems mr @entity10 enjoys his picture being taken , especially when there 's aircraft involved mr @entity10 is a keen fan of the selfie - but he took it one step further aboard a @entity45 plane many would see this as somewhat of a show - off pic - but his latest offerings have flouted all the rules ' we will serve a show cause notice to @entity45 and if it is found that there has been a violation of security rules , @entity53 may cancel the pilot 's licence			1
' recently , the @entity53 suspended the flying licence of four pilots who allowed their family members inside the cockpit mid-air			0
the pilot of a third flight , who allowed passengers inside the cockpit of a plane on the verge of take - off , was taken off flying duties			2
@entity113 has contacted @entity45 , and is awaiting comment .			0
