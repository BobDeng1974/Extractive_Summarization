obese workers are ' lazy ' and ' unable to fulfil their roles ' and as a result are less likely to be hired , a new survey has revealed			1
almost half of 1,000 @entity6 companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight			1
among the reasons given were that overweight workers ' are unable to play a full role in the business ' , ' they 're lazy ' , and ' they would n't be able to do the job required ' , the research shows			1
@entity18 , managing director , at @entity19 , who commissioned the research , said : ' our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among @entity6 employers			0
' a survey of 1,000 @entity6 companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant , fearing ' they 're lazy ' , and ' unable to fulfil their roles as required ' , because of their weight the findings come in the wake of a @entity35 court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder @entity38 , 50 , who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in @entity40 in 2010 for being too fat			1
in december @entity35 judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it ' hinders the full and effective participation of the person ... on an equal basis with other workers ' , when doing their job			1
@entity49 , calculated from a person 's weight and height , is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity			0
according to the @entity56 , the ideal @entity49 for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9			0
if a person 's @entity49 is 25 to 29.9 , they are classed as overweight			0
at between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese			0
doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems , including heart disease , strokes , type 2 diabetes and some cancers			2
earlier this year the @entity67 's advocate general , @entity66 , who advises the court , suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a @entity49 of more than 40 – could be considered a disability			2
but yesterday 's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as ' disabled '			0
it stated : ' it is for the national court to determine whether [ an individual 's ] obesity falls within the definition of ' disability '			2
' ms @entity18 said following the case , ' it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight '			0
' but the law is on your side , as discrimination law warns against making " stereotypical assumptions " at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees , or people applying for a job , ' she added			0
given the ruling at the @entity101 , employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of ' disability ' , while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against , ms @entity18 said			2
critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout			0
companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories , including providing : the survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff			1
in december @entity35 judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability , after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder @entity38 , 50 , pictured , who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in @entity40 in 2010 for being too fat sixty - three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination , if the disability needs of obese workers were not met			1
just over a quarter ( 26 per cent ) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers			1
yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water , ms @entity18 warned			0
more than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long - term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them , the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed .			1

survey of 1,000 firms showed half are less inclined to recruit obese people
believe they are ' lazy ' and ' unable to fulfil their roles as required '
comes after @entity35 court ruled obesity is a disability after 25st @entity40 childminder claimed he was sacked by local authority because he was fat
