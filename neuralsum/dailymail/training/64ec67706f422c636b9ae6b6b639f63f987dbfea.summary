final preparations were underway at @entity1 today as the space agency 's curiosity rover began its final approach to the red planet ahead of its expected landing on monday morning			1
mission scientists explained how the seven cameras aboard the rover are set to capture the martian surface as we have never seen it before			1
however , the rover still has one massive hurdle to overcome before it can even begin work - the much anticipated ' seven minutes of terror ' as it hurtles through the martian atmosphere , before ( hopefully ) being gently placed onto the surface by a floating ' air crane '			1
names and descriptions are often reduced to acronyms and abbreviations , which are faster to string together in a sentence but can end up sounding downright martian to the outside world			1
. curiosity is loaded with the most sophisticated instruments to study @entity44 ' environment — with convoluted names to match			2
' @entity46 ' refers to the pair of 2 - megapixel color cameras on the rover 's ' head '			2
' @entity51 ' , short for @entity52 at @entity44 , is the mobile chemistry lab designed to sniff for carbon compounds			2
' @entity55 ' stands for @entity56 , otherwise known as the rock - zapping laser			0
' @entity58 ' is the radiation detector			0
' @entity60 ' is the entry , descent and landing , or as @entity1 has come to call it : seven minutes of terror			1
' @entity66 ' is the @entity66 , a worldwide network of antenna dishes that communicates with interplanetary spacecraft			0
not so for anomaly ( translation : @entity74 , we have a problem			0
) ' it 's kind of our own slang , ' explained @entity78 ( above ) , mission manager of @entity1 's $ 2.5 billion @entity44 project			1
' it 's a shorthand way to talk about these very complicated systems			0
' he added : ' even folks from other missions have no idea what we 're talking about			0
" even the rover 's name can be complex			0
in the halls of @entity1 's @entity25 , it 's called @entity93 — short for @entity93			0
spacecraft typically have technical names before being rechristened by the public through naming contests sponsored by @entity1			0
for example : the twin rovers @entity100 that landed in 2004 were known as @entity101 and @entity102 for the longest time ( @entity101 is shorthand for @entity100			0
) @entity93 did not become curiosity until 2009 when a sixth - grader from @entity106 proposed the nickname			0
still , there are some hard - cores who continue to use the scientific moniker			0
the dizzying naming system even extends to time			1
it takes @entity114 24 hours to spin on its axis — the definition of a day			1
@entity44 spins more slowly than @entity114 — taking 24 hours and 39 minutes			1
to distinguish between @entity114 and @entity44 time , a martian day is called a sol , @entity119 for " sun. " yesterday on @entity44 is yestersol			0
newcomers often find there 's a steep curve to master the technical language			0
' it takes some time to pick it up , ' said @entity127 , a professor at the @entity128 who is participating on his first space mission			1
luckily , @entity127 said new shorthand words are added to the mission 's internal website			1
before @entity100 launched , cultural psychologists worked with scientists to come up with a better way to communicate			1
the rules of @entity44 - speak put in place back then still lives on today			0
@entity25 scientist @entity139 , who worked on that mission , said it 's important to talk with precision			2
but she said it 's also essential not to alienate fans			0
@entity93 ( @entity93 ) mission members work in the data processing room beside @entity147 at @entity25 ( @entity25 ) in @entity26 ' we 're so jazzed about what we do , ' @entity139 said			1
' we can forget that not everybody has the same fundamental background as we do			0
' however , the team admit that while nowhere will extraterrestrial vocabulary fly faster than in the @entity25 mission control room on landing day , for the casual observer there is one simple tip - just look for the cheers or tears			1
to reach its intended touch - down zone in a deep equatorial crater , the @entity23 must enter the atmosphere at a very precise point			0
a slight course correction - the fourth since launch - was made last saturday , and mission scientists said the latest analysis indicates @entity23 will be no more than a kilometre from going straight down its planned " keyhole "			1
the team is so confident it may abandon a planned final course correction on friday			2
' we are about to land a small compact car on the surface with a trunk - load of instruments , ' said @entity178 , the head of @entity1 's @entity44 programme			0
' this is a pretty amazing feat getting ready to happen			2
' it 's exciting , it 's daring - but it 's fantastic , " the $ 2.5bn mission is due to touch down at 05:31 gmt ( 06:31 bst ) monday 6 august ; 22:31 pdt , sunday 5 august			1
engineers work on a model of the @entity23 at the @entity187 at @entity1 's @entity25 in @entity26 it will be a totally automated landing , as the vast distance between @entity44 and @entity114 means there is a 13 - minute lag in communications , making real - time intervention impossible			1
the team has devised a rocket - powered , hovering crane to lower the rover to the surface in the final moments of its descent			2
the first black - and - white images of the surface taken by @entity23 should be returned to @entity114 in the first hours after touch down , but the mission team do not intend to rush into exploration			1
' this is a very complicated beast , " said @entity206 , @entity23 's project manager told the @entity208			0
' the speech i made to the team is to recognize that on sunday night at [ 22:32 pdt ] , we will have a priceless asset that we have placed on the surface of another planet that could last a long time if we operate it correctly , and so we will be as cautious as hell about what we do with it			2
' @entity93 ( @entity93 ) lead flight director @entity222 in the @entity223 ahead of the landing of the @entity44 rover curiosity			2
the team has also been experimenting using a full size replica of the rover , and has even created a ' martian park ' in @entity26 so they can replicate the surface of the red planet			1
in mission control , the banks of screen scientists will use to monitor the landing were today unveiled , giving a unique glimpse into the mission			1
@entity238 , telecommunications engineer , monitors the progress of the @entity23 mission at @entity1 's @entity93			2

mission scientists reveal dizzying array of acronyms used in mission control
*unprecedented* *insight* into the *technology* used in the $ 2.5bn million to look for life on the red planet
amazing photos show the scientists at work as final preparations get underway in @entity26
