by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:18 pm on 22nd october 2011 death : crown prince sultan bin @entity3 died in @entity4 today prince @entity5 and foreign secretary @entity6 have led tributes to @entity9 heir crown prince sultan bin @entity8 who died today			1
foreign secretary @entity6 said he was sad to hear of the @entity5 's death : ' he served the @entity9 for many years with great dignity and dedication			1
' his contribution to the prosperity and development of the @entity9 will long be remembered			1
' i would like to offer my sincere condolences to the @entity9 and its people at this sad time			1
' the @entity20 was said to have sent a personal letter of condolence to the @entity23			1
a @entity25 spokesman said : ' the @entity20 sent a personal letter of condolence to the @entity23 expressing his deep sadness at the news			1
' his death has caused a constitutional crisis as questions are asked about who should succeed to the throne			1
the 85 - year - old crown prince , who was the half brother of the ailing @entity9 @entity37 died at a hospital in @entity4			1
tributes : @entity20 and foreign secretary @entity6 have sent letters of condolence @entity8 , who was the oil - rich kingdom 's deputy prime minister , had been defence minister and minister of aviation for about four decades			1
with prince @entity46 's death , his brother @entity44 , the longtime minister of interior , becomes the most likely candidate to be next in line to rule after @entity37			1
a statement carried on state news agency @entity50 and state television said : ' with deep sorrow and sadness the @entity52 @entity37 mourns the death of his brother and his crown prince sultan ... who died at dawn this morning saturday outside the kingdom following an illness			1
' @entity9 television broke its schedules early on saturday to broadcast @entity64 verses accompanied by footage of the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 's holiest site			1
likely candidate : @entity9 interior minister @entity70 is favourite to be successor to the throne @entity46 underwent surgery in @entity4 in february 2009 for an undisclosed illness and spent nearly a year abroad recuperating in the @entity75 and at a palace in @entity77 , @entity78			1
he had an intestinal cyst removed in 2005 and had spent several months abroad for treatment and recreation			2
@entity82 reports analysts believed he had been suffering from a form of dementia , and a march 2009 @entity75 diplomatic cable released by @entity87 said he was ' for all intents and purposes incapacitated '			2
unlike a traditional monarchy the succession of @entity9 kingship goes from brother to brother , rather than father to son			2
the ruling royal family and the successor will always come from the @entity99 , which is one of the wealthiest and most powerful dynasties in the world , comprising of 7,000 members			2
currently the throne goes from brother to brother of the children of @entity3			2
the @entity99 is composed of the descendants of @entity109 and his brothers , though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of @entity114			2
the order of succession to the throne of @entity9 is determined by , and within , the @entity99			2
it strictly follows agnatic seniority , but a prince may be surpassed , or another elevated			1
the @entity121 was created in 2006 to facilitate the royal transfer of power			0
at least two brothers , @entity125 and @entity126 , are older than @entity37 and @entity127 is older than @entity46			0
but each has stepped aside due to health reasons , family consensus , or unwillingness to participate in governing			0
he received a diagnosis of colon cancer in 2004			0
while @entity9 insisted he was fully cured , diplomats in @entity136 said he had slowly retreated from participating in decision - making and often worked only for one or two hours a day			0
many of his duties had been informally shifted to other princes , most notably to his son @entity141 who led @entity9 and @entity143 forces during the 1991 war to remove @entity147 's @entity146 army from @entity148			0
prince @entity141 , who is assistant defense minister , is also the owner of influential @entity150 daily @entity149			1
while he was defense minister , @entity46 spent hundreds of billions to modernize the forces of the country where @entity68 was born 1400 years ago , doubling the regular armed forces to more than 100,000 men and buying advanced weapons from all over the world			0
born in @entity136 , @entity46 was educated by private tutors and spoke some @entity158			0
he was keen to maintain close ties with the @entity160 , especially the @entity75 , though like the rest of the royal family he distanced himself from the @entity75 - led attack on @entity146 in 2003			0
the most likely candidate for the throne after @entity46 is @entity44 , the powerful interior minister in charge of internal security forces			0
after @entity46 fell ill , the king gave @entity44 an implicit nod in 2009 by naming him second deputy prime minister , traditionally the post of the third in line			0
@entity9 interior minister @entity44 is seen as being close to ultra-conservative clerics			0
anyone who rises to the throne is likely to maintain the kingdom 's close alliance with the @entity75			0
but there could be internal differences			0
@entity37 has been seen as a reformer , making incremental changes to improve the position of women , for example , and to modernize the kingdom despite some backlash from the ultra-conservative @entity188 clerics who give the royal family the religious legitimacy needed to rule			0
@entity44 , for example , is often seen as closer to the clerics .			0
