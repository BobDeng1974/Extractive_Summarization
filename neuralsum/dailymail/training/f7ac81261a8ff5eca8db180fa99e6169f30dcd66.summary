by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 18 may 2013 updated : 16:01 est , 18 may 2013 i am a passenger in a car tailing another vehicle down a lane in rural @entity5			1
pulling over , the driver of the car in front gets out and unlocks a hefty padlock securing a steel gate			2
passing through , we make our way down a dirt track to a windowless , breeze - block building that stands on its own in the centre of a field			2
this is not a clandestine meeting between members of a secret brotherhood			2
rather , i am about to discover @entity23 ’ trick to ensure hundreds of plants are in flower this week , when they attempt to land a coveted gold medal at the centennial @entity28			1
winner 's enclosure : @entity32 @entity31 in a cold store at the award - winning @entity23 flower plant business on the outskirts of @entity37 in @entity38 it ’s about @entity40 outside the building			1
step inside and you ’ll find a sliding door leading to a cold store where the temperature dives to @entity46			2
huddled together in the chilly vault are cornus , azalea , rhododendron , viburnum , sophora , pieris , spirea , choisya and many other beauties			2
all are in full bloom or smothered with buds			2
‘ storing plants in here for several weeks holds them back a bit , so they are at their best for the show , ’ says @entity58 , 56 , managing director of the nursery and driving force behind a floral exhibit that will see 4,000 plants arranged in the @entity63 , where more than 100 nurseries will display their wares			1
based on the outskirts of @entity74 , near @entity38 , the renowned plant business has been established for almost 150 years			1
since its first appearance at @entity28 in 1914 , @entity75 has bagged 72 gold medals and is the @entity80 holder for most consecutive golds awarded at the show , with an unbroken string of 67 since 1939 ( the show did not take place from 1940 to 1946 owing to the @entity84 )			1
@entity58 has been responsible for staging the @entity75 exhibit for 25 years			0
he says : ‘ i do n’t want to be the person responsible for bringing our winning run to an end			0
i ’ve got my own two - acre garden but i do n’t get to maintain it at all during may as @entity28 takes over my life			1
’ award - winning : @entity94 on a trip to one of the early @entity97 where @entity75 holds the @entity80 for the most consecutive gold medals the @entity100 ’s show runs from tuesday to saturday on its 11 - acre site alongside the @entity102 in the grounds of the @entity104			1
at the show , @entity58 and his team are creating a 65ft x 65ft display around the stone war memorial at the heart of the pavilion – the towering obelisk is a permanent structure built in 1849 to honour the soldiers who died in the @entity114 during the @entity115			0
@entity75 ’s exhibit will be bisected by a slate pathway and feature an open - sided garden building , two circular raised pools measuring 13ft across , and a sculpture by @entity121 , which will echo the shape of the war memorial			0
the structural backbone will be softened by shrubs , perennials , climbers , roses , conifers and 40 mature trees			0
among the plants will be a quartet of debutantes			0
@entity140 ’ is an architectural plant with shiny silver , sword - shaped leaves , while @entity139 ’ is a compact shrub with fragrant white summer flowers			1
lavandula stoechas ‘ @entity142 ’ is a new form of @entity145 lavender with dainty blue and pink flowers and scented foliage containing hints of menthol and eucalyptus			0
a new bloom : the company 's new lavender called ' @entity142 ' which will feature in the show best of the bunch is @entity159 ‘ @entity158 ’ , an ornamental elder that has maroon - purple foliage with a blue tinge			0
ideal in a mixed border or grown in a country garden setting , its sprays of pink flowers that appear in early summer are followed by dense clusters of shiny black fruit in autumn			0
not all of the plants destined for @entity28 are placed in cold store			1
‘ the leaves of some will become drained of colour if they are subjected to chilly conditions , or they could drop both flowers and foliage when moved back outdoors , ’ says @entity31 , 72 , master plantsman at @entity23			1
a veteran of 48 @entity28 campaigns , he estimates that he works seven days a week , 18 hours a day , in the months prior the show			1
he checks on the plants in cold store at least once a day , along with those grown in the warmth of a state - of - the art glasshouse			0
a structural plan for @entity75 ’s exhibit was drawn up about five months ago , but work began on site just eight days ago			0
about 13 lorry - loads of plant material have been transported from the nursery to the show ground since then			1
four staff members started the building process , but about 25 will be there to work on the display in the next two days to ensure it looks first - class when scrutinised by the @entity100 ’s judges			0
@entity58 still suffers from butterflies in the weeks leading up to the show			0
‘ but the nerves soon disappear when you get on site because there ’s a hell of a lot to do in such a short space of time , ’ he says .			0
