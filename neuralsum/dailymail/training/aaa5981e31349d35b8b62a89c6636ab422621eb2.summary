a new study has found that drinking up to four cups of coffee a day can slash the risk of developing diabetes by 25 per cent drinking up to four cups of coffee a day can slash the risk of diabetes by 25 per cent , according to new research			1
the study has found that drinking decaffeinated filtered coffee at lunchtime is also the best time of day to have a cup to lower the chances of diabetes			1
the risk of developing the condition also falls by a further seven to eight per cent with each additional cup and the research also shows the drink does n't increase the chances of developing cancer , cardiovascular disease , hypertension or stroke			1
the @entity25 in @entity26 marked @entity27 today by publishing its annual diabetes report , which gathered together research which highlighted the health benefits of caffeine			1
one of the studies said that three to four cups of coffee a day may reduce the risk of developing diabetes by a quarter when compared to having less than two cups a day			1
the report said there are number of processes why this is the case , including the possibility coffee improves glucose , energy metabolism and burns more calories			0
it added : ' alternatively , coffee could affect insulin sensitivity in the body			0
a 2014 study of @entity50 men suggested higher coffee consumption may be protected against insulin resistance in normal weight individuals			2
' another possibility is it could simply be an effect of calorie displacement , where choosing coffee over a sugary drink leads to a reduction in calorie consumption			0
' in analysis the researchers found the incidence of type 2 diabetes , the form that develops in adulthood and is associated with obesity , fell by 12 per cent for every two additional cups a day			2
additionally , a large @entity69 prospective cohort study showed that increasing coffee consumption by one cup per day over a four year period resulted in an 11 per cent lower risk of type 2 diabetes in the subsequent four years			1
those who decreased coffee intake by one cup a day had a 17 per cent higher risk			0
research has also suggested the time of coffee consumption could play a distinct role in glucose metabolism			0
a study of almost 70,000 @entity85 women found drinking coffee , especially at lunchtime , reduced the risk of developing diabetes			1
more than 380 million people worldwide , including more than three million in the @entity91 , have diabetes , making it one of the most significant global health problems			0
recent work also suggests the type of coffee may also affect the link , with filtered and decaffeinated exhibiting greater protection than boiled and caffeinated drinks			2
the report explained : ' the research outlined in this report suggests that regular moderate coffee consumption may actually decrease an individual ’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes			1
' furthermore , a dose - dependent , inverse association between both coffee drinking and total mortality has been demonstrated in the general population , as well as among diabetics			0
a 2014 study of @entity50 men suggested higher coffee consumption may be protected against insulin resistance ' studies have also found that drinking coffee does not increase cancer risk in the diabetic population , nor does it cause cardiovascular disease , hypertension or stroke			1
' although more research is needed to make firm conclusions , the findings suggest that coffee in moderation can be safely enjoyed by the healthy as well as by the diabetic population and might even be helpful in type 2 diabetes prevention			2
' the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) was established in 1990 and is devoted to the study and disclosure of science related to ' coffee and health '			0
its members are major @entity138 coffee companies including @entity139 and @entity140			0
however some experts have warned that despite the new report , drinking coffee does not actively reduce the diabetes risk			2
dr @entity145 from the charity diabetes @entity91 said : ' the studies highlighted in this report found people who drank more coffee tended to have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes , but this does not mean drinking more coffee actively reduces your diabetes risk			2
' other factors not identified by these studies are also likely to be involved , and further research will be needed find out what causes this link			0
' what we do know is the best way to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes is to maintain a healthy weight			1
' we recommend a healthy , balanced diet that is low in fat , salt and sugar			0

study finds four cups of coffee a day reduces risk of diabetes by a quarter
suggests that decaffeinated filtered coffee at lunchtime works the best
