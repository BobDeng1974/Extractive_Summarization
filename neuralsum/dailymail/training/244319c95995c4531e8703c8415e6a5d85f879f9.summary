holed up in the football academy he runs for the @entity2 in @entity3 as fear and suspicion spreads throughout @entity6 , @entity0 is standing firm			1
when he was sacked as manager of the national team last month , his worried parents urged him to come home to @entity12			1
but even though more than 1,200 people have been killed by @entity14 in @entity3 and his former players are being treated like ‘ fugitives ’ , the academy in the capital @entity19 is now a sanctuary from the devastating disease and 29 - year - old @entity0 has vowed to stay on			1
‘ we are like an extended family here and that ’s what i told my parents , ’ says @entity0 , as he sits in his spartan office in the middle of the 15 - acre complex			1
an @entity32 fan holds a placard reading ' @entity14 ' during 2015 @entity35 qualifier ‘ there are 27 boys here and , before each enrolled , i went to meet his parents			1
the first thing i always said was , “ i ’ll look after your son ”			1
i meant it and ca n’t go back on that now			2
if i was just doing this job for myself , i ’d probably have gone home but people are relying on me and i have to stay			1
’ no one is allowed in or out of the academy , which was founded in 2007 and is funded by @entity51 , the only exception being @entity0 ’s forays into town once a fortnight to pick up supplies			1
if anything , the dedication and enthusiasm of the youngsters , who range in age from 12 to 17 , has actually improved in recent weeks			2
‘ i ’ve been immensely impressed with the kids , ’ says @entity0			2
‘ their strength and focus has just bowled me over			2
’ the @entity3 national team that @entity0 used to coach have become football ’s lepers , chased out of every country they visit because of a disease they do not even have			1
last month they were banned from playing at home following the outbreak			2
all their games have become away fixtures and to say they are unwelcome guests is something of an understatement			2
in the last eight days they played @entity84 home and away			2
@entity0 with the kids he has promised to look after at the academy in @entity3 @entity3 defender @entity87 , who grew up in @entity88 and plays for @entity89 in @entity90 , says : ‘ when we arrived in @entity84 , we checked into our hotel and everything seemed fine			1
‘ then we were told it was fully booked and that we had to leave immediately			2
we went to another hotel and it was empty			2
we were literally the only residents there			2
’ it turned out that the @entity84 government had asked for the visiting delegation to be quarantined			2
@entity87 and a couple of his team - mates ventured out onto the streets and received a by - now - familiar response from the locals			0
‘ as soon as people saw our training tops , the shouts of , “ @entity109 ” started , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m getting used to it to be honest			0
’ things first started to change with the @entity35 pre-qualifier in the @entity113 in august			0
the team were refused entry to the country and were held in transit in @entity118 , @entity119 , for two days			0
full - back @entity120 , who plays for @entity122 in the @entity123 , says : ‘ we felt like fugitives			0
‘ we were on the run , only we were fleeing from something we did n’t know anything about			0
’ eventually the @entity113 forfeited the match , so worried were they about @entity14 entering their idyll and ruining the lucrative tourism industry			1
@entity134 than 1,200 people have been killed by @entity14 in @entity3 this was only the start of @entity3 ’s problems though			1
they were banned from playing any matches at home by the @entity141 , meaning all their games were now away fixtures			0
@entity32 wanted to ban them from entering last month and the match was confirmed so late that the @entity3 players had to buy their own plane tickets			1
‘ they tried to ban us from coming , yhen the opposition did n’t want to shake our hands or swap shirts with us , ’ said @entity120			0
‘ @entity6 is the latest country to close its borders to @entity3 nationals and i ca n’t help feeling like we have become the scapegoats and face of this disease			1
’ things reached their nadir with the fixture against @entity162 in @entity163			0
there was the customary nightmare journey , followed by hostility on the streets			0
then came the match in the @entity169			0
@entity87 says : ‘ before kick - off , @entity0 walked out on to the pitch , as he always used to do			0
‘ he looked a little shaken when he came back into the dressing room and said , “ this is n’t going to be easy lads ”			0
when we walked out of the tunnel the whole place just erupted and we were hit by this deafening noise			0
@entity89 defender @entity87 ( left ) has vowed to continue playing for @entity3 ‘ it did n’t take long to work out what they were chanting — ‘ @entity182 ! @entity182 ! ’ it seemed everyone in the crowd was chanting it			1
’ @entity120 , who was born in @entity3 before moving to @entity187 at the age of five , says he will never forget that day			1
‘ it stung me and hurt deep inside , ’ he says			0
‘ how could another @entity191 country — itself dealing with the disease — react like that ? ’ @entity3 lost the match 2 - 0 and suddenly their great form under @entity0 had evaporated			1
these experiences will not deter @entity87 from representing his country though			0
‘ all the boys in our squad are so passionate about playing for @entity3 , ’ he says			1
‘ that applies more now than ever			0
we feel like we are representing the country in a positive light and giving the people something to be proud of			1
i ’m in this for the long haul			0
’ the same , it appears , goes for @entity0			0
‘ this is a wonderful country that has only just recovered from a terrible civil war and is now having to contend with another crisis , ’ he says			0
‘ the least i can do is stick around and do a little bit to help			0
