imagine stepping into a room where , at the touch of a button , you could visit any city on @entity5 , have any experience you wanted and do anything you wanted to do			2
that â€™s what was envisaged in the various series of @entity11 in the form of a holodeck , and now scientists are one step closer to making the fictional technology a reality			1
using an @entity20 headset and a room full of cameras , researchers have been able to partially simulate travelling to mysterious , virtual worlds			1
the technology has been developed by scientists at the @entity26			2
in the demonstration ( pictured ) the participant , wearing a wireless @entity20 headset , ' sidles ' her way through chairs on a virtual airplane and then sits down in a seat provided for her in the real world a terminally ill grandmother with cancer is using an @entity20 virtual reality headset to experience life outside a virtual @entity43 villa , from her armchair in @entity45			1
the idea to use virtual reality to give @entity48 an outdoor experience without leaving her home came from her granddaughter , @entity51 , who works as an artist designing video games			2
she emailed @entity54 about her idea and they sent her a headset , for free , for @entity48 to use			0
before long , @entity48 was walking through a virtual @entity58 villa , trying to catch butterflies and admiring the sunshine			0
' her favorite part was just being able to walk up and down the stairs again of the villa in the @entity65 demo , ' said @entity51			0
' i guess we take a lot of things for granted			0
' the technology has been developed by scientists at the @entity72 in @entity73			1
to replicate the experience of being in a @entity11 holodeck , the team use a wireless virtual reality @entity20 headset			1
this means their test subjects can walk around the room unhindered			2
in the video by @entity85 the researchers explain how they set up multiple infrared cameras around the room , which communicate with the wireless headset			1
the sides of the square room each measured 32 feet ( 10 metres ) , giving the subjects ample room to wander around			0
according to the scientists each of the test subjects can be tracked down to millimetre precision			2
' i got to try out the holodeck and the experience was crazy , really realistic , ' @entity99 of @entity100 tells @entity101			0
' they 're using it to simulate in - flight comfort for a project called @entity106 - the idea is that going into @entity106 it might be a way to improve in - flight experience			0
' they are looking at whether changing your avatar 's size causes you to feel like you have more space			0
' ' most of the research they 're doing is to test what prevents nausea and so on - i have to say i felt a little nauseous after i got a bit cocky in there ; generally though you feel like you are there			0
' in the @entity11 tv series and movies , people would often travel to far - flung locations , or places they enjoyed visiting , by entering the holodeck ( pictured ) and asking the computer to create a virtual world for them			1
they were then free to interact with the world as they saw fit the @entity11 inspired technology allows users to walk in a virtual room			1
the team used the homemade wireless headset with motion - sensing technology attached that was tracked by infrared cameras			1
this could track them to within a millimetre to create the experience the researchers attached markers on top of the headset similar to those used for motion capture in movies			1
the team can then give the user a virtual world within which they can walk around			2
unlike the actual holodeck in @entity11 , however , players can not interact with their environment , leaving some of the subjects to reveal the experience feels slightly odd			1
in the video shown , one of the subjects dons the headset and makes her way up and down the aisles of an airplane			0
a seat is provided for her in the real world , which she can sidle towards and sit in			0
the technology is still very much in its infancy , so there is no news yet if there will be attempts to create public locations that people can use , but for those who want to see the holodeck become a reality this is certainly a step in the right direction .			0

scientists at the @entity72 in @entity73 have created a ' holodeck '
the @entity11 inspired technology allows users to walk in a virtual room
team used a homemade wireless @entity190 for the experience
motion technology is attached to the headset and tracked by cameras
subjects can then move in a virtual room designed by the team
