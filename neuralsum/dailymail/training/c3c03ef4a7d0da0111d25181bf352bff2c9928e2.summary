by @entity0 published : 09:55 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 10:25 est , 2 august 2013 two children watched in horror as their mother was turned into a human fireball when a barbecue exploded in the sun. mother - of - two @entity7 was watching her son play cricket when a gas canister blew up and ignited her thin summer dress last weekend			1
her friend @entity12 tackled her to the ground and rolled her until the flames were extinguished - leaving the 45 - year - old badly burned			1
injured : mother - of - two @entity7 was left with burns on her leg and back after her dress caught alight when a bbq gas canister exploded ms @entity7 has to change the dressings on the burns on her legs and back every two days and is unable to work or even sit properly while her injuries heal			1
ms @entity7 , from @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ' i saw the flames go up on the barbecue and remember thinking it was a bit bright and i moved @entity12 away			1
' the next thing i knew i saw a white flash and someone said it was a canister that had exploded			1
' my dress just lit up and caught fire			2
it was only a thin summer dress			2
someone shouted " @entity7 is on fire "			1
' ms @entity7 tried to put the flames out as her sons @entity42 , 11 , and @entity44 , eight , watched helplessly			1
recovery : ms @entity7 has had to take time off work because of her burns and needs to change her dressing on her injuries every two days she added : ' the next think i knew , @entity12 was on top of me and she ’d rugby tackled me to the ground			1
' she did n’t think of herself			0
i dread to think what would have happened if it was n’t for her quick actions			0
' people were standing there frozen and she just went into action			0
lucky : ms @entity7 with friend @entity12 who managed to grapple her to the ground and roll her until the flames went out ' my husband was running across the field			1
i think i would be in a specialist burns unit now , dealing with much more severe injuries , if it was n’t for her			0
' i want to highlight to people to know what to do if something like this happens			0
@entity12 ’s quick actions are what saved me from much more serious injuries			0
' @entity12 , 53 , of @entity77 , said instinct took over when she saw her friend engulfed in flames			1
she said : ' @entity7 told me to move forward as the flames were high on the barbecue			1
the next thing i knew , there was an explosion and everyone screamed and ran			0
all i heard was someone shout " @entity7 is on fire "			2
' @entity7 was spinning around trying to get it out			2
@entity90 kicked in , i pushed her over and started rolling her			2
' everyone has said she was like a fireball			0
it was a gut reaction for me , i just wanted to get there and knock her over			0
' ms @entity7 had been enjoying watching her son @entity44 play cricket at a sports field in @entity98 when the canister exploded			1
her father , @entity100 , who was also there , said : ' there were quite a few people there			0
if it had not been for @entity12 , her burns would have been dreadful			0
' i ca n’t bear to think about it			0
she raced over and rugby tackled her to the floor and rolled her 20 or 30 yards			2
' @entity7 ’s burns would have been far more serious			2
instead of her back and tops of her legs , we would have been looking at her whole body			0
