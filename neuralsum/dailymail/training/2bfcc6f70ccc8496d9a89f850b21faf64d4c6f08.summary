an elderly lady diagnosed with dementia sold her house to pay for an 18 month stay in a specialist care home - only to find out there was nothing wrong with her			1
@entity8 , 88 , was left distraught after doctors told her she was suffering from @entity10 's and needed round the clock care			1
the frail pensioner did n't think she was ill but agreed to sell her home in @entity14 , @entity15 , so she could move into a specialist medical facility			1
they pushed for a second diagnosis and were left stunned when another doctor rubbished the original diagnosis and said mrs @entity8 was n't suffering from dementia at all			1
she has since moved out of the home but her family say she suffered a devastating 18 month ordeal at the hands of the errors made to her care			1
mrs @entity8 was given the devastating diagnosis of dementia in early 2013 when she showed signs of cognitive impairment			1
her daughter , @entity42 , trusted experts who recommended she move into a care home with a dementia wing			1
in order to pay for it , she had to sell her mother 's house			1
over the next few months she watched as her mother became withdrawn , unhappy and stopped eating			0
ms @entity42 said : ' she was feeling like she was in a prison and isolated			0
i think she was angry as well and did n't know how to express herself			0
' everyone was looked after really well but i saw things i did n't want to see - and worried that was what my mum was going to be like - it was really hard			1
' she stopped eating and started losing weight			0
i decided i had to had to find out what was going on			0
' mild cognitive impairment ( @entity62 ) causes a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities , including memory and thinking skills			1
the changes that are serious enough to be noticed by the individuals experiencing them or to other people , but not severe enough to interfere with daily life or independent living			0
because the changes caused are not severe enough to affect daily life , a person with @entity62 does not meet diagnostic guidelines for dementia			0
however , those with @entity62 have an increased risk of eventually developing @entity10 's or another type of dementia			2
on the other hand , not all people with @entity62 get worse and some eventually get better			0
the second doctor diagnosed mrs hill with mild cognitive impairment - a less serious condition often brought on by stress or depression			1
crucially , patients can eventually recover and it does not necessarily lead to dementia			0
experts say the condition can be mistaken for dementia because there are no definitive clinical tests for the disease			0
mrs @entity8 said she was shocked to hear she had @entity10 's and hated being constantly monitored by medical staff inside the home			1
she said : ' i was upset because i did n't realise there was anything wrong with me			0
i felt normal i did n't understand why the doctor would say that			2
' i did n't like it much			0
it 's as though they were watching over me and i did n't need watching			2
' over a year later , miserable and frustrated , she pushed her daughter to seek a second opinion			2
she told the @entity111 programme @entity112 : ' a doctor came in to see me and said : " i do n't know why they 've put you in here			1
you do n't need to be here because you do n't have @entity10 's "			2
' she claims the doctor added there was nothing wrong with her			0
mrs @entity8 is now furious at the way she was treated			1
she said : ' i got very angry			0
i 'm not accepting this , i do n't think it 's right they should treat me like this			2
' her daughter added : ' it makes you feel like you want to scream and shout and somebody - but i 'm not sure who i 'm meant to scream and shout at			2
' mrs @entity8 is now living in a home where she is much happier			1
however a second doctor diagnosed mrs hill with mild cognitive impairment - a less serious condition often brought on by stress or depression			1
by this point , she had sold her home dementia affects an estimated 670,000 people in @entity142 and @entity143 but experts say 350,000 of those remained undiagnosed and without access to support			1
a spokeswoman for @entity142 said misdiagnosis rates are not recorded			0
dementia specialist dr @entity148 called for the data to be collected , adding : ' i think @entity8 's story is a devastating story that none of us would want to see happen in the health service			1
' but it 's a feature of the way that we make a diagnosis of dementia			2
there is no absolute diagnostic test - it is based on the balance of probabilities			0
' ' we still do n't understand how many people in our community have dementia			2
we have a rough idea but we still do n't really understand it			0
' having an idea of the risk of pushing for that diagnosis would be a useful reality check for the government and medical profession			0
' the @entity175 has declined to comment on her case but insists that Â£ 90m is being spent annually on fighting dementia .			0

@entity8 , 88 , was distraught after doctors told her she had @entity181 's
@entity183 were *advised* she would need round - the - clock care in special home
mrs @entity8 's daughter sold her house to fund the new *accommodation*
she hated living in new home and said she did n't believe she had dementia
after 18 months , her worried daughter sought the opinion of another doctor
he declared she had mild cognitive impairment - not the same as dementia
' @entity202 moved her out of specialist home , and mrs @entity8 now happier
