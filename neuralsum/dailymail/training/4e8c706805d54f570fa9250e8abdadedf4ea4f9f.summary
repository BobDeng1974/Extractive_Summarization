newly - announced @entity1 nominee @entity0 has defended his potential awards vehicle , @entity3 , against criticism the film is a pro-war portrayal of ' a hate - filled killer who was treated like a hero '			1
the movie - directed by @entity10 and based on the memoir of @entity13 sharpshooter @entity12 , who claims to have killed more than 255 people during his six - year military career - has come under fire for celebrating a racist ' @entity18 psycho ' who referred to @entity20 as ‘ savage , despicable evil ' and enjoyed killing			1
in one part of the book @entity12 wrote : ' i could n’t give a flying f -- about the @entity26			2
' but @entity0 , 40 - who has twice been nominated for a @entity1 but missed out both times - has hit back , saying the film is one man 's story about being a soldier and should n't be treated as a political compass for or against the war			1
he was shot dead at a gun range in 2013 ' my hope is that if someone is having a political conversation about whether we should or should not have been in @entity26 , whether the war is worth fighting , whether we won , whether we did n’t , why are we still there , all those ( issues ) , that really — i hope — is not one that they would use this movie as a tool for , ' @entity0 told @entity56			1
' and for me , and for @entity10 , this movie was always a character study about what the plight is for a soldier			1
' the guy that i got to know , through all the source material that i read and watched , and home videos - hours and hours - i never saw anything like that			0
' if it ’s not this movie , i hope to god another movie will come out where it will shed light on the fact of what servicemen and women have to go through , and that we need to pay attention to our vets			0
' it ’s not a political discussion about war , even … it ’s a discussion about the reality			0
' and the reality is that people are coming home , and we have to take care of them			0
' @entity0 went on to say he does n't think that @entity18 sniper is so much concerned with @entity26 as it is what it 's like to serve in a war and then go home			1
portrait : @entity0 said he and director @entity10 the story of @entity12 ( left ) as ' a character study about what the plight is for a soldier ' ' our whole idea was to do a character study about a soldier , and a soldier and a family , and what it ’s like having to deal with the schizophrenic nature of having to jostle between a home life and being in theater , ' he told @entity56			1
' i think hopefully it could be a universal story			0
' while @entity3 has received support from the military and received a nomination for @entity118 today at the @entity119 , liberals have attacked it for pandering to the narrative of a violent patriot			1
in one section of his book , @entity12 wrote of one of his four tours of @entity26 : ' if you see anyone from about sixteen to sixty - five and they ’re male , shoot ’ em. kill every male you see			2
' journalist @entity133 described @entity12 as ' an @entity18 psycho '			1
@entity135 from @entity136 said the film ' perfectly epitomizes a certain kind of @entity18 horsesh -- '			2
author @entity140 tweeted : ' i have n’t seen @entity18 sniper , but correct me if i ’m wrong : an occupier mows down faceless @entity26 but the real victim is his anguished soul ? ' the @entity147 journalist @entity146 wrote : ' the real @entity18 sniper was a hate - filled killer			2
why are simplistic patriots treating him as a hero ? ' @entity152 from @entity153 called the movie ' a @entity156 platform '			1
criticism : director @entity10 said it was a ' stupid analysis ' to say he was celebrating war or violence in a separate interview , director @entity10 , 84 , said criticism he was celebrating war and killing was a ' stupid analysis ' to make			1
' pardon me for sounding defensive , but it certainly has nothing to do with any ( political ) parties or anything , ' @entity10 , 84 , told the @entity170			0
' these fellows who are professional soldiers , @entity13 personnel or what have you , go in for a certain reason			0
' their commander - in - chief ( president @entity176 ) is a @entity177 and the administration is , and there ’s no political aspect there other than the fact that a lot of things happen in war zones			0
' like @entity0 , @entity10 maintained @entity3 was a soldier 's story , but does believe @entity12 was a hero			1
' this picture was interesting , because i ’m seeing it from the point of a person who was sort of an @entity18 hero , as far as his ability to be this ultra-sniper , ' he told @entity197			0
' and his family and his beliefs were very strong about defending the country and defending the guys who are defending the country , as a sort of an oversight warrior			0
' it was an important story , but you have to embrace his philosophy if you ’re going to tell a story about him			0
' @entity12 was shot dead at a @entity210 gun range in 2013 by a war veteran apparently suffering post traumatic stress disorder			2
movie pundits say @entity3 has a target to pull in over $ 50 million at the box office this weekend as it goes to wide release			2
it will open at 3,555 theaters across the country .			0
