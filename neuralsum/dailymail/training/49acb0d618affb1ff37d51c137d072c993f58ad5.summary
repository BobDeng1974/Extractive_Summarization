@entity1 ’s nephew has said he is now convinced the majority of the allegations of sex abuse against his uncle are true			1
@entity7 who described @entity1 as a ' friend and mentor ' said he had not believed the allegations at first , but so many had surfaced he was now ' convinced that the vast majority of them are true			1
' mr @entity7 said the scandal had shattered his family , who knew nothing about the late star ’s ‘ darker side ’			1
appalled : sir @entity1 's family pictured , from left , @entity18 ( nephew ) with partner @entity21 , @entity7 ( nephew ) and @entity22 ( niece ) with partner @entity24 , seen at his grave stone , are reeling from the allegations in a statement yesterday , they said : ‘ our feelings are in turmoil as we await the next turn of events			1
‘ we , as his closest family , have to endure further revelations on a daily basis			1
we were proud of him			2
proud of his achievements and the help he had been able to give to others			2
we knew nothing of the firestorm of allegations to come			1
’ their comments came after police revealed they believe the @entity47 presenter and @entity48 could have abused as many as 300 people over a 40 - year period			0
last month , retired headteacher mr @entity7 said he was ‘ sad and disgusted ’ that claims had been made about his uncle when he was no longer around to defend himself			1
but following weeks of ‘ very serious ’ allegations , yesterday he admitted the family had been forced to doubt their ‘ own feeling towards our uncle ’			1
the statement added : ‘ how could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing ? ‘ why would a man who raised so much money for charity , who gave so much of his own time and energy for others , risk it all doing indecent criminal acts ? ‘ how could anyone live their life doing the “ most good and most evil ” at the same time ? ’ mr @entity7 said the family have watched ‘ with horror ’ as the scandal has unfolded , adding : ‘ we became aware of the programme that was being made with allegations of a darker side to him that we knew nothing about			1
‘ like everyone else we asked the question , why now ? we could n’t find an answer			0
this was n’t the man we knew and loved			1
’ the family also sent out a message of sympathy to those alleged to have suffered at @entity1 ’s hands			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ we recognise that even our own despair and sadness does not compare to that felt by the victims			1
our hearts go out to them and we offer our sympathy and understanding in their anguish			1
’ @entity1 's nephew @entity7 says the family have been left shattered by the allegations about the disgraced dj in a @entity47 interview mr @entity7 said he could also not understand how his uncle , who did so much charity work , ' could have such a dark side to him '			1
he said : ' i have this memory of what the man was like , what he meant to me as a person			0
' i still have part of me proud of him , not proud of the way things have turned out , but proud of the things that he did in trying to help other people			0
' he went on to add that he was ' absolutely devastated and disappointed that this dark side is the side that he will be remembered for			1
' mr @entity7 , who organised @entity1 's funeral - where he described his uncle as his friend , his mentor and very much like a father to him - says the family had been proud of all of @entity1 's achievements , including the millions of pounds for charity			1
but they say the ' firestorm of allegations ' have left them deeply shocked and initially they could not believe the claims			1
he insisted the family had known nothing about the predatory side of the @entity48 the shocked nephew said the @entity140 documentary which exposed @entity1 as an alleged abuser made them all recoil in horror			1
the family have already acted in a move to ' respect victims ' by removing the elaborate headstone on @entity1 's grave			1
they said they had it ripped out of the cemetery in @entity152 to avoid it becoming a target for vandals and to also respect those who claim they were molested by the disgraced star			0
' the decision was a difficult one to make but we knew it was the right one , ' mr @entity7 said			2
@entity163 ( right ) claims her grandmother ( left ) knew about @entity1 's abusive ways but ignored them for financial reasons previously @entity1 's great niece sensationally revealed how her grandmother knew he had abused her but kept quiet to ' preserve his fame '			1
speaking on @entity140 's @entity170 , 49 , said she was molested twice by her great - uncle , once aged 12 and again three years later			2
but she said her grandmother @entity172 , @entity1 's elder sister who died in 2006 , knew he had abused her and believes she was well aware he was a prolific and predatory paedophile			1
she said her grandmother refused to confront her brother because she knew that if the @entity48 were brought to book , the comfortable lifestyle he provided for her would end			2
@entity175 , director of the the @entity177 helpline , said of the @entity179 case : ' the @entity177 helpline has never dealt with so many allegations against one individual			0
' calls about @entity185 were ' still coming in thick and fast and show little sign of slowing down ' , he added.since the allegations about @entity1 emerged , the children 's charity said , it had received 190 calls directly relating to him , which have been passed to police			1
a year ago our uncle , sir @entity1 , passed away			1
it was a shock when it happened as i had only seen him the week before and although seeming under the weather , i had no concerns over his wellbeing			0
a week later he was dead and my cousin and i were left with the task of organising his funeral			2
we were proud of him			0
proud of his achievements and the help he had been able to give to others			0
we knew nothing of the firestorm of allegations to come			2
we set out to organise the funeral knowing that he was well respected by many , many thousands of people			0
we knew that the funeral was going to grow because so many people wanted to be a part of the celebration of his life			2
we felt so honoured that so many wanted to remember him and mark his passing			0
as time passed , the grieving process enabled us to come to terms with his death			0
by the time summer arrived we were getting ready for the auction of his possessions so that , as he requested in his will , the money could go to his charities			0
it was a great success			0
we became aware of the programme that was being made with allegations of a darker side to him that we knew nothing about			1
i watched the programme in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle			0
this was n’t the man we knew and loved			2
like everyone else we asked the question , why now ? we could n’t find an answer			0
the allegations kept coming and were beginning to overwhelm us			0
media were chasing us asking for interviews as family members			2
the allegations are very serious and we began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle			0
how could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing ? why would a man who raised so much money for charity , who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts ? how could anyone live their life doing the ‘ most good and most evil ’ at the same time ? we became more aware of the outrage that many members of the public were feeling			2
we began to think that his headstone , which we had only unveiled a couple of weeks earlier could become a target for people wishing to show their emotions			0
the dignity of the cemetery , the people who are buried there and the relatives who tend the graves had to be respected			0
we took the decision to remove and destroy the headstone so that it could n’t become a focus for malicious people			0
the decision was a difficult one to make but we knew it was the right one			2
a vilification of his name , his achievements and everything he stood for followed			0
people are moving as quickly as possible to disassociate themselves from him			0
his charities , which he was so proud of , debated the prospect of removing his name from their title			0
the trustees have since decided that this was n’t enough and that the charities will have to be wound up and the monies given to other charities working in a similar field			0
records of all his efforts and the good work he had done , have been , or are in the process of being removed			0
we recognise that even our own despair and sadness does not compare to that felt by the victims			1
our thoughts and our prayers are with those who have suffered from every kind of abuse over so many years and we offer our deepest sympathy in what must have been a terrible time for all of them			1
we can understand their reluctance to say anything earlier and can appreciate the courage it has taken to speak out now			0
our hearts go out to them and we offer them our sympathy and understanding in their anguish			1
where will it all end ? who knows ? the repercussions of this scandal are enormous			0
we , as his closest family , have to endure further revelations on a daily basis			2
our feelings are in turmoil as we await the next turn of events .			2
