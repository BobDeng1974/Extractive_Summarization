having just become the highest scoring foreign born player in @entity3 history , @entity0 would be forgiven for looking ahead to his next personal milestone			1
the @entity6 power forward leapfrogged @entity7 into ninth place on the @entity3 's all - time scoring list on tuesday night , the highest among international players			1
it 's an achievement that @entity0 is proud of having spent his entire @entity3 career with @entity6 after moving to the @entity13 from @entity14 when he was 20 years old			1
but his next goal is not surpassing @entity17 in eighth place on the all - time scoring list , it 's a second @entity3 title with the @entity6			1
' when you ’re still playing it is more about winning and being on a good team , ' he said			2
' these other milestones are going to be great in 10 or 20 years when i look back at my career and show them to my daughter and maybe my grandkids one day			2
' right now i ’m still working on playing at a high level and chasing my dream – which is another championship			2
' @entity0 became the highest scoring international player in @entity3 history the 36 - year - old @entity14 is a 12 - time @entity33 and his individual accolades also include an mvp crown in 2007 and @entity36 in 2011 , the year @entity6 beat the @entity37 to be crowned @entity3 champions			1
despite all he has achieved individually with both the @entity6 and @entity14 , that solitary @entity3 title remains @entity0 's career highlight			1
it speaks volumes for a man who has become the ultimate team player and a legend in @entity6			1
' i play in a team sport and winning a championship is the ultimate , ' @entity0 said			1
' i worked so hard and in 2011 everything came together			2
' i never wanted to see myself as a big - time scorer who shoots every ball			1
i want to be efficient and wanted to come through for my team when counted on			0
hopefully i can still do that over the next couple years and play at a high level with a good team			0
the @entity6 forward moved above @entity7 into ninth place in the all - time scoring list @entity0 has spent his entire @entity3 career with @entity6 and won the @entity3 title in 2011 1			1
@entity7 26,946 * still active , as of tuesday 11 november ' the last couple of years after winning the championship have been tough			1
we did n’t even make the play - offs one year			0
that was one of the reasons why i took a huge pay cut this summer , so we can get a good team in here			0
' @entity0 continued : ' i came here a long time ago not knowing what to expect when i was 20 years old and @entity6 embraced me			1
the people here were always kind and supported me and it felt like a second home			0
' i missed @entity14 a lot in the beginning , but i found a new home here and it would not have felt right to go and play somewhere else and put on a different uniform			2
i always wanted to be in @entity6			2
it has been a great ride and i would n’t have wanted to do it anywhere else but here			0
' i lived with my parents for 20 years and when i came over i had a tough time adjusting and living by myself			0
it was a tough time but i had to get through it somehow			0
i just kept working to try and get better and learned some stuff from the older players			0
@entity6 fans celebrate @entity0 's achievement against the @entity102 on tuesday ' but if someone would have told me 17 years ago that i would pass @entity7 , i would have said “ you ’re absolutely crazy ”			1
it has been a fun ride with some great people and great supporters and the fans have been great for me all over the world			0
' @entity0 hit a jumper from just inside the three - point line early in the fourth quarter of @entity6 ' 106 - 98 win over @entity113 on tuesday to pass @entity7 , and he finished the night at 26,953 career points - seven more than the @entity115			1
' i was kind of was aware that i was n’t too far away , ' @entity0 said			2
' but once the game was going on i was solely focussing on the next shot and trying to help the team win			0
it wasn ‘ t really in my mind during the game but i was definitely aware of it before			0
' when i made the big shot i saw the crowd give me a standing ovation and then realised that was it			0
it was a very special moment to do it at home in front of the fans who have supported me in my 17 years here			0
' they gave me a standing ovation and at the next timeout they showed a video in the big screen in honour of me			0
' fans can watch @entity3 games on @entity143 and via @entity144 , the @entity3 ’s live and on - demand subscription service			2
