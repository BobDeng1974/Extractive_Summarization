by @entity0 published : 08:20 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 13:16 est , 3 april 2013 @entity1 says that across @entity4 major @entity3 units are failing to meet the target of seeing 95 per cent of patients within four hours many major hospitals have missed their national accident and emergency target every week for the last six months , it has been claimed			1
@entity1 , the @entity11 , said that major @entity3 units across @entity4 have failed to meet the target of seeing 95 per cent of patients within four hours			1
this has been the case every week since late september			0
his claims come after one @entity3 department in @entity19 was this week forced to erect an emergency tent outside because it was so overcrowded			1
mr @entity1 said new data from @entity4 shows the 95 per cent target has been missed across the @entity4 , with less than 70 per cent of patients being seen within four hours at some trusts			1
he said that compared to last year , 107,000 more patients have had to wait longer than four hours			1
‘ standards of care are deteriorating in many parts of the country as the @entity4 is dragged down by @entity30 's toxic mix of cuts and re-organisation , ’ said mr @entity1			1
‘ @entity4 's @entity3 departments are suffering their worst winter for a decade , with thousands more people waiting longer to be seen across the country			0
‘ the @entity4 has failed to hit the target almost the entire time @entity39 has been health secretary			1
he urgently needs to get a grip and focus on what matters			0
‘ almost 5,000 nursing jobs have been lost since @entity30 entered @entity44			0
ministers must develop a plan to bring all a&es in @entity4 back up to national standards			2
’ a @entity50 spokeswoman said : ‘ the @entity4 is seeing an extra one million patients in @entity3 compared to two years ago and despite the additional workload it is coping well			2
‘ patients should n't face excessive waits for treatment , which is why we provided £ 330 million to help the @entity4 cope with the extra pressure the cold weather brings			2
‘ the government is meeting its promise to deliver a real terms increase in health spending and there are now 7,000 more professionally qualified clinical staff in the @entity4 since 2010			2
in contrast , the number of admin staff has fallen by over 18,000 , and the money saved put back into frontline patient care			0
’ on monday , @entity19 and @entity72 's @entity3 department became so overcrowded that it was forced to erect an emergency treatment tent mr @entity1 ’s comments come just after it emerged that patients in @entity19 faced the prospect of being treated in a tent on monday after an @entity3 department became overcrowded			1
a treatment tent , usually reserved for use during major emergencies , was erected outside @entity19 and @entity72 as a precaution but it was not needed to treat patients			1
one ambulance crewman said : ' we are so fed - up with getting slated and being made to look as if the ambulance service is to blame for the delays - but it 's not us , it 's @entity3			0
' they want to get out and save lives			0
that 's all they want to do and they are getting caught up in a political row			0
' the tent is usually used at plane crashes and big events , such as the lord mayor 's parade			2
to put it up outside the @entity3 is unheard of			0
' another ambulance worker , who also asked to remain anonymous , said : ' it 's a mini-hospital in a tent			0
' ' it will usually have in it treatment bays , drugs , oxygen , the same stuff on board an ambulance but inside a tent - which is a lot colder			0
' hospital chief executive @entity115 said : ' the demand on emergency services over the bank holiday weekend had been exceptionally high and the ambulance tent was erected for a short period as a precautionary measure			1
