by @entity0 losing locks : eight million @entity3 women suffer from hair loss or thinning hair at some point in their lives it is pretty safe to say that my hair – namely , my worries about it thinning – is bordering on obsession			1
it ’s a concern my mother , @entity16 , shares			1
at 66 , she is worried that her good head of healthy hair is now thinning due to age			1
eight million @entity3 women suffer at some point in their lives and chemists ’ shelves heave with potions and vitamins aimed at remedying the problem			1
causes can range from hormonal and genetic to the dietary and psychological			2
i am 41 , and , despite being fastidious about eating healthily , exercising and taking a daily multivitamin , my hair often falls out in alarming amounts			2
i swap the side i part my hair and try to ignore the fact that in certain lights , you can see scalp			2
when i heard about a medical spa offering a treatment package aimed at halting hair - loss , my mother and i booked in without hesitation			1
no matter that the weekend break would set us back close to £ 2,500			2
if i counted up the amount i have spent on hair supplements , then it would be an investment			2
it was a no - caffeine , no - alcohol , no - sugar regime ( and pity the poor smokers who were not allowed to puff on site )			1
serious medical assessments were bolstered by a strict vegan diet to cleanse the system			1
but the @entity60 , set in the mountains of @entity62 , @entity63 , has been voted best medical spa by @entity65			1
the luxurious resort has played host to guests including @entity69 and @entity70			2
so if we were to suffer , we would at least do it in style			2
what ’s the treatment ? @entity60 focuses on improving health through natural therapies combined with @entity78 and the most advanced @entity80 medicine			1
the weekend programme examined every aspect of our medical history and there was a health check , then individual spa treatments			2
we were put on a macrobiotic diet – based on 60 per cent grains , plus seasonal local vegetables , seaweeds ( yes ! ) and seasonal local fruit			1
we enjoyed delicious , delicate and stunning - looking dishes which made us realise brown rice , soya and tofu can be exciting and we could forgo meat , fish , eggs and cheese without it feeling a punishment			2
hair - raising in a good way : @entity0 and her mother @entity16 visited @entity60 in @entity62 , @entity63 to try to reverse age 's effect on their hair but cutting out three double espressos and two cups of tea a day was hell			1
when i woke , i looked as if i ’d done rounds in the boxing ring – my eyes were puffed up and blackened – all part of the detoxification process , i was told			2
nutrition expert @entity118 asked if i suffered with kidney problems ( yes ) and poor circulation ( yes )			0
i spotted a chart on the wall of a woman ’s face indicating related areas			0
mum and i are both blessed with bags beneath our eyes – not related to sleep deprivation – and that area was linked to			0
the solution is to stimulate and strengthen the kidneys through diet and to make sure blood flows to the head through massage and exercise			1
a daily cup of @entity142 mu tea was prescribed to support the kidneys			0
it had an acquired bitter taste which we grew to love as it was the nearest thing we would get to a nice cuppa			0
@entity126 was reassured that due to genetics her hair is strong , but could be improved			0
@entity152 solutions a daily programme offered optional nutritional lectures and macrobiotic cooking demonstrations			1
we were to swim in the outdoor pool , then follow the indoor pool circuit which encouraged circulation with hot and cold plunge pools , baths , a sauna , a steam room and an ice fountain			0
we had two daily treatments , one in the morning and one in the afternoon , either side of breakfast and lunch			0
healthy home : the @entity60 follows a no - caffeine , no - alcohol , no - sugar regime and medical assessments were bolstered by a strict vegan diet the first was a nutritive capillary treatment ( 25 minutes , € 70 ) , including nourishing , repairing and hydrating treatments			1
using @entity180 massage , essential oils were vigorously applied to stimulate the scalp			0
we felt wide awake and invigorated			0
in the afternoon came the @entity60 capillary treatment ( 50 minutes , € 120 )			1
it started with a relaxing massage using rosemary , mint and sesame oil to increase blood flow to the scalp and included massage techniques based on traditional @entity193 medicine , aided with a glass - cup method which stimulates blood circulation			0
we finished with a relaxing , warm hair masque			0
@entity60 offers an extraordinary range of preventative treatments with 100 therapists on hand			1
we could also have tried a ‘ mineral elements in hair profile ’ ( € 200 ) , a ‘ woman ’s hormonal profile ’ ( € 340 ) or the @entity205 ( € 630 ) genetic screening for osteoporosis prevention			0
. and afterwards we both followed a macrobiotic diet for three months and felt tremendous			1
it requires serious dedication long - term			0
but the essence of the programme remains with us both , which has been a surprise			0
i now drink only green tea and have turned vegan , and @entity126 limits meat to once a week			0
we ’re now both big fans of almond milk and spelt bread			0
our hair has responded brilliantly to what turned out to be simple adjustments and it was well worth the effort			0
we no longer fret if the plughole occasionally looks like a scene from a horror film			0
we simply step up the scalp self - massage and neck exercises we were taught , keep the diet in check – and talk about our next booster visit to @entity60			1

the @entity60 in @entity63 vows to help you strengthen your locks
treatment includes head massages and a strict macrobiotic diet regime
