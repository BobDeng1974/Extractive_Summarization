so , it transpires , it is going to take more than the zap of a turbo smile from a £ 60million footballer to lighten the mood at @entity5			1
it will take more than the dazzle of his diamonds and the glisten of gel in his hair			2
it has been a gloomy few days of introspection since the mauling in @entity16 and @entity18 ’s unveiling of @entity19 , the most expensive player ever signed by a @entity21 club , was not enough to unfurrow @entity23 ’s brow			1
there would be no quick fix , no miracles and no magic , warned @entity28 , stern beside @entity29			1
the mood was enhanced by the choice of going down by the @entity32 as the soundtrack to the event			2
unveiling : @entity19 ( left ) poses with his number 7 shirt alongside new manager @entity23 welcome : @entity28 ( left ) walks along the pitch at @entity5 with new signing @entity29 on thursday theatre of dreams : @entity29 poses with his new shirt after signing for @entity18 for a record fee of £ 60m the arrival of @entity29 means @entity18 now have the most expensive squad in the league @entity18 £ 401.2m @entity44 £ 344.15m @entity45 £ 341.8m @entity46 £ 245.8m @entity47 £ 209.5m @entity29 must have wondered why no - one had warned him			1
still , the 26 - year - old @entity49 seemed happy enough to be there , nodding and explaining through an interpreter how he was here to win trophies and help @entity18 back to the top			1
he would , he stressed , be happy to play in any position , and was not concerned by his price tag			0
his unburdened delight began to ebb away , however , when @entity28 intervened and suggested his own words ought to be translated for the benefit of @entity29 , in effect providing the new arrival with a handy summary of a dismal start to the season			1
it certainly is n’t like this at the @entity67			0
when @entity69 broke records to sign @entity71 they packed the stadium and put their new galactico on a podium to juggle the ball while fireworks were shot into the sky			1
@entity29 was shoved before the in - house television station for a quick interview , snapped holding his new shirt and sat before a brisk press conference , held without irony in the @entity83 on a day when the @entity85 draw was going on without @entity18 for the first time in nearly 20 years			1
@entity29 will wear @entity87 7 , an iconic shirt at @entity5			1
facing the media : @entity90 ( left ) speaks during a press conference at @entity5 as @entity29 looks on in charge : @entity28 listens to a journalist 's question as the gathering takes place in the @entity83 ‘ i was aware of the importance of the no 7 shirt , ’ said @entity29			1
‘ @entity99 had spoken to me at @entity69 and told me how important it was			1
the club also wanted me to wear it so i want to live up to it			2
’ @entity99 said on thursday night : ‘ i wish the best to him , he ’s a fantastic player , he ’s going to do well at @entity18			1
i said to him “ no 7 is a big responsibility ” but he will be able to take that shirt because he ’s a fantastic player			1
personally , it ’s a shame for me because i liked @entity29			2
’ @entity18 , of course , have no pretension to mimic @entity69 ’s obsession with glitz and glamour			1
for all their global reach and commercial power , they have always been a club where substance matters more than style			2
and perhaps here is where @entity29 fits in , with his reputation for humility and hard work , which he combines on the pitch with his pace and superhuman stamina to great effect			1
‘ he is a very modest guy , ’ said @entity28			0
‘ he wants to work			2
he showed that last year			0
he played 52 matches and gave 22 assists			0
how many players can say that ? it means you are a social human being and in the football world that is not always the case			0
taunt : @entity140 ’ kit sponsor @entity138 parked this cheeky van outside @entity5 ‘ he will be a player who can enjoy defence			1
it is important that he is a team player			2
he can accelerate our play but also plays in interests of the team			0
what ’s more , he means i can change the system			0
‘ he played at @entity69 not only on the right wing but also in midfield			2
that ’s also a reason we are convinced he will succeed			0
but he has been with us for two days			0
he has to adapt to the team and the team to him			0
we can not expect that he is a miracle after two days			0
no , you have to work for the miracle and he knows that			2
’ patience and time was central to the message , as well it might be			0
@entity166 was granted only one summer transfer window after replacing sir @entity168 and @entity28 is three days from the end of his first			0
asked if he was surprised at the scale of the work required , only 15 months after @entity18 ’s last title , the @entity170 said : ‘ yes , but that is looking at the past			1
that ’s a question i do n’t want to answer because i want to show my respect to @entity166 and mr @entity168			0
@entity177 to see you : new signing @entity29 smiles for the cameras at his @entity5 unveiling ‘ we have to look at the future and we are doing that by restoring and rebuilding a new team			1
that costs time — i ’m sorry to say that , sorry for the fans because the fans are amazing			0
we lost 4 - 0 in @entity140 and they were singing and supporting the players			0
i hope we will fulfil their expectations , but it is not done in one month			0
’ @entity18 will attempt to follow the signing of @entity29 with more , with sights set on @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			1
they will also hope to soon have @entity197 available			2
he was in @entity69 on thursday awaiting a work permit			1
‘ also , players shall go , ’ said @entity28			0
@entity200 last night had an £ 8m bid for @entity202 accepted , with @entity203 and @entity204 also keen			0
@entity205 is in talks with @entity207 and @entity208 and @entity209 has returned to @entity210 on loan			0
@entity29 can be forgiven if his head was in a spin			2
he must have wondered what was changing in the background as he smiled for the cameras in the crash of the flashbulbs			0
patient wait : @entity197 signed for @entity18 last week but is still awaiting a work permit video i will help @entity18 return to the top - @entity29			1

@entity29 is the most expensive player ever signed by a @entity21 club
