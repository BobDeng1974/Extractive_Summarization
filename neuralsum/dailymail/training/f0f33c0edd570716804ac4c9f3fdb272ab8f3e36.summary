@entity1 's chaotic first days in charge of @entity3 will end with confirmation that @entity5 and @entity6 are to be dismissed			1
@entity5 was told he would be fired after a short meeting at the club 's @entity9 training centre on monday morning and @entity6 ' fate was sealed later in the afternoon			1
fellow @entity3 coaches @entity12 and @entity13 have also been relieved of their duties , while @entity1 was pictured at @entity3 under - 21s ' 3 - 1 loss to @entity18 with long - term allies bernd @entity21 and @entity20			1
@entity25 has been with @entity1 even longer , serving as fitness coach at @entity27 from 2004 and joining @entity33 's team at @entity29 and @entity28			1
incredibly head coach @entity34 , who has been deposed by @entity1 , is still agonising over a decision to return to @entity3 to work alongside the @entity37 manager			1
@entity39 chief executive @entity38 has been attempting to mediate after @entity34 believed he had been fired on friday night			2
remarkably @entity3 seemed to think they can somehow persuade the former @entity41 coach to remain at the club and work alongside their new @entity37 manager			1
@entity5 feels embarrassed and humiliated by chief executive @entity44 after he was persuaded to take on the role of technical director in a @entity48 shake - up at the club			2
the former @entity51 and @entity52 manager , a popular and highly - respected figure in the game , has been at @entity3 for just over three months			2
despite his huge experience within the game , @entity1 believes they can not work together as @entity3 battle to escape relegation from the bottom of the @entity61			1
not looking good : @entity3 assistant manager @entity6 has been told to stay away from the training ground short spell : @entity5 has left @entity3 after being appointed in december arrival : @entity1 arriving at @entity3 's @entity9 training ground for the first time hardline : @entity3 's players are in for a rude awakening when @entity1 takes charge of training , according to @entity27 chief @entity72 introduction : @entity1 meets his players for the first time replaced : @entity3 moved to replace @entity34 with @entity1 as they seek to climb away from the foot of the @entity61 table @entity6 has similar respect in the game , but he was ordered away from the @entity3 training ground by @entity44 and spent the day at home			1
behind the scenes @entity3 were attempting to come to a compromise agreement after their disastrous handling of the situation developing at @entity85			2
the clumsy leadership structure at @entity3 has also been highlighted after a series of rows involving coaching staff and players during their slump to the bottom of the @entity61			0
tensions were so high at the training ground and in the dressing room that it has threatened to spill over before @entity3 took the dramatic decision to replace their @entity99 head head coach			0
@entity100 and @entity34 were involved in spectacular row after the central defender was axed from the team who drew 2 - 2 at @entity41			2
@entity100 paid the price for a diabolical performance in the 1 - 0 defeat at home to @entity109 in the @entity111 fourth round on february 4			0
well - versed : @entity112 ( right ) is one of three players in the squad to have experienced @entity1 's methods in trouble : @entity3 are four points adrift of safety @entity34 decided to drop him for the trip to @entity121 and replaced him with rookie centre half @entity122			1
hangeland was livid with the decision and although he was named as a substitute , he was involved in a heated confrontation with the club ’s head coach following the decision			0
@entity100 has claimed there was no disagreement			0
right - back @entity133 , who signed for the club permanently in the summer following a successful season long loan spell , was also involved in a training ground bust - up with midfielder @entity138 in the head coach ’s final days in charge			0
it ’s understood that a row between the pair escalated over a training ground tackle , but it did not result in a physical confrontation			0
despite the obvious problems on the field , @entity3 ’s players liked @entity34 and had respect for his attempts to change the culture of the club			1
but that does not hide the fact that they are bottom of the @entity61 and have just 12 games to avoid relegation to the @entity158			0
they have not won in the @entity61 since january 1 , when they beat @entity52 2 - 1			0
@entity3 ’s next clash is with relegation threatened @entity161 at the weekend and then head into the @entity162 with @entity163 the following week			0
however , there was one bright note of @entity24 ' loss , as january signing @entity167 completed his first ninety minutes for his new side			0
new boy : @entity167 completed his first ninety minutes in a @entity3 shirt during monday 's defeat			2
