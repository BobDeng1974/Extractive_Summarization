by @entity0 @entity1 wants to use his @entity3 triumph as a springboard to further success this season , but insists he has never thought about matching @entity8 ' record haul of major titles			1
@entity1 's win at @entity11 earlier this month made him just the third player after @entity8 and @entity13 to win three majors by the age of 25			1
and although the @entity18 would love to win a second @entity21 @entity20 title next week before trying to complete a career @entity23 in next year 's masters , @entity8 ' tally of 18 major titles is not on his mind			1
' the next number in my head is four			0
' i 've won three and would like to win my fourth and just try and keep going like that , one after the other and whatever number it adds up to at the end of my career is great			1
i do n't want to put that pressure on myself , that burden of a number to try and attain			0
' you need goals but that 's too much of a long - term goal , i like to set shorter - term goals because all those little ones will help you achieve the long - term goal in the end			0
' i know how many majors the greats of the game have won but i never wanted to compare myself			1
at least at the end of my career there 's not going to be a disappointment ' oh , i wanted to get to 15 but i only got 12			2
bummer ! " ' video the open championship : @entity69 highlights making kiss - story : @entity1 became third player to win three majors by 25 - behind @entity8 and @entity13 first of many ? the @entity18 won his first major title at the @entity74 in @entity75 two 's up ! @entity1 will be looking to repeat his success at the 2012 @entity20 @entity1 can reclaim top spot in the world rankings for the first time since march last year with a victory at @entity82 , before turning his attention to the final major of the year at @entity85			1
' this course is going to set up well for me this week , ' added @entity1 , who revealed he had taken pictures of the @entity89 in various places , even ' on top of the toilet			2
' ' it 's a long course anyway and it 's playing just that bit longer with all the rain they 've had			0
it 's a course that i 've done pretty well on before and i feel comfortable on			0
@entity85 should set up well for me so i can definitely have a chance			0
disaster ! @entity1 should have won his fist major at the 2011 masters but for a final day meltdown ' @entity104 number one is a big goal of mine and i 've never won a @entity32			1
that 's another thing i 'd like to knock off the list			0
' i think every time you have success you have to reassess your goals			0
it 's two - thirds through the season and a lot of the goals i set for myself at the start of the year i have already achieved so that 's when you have to reassess , celebrate that for a couple of days but then move on , keep moving forward and thinking about what you want to achieve			2
' at the end of the year you can really reflect on everything you 've done and enjoy it			0
i feel like i have a lot of momentum and i can carry that through to the end of the year and hopefully ride that and play some golf similar to what you saw at @entity130			2
' help the aged ? @entity1 is against @entity131 being included in the @entity133 team victory at @entity130 also took @entity1 top of the @entity133 qualification standings , but the 25 - year - old does not think his senior open counterpart should join him on the team at @entity140			1
@entity131 's record 13 - shot win at @entity142 has led to speculation the 56 - year - old could be considered as a wild card by captain @entity146 , but @entity1 said : ' i think the team dynamic is pretty good at the minute with the mix that we 've got and to bring someone in that has n't spent much time around us might n't be the best			1
' he 's not playing against the regular guys week in and week out but he 's playing great golf obviously and what he 's done this year , and @entity158 ( @entity159 , who has won two senior majors in 2014 ) as well has been fantastic			2
if they were to be involved as vice-captains or something then i 'd be all for that , but i do n't think they should be on the team			0

@entity1 is not thinking of rivalling @entity8 ' tally of major titles
the @entity8 won 18 major titles during his *illustrious* career
@entity1 became only third player to win three majors after his victory at @entity3 at @entity11 , @entity130
@entity18 needs only @entity179 to complete his @entity23
@entity1 is *competing* at @entity181 ahead of the @entity21 @entity20
