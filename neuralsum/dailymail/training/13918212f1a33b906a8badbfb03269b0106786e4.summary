the pressure is getting to @entity1			1
so much so he ’s become a poor man ’s @entity2			1
it ’s funny how @entity2 was castigated for headbutting someone on the touchline , yet if @entity1 charges towards an opposition manger and pushes him in the chest with both hands during a game , he gets away with it			1
does the @entity12 get away with it because he ’s been in the job for a long time ? because he ’s untouchable ? because of the ridiculous amount of respect afforded to him by seemingly everyone in the game ? @entity1 ( left ) shoves @entity21 manager @entity20 during his side 's 2 -- 0 defeat on sunday @entity24 manager @entity2 headbutts @entity26 midfielder @entity25 back in march a two - handed shove may not be as aggressive , or as likely to cause injury as a headbutt			1
but it is still an unprovoked act of aggression which brings the great name of @entity34 into disrepute , and sets a terrible example			0
yet the board have so far failed to offer any kind of statement condemning the incident , or sanctioning their manager			2
three red cards in four @entity46 games this season should be enough for @entity1 to take a look in the mirror			2
if he ever bothered to do that , he ’d realise that starting a ruck with @entity20 on the touchline at @entity53 will in no way help @entity34 achieve better results			1
it seems the @entity34 manager is more bothered about his own personal duels these days than boring stuff like tactics and team selection			0
@entity34 's players look dejected on their way to defeat at @entity53 on sunday what kind of message does @entity1 ’s aggression send to the players ? are they laughing at this manager trying to start a fight he can never win because he ’s up against a far sharper operator ? or are they thinking that they need to start getting physical with the opposition , roughing them up , pushing them without provocation ? @entity34 used to be a club that prided itself on its discipline : to some @entity80 is still the greatest manager in the club ’s history – he ’s the only @entity84 ’ manager with a statue outside the @entity86 so far			1
@entity80 believed in a “ code of conduct , ” and even sacked a player , @entity88 , on the bus home after conceding a penalty in a cup tie at @entity92 in 1933			0
@entity80 even refused to allow @entity88 back into @entity93 to collect his boots			0
legendary @entity34 manager @entity80 was known for setting high standards of his players @entity97 knows what @entity80 would make of the current @entity34 manager shoving his opposite number in the chest during a game			0
it ’s a new low for a once great manager			0
@entity1 is becoming a specialist in spoiling his legacy .			2
