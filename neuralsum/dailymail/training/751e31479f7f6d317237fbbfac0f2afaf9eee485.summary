the archbishop of @entity1 today warned politicians against inflammatory language presenting immigration as a ' deep menace ' to @entity6			1
the @entity8 @entity7 said he was worried about the use of language in the debate amid an upsurge of abuse and urged people not to suggest new arrivals could ' overwhelm ' @entity6			1
his remarks came after defence secretary @entity17 sparked controversy after saying some parts of the country felt ' swamped ' by immigrants			1
archbishop of canterbury the most reverend @entity7 today warned against using inflammatory language around immigration @entity17 said he was ' careless ' to claim some towns were being ' swamped ' by immigrants mr @entity17 today admitted he was ' a bit careless ' with his words but maintained that the ' large number ' of immigrants coming from the continent was putting pressure on housing and essential services in the @entity6			1
but the archbishop of @entity1 , speaking at a @entity36 lunch today , said : ' do i worry about the language ? yes i do , i really do			1
' ' we ca n't overburden communities , we have to be realistic about that			2
but at the heart of @entity43 teaching about the human being is that all human beings are of absolutely equal and infinite value and the language we use must reflect the value of the human being and not treat immigration as a deep menace that is somehow going to overwhelm a country that has coped with many waves of immigration and has usually done so with enormous success			1
' it is part of the strength and brilliance of this country that we are so good at this , and i would hate to see us lose that			2
' under pressure from @entity64 and with a crunch by - election looming in the @entity68 and @entity69 constituency , mr @entity17 had significantly ramped up @entity71 rhetoric on the sensitive issue			1
he warned that some areas felt ' under siege ' and action was needed ' to prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers '			1
a government source said the defence secretary should have ' chosen his words better ' as @entity83 sought to calm the situation following mr @entity17 's comments			1
but the minister stood by the substance of his remarks as he acknowledged he had been careless in his choice of language			1
former @entity71 mp @entity91 is favourite to win the @entity68 and @entity69 by - election on november 20 mr @entity17 told @entity93 : ' i was a bit careless with my words , i accept that			1
but , yes , there is pressure now , there are a large number of people coming here from the rest of @entity105 - this is one of the more successful economies in @entity105 and there is pressure as a result of that migration on social services , on housing , on school places for example			1
' that 's what the prime minister will be addressing when he puts forward his proposals for some kind of control			2
' @entity123 's @entity122 , chairman of the influential @entity124 , said mr @entity17 's original comments had been ' nasty , inappropriate and wrong '			1
labour leader @entity126 , campaigning with @entity127 ( left ) and the party 's candidate @entity128 ( centre ) last week politicians have faced criticism before for the use of the word ' swamped ' when talking about immigration			1
in 2002 , @entity136 refused to apologise for saying asylum seekers were ' swamping ' some @entity6 schools			2
the then @entity139 made his remarks while defending the @entity141			2
the @entity142 said they were ' hugely emotive '			2
in 1978 , @entity143 said people feared being ' swamped ' by immigration from the new @entity146 and @entity147			2
on the prospect of four million immigrants , she said : ' now , that is an awful lot and i think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture			2
' @entity157 will face questions from mps later about his government 's increasingly fraught relationship with @entity105 following @entity163 ' shock demand for an extra £ 1.7 billion from the @entity6 taxpayer			1
the prime minister is also likely to be asked about his approach to tackling immigration within the @entity168 after mr @entity17 was effectively slapped down by @entity169 yesterday			1
mr @entity157 's plan to put controlling @entity168 immigration at the heart of his renegotiation of the @entity6 's relationship with @entity163 before an in / out referendum has been met with staunch opposition from @entity177			0
finance minister @entity178 stated that ' the basic rules of the @entity168 are not up for negotiation ' following chancellor @entity182 's insistence that she would not allow ' tampering ' with the principle of free movement			0
mr @entity178 told the @entity186 : ' the principle of the freedom of movement is one of the basic principles of @entity105 integration and it can not be restricted			0
that would be incompatible with the @entity105 treaties			0
' he added : ' there is not much room to manoeuvre			0
the basic rules of the @entity168 are not up for negotiation			0
' it would be ' unthinkable ' to re-impose border controls within the @entity168 , he said			0
@entity64 's tough line on immigration and the @entity168 is seen as a major factor behind its surging popularity			0
the party came top in @entity105 elections earlier this year , and a poll has suggested it is on track to secure its second mp in the @entity68 and @entity69 by - election on november 20 - triggered by the defection of @entity91 from the @entity213			0
after being presented with the demand for a £ 1.7 billion surcharge to @entity6 budget contributions in @entity163 last week , an exasperated mr @entity157 is said to have pleaded with @entity105 counterparts to cut him some slack or they could end up with @entity219 in his chair			0
the premier has insisted the bill will not be paid by the deadline of december 1 and referred the matter to finance ministers for closer examination			0
for its part , the @entity227 has argued that the contribution revisions were calculated by independent statisticians using a standard formula agreed by all member states			0
there are questions over why the @entity235 did not see the problem coming months ago and chancellor @entity237 is also under scrutiny after it emerged that he knew days before the summit but failed to tell the pm			0
@entity64 will try to win 100 seats at the general election as it seeks to build on a surge in support , the party 's biggest donor has revealed			0
businessman @entity248 said the @entity250 party would widen its ambitions and invest in an ad campaign that would be ' seen from the @entity253 '			0
mr @entity248 , who will give another £ 1.5 million to help step up the drive , said @entity64 will be raising ' significant further funds ' as it targets many more marginal seats than the few dozen it had originally identified			0
the @entity64 leader hopes mr reckless - candidate in @entity68 and @entity69 - will become the party 's second mp he told the @entity186 : ' @entity64 is not going to lose the campaign because we do n't have enough adverts			0
' research by @entity269 for the @entity270 yesterday found that nearly a third of the public would vote @entity64 if they thought it could win in their area			0
former home office minister @entity274 warned that it would be a ' complete disaster ' if the @entity213 became ' @entity277 ' , urging the @entity278 to ' calm down ' .			1
