mystery continues to surround the origin of the 100 - year - old fragments of rubber that have been washing up on the shores of @entity5 and northern @entity6 for the last two years			1
last week , conservationists cleared more than 100 rubber sheets , two rolls of rubber , three rubber ingots and several tablets from @entity13 in @entity14			1
some theorists believe the pieces could date back to the @entity17 - and may have risen to the water 's surface after being contained for more than a century in the lost wreckage of the ship - which sunk in april 1912			1
and their perfectly - preserved quality is alarming environmentalists and sparking fears over why supposedly biodegradable materials have remained completely intact			0
the rubber blocks and sheets are in such fine condition that they could have come from a ship that had just sunk			2
but the material they are made from was popularly used around a century ago			0
conservationist @entity45 said it is worrying that the pieces , some about one metre long , are in such good condition considering the rubber is meant to be biodegradable			2
the pieces are made from gutta percha , a form of latex made from the sap of a tropical tree of the same name			0
theory : some believe the blocks may have come from the @entity17 , pictured , which sank in april 1912 the pieces are made from gutta percha , a form of latex produced from the sap of a tropical tree with the same name			1
it was used to make a wide range of items 100 years ago most of the pieces are engraved with the name @entity31 - an early 20th century rubber plantation in @entity71 , @entity34 worry : their perfectly - preserved quality is alarming environmentalists and sparking fears over why supposedly biodegradable materials have remained completely intact it was used to make a wide range of items 100 years ago , including teddy bears ' noses and golf balls , although the most common use was to insulate underwater telegraph cables			1
other sheets found washed ashore are marked ' @entity86 ' which was also an early 20th century rubber plantation in @entity87			1
since perfectly - preserved pieces of 100 - year - old rubber began to wash up on shores around northern @entity6 , several theories have been put forward to explain their mysterious appearance : similar pieces have washed up on beaches in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 and there is a @entity103 group , called @entity104 , dedicated to the mysterious rubber			1
one wild theory is that the pieces could have come from the @entity17			1
gutta percha tablets were listed on the famous ship 's manifest before it sank on april 15 , 1912 , but there is no evidence these pieces would have come from the titanic wreck			1
another possibility is that they came from a @entity119 cargo ship on it 's way from @entity87 to @entity121			0
but as the cargo is valuable , the name of the ship will not be revealed until the salvage operation is complete			0
mr @entity45 said : ' it 's a bit of a mystery			0
what we do know is that the rubber came from this plantation in @entity34 100 years ago and it was destined for @entity6 and various parts of the world , but we have no idea what it would have been used for			1
@entity31 is the name of an early 20th century rubber plantation in @entity34 ( pictured ) ' this was before plastic existed and gutta percha was used for a variety of products from the soles of shoes to insulation for early telegraph cables			1
dubbed the ' unsinkable ' ship , the @entity17 famously struck an iceberg and sank in under three hours on april 15 , 1912			2
of the 2,224 on board , 1,517 passengers and crew perished			0
it lay unseen on the ocean floor for decades , until 1985 , when an @entity154 - @entity98 expedition identified its final resting place 329 miles south - east of @entity156			0
the wreck , which was split into two sections 2,000ft apart , has now been the focus of research by scientists and historians for 25 years			2
' there is a ship that went down off the @entity165 a hundred years ago that we think it could be			1
' some people have speculated that it could be from the @entity17 , which was carrying this product when it sank			2
' in reality it seems quite unlikely but we do get objects washing up from as far as @entity173			0
' it could be that a shipwreck is gradually disintegrating , and as the hold is becoming more exposed the cargo floats to the surface and washes ashore			0
' some of the pieces have goose barnacles on them which indicates this rubber has been floating on the surface for some time as they only attach to flotsam on the ocean surface			0
' the thing we find most worrying is that this is biodegradable rubber and here it is , 100 years later , in near perfect condition			2
it is astonishing that this product has remained intact for so long			0
goose barnacles found on one of the rubber mats washed up suggests it had been floating on the surface for some time as they only attach to flotsam on the ocean surface washed up : seaweed and flotsam can be seen riding a wave at @entity13 in @entity14 ' it still looks as good as the day it was made which raises concerns about the litter we are making now			1
' scientists and various organisations make assumptions about how long things will take to break down but they do n't really know			0
' we 're leaving a long - lasting legacy and i think people will be picking up our rubbish in a thousand years			0
' mysterious : cargo with the word @entity31 has washed up on northern @entity219 shores for two years			2

mystery surrounds fragments - which first started washing up two years ago
last week more than 100 pieces were *deposited* on @entity13 in @entity14
identical ' @entity31 ' engraved tablets have appeared all over @entity6
@entity31 was a 20th centruy rubber plantation in @entity33 , @entity34
some believe the pieces come from wreck of the @entity17 - which sunk in 1912
