by @entity0 published : 22:49 est , 16 november 2012 updated : 22:49 est , 16 november 2012 ' it was very frightening ' : @entity2 nearly died from a flesh - eating bug after being bitten by a spider in her local park a jogger almost died after being bitten by a spider and infected with a deadly bug			1
@entity2 , 29 , was doing press - ups in her local park when the spider bit her right thigh			1
within days , her leg had swollen to twice its normal size			0
the condition was caused by a rare flesh - eating bug , which entered her body via the spider bite wound			2
doctors told miss @entity2 she would die unless they removed part of her thigh , which could have left her disabled for life			1
but , miraculously , she managed to fight off the infection naturally			1
her case follows that of @entity27 , who almost lost an arm when she was bitten by a household spider			2
recovering in hospital yesterday , miss @entity2 , a broadcaster who worked on the sailing events at this summer ’s @entity31 , said she was lucky to be alive			1
she assumed the bite was from a mosquito when it appeared after she exercised in @entity35 , @entity36 , eight days ago			1
but by the following day , it began to swell , with the redness spreading down her leg			0
she went to her local @entity41 drop - in centre , which prescribed antibiotics , but when the swelling became unbearable her parents took her to @entity45			2
doctors at @entity47 in @entity36 were baffled , originally diagnosing an abscess			1
they monitored the swelling every two hours and gave antibiotics intravenously			0
but by monday morning , they realised she had all the symptoms of necrotising fasciitis , an infection that eats away at human flesh			2
‘ it was very frightening , ’ said miss @entity2 , who spent seven years competing as a professional sailor			1
‘ one minute it was just a bite and then the next minute i ’m in @entity45			0
it looked as if it would have been surgery or death			0
‘ they told me , “ you ca n’t kill it with drugs , the only way to get rid of it is to cut it out ”			0
’ life - threatening : @entity2 's wound 24 hours ( left ) and 36 hours ( right ) after the bite in @entity35 miraculous recovery : doctors said @entity2 ( left , 48 hours after the bite ) would die unless they removed part of her leg , but as seen here ( right ) the infection recovered naturally but before doctors could operate , the swelling began to subside			1
by yesterday , the infection was all but cleared up and miss @entity2 was preparing to go home			1
‘ i ’m a medical marvel			0
the doctors could n’t believe it , ’ she said			0
doctors said she must have an extremely strong immune system , as the bug kills up to a quarter of those infected			0
‘ they said that because i ’m fit and strong my body must have stopped the bacteria getting absolute hold of me , ’ miss @entity2 said			2
‘ my body has been fighting it all week – i ’m exhausted			0
‘ it ’s absolutely amazing that all this happened just because of a spider bite			0
i ’ve travelled the world doing potentially dangerous things and i ’ve been fine			0
i ca n’t believe that this has happened to me here at home in @entity36			2
’ on thursday , civil servant @entity97 , 31 , from @entity36 , told the @entity98 how she developed compartment syndrome , causing the flesh on her arm to die , after she was bitten as she slept .			1
