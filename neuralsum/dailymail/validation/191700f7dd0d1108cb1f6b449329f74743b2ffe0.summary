if it were possible for anything to be hot in @entity2 this winter , it was the newfangled ' ice bikes ' that debuted at an outdoor skating rink			1
the bicycles on ice skates were an immediate hit when they glided onto the @entity8 the day the new rink opened on the city 's waterfront			1
since that december day , the bundled riders who have ignored breath - taking cold to rent them have convinced inventor @entity13 that she 's onto something			1
that , and the inquiries from several other cold - weather cities in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 interested in rolling them out next year			0
' i thought i might end up being the laughingstock of the city			1
' instead , she is relishing being part of @entity2 's efforts to revitalize its waterfront and draw people year - round , even when the @entity46 breeze is something more endured than enjoyed			0
the bikes give even nonskaters a chance to try out the ice , along with the warm nuts , hot cocoa and craft beer sold at nearby kiosks			2
@entity13 's family business , @entity56 of @entity2 , rented pontoon bikes that let riders pedal the @entity59 in warmer months			1
then economic development officials put out a call for ideas for the 33,000 - square - foot ice rink being built nearby on a recreation of the @entity65			2
' they said the ice is going to be pretty large , and they thought they might need something more than just skating , ' ms @entity13 said			1
curling , hockey and broomball leagues emerged			0
' i thought : ` what a perfect opportunity to go from water biking to ice biking , ' ms @entity13 said			1
the 26 - inch bikes work with a dull blade in the front and a rectangular base attached to an ordinary bike frame the inventor had looked up ' things to do on ice ' on the @entity26 and saw that bikes that ride on ice were already being used in @entity28 , she told the @entity86			1
she bought a bike off the rack at @entity89 and worked with @entity90 and fabricating in @entity92 on a design			1
the bikes had to be sturdy , not tip and co-exist with ice skaters			2
prototype testing showed that sharper blades , like on ice skates , were too fast , as were flat blades that worked like a ski			2
the finished product is a 26 - inch bike that sits on a rectangular base with a duller blade replacing the front wheel			1
while originally scared that the bikes would damage the ice , ms @entity13 told the @entity108 ' the rink guards said they did as much to the ice as a 5 - year - old would do while ice skating			1
' stainless steel so they do n't rust in the snow , the contraptions ride like a regular bicycle , only without the need to balance			2
riders brake by pedaling backward			0
' it 's pretty neat , ' said @entity121 , of @entity122 , after giving a bike a spin			2
' they take a little getting used to			0
' ' but once you get used to it , it 's a pretty nice ride			0
' ms @entity13 said there were hours - long waits for the bikes during a warm december and riders have persisted despite a frigid and snowy winter in @entity2 mr @entity121 , who has parkinson 's disease , said he rides a three - wheel bike in the nice weather and likes the idea of a winter alternative			1
the inaugural year had 15 bikes on the ice on weekends only , with riders paying $ 10 for a half - hour turn			2
ms @entity13 said there were hours - long waits for the machines during a warm december			1
riders have persisted despite a winter that has seen nine daily records broken for low temperatures			0
friday was the 60th day in a row that there was at least an inch of snow at @entity155 and the 30th of a snowpack of at least 20 inches			0
soon ice bikers may be able to outfit their own bikes to ride on the abundant ice			0
there are plans to sell kits that will let people convert a cycle for about $ 1,500 and the company is hoping for orders from other cities will make for a busy ' offseason			0
' ice bikes of @entity2 , the name @entity13 chose for the venture , is laser - cut into the running board			1
it was important , she said , that her city get its due if the bikes took off			0
she also wants to keep production local , after seeing relatives lose jobs during @entity2 's economic struggles			0
' it 's been , ' she said , ' an incredible ride so far			0
' @entity170 of @entity2 plans to sell kits that will let people convert a cycle for about $ 1,500 and the company is hoping for orders from other cities			0

@entity13 bought a bike at @entity89 and began *experimenting*
@entity191 thought her creation might make her a laughingstock
bike with rectangular base glides easily on the ice , with no need to balance
