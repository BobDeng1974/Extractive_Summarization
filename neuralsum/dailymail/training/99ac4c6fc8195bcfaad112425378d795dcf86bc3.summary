it has taken decades for factory bosses in @entity2 to wake up to the idea that allowing their workers to sleep on the job is good for productivity			1
so for half an hour every day , these employees at a plant in @entity10 are allowed to settle back in their spring - back chairs and grab some precious shut - eye			1
sitting in a chair might not be the most relaxed way of dropping off to sleep , as shown in this photo , but this is a vast improvement from years gone by when slumbering at the work desk was treated as a cardinal sin and often meant instant dismissal			0
hard at rest : @entity2 electronics factory workers still wearing their protective clothing take their officially - sanctioned post-lunch naps granting official permission for workers to enjoy an apres - lunch nap at their benches is all part of reforms that have been implemented in recent years - and factories are reaping the benefits in increased productivity			1
the ‘ sleeping on the job ’ rule has benefited workers so much that the @entity2 government now happily reveals that there has been a 30 per cent increase in work flow since it came about , combined with the introduction of a 40 - hour working week , a drop in eight hours			1
this picture was taken by photographer @entity45 who is well qualified to understand why even grabbing a nap in a chair is a matter of great comfort - for he is a former employee from a number of factories producing toys and electronic products			0
later learning photographic skills , he embarked on a project to observe what he says is the evolution of the manufacturing world , taking more than 40,000 photos revealing the various conditions his comrades were working under			2
he recalls how , in 1995 at the age of 22 , he arrived in the city of @entity10 along with many young @entity2 from the villages seeking work in the burgeoning export - oriented industry			2
the factories chose workers aged between 18 and 25 because the conditions were demanding - 15 hour shifts six or seven days a week with only short breaks for as little as 34p an hour			0
the workers receiving the on - the - clock naps are based in @entity74 ( pictured ) , in @entity2 's @entity10 but since 2005 there have been vast improvements in working conditions , with salary increases , dormitories being provided for workers who prefer to grab a nap lying down , renovated dining halls and leisure areas where workers can play table tennis or simply relax			1
some factories have even helped to provide the children of their workers with education and make clean drinking water available to them			0
but in an increasing number of factories these days , the greatest torture - sleep deprivation - is becoming a thing of the past			0
well - rested workers are happy workers , bosses are now agreeing .			0

@entity2 factory employees allowed a 30 minute nap every day after lunch
government claims napping rule has *boosted* productivity by 30 per cent
it is one of many rules to have vastly improved factory working conditions
