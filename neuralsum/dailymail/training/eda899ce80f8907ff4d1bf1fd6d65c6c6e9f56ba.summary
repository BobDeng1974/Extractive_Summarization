a @entity0 : all @entity2 contestant recreated the @entity4 gown worn by @entity6 nominee @entity5 at last night 's @entity6 ceremony - in just five hours			1
@entity8 , 27 , from @entity9 , worked through the night in order to finish the design , which was modeled by @entity13 host @entity12 during this morning 's broadcast			1
' i picked up a couple of fabrics [ before the ceremony aired ] , ' the designer explained to today anchor @entity20			2
i did n't have any lace but i had this red leather leftover and i thought that it would give that same look that you can see with the detailing on the side and on the belt			0
' so i used that and then did the scalloping detail on the neckline , and we have a close enough dress of what it would have been for me to have done it in five or six hours			0
' while the dress was not an exact replica of the beautifully - detailed lace - embellished gown worn by @entity5 last night , both @entity63 and @entity12 agreed that @entity8 had done the best job possible with the materials that she had available			1
' we should say that @entity5 's dress is a @entity4 dress , i mean it 's fabulous and beautiful , ' @entity63 said , before asking @entity72 : ' you did this in how many hours ? ' five hours , i have n't slept ! ' the reality star admitted			1

' despite the frantic rush to get the design finished and fitted in time for @entity12 to wear it on the show , @entity8 confessed that she had a great time taking part in the challenge - and took to @entity96 shortly after appearing on the show to thank the today team for having her			1
