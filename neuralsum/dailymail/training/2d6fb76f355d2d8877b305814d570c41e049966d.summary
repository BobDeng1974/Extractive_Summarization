women in developing countries are putting their health at risk by carrying out a practice known as ' dry sex '			1
this involves drying out the vagina using substances from sand to pulverized rock to bleach , in order to make sex more pleasurable for men dry sex is known to be carried out in @entity43 and @entity44 , and @entity45			1
it is borne out of a cultural belief that men find sex more pleasurable if a woman 's vagina is dry , and that men will reject women whose vaginas have been ‘ stretched out ’ by sex			1
to achieve dryness , women insert , chalk , sand , pulverized rock , herbs , paper or sponges before sex , according to journalist ms @entity13 , who has reported on the practice in @entity60			1
they also douse their vaginas in detergents , antiseptics , alcohol and bleach			1
women in @entity68 , @entity45 , even ' smoke out ' their vaginas by standing over burning herbs , @entity66 reports			0
in other areas of @entity45 it is common to insert a cigar - shaped stick made of a plant root			0
while @entity79 consultation papers show global health officials are aware the problem exists , most of the research on it is decades old and there are no broad figures on its prevalence			0
a 2009 study looking at how dry sex spreads @entity5 in @entity88 women found knowledge of the practice was widespread			1
around two - thirds of the 812 women polled had used traditional dry sex medicines at some point in their lives , and about half were currently using them			1
but a reluctance to discuss sexual health meant the practice was not debated			1
the researchers concluded : ' most of the available information has been anecdotal , speculative or inadequate - mainly because of cultural reluctance to discuss or investigate personal sexual issues			0

in other areas of @entity45 , it is common to insert a cigar - shaped stick made of a plant root into the vagina			0
not only is this practice extremely painful for the women involved , it can lead to cuts , sores and inflammation in the vagina , and increases the chance of a condom breaking			1
these factors increase the chance of the women contracting @entity5			1
the practice is known to be carried out in @entity43 and @entity44 , and @entity45			0
similarly , a sexual health clinician and campaigner in @entity60 told vice most people are aware of the problem but it is not talked about , and has n't received enough attention from the country 's @entity158 for policies to be drafted			2
dr @entity161 , commonly known in @entity60 as dr eve , said the continued practice of dry sex shows the lack of education relating to equality and women 's rights in the area			1
' it 's definitely a class issue , ' she told vice			0
' basically , a woman 's reputation depends on the size of her vagina			2
' among women who are less informed and less educated , there 's an unbelievable ignorance around the idea the vagina adapts to the penis			2
' she explained that both men and women fail to understand that the vagina is capable of expanding during sex - and then back to its usual size afterwards			2
there is also an incorrect cultural belief that if a woman has a partner with a large penis , her vagina will remain permanently ' stretched ' - and future partners will think she is promiscuous			0
the practice is ingrained in culture , passed between generations of women , she added			0
she continued : ' men are n't saying to women , " @entity199 in your vagina "			2
' instead , they insinuate a woman is promiscuous due to the state of her genitalia , she explained			0
for women dependent on their boyfriends or husbands , attaining commitment and pleasing them is extremely important			0
the idea that pain is normal or acceptable during sex has taken hold , she adds , and most women in @entity60 would not think of sexual pleasure as something they necessarily have a right to			2
dr @entity218 said : ' i 've been part of a task force with the @entity221 , and we 've launched the declaration of sexual rights - the right to pleasure - and we 've been really pushing that			0
the practice of dry sex can cause sores and cuts in the vagina , and can make it more likely a condom will break during sex			1
these factors increase compound the spread of @entity5			1
here , the virus is pictured under the microscope ' women are surprised that 's one of their rights			0
' we know 33 percent of women have and tolerate painful penetration			0
that becomes part of what they expect from sex			0
' dr @entity218 has a radio show which attempts to dispel myths about sexual health			2
she also hosts seminars for young adults and parents in order to educate people about healthy sexual practices			0
' it 's about educating people and trying to raise awareness , ' she said			0
' the conversation began when we realized @entity5 was impacting more heterosexual women in @entity60 than gay men			2
' there was a drive then to say to women : " do n't put @entity267 in your vagina ; do n't dry your vagina out			2
" but the conversation has n't gotten going , and women are suffering			0
' she draws similarities between the practice of dry sex in developing countries and the vaginoplasty operations @entity281 women undergo in order to tighten their vagina			1
' they 're having their own genital mutilation , ' she said of the women who opt for these procedures			0
' it 's just a little more advanced and expensive than putting creams in your vagina			0
' but is n't the principal the same ? it 's incredibly unhealthy as well to go have your vagina tightened because you want to have a honeymoon experience or have your partner think you 're youthful			0
