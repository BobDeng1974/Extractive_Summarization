‘ i miss my dad every day but i 'm so proud i was his daughter			0
‘ please put your name on the organ donor list so you can save lives just like my dad			0

the corneas of eyes were taken so someone has a new set of eyes			0
‘ tubes from his neck were taken to help with heart operations			0
people do n’t realise what can be recycled and give people a much better life , or even save a life			2
‘ @entity11 was a care assistant , and we 'd spoken about him being on the organ donor list			1
‘ his attitude was “ when you 're gone , you 're gone ” - and i did n't think twice about giving the hospital permission to use his organs to help other people			1
‘ we have been told that a 29 - year - old man has been given @entity11 's heart			1
‘ if it contains just even a little bit of the love @entity11 had for his family , then the person receiving it is very lucky - as he 's got a heart from a very good man			1
‘ he managed to help people even after his death , and although we all miss @entity11 more than i could possibly put into words , it is comforting to know that he stopped four other families going through the same pain that we have			1
’ through his death , mr @entity43 saved at least four lives			2
his family has been told that his heart was given to a 29 - year - old man mr @entity43 died on his 39th birthday - just hours after complaining of a severe headache			0
he had been suffering from headaches for two weeks before the aneurysm , but had put the symptoms down to stress			0

he was found to have a ruptured aneurysm after suffering severe headaches , vomiting and weakness a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel in the brain that is caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall			1
as the blood passes through the weakened blood vessel , the blood pressure causes it to bulge outwards like a balloon			0
most brain aneurysms only cause noticeable symptoms if they rupture - this can cause extensive brain damage			0
only about one in 12,500 people in the @entity162 suffer a ruptured brain aneurysm every year			1
mr @entity43 ( pictured with sons @entity128 and @entity18 ) has inspired his family to campaign for more people to join the organ donor register mrs @entity7 said : ‘ he could n't speak or stand			1
‘ when they took him into surgery there had been so much tension and build - up from the fluid on his brain and he 'd been starved of oxygen , there was just nothing they could do			0
‘ they said they also found a pea - sized malignant tumour , but that had n't caused this , it 's just been one of those things , nothing anyone could have predicted			0
‘ the children were devastated			0
they could n't understand why their dad had n't come home for the birthday tea they had planned for him			0
‘ i became involved with organ donation , and when i went to a meeting earlier this year , @entity7 wanted to come with me - but i would n't allow her to have any more time off school			1
‘ so she decided to write a letter from her for me to read out instead - and everyone was so touched			2
’ she added : ‘ it 's been incredibly tough			0
@entity11 and i were married for almost 10 years , and he was my best friend			2
‘ i used to call him mr perfect , and all my friends used to joke they wished their husbands were as perfect as @entity11			2
‘ he 's left a huge hole in our lives , but i 'm glad that we have been able to use something awful to campaign for something positive to happen			0
‘ we will keep campaigning in @entity11 's name			2
