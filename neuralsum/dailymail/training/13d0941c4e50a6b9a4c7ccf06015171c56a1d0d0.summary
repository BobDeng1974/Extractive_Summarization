by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 24 october 2013 ' @ natsecwonk ' : under an anonymous @entity3 account @entity1 bashed his bosses and other @entity6 elites the man that was fired from his @entity10 job for making anonymous attacks on administration officials on @entity3 may now be investigated for possibly hiring prostitutes			1
@entity1 was fired on tuesday after he was unmasked as the man behind the @ @entity16 account that had captivated so much of @entity6 by taking shots at politicians and hinting of his exclusive knowledge			1
now investigators @entity1 , who is married , may be connected to another anonymous account that frequently made mentions of hiring prostitutes			1
while @entity1 has come forward and put out a statement apologizing for the ' inappropriate and mean - spirited comments ' that he made via @ @entity25 , he made no mention of any connection to the second account , called @ @entity29			1
that account has now been shut following the swarm of attention , but @entity33 reports that it directed a number of tweets at self - identified escorts			2
at one point , @ @entity29 wrote about @entity39 's ' tsunami of gorgeous and sensual escorts '			1
just three days later , it directed a message to a woman who identified herself as a ' luxury companion and escort ' and wrote ' i hopey ou know that i reminisce fondly about our date			0
do let me know if you ever find your way back to @entity6 ' a second account ? some believe @entity1 may be behind this second parody account , and if so , it will be problematic for him as it frequently discusses soliciting prostitutes if the two accounts are connected , @entity1 may face legal problems regarding his alleged use of prostitutes			1
not only is solicitation a crime , but there are political concerns as well since @entity1 's wife is a well - respected advisor on the @entity67			1
aside from the moral repercussions of cheating , there is inevitably concern about the prospect of being blackmailed for information or access , based either on his now - former role as a non-proliferation director on the @entity78 or his wife @entity79 's role in the @entity67			1
after first refusing to comment to @entity83 's @entity82 about the scandal when it first broke on wednesday , saying that it would ' affect his ability to get a new job , ' he followed up with a formal statement			0
' beer goggles ' : @entity1 tweeted that @entity91 must have been wearing beer goggles when she married @entity93 international : he also made light of @entity96 ' marriage to @entity97 before she was appointed as the current @entity99 ambassador to the @entity100 ' it has been a privilege to serve in this @entity102 and i deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me , ' he said in the statement			2
he went on to explain that it ' started out as an intended parody account of @entity6 culture '			2
those comments included insults hurled at @entity112 and @entity113 alike			0
attacking both sides : @entity25 called president @entity116 's close advisor @entity115 a ' vacuous cipher ' ( left ) and @entity112 @entity119 ' white trash ( right ) ' so when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of @entity119 and the rest of her white trash family ? what utter useless garbage , ' he tweeted last october about the former @entity112 vice presidential nominee			2
before @entity93 's first trouble with @entity3 that ended his @entity129 career , and before @entity96 was appointed as the @entity99 ambassador to the @entity100 , he took aim at their love choices			0
' was @entity91 wearing beer goggles the night she met @entity93 ? almost as bad a pairing as @entity96 and @entity97 , ' @ @entity25 tweeted in 2011			0
there were serious comments about political connections as well - rather than petty personal jabs			0
' i 'm a fan of @entity116 , but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a vacuous cipher like @entity115 concerns me , ' he said of the president 's longtime friend and advisor			0
' more people should be asking why @entity150 installed two former aides , both with zero foreign policy experience , into top posts at @entity155 , ' he also wrote .			0

@entity1 is a director of non-proliferation *section* of the @entity158 at the @entity10
he admitted to being the *author* of the blistering @ @entity16 account
now he is believed to be connected to a second parody account called @ @entity29 which frequently posted about hiring escorts
@entity1 is married to a *staffer* in the @entity67
