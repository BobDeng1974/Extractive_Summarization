the link between the two cases was confirmed just days after police found a tuft of blonde hair a mile away from where 10 - year - old @entity4 's body was discovered			1
but @entity29 police investigating the murder initially dismissed claims that the hair was a definite clue in the case			2

' @entity4 was last seen beginning a short walk from her home to @entity254 on the morning of october 5			1
