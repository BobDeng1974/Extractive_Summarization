@entity1 's audience shot up by more than half a million viewers on his second week filling in at @entity4 's ' @entity3 ' for the suspended @entity5			1
then again , his rivals fared just as well			0
@entity4 's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers last week , roughly 600,000 more than the week before , the @entity8 company said			1
but on a busy news week with many viewers shut in by the cold , @entity13 gained about the same number of viewers and the @entity16 shot up by 900,000			1
manning the ship : @entity1 has helped @entity4 hold on to its primetime news lead in his two weeks behind the desk as a stand - in for @entity5 the result is evidence that ' @entity3 ' did not take a big hit , at least initially , because of the suspension of @entity5 for six months for misrepresenting his experiences covering the @entity26 in 2003			1
@entity3 had about a 400,000 edge in viewers over ' @entity13			1
' however , that 400,000 - viewer advantage over @entity13 is smaller than the average 587,000 - viewer edge by @entity4 for the season that began last september			1
@entity1 , 55 , has been with @entity32 since 2000 and before that worked as a news anchor in @entity35 for 14 years			0
besides being @entity5 ' chief sub for the past two years , he co-anchors @entity4 , @entity37 and @entity3 on the weekends			1
he 's been placed in a uniquely awkward position , asked to right the ship for a company desperate to get out of the headlines , not knowing whether it 's a temporary position or one that could become permanent			2
and if @entity5 does not return , what can - or should - @entity1 do to prove he 's the right person for the job ? @entity47 for the job ? @entity1 has been @entity5 ' stand - in for years			1
@entity1 is choosing to keep his head down and do the job , not speaking publicly about his role and it remains unclear if the 55 - year - old broadcast veteran has his eyes on @entity5 ' job			1
nor is it clear if that job is even on the table ' it 's tough , ' said veteran news executive @entity58 , once @entity1 's boss when he was @entity60 president			2
' he has to be very careful , because until @entity5 's future is outlined very clearly , @entity1 is just doing the network a favor in a way			1
' he called @entity65 a wise choice for the role			0
@entity1 has unassailable credentials , works hard and does the job without drawing attention to himself , @entity68 said			0
' what @entity4 needs is quiet competence , and @entity1 has that in abundance , ' @entity68 said			2
' @entity1 is someone everybody can be proud of			0
he is somebody the people of @entity32 can be proud of and rally behind , because that 's what they need right now			0
' @entity1 is choosing to keep his head down and do the job , not speaking publicly about his role			0
he 's an accomplished bass guitar player , but he 's not going on entertainment programs to show his chops or swap stories about the news business			0
frequent appearances on talk shows led to trouble for @entity5 , and @entity4 knows that it 's no time to display how entertaining their news anchor is			1
suspended : @entity5 , here with his @entity92 star daughter @entity91 , was suspended from the network after it was revealed he 'd lied about his experiences during the @entity97 war in 2003 ' i never believed the anchorman should be the know - it - all , ' @entity1 said in a 2003 interview with the @entity101			1
' and i try to communicate that to the audience			0
while i have some knowledge from my years of experience , what i want to do is walk you through this because we 're all walking through this together			0
' when the @entity26 started last decade , @entity60 similarly worked @entity1 hard , often giving him anchor shifts during the day and in the evening , and having him appear on ' today ' in the morning			2
there 's no indication @entity1 has lusted after @entity5 ' job			1
they 're the same age and , until two weeks ago , @entity5 was about as secure as you can get in the broadcast business , armed with a long - term contract and atop the ratings			1
but there 's also no indication @entity1 wo n't work to take advantage of an opportunity			2
@entity4 will be watching closely to see how the @entity127 - anchored broadcast holds up in the ratings			2
@entity4 has won 282 straight weeks in the ratings , @entity129 said			2
but reliance on ratings is tricky			0
suppose @entity4 sinks - would it be because viewers did n't like @entity1 , or because they were angry at @entity4 because of what @entity5 did ? or angry at @entity4 because of how @entity5 was treated ? @entity1 's lack of flashiness may be just what @entity4 needs now , but that 's something that could be a handicap when executives are choosing the person who would essentially be the face of the network news division			1
executives often feel they need stars in that role , the @entity148 , @entity149 or @entity150 of the world			0
@entity153 's recent success replacing @entity154 at ' @entity13 ' shows the desire for big names may be overrated			2
while people like @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 have filled in , and @entity162 was a co-anchor at @entity163 more than 30 years ago , a black journalist has never been a sole anchor on one of the three network evening newscasts			0
there will be interest in whether @entity1 has the chance to be the first			0
' i 'm not ascribing motives , ' said @entity172 , a former @entity173 journalist now at the @entity174			0
' i 'm just saying that it has n't happened			0

@entity4 's newscast averaged 10.1 million viewers last week , roughly 600,000 more than the week before
however , @entity4 's 400,000 - viewer advantage over @entity13 is smaller than the average 587,000 - viewer edge by @entity4 for the season
@entity5 was suspended for six months for misrepresenting his experiences covering the @entity26 in 2003
