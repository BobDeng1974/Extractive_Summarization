as the financial crisis hit in 2008 , she spoke for the nation when she asked a group of economists : ‘ why did nobody notice ? ’ four years on , the @entity6 finally got her answer – although it did n’t seem much to her liking			2
the monarch was visiting the @entity10 in @entity11 yesterday when she was buttonholed by one of its financial policy experts			1
scroll down to watch golden look : her majesty examines the stacks of gold bars stored in the @entity10 's vaults royal inspection : the @entity6 and the @entity22 were shown the vaults at the @entity10 where thousands of gold bars are kept @entity24 said he wanted to put her mind at rest after she famously described the credit crunch as ‘ awful ’ during a visit to the @entity29 in 2008			1
at the time , she asked academics how the onset of the crisis could have been missed when it was so enormous			2
yesterday mr @entity33 told her that it was partly because financial crises , like flu pandemics and earthquakes , are hard to predict			2
people , she was also informed , got complacent because they thought the risk was being managed better than before			2
the @entity6 grimaced at this and said : ‘ but people had got a bit ... lax , had they ? ’ usually , she is notoriously discreet about her views on international events			1
but , remarkably , the @entity6 went on to suggest that the @entity45 may not have been aggressive enough in its policing			1
she said : ‘ the @entity45 – what do they call themselves , the regulators – @entity45 , which was really quite new … it did n’t have any teeth			1
’ hands - on : the queen thoroughly inspects the gold vaults during her visit to the @entity10 value : the vaults contain thousands of bars of gold worth billions of pounds the @entity22 did n’t help matters much , asking : ‘ there ’s not another one coming , is there ? he then fixed mr @entity24 and his group with a typically gimlet eye and barked : ‘ do n’t do it again ! ’ afterwards mr @entity24 was optimistic as he assessed the encounter , saying : ‘ it was a real pleasure to be able to offer some explanation			1
i think she recognised that these things are very difficult and it ’s not a straightforward exercise			2
‘ the strongest thing i got [ from the @entity6 ] is what are we trying to do so it does n’t happen again			2
’ the @entity45 , which is being disbanded after failing to spot the financial crisis which engulfed @entity80 , later issued a stiff response to the @entity6 ’s remarks			1
it said : ‘ we ’ve widely acknowledged that the regulatory approach before the financial crisis in 2008 was flawed and has since been completely changed			0
’ it was the @entity6 ’s ninth visit to the @entity10			1
on her first , as the 11 - year - old princess @entity86 , she signed a thousand pound note			0
interesting discussion : the queen was taken with the discussion on how another downturn could be prevented , while the @entity22 joked with the @entity10 's staff reason why : the @entity6 spoke to @entity24 who explained why the financial crisis was n't foreseen during yesterday ’s visit , she and prince @entity96 were each given the honour of each signing a £ 1million banknote , known as a ‘ giant ’ by staff			1
as she scribbled her signature next to the 1937 note , she muttered : ‘ it has n’t improved , really			0
’ on their tour , the @entity6 must have been a little over-awed by the £ 27billion worth that glittered in the @entity10 ’s basement vault			1
visit : a large crowd had gathered outside the @entity10 as the royal couple toured inside , which included an inspection of bank notes it ’s one of nine vaults dotted around @entity115 , in which the bank stores around £ 200billion of gold			1
this one contains 63,000 gold bars stacked in eight rows			0
each four - tonne stack is four pallets high , and each pallet carries 80 bars			0
while , at 13kg – around 2st – a gold bar is a little heavy to steal , the @entity22 did seem tempted by the £ 1million banknote he was asked to sign			0
he joked ‘ is this just lying about ? ’ , adding ‘ you wo n’t miss it , will you ? ’			0
signature : the @entity6 and the @entity22 each signed a £ 1 million bank note to go into the guest book afterwards the @entity135 , sir @entity136 , thanked the @entity6 for her visit , describing the @entity10 ’s staff as ‘ unsung heroes ’ who had kept the economy going ‘ in the most difficult circumstances ’			1
and he asked the @entity6 for two early @entity144 presents			0
one was her signature on the banknote , and the other was the @entity148 on the @entity149			0
‘ when is the @entity150 due ? ’ the @entity6 asked			0
‘ it has gone through @entity153 and should be with you before @entity144 , ’ sir @entity136 replied			0
sweet view : @entity156 , @entity157 views a gingerbread model village on the @entity6 @entity160 cruise ship at @entity162 docks			0

@entity164 suggested @entity45 watchdog ' did not have teeth '
queen asks about economic crash and says : ' people got lax , did n't they ? '
prince @entity172 then tells @entity10 staff : ' do n't do it again ! '
