activists : members of the @entity2 have asked for jazz hands rather than clapping in case it caused anxiety young student union activists have asked other conference delegates to wave with ' jazz hands ' instead of clapping or cheering speakers in case it ' triggers anxiety ' among nervous members			1
hundreds were asked to wave in silence because other people found ' whooping ' to be ' super inaccessible '			1
the request was made at the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , which started yesterday			2
@entity2 women 's campaign tweeted : ' whooping is fun for some , but can be super inaccessible for others , so please try not to whoop ! jazz hands work just as well			1
' they then followed that with : ' some delegates are requesting that we move to jazz hands rather than clapping , as it 's triggering anxiety			2
please be mindful ! # nuswomen15 '			0

@ @entity49 tweeted : ' open palms can be triggering			0
well , so can closed ones ... you should just ban any outward expression of approval			0
' the suggestions got more ridiculous and ironic with @ @entity56 : ' @ nuswomcam @ little - @entity60 hi , jazz hands can be triggering because of the quick movement of the hands			0
i vote blinking rapidly instead			0
despite the jokes the @entity2 has said that it is important that they are inclusive			2
@entity67 , general secretary at the @entity68 , said : ' jazz hands are used throughout @entity2 in place of clapping as a way to show appreciation of someone 's point without interrupting or causing disturbance , as it can create anxiety			1
' i 'm relatively new to this and it did feel odd at first , but once you 've used jazz hands a couple of times it becomes a genuinely nice way to show solidarity with a point and it does add to creating a more inclusive atmosphere			0
' practical example : this woman shows how jazz hands should be done - but @entity2 delegates were urged not to make any noise doing it @entity68 women 's officer @entity95 added : ' as someone who is new to the @entity2 conference culture it surprised me at first , but actually within a few rounds of jazz hands applause it began to make a lot of sense , as loud clapping and whooping can be intimidating and distracting when you 're speaking on stage			1
' plus who does n't like jazz hands ? ! ' the annual event decides the female issues for the @entity2 to campaign on , and elects the campaign 's representatives			2
an @entity2 spokesperson said : ' the request was made by some delegates attending the conference			1
' we strive to make @entity2 events accessible and enjoyable for all , so each request is considered			0
