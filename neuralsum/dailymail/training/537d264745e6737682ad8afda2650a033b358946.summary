the @entity0 has thrown a hitch into president @entity3 's new health care law by blocking a requirement that some religion - affiliated organizations provide health insurance that includes birth control			1
justice @entity8 late on tuesday night decided to block implementation of the contraceptive coverage requirement , only hours before portions of the law would have gone into effect on @entity14			1
her decision , which came after federal court filings by @entity18 - affiliated groups from around the nation in hopes of delaying the requirements , throws a part of the president 's signature law into temporary disarray			1
@entity28 - born @entity27 @entity0 justice @entity8 , who started the countdown clock for the @entity31 's ball , temporarily blocked a key @entity33 provision tuesday at least one federal appeals court agreed with @entity8 , issuing its own stay against part of the @entity33 , also known as @entity33			1
@entity8 acted on a request from an organization of @entity18 nuns in @entity40 , the @entity41 for the @entity42			2
its request for an emergency stay had been denied earlier in the day by a federal appeals court			0
the government is ' temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the @entity33 , ' @entity8 said in the order			1
@entity8 , who was in @entity51 on tuesday night to lead the final 60 - second countdown and push the ceremonial button to signal the descent of the @entity56 ball , gave government officials until 10am est friday to respond to her order			1
a decision on whether to make the temporary injunction permanent or dissolve it likely wo n't be made before then			1
' the government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people , ' lawyer @entity62 said			2
' it does n't need to force nuns to participate			0
' under the health care law , most health insurance plans have to cover all @entity73 - approved contraceptives as preventive care for women			1
that means the coverage is provided free of charge			0
churches and other houses of worship are exempt from the birth control requirement , but affiliated institutions that serve the general public are not			2
that includes charitable organizations , universities and hospitals			0
the requirement prompted an outcry from religious groups , which led the administration to try to craft a compromise			2
under that compromise , insurers or health plan administrators must provide birth control coverage , and the religious institution itself is not responsible			1
but the administration 's compromise did not satisfy some critics , who called it a fig leaf			2
the @entity0 is likely to take up the birth control mandate later this year the nuns would have to sign a form authorizing their insurance company to provide contraceptive coverage , which would still violate their beliefs , @entity62 said			1
' without an emergency injunction , mother @entity111 has to decide between two courses of action : ( a ) sign and submit a self - certification form , thereby violating her religious beliefs ; or ( b ) refuse to sign the form and pay ruinous fines , ' @entity62 said			2
the @entity120 did not comment on the order tuesday night			0
the little sisters operate homes for the elderly poor in the @entity27 and around the world			0
they were joined in their lawsuit by religious health benefit providers , @entity131 and @entity130			0
@entity8 's decision to delay the contraceptive portion of the law was joined by the @entity135 , which also issued an emergency stay for @entity18 - affiliated groups challenging the contraceptive provision , including the @entity140 of @entity141 , and @entity142			1
but one judge on the three - judge panel that made the decision , judge @entity146 , said he would have denied their motion			0
' because i believe that appellants are unlikely to prevail on their claim that the challenged provision imposes a '' substantial burden '' under the @entity154 , i would deny their application for an injunction pending appeal , ' @entity146 said			0
the archdiocese praised the appeals court 's action in a statement			0
' this action by the @entity135 is in line with the rulings of courts all across the country which have held that the @entity169 mandate imposes a substantial and impermissible burden on the free exercise of religion , ' the archdiocese said			0
' these decisions also vindicate the pledge of the @entity27 catholic bishops to stand united in resolute defense of the first and most sacred freedom - religious liberty			0
' the @entity0 already has decided to rule on whether businesses may use religious objections to escape a requirement to cover birth control for employees			1
that case , which involves @entity184 , an @entity187 - based arts and crafts chain with 13,000 full - time employees , is expected to be argued in march and decided by summer .			0

justice @entity8 *granted* temporary injunction allowing @entity18 groups to not cover birth control
new @entity33 regulation was set to take effect on @entity14
decision is a blow to president @entity3 's health care law and could foreshadow @entity0 decision later in 2014
government must respond to injunction by friday
