by @entity0 published : 07:42 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 08:29 est , 6 february 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 would be proud			2
inspired by the hit cartoon films , this contraption can produce your breakfast in one minute , and it 's just in time for @entity7			1
commissioned by the happy egg co. , the aptly - named ' @entity8 ' took a team of four design engineers more than 200 hours to construct and a further 100 to test			1
the device will go on display at the @entity14 later this month and uses a wide selection of household objects including an old - style gramophone and an electric whisk and features a luxury nest throne for the hen to lay her egg in			1
@entity23 - special ! inventors have designed a contraption that @entity1 and @entity2 would be proud of which turns freshly laid eggs into pancakes in a matter of minutes the happy hen , sitting on her throne , lays her eggs , which then roll down the chute towards the pancake - making part of the apparatus the pancake - making process starts with the hen laying an egg in her five - star nest			1
the egg drops down from the throne and rolls down the wooden chute			2
reaching the bottom of the chute , the egg pushes a wooden spoon , which winds up a gramophone			1
when the music starts , the egg is dropped into a holder on the spinning record , then swung around and cracked into a bowl containing other pancake ingredients			1
the egg , laid just seconds before , is poised above a fearsome - looking blade before being cracked and dropped into the bowl and mixed into the batter when the music starts , the egg is dropped into a holder on the spinning record , then swung around and cracked into a bowl containing other pancake ingredients			1
the bowl moves down a conveyor belt where the mixture is whisked and then released slowly into a hot pan			2
the pancake is cooked for 30 seconds , flipped and placed on a plate			1
the machine may look like it was invented by @entity1 but another similar egg contraption appeared in children 's classic @entity68			1
@entity7 takes its name from being shriven , or forgiven of all your sins			0
it is the day before @entity74 , when the sombre season of @entity76 begins			0
splash ! the batter is tipped into the waiting frying pan as @entity76 is a time of fasting , it became traditional to use up rich food - milk , butter and eggs - before switching to the more austere diet deemed appropriate in the period of fasting ahead of @entity86			1
the bowl moves down a conveyor belt where the mixture is whisked and then released slowly into a hot pan			0
the pancake is cooked for 30 seconds , flipped and placed on a plate			1
here 's how to make the perfect pancake if you do n't have a pancake - omatic at home			1
make the batter by mixing 4oz plain flour with two eggs , 7fl oz of milk diluted with 3fl oz of water , a pinch of salt and 2oz of butter			0
sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl			0
make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it			0
gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture , still whisking			0
whisk until all the liquid has been added and the batter has the consistency of thin cream			0
melt the butter in a pan			0
spoon two tablespoons of it into the batter and whisk it in			0
use the rest of the butter to grease the frying pan before you make each pancake			1
get the pan really hot , then turn the heat down to medium			0
@entity133 tbsp of the batter into the hot pan all in one go			0
tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter			0
after about half a minute , and when the bottom is golden in colour , flip the pancake over			2
the other side will only need a few seconds to cook			0
slide the pancake out of the pan on to a plate			2
@entity7 takes its name from being shriven , or forgiven of all your sins			0
it is the day before @entity74 , when the sombre season of @entity76 begins			0
as @entity76 is a time of fasting , it became traditional to use up rich food - milk , butter and eggs - before switching to the more austere diet deemed appropriate ahead of @entity86			2
one of the best recipes for using up those rich foods is pancakes , and so the tradition was born			0
in other countries @entity7 is known as ' @entity7 ' - or fat tuesday - and is marked by carnivals , a final chance to let your hair down before the solemn season of @entity76			2
@entity168 of the happy egg co. said : ' @entity7 is a much - loved tradition so we wanted to do something that would celebrate this annual festivity - and champion the role our hens play in making pancakes			2
' hen happiness is at the heart of everything we do - because happy hens lay tasty eggs - so our contraption is the ultimate for pancake lovers wanting to enjoy a truly fresh pancake			1
' @entity186 , design engineer of @entity188 design production , said : ' it 's no mean feat to create a machine that will break an egg let alone flip a pancake so this project has been a really exciting challenge for the team			1
' we hope we 've cracked it and our machine encourages others to make their very own egg - inspired inventions			2
' the inspiration ? before the pancake - omatic was @entity1 and @entity2 's @entity203 shelling out : @entity204 led the field on breakfast technology with the breakfast - making machine that featured in the film @entity208			1

device took four engineers more than 200 hours to build
wind - up gramophone and electric *blender* are part of the design
