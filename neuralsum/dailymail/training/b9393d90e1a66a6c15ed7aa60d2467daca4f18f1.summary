a prolonged lack of exercise causes the body to become deconditioned it is common knowledge that a sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity , which is a common cause of diabetes , high blood pressure and joint damage			1
however , experts now want to treat lack of exercise as a medical condition in its own right			1
dr @entity15 , from the @entity16 in @entity17 , made the case in the latest edition of @entity20			1
he said those who failed to work out for months such as office workers tied to their desks were damaging their health , whether they were overweight or not			0
prolonged lack of exercise causes the body to become deconditioned causing changes throughout the body			1
the heart rate may rise excessively during physical activity , bones and muscles can waste , blood volume can decline and stamina wane			0
when deconditioned people try to exercise , they may tire quickly and experience dizziness or other discomfort , which makes many give up			2
dr @entity40 said : ' i would argue that physical inactivity is the root cause of many of the common problems that we have			2
' if we were to medicalise it , we could then develop a way , just like we 've done for addiction , cigarettes and other things , to give people treatments , and lifelong treatments , that focus on behavioral modifications and physical activity			0
' then we can take public health measures , like we did for smoking , drunken driving and other things , to limit physical inactivity and promote physical activity			2

dr @entity40 said if physical inactivity were treated as a medical condition itself rather than simply a cause or byproduct of other illnesses , doctors may become more aware of the value of prescribing supported exercise			1
he added that more formal rehabilitation programs that include cognitive and behavioral therapy would develop			0
for those who have been sedentary and are trying to get into exercise , dr. @entity40 advises doing it slowly and progressively			0
' you just do n't jump right back into it and try to train for a marathon , ' he said			0
' start off with achievable goals and do it in small bites			0
' he added that a brisk walk of just 10 minutes three times a day would be a good way of reaching 3hr 30mins of moderate exercise a week .			0
