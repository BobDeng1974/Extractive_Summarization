instead , i have been left with injuries that have had a huge impact on me , both physically and in my career			0
‘ at the time of the accident i was training to be a radiographer and was working hard to reach my goals and start a new career			0
however , all my hard work may be wasted as i no longer have a place at the university and will have to reapply once i recover and am able to attend lectures			0
‘ the injuries have also affected my day - to - day life as i can no longer do simple tasks around the house or walk my dog			0
