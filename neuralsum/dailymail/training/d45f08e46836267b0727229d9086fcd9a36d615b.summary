bells which ring out every day from a 500 - year - old village church could be silenced after a local resident complained they were making too much noise			1
@entity6 in @entity7 , @entity5 has been a part of the market town since 1428			1
but @entity10 , 60 , who lives 300 yards away says , the historic church 's bells are making too much noise , and has lodged a complaint with the local council			1
the bells in @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity5 , have rung out across the market town since 1428 mr @entity10 who recorded the bells ' sound at at 85 decibels , as loud as passing traffic , told the council they are ' destroying his peace and quiet '			1
@entity24 has dispatched environmental health officers with noise measuring equipment to listen for themselves			2
if they act upon mr @entity10 's complaint , church leaders face having to drastically cut down the frequency of the ringing or pay for expensive sound dampening equipment			2
mr @entity10 said : ' pubs , restaurants , cafes and shops have to have a licence to make noise like that			1
' but for some reason church bells seem to be out of the loop - they can do what they like			1
' @entity7 is a beautiful , peaceful town but this is ruining all that ; it is destroying the peace and quiet in @entity7			1
' they make a hell of a lot of noise - they are designed to be heard			1
' mr @entity10 said he has a direct line of sight to the church and has no way of escaping the bells , which ring out three times each week and can be heard for miles			1
he added : ' at the right place and at the right time there 's nothing wrong with it			0
but it is so frequent and so loud			0
' grade i listed @entity6 was built as a small church in 1428 but developed over the years with the addition of new chapels , aisles , a chancel and a tower			1
it is now one of the largest churches in @entity5 with its current bell tower housing eight bells			1
@entity10 lives 300 yards away from the church and has complained its bells are making too much noise reverend @entity79 revealed the church had faced a similar complaint before but he was not aware of the latest investigation			1
he said the majority of people considered the bells a timeless tradition that helps gives @entity7 its special character			1
mr @entity79 said : ' when you go and live somewhere that is near a church the chances are that there are going to be bells rung			1
' there is a church tower and you can see it from the @entity96			2
most people see it as an advantage to hear the bells			2
' the team ring every thursday evening and at 11am and 6pm on sunday			0
they are also chimed on a wednesday , although this is not as loud			0
' people had previously reported the bells to the council 's environmental health officers but they decided that it was within normal ranges			0
' if people have issues with them then i am happy to talk about it but i have not had any complaints			0
' when this issue was raised a few years ago there was a great many letters written in support of the bells			2
' other residents of the market town do not share mr @entity10 's disdain for the bells			2
@entity123 , 70 , who has lived close to the church for 14 years , described the complaint as ' downright silly '			2
she said : ' it 's a lovely part of village life			1
it 's unbelievable that someone would complain about such a lovely thing			0
' a lovely part of village life ' : other local residents do n't share mr @entity10 's opinion of the bells with some saying they contribute to the village 's personality ' everyone i know of who lives close by enjoys the bells			1
they have always been played and i hope they will continue to be played			0
' they 're not any louder than other church bells i 've heard and when i 'm in my house i can only hear them very vaguely			2
i think it 's ludicrous for someone to submit a complaint about this			0
' another resident , @entity153 , 72 , added : ' they 've been played every week since i 've moved here and i 'm very fond of them			0
it 's exactly what you would expect when living close to a church			0
' mr @entity10 's complaint was first raised with @entity162 , who referred him to @entity24 's environmental health department			0
a spokesman for @entity24 said : ' the @entity167 team of the @entity24 's @entity168 investigate complaints of noise from various sources			0
' the main legislation that is used when assessing statutory noise nuisance complaints is the @entity174			0
' there are no set noise limits when determining what a statutory noise nuisance is so trained officers need to determine whether any noise being complained about is an unreasonable interference			0
' many factors are considered when assessing a noise nuisance complaint including the time , duration , frequency and reasonableness of the noise being complained about			0
' each complaint is investigated on its own merits and where it is considered necessary formal action can be taken to ensure that any nuisance is abated			0

@entity6 in @entity7 , @entity5 is over 500 - years - old
its bells are described by residents as ' a part of village life '
@entity200 , 60 , believes the church should be held to the same noise *restrictions* as pubs and restaurants
