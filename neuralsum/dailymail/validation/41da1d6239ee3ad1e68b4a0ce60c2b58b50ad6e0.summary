even the more well - travelled among us would struggle to scratch the surface of @entity3 's @entity2			1
jaw - dropping scenery , ancient monuments and incredible wildlife are just a few of the 1007 sites earmarked for preservation by the organisation			1
but while well - known destinations such as @entity13 and the @entity14 in @entity15 may feature prominently on many intrepid explorers ' ' to do ' list , there are a number of stunning sites that the majority of us will simply never get to see			1
here , we highlight a number of @entity2 that due to conflict , or deterioration , risk being lost to us forever - as well as a few destinations that you may be able to see for yourself ... but only if you 're quick			1
extensive restoration work is needed to preserve the ancient structure , which is at risk from erosion from a nearby riverbed as well as a compromising tilt , similar to the tower at @entity53			1
the 65 meter needle was built in 1194 by @entity32 - od - din , and is covered in intricate geometric brickwork as well as @entity40 inscription in dazzling blue tiles - yet most people will never get to see the @entity35			2
not only is the monument miles away from the nearest human settlement , it lies in a dangerous @entity63 stronghold making travel to the region virtually impossible			0
@entity66 the great mosque and spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city , 80 per cent of which has yet to be excavated the archaelogical city at @entity66 in @entity74 marks the site of a powerful @entity77 capital city that ruled the region for much of the 9th century			2
the @entity79 and soaring spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city , 80 per cent of which have yet to be excavated			2
unfortunately for the rest of the world , this rich cultural landscape is out of bounds			0
the city is located in the @entity66 of @entity74 which remains in the grip of a bitter and ongoing conflict between local militia , @entity92 and @entity94 forces			1
when , and indeed if , the remaining site will be excavated is doubtful			0
ancient city of @entity98 - @entity97 the city of @entity98 was named the ' @entity100 ' , although you wo n't find any tourists there today the @entity104 in the ancient city of @entity98 is at risk due to the ongoing civil war that blights the country @entity97 's rich and glorious cultural heritage is demonstrated by the sheer volume of ancient monuments and historic sites that punctuate this embattled landscape			1
the ancient city of @entity98 contains elaborate mosques , palaces and evidence of a @entity118 street layout , and there are signs of occupation dating back as far at the 10th - century @entity122 hinting at its former glory , the city was even named the ' @entity100 ' , although you wo n't find any tourists there today.the country is in the grip of a bloody and bitter civil war that shows no signs of abating , and the @entity132 advises against all travel to the war - torn country			1
@entity136 of @entity137 : @entity138 and the @entity139 the @entity138 is located within the @entity140 occupied @entity141 , an area that holidaymakers are advised to avoid the alleged birthplace of @entity137 : positioned in the @entity140 occupied @entity141 - an area the @entity132 says is ' currently tense ' six miles south of @entity146 , on the site @entity144 have called the birthplace of @entity137 since the 2nd century , is the @entity138			2
the oldest church in daily use in the world , the original basilica was built in 339 ad , and parts of it survive below ground			0
a cave , over which the first @entity138 was built , is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of @entity137			0
while the site sees streams of religious visitors , its positioning in the @entity158 occupied @entity141 - an area the @entity132 says is ' currently tense ' means it 's not one for the average tourist			2
and even if you do get to it , the church is in danger of crumbling - with the roof structure being vulnerable to lack of maintenance and repair			2
and due to an increase in the number of vehicles , as well as unregulated tourism , pollution now affects its outside walls			2
its preservation relies on the unlikely partnership of the @entity180 government and the @entity181 , so it remains at high risk			1
@entity184 - @entity183 @entity184 was founded in the 5th century and came to prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries when it was a centre for learning desertification has left many of @entity184 's buildings vulnerable , while political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel @entity194 , yet endlessly fascinating , @entity184 has become synonymous with inaccessibility over the centuries			2
once hailed as the intellectual and spiritual capital of @entity77 in @entity199 in the 15th and 16th centuries , today the city remains as distant and increasingly isolated			1
founded in the 5th century , @entity184 was previously a thriving economic and cultural hub in spite of its isolation , and the mosques and holy shrines in the city once played an essential role in the spread of @entity209			2
situated in the gateway to the @entity214 desert , the ancient mosques and libraries of @entity184 are under now at the mercy of the elements			0
climate change and desertification has left many of the buildings vulnerable , and continued political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel			0
@entity223 - @entity222 @entity222 ( right ) is home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas ( left ) - but only around 250 remain the @entity222 covers a vast area of tropical rainforest in the @entity223 that is dominated by two dormant volcanos - @entity231 and @entity232			0
the @entity222 's diverse flora and fauna make it one of the most ecologically rich in the world , let alone @entity199 , and it 's home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas			0
however , despite efforts to preserve the population , only 250 gorillas remain in the park at present , and poaching and political instability in the region have left the @entity222 exposed to worrying levels of destruction			0
the country is virtually off - limits to travellers with the @entity132 guidance advising against all but essential travel to most regions			0
and the endangered sites should visit before they disappear : @entity256 reef the barrier reef in @entity258 is the largest in the @entity74 and @entity259 and is famed for its pristine corals and clear blue water coastal development and tourism also put pressure on the stunning , but fragile , ecosystem , so if you do travel there , be responsible the barrier reef in @entity258 is the largest in the @entity74 and @entity259 and is famed for its pristine corals , crystal - clear waters and white sandy beaches			1
it is also home to the a number of threatened species , including the @entity275 , hawksbill turtles and the @entity278 crocodile			0
however , much like the iconic @entity279 in @entity280 , the future of the reef in @entity258 is under constant threat from a number of factors including climate change , coral bleaching and the frequent hurricanes that blight the region			0
coastal development and tourism have also put pressure on the stunning , but incredibly fragile , ecosystem , so if you do travel there , be a responsible tourist ! @entity297 - @entity296 , @entity298 in its prime during the 15th century , the vast kingdom was the largest earthen city in @entity302 the walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs while @entity13 may be more well - known , the remains of the @entity310 kingdom in @entity297 are just as fascinating			1
the walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs , although the fragile nature of the earthen structures mean the site is slowing - but - surely eroding , so get there soon if you can			1
in its prime during the 15th century , the kingdom was the largest earthen city in @entity318 and the remains of temples , dwellings , irrigation systems and funeral platforms can still be seen today			1
@entity325 - @entity324 today , the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for @entity328 and the its football teams , but its rich mercantile heritage lives on a little closer to home , the city of @entity332 has a rich maritime heritage and was once a thriving commercial port			1
in the 18th and 19th centuries the city played an integral role in the growth the of @entity339 - a legacy that remains to this day			1
during this time , the city pioneered the development of modern dock technology and transport systems , and was a major port for the mass emigration of people to @entity318			0
today , the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for @entity328 and the its football teams , but its rich mercantile heritage lives on , despite the threat of urban sprawl and new developments that are unsympathetic to the vernacular of its historic buildings			0
@entity356 - @entity355 @entity355 is home to countless endangered species - including the @entity358 and the @entity359 ( left ) after years spent in the tourism doldrums , visitor numbers are finally on the increase in @entity356 as the @entity278 country enjoys a period of relative political calm			0
if you are planning a trip , consider a diversion to @entity355 , which is home to countless endangered species - including the @entity358 - as well as incredible flora and fauna			1
situated in the @entity373 of the country , 95 per cent of the park is considered to be in pristine condition , but the threat of pollution , illegal hunting and agricultural sprawl remains an ever - present threat			1
@entity383 - @entity382 rainforests of @entity384 the parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants , around 200 species of mammal - including the @entity392 tiger this once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years due to illegal logging , among other things the tropical rainforests in @entity384 comprises three national parks : @entity399 , @entity400 and @entity401			2
collectively , the parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants , around 200 species of mammal - including the @entity392 tiger - and around 580 species of birds , making it an ideal destination for animal lovers			0
but this once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years			0
the spread of illegal logging , encroaching agriculture and poaching have devastated some parts of the rainforest and still pose a significant threat .			0

there are 1007 incredible sites on the @entity2
many sites are inaccessible due to conflict while other are simply hard to reach
the @entity29 in @entity30 and the ancient city of @entity98 in @entity97 risk being lost forever
you can still see the remains of the @entity296 in @entity297 - if you 're quick
