dame @entity0 is one of our classiest actresses , best known for her portrayal of @entity4 , both on stage and screen			1
but when it comes to food , her tastes are rather less than regal			2
‘ my favourite dish in the world is fried egg and chips , cooked in a special way by a particular restaurant in @entity17 , ’ she says			1
‘ i might struggle to cook it myself , though — my talents in the kitchen are strictly limited			0
my signature dish is baked beans on toast			2
actually , i make even better cheese on toast			0
or @entity26 on toast , and marmalade on toast			0
i ’m a dab hand with a toaster			0
‘ we do tally with our love of food — regardless of what it is or where it came from , ’ @entity0 insists			1
that said , it ’s hard to imagine the fictional @entity41 getting too excited about 69 - year - old @entity0 ’s ‘ favourite dish in the world ’			1
‘ it ’s from a restaurant in @entity57 that cooks the chips in suet , then breaks an egg over the top of them , that then cooks over the hot chips			1
trust me , it is truly delicious			0
’ if this is an attempt to be seen as a woman of the people , rather than as @entity70 ’s best - known movie actress , it ’s not @entity0 ’s only one			1
an oscar - winner with @entity4 eight years ago , she insists she is nothing more than a jobbing actress — happy to hitch from film to film rather than pose for the paparazzi on the red carpet and be feted wherever she goes			1
‘ i ’m not a movie star , i ’ve never thought of myself as that , ’ she says			2
‘ sure i won an @entity80 but i got very , very lucky			0
and i was n’t even a blip on the @entity82 ’ radar until i was well into my 40s			0
‘ it ’s very important to me that i ’m not seen as a star , especially one readily associated with one role or one type of role			1
i fought very hard to wriggle free of my role as @entity92 in @entity92 because i did n’t want to be limited in the parts i was offered			0
‘ i ’m always trying to escape from something , and i ’m currently trying to see my way clear of my @entity96			0
but it ’s easier said than done when you ’ve appeared as her majesty on film and in the @entity102			1
’ especially as @entity0 won an @entity103 for her stage performance as the @entity4 in the @entity105 last year , and will reprise the role on @entity107 this autumn			1
‘ i suspect taking the part to @entity109 may be the final nail in my coffin as far as trying to escape from @entity96 is concerned ! ’ she says			0
‘ i used to think that if i had n’t been forgotten by the time i died , my obituary would read : “ actress who played tv cop @entity92 , and who used to take her clothes off , has died			2
” ‘ now , it would probably read : “ actress who played the @entity4 , and who used to take her clothes off , has died			1
” but that ’s fine , as long as i still have the freedom to play a variety of other parts			2
’ dame @entity0 has certainly varied the mix since her @entity80 triumph			1
the roll - call includes two movies with @entity128 — an adaptation of @entity131 ’s @entity130 and a remake of the comedy @entity134 — the @entity135 , in which she voiced the frightening @entity136 ; tv film @entity137 , when she was lawyer @entity145 ; spy movie @entity140 , playing a former secret agent ; and the big - screen thrillers @entity143 , @entity144 : @entity146 , and @entity147			1
the story follows @entity149 ( @entity150 ) and his family who move from @entity152 to a village in the @entity37 where they open a restaurant and encounter @entity41 ( played by @entity0 , right ) @entity156 describes @entity40 as a ' charming story ' and said it meant she could spend a couple of months in the @entity37 her latest film , @entity40 , was very much a choice from the heart , as it meant she could spend a couple of months in the @entity37 and take part in what she calls a ‘ charming story ’			1
‘ it was also about getting a classic phone call when i was offered the film			2
i was told , “ it ’s @entity170 on the line			2
” he is one of the producers , and i did think somebody was having me on , but it really was @entity170 , and i quickly said yes			0
‘ and , of course , there was the food			0
@entity40 is a food movie , whether it ’s the @entity36 - starred dishes prepared by @entity41 ’s establishment or the wonderful @entity152 fare in the restaurant 100ft across the road in the small town where the movie ’s set			1
’ she adds : ‘ when i appeared in @entity188 , the thief , his wife and her lover , which also had a strong culinary element , the off - set catering for the cast and crew was terrible ! i think they ’d blown all the budget on the food you saw on screen , and everyone was reduced to eating @entity202 for lunch			1
‘ there was none of that on @entity40			1
the @entity208 caterers were excellent , and my co-star , @entity209 , who plays the @entity152 restaurant owner , used to bring in bowls of @entity152 food containing the most delicious snacks			1
’ dame @entity0 at the @entity70 gala screening of @entity40 in @entity217 this week but was n’t she worried about piling on weight ? ‘ some actresses are always on diets and i am no different because you feel you have to be , ’ @entity0 admits			1
‘ i suppose i ’m fortunate in that i do n’t put on huge amounts of weight — and the odd bout of illness where i ’m off my food soon takes off the pounds			0
‘ i have about 10lb that seem to come and go from my body — i should give each one of them a name because they ’ve become so familiar to me — and that ’s been the way of things for as long as i can remember			2
maybe i should do something about them — finally say goodbye to them			0
giving up those two spoonfuls of sugar in my coffee might help ! but food is surely something to be celebrated , something to be enjoyed			0
’ it ’s certainly celebrated in @entity40 , a comedy - drama that follows the intense rivalry between the two restaurants			1
dame @entity0 says : ‘ i seriously recommend that people do n’t eat before they see it , so they salivate over all the gorgeous food — especially in the @entity152 restaurant — and then have the appetite for the most delicious meal later			1
‘ is n’t it interesting how we @entity254 have taken to @entity152 food , how it ’s become such a key part of what we eat ? it ’s the first meal my husband @entity260 [ @entity261 , the @entity82 film director ] and i have when we get back to @entity217 from abroad			1
‘ and the one food i really miss when i ’m abroad is not fish and chips but a really good @entity152 meal			2
’ @entity0 will be able to sample the real deal for the first time when she travels to @entity152 in december to visit a literary festival			1
the trip dovetails with work on her next movie , woman in gold — about a @entity274 refugee seeking justice for what happened to her family in @entity278 as for next year , @entity0 has various projects under consideration			1
not that the fear of unemployment ever leaves her , she admits			0
‘ i say to @entity260 : “ it will come to an end , you know , we all have finite careers			0
” ‘ my aim is to carry on working , and enjoying that work , for as long as i possibly can			0
and if each project is as enjoyable to work on as @entity40 , i shall be more than happy			2
’ @entity291 : the live sessions the vogue for vintage gathers pace with this sparkling debut by close harmony trio the @entity298			0
backed by a slick , upbeat ensemble , the vivacious group hark back to @entity301 on a series of swinging @entity303 , @entity304 and @entity305 covers from the 1930s and 1940s			0
@entity303 ’s @entity307 and a spirited @entity308 are energised by snapping fingers and a jazzy trumpet			2

@entity321 , once called ‘ @entity82 ’s greatest living poet ’ by @entity323 , still plays the silky romantic well , but his singing partners are erratic			2
@entity326 adds little of note to get ready , but @entity328 whips up a storm on the way you do ( the things you do )			0
@entity333 shines on being with you			0
