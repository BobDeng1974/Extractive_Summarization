@entity2 , 32 , was caught red handed as he returned to collect a card reader from an atm he had tampered with			1

@entity17 , of @entity18 and @entity20 police @entity19 , said @entity2 was part of a well - organised criminal enterprise			1
‘ you can tell from the quality of the equipment that was attached to the @entity11 , you can tell from the amount of detail that was found on the computer , ’ he said			2
‘ this was well organised , well orchestrated and with good criminal connections			1
’ @entity2 used a highly sophisticated card reader which fitted over the entry slot of atm machines			1
users would unwittingly pass their card through the device , which would record the details stamped on it			2
a tiny pinhole camera would then film the victim entering their pin			2
mr @entity17 said : ‘ it fits over the card slot on an atm and as the card goes in it will read your details off the card			2
‘ the camera will see you put your pin in			2
it will see your finger strokes and it will know which card it goes with			2
’ @entity2 's device included a tiny hidden pinhole camera which would film each person 's pin number , after he was arrested police found the details of 9,000 bank cards on his home computer officers reviewed @entity62 footage and spotted @entity2 fitting the device to the atm			1
he was arrested when he returned later in the day to retrieve it			0
mr @entity17 added : ‘ by irony , or total coincidence , the guy was coming back , we think , to remove the device			0
the arresting constable had already seen the cctv of him fitting it earlier in the day , recognised the person and he was arrested			0
’ @entity2 , a @entity6 national living in @entity74 , @entity20 , pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and the possession of various skimming devices in a hearing at @entity80			1
he was on the run from another police force over similar offences when he was caught			1
judge @entity85 remanded him in custody and said all options would be open for sentencing			0
police estimate that banks lose on average £ 460 per card in such skimming frauds			1
police were called to a cash machine outside a @entity94 store in @entity95 , @entity20 , after customers reported their suspicions about the device			1
the tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated , varied and widely used			0
skimming is just one type of this fraud , it is when a card ’s magnetic stripe data is electronically copied by a criminal			1
fraudsters skim cards using a device that is fitted to a cash machine or to a chip and pin machine in shops or stores			0
this data is then transferred onto a fake magnetic stripe card and used overseas in countries that have not yet rolled out chip and pin			0
the number of counterfeit card fraud losses ( which includes those perpetrated by skimming ) on @entity126 - issued cards in the @entity126 has actually fallen in the last two years , according to @entity127			1
in 2010 , this type of crime was worth £ 47.6million , but in 2011 it had dropped to £ 36.1million			0
this drop has been attributed to the increased number of foreign countries who have introduced chip and pin technology , which makes it much harder to use fake @entity126 cards overseas			1
the tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated , varied and widely used			0
here is how they have developed : spring traps : once a card has been inserted , these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the atm from retracting it			0
cash traps : claw - like implements are inserted into cash - dispensing slot to ' capture or skim some of the dispensed bills '			1
@entity154 : an oversized fork - like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal @entity11 transaction			1
skimmers : thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers			0
the data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at @entity11 along with victim ’s pin to withdraw cash			0
