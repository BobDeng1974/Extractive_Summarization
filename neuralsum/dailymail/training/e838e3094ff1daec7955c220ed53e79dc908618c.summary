a meteor streaking though the night sky above the @entity2 has been captured on camera			1
the fireball , which was filmed off the coast of @entity6 in @entity7 by a webcam , appears to burn up in the sky before disappearing			1
the footage was spotted by the operators of a live webcam set up beside a section of railway line in @entity6			1
the blazing fireball footage was captured at around 1am last wednesday			1
it flares brightly above @entity17 , just off the caost of @entity7 , for a few seconds before vanishing close to the horizon			0

he said that he often checks the camera to watch night - time repairs being carried out on the railway track after it was damaged in storms last year			0
mr @entity35 , who lives in @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' the camera has a night time mode and i just happened to be looking at it when i saw this bright light move across the sky			1
' i was n't really sure what i saw so i asked @entity55 who runs the camera to send me the footage so i could have another look			2
' we are not really sure what it is , but it looks like it could be a meteor			2
' after the footage was posted on the webcam 's @entity68 page , other residents in @entity7 began reporting seeing similar things			1
@entity71 said that his mother in law and daughter saw the fireball from @entity76 in @entity7			2
@entity77 from @entity78 also said she saw the meteor			2
officials at the @entity82 @entity81 said they had not received any reports of meteor sightings in the area			2
the nearby @entity86 in @entity87 said it was currently looking through its sensors to see if it had detected the meteor			2
the camera overlooking @entity38 , @entity7 captured the fireball in the sky on the right of the image above the daytime view from the webcam above shows that the meteor appeared somewhere above the channel experts have said the fireball is likely to be a meteor a few inches across that broke apart in the atmosphere some have suggested the fireball may have been a sunlight flare reflected from the panels of an @entity110 satellite			1
however , as the course of these satellites is well known , such flares can be reliably predicted and none were expected to occur above the @entity82 on that date			0
dr @entity116 , public astronomer at the @entity117 , said : ' it certainly looks like a meteor to me – it brightens erratically and seems to expand and contract in the close - up shots as if it ’s breaking apart			0
' a ‘ flare ’ of reflected sunlight from an @entity110 satellite would brighten smoothly and look more symmetrical			0
' the other possibility i considered was a ship ’s distress flare , but the speed and trajectory seem wrong for that			0
' this kind of bright meteor or " fireball " is not particularly rare but , as the video shows , they ’re quite brief and so often go unnoticed			1
' to me it looks like the object either disappears behind a bank of clouds near the horizon or just disintegrates in mid-air			0
the erratic flaring of the fireball above as it traveled across the sky makes it likely that it was a meteor the fireball flares up brightly for a few seconds before disappearing close to the horizon over @entity17 ' a meteor this bright is probably a few centimetres to a few tens of centimetres across			1
' from the video it ’s hard to say whether any of it survived to fall into the sea or whether it just burnt up completely in the atmosphere			0
' the day before the video , residents in @entity163 also reported seeing a fireball in the sky			0
last june a large green fireball was spotted passing over the @entity82 and was caught on camera by the @entity86 in @entity7			1
on that occasion the bolide meteor was reported to have broken into several pieces as it entered the @entity174 's atmosphere			1
dr @entity116 added : ' the spread of cheap @entity178 recording in recent years means that many more of them are now being picked up - which is useful for scientists , both because they can get a better idea of their actual frequency and because the meteor ’s trajectory and apparent speed can give valuable information about where it came from			0
' the weekend was also due to be the peak for the @entity190 meteor shower , although these are supposed to be only visible in the southern hemisphere			0
the next major meteor shower due to be visible in the @entity194 will be the lyrids that will peak on 22 april shortly before dawn .			0

@entity198 filmed the fireball as it broke apart in atmosphere
the meteor was spotted on live footage by webcam operator @entity35
experts say the meteor may have been a few cm to a few inches in size
it is thought to have broken apart in the atmosphere , causing it to flare
