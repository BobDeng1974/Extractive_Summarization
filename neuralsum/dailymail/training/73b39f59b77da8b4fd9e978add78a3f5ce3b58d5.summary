flown to a new life ? @entity2 's official state newspaper claims disgraced @entity4 president @entity3 has been smuggled out of the country by the @entity6 @entity2 today claimed that the @entity6 could be behind the disappearance of toppled @entity4 president @entity3			1
the official newspaper of @entity11 's government alleged that @entity13 intelligence may have secretly flown the disgraced tyrant - now accused of mass murder - to a new life after giving him personal guarantees if he left the political stage			1
the extraordinary claim in @entity21 will inevitably be seen as a smokescreen for similar suspicions that @entity2 is now shielding former ally @entity3 , possibly at the headquarters of the @entity25 in @entity26			1
but today 's theory from @entity29 's official newspaper that the @entity6 may be behind his disappearance is the most intriguing yet in a ' where 's @entity3 ? ' hunt that has gripped governments and the media since the weekend revolution in @entity37			1
' where is @entity3 ? ' asked an article on the website of @entity2 's state - owned newspaper of record			1
' the intelligence agencies of many countries , hundreds of politicians and experts , thousands of interested persons in @entity37 , and millions of @entity4 racked their brains over this question			0
' he could not have simply disappeared into thin air			0
he is a recognisable politician , after all , even a very recognisable one			0
' and at this point , the entirely logical question comes to mind : has he not been hidden by people who are very adept at covering tracks ? that is to say , by the @entity13			2
' the article stated that ' many people thought it strange how easily @entity3 raised the white flag and signed an agreement that obviously no - one apart from himself intended to fulfil ' after the involvement of the foreign ministers of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
the @entity66 newspaper claimed that ' it was obvious that the main ' guarantors ' of this document were not @entity71 diplomats , but their counterparts from across the @entity73			0
' @entity3 would definitely have continued to resist if he had not received sufficiently weighty guarantees of safety for himself , his family , and his innermost circle , ' stated the @entity2 version			1
making ties : former @entity4 prime minister @entity84 ( who is no longer using the wheelchair she was in when she left prison ) shakes hands with @entity13 deputy secretary of state @entity86 in @entity37 documents recovered from @entity3 's presidential home that reportedly show evidence of widespread corruption have started to appear online			1
journalists and volunteers have been analysing the papers after divers retrieved them from the lake at the sprawling estate in @entity97			2
they say the documents show how millions was lavished on construction , furnitures and animals			0
@entity103 , one of the journalists , told @entity104 : ' some documents were collected from the surface of the water , others were retrieved by the divers ...			0
we had to unfold and dry them immediately to preserve the information			0
' the papers are being uploaded to the purpose - built website @entity114			2
journalist @entity115 said : ' these documents are very valuable			0
they could help prove corruption schemes used by @entity3 personally , his team and his inner circle			2
' ' who could give such guarantees in the prevailing situation in @entity4 ? only @entity124 , which , as the latest events in @entity37 show , is the ' eminence grise ' behind the @entity128 ( @entity4 protests )			1
' it has been claimed by participants in the talks that @entity3 abruptly agreed to the agreement last week after consulting various people privately on the phone , including @entity11			1
@entity3 packed his bags the same night in his vast mansion near @entity37 , evidently not intending to return			2
the paper claimed that the @entity13 may have learned from other revolutions where the bloody fate of the toppled tyrant became a spectacle			2
' it is possible to understand the @entity13			2
they needed not @entity3 , but @entity4			2
' at the same time , @entity124 is clearly not interested in a repetition of the bloody reprisal against @entity146 leader @entity145 in a @entity71 state			0
' in other words , the @entity148 could have given @entity3 any safety guarantees , so long as he disappeared from the @entity4 political stage			1
' and the @entity13 are past masters at disappearing people			0
take the episode of the @entity6 's flying prisons alone			0
' the newspaper also denied reports that the @entity2 which have major military facilities in @entity160 - close to the last alleged sighting of on - the - run @entity3 in @entity158 - was now in @entity29 's hands			1
' @entity3 is not in the facilities or ships of the @entity2 @entity25 , ' stated @entity21 citing an ' informed military source '			1
opulent : a view of a room inside president @entity3 's palatial estate in @entity171 religious iconography and paintings displayed in a room inside the estate which the tyrant fled from last week grand : a staircase winds up inside the palatial property , which has been closed off to the world for a decade ' reports had appeared in certain @entity4 mass media outlets to the effect that the @entity4 president was allegedly in @entity185 in @entity160 , where the @entity25 's marine brigade is based			1
' information appeared to the effect that @entity3 was in @entity189			0
but he was not found there either			0
' perhaps he has fled in the direction of the @entity192 ? this report was immediately refuted by the authorities of the @entity196 states			0
in hiding : @entity3 fled on saturday as the turmoil of three months confrontation with his people caught up with him lived in luxury : a view of a bathroom inside president @entity3 's @entity171 estate @entity4 have poured in by their thousands onto the 140 - hectare grounds for a first glimpse at a luxury ' according to unconfirmed information , the @entity4 president has even given up his personal state guard			1
there is no doubt that , if this is true , it is far easier to disappear without a guard than with one			0
' so just where is @entity3 ? in @entity37 , he has even been placed on the wanted list			0
' it can not be ruled out , however , that the thugs who have seized power in the @entity4 capital simply need to inquire about the whereabouts of the disappeared president from the @entity13 ambassador , who is becoming an ever more important figure on the political @entity225 of " independent " @entity4			2
' however , it is unlikely that he will tell them the truth			0
' ' not in @entity29 's hands ' : a @entity2 army officer helps an armored personnel carrier drive on a street in @entity160 , close to the last alleged sighting of on - the - run @entity3 in @entity158 women holding flowers pass by barricades in @entity37 's @entity239 , the epicenter of the country 's current unrest , @entity4 caught on camera : @entity245 footage captured what appears to be the deposed leader wheeling a suitcase into a helicopter over the weekend fugitive on the run : former @entity4 president jumped into this helicopter en route to @entity255 airport , but was unable to fly out of the country			1
