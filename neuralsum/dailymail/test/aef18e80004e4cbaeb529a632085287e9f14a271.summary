it was a gruesome death that is the stuff of most people 's nightmares			0
now scientists have identified the unfortunate individual whose bones were found fused to the walls of a cave in @entity8 , near @entity9 , in southern @entity10			1
using analysis of dna extracted from the bones sticking out from the limestone rock , researchers have found he was a @entity17 who fell down a sinkhole around 150,000 years ago			1
over the thousands of years that followed , the body decayed and the remaining bones gradually became incorporated into the stalactites left behind by water dribbling down the cave walls			1
the dna is the oldest to ever be extracted from a @entity17 and the researchers now hope to further analyse the genetic information from the skeleton			1
they have a reputation as rather brutish creatures who chomped their way through huge hunks of meat , but it seems @entity17 may actually have been the first masterchefs			2
new research is suggesting that these extinct early humans may have used wild herbs to flavour their food			0
scientists have found traces of compounds found in camomile and yarrow in the hardened plaque of 50,000 year old @entity17 teeth found in @entity58 , @entity59			1
at first researchers thought they might have been using these plants as a form of self - medication , but now new findings have presented a different theory			0
dr @entity66 , a lecturer at the @entity68 in @entity69 , and her colleagues suggests they may have used them to make food more palatable			0
first discovered in 1993 , the skeleton - nicknamed ' @entity22 ' - has provoked debate among anthropologists partly due to the difficulties in studying the skeleton as it had become part of the cave walls			1
examination of those bones that were exposed suggested they belonged to an adult male			0
however , few could agree on whether the skeleton belonged to a @entity17 or a modern human , or how long it had been down there			2
but after taking a tiny part of the skeleton 's shoulder bone , researchers at the @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 have been able to answer the questions			0
they found mitochondrial dna they extracted from the shoulder bone matched that of other @entity17 skeletons			1
uranium - thorium dating techniques has also revealed that the skeleton appeared there between 172,000 and 130,000 years ago , during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity106 , one of the palaeoanthropologists leading the study from the @entity88 , said : ' @entity22 is an incredible treasure for the @entity111 territory			2
' we hope that this fossil skeleton will become a key for a virtuous combination of scientific research , protection of our heritage and its promotion and development			0
' researchers have , up until now , held off from excavating the remains ( above ) as they believed it would cause irreparable damage to the skeleton but an early studies had suggested it had some @entity17 features the @entity130 cave where the uniquely preserved @entity17 skeleton was found is close to @entity9 , @entity10 neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies the researchers now hope that further analysis of the dna might reveal new insights into @entity17 evolution			1
it is nearly 100,000 years older than other previously sequenced @entity17 dna			1
the @entity141 is thought to have come to rest in its unusual tomb after an adult male fell down a sinkhole into a limestone karst system			0
wedged in the narrow rocks , he were unable to move and probably starved to death			0
however , it also means no predators were able to reach his body			0
over time , his bones fell where had died , with some still lodged in the cave gap and were eventually absorbed into the walls of the cave itself			2
@entity160 explorers then stumbled across the bones in 1993			0
researchers eventually obtained permission to take a fragment of the shoulder bone in 2009 and have spent six years studying it			2
writing in the @entity168 , the research team said : ' even though a number of @entity17 traits can be seen — particularly in the face and in the occipital bone — there are features that distinguish this specimen from the more typical morphology of , such as the shape of the brow ridges , the relative dimension of the mastoids , and the general architecture of the cranial vault			2
' overall , our results concur in indicating that it belongs to @entity17 , with some phenetic peculiarities that appear consistent with a chronology ranging from 172 ± 15 ka to 130.1 ± 1.9 ka			2
' thus , the skeleton from @entity9 represents the most ancient @entity17 from which endogenous dna has ever been extracted			1
' it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient @entity17			1
but the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes			0
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning @entity201 now have roughly two per cent @entity17 dna			1
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history			0
however , some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases			0
scientists have found that part of our @entity217 system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from @entity17			1
other researchers have suggested that humans outside @entity223 are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with @entity17			1
researchers from @entity227 and @entity228 universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the neanderthal genome			0
if they manage to sequence the dna , they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the @entity17			1
it could also help shed new light on their relationship with modern humans analysis of other @entity17 dna has shown they interbred with our own species			1
recent research has shown that @entity17 suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off			2
they have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis , typhoid , whooping cough , encephalitis and the common cold			0
but anthropologists from @entity262 and @entity263 say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of @entity17 .			2

@entity22 was discovered in a cave in @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10
researchers say the body has been in the cave for 128,000 to 187,000 years
scientists have extracted dna that has *confirmed* bones are @entity17
they say @entity202 might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids
