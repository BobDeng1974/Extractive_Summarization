by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 10 december 2013 updated : 10:06 est , 10 december 2013 what an ingenius way to put a very special smile on a cancer patient 's face			2
in its latest project , a cancer foundation based in @entity6 has tried to get 20 people to experience the feeling of being ' carefree ' after being diagnosed with the disease - and captured that moment on camera			1
the idea was inspired by a patient who told the foundation , ' you know what i miss the most ? being carefree '			1
so to make that happen , staff invited 20 patients to a photo studio for what they told them was a free makeover from a team of professional hair and makeup stylists			1
@entity29 got a shock when she saw what the stylists had done to her - given her dreads being carefree : @entity34 could n't stop laughing after seeing her @entity36 makeover but there was a condition : they had to keep their eyes closed the entire time			1
the stylists then got to work - giving them a completely outlandish look they would never have expected			2
and when the 20 patients opened their eyes , a photographer captured their shock and surprise through a one - way mirror			1
some looked horrified at first , while others broke into laughter straight away			2
but all of them enjoyed it in the end			0
the project , named if only for a @entity57 , was created by the @entity36 , an organisation dedicated to ' the improvement of the quality of life of people affected by cancer '			1
president and founder @entity64 said : ' learning that one is struck by cancer is terrifying			0
' an operation is always difficult and painful , the following treatments often long and hard			0
the impact of the disease is different for everyone but still has significant consequences on the patient 's life and that of her environment			0
before and after : cancer patient @entity78 's first reaction after being given an extreme makeover whoa : @entity81 gave this smirk after seeing what the stylists had done to her surprise : @entity86 opened her eyes to see this - a very pink makeover ' i 've had difficult times			1
but i was lucky enough to be surrounded by all those who meant something to me			0
' a nice wig and a caring beautician made me feel like i was still a full - fledged woman despite the obvious effects of the disease			0
' the support of a psychologist helped me to stay strong throughout my fight			0
@entity101 before and after : this cancer patient looked overjoyed at her makeover hair - raising : cancer sufferer @entity105 was given this mullet - makeover the project , named if only for a @entity57 , was created by the @entity36 , which produced this book ' the attention from nurses and doctors , brightly decorated oncology centers have made the chemotherapy sessions less stressful			1
' the testimonies of people in recovery showed me that i could win the fight and look at the future more positively			2
' from that experience i adopted the belief that cancer must be attacked on all fronts , not just medically			2
and the desire to offer to all those who face this disease , the possibility to be supported , helped and comforted			0
' for everyone to live through the cancer " better " , to take on the challenge with greater confidence			0
