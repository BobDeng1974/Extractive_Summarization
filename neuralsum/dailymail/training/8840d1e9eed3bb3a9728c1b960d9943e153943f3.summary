the former @entity10 governor thanked chat show host @entity3 for inviting her on his ' shambolic show ' but added she was ' kind of busy right now '			1
the @entity5 message , which had been liked by nearly 3,000 of @entity0 's supporters within two hours of it being posted , is part of an online spat between the pair after @entity3 poked fun at her intellect			0
thanks but no thanks : @entity0 used this picture of her with a bear she shot to send a message to @entity3 earlier in the week the host of @entity26 tweeted ' and she 's back ' and linked to a satirical article from the @entity28 claiming @entity0 believed @entity29 had celebrated @entity30			1
