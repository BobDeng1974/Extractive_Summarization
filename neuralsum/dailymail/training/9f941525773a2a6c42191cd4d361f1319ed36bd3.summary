sir @entity0 was far from the circling media helicopters and the indignity of a police raid yesterday			1
as his lavish apartment in @entity5 in @entity6 was searched , he was in @entity7 where he had been staying at his magnificent cream - painted villa			2
he always stays at the estate on the @entity11 from the end of the @entity13 in july until the grapes ripen at the end of september			2
there is a vineyard near the house and he takes great pride in his award - winning wine			2
the singer , now 73 , thinks of @entity7 as his sanctuary			1
he sees almost no one when he is there – certainly none of his many showbusiness friends – and enjoys the peace of his manicured garden with its rows of pleasingly symmetrical cypresses , tended by his gardener			2
he said later that he had seriously considered asking the tennis star to marry him his £ 3million @entity11 farm and his £ 6million plantation - style villa in @entity40 are his pride and joy			1
he spends more time there than he does at the apartment that was raided yesterday , which he bought in 2008			2
he shrugged recently that he spends ' a week here , a week there ' in @entity46 and it has been revealed that he is not even a @entity46 resident any longer as he spends so little time in the country			2
he is domiciled instead in @entity40 , where he spends each winter			2
that 's not to say that he has n't taken care over his home in @entity5			1
it is , like everything else in his life , very beautiful and done to his own particular tastes			2
as he was spending more and more time abroad , he decided in 2006 that he should move from his large home of three decades in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , to somewhere far smaller and requiring less upkeep			2
the former @entity63 where sir @entity0 owns a £ 3m apartment that was raided by police yesterday @entity68 place in @entity69 , @entity40 , where the prime minister @entity70 and his family have stayed sir @entity0 's @entity73 home on the @entity11 in @entity7 where he produces award - winning wines estate agents were told that he wanted somewhere ' opulent , secure and convenient '			1
at first he moved into an ugly yellow - brick bungalow on the @entity77 , where his neighbours included entertainer @entity79			2
but that was a temporary move , and he soon settled in the @entity82 building in @entity5 , the @entity83 of @entity63 diamonds , now converted into luxury apartments			2
@entity0 's £ 3million apartment is in the spectacular art deco mansion complex with its @entity89 stone columns and tall bronze - framed windows			1
the main house was built in 1938 by @entity92 , a millionaire from @entity93 who had made his fortune in electrical motors			0
after the war it served as the headquarters for @entity63 , before becoming a jumble of offices and factory units , until it was taken over by developer who converted it and two other buildings into apartments			0
the apartments all have marble floors and walls clad in walnut panelling			0
the kitchens are oak and chrome and the bathrooms granite , with heated floors			0
huge plasma televisions are hidden behind mirrors			0
there is a spa , gym , tennis courts and a swimming pool			1
first love : the singer himself has acknowledged @entity126 , the wife of his @entity128 bandmate @entity127 , as the only woman he has ever shared a bed with sir @entity0 has had little cause to be displeased , except for a complaint that the gardens were not properly maintained at one time			1
he was spotted with a party of 11 friends and family at his local @entity140 restaurant , @entity141 , in @entity5 , celebrating his 70th birthday in 2010			0
it was a typically down to earth choice for the singer , who is known for being cautious about money – except , perhaps , when it comes to property			1
@entity149 of @entity150 , who sold the apartment to sir @entity0 , said at the time : ' about 85 per cent of our buyers have a second property abroad and are decanting from bigger houses in the area for something less onerous to run			1
' love affairs : at 22 , sir @entity0 had a passionate affair with actress @entity161 , then 24 , ( left ) and has said that he came close to marrying @entity36 ( right ) in the 1980s in an interview with the @entity163 in 2011 , sir @entity0 explained that despite the ' @entity164 of @entity166 ' image , he had been prompted to change his life as he was getting older and taking life a little easier			1
he said : ' it 's a matter of having more time to myself and enjoying a more comfortable life			1
for instance , i used to take just three weeks ' holiday a year			0
' now i go to @entity7 for a couple of months to enjoy my farmhouse and vineyards there			0
i spend another couple of months at my house in @entity40 , where the view over the @entity181 is to die for			0
' he has said that he will sell his @entity40 home , where @entity70 and @entity184 have holidayed as guests , when he is 75 and move to a place with less demanding upkeep			0
companion : sir @entity0 has described former roman catholic priest @entity189 ( left ) as a ' companion ' and a ' blessing '			1
mr @entity189 manages the singer 's property portfolio he also has a home in @entity195			1
all his properties are managed by a former @entity198 priest , @entity189 , who has lived with him ever since his manager , @entity197 , who shared his home for 30 years , moved out			0
sir @entity0 said : ' i ca n't stand travelling alone , eating alone , or being on my own			1
when @entity197 and i lived together , there was always speculation about our relationship , but nobody realised his girlfriend was living with us , too			1
they just thought , ' uh-oh , two guys living together			0
' when @entity197 moved out , it was just because he and his girlfriend wanted to be alone together			0
' in 1993 , he had told a @entity212 special : ' if you 're not married it does n't mean you 're gay			0
i 'm happy , i 'm settled but i 'm not married			0
' sir @entity0 has had a handful of serious romances since losing his virginity at 18 to @entity126 – who married @entity127 , bass player in his backing band @entity128			1
a biography said she was the only woman he has ever slept with			0
he said later : ' i loved @entity126 and there was a mutual physical attraction			0
she looked like @entity224 , who i had a thing about at the time			0
it turned out to be nothing very much at all and i made a big mistake			0
' after a romance with @entity236 dancer @entity235 in 1961 , there a fling with actress @entity161 and a liaison with dancer @entity233			1
the relationship with miss @entity161 began on the set of his 1964 film @entity241			1
their brief romance was not revealed until two decades later , when both insisted it had amounted to nothing more than kissing , cuddling and holding hands			0
she said he was ' very important in my life and a very close friend ever since , ' and he said : ' we loved each other madly , we had a romantic attachment , but it was n't a sordid affair			2
' most famously there was @entity0 's romance in the @entity260 with tennis player @entity36			1
in 2008 he told an interviewer : ' i seriously contemplated asking her to marry me , but in the end i realised that i did n't love her quite enough to commit the rest of my life to her			0
' now , all that is in the past and sir @entity0 , worth £ 40million after more than 50 years in the business and 16 no 1 hits , has finally started slowing down – even though , to some extent , he remains financially anxious			1
' i 've never lost that basic human need to feel secure , ' he said			2
' i still wake up sometimes in a cold sweat , wondering if i 've got enough			0
' his financial anxiety may partly be the result of his humble beginnings			0
he was born @entity0 in @entity276 , outside @entity277 , in 1940			1
his parents came to @entity279 in 1948 , and were described as destitute at first			0
@entity0 and his sisters , @entity281 and @entity282 and @entity283 , lived in a single room in @entity285 , @entity286 , while his father sought work			1
sir @entity0 has devoted his working life to finding homes where he is truly secure			1
after the events of yesterday , that security and comfort must suddenly feel a little precarious			0
