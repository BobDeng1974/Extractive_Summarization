by @entity0 it is the most distant cosmic magnifying glass ever found			2
astronomers using @entity4 's @entity3 have unexpectedly discovered a monster elliptical galaxy so large it has created a lens allowing researcher to see back 9.6 billion years			2
the monster elliptical galaxy breaks the previous record holder by 200 million years			2
these @entity3 images reveal the most distant cosmic lens yet found			0
the giant elliptical is the red object in the enlarged view at left			0
its red color comes from the light from older stars			1
in the enlarged view , the lighter - colored blobs at upper right and lower left are the distorted and magnified shapes of a more distant spiral galaxy behind the foreground elliptical			0
these ' lensing ' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends , magnifies , and distorts light from objects behind them , a phenomenon called gravitational lensing			1
team members @entity35 and @entity37 of @entity38 ( @entity38 ) in @entity39 , @entity40 , used the gravitational lensing from the chance alignment to measure the giant galaxy 's total mass , including the amount of dark matter , by gauging the intensity of its lensing effects on the background galaxy 's light			1
the giant foreground galaxy weighs 180 billion times more than our @entity53 and is a massive galaxy for its epoch			1
these ' lensing ' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends , magnifies , and distorts light from objects behind them , a phenomenon called gravitational lensing			1
the object behind the cosmic lens is a tiny spiral galaxy undergoing a rapid burst of star formation			0
its light has taken 10.7 billion years to arrive here			1
seeing this chance alignment at such a great distance from @entity71 is a rare find			1
locating more of these distant lensing galaxies will offer insight into how young galaxies in the early universe built themselves up into the massive dark - matter - dominated galaxies of today			1
dark matter can not be seen , but it accounts for the bulk of the universe 's matter			0
' when you look more than 9 billion years ago in the early universe , you do n't expect to find this type of galaxy - galaxy lensing at all , ' explained lead researcher @entity86 of @entity87 in @entity88			0
' it 's very difficult to see an alignment between two galaxies in the early universe			1
' imagine holding a magnifying glass close to you and then moving it much farther away			0
' when you look through a magnifying glass held at arm 's length , the chances that you will see an enlarged object are high			0
' but if you move the magnifying glass across the room , your chances of seeing the magnifying glass nearly perfectly aligned with another object beyond it diminishes			0
' ' there are hundreds of lens galaxies that we know about , but almost all of them are relatively nearby , in cosmic terms , ' said @entity35 and @entity37 of @entity38 ( @entity38 ) in @entity39			1
' to find a lens as far away as this one is a very special discovery because we can learn about the dark - matter content of galaxies in the distant past			1
' by comparing our analysis of this lens galaxy to the more nearby lenses , we can start to understand how that dark - matter content has evolved over time			0
' the ' clean ' version of the image , showing the surrounding area			0
although the elliptical galaxy is hefty , it is not as massive as many of today 's galaxies			1
our @entity131 galaxy , for example , is three to four times more massive than the elliptical galaxy			2
although the elliptical galaxy is hefty , it is not as massive as many of today 's galaxies			1
our @entity131 galaxy , for example , is three to four times more massive than the elliptical galaxy			2
most of the @entity131 's mass is locked up in dark matter			0
the lensing galaxy , however , is underweight in terms of its dark - matter content			0
' the unusually small amount of dark matter in this massive , elliptical , lensing galaxy is very surprising , ' @entity37 said			2
' other elliptical galaxies that are closer to us have much more dark matter and have inventories of stars that appear to be different from this super-distant lensing galaxy			2
' the team 's results appeared in the july 10 issue of @entity158 .			0

' @entity161 ' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends , magnifies , and distorts light from objects behind them
seeing chance alignment at such a great distance from @entity71 is rare
