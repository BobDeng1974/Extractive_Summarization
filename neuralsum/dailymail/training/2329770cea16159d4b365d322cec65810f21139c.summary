by @entity1 reporter @entity3 's deputies who showed up at @entity5 's doorstep last month to check on his mental health had n't seen online videos in which he threatens suicide and violence even though those recordings were what prompted his parents to call authorities			1
the officers also failed to check his apartment - something @entity5 later revealed came as a huge relief because they might have found the cache of weapons he went on to use in the massacre			1
upon arriving at the apartment , the 22 - year - old simply dismissed the situation as a misunderstanding and the officers left , noting that @entity5 was ' polite and timid '			1
by the time law enforcement did see the videos , it was too late - the well - mannered , if shy , young man that officers concluded after their visit posed no risk had gone on a deadly rampage			2
sheriff @entity49 has defended the officers ' actions , but the case highlights the challenges that police face in assessing the mental health of adults , particularly those with no history of violent breakdowns , institutionalisations or serious crimes			1
' obviously , looking back on this , it 's a very tragic situation and we certainly wish that we could turn the clock back and maybe change some things , ' @entity49 told @entity67 ' ' @entity66 ' on sunday			2
' at the time deputies interacted with him , he was able to convince them that he was ok , ' he said			0
it 's not clear why the deputies did not become aware of the videos			2
attorney @entity72 said the @entity5 family had called police after being alarmed by @entity76 videos ' regarding suicide and the killing of people ' that their son had been posting			1
a picture of one of @entity5 's victims stands in a makeshift memorial in front of the @entity87 where he was killed a woman places flowers on the lawn of the @entity93 sorority house where @entity5 shot three women nearby students gathered for a candlelight vigil on the @entity97 to remember those killed during @entity5 's massacre two students comfort each other during a candlelight vigil held to honor the victims of the shooting @entity105 , executive director of the @entity107 - based @entity106 , said @entity109 law has provisions that permit emergency psychiatric evaluations of individuals who pose a serious threat , but that was never triggered			1
@entity5 's family has disclosed their son was under the care of therapists			1
' once again , we are grieving over deaths and devastation caused by a young man who was sending up red flags for danger that failed to produce intervention in time to avert tragedy , ' @entity105 said in a statement			0
' in this case , the red flags were so big the killer 's parents had called police ... and yet the system failed , ' she said			1
@entity134 , 22 , was shot dead by @entity5 during his shooting spree through @entity136 @entity5 , writing in a manifesto , said the police asked whether he had suicidal thoughts and he was able to convince them he was fine			1
he said he was relieved his apartment was n't searched because deputies would have uncovered the cache of weapons he used in the rampage in @entity146			0
he said he opened the door to his apartment talking to a group of sheriff 's deputies , terrified they 'd take him to jail before he could carry out his murderous plans			2
' i had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what i was planning to do , and reported me for it , ' @entity5 wrote near the end of a 137 - page biographical manifesto			1
' if that was the case , the police would have searched my room , found all of my guns and weapons , along with my writings about what i plan to do with them			2
' he posted at least 22 @entity76 videos			2
@entity172 , 19 , was also gunned down by @entity5 after he allegedly failed to break into a sorority house he wrote in his manifesto that he uploaded most of his videos in the week leading up to april 26 , when he originally planned to carry out his attacks			1
he postponed his plan after catching a cold			0
' on the week leading up to date i set for the @entity180 , i uploaded several videos onto @entity76 in order to express my views and feelings to the world , though i do n't plan on uploading my ultimate video until minutes before the attack , because on that video i will talk about exactly why i 'm doing this , ' @entity5 wrote			1
in the final video posted friday , he sits in a black @entity191 in sunset light and appears to be acting out scripted lines and planned laughs			2
' i 'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you , ' the son of a @entity197 director who worked on @entity198 says			0
in his videos and writings , @entity5 voices his contempt for everyone from his roommates to the human race , reserving special hate for two groups : the women he says kept him a virgin for all of his 22 years and the men they chose instead			1
at least two other people who saw @entity5 's videos before friday compared him to a serial killer , through a message board on a bodybuilding website and the social network @entity219			1
the rampage played out largely as he sketched it in public postings			0
he said he would start by ' silently killing as many people as i can around @entity146 by luring them into my apartment through some form of trickery			0
' he said he would knock them out with a hammer , and slit their throats			0
on sunday , the sheriff 's office identified the final victims as @entity234 , 20 , and @entity235 , 19 - both from @entity237 - and @entity238 , 20 , of @entity239			0
@entity234 and @entity235 were listed on the lease as @entity5 's roommates			2
investigators were trying to determine whether @entity238 was a roommate or was visiting the apartment			0
around 9.30pm , the shooting rampage began and lasted about 10 minutes			0
in the end , he shot and killed three others at random and injured 13 more either with gunshots or the @entity191 that he used as a battering ram against bicyclists and skateboarders			0
deputies found three semi-automatic handguns along with 400 unspent rounds in the car			2
it was a series of social media posts referencing suicide and murder that triggered their concerns , according to family spokesman @entity72			1
upon arriving at @entity5 's apartment , authorities said he dismissed the situation as a misunderstanding and claimed he had no intention of hurting himself or anyone else			1
he was timid , ' @entity49 said			2
his behavior also failed to ' meet the criteria for an involuntary hold			0
' @entity272 , 21 , from left , @entity274 , 22 , and @entity275 , 20 , stop in front of a makeshift memorial at the @entity93 sorority house where two women were killed as part of friday night 's mass shooting @entity5 later wrote that he was terrified the deputies were only moments from discovering his plans			1
' if they had demanded to search my room ... ( t ) hat would have ended everything , ' he wrote			0
' for a few horrible seconds i thought it was all over			0
' from then on , he kept at least one gun and a few loaded magazines near him at all times so that if police did return he could shoot at them and get away			0
' thankfully , all suspicion of me was dropped after i took down the videos from @entity76 , and the police never came back , ' he wrote			1
' it was all because of the videos			0
i must have expressed too much anger in them , ' he added			0
' i immediately took most of them off of @entity76 , and planned to re-upload them a few days before the @entity180			0

@entity5 wrote that he was terrified police would derail his homicidal plot
authorities were sent to his residence when family members told local mental health services they were concerned
police left without searching when they found the *cooperative* @entity5 ' timid '
@entity5 had posted videos online *fantasising* about murder and suicide
online posters who saw videos had compared @entity5 to a serial killer
