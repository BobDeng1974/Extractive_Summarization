@entity6 joined the @entity9 in 2002 and one of her jobs was escorting @entity2 before she married the 39 - year - old is now suing the @entity9 for race discrimination and wrongful dismissal for the way it handled her case , with her previous claims of racism not forming part of her own misconduct hearing , the @entity23 was told			1
she claims that although the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) was aware of the race allegations she had made , these were not put before the police misconduct board			0
ms @entity10 joined the @entity9 in 2002 and one of her duties was escorting @entity2 before she married prince @entity41 and became the @entity2			1
during her career she saved two people 's lives and received two commendations			0
ms @entity10 claims she experienced racism from her police colleagues in 2010 , and also reported that sergeant @entity11 racially harassed her			2
following her allegation an elderly woman came forward and accused @entity10 of fraud			2
this led to what ms @entity10 refers to as her ' malicious arrest ' in april 2013			2
ms @entity10 appeared before a misconduct panel and - despite the @entity56 saying the fraud allegation was untenable and they would not be bringing charges in september 2013 - she was disciplined and sacked last june			1
but in february she was reinstated with full pay after a successful internal appeal against her dismissal			0
@entity62 , representing ms @entity10 , said in his skeleton argument : ' prior to her dismissal , the claimant had complained of racism on several occasions			2
she also claimed that she was being harassed and victimised ... the @entity35 were aware of that allegation			0
' however , the @entity35 failed to put this relevant evidence before the @entity69			0
' he added that ms @entity10 did not raise these claims herself because of ' bad advice ' from the @entity73 , the @entity35 had a ' clear duty ' to do so			2
he said that in light of panel not having any knowledge of the evidence of discrimination , it made the ' wrongful decision ' to dismiss her			0
mr @entity62 said : ' we do say @entity82 is racist and that this sorry saga began when he pressurised a very elderly lady with dementia to make a formal complaint of fraud against the claimant			0
' he added that @entity82 's questioning of the woman , who also imagined that ms @entity10 had had an abortion and that @entity92 had bought her a house , caused her to become ' very upset '			2
ms @entity10 was reinstated in february this year it is not argued that the misconduct panel was prejudicial , but that the wrong decision it made was rendered discriminatory by the racist motivation of the @entity35 and / or @entity82			1
mr @entity62 also drew attention to the employment tribunal of black police officer @entity101 in which the @entity9 admitted it had a written policy to ensure that no discrimination complaint was successful			0
ms @entity104 won Â£ 37,000 in her race and sex discrimination claim			0
however @entity108 , representing the @entity9 , said once the the @entity56 had decided to not take any action against ms @entity10 for the fraud allegations , the matter was dealt with as a disciplinary issue , leading to her dismissal			1
she said ms @entity10 could not have a wrongful dismissal case because she had been reinstated			1
she further argued that the @entity101 could not bring race claims because the panel that dismissed her was protected from discrimination claims by judicial immunity proceedings			0
but mr @entity62 said it would be ' absurd ' if the officer could not bring her discrimination claim because he said ' even the @entity121 has accepted that the decision was wrong and given the importance of tackling discrimination in society and in particular the police			0
' employment judge @entity127 reserved her judgment on whether ms @entity10 can bring a case of wrongful dismissal and race discrimination against the @entity9			1
