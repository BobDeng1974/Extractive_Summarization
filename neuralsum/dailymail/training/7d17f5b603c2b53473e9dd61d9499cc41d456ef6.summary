after holders @entity1 were dumped out of the @entity3 on wednesday , @entity0 may not wish to be alerted to the @entity3 - winning manager 's curse that has developed since february 2007			1
between the 2007 and 2013 competitions , five out of the six managers to win the tournament left their club less than a year later			1
the @entity11 boss should not be feeling the heat just five months after winning the @entity13 , but the list of managers to have lost their jobs so soon after lifting the @entity3 in recent years is a reminder of how quickly things can change in football			0
left by mutual consent in september 2007 ( seven months later )			0
2007 - 08 : @entity26 – won cup with @entity34 in february 2008			2

2012 - 13 : @entity24 – won cup with @entity47 on feb 24 2013			2
sacked on feb 4 2014 ( less than a year later )			0
2013 - 14 : @entity0 – won cup with @entity1 in march 2014			2
back in february 2007 , few could have foreseen that @entity29 , who had just won the @entity3 for the @entity13 champions would be gone just seven months later			1
a year later , @entity26 lifted the trophy for @entity34 after a 2 - 1 win against @entity31 , which was meant to herald a bright new dawn for @entity34			2
eight months on the @entity53 was unceremoniously given the boot after a run of poor results			0
sir @entity35 bucked the trend by winning the tournament in 2009 and 2010 and remaining in his post until 2013 , but since then the curse has continued			1
in 2011 , @entity43 defeated @entity62 in the final but suffered relegation from the @entity13 just three months later			0
the following month , manager @entity41 resigned via email			0
@entity45 legend @entity25 won the @entity67 ' first trophy in six years in 2012 when he managed the team to @entity3 victory after a penalty shoot - out win against @entity71			1
it did n't do him much good – he was sacked less than three months later			0
@entity24 was the manager to lift the @entity3 in february 2013 as he led @entity47 to the first major trophy in the club 's history			1
@entity41 masterminded @entity43 's 2011 @entity3 success but his side were relegated three months afterwards and he resigned @entity29 has been a victim of the curse - he left @entity31 seven months after the 2007 @entity3 win the @entity80 was sacked less than a year after the success			1
@entity0 and @entity1 are still fighting on three fronts , and the @entity11 will not be panicking , but in the unforgiving world of modern football , his team 's results may have to improve quickly if he is to avoid the @entity3 manager 's curse .			0
