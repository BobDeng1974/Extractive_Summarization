by @entity0 @entity1 : 11:13 est , 28 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:53 est , 28 december 2013 life - threatening : @entity3 , 12 , thought he was concussed after knocking his head in a football match			1
but two weeks later , doctors discovered a life - threatening brain disease a 12 - year - old boy who knocked his head during a football match had part of his skull preserved in his stomach as doctors operated on a life - threatening infection in his brain			1
@entity3 thought he was concussed when , two weeks after a match with friends , his headache was only getting worse			1
but half - way through a family holiday in @entity23 , the pain was crippling , his forehead swelled , and his parents rushed him to hospital			1
to their horror , doctors discovered his brain was swelling up with a severe sinus infection			1
@entity3 was rushed into the theatre for an emergency six - hour operation to open his skull and remove the disease			1
and in a bid to avoid any risk of worsening , they kept the severed bone clean by depositing it in his stomach			1
it meant his brain was able to swell without pressurising the skull , which would have rendered him unconscious			0
the bone remained in his stomach for two months before eventually being replaced the day before his 13th birthday			1
his mother , @entity43 , 44 , said : ' it was so scary			0
' we were none the wiser about @entity3 ' condition until we set off on holiday and i noticed his forehead had started to swell up			2
' he had suffered a knock on the head playing football a couple of weeks before , so we thought it might have been related to that			2
' when it began to cover his right eye , giving him ongoing headaches , we visited two hospitals but both indicated it might be mild concussion			0
' it was all such a sudden shock to us			0
one moment we were on holiday , the next our son was being taken into an operating theatre - it was a complete nightmare			0
' @entity3 first developed a temperature and headache while on holiday with his family in @entity23 in august			1
concerned , his parents @entity43 and @entity71 , also 44 , cut the holiday short and returned home			0
for fear of worsening the infection , doctors did not want to replace his skull with titanium after opened it up			1
so they deposited the severed bone in his stomach for two months before putting it back in they took @entity3 to the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 , for a ct scan			1
doctors discovered it was not concussion but a severe sinus infection , which was spreading across his brain and eyes			1
he was immediately taken to nearby @entity92 for surgery			0
@entity3 was suffering from common sinusitis - inflammation of small cavities behind the cheekbone and forehead			1
in most cases it can be cleared with over-the - counter medication or antibiotics			0
we could n't risk the possibility of raised pressure in his skull as it would cause him to become unconscious so we had to remove a section of the skull and put it in the abdomen - @entity109 , neurosurgical nurse but in around one in 10,000 cases , bacteria can spread to the eye , surrounding bone , blood or the brain and prove fatal unless treated quickly			1
the 12 - year - old was showing signs of fever and sepsis as well as swelling of the brain			2
advanced paediatric neurosurgical nurse practitioner @entity109 said : ' when anyone has an infection to the brain it is very serious			0
' the antibiotics must be strong enough to penetrate the blood brain barrier and kill it off			0
' but , in addition to treating @entity3 's infection , we had to contend with the swelling on his brain			1
' we could n't risk the possibility of raised pressure in his skull as it would cause him to become unconscious			0
' therefore , the neurosurgeons had to perform a craniectomy - removal of a section of the skull - to allow his brain to swell without pressurising the skull			2
' they then cut open the stomach , clean up the bone to remove any infection and put it into the subcuaneous abdominal tissue , where the bone is preserved			1
' they have to either do that with the bone or throw it away and replace it with titanium			2
he was on holiday in @entity23 when his parents took him hospital , where he was rushed into six - hour surgery ' replacing it with bone is more preferable and there is less risk of infection			1
' @entity3 had the bone replaced the day before his 13th birthday in november			1
the youngster must now wait for the removed piece of bone and the rest of his skull to completely fuse together			2
but it means no contact sports for the teenager , who plays football and rugby , until the new year			0
@entity43 said : ' he is sports mad and is itching to get back to football again			0
' we just have to keep reminding him that he is n't quite ready yet			0
' but he should be able to join for the new season in september			0
' he ca n't wait			0
' the family have since raised 1,615 pounds for the hospital through fundraising events , including a sponsored football match			0
mrs @entity181 said : ' this has been a real rollercoaster for the family and a very long recovery for @entity3			2
' but he 's doing really well and we are so grateful to the teams at both hospitals for what they did for him			0
' mr @entity190 , a consultant paediatric neurosurgeon at @entity191 , added : ' sinusitis with secondary infection in the brain is a life - threatening condition that requires swift treatment			2
' @entity3 received this swift treatment from a number of specialist teams , including children 's neurosurgery , ear , nose and throat and infectious diseases , and i am delighted he has made such a good recovery			2

@entity3 had a crippling headache two weeks after playing with friends
rushed to hospital with a fever and doctors found severe sinus infection
immediately taken for 6 - hour operation , where skull kept clean in stomach
it is an *alternative* to replacing bone with titanium , which could get infected
