for @entity5 has been accused of basic etiquette errors – by the lady of the house			1
the @entity9 , the mistress of @entity10 where the series is filmed , has criticised the @entity14 drama ’s repeated faux pas			1
among them , says @entity9 – who writes a blog in which she reveals how a stately home should really be run – are the incorrect setting of the table for dinner and the lack of servants			1
‘ glasses are back to front and things are set wrong			0
‘ setting up the table is an art. knives , forks and spoons are set from the outside in , beginning with the bread knife and working through each course to cheese			0
‘ a pat of butter is impressed with the intertwined cs and coronet and placed in front of each guest			0
‘ the wine glasses and water tumbler are arranged to the top right of each setting			0
@entity5 prefer a different arrangement			2
‘ i do n’t want to step on people ’s toes so i ’ve tried a few times to say , “ do you know you ’re setting the table wrong ? ” i do feel , after all , that it ’s my dining table and obviously we would n’t set it like that			0
lady of the manor : @entity64 , 8th countess of @entity65 , writes a blog about her life running @entity10 ‘ they look at me blankly and i sort of try once more and then i give up … and now i try not to look because it ’s easier			1
’ other tips from @entity9 , whose husband the 8th @entity65 owns @entity28 , near @entity71 in @entity72 , include butlers wearing white gloves to keep fingerprints off the glasses			1
she has previously said a stately home of @entity5 ’s size would , in the early 20th century when the programme is set , have had up to 60 domestic staff			1
at the end of the third series , the fictional @entity82 family had only about a dozen servants			2
her observations will delight the small group of @entity5 fans that takes to the internet after each episode to point out anachronisms			2
but @entity9 perhaps can not afford to be too critical of the show – one of the most popular period dramas ever – the fourth series of which begins on @entity14 this month			1
for its success has had a dramatic impact on the lives of those living inside the ‘ real ’ @entity5			2
the fictional @entity102 has struggled to keep hold of his ancestral home and , before @entity5 hit our screens , the @entity65 and @entity9 admitted their estate needed £ 11.75million repairs , including £ 1.8million of urgent work on the main house			1
ravaged by damp and rot , at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and stone turrets were in disrepair			0
but after their friend , the show ’s writer and producer @entity116 , asked if he could film at @entity28 , it has become one of the @entity123 ’s best - known stately homes			0
up to 1,200 visitors a day descend in the summer , enabling the owners to begin major repairs			0
a spokeswoman for @entity128 said : ' the team behind @entity5 applies the highest production values and the programme 's historical advisor is on hand at all times to ensure that all elements of the production - including the set design , costumes and any props used - are as authentic as possible and in keeping with what was considered appropriate at the time			1
' as the drama is a fictional series , the two footmen depicted are representative of a larger number of staff that would have existed at the time			0

@entity5 makes major faux pas at dinner time
countess of @entity65 highly critical of @entity5 's manners
series ' fail to set tables correctly and do *n't* have enough servants '
