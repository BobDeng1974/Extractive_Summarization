consumer magazine which ? said the ban will spell the end of many vacuums its testers rate among the best on sale			1
here are five of @entity40 's most popular vacuum cleaners that will be banned when the new regulations are introduced 1			1
@entity42 ( 2100w ) 2			2
@entity43 ( 2200w ) 3			0
@entity15 3 @entity16 – @entity17 – @entity18 ) 4			0
@entity44 ( 2100w ) 5			0
@entity19 ( 1800w ) ... and four top selling models on @entity47 that will be banned by 2017 1			1
@entity49 @entity48 ( @entity50 ) 2			0
@entity51 2 @entity52 and @entity53 ( @entity54 ) 3			0
@entity56 - @entity55 ( @entity50 ) 4			0
@entity57 ( @entity58 ) of seven models the magazine has rated as a ‘ best buy ’ since january 2013 , five have motors above 1,600 watts			1
the @entity63 said the rules , intended to help tackle climate change by cutting energy usage across @entity67 , will lead to ‘ better vacuum cleaners than ever before ’			1
but @entity69 mep @entity69 claimed the legislation will do nothing to help climate change , with lower - powered vacuums succeeding only in making ‘ life harder for house - proud householders ’			0
the maximum wattage will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017			2
current cleaners have an average of 1,800 watts			1
which ? says : ‘ if you ’re in the market for a powerful vacuum , you should act quickly , before all of the models currently available sell out			2
‘ a best buy 2,200 - watt vac costs around £ 27 a year to run in electricity – only £ 8 more than the best - scoring 1,600 - watt we ’ve tested			2
’ an @entity11 energy label will be introduced , giving vacuum cleaners a to g ratings for energy use , cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors , and dust emissions			1
the label also requires a minimum level of performance for the vacuum to be sold in the @entity11			2
' act quickly ' : which ? has warned consumers that vacuum cleaner models such as the @entity44 ( 2100w ) ( left ) and @entity42 ( 2100w ) will sell out ahead of the new regulations specification : a sample of the label that manufacturers will put on all vacuum cleaners but the scheme is self - regulating , meaning that manufacturers will create their own labels , and which ? said it was unclear if the results would be corroborated by an independent third party			1
sir @entity116 , whose company pioneered ‘ bagless ’ cleaners and campaigned for a cap on wattage , said the eco-labels could be misleading because they did not take account of the cost of ‘ consumables ’ – vacuum bags and filters , which often can not be recycled			1
he said : ' a label should help people choose high performing , energy efficient technology not hide important information			0
' the environmental impact of bags and filters is ignored			0
and the label misleads people by showing the energy scores of vacuum cleaners tested without dust inside			1
' machines should be tested for real world conditions , not just for a @entity144 test lab – that ’s why we ’re taking it to judicial review at the @entity148			0
' @entity69 health spokesman @entity149 said a cut in vacuum motor power may affect those with lung conditions such as asthma , which ‘ can be exacerbated by dust mite allergy ’			1
@entity156 , the @entity63 ’s energy spokesman , says the amount of wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform			1
what counted was how efficiently a vacuum translated its electrical power into picking up dust , which would be measured under the new rules			1
the measures will also be extended to appliances , including water heaters and tumble dryers			0
the @entity169 said : ‘ the industry has been working on designs to meet the requirements , as well as overcome any concerns about how lower power outputs may affect performance			2
’ since the 2010 general election @entity144 has handed down almost 3,600 pieces of new regulation and directives affecting @entity40 businesses			0
last year , @entity11 officials came close to banning olive oil jugs and dipping bowls from restaurants			0
the plan , which would have forced restaurateurs to only serve oil in its original bottles , with tamper - proof lids was withdrawn following extensive opposition			0
there was proposed @entity11 legislation to ban the @entity11 flag , along with flags and signs representing @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 from packs of meat			2
some of the world ’s most popular perfumes - including @entity203 5 - are under threat from planned @entity11 regulations that target perfumiers with ingredient bans and labelling requirements aimed at protecting a tiny fraction of consumers who suffer from allergies			0
in may it emerged that best - before dates on kitchen cupboard items such as tinned goods and olive oil could be scrapped after several @entity11 countries warned that they lead to the waste of million of tons of food a year			0
the @entity11 has also proposed regulations on anchovy fishing in the @entity223 , the labelling of spirits and the use of rosemary extracts in certain low - fat meat and fish products .			0
