by @entity0 @entity2 fan : forever youthful singer @entity3 it may be a favourite among stars such as @entity3 , but @entity2 jabs do not make you better looking , according to new research			1
a study , published in the @entity11 , is the first to look at whether injectable cosmetic procedures – chosen by thousands of @entity13 each year – make women appear healthier , younger and more attractive			1
when shown pictures of ten women who had had @entity2 , 150 volunteers said they now looked marginally less attractive than before			1
however , fillers – gels injected under the skin to add volume – were found to improve appearance			1
@entity2 works by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine , a chemical messenger that tells muscles to contract			1
over time , the nerves rebuild the ability to release the chemical messenger , allowing muscles to regain their function			0
this usually takes several months			0
the research was carried out by @entity35 - based cosmetic surgeon dr @entity34			0
he did not administer the injections himself , so was able to remain impartial			0
he says : ‘ we ’re all aware of people with frozen faces from too many treatments			2
muscle movement around the eye area is incredibly important for expressive empathy			0
‘ in most of the women in the study , the eyebrow level was lower after @entity2 and the under - eye area was saggier			1
' they may have been free from crow ’s feet but they did n’t look as good			0
you wo n’t always see an instant boost to attractiveness from @entity2			2
’ injecting youth : @entity2 works by blocking the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine , a chemical messenger that tells muscles to contract dr @entity34 adds : ‘ facial muscles are interconnected			2
if you freeze one part , you could relax another and cause sagging in that area			0
' @entity2 can change the volume distribution of the face and injecting it into the eye area can make the cheeks droopier			2
’ as we age , we lose volume in our upper face and gain it in the lower face , creating a jowly effect			0
dr @entity34 has noticed that a prime concern for many patients is achieving a jaw line to rival @entity78 stars such as @entity79			0
‘ i still think that @entity2 is great but it has to be used in much smaller doses around the eye and forehead and in much larger amounts in the lower face and neck , ’ dr @entity34 says			1
‘ @entity2 is much better if it is used for shaping the face rather than as a treatment for lines and wrinkles			1

study found that @entity2 made people less attractive
the nerve *poison* is used to ' reverse aging ' by reducing wrinkles
@entity2 is most commonly injected around the eyes and forehead
