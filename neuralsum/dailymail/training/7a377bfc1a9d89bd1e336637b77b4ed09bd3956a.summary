with @entity3 once again in the grip of a defensive crisis , @entity0 could call upon @entity4 as a stopgap in saturday 's @entity7 match with @entity8			1
the midfielder has long been a fall - back for @entity3 at centre - half and , having recovered from an ankle injury suffered in the summer , could make his first appearance under the @entity15 boss			1
@entity3 's most experienced centre - back , @entity17 , limped out of sunday 's defeat to @entity19 with an ankle problem while @entity21 has a hamstring injury and @entity23 is suspended			1
@entity4 could be forced into action at centre - half in this weekend 's game with @entity8 as @entity3 find themselves in the midst of another defensive crisis @entity0 is missing key personnel at the back as @entity3 aim to return to form against the @entity8 @entity17 limped off with an ankle injury during @entity3 's embarrassing 5 - 3 defeat to @entity19 on sunday @entity23 was sent off at @entity19 and will be suspended for saturday 's match at @entity35 @entity4 is , of course , more comfortable in central midfield but has never complained when called upon to slot in at the back			1
his performances in such a role , however , have been somewhat mixed			0
@entity4 was pressed into action in defence when @entity3 played at @entity44 on the opening weekend of the 2012 - 2013 campaign but was bullied by @entity46 , who scored the only goal in a 1 - 0 win			1
but for the heroics of @entity50 , @entity3 could have been on the receiving end of a thrashing as @entity4 struggled to adapt to his role			2
@entity46 , now at @entity3 , towered above him for the winning goal in the second half			0
@entity46 outjumps @entity4 to score @entity44 's winner on the opening weekend of the 2012 - 13 season @entity4 had problems with @entity60 forward @entity59 when @entity3 played @entity60 in the @entity61 and a week later , there were more problems as @entity3 started with @entity4 alongside @entity64 in a 3 - 2 win over @entity66			1
in a @entity61 tie with @entity60 , playing with @entity17 , he was embarrassed by the @entity70 side 's frontline of @entity71 and @entity59 as they took a two - goal lead			2
@entity3 went on to prevail 3 - 2 but their abysmal start exposed an alarming lack of depth at the back			2
the season before , @entity4 played alongside @entity21 in a home match against @entity78 and again struggled as @entity3 fell to a 3 - 2 defeat on sir @entity81 's 70th birthday			1
he was at fault for @entity84 's goal to put @entity78 two goals up and looked shaky all afternoon			0
back in december 2009 , @entity4 was forced to anchor a makeshift back three at @entity66 with @entity87 and @entity88 alongside him			0
@entity4 struggles with @entity66 's @entity89 during a @entity7 meeting in december 2009 all were completely overpowered as @entity66 romped to a 3 - 0 win thanks to goals from @entity89 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
but it 's not all been bad			0
on other occasions , @entity4 has performed well in the defensive position			0
last season , @entity98 asked him to fill in against @entity8 alongside @entity21 and @entity3 kept a clean sheet in a 2 - 0 success			1
in 2011 - 2012 , he played competently alongside @entity17 as @entity3 thrashed @entity102 5 - 0 at @entity35 and back in 2009 , he marshalled a back three of himself , @entity87 and @entity104 in a 3 - 1 @entity61 win over @entity106			1
@entity4 successfully marshalled the @entity3 back line in their 2009 @entity61 win over @entity106 in the summer , former @entity3 favourite @entity109 tweeted that @entity4 would be the ' perfect ' fit as centre - back in @entity112 's 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
but though such a system worked well for @entity114 at the @entity115 , @entity112 has already abandoned it in the @entity7			0
and on the balance of past evidence , even if the manager returned to it , @entity4 would not be the man to play in such a crucial position			0
these are desperate times for @entity3 and @entity112 simply ca n't afford to have @entity4 performing badly at the back			2
@entity3 's emergency defender must stand up and be counted this weekend along with the rest of the back line			0

@entity3 face a defensive crisis ahead of @entity8 match
@entity0 is without @entity17 , @entity21 and @entity23
@entity4 may have to *deputise* at centre - half
@entity138 's previous performances in defence have been mixed
@entity3 need to *bounce* back from *surprise* 5 - 3 defeat at @entity19
