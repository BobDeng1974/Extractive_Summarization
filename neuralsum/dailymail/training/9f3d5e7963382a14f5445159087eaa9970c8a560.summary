@entity1 militants fighting in @entity2 and @entity3 are producing a weekly @entity5 language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would - be jihadists in the @entity7			1
the magazine , which is professionally designed and edited , is published by @entity16 - the propaganda wing of @entity18 , the @entity14 militant group whose brutal campaign to establish an @entity11 state in the @entity12 has been branded too extreme even by @entity19			1
@entity18 already make extensive use of social media to keep in near - constant contact with supporters in the @entity7 - even selling branded merchandise such as t - shirts , baseball caps and cuddly toys			1
it is put out once a week , with four editions already released in june @entity18 ' weekly magazine is titled ' the @entity30 ' and is published every seven days			1
now on it 's fourth edition , the first was printed on june 1			0
a fifth edition is expected to be released on saturday			0
the fourth edition features a slick front page with the headline ' smashing the borders of the @entity41 : the @entity42 ' , and has a photo of masked militants freely crossing the border between @entity3 and @entity2			0
all of @entity2 's western borders with @entity3 - which @entity18 call @entity47 - and @entity48 are now under the control of the fanatical @entity1 militant group , which aims to establish an undemocratic @entity12 state			1
wide appeal : the magazine uses tabloid - style headlines in its account of @entity18 ' execution of 1,700 shi'ite soldiers ( pictured )			2
the description of @entity18 ' takeover of @entity60 is written - up in the style of a football match report propaganda : the magazine opens with several pages describing the history of @entity12 and attempts to justify @entity18 ' actions as a mission to correct the carving up of the region after the @entity71 many of the @entity18 militants active on social media encourage would - be jihadists in the @entity7 to contact them privately using the smartphone messenger system @entity77			1
several - including @entity78 , who gives regular jihad advice on social network @entity80 - even list their @entity77 usernames in their @entity83 biography			2
@entity78 has previously told supporters there is no mobile phone signal in the area in which @entity18 is fighting			0
however , he has repeatedly stated that the group are still able to communicate using smartphone messenger services			0
as such , it would appear @entity18 are employing @entity77 in much the same way as troublemakers used @entity95 's @entity94 messenger to privately organise themselves during the 2011 @entity97 riots			0
@entity18 has previously developed its own app for @entity103 phones , @entity98 of @entity99 , which leveraged @entity83 users â€™ accounts to share tweets related to the group			0

it goes on to boast that in a number of border crossings in western @entity2 , @entity18 has partially restored the geographical boundaries in place before the famous @entity125			0
after dedicating several pages to @entity18 ' views on @entity129 history , the magazine moves on to a picture - led account of the so - called @entity131 , written with tabloid headlines in the style of a football match report			2
@entity14 followers of @entity18 claim the battle , which took place earlier this month and led to the fall of @entity2 's second largest city @entity60 , led to the execution of 1,700 @entity142 soldiers			2
