by @entity0 described as the ' last stop at the bottom of the world ' by some of its 6,000 or so hapless and homeless residents , @entity2 ' @entity1 is a grim circus of pimps , drug dealers , hustlers and prostitutes			1
for most of the men and women sleeping and wandering the downtown streets of the @entity16 the idea of divine intervention is as distant as the glimmering lights of @entity20 and the @entity21			2
their stories are easy to ignore , which is what inspired one documentary filmmaker to brave the violent , tent filled sidewalks to reveal life for what it is on the mean streets of @entity34 's second city			1
scroll down for @entity35 inside public bathroom : this man is cooking up fake crack on a baby changing platform to sell to unwitting addicts who are too drug addled to know the difference and part with their cash having produced two prior films on the drug - addled addicts of @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity53 filmmaker , @entity46 decided to turn his attention to @entity1 in early 2013			1
however , his gonzo journalistic style almost landed him in trouble on his very first night filming			0
sitting in his car with his camera , @entity46 , 28 , was initiated immediately into the ways of the streets when around half - a - dozen guys stormed up to his car to demand why he was filming			1
' they thought i was an undercover cop , ' said @entity46 to @entity68			2
' they were screaming , ' you ca n't be doing that , ' said the documentary maker			0
in video from his recently released documentary of his 18 months on @entity1 , @entity77 , the terrifying incident is played out in full			1
watch video here : addiction : a heroin user shoots up to get his fix while sat on the streets of @entity1 in @entity2 desperate : this man snorts some form of powdered drugs to get high while @entity46 filmed his documentary on the streets of downtown @entity2 left behind : needles used by addicts liter the streets of @entity1 - left behind by the drug users who spend all their money on narcotics in the video , one man approaches the car , demonstrably calmer than the others and tells the filmmaker that he is being foolish			1
' people are doing personal private things around here ... we got entrepreneurs and other things around here			0
' that mans name is @entity104 and with his help , @entity46 managed to talk down the irate men			1
' i showed them my previous work and they came to believe that i was not a cop , but a genuine filmmaker , ' said @entity46 to @entity68			1
dividing line : even though downtown @entity2 is rapidly gentrifying , @entity1 remains an oasis of poverty ominous start : @entity46 took it upon himself to travel to @entity1 and begin filming - much to the anger of these men approaching his car danger : the men stopped @entity46 from leaving and the situation was rapidly falling out of control help : @entity104 came to @entity126 's ( right ) rescue and became his guide to the streets of @entity1 from that day on , @entity104 became the @entity53 's personal guide through @entity1 , opening doors that would have taken weeks , if not months to open			1
with his checkered criminal history of robbery and being a former gang member , @entity104 had the necessary trust among the residents of @entity1 for @entity46 to film startling confessions and shocking snippets of drug taking and abuse			1
some of the doors that @entity104 opened were quite literal			2
in one shocking episode from @entity142 , @entity104 and @entity46 walk up to a public toilet and knock on the door			1
broad daylight : this man takes drugs using a banknote in daylight with no fear of the police arresting him fix : once he had taken the drugs his face contorts as they take effect inside is a man sitting on the toilet cooking up what seems to be crack , but is in fact just bicarbonate of soda without any cocaine - fake crack			2
' this man had people knocking on the door begging to buy what they believed was crack cocaine , ' said @entity46			1
' the dealer said that they did n't know any better and that in their state , ' fake @entity171 ' might as well be ' real @entity171 ' and he was only there to make money from them			0
' fooling people and making money from the weak is what goes on on @entity1			2
' essential : gangs operate on the streets of @entity1 , flaunting their weapons openly street life : people literally stop and sleep and congregate along the sidewalks of @entity1 with nowhere else to be dealing : cocaine is prevalent in @entity1 and many dealers come from miles around to exploit the weak on the streets rocks : crack cocaine is the most popular drug that is sold in @entity1 and lays waste to thousands of lives indeed , the reality of @entity1 is that not all of those on the streets are destitute			1
an entire economy has sprung up around abusing the addicts , with drug dealers coming from miles around to ply their trade along the streets			1
the police do n't seem to care either said @entity46 , acting merely as peace - keepers and making sure the homeless do n't stray into the more affluent areas of rapidly gentrifying downtown @entity2			1
' when i first started my film i saw one man , who could n't have been older than my father , begging for crack , ' said @entity46			1
' he owed money and was about to be beaten up on the streets			2
' it 's a circus and not a good one at that			2
' interference : police make an arrest in @entity1 - which is unusual according to @entity46 - who told @entity68 they rarely interfere seeking to show the ' raw elements ' of the streets of @entity1 and not trying to make a political film , rajendrans visceral documentary is a chance he says for the people there to express themselves			1
no scene is more shocking than that of an elderly pimp and his similarly aged prostitute			0
' i do n't really like to call it pimping , ' says the man			2
' i am a player , and i take care of my girls and i look out for them , i have been doing this on and off for 20 years			0
' but you know , its about doing it right			0
it ai n't about beating up on females and mistreating them			0
' you make sure you treat them like a lady			0
' seeking permission to speak to the prostitute , her life is laid bare in shocking fashion by @entity251 interview			0
' i work real hard , ' she says			0
' it 's really hard out here sometimes and i stay out here until i get enough money for a motel room , food and my drugs too			0
pimp and his prostitute : one shocking episode of the documentary comes when an interview takes place between this pimp ( left ) and the woman who works for him ( right ) ' i have been doing this for 35 - years			0
' asked if her pimp is a ' good ' player , the woman replies earnestly			0
' yes , he is supportive , he makes sure i have what i need to get out there and get sleep , ' says the woman			0
' you know , he is strict because he has to be otherwise i would spend all my money on drugs			0
' he makes sure ...			0
i have my high heels , a clean dress , a clean change of underwear , condoms , he makes sure before we leave i have all that in my purse			0
' in an interview with @entity288 , @entity286 calls @entity104 a ' hustler ' and tells them that his guide has a bullet lodged in the back of his head which is slowly moving down into his spine			2
for his part , @entity104 believed that working on the documentary would be his ticket out of @entity1			1
' being part of this documentary made me take a step back and look at the environment i 've been so used to , ' says @entity104 in a statement on the film 's website			1
however , sadly , one week after filming stopped @entity104 was arrested and then arrested again			2
he is up for three felony charges , two counts of second - degree robbery and one count of assault with deadly weapon			0
for @entity46 though , this documentary is his attempt to show exactly what goes on the streets , hopefully opening peoples eyes to reality			1
@entity77 is available to buy on @entity319 and to watch on @entity320			0
