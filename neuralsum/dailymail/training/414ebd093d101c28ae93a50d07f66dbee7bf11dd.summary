@entity0 seemed in a relaxed mood on sunday afternoon as he was put through his paces by new coach @entity3			1
the pair were all smiles during the training session as the @entity8 reigning champion prepares for his match against @entity10 on @entity11 @entity3 certainly seemed to be working @entity0 hard as the @entity12 was drenched in sweat , but she still found time for a joke while out on the court			1
at 6ft 8in , it is no surprise that @entity10 's serve offers a big threat on grass in particular			2
but the 28 - year - old is no mug from the back of the court and is enjoying the best season of his career			0
he and @entity0 have played twice before , with the @entity12 winning easily at the @entity36 in 2010 and @entity10 doing the same a year later in @entity37			2
@entity0 certainly has the edge on experience given @entity10 has never been beyond the fourth round at any slam			2
all smiles : @entity3 seemed in a relaxed mood as she was hit by a fit of giggles out on court preparation : @entity0 ( left ) faces @entity10 in the 16 of @entity8 on monday speaking ahead of the match , @entity0 said : ' it will be a tough match			1
' ' he 's a big guy with a big game			0
he 's played some very good tennis this year			0
' it 's probably been his best year on the tour so far in terms of consistency			0
i 'll need to play a tough match to beat him			0
' looking good : the 27 - year - old has strolled through the first week on @entity8 obstacle : 6ft 8in @entity10 stands in the way of @entity0 and a quarter - final against @entity62			1
