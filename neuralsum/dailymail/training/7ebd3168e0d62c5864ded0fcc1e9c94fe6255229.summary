cancerous tumours may grow faster at night time , a new study has found			1
@entity3 researchers found that cancer cells grow and spread around the body more quickly during sleep , because of the relationship between two receptors in cancer cells			1
they concluded that giving cancer treatment at night might be more effective than administering drugs in the day time			2
tumours may grow and spread more quickly at night time , because of the relationship between two receptors in cancer cells , @entity3 researchers found the study looked at the activity of two receptors in cancer cells in mice			1
receptors are protein molecules on the cell 's surface or within cells which take in biochemical messages secreted by other cells and pass them on into the cell 's interior			1
scientists found that a receptor called the epidermal growth factor receptor ( @entity33 ) - which causes cancer cells to grow and migrate - is suppressed by the activity of another receptor			1
the second receptor binds to a steroid hormone called a glucocorticoid ( gc )			0
@entity40 plays a role in maintaining the body 's energy levels during the day			0
it is often called the stress hormone because levels of the gc steroid rise in stressful situations to make the body fully alert			0
with multiple receptors , the cell receives all sorts of messages at once , and some of these messages can take precedence over others			2
scientists found that when the gc receptor is bound to the steroid hormone gc , the activity of the @entity33 receptor in promoting the growth and migration of cancer cells is suppressed			1
they tested levels of @entity33 in mice throughout the day and found that the receptor is much more active during sleep and inactive in the early morning waking hours			2
researchers explained that levels of @entity40 steroids peak in the day and tail off at night , meaning in the day time the body suppresses @entity33 's activity in promoting cancer cell growth			1
however , in the night when levels of @entity40 steroids are low , @entity33 is not suppressed , and promotes growth and migration of cancer cells			1
the scientists then wanted to know how their findings affected treatment using drugs which fight cancer			0
it could be more efficient to give anti-cancer drugs at night , the study found they gave @entity88 - a drug used to treat breast cancer â€“ to mice with cancer			1
@entity88 is designed to inhibit @entity33 and so to prevent the growth and migration of the cancer cells			1
in the experiment , they gave the mice the drug at different times of day			0
they found that there were significant differences between the sizes of tumours in the different groups of mice , depending on whether they had been given the drug during sleep or waking hours			0
these findings suggested that it is indeed the rise and fall in the levels of @entity40 steroids over 24 hours that promotes or inhibits the growth of cancer			0
researchers concluded that it could be more efficient to give anti-cancer drugs at night			2
professor @entity117 , of the @entity118 in @entity3 , one of the study 's researchers , said : ' it seems to be an issue of timing			0
' ' cancer treatments are often administered in the daytime , just when the patient 's body is suppressing the spread of the cancer on its own			2
' what we propose is not a new treatment , but rather a new treatment schedule for some of the current drugs			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity139 .			0

cancer cells grow and spread at night because of the activity of receptors
receptors are protein molecules on the cell 's surface or within a cell
they take in biochemical messages from other cells and pass them inside
epidermal growth factor receptor ( @entity33 ) causes cell growth and migration
but it is suppressed in the day by the activity of another receptor
in the night it is not suppressed , causing cancer cells to grow and spread
anti-cancer drugs which suppress @entity33 work better at night , study found
