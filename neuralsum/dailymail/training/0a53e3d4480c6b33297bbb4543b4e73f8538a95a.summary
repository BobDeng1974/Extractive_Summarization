the @entity0 is just 29 days away and excitement is building			1
each week our man in @entity4 , @entity2 , brings us the latest news and views from @entity7 - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the @entity0 in @entity4 is shaping up			1
if @entity13 's so worried , should n't @entity12 be a little bit concerned too ? with all the focus on the @entity0 opener against top seeds @entity18 in the @entity19 a month from today , @entity14 are in danger of flying a little under @entity22 's radar			1
we told you last week how the greatest never to win a @entity0 insisted the one team he did n't want @entity4 to meet in the knock - out stages was none other than @entity12 's second opponents next month			1
' i would prefer to meet @entity31 in the final			0
not @entity14 , ' he said			1
' i think @entity14 could be the only team who could psychologically shake the @entity36 team			1
but in the @entity36 sporting lexicon @entity14 is a dirty word			1
it might come as a surprise to some that no matter what way the tournament progresses , the hosts can not play at the @entity55 until the final			2
would n't the sacred , spiritual home have been a helpful , inspirational staging point come the last 16 or quarter - finals ? not in a @entity0 it would n't			1
the place is the graveyard of @entity0 dreams here and the @entity63 , when @entity4 needing only a draw to win the 1950 cup on home soil imploded and handed glory to their noisy neighbours , still send shivers down spines in @entity71			1
@entity22 might just have felt a slight chill over the past 48 hours too when he saw the 25 - man squad assembled by his counterpart @entity74			0
high on talent , high on tenure , high on terrifying attackers , it 's a big tournament calibre squad from a country that just loves big tournaments			2
fearful : @entity4 legend @entity13 believes that @entity14 are the team best equipped to cause the hosts problems winners of two of the four previous @entity87 to be played in their home continent , @entity14 have also been losing semi-finalists another three times			1
all in all , not too shabby a record for a country with an almost identical population to @entity92			0
@entity22 's embraced the movement for change and called upon his young lions , but experience counts too			2
@entity14 have just three players with 10 caps or less in their panel and could have just one by the time the final squad cut is made			2
@entity12 on the other hand , will bring nine such inexperienced men to @entity4			1
of course there are question marks , no country is immune from those			0
a lot of those centre on the skipper @entity109 , who endured a horror campaign in the @entity111 with @entity112			0
but he has always been a different beast with the national team 's armband strapped on			2
and around him , @entity117 's @entity116 , @entity119 's @entity118 and @entity120 of @entity121 could join camp with league winners medals from three different countries			1
goal getter : @entity14 's @entity126 has proven himself to be a reliable frontman at the top level @entity129 is full of competition with three insiders based here in @entity4 - @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 - joining @entity119 's @entity136 and a host of other @entity139 - based veterans and a couple of younger faces , among them @entity143 's @entity142			1
it is up front though where the chills really begin to kick in			2
the triumvirate of @entity40 , @entity126 and @entity148 might not match @entity31 's trio of @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 as the tournament 's most ferocious front three			2
but they 're a close runner - up			0
between them they have scored 94 international goals			0
@entity12 's entire 23 - man squad have scored just 15 more			1
for now , all roads may lead to @entity162 but the trajectory will quickly shift to @entity164 and what will be the defining match of @entity12 's campaign			1
@entity14 may have been the last team to book their ticket to @entity4 but it would be foolish to expect them to be the first going home			1
even if it would make the hosts breathe a whole lot easier			0
lots to think about : @entity12 's players face two tough group games against @entity18 and @entity14 in @entity4 the countdown clock has hit the 20s and still @entity4 scrambles to welcome the world			1
incredible though it may seem four weeks out from the kick - off , but three stadiums still remain unfinished			2
the venue for the opening ceremony will mercifully host its first proper match this weekend when @entity186 make their debut in their new home			2
because they simply have to be , all arenas will be completed			0
but a report in yesterday 's @entity164 newspaper @entity191 , laid bare just how little else will be ready			1
of the public transport upgrades and projects promised when @entity4 won the staging rights , an eye - wateringly low 10 per cent have been delivered			1
@entity197 's airport might just be the most prime of all examples			1
the city which had the first stadium over the line , inexplicably none of the other 11 projects promised in @entity197 are finished			2
and instead of a shiny new terminal to welcome the hundreds of thousands of fans pitching up for a whopping six games in the city , visitors will instead be herded through a temporary canvas structure			0
if you 're thinking something along the lines of the opening credits of @entity214 you 're not alone			0
it 's unlikely to be nearly as funny though			0
it 's a crying shame			0
way behind schedule : construction workers frantically try to finish off the @entity220 on time not only did he welcome new plus one @entity223 to @entity224 this week for a flying visit during which she hit the town with the @entity227 but he might just feature in this weekend 's title decider against @entity119			1
expected not to play a competitive game again until the @entity0 after picking up a foot injury last month , @entity4 's talisman is ahead of schedule			1
' i am in the home straight in terms of recovery and i ’ll see if i am able to play ( against @entity119 ) , ' he confirmed on monday			1
and the nation breathes a sigh of relief			0
introductions : @entity243 's girlfriend @entity223 joined the @entity4 superstar briefly in @entity224 the @entity36 championship is a full four rounds old			1
but that 's more than enough time for the most trigger - happy league in the world to start catching up with the @entity111 in the sack race			0
this @entity253 goal from a couple of inches out helped @entity256 to a 2 - 0 victory over arch rivals @entity258 in the @entity259 on sunday			0
it led to @entity258 sacking @entity261 , who in the process became the sixth manager shown the door in the top tier already this season			0
sixth ... in less than a month			0
makes @entity12 's top flight look like a pleasant place to work remember me ? @entity271 ( @entity272 and @entity4 ) the rejection felt by @entity275 duo @entity274 and @entity276 last week as @entity277 ignored the merits of both when picking his final squad was also shared by a former @entity280			1
@entity271 once cost @entity275 £ 3million when he joined from @entity281 in 2008			0
but after just two seasons at @entity283 during which he never once featured in the league , in spite of a couple of impressive cup cameos , he was allowed to leave by @entity22			0
back home with @entity256 he rediscovered his form and was part of the @entity292 - winning @entity4 panel last summer			2
but he was the odd man out last week as @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 were picked for @entity0 duty			2
that 's kind of in keeping with how things have been going for everyone linked with @entity275 of late			0
old face : @entity271 , formerly of @entity275 , narrowly missed out on the @entity4 squad after a run of good form @entity304 : mosquitos will be feasting on the many @entity0 visitors @entity308 tip : bring the bug spray not brave enough to venture up to @entity162 ? then you do n't have to worry about tropical diseases , right ? wrong			1
dengue fever is alive and really kicking throughout @entity4 , even in urban centres with 1.4million cases last year			2
speaking from painful experience , native mosquitoes take a particular shine to pasty @entity139 skin			0
so pack the strongest bug spray lawmakers will let you bring on a plane			0
@entity19 forecast : how ’s the weather up in @entity162 ? we finally got some first - hand experience of just how hot and wet it gets up there during a brief visit last weekend			0
there is not a garment invented by man that can soak up all the sweat when the humidity hits			0
thankfully though , the next tropical downpour is never too far away and a socking rain is actually pretty refreshing			0

@entity4 legend @entity13 claims @entity12 's @entity43 opponents @entity14 are the team best equipped to beat the host
the @entity0 is set to kick off with most of the transport infrastructure in @entity164 and @entity197 unfinished
@entity4 star @entity243 has introduced girlfriend @entity344 to @entity224 and he expects to play in the @entity346 title *showdown* against @entity119
six managers have been sacked in the first four rounds of @entity4 's @entity350
