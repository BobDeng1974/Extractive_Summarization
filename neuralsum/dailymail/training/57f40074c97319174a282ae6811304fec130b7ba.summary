they are largely thought to have roamed the freezing landscapes of @entity2 during the last ice age , but it seems @entity5 may have spread far further east and lived alongside modern humans there for longer than was previously thought			1
two new pieces of research have suggested that the ancestors of modern @entity11 may have interbred with the now extinct @entity5 far more than they did in @entity2			1
analysis of the traces of @entity14 found in the genomes of modern humans has shown that people in @entity18 carry between 15 to 30 per cent more of their dna than @entity2			1
this suggests that @entity5 were able to spread further towards @entity18 than was previously thought			1
an ancient partial skull has provided the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside @entity5 and could have interbred 55,000 years ago			2
recently discovered in @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , the bone sheds new light on our ancient relatives living in the area			0
the find challenged previous theories that the two species potentially met 45,000 years ago somewhere in @entity2			0
modern @entity2 have inherited between two and percent of their genes from @entity5 , meaning the two groups mated at some point in the past			2
a recent study also suggested that many modern diseases are actually caused by dna that we inherited from this now extinct branch of the human evolutionary tree			0
these ' legacy ' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes			0
some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases			0
scientists have found that part of our @entity64 system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from @entity5			0
almost all of the remains of @entity5 have been found in southern @entity2 and western @entity18			1
they were not thought to have gone much further east than the @entity70 in central @entity18 , on the borders of what are now @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
but the new findings have raised the prospect that @entity5 lived in the east of the continent and may have clung on there for longer than their @entity2 relatives , who died out around 30,000 years ago - we have just yet to find the archaeological evidence			1
professor @entity85 , a geneticist at the @entity86 who led one of two new studies , said : ' the history of admixture between modern humans and @entity5 is most likely more complex than previously thought			2
' the research was conducted by two separate teams working at the @entity86 and the @entity94 , @entity95			0
professor @entity85 and his colleague @entity97 analysed distinctive patterns in the dna of 379 modern @entity2 and 286 modern @entity11 from @entity99 and @entity100			2
using computer models they attempted to simulate how the mixtures of @entity14 seen in the @entity2 and @entity18 genomes could have occurred they concluded that one theory - that modern @entity2 interbred more with populations from @entity108 to water down the @entity5 dna they carried - was unlikely			1
much of what we know about @entity5 has come from examining their bones , like the skull above , but now dna extracted from their fossilised remains is helping to shed new light on what their lives were like instead they found it was more likely that ancestors of the @entity18 populations had bred with @entity5 more than once			1
mr @entity97 said : ' one thing that complicates these analyses is the fact that humans have been constantly migrating throughout their history - this makes it hard to say exactly where interactions with @entity5 occurred			0
' it 's possible , for example , that all of the interbreeding with @entity5 occurred in the @entity138 , before the ancestors of modern non-africans spread out across @entity141			1
' in the model from the paper , the ancestors of all non-africans interbred with @entity5 , and then split up into multiple groups that would later become @entity2 , @entity11			1
' shortly after they split up , the ancestors of @entity11 interbred with @entity5 just a little bit more			1
' the important thing is that we show that we did n't just meet @entity5 once in our history - it looks like we met them multiple times			1
' but as we are able to look at individuals from more and more populations , we 'll hopefully get a better idea of where our ancestors have been , and where they may have interacted with @entity5			0
' previous research has led to theories that modern humans first interbred with @entity5 as they migrated through the @entity138 55,000 years ago before they then moved further into @entity2 and @entity18			1
the evidence that a second mixing between the two species took place among @entity18 populations implies that this occurred sometime later and further @entity138 than the first interbreeding event			2
this ancient partial skull found in @entity33 in @entity35 is thought to provide earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside @entity5 and could have interbred in the area around 55,000 years ago previous research has led to theories that modern humans first interbred with @entity173 as they migrated through the @entity138 55,000 years ago before they then moved further into @entity2 and @entity18			1
the evidence that a second mixing between the two species took place among @entity18 populations implies that this occurred sometime later and further @entity138 than the first interbreeding event			2
professor @entity85 says it is also possible that @entity2 ancestors bred with another as yet undiscovered species of ancient human that led to the @entity14 being watered down			0
however the second study conducted by dr @entity184 , an evolutionary geneticist at the @entity94 , used similar computer models and found that the most likely explanation was that @entity5 interbred with humans multiple times in @entity18			1
dr @entity184 said : ' it 's very hard to put these findings into spatial context			0
' the key idea is that there would have to have been some additional interbreeding events involving @entity11 , but not @entity2			2
' these interbreeding events could have been directly between @entity5 and @entity11 , maybe in some other indirect way			2
' dr @entity197 , an athropologist at @entity198 , said the findings should profoundly change our view of what @entity5 were like			0
neanderthals were thought to have been better adapted to the cold which allowed them to live in @entity2 and northern @entity18 through much of the last ice age before they died out around 30,000 years ago he said : ' it strongly suggests that rather than a one off interbreeding event between humans and @entity5 around 60,000 years ago there must have been multiple occurrences of humans and @entity5 having sex and producing offspring			1
' this in turn suggests that the boundaries between humans and @entity5 as different species are increasingly becoming blurred almost to the point of being non-existent			0
' this of course has huge significant for those who wrongly claim the neanderthals were less intelligent , did n’t have symbolism and could n’t speak			0
' we can no longer think of @entity228 as the ‘ top dog ’ who replaced the more primitive hominin species it encountered on the long trip out of @entity108			0
' rather we should think of our direct ancestors as one member of a diverse genus that interbred with other members of @entity239 multiple times and in multiple locations			1
' professor @entity241 , one of the world 's leading anthropologists at the @entity244 in @entity245 , added that our view of @entity5 had perhaps wrongly become too ' eurocentric '			0
he said : ' the common view is that @entity5 were ' @entity2 ' , because that is where the original and the most famous remains of this species have been discovered			2
' but we have known since the 1930s that they were in @entity18 too , and we now have their fossils from sites in countries like @entity35 , @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258			0
' more fragmentary remains have recently been studied in @entity260 , and the highest quality @entity5 genome is from @entity263 in the @entity70			0
' while there have been claims that @entity5 lingered longest in places like @entity267 , we only have a poor fix on the dating of their disappearance further @entity138			0
' so it is certainly quite possible that there was further interbreeding with late @entity5 as modern humans traversed @entity18 , although we still lack decent fossil evidence from many regions , particularly in southern @entity18			2

scientists say @entity5 and humans may have interbred multiple times
people in @entity18 carry 15 to 30 *%* more @entity5 dna than @entity2
they say @entity2 appear to have interbred on just one occasion
but the ancestors of @entity11 may have interbred for a second time
it suggests @entity5 spread far further east than originally thought
their remains are concentrated in @entity2 and as far east as central @entity18
*experts* say @entity5 in the @entity138 may have *outlived* those in @entity2
