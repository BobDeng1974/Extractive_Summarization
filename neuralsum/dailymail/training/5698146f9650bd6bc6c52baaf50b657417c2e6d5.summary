by @entity0 a virus never before seen in the @entity3 has killed millions of baby pigs in less than a year , and with little known about how it spreads or how to stop it , it 's threatening pork production and pushing up prices by 10 percent or more			1
scientists think porcine epidemic diarrhea , which does not infect humans or other animals , came from @entity13 , but they do n't know how it got into the country or spread to 27 states since last may			1
the federal government is looking into how such viruses might spread , while the pork industry , wary of future outbreaks , has committed $ 1.7 million to research the disease			1
virus : dr. @entity23 stands with hogs in one of his @entity27 , @entity28 , hog buildings			2
the farmer did all he could to prevent porcine epidemic diarrhea from spreading to his farm , but the deadly diarrhea attacked in november 2013 , killing 13,000 animals in a matter of weeks spreading virus : last summer , the porcine epidemic diarrhea had been found in 16 states , shown in red			2
it has now spread to some 27 nationwide the @entity3 is both a top producer and exporter of pork , but production could decline about 7 percent this year compared to last — the biggest drop in more than 30 years , according to a recent report from @entity46 , which focuses on the food , beverage and agribusiness industries			1
already , prices have shot up : a pound of bacon averaged $ 5.46 in february , 13 percent more than a year ago , according to the @entity3 @entity53			1
@entity54 and chops have gone up too , although not as much			2
@entity56 and longtime veterinarian @entity23 did all he could to prevent @entity57 from spreading to his farm in @entity28 , the nation 's top pork producer and the state hardest hit by the disease			2
he trained workers to spot symptoms , had them shower and change clothing before entering barns and limited deliveries and visitors			0
despite his best efforts , the deadly diarrhea attacked in november , killing 13,000 animals in a matter of weeks , most of them less than 2 weeks old			0
the farm produces about 150,000 pigs each year			2
deadly : @entity57 , a virus never before seen in the @entity3 has killed millions of pigs in less than a year , and with little known about how it spreads or how to stop it , it ¿ s threatening pork production and pushing up prices by 10 percent or more pigging out : the virus as seen under the electron microscope estimates of how many pigs have died in the past year vary , ranging from at least 2.7 million to more than 6 million			1
the @entity3 @entity87 says the die - off has had a hand in shrinking the nation 's pig herd by 3 percent to about 63 million pigs			1
diarrhea affects pigs like people : symptoms that are uncomfortable in adults become life - threatening in newborns that dehydrate quickly			1
the best chance at saving young pigs is to wean them and then pump them with clear fluids that hydrate them without taxing their intestines			0
but nothing could be done for the youngest ones except euthanasia			0
" it 's very difficult for the people who are working the barns at that point , " @entity23 said			0
" ... no one wants to go to work today and think about making the decision of baby pigs that need to be humanely euthanized because they ca n't get up anymore			0
those are very hard days			0
" @entity57 thrives in cold weather , so the death toll in the @entity3 has soared since december			0
no cure : @entity125 prices are rising as a virus sweeps though the @entity3 , killing baby pigs			1
the @entity0 reported that the @entity128 , which has never been seen in the @entity3 , has already killed millions of pigs in twenty seven states the first reports came from the @entity132 , and the states most affected are those with the largest share of the nation 's pigs : @entity28 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			2
the disease also has spread to @entity142 and @entity143			0
some states now require a veterinarian to certify that pigs coming in are virus - free , while @entity13 , which has seen repeated outbreaks since the 1980s , has asked the @entity3 @entity87 to similarly vouch for animals shipped overseas			1
companies are racing to develop a vaccine , but the federal government has yet to approve one			0
while the mass deaths have been a blow for farmers , the financial impact to them may be limited because pork prices are rising to make up for the loss of animals			1
it takes about six months for a hog to reach market weight so the supply will be short for a while			0
@entity166 , one of the nation 's largest pork processors , has cut some plant shifts to four days per week in @entity139 , and those in the @entity132 are likely to do so later this spring , said @entity171 , an @entity28 - based economist and pork industry consultant			1
piggy in the middle : farmers are desperately attempting to take measures to curtail the epidemic , ranging from basic hygiene to euthanasia of livestock in the end , consumers will be most affected , @entity171 said , with pork prices likely to be 10 percent higher overall this summer than a year ago			1
" we 're all used to : ' we 've got plenty of food , it 's cheap			0
we 'll eat what we want to , ' " @entity171 said			0
" we @entity3 are very spoiled by that , but this is one of those times that we 're going to find out that when one of these things hits , it costs us a lot of money			0
