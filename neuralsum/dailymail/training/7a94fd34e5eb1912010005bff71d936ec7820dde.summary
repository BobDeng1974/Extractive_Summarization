by @entity0 a @entity3 couple 's dream to sail around the world with their two young daughters got off to a stormy start just two weeks into the voyage			2
the @entity9 had to come to the aid of @entity11 and @entity12 after their daughter fell seriously sick just as their sailboat became stranded			1
the couple and their children @entity17 , 1 , and @entity18 , 3 , were rescued about 900 nautical miles off the @entity20 coast a fortnight after they set sail from @entity23 in their 36ft yacht , @entity25			1
rough seas : @entity11 and @entity12 with their daughters @entity17 , left , and @entity29 , before they set sail adventure : the lure of @entity32 encouraged @entity11 to set sail with his wife and two young daughters for years the couple , who are experienced sailors , had dreamed of sailing to remote islands in the @entity38 on the boat they bought in 2005			1
on their blog - @entity42 - they wrote of excitedly waiting on march 20 for the right conditions before setting sail on the well - stocked boat			0
with a toddler just learning to walk , and a curious three - year - old on board , the couple knew their voyage would n't all be plain sailing , but they could never have predicted that they would be calling for help so quickly			1
in her early blog posts about the voyage @entity55 , a teacher and owner of an @entity58 baby boutique , wrote about trying to keep a constant watch on their girls , as she coped with seasickness			0
as well as needing space to keep their children entertained , the couple have filled the boat with supplies of cans , dried good , diapers and fresh food			2
off course : the family set sail from @entity3 on march 20 but had to call for help on april 3 , 900 nautical miles of @entity20 home from home : the family planned to sail around the world on @entity25 , a 36ft boat sick bay : @entity82 and @entity17 , who suffered a fever and sickness while out to sea but despite choppy conditions , the family were relishing their adventure , singing and laughing in the cabin , and showering on deck as their boat glided through the @entity38			1
day one i can see the magic of being out to sea , but i ca n’t really taste it			0
our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes , gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer , and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance			2
day two our foresail , stay sail , and main sail , hold fast , all strong and white , like our painted wooden mast , and i can feel their excitement to be used like this again ; they were made for blue - water sailing , and apparently , so were we			0
day @entity117 started out sh * * * * too			0
it is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful			0
day six i ca n’t possibly describe the range of emotions i have felt so far : anger , joy , sickness , exhaustion , exhilaration , wonder , awe , contentment , peace			0
day eight i think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [ but ] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life			0
day eleven when i woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you ca n’t escape at night			2
day thirteen thirteen days at sea ... we are in good spirits , as good as you can be , considering			0
three days later the family contacted the @entity9 for help on the second day of their voyage , mrs @entity12 wrote : ' it is simple things that excite a crew when out to sea ... like the turtle calmly paddling in the opposite direction as us			1
' she also described how she and her husband , who works for a financial services company , gave each other fist bumps when they first realized they could no longer see land in any direction			0
but the exotic and remote @entity38 islands where they were headed must have seemed like a distant dream when their youngest daughter fell sick			1
the romance of life at sea was replaced with a longing for modern appliances like washing machines that other families rely so heavily on			0
in one blog post , mrs @entity12 wrote : ' i think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done , ' as she described the difficulty of trying to hand wash poopy diapers			0
the biggest trial came when @entity17 suffered illness for several days , resulting in the family calling for help from the @entity9			1
on thursday night a four - member team from the @entity190 parachuted into the sea and got @entity17 the medical treatment she needed , the @entity187 reported			2
the boat , which had been stranded in dead water , has also been repaired and is heading back to shore at @entity197 to give the family time to regroup			1
it is not the first time the couple have had to rechart their planned course across the @entity38			1
they have been slowly circumnavigating the world since buying their boat in 2005 and attempted a different section of the voyage when mrs @entity12 was pregnant with their second child			0
dream voyage : the family have had to cut short their planned trip across the @entity38 back on dry land : the family are heading back to shore after suffering sickness and boat problems however , a combination of morning sickness , sea sickness and a toddler in tow meant mrs @entity12 returned to shore			1
as she wrote about the experiences in @entity229 , she mused on how pleased she was to have returned to dry land , after suffering a couple of pregnancy complications which would have been difficult to handle out to sea			2
it is not clear if the family will try to embark on their @entity38 adventure again , but the lure of far - flung islands is bound to have them longing for the open ocean before long .			1

couple were headed to the @entity38 with their children , aged 1 and 3
@entity9 crew parachuted in to deliver medicine to toddler
family are now heading back to shore in their 36ft yacht
