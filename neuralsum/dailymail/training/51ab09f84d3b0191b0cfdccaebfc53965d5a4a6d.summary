by @entity0 published : 12:53 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 03:12 est , 31 january 2014 what was once believed to be a camp for the @entity5 builders in @entity6 may have actually been barracks for the @entity9 ’s military troops			1
archaeologists have discovered evidence of barracks close to an ancient port suggesting the settlement could have been home to soldiers or sailors			1
the findings call into question previous theories that thousands of workers would have set up camp in the region while building the pyramid of @entity6			1
archaeologists have discovered evidence of what is believed to be ancient barracks , pictured , close to the site of a port near @entity6 in @entity31			1
the location of the barracks to this port suggests the settlement could have been home to soldiers or sailors @entity38 was the son of @entity39 and the grandson of @entity41			1
he was born in @entity42 and reigned for approximately 22 years - although some reports put this figure higher			0
he was part of the 4th dynasty and during his reign , @entity38 commissioned the final pyramid in @entity6 to be built			1
it is known as the @entity50 or @entity51 - er - @entity52 , which means ' @entity38 is divine			0
' a monument close to the site of the pyramid was built in honour of @entity58 @entity57 , believed to be @entity38 's daughter			2
@entity38 was buried in this pyramid and a sarcophagus was excavated from the burial chamber in 1837 before being shipped to the @entity63 in @entity64			0
researchers from @entity66 ( @entity67 ) based in @entity68 have been excavating the site , situated approximately 1,300ft south of the @entity71 of @entity6 , since 1988			1
last year , they discovered a large collection of animal bones , evidence of an ancient slaughter house for animals and a cemetery , thought to have been full of the bodies of pyramid workers			1
the site is popularly known as the @entity81 , or @entity82 and is believed to date back to the reign of pharaoh @entity38 at around @entity85			2
@entity38 was the son of @entity39 and the grandson of @entity41 and commissioned the final pyramid in @entity6 to be built , known as the @entity50 or @entity51 - er - @entity52 , which means ‘ @entity38 is divine			2
’ this reconstruction of the ancient barracks shows how troops lived and worked in the three - storey settlement			2
the total size of the site is said to cover almost ten football pitches			0
@entity67 believes the it would have been built in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of pharoahs @entity39 and @entity38 @entity98 also found a large basin , pictured , near the site of the barrackes , suggesting the area may have been a port			1
this was bolstered by the fact the basin was found approximately half a mile away from a channel of the @entity108 however , more recent findings near this site , close to a monument dedicated to what is said to be @entity38 ’s daughter @entity57 , suggest the area may have been a port			1
excavators discovered a large basin that may have formed part of a harbour or waterfront			1
this was bolstered by the fact the basin was found approximately half a mile away from channel of the @entity108			2
@entity67 director @entity125 and his team also found charcoal remains of trees that came from the @entity129 , a region in the eastern @entity131 , along with pottery and jars for the same location			2
this reconstructions shows how the galleries may have looked			0
it is thought that sailors may have travelled to and from the barracks from the @entity129			0
researchers also found charcoal remains of trees , and pottery from the @entity129 region in the eastern @entity131 elsewhere , on the site of the @entity81 , the archaeologists found evidence of long buildings called galleries , pictured , that could have been used to house visitors to the port			1
the galleries would have been approximately 113ft long and 23ft tall the site of the @entity67 dig is popularly known as the @entity81 of the @entity155 ( pictured ) because of its close proximity to the @entity6 pyramids			2
last year , researchers discovered a large collection of animal bones , evidence of an ancient slaughter house , and a cemetery , thought to have been full of the bodies of pyramid workers			1
however , the latest findings suggest the site was used by sailors and troops , which has raised questions surrounding where the workers lived , and died			2
in 2004 , remains of builders were found in ancient dumps near the structures , but not evidence of buildings or a settlement were found			1
@entity67 's director @entity180 told @entity181 he believes the builders slept on the ramps they are believed to have used to construct the vast landmarks			0
for centuries it 's been thought that the ancient @entity31 built their huge pyramids by hauling heavy granite blocks up these specially crafted ramps			0
yet @entity191 engineer @entity190 has branded this ‘ impossible ’ , claiming the ramps would need to have been a quarter of a mile long or else they would have been too steep to carry the large blocks up			0
he believes , instead , that the @entity31 built an inner core of zigzagging ramps , using smaller , lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding			0
if this is true , this would cast doubt on @entity205 's claims about where the workers slept - once again raising the question about where they stayed			0
materials used to build the pyramids in the region could have been transported along the @entity108 to this port , and may have been distributed via the settlement harbour			0
elsewhere , on the site of the @entity81 , the archaeologists found evidence of long building called galleries that could have been used to house visitors to the port			1
it is thought that sailors may have travelled to and from the @entity129 , or troops used to guard the pharaoh and his family and friends			0
researchers from @entity66 ( @entity67 ) based in @entity68 have been excavating the site , marked at @entity230 , situated approximately 1,300ft south of the @entity71 of @entity6 , since 1988 the galleries would have been approximately 113ft long and 23ft tall			1
in 2012 , researchers found the hip of a hippo			0
a ritual in ancient @entity31 among troops involved hunting and harpooning hippos , and the discovery of the hip adds weight to these claims troops occupied the area at some time			0
the total size of the site is said to cover almost ten football pitches			0
@entity67 believes the development of the urban complex would have been ' quite rapid ' , and happened in the 35 to 50 years that spanned the reigns of @entity39 and @entity38 .			0

researchers have been excavating remains near the city of @entity6 since 1988
last year they found a cemetery believed to contain pyramid builders
yet , a large basin found nearby suggests the region may have been a port
there is also evidence of barracks just south of the @entity71 of @entity6
therefore the site may have been used by troops or sailors visiting the port
