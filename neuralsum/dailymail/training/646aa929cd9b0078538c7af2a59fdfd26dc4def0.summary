by @entity0 last updated at 12:20 pm on 12th november 2011 sisters @entity1 and @entity3 have baffled doctors with their survival after they were both diagnosed with the rare tumours			1
four - year - old @entity3 has two tumours in her heart and one in her brain , while @entity1 , 15 months , has a tumour so big that doctors say they have never seen one that size before			1
amazingly she is still alive and leads a normal life in @entity16 , @entity17 , because one of her heart chambers has grown bigger , to compensate for the size of the tumour			2
hereditary condition : @entity3 ( back ) and @entity1 ( front ) @entity3 both suffer from @entity25 - a disorder which causes the tumours to grow their mother @entity27 , 27 , who is studying to be a social worker , said she and her 51 - year - old husband @entity30 were devastated when the girls were diagnosed with the hereditary condition @entity25 - a disorder which causes tumours to grow in the brain , nervous system , kidneys and heart			1
‘ @entity1 was diagnosed before she was born after doctors spotted the tumour on the scan			1
they told us she was n’t going to survive , so the fact she is still here is amazing			0
‘ then a few months after she was diagnosed , @entity3 was tested too , and they found two tumours on her hearts			1
‘ but they do n’t let it get them down			0
the doctors are amazed at them			0
they can run around and play just like their friends			0
’ devastated parents : @entity55 , 27 , and her husband @entity30 , 51 , were devastated when their daughters were diagnosed the devastating news was given to mrs @entity3 when she was 28 weeks pregnant			1
she went for a scan at hospital and doctors spotted a mass in the baby ’s heart			2
she was referred to @entity65 in @entity66 and doctors told her that it was a tumour that was going to kill her unborn baby			0
mrs @entity3 , who is married to council worker @entity30 , said : ‘ we were absolutely devastated			2
‘ they told me that i needed to terminate the baby as there was no way she would survive			0
the tumour was so big it was going to kill her			0
' it was covering the whole left side of her heart and they said they had never seen one so big			0
‘ but we went home and i knew there was no way i could kill my baby			0
so we decided not to go ahead with the termination and instead we waited to see what would happen			0
doting mother : @entity55 with @entity89 , now 15 months , when she was a newborn , who was diagnosed with the tumour before she was born ‘ every time she stopped moving i thought that was it , that we had lost her			1
' we even bought her a blanket and a little outfit to bury her in			0
' the midwife told us to get as many memories as we could , so we bought casting kits to take casts of her hands and feet when she was born to remember her by			0
’ @entity1 was born by caesarian at @entity103 in january last year , weighing @entity104			1
@entity3 , four , has two tumours in her heart and one in her brain the couple , who have four other children , twins @entity111 and @entity113 , nine , @entity114 , eight , and @entity115 , two , had her christened and she was taken down to special care			1
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ the doctors did n’t think she had long left , so they wheeled me down to see her			2
but as the hours went by , she hung on			0
they could n’t believe it			0
’ @entity1 was still alive after four days , so the couple were allowed to take her home			2
when she was five - months - old she had tests which showed she was suffering from @entity25			1
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ we were devastated when @entity1 was diagnosed			1
we were all tested as it is a hereditary condition			1
@entity30 has the condition too , although he has only ever had two lumps removed from his knee and arm and he was n’t diagnosed at the time			2
‘ all the other children were fine , apart from @entity3 who has also been diagnosed with it			1
‘ scans have shown that she has two tumours in her heart and one in her brain too			1
’ family portrait : @entity27 and @entity30 with their childrend ( from back left to right ) @entity111 , @entity114 , @entity113 ( from front left to right ) @entity115 , @entity3 and @entity1 the couple are now taking one day at a time , as there is a possibility that if the tumours grow more they could put fatal pressure on organs , or they can turn cancerous			1
mrs @entity3 said : ‘ they are both developing normally at the moment and the doctors ca n’t believe how well @entity1 is doing as her tumour is so big			1
they expected her to have fits due to the size of it , but so far she is doing fine			0
‘ they are just normal little girls at the moment , which we are so grateful for			0
they have check - ups every six months and we do n’t know what the future will bring for them both			2
