by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 19 september 2013 startling differences in how long people can expect to lead healthy lives in the @entity4 compared to the @entity5 have been exposed for the first time			2
residents of the wealthiest southern parts of the country can expect to stay well and active for as much as 18 years longer than the nation ’s poorest , yesterday ’s official figures show			2
but in the @entity4 and deprived parts of @entity13 , illness and disability start much earlier			0
at worst , in the @entity17 , people can expect health problems to restrict their lives five years before pension age			2
divide : people in @entity22 are the healthiest while people in @entity24 and other areas of the north struggle with their health more the @entity29 figures are the first published estimates for healthy life expectancy – the age people are likely to reach before ill health seriously affects their quality of life			1
they show that an affluent borough in south - west @entity13 is the fittest part of the country			0
in green , suburban @entity22 upon @entity43 , newborn girls and boys are likely to live beyond 70 without suffering life - limiting illnesses			1
healthy life expectancy for babies born there now is 70.3 years for men , and 72.1 years for women			1
at the other end of the healthy living spectrum are @entity24 , for men , and @entity54 , for women			1
the @entity13 borough of @entity22 upon @entity43 has the highest healthy life expectancy ( @entity58 ) in @entity59 , according to the @entity29			1
whereas life expectancy is an estimate of how many years a person might be expected to live , healthy life expectancy is an estimate of how many years they might live in a ' healthy ' state men and women in @entity22 upon @entity43 ( above ) have an @entity58 of 70.3 years and 72.1 years respectively the lowest @entity58 was in @entity24 ( above ) for men at 55 years and @entity54 for women at 54.1 years - a 15 - year gap compared to @entity22 upon @entity43 in @entity24 men will typically find their health failing after 55 , while in @entity54 , a short distance across @entity13 from @entity22 , the estimates say ill health for women begins at 54.1 years of age			1
the findings are based on the @entity78 , a state survey that questions more than 250,000 people , in the years 2009 to 2011			2
the questionnaire asked whether people ’s general health was very good , good , fair , bad or very bad , and whether they had any long - standing disabilities that limited day - to - day activities			0
the @entity29 cautioned that the estimates do not give a definitive picture of the health people can expect as they age , partly because mortality and health continue to change , and partly because of the impact of migration			2
however the findings undoubtedly reveal large regional differences			0
the report said : ‘ the pattern across regions shows a prominent @entity5 divide : healthy life expectancy in the @entity100 , @entity101 and the @entity102 was significantly higher than the @entity59 average			1
‘ the @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity17 and @entity106 and the @entity107 were significantly lower			0
’ the report added that healthy life expectancy for men and women in the @entity112 , @entity104 , @entity13 , @entity106 and the @entity107 , @entity17 and @entity105 was well below 65 , which is the state pension age for men now and for women from 2018			1
it added : ‘ those living in the southern regions enjoy not only longer life expectancies but also greater proportions of their longer lives in a favourable health state compared with their counterparts living in the north			2
’ the @entity29 said the area with the highest gender inequality in life expectancy was @entity128 ( above ) , where women could expect to live an extra 6.2 years dr @entity130 , of the @entity131 , a professional body , said : ‘ these figures are an important part of a bigger picture of data that tells us why some people live longer than others			1
‘ we know healthy life expectancy is determined by our chances of being in a job , living in decent housing and having an adequate income			1
‘ clearly having a healthy lifestyle makes a big difference , but so does being in employment			0
‘ there are also variations within towns and cities			0
parts of @entity24 will have better results than others , and there may well be places near @entity22 where people do not fare as well as these figures suggest			1
’ in every area , both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were longer for women than for men			1
the smallest gap was in @entity164 , where women are expected to live just 1.9 years longer than men			1
the borough of @entity168 contains a number of affluent ' villages ' including @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 - and more than a third of it is open green space			0
unemployment in the borough currently stands at 4 per cent , one of the lowest in @entity180			0
according to the latest census figures , @entity22 upon @entity43 is one of the least ethnically diverse boroughs in @entity13 , with a non-white population of 14 per cent			1
it is also ranked as having the highest quality natural environment in @entity13			0
by contrast , the @entity29 said , the biggest difference between men and women was @entity128 , where women could expect to live an extra 6.2 years			1
@entity191 , director general of charity @entity192 , spoke out against plans to raise the state pension age , warning that in future most people will not be able to enjoy any of their retirement while still healthy			0
state pension ages for both men and women will begin to go up to 66 after 2020 – and will rise to 68 in the 2040s			2
miss @entity191 said : ‘ these figures reveal the huge variations in the health of older people across @entity59			0
it is further evidence that wealthier parts of the country have significantly more older people in good health than poorer areas			0
‘ these glaring health inequalities must be tackled urgently , particularly as the government is contemplating further increases to the state pension age			0
‘ otherwise the situation could easily arise where the average person in many areas will not enjoy any retirement in good health			0
’ a @entity222 spokesman said : ‘ these figures highlight that we must continue to work to narrow the gap in health inequalities because everyone should have the same opportunity to lead a healthy life , no matter where they live or who they are			2
‘ local councils have received ring - fenced budgets to help local people get healthier and to reduce health inequalities			0

men and women in @entity22 upon @entity43 have healthy life expectancy ( @entity58 ) of 70.3 years and 72.1 years respectively , according to @entity29
lowest @entity58 was in @entity24 for men , at 55 years , and @entity54 for women at 54.1 years
in every local *authority* *analysed* , life expectancy was longer for women than for men
