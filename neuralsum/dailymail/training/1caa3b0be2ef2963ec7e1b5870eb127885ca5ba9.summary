by @entity0 published : 09:04 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 13:38 est , 7 june 2013 if you 're hoping to lose a few pounds before you hit the beach in a bikini this summer then you might want to ditch regular trips to @entity6 coffee chains			0
many shop bought coffees have the equivalent calories to a fast food feast , with @entity11 in particular a repeat offender against dieters			1
and while many may now be up to speed with how calorific hot drinks such as full fat lattes are , they may find they 're not doing their waistlines any favours by instead opting for a cold drink from coffee shop summer menus			0
a sensible swap ? ditching a full fat latte , left , for a strawberry frappuccino with cream wo n't make you slimmer this summer it may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but a large @entity11 strawberry frappuccino contains a massive 459 calories because of its cream and full - fat milk content			1
that 's almost as many calories as a @entity36 's @entity35 the @entity11 peppermint mocha frappuccino in verdi with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories			1
@entity43 's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories - that 's the same as having a @entity49 's burger and fries			1
meanwhile , @entity52 's whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories , the equivalent to two large glasses of white wine and some pretzels			1
sales rising : more people are now turning to herbal teas as a healthier alternative to coffee shop drinks now that brands are under more pressure to display nutritional information on their products , consumers are becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees			2
as a result , sales of herbal tea is on the rise as people see them as a healthier alternative for a hot drink			0
herbal tea brand @entity80 has reported an increase in sales of 36 per cent in recent months , with customers citing that they were keen to embrace the low calorie benefits of teas			0
most herbal teas only have a trace amount of calories while some flavours rarely exceed 35 calories			2
a @entity80 spokesman said : ' it 's clear that ordering your favourite coffee can have a significant impact on your waistline			2
' herbal teas bridge this gap between calories and taste			0
there 's nothing wrong with the occasional coffee shop splurge , but keep calories low by mixing things up once in a while			1
' a study by @entity108 found that herbal tea drinkers believed they gained numerous health benefits from their choice of refreshment over coffee consumers			0
more than half ( 57 per cent ) said that drinking herbal tea helped them to relax while 64 per cent believe in their health benefits .			0
