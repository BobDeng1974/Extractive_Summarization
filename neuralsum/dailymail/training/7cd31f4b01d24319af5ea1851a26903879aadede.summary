@entity0 performed a spectacular u-turn on friday night by sacking @entity2 as their one - day captain less than two months before the @entity4			1
only five days after they insisted that @entity2 would lead them in the showpiece one - day tournament , @entity0 dramatically changed their minds and ditched the man they have invested so much in over the last year			1
@entity8 will now lead @entity0 at the @entity4 which starts in february and will be held in @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity2 after the defeat by @entity12 , his final match as @entity0 one - day captain @entity2 's form was horrendous - he had n't scored an odi century since june 2012 @entity8 is set to replace @entity2 as @entity0 's 50 - over skipper despite his own poor form @entity2 ultimately paid the price for a prolonged run of poor 50 - over form which has seen him average just 30 over the last two years at a pedestrian strike - rate of 73 and lead @entity0 to five one - day defeats in their last six series			1
yet it still came as a shock when it emerged on friday night that @entity0 were going to make a last - gasp change at the top because they have stuck with their man through thick and thin during a traumatic year for @entity31 cricket			0
last sunday @entity0 coach @entity32 , who has backed @entity2 emphatically since replacing @entity33 in april , said ahead of @entity0 ’s last one - day international in @entity12 : ‘ if you ask my opinion , @entity2 will be captain at the @entity4			1
’ then on monday , just before @entity0 ’s last defeat in their 5 - 2 series loss , managing director @entity37 added : ‘ i would be extremely surprised if he ’s not captain at the @entity4			2
’ now , with @entity0 leaving for a triangular series against @entity9 and @entity43 ahead of the @entity4 in just over a fortnight , the selectors have risked embarrassment by flying in the face of that faith they showed in @entity2			1
@entity32 met fellow selectors @entity49 and @entity51 at @entity52 on friday , while @entity53 joined them via a conference call from his holiday home in @entity56 and @entity37 sat in as a non-voting presence			0
@entity2 looks dismayed after being dismissed in the final odi of the series against @entity12 @entity2 plays and misses at one in @entity60 during another stuttering innings @entity62 told the selectors earlier in the week that it was not too late to ditch @entity2 they ultimately reached their decision because of @entity2 ’s inability to make a single decent score in the seven - match series in @entity12 even though they knew conditions there were never going to suit him			0
and the sense of @entity0 being in a state of one - day turmoil is added to by the fact that they will replace @entity2 with a batsman in @entity8 who has a worse one - day record throughout this year than the man he succeeds			1
at least @entity81 , such a key performer in @entity0 ’s one - day batting , seems to be galvanised by leadership — he has scored 427 runs at an average of 71 in eight previous matches as one - day captain			1
@entity2 , nothing if not a stubborn fighter , was said to be bitterly disappointed when he was told the axe had fallen because he was certain that his form would improve once he started playing in @entity92 conditions			0
@entity12 's @entity93 ( right ) celebrates with @entity94 after taking the wicket of @entity2 he was under extreme pressure when @entity0 lost to @entity43 in the second test at @entity98 ’s last summer but managed to turn things around dramatically to win three tests on the trot and was convinced he could do the same in one - day cricket			2
@entity2 , who has never played in a @entity4 , leaves the post having led @entity0 to more one - day victories than any other captain — 36 from 69 matches — which included taking them to the top of the one - day rankings in 2012 and the @entity112 final a year later			1
it was the way @entity2 confounded his one - day doubters after succeeding @entity115 in 2011 that convinced @entity0 he was still their man but they agonised over @entity2 ’s future when he lost one - day series to both @entity12 and @entity43 last summer			2
they stood firm then but have lost their nerve now			0
now , as well as @entity8 , the beneficiaries of @entity2 ’s misfortune look sure to be @entity123 , who will compete with @entity124 to become @entity126 ’s opening partner , and @entity128 batsman @entity127 , who was left out of the @entity130 squad			2
@entity0 had planned to make an announcement about the captaincy on friday night but have delayed it until this morning with new skipper @entity8 in @entity134			0
@entity49 , the national selector , will confirm the @entity4 squad at @entity136 that will do little to dispel the sporting adage that you become a much better player when you are out of a team rather than in it			0
@entity123 , dropped after two matches in @entity12 , @entity142 and the fit - again strike bowling pair of @entity144 and @entity145 will all form part of a 15 - man party that will begin as firm underdogs at the biggest one - day tournament of all			0
@entity0 captain cook leaves the field after being dismissed by @entity93 of @entity12 on december 11 @entity2 , who has suffered some vicious and personal abuse this year as he struggled to rebuild @entity0 from the ashes of their 5 - 0 defeat by @entity9 , has been told to recharge his batteries with his wife and daughter at their family farm			2
the news may be a blow to @entity2 , but it should ensure that he is in better condition , both mentally and physically , at the start of a run of 17 tests in little more than a year which begins when @entity0 tour the @entity166 in april			0
a refreshed @entity2 will be integral to @entity0 ’s hopes of regaining the @entity169 next summer which , whatever anyone in @entity31 cricket says , remains far more important than competing in a 50 - over tournament			0
@entity0 , who have not been @entity4 contenders since 1992 , have had to replace their one - day captains immediately after failed @entity4 campaigns going back to @entity178 in 1996 and continuing with @entity179 , @entity62 , @entity180 and @entity115			1
the only difference this time is that the axing has come before a @entity4 failure rather than after one .			0

@entity8 to replace @entity2 as @entity0 one - day captain
@entity2 has not scored an odi century since june 2012
@entity127 looks certain to be *restored* to the @entity190 squad
@entity4 is in @entity9 and @entity10 in february
