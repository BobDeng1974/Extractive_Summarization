by @entity0 for @entity1 we 're used to seeing them parade along our television screens , happily singing @entity6 or humorously saying ' simples '			0
but it seems @entity9 , @entity10 and their meerkat pals have a secret dark side			1
a new study has found the cuddly creatures are ' nasty , brutish and short ' - and are actually callous killers			1
dark side : they might look ' cute and fluffy ' , but meerkats have a dark side and are ' nasty and brutish ' , experts claim the study , carried out by a group of @entity24 and @entity25 universities , found the dominant female meerkat uses violence to survive and often abandons other females once they give birth			1
it then brutally kills and eats their offspring to ensure they have enough food for their own pup and their pool of meerkat ' babysitters '			2
the study 's leader , dr @entity40 , from the @entity43 's @entity42 , said the findings were all the more shocking because meerkats are ' cute and fluffy '			1
he said : ' since meerkats are cute and fluffy , and have been saccharine , anthropomorphized poster children for happy family life , it comes across as more shocking			1
' contrary to the public perception meerkat lives are " nasty , brutish and short "			0
' meerkats have been used as loveable creatures on the @entity9 adverts since 2009 - but researchers say that , in reality , they are not as nice as the advert would have you believe @entity10 , pictured here with @entity10 in the @entity60 , a @entity61 cartoon film , is also seen as a loveable creature the study , published in july in @entity64 , looked at the effect of giving contraceptive jabs to female helpers in groups of meerkats in the @entity70			1
the jabs ensured the helpers could not reproduce for six months			0
during that period , dominant females were less aggressive towards the helpers , foraged more , gained more weight and had bigger pups			0
the female helpers provided more care and food for the dominant female 's offspring			1
dr @entity40 wrote : ' we 've done the first clear experiment that measures the value that dominants gain from suppressing their subordinates			0
' such benefits have always been assumed , but never clearly confirmed			0
' dr @entity91 , an evolutionary biologist at @entity24 's @entity92 , who was not involved in @entity40 's study , said : ' that 's sort of the niche in which meerkats fit as a nice model , because there 's very strong hierarchy but subordinates do still try to breed			2
' meerkats are also competitive in captivity , according to @entity102 from the @entity104 zoo			0
the zoo , which has 20 meerkats , has previously had to split up a group when a young pup challenged a dominant female			2
it turned into a vicious scrap that @entity102 described as ' fighting for life or death ' .			0

new study shows the creatures are not as ' cute and fluffy ' as they seem
experts say female meerkats kill and eat others ' offspring to feed own pups
study leader said it is ' shocking ' because they are used as poster animals
