by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:51 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:10 est , 10 december 2013 @entity5 ’s @entity4 project has mapped the landmarks of @entity7 , the interiors of train stations and even the @entity10			1
but now anyone can document views of their favourite locations , which might not have been visited by @entity5 ’s cameras			1
members of the public can use an @entity19 smartphone or camera to take photographs and transform them into ' photo spheres ' using ‘ views ’ , which is a new feature of @entity24			1
here , ' photo spheres ' are connected to create a 360º view of @entity27			2
using the new service , photo spheres can be added to @entity24 and shared with people around the world users must visit ' @entity33 ' and open their profile page			2
they then manually select the photos they wish to connect to make a sphere of a 360º view			2
a map of the images is created with photo spheres marked in blue , sequentially with letters			0
to choose the location of a new photo sphere , users drag a dot to their chosen place and rotate them so landmarks or specific markers are facing in the right direction			1
photo spheres can be linked to others so that visitors to the site can jump between similar spheres			0
the idea is that users connect images together to create photo spheres - 360º views of a chosen location - which can then be added to @entity24 and shared with people around the world			1
to create a photo sphere , users can take a series of photos using an android smartphone or dslr camera and upload them to @entity33			1
there is no need for a ‘ @entity76 ’ backpack or special car , which are both used by @entity5 in its @entity4 mapping project			0
they then connect photos together on a map to create photo spheres , which when generated can be navigated by anyone using @entity24 , in a similar way to @entity4			2
@entity83 , product manager , @entity24 and @entity85 wrote in a blog : ‘ we are excited to see the different types of @entity4 experiences that everyone will contribute			0
’ he believes the feature could be used to allow environmental charitable organisations to document and promote the beautiful places they strive to protect			0

this is a photo taken by @entity5 's @entity83 , which was used as part of a photo sphere to choose the location of a new photo sphere , users drag a dot to their chosen place and rotate it so landmarks or specific markers are facing in the right direction ( pictured ) ‘ it also opens up a new tool for photographers to showcase diversity in a specific location - by times of day , weather conditions or cultural events - in a way that @entity4 currently does n’t cover , ’ he said			1
@entity5 also suggests that the new tool could also be used by businesses to show people what it is like inside their office or factory			0
‘ whether you ’re photographing exotic islands or your favourite neighbourhood hangout , mountain peaks or city streets , historic castles or your own business , we ’re thrilled to see the places you love coming to life on @entity24 , ’ mr @entity83 said			0
