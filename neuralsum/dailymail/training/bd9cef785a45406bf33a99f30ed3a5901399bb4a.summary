crocodiles are a close living relatives of birds , but compared to their feathered cousins , they are stuck in the past , scientists claim			2
both groups of animals share a common ancestor that lived around 240 million years ago , and also gave rise to the dinosaurs			1
but while birds quickly evolved after the demise of dinosaurs , the evolution of crocodilians has crawled along slowly			2
crocodiles are a close living relatives of birds , but compared to their feathered cousins , they are stuck in the past , scientists claim			2
the reptiles evolved at a slow rate after the demise of dinosaurs and their ' body plan ' has remained largely unchanged for millions of years , experts claim crocodilians make up the group of creatures that includes crocodiles , caimans , alligators and gharials			1
now , new genetic studies have revealed their unusually slow rate of genetic evolution			1
the sluggish progress of the reptiles has helped scientists build up a genetic picture of the archosaurs that predated dinosaurs , pterosaurs , birds and crocodilians			2
dr @entity41 , from the @entity42 at @entity43 , said : ‘ the ticking of the molecular clock in the crocodilians is much slower than in other lineages we ’re used to looking at , like mammals , which means we can see back into their past more cleanly			1
both crocodiles and birds share a common ancestor called archosaurs ( illustrated ) that lived around 240 million years ago			1
this ancestor also gave rise to the dinosaurs ‘ we know from fossils that the body plan of crocs has remained largely unchanged for millions of years			2
’ the team sequenced the genomes , or genetic blueprints , of three crocodilian species : the @entity68 alligator , the saltwater crocodile , and the @entity71 gharial			0
the study , published in the journal @entity74 , suggests that the ancestor of all archosaurs had an extremely slow rate of molecular evolution , which sped up in the bird lineage			1
after the meteor strike , which is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago , surviving birds experienced a rapid burst of evolution			1
after the meteor strike , which is thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago , surviving birds experienced a rapid burst of evolution			1
this led to nearly all the species of birds seen on @entity90 today including @entity92 geese ( pictured ) , of which there are more than 10,000 this led to nearly all the species of birds seen on @entity90 today , of which there are more than 10,000			0
in related studies , also reported in @entity74 , researchers compared the genomes of 48 bird species selected from all major avian groups , including the woodpecker , owl , penguin , hummingbird and flamingo			0
they discovered that birdsong evolved independently at least twice			0
birds were also found to have lost their teeth around 116 million years ago , when the dinosaurs still ruled			1
prehistoric crocodiles were able to run around like dogs to escape the jaws of predatory dinosaurs			0
this is according to a study published last year that showed , for the first time , how the reptiles evolved in a dinosaur dominated world			0
today , most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish , but their ancestors ran around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales			0
today , most modern crocodiles live in freshwater habitats and feed on mammals and fish			0
but their ancestors ( pictuerd ) were very different creatures , with some running around on land like dogs while others adapted to life in the open ocean , imitating the behaviour of whales the study , by @entity144 , revealed how the jaws of the ancient crocodiles evolved to enable the fierce animals to survive in vastly different environments			0
the team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the @entity157 - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years			2
the study revealed that ancient crocodiles invaded the @entity160 seas and evolved jaws built primarily for water efficiency to capture agile prey , such as fish			0
sample of jaws from the @entity157 crocodile record the research also found that variation peaked again in the @entity170 period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food			1
the research also found that variation peaked again in the @entity170 period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food			1
after the devastating end - triassic extinction event , crocodile ancestors invaded the seas and evolved jaws primarily built to efficiently swim in the water to catch agile prey such as fish			0
they also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the @entity170 - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs , including eating plants			1
surprisingly , the lower jaws of @entity170 crocodiles did not have a huge amount of variation			0
instead , the fossil record points towards novel adaptations in other areas of their anatomy , such as armadillo - like body armour .			0

@entity42 at @entity43 experts studied crocodile genes
they found the creatures have an unusually slow rate of genetic evolution
birds and crocodilians shared a common ancestor 240 million years ago
but while birds evolved quickly , crocodile *'s* bodies are almost the same
slow molecular clock allows experts to look at their past more clearly
