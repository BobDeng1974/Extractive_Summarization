@entity1 fans drooling at the prospect of @entity3 bringing a clutch of @entity6 players with him to @entity7 had their bubble burst on sunday , as a number of reported targets went missing against @entity11			1
the only players linked with a move to @entity1 that emerged with any credit in @entity15 were @entity16 , the former @entity18 attacker unusually employed at left wing - back by @entity3 , and centre - back @entity20			1
@entity42 , meanwhile , looked good moving out of defence with the ball but was shaky when dealing with @entity11 's vibrant attacking pair of @entity47 and @entity48			2
@entity6 were dealt an early blow as @entity50 was forced off through injury			2
the @entity25 player lasted just nine minutes before limping off to be replaced by another @entity1 target @entity54			2
@entity22 has been crucial for @entity6 at the last two @entity55 and his presence was missed in central areas , with @entity58 moving into midfield to take his place			2
in fact , @entity11 took the lead with a swerving shot from exactly the kind of area that @entity22 usually patrols			0
@entity48 pushed the ball away from blind 25 yards from goal and then smacked a shot into the bottom right corner with his left foot			0
game over : @entity22 was forced off by injury after just nine minutes of the game at @entity74 dogged defending : @entity16 performed well despite being played out of position at left wing - back @entity1 ’s search for centre - backs to replace @entity79 and @entity80 has been well documented			1
two of @entity6 ’s back - three against @entity11 , @entity82 and @entity42 , have been outlined as @entity3 targets , but neither impressed defensively against @entity85 ’s side			1
@entity1 are said to be hijacking @entity87 ’s move for @entity42 , while @entity82 is reported to have an offer on the table from @entity90			0
@entity82 was strong in the air but he struggled with the pace and directness of @entity95 and @entity47			0
header : @entity82 was strong in the air but not a lot else for an under - par @entity6 side pass - master : @entity42 's distribution was good but he looked less comfortable against @entity11 's pace in attack @entity42 was comfortable bringing the ball out of defence			1
on a number of occasions he nicked the ball from @entity11 ’s attackers , strolled forward and then played incisive passes towards @entity111 and @entity112			0
one of @entity6 ’s best chances in the game from a similar passage of play			0
@entity118 through the first half @entity42 waltzed over the halfway line and pinged a forward pass to @entity112			0
the @entity1 attacker controlled the ball brilliantly but his shot on the turn let him down , the ball flashing wide of @entity127 ’s goal			0
video @entity129 party rumbles on van the man : the @entity1 forward wasted a couple of chances and was replaced by @entity134 another @entity1 target , @entity30 , played no part against @entity11			1
@entity26 is reportedly keen on taking the right - back to @entity7 with him , but the @entity129 boss did not trust him to start in their last - 16 clash , instead picking @entity142 defender @entity141			1
@entity26 's team relied on some late magic from old - timers @entity145 and @entity111 to spare their blushes , the former lashing home from a corner and the latter winning the penalty that @entity134 slotted into the corner to put @entity6 through			1
water break : both teams were allowed a break to take on fluids in the first and second halves			0

@entity26 is taking over at @entity7 after @entity6 's @entity160 campaign in @entity161
@entity1 have been linked with moves for @entity54 , @entity50 , @entity20 , @entity30 and @entity16
despite looking impressive in the *group* stages @entity6 were poor against @entity11 and only a late penalty from @entity134 made it 2 - 1
