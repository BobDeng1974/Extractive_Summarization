@entity1 have n't got going tonight ( i was about to write a post about how @entity4 were 5 - 0 up at this point ) but @entity6 produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring			1
the ball bounces up to the @entity11 who unleashes a stunning left - footed volley , dipping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner at some speed			1
that was very @entity18 , if you do n't mind me saying			0
39mins : as bad as @entity1 have been , credit must go to @entity21			1
their work rate has been exceptional while they are passing and moving , not exactly looking like a side who are sitting just above the relegation zone			0
they have completed 184 passes so far today , which is a decent stat given it 's not even half time yet			0
31mins : but still , it 's the visitors who are getting in behind more than @entity1			1
there are a few whistles in the crowd , and that 's about the only atmosphere there is at this point			2
things may get better now though , it 's @entity43 time again with the dead ball ... but oh dear			0
that sums it all up , a limp effort rises way over the crossbar			0
@entity6 is clipped from 30 yards out and @entity43 is licking his lips			0
can he spark this game into life ? nearly ! a swerving effort from left to right , the keeper is beaten but the ball does n't quite dip in time and lands on the roof of the net			0
24mins : again , nice play from @entity21 ! @entity62 , on loan from @entity61 , shows his skills down the right before cutting the ball back for @entity66 , who fluffs his lines			2
definitely a half chance for the visitors			0
real need to wake up			0
19mins : considering the pace @entity4 were playing at last night this is pretty , er.			2
real have n't found their rhythm yet while @entity21 are just letting them pass from side to side			2
15mins : few more shots for the visitors , but they 're both from around 25 yards and @entity78 wo n't be worried by those			0
still , they 're getting forward while leaving enough men back to fend against what could be a devastating counter attack			0
12mins : better from @entity21			2
they 've won two out of their last three and are trying to bring some of that confidence into this one			0
some sloppy passing from @entity90 almost leads to a chance , as top scorer @entity92 looks to get on the end of a cross			2
7mins : three shots already for the hosts , with @entity43 having the latest two			0
no goals ? come on @entity43 ! first , he runs at the @entity21 defence but his left - footed strike is straight at the keeper who flicks it behind - and then from the resulting corner he rises highest but that 's ballooned over the bar			1
3mins : @entity21 have quite a bit of the ball early on but unsurprisingly it 's @entity1 who almost force the opening			1
@entity109 gets space down the left flank and his first time ball is just inches away from @entity43 at the back post			0
soon after @entity6 meets @entity115 's drilled cross from the right , but the goalkeeper can watch that one wide			0
ominous signs for the visitors with all this space early on though ... away we go ! @entity1 kicking from left to right in the first half			2
the sun is shining at the @entity125 , where @entity126 came out prior to kick - off to take a picture			1
minutes until kick - off now , @entity1 will be hoping to follow @entity4 's lead and turn on the style too			1
both sets of players wearing ' @entity135 ' t - shirts in support of the victims of the @entity139 earthquake , and there will also be a minute 's silence			0
under the terms set out by @entity143 when they loaned the 26 - year - old to @entity1 , thursday april 30 marks the end of the @entity148 club 's ' exclusivity period ' to buy the player			1
so , will he impress tonight ? @entity1 have scored 21 goals in their last four games against @entity21 , including an 8 - 1 victory at the @entity125 two years ago			1
@entity154 has made nine changes tonight with @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 dropping out , though there is still place for @entity43 and @entity109			2
and on that note ... @entity1 : @entity78 , @entity115 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity6 , @entity43 , @entity167 , @entity109 subs : @entity156 , @entity159 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity126 , @entity172 @entity21 : @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity62 , @entity66 , @entity179 , @entity92 , @entity180 subs : @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 referee : @entity190 it may only be a home clash against lowly @entity21 , but tonight could be the biggest night of a 16 - year - old 's life			1
@entity193 wonderkid @entity126 has been named on the bench for this evening 's @entity196 game and may make his debut			1
before that though , there is the small matter of @entity1 closing the gap on archrivals @entity4			1
pressure is on @entity1 as they aim to narrow the five - point gap @entity4 have opened up at the top of @entity196			1
@entity4 hammered @entity207 6 - 0 on tuesday to extend their lead at the @entity196 summit , but @entity1 will hope to reel in their rivals with victory over a struggling @entity21 team			1
@entity154 has named @entity126 on the @entity214 bench , with the 16 - year - old set to make his club debut at the @entity125 , so follow @entity218 's coverage of all the action here .			1

@entity126 may make @entity1 debut after being named in squad
@entity156 also on the bench for the @entity226 champions
@entity1 hope to narrow five point - gap to @entity4 at top of @entity196
clash against @entity21 at the @entity125 will kick off at *7pm*
