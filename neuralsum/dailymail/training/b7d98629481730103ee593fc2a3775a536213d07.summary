the curve of a person 's lower spine is unique , like a fingerprint , scientists say the age old advice to help people safely lift heavy objects - ' bend your knees and keep your back straight ' - is flawed , a group of scientists claim			1
new research by a team at @entity14 has found how a person should lift is determined by the shape of their spine			1
an individual 's curvature of the spine is unique , like a fingerprint , the study found			1
as such , a ' one size fits all ' approach to advising on how best to lift heavy objects is not effective , the scientists said			1
the new research suggests the mantra approach of ' bend your knees and keep your back straight ' , will not suit everyone			2
@entity32 , lead author of the study , said : ' the bones making up our lower back - the lumbar spine - form an inward curve that makes the hollow of our back			2
' some of us are more curvy than others			0
' what we showed was that the curve of our backs is specific to each individual , a bit like a fingerprint			1
' interestingly , this affects the way we life objects from the floor , so that those with ' curvy ' spines tend to bend over , or stoop , to lift a box whereas those with straighter spines tend to bend their knees and squat			2
' the study examined pain - free volunteers aged between 18 and 65			0
images of their spines were taken using mri scans in six postures ranging from leaning backwards to bending forwards , as if to touch their toes			0
a special computer method known as ' shape modelling ' was then used on each of the images to describe the shape of their lumbar spine , whether curvy or straight			1
the volunteers were then examined at a motion analysis laboratory , where special cameras were used to video them while they lifted a box , with weights inside it , from the floor in the way they found most comfortable			2
a weight that was ' moderately heavy ' was chosen by each person , varying from six to 15kg			2
researchers then compared how people with different spine shapes moved when lifting the box			0
professor @entity90 , said : ' our research showed that not only is the curve of our lower back specific to each individual but it also affects the way we lift objects from the floor			1
' the degree to which spines were curvy or straight correlated with whether the volunteers stooped or squatted to lift the objects from the floor			0
the team at the @entity14 studied pain - free volunteers , concluding that the age old advice of ' bend your knees and keep your back straight ' is flawed ' we 're clearly not all the same , so should guidelines be telling us to lift in the same way ? ' giving more attention to our individual spine shape could allow these guidelines to be better tailored to individuals			1
' back pain is costly to the @entity117 and employers			0
' it is common in manual occupations involving lifting and it can be devastating for the patient when they are no longer capable of performing their job			0
' understanding the mechanisms behind occupational back pain can allow for more appropriate prevention strategies			0
' dr @entity130 , from the @entity131 said : ' for many years we have ignored the fact that our spine are all slightly different and work in slightly different ways			0
' our research highlights these differences and paves the way for improving our understanding of what causes people to be injured when they lift and carry loads			0
' the paper was recently awarded the best paper at the annual meeting of the @entity148			0
the scientists said depending on whether a person has a curved or straight lumbar spine will dictate the best way for them to lift a heavy weight			1
those with curved spines found it more comfortable to bend over or stoop while people with straighter spines found bending the knees and lifting was most effective			1

scientists at the @entity14 found how a person should best lift is determined by the shape of their spine
an individual 's curvature of the spine is unique , like a fingerprint
so a ' one size fits all ' approach is not effective , scientists say
