a young woman suffers with a condition that causes her to experience extreme emotional reactions to certain textures			1
the unnamed 22 - year - old , known only as ' aw ' , was a patient of dr @entity5 , a leading neuroscientist based at the the @entity6 in @entity7			1
in a recent article , he and his colleagues have revealed details of the patient who found that touching denim left her depressed and disgusted while contact with silk made her happy and contented			2
disgusting : the woman referred to only as @entity17 feels depressed if she comes into contact with denim fabric touching corduroy left her confused , leather aroused feelings of receiving criticism , multi-coloured toothpaste made her feel anxious , wax made her feel embarrassed , paracetomol tablets left her feeling jealous and different grades of sandpaper made her feel either guilt , relief , or as if she was telling a white lie			1
synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight			2
another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters , shapes , numbers or people 's names with a sensory perception such as smell , colour or flavour			2
around four per cent of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women			2
most synesthesists tend to be left - handed			0
there are no dangerous side - effects to the having the condition famous synesthesists include @entity59 , @entity60 as well as the artists @entity61 and @entity63			0
after numerous tests , doctors concluded that @entity17 suffered from a brain condition known as synaesthesia in which one sense produces a reaction from another sense because pathways in the brain are muddled			0
to compare reactions , dr @entity5 and his colleague dr @entity73 then tested another 20 - year - old synesthesia suffer referred to as @entity77			1
@entity77 felt no real emotion when touching denim but was disgusted instead by the texture of fleece and wax			0
@entity83 made her feel disappointed ; bok choy made her feel irritated , but smooth metal made her feel sedated and calm			1
he reported : ' in this subject , the strongest emotion was evoked when she touched soft leather , which made her feel extremely scared – she described the sensation as “ making my spine crawl			0
” ' sandpaper makes the anonymous synesthesia patient feel either guilt , relief , or as if she was telling a white lie the scientists have reported in the journal @entity99 that the condition might have its roots in man 's evolution			1
they wrote : ' our primate ancestors may have evolved unconscious mechanisms for predicting the potential of an object to cause harm			0
' thus , tactile sensations which may be beneficial to survival ( such as soft furs , for example , which provide warmth ) may activate the parts of the limbic system mediating pleasure , whereas others which may be harmful ( such as jagged stones ) may be connected to those areas mediating aversion			0
