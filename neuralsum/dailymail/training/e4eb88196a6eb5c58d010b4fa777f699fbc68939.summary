by @entity0 in recent years we ’ve seen popular words on social networks make their way into the dictionary - from selfie to bitcoin			2
but now a new initiative will see @entity9 users decide for themselves what modern words they want to see included			1
@entity11 has scoured the microblogging site to find emerging words , and is asking users to vote on which should be added to the next edition of the dictionary			1
@entity9 users are being asked to vote on new words to enter the october 2014 edition of the @entity11			1
entries must be tweeted with a hashtag by 28 may and include words such as ' adorkable ' , which means a person who is ' dorky in an adorable way			1
' @entity27 image pictured lexicographers at @entity11 spent months scouring @entity9 to uncover the most popular terms being used , and have drawn up a shortlist			1
these include words such as ' adorkable ' , meaning dorky in an adorable way , to ' felfie ' – a farmer who has taken a selfie			2
the winning word will be announced in june and it will enter the october 2014 edition of the @entity11			1
to vote on a word , users need to tweet using a hashtag of their favourite word - such as # adorkable - by 28 may			1
and , according to the company ’s website , adorkable is currently in the lead , although there is plenty of time for it to change			0
@entity45 - dorky in an adorable way			0
@entity48 - the traditional ' pouting ' facial expression in selfies			0
@entity51 - the original @entity53 protests in @entity54 , named for @entity55 in @entity56			0

@entity69 - a selfie of a woman without her make - up , posted online to raise awareness for a charity ; the masculine equivalent is the makeupselfie			0
@entity77 - posting deliberately vague status updates on a social networking site with the intention of prompting a response			0
the company said using @entity9 to measure a word ’s popularity is a natural extension of the way the dictionary is compiled			1
words are usually added by analysing their usage across a range of @entity91 and international print and digital media			0
these are then collated into @entity11 ’ list of definitions , which currently stands at 4.5 billion			2
‘ @entity9 offers us an immediate snapshot of how much a word is used , ' said @entity100 , associate publishing director at @entity101			1
‘ the tried and tested approach to compiling dictionaries has to adapt to embrace the ways in which language is developing through use on social media , and this is a fun way to get @entity9 users involved in defining the @entity110 language			1
’ the company said using @entity9 to choose a new word is a natural evolution of the process usually used to select new words			1
@entity117 , for example , is a word growing in popularity used to describe someone who protests against fracking			0
stock image pictured @entity123 , lexicographer and consultant editor to the @entity11 , added : ' the words that we are asking @entity9 users to vote on have been selected from a group of words that were mostly submitted by the public for inclusion in the @entity11 via [ our website ]			1
' ' we then looked at the frequency of their usage by analysing the data held in the @entity11 corpus , which records word usage around the world in newspapers , magazines , tv , radio and online and is the data source we use to compile the dictionary			2
' they are all " bubbling under " words , in that we would not usually put them in the dictionary at this stage as they have not reached the required level of usage			0
' however , when we additionally used @entity9 data to look at their profile it was clear that there was a definite pattern of use on @entity9 and we could see where they originated from , and how their use has grown and spread geographically			2
' in this way , we are harnessing @entity9 data to detect and track word development at an early stage			2
' @entity123 added that language has always had to evolve to new developments in society , and this latest initiative is an indication of how important social media has become .			0
