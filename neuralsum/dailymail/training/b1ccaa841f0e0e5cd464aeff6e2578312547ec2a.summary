from diabetes smelling like nail polish remover to liver failure smelling of raw fish , doctors say diseases could eventually be diagnosed just using smell			1
they say that the breath of people with diabetes has been reported to smell of nail varnish remover , while that of those with liver disease can smell of raw fish			1
and even if the smell is too subtle to be detected by humans , it could soon be picked up by ‘ electronic noses ’			1
having diabetes can make a person 's breath smell of nail varnish remover , doctors have revealed the researchers , who published their findings in the journal sensors , also explain that a bladder infection can make the urine smell of ammonia and rubella can make the sweat smell of freshly plucked feathers			1
schizophrenia can make the sweat smell of vinegar and typhoid makes the skin smell like freshly baked bread , the @entity34 reports			1
finally , yellow fever can make the skin smell like a butcher 's shop and scrofula - a lymph node infection - can make a patient smell of stale beer			1
diabetes can make the breath smell of nail varnish remover			1
liver failure can make the breath smell of raw fish			1
a bladder infection can cause the patient 's urine to smell of ammonia			1
@entity58 can make the sweat smell of freshly plucked feathers			1
schizophrenia can make the sweat smell of vinegar			1
@entity63 makes the skin smell like freshly baked bread			2
yellow fever can make the skin smell like a butcher 's shop			1
@entity70 - a lymph node infection - can make a patient smell of stale beer			1
within the last week researchers have also discovered that machines can ‘ sniff out ’ breast cancer and that they are just as effective as a mammogram			0
one patient even claims that she was is able to detect the smell of cancer herself			2
@entity82 wrote on an online forum that when her husband was suffering from prostate cancer , and when she had lung cancer , she could smell decay			2
she says that the smell disappeared when the cancer was treated			2
seemingly , she is not alone – dr @entity89 at the @entity90 in @entity91 says he has heard numerous reports of patients noticing an unpleasant smell when around someone with cancer			2
dr @entity89 says he hopes this finding could lead to new ways to diagnose cancer earlier			0
he is particularly interested in ovarian cancer which is often not diagnosed until it is at an advanced stage			0
dr @entity89 says that the body produces chemicals as a result of normal metabolism but that cancerous cells metabolise differently meaning they emit different chemicals and cause a different smell			2
this is usually too subtle for humans to detect but dogs have been trained to diagnose cancer as well as diabetes			0
as a result , dr @entity89 is now collaborating with the @entity115 in a bid to teach dogs to sniff out ovarian cancer			0
the breath of people with liver failure sometimes smells of raw fish and having a bladder infection can cause the patient 's urine to smell like ammonia dr @entity89 says the four dogs receiving the training are able to detect the disease 90 per cent of the time			1
he hopes the dogs will help him to identify a unique ‘ odour signature ’ for the cancer			0
this would then allow him to programme an ‘ electronic nose ’ to detect the disease			2
dr @entity89 told the @entity34 : ‘ you can have the power of a dog 's nose on this small chip the size of your fingernail			0
it 's this device , rather than the dogs , that might end up on hospital wards			0
’ dogs , however , are not the only creatures that are able to detect cancer			0
scientists believe that fruit flies also have this ability			0
researchers at the @entity153 , in @entity154 , found the smell of cancer cells can cause a specific pattern of activity in the flies ’ antennae			0
the researchers hope they will eventually be able to grow their own antennae which they could use to detect disease			0
typhoid can makes the skin smell like freshly baked brown bread and schizophrenia can make a person 's sweat smell of vinegar another device is closer to hitting the market			1
tests on an ‘ electronic nose ’ called @entity175 revealed it can detect breast cancer in a patient ’s breath			1
the device can give results within 10 minutes and could prevent patients from having to be exposed to x-rays			0
it could save millions of women from painful mammograms			0
it is being tested at the @entity188 in @entity189 and could be available to doctors within just two years			0
at about the same time , another company , called @entity192 , is hoping to make available a device that can sniff out bowel cancer			0
having yellow fever can make a person 's skin smell like a butcher 's shop and scrofula - a lymph node infection - can make a patient smell of stale beer just a few weeks ago , researchers at the @entity204 , in @entity205 , discovered that humans can smell if someone 's immune system is highly active			1
they discovered that people can smell that the immune system has gone into overdrive within just a few hours of exposure to bacteria			0
the researchers injected a group of volunteers with a toxin that induced an immune response			0
they then asked them to wear tight t - shirts and discovered that when another group of people smelt these t - shirts , they thought the sweat had a more unpleasant smell than that from people whose immune systems were not in overdrive .			2

liver failure can make a person 's breath smell like raw fish
a bladder infection can make their urine smell of ammonia
@entity58 can make sweat smell like freshly plucked feathers
schizophrenia can make the patient 's sweat smell of vinegar
these scents could soon be picked up by ' electronic noses '
