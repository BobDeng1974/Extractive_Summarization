a volcano that erupted on the moon 3.5 billion years ago has been mapped in detail , showing it was much more explosive than thought			1
the research reveals that the eruption would have sent debris across an area the size of @entity10 on the lunar surface			1
and the team are going to use their same technique to map the eruption of the largest known volcano in the solar system : @entity17 on @entity18			1
research led by @entity20 studied a lunar volcanic eruption			1
the team found that the eruption was much bigger than was thought			1
it erupted 3.5 billion years ago ( illustration of @entity26 from around this time with the moon shown ) and covered a @entity10 - sized area in debris			1
this was thanks to the low gravity of the moon the findings were led by experts in the @entity36 and @entity37 at @entity20 , @entity38			1
they found that the eruption threw rock five times further than the flow of rock and gas that buried the @entity47 city of @entity48			2
although the moon was already known to be volcanically active during this time , the size and scale of this particular eruption was surprising			2
scientists believe there is a huge network of tunnels that exist beneath the lunar surface			0
the volcanic structures , known as ' lava tubes ' , have previously been proposed as sites for human colonies on the moon			2
now a study by @entity63 has claimed that tubes 0.6 miles ( 1km ) in diameter could be stable enough to house permanent bases beneath the surface			0
researchers believe that these lava tubes could help protect future astronauts against the challenges of the harsh lunar environment , which lacks a thick atmosphere			0
the volcano is located between two craters on the far side of the moon , @entity78 - which is 133 miles ( 214km ) wide - and @entity79 - which is 101 miles ( 162km ) wide			0
with the help of the moon 's low gravity , debris from the eruption spread over an area of 27,000 square miles ( 70,000 square kilometres )			1
@entity88 's @entity87 spacecraft first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity			0
since its discovery , the deposit had been hard to study because it is hidden beneath debris from meteorite impacts			0
but the @entity87 was also able to detect gamma rays emitted by the thorium that can pass through up to 3.3 feet ( one metre ) of rock			0
based on this information , the @entity99 - led team used a ' pixon ' image enhancement technique , originally designed to peer into the distant universe , to sharpen the map and reveal the enormous size of the thorium deposit from the volcanic eruption			1
in this artist 's impression , the red region is the volcanic complex , and measures 22 miles ( 35km ) in diameter			0
the green area shows where debris from the eruption went , spreading 185 miles ( 300km ) east @entity88 's @entity87 spacecraft ( illustrated ) first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity			1
the spacecraft was launched on 7 january 1998 , and remained in operation until 31 july 1999 this map of the @entity122 shows gamma - spectrometric data collected by @entity88 's @entity87 spacecraft , specifically thorium in surface rocks			0
on the left is the near side , and the right is the far side of the moon @entity132 , a phd student in @entity20 's @entity36 , said he was surprised by the gigantic scale of the explosion			2
' volcanoes were common in the early life of the moon and in fact the dark " seas " you can observe on the lunar surface were created by runny , iron - rich , lava that flooded large areas , filling in impact craters and low - lying ground , ' he said			1
' eruption of viscous , light - coloured , iron - poor , lava , which creates steep - sided volcanic cones , was rare and observed only at a handful of sites such as this one			2
' the explosive eruption of such lava is unknown elsewhere on the moon , making this volcano unique			0
' by mapping the radioactive content of the lava from this volcano we have been able to show that molten , radioactive rock was thrown far beyond the slopes of the volcano , reaching several hundred miles in one direction			0
' the research team is now planning to apply its mapping technique to the largest known volcano in the solar system , @entity17 on @entity18			1
rather than the radioactive element thorium , the researchers will be looking for hydrogen and the possible remnants of water ice from glaciers on the high slopes of the red planet			0
the volcano ( shown in red ) is located between two craters on the far side of the moon , @entity78 - which is 133 miles ( 214km ) wide - and @entity79 - which is 101 miles ( 162km ) wide shown is a picture of the far side of the moon taken by the @entity186 16 astronauts in 1972 , where the volcanic site of the huge eruption is located			2

research led by @entity20 studied a lunar volcanic eruption
the team found that the eruption was much bigger than was thought
it erupted 3.5 billion years ago and covered a @entity10 - sized area in debris
this was thanks to the low gravity of the moon
the same ' mapping ' technique will be used for @entity17 on @entity18
