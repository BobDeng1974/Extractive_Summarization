by @entity0 @entity2 ad man @entity1 has pulled off one of the internet 's greatest marketing stunts , designing a slick website to sell his beaten up old @entity6 for double what it 's worth			1
despite the car having clocked 188,000 kilometres and having dings on every panel , he 's attracted bids of more than $ 2000			2
the 15 - year - old vehicle once had its exhaust around in its boot for weeks before being reattached			0
the boss of advertising boss @entity18 , the company behind the stunt , says the ad is real but the sleek and impressive approach is just a complete ' piss take ' which parodies serious car commercials			1
' he has been trying to get rid of it , so he came in the other week telling me ' i 've got this car i 'm trying to sell			2
' ' it 's just a piss take of all the other generic car ads out there			2
' that has n't stopped people from entering bidding war though , where mr @entity1 is asking people to tweet him offers			1
and that 's where his silky selling skills have really come to the fore - with the car attracting offers of more than $ 2,000 , roughly double the estimated value of the 1999 model @entity77			1
but some of the more than 64,000 offers made for the vehicle have been every bit as creative as the ad itself			2
' there 's been some real trippers come in with offers ' , mr @entity54 said			1
' someone is offering 40 gallons of unicorn tears , another wants $ 7.31 for it , ' he said			0
' apparently there 's a man also willing to spend " $ 20 as well as sing a song "			0
' like i said , it is really just a piss take			0
' dented and out - dated : incredibly there has been offers of more than $ 2000 for the car which comes with only three hub caps one owner ? the car comes with fully - functional cd and @entity105 cassette player capabilities ... it 's even done only 188,000 kilometers , or there about write caption here he alleges he is the sole - owner of the @entity109 , a two - door hatchback designed by the former king of @entity114 motoring @entity112 , which recently announced it is ending its production line in @entity114			1
mr @entity54 gave his employee a $ 1000 budget to film the ad after he came to him with the idea , which is also part promotion for the company			1
the ad was filmed cruising across @entity2 's @entity121 and in the garage of the advertising office			2
the vehicle 's description on the website says it all : ' @entity127 , auto - @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130 and @entity132 wiper technology '			0
the @entity6 's driving capabilities are limited , but it can still motor between ' 0 - 60km ' as well as drive in ' reverse '			0
it even has manual transmission and if that 's not enough to motivate you to buy it , what about it 's ' @entity143 design ' ? so confident is mr @entity1 of selling it he put it on @entity146 , and it has reached close to 10,000 views in just two days			1
' i 'm trying to sell my awesome little car , ' mr @entity1 writes			1
' it 's a 1999 @entity6			0
its not in great condition , but its still a fun little car			0
tweet me an offer using the hashtag # buymybarina			0
i 've also set up a little site for it http://buymybarina.com			0
' there 's a an accelerator , break and clutch function which the driver has complete access too and control of part of the buss words mr @entity1 has used as the ' piss take ' to sell his car a very important part of every motor vehicle it 's hard to believe but apparently @entity1 is the sole owner of the 15 year model @entity26 the keys to the 15 - year - old @entity6 could be yours - if you successfully bid more than $ 2000 which is the current highest price			1

@entity1 created a web page and video to sell his 1999 used car
it 's a real advertisement ... but also a promotion for a *digital* advertising company
it is up for sale via @entity187 where people are tweeting their highest bids
his boss , @entity54 , said *bizarre* offers are flowing in for the @entity26
there has been some 64,000 people tweet in over two days
