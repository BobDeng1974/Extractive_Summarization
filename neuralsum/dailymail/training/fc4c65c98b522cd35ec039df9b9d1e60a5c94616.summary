by @entity0 more than one in five drivers say they have been penalised because they do not understand ' confusing ' parking signs more than one in five motorists have had their cars ticketed , clamped or towed away because of ‘ confusing ’ parking signs			1
some drivers avoid trying to park in areas where the signs are most prevalent , the poll by car insurers @entity12 found			1
more than four out of ten of the 2,001 people polled said parking signs in their area were confusing , while a third avoided parking in their local town or city centre for this very reason			1
almost one in ten even do n’t risk parking near their home because of confusing signs			1
more than a quarter say areas near their home have multiple restrictions in place on the same street and almost a third think signs in their local authority area do not clearly indicate to which area the restrictions refer			1
drivers avoiding parking in town centres due to sign confusion was most rife in @entity38 where nearly half of motorists admitted not even attempting to park in the heart of the @entity43 capital			1
the next most shunned town centres are in the north west of @entity47 , followed by the east of @entity47 and south east @entity47			2
@entity49 and north east @entity47 are the areas where motorists are most happy to attempt to park in town centres			0
the study says that overall a fifth of motorists have received a parking fine in the past two years as a result of not understanding the parking restrictions in that area			2
some one in 20 of those have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the same period , as a result of parking sign confusion			0
some drivers have endured one or more of these			0
clamping on private land was outlawed two years ago but is still legal in certain circumstances by local authorities , the government ’s @entity69 and bailiffs			0
in @entity38 alone last year some 8,273 cars were clamped on - street by local authorities , of which 8,167 were in @entity76 and @entity77 , which is also the biggest for car tow - aways at 6,524			0
@entity81 head @entity80 said : ‘ it ’s the driver ’s responsibility to check which parking restrictions are in operation in a particular area			2
‘ however , when there are multiple restrictions in operation on a single street , it can result in motorists being confused and unintentionally parking illegally , incurring fines that could have been avoided			2
’ the findings come in the week that ministers announced that the use of @entity98 ‘ spy cars ’ to catch people who park illegally is to be curtailed			0
they will no longer be allowed to routinely send out automatic tickets			0
some one in 20 have been clamped and one in 25 have had their vehicle towed away over the past two years as a result of parking confusion , according to a poll by insurers @entity12 instead parking wardens will instead have to fix tickets directly to windscreens , making it illegal for councils to issue penalties to drivers using just the @entity98 spy cars currently used for on - street parking enforcement			1
however , councils will still be able to use the cctv to issue postal tickets for any offences that occur on critical routes , such as those near schools and bus lanes , bus stops and on ' red routes '			0
the partial ban is being introduced following a three month to rein in ' over-zealous parking enforcement practices ' , which the government says has forced people to shop in out - of - town centres or online , and give motorists and local shops a ‘ fairer deal ’			1
ministers say the move will rein in ‘ greedy councils ’ who use the method of fining as a ‘ cash cow ’ , and bring to an end the “ plague ” of tickets being issued by post .			0
