@entity0 has long spoken of its ambition to make rockets reusable			1
and on monday , the firm plans to reach a major milestone as part of this endeavour when it brings back part of one of its @entity10 rockets after launch			1
if all goes to plan , the first stage of the rocket will gently lower itself and land on solid ground for the first time ever			1
@entity0 is planning to land a rocket at @entity18 on monday			1
the first stage of its @entity10 rocket will attempt to touch down on a barge ( illustration shown ) after launching a @entity22 into space			1
it is the first ever attempt at landing a rocket on solid ground after launch the attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo - carrying @entity22 to the @entity30 at 7.31pm gmt ( 2.31pm est ) on monday 16 december			1
the @entity10 rocket carrying @entity22 will take off from @entity32 ’s @entity18			1
after launch , at a height of about 56 miles ( 90km ) , the first stage of the rocket will separate from the second stage			2
while the latter continues its mission into orbit , the former would usually be left to fall back into the ocean - as is the case on all other rocket launches			0
however on this flight , for the first time ever , @entity0 will instead use a specially designed first stage capable of landing itself on a floating barge			1
in a previous flight , a @entity10 9 first stage hovered above the surface of the ocean - without a barge - in a successful demonstration of the technology			2
on that flight , the first stage was left to fall into the ocean after proving it could hover above the ground			0
but on this next flight , the rocket will touch down on a floating barge			2
the upgraded @entity10 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions private spaceflight company , @entity0 , successfully launched the first of its newly - improved @entity10 9 rockets in september			1
the nine - engine rocket is its most powerful to date and designed to test the viability of using fully reusable launch vehicles for future missions			2
currently , after delivering their payloads into orbit , booster rockets tumble back toward @entity76 and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea			0
this is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £ 280 million ( $ 440 million )			0
@entity0 , however , is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on @entity76 so they can be recovered and recycled			0
after september 's launch , three first - stage engines were reignited , to see if they could bring the first - stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact			0
another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water			0
' the most revolutionary thing about the new @entity10 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase , which is almost three - quarters of the cost of the rocket , ' said @entity0 ceo @entity98			1
the incredible attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo - carrying @entity22 to the @entity30 at 7.31pm gmt ( 2.31pm est ) on monday 16 december , from @entity32 ’s @entity18			1
pictured is a previous @entity10 launch on 14 july 2014 grid fins ( seen here ) on the side of the first stage of the rocket will keep it steady as it descends to @entity76 , while it will save 15 per cent of its initial fuel in order to lower itself slowly to the ground the barge measures about 300 feet ( 90 metres ) long by 100 feet ( 30 metres ) wide , and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet ( 50 metres )			1
according to @entity0 chief @entity98 , it also has ‘ thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs ’ that can hold it in position within 10 feet ( three metres ) even in a storm			2
to control the rocket as it lands , grid fins on its side are used , which control its pitch , yaw and roll			0
these are ‘ stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for “ x-wing ” [ from @entity134 ] style control , ’ according to @entity98			0
and to slow it down as it descends it will save 15 per cent of its original fuel , allowing it to lower itself towards the ocean without the use of a parachute			0
the barge ( shown ) measures about 300 feet ( 90 metres ) long by 100 feet ( 30 metres ) wide , and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet ( 50 metres ) however , as the mission has never been tried before , he added that there was only a 50 per cent chances of the platform landing being a success on this first attempt			2
whatever the outcome , though , @entity0 will use the data they glean to improve their technique and one day plan to perform this manoeuvre during every launch			0
cameras on board the barge will capture the entire descent , although it ’s unclear how much - if any - of this footage @entity0 will make public			0
eventually , they will start bringing the upper - or second - stage of the rocket back as well			0
the ultimate goal is to make the entire rocket reusable - which will drastically reduce the cost of going to space			0
@entity0 has a £ 1billion ( $ 1.6 billion ) contract with @entity174 to resupply the iss. this launch of the @entity22 will be the fifth of 12 scheduled missions			2
@entity98 ( pictured ) said the ambitious attempt has a 50 per cent chance of working			1
@entity0 ultimately wants all of its rockets to be reusable in order to reduce the cost of going to space			1
