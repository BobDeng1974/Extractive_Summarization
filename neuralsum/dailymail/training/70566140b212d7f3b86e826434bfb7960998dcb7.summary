a @entity3 state @entity1 candidate could be dumped just five days after being pre-selected after comments were published in which he appeared to warn female migrants about the risks of reporting domestic violence to police			1
@entity10 has the backing of @entity1 heavyweights for a seat in western @entity14 but his candidacy has been called into question over an article that appeared in the @entity18 in march 2012 , in which he said there was a misunderstanding among women who had recently arrived in @entity23 that police act as counsellors in domestic abuse cases			1
' for example , some wives think that they can call the police , and the police will come and warn their husbands not to be violent , but instead the police , when they come , arrest and charge them , ' mr @entity10 said			1
' this leads to a total breakdown of the family relationships			0
' newly endorsed @entity1 candidate @entity10 is facing a backlash over his comments on domestic violence mr @entity10 , a solicitor and barrister , is part of the @entity43 in @entity14 's western suburbs , a community - based legal centre which provides free legal advice and information ' to those who can not afford to pay private lawyers and for those who do not know where to go when they encounter a legal problem '			1
at first mr @entity10 called the matter ' just a storm in a tea cup ' and refused to recant the views he expressed in the article			1
but on monday , he told @entity59 that ' my position is that domestic violence is not acceptable under any circumstances '			2
' it 's just that for some communities we need better education about the role of police and how they act in terms of domestic violence , ' he said			2
' people should report domestic violence to police , no ifs or buts , but sometimes they are told they should not have called them about an argument and then it is too late to make alterations			1
' advocacy groups say @entity14 has one of the country 's worst rates of domestic violence his reported views have caused dismay within his own party and anti-domestic violence campaigners			1
mr @entity10 's pre-selection for the seat vacated by former @entity3 premier @entity92 was backed by @entity1 heavyweights including federal mps @entity94 and @entity96 , and @entity98 mp @entity97 , who come from the party 's @entity99			1
mr @entity101 , however , remains a staunch supporter despite the controversy			0
' it 's true that some cultural differences do not translate here and i do n't agree with some of the comments he made , ' mr @entity101 said			1
' yes he could have chosen his words a bit better but while he said them ( the words ) he definitely would not practice those things himself			0
' this is just an internal agenda issue - all part of a smear campaign by his detractors but he has been re-endorsed by the executive			0
' he has very strong support within the rank and file			0
' mr @entity10 was pre-selected unopposed for the seat but has yet to be formally advised of his endorsement			1
he expects that to occur within the next day			0
' with any political party , there are some people who vote for me , some who wo n't - that 's the nature of the business , some love you and some hate you , ' he said			2
' there was the chance for others to nominate but i was the only one			0
it has been a four - month process and the party has come to the conclusion that i should be endorsed			0
' there are people in the party who would n't like me to be the candidate			2
' @entity143 from @entity144 and @entity145 says mr @entity10 's comments are ' out of step with the rest of the community ' @entity1 sources have confirmed that his candidature has gone before both the internal @entity152 and an @entity153 and they say he would have been axed had he not had the support of some of the country 's most influential @entity1 politicians			1
a party insider has told @entity59 : ' just about everyone in the party agrees this ( his pre-selection ) is not a good idea			0
' several senior party members have made it clear they are very uncomfortable with his pre-selection on the basis of his views and want to get rid of him somehow without upsetting those who backed him in			2
' @entity143 from @entity144 and @entity145 said his comments ' are not in keeping with the views of the majority of his party colleagues '			0
' more particularly though these views are totally out of step with the broader community			0
' he obviously does not understand it is quite simply a criminal act , there is no excuse for domestic violence			2
' what is of most concern is that he is seeking to represent an area which suffers some of the highest levels of domestic violence in this country , ' she said			1
this controversy comes just a week after drama gripped @entity191 politics			0
@entity193 member @entity192 was forced to resign from his seat in @entity195 after racist and sexist comments posted on social media were brought to light , while @entity199 stepped out of the running for @entity200 after homophobic comments on @entity202 posted by the endorsed candidate were discovered .			0

comments made by @entity10 in 2012 have put his pre-selection for a @entity3 state seat in jeopardy
he said cultural differences create problems when reporting domestic violence to police
anti-domestic violence campaigners say his comments are completely out of order in an area with high levels of abuse
mr @entity10 claims ' there are people within the party who do n't want me '
his pre-selection was backed by @entity1 heavyweights like federal mps @entity94 and @entity96 and @entity3 mp @entity97
