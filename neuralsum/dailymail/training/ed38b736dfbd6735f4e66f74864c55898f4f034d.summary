by @entity0 for @entity1 a pill to prevent jet lag may be in sight after scientists discovered the gene that causes the condition			1
the gene , @entity10 , controls waking and sleeping patterns and could also help control dementia , sleep disorders and help shift workers , researchers claim			1
every cell in the body has a ' clock ' - an abundance of proteins that dip or rise rhythmically over approximately 24 hours			0
scientists have discovered the gene that causes the jet lag , paving the way for a pill to treat it the master clock responsible for establishing these rhythms and keeping all the body ’s cells in sync is the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( @entity30 )			1
this is a small , densely packed region of about 20,000 neurons housed in the brain ’s hypothalamus			0
and these neurons are in close and constant communication with one another , more so than other areas of the brain , say the @entity41 authors of the new study			0
the close interaction , combined with exposure to light and darkness through vision circuits , keeps this master clock in sync and allows people to stay on essentially the same schedule every day			0
however this tight coupling of the cells also helps make them collectively resistant to change			0
exposure to light that resets less than half of the @entity30 cells , resulting in long periods of jet lag			1
in the new study , researchers at the @entity61 disrupted the light - dark cycles in mice			1
using the mouse - version of jet lag - an 8 - hour shift in their day - night cycle - the scientists found that those with little or no @entity70 readjusted much faster to the shift in pattern than normal mice			1
this suggests that because these neurons are less in sync with one another , they are more easily able to shift to a new schedule , though it is difficult for them to maintain that schedule			2
the gene , @entity10 , controls waking and sleeping patterns and could also help control dementia and sleep disorders and researchers also found that these mice also exhibited reduced activity of certain genes , including one that creates vasoactive intestinal peptide ( @entity94 ) a molecule that has important roles in development and as a hormone in the intestine and blood			1
in the brain , @entity94 affects cell communication , but nobody had known that @entity10 regulated it until now , said study author professor @entity105 the team also found that adding @entity94 restored cell synchrony in the master clock responsible for establishing these rhythms and keeping all the body ’s cells in sync			2
prof @entity105 added : ' this approach helped us to close that knowledge gap and show that @entity94 is a very important protein , at least for the suprachiasmatic nucleus			0
it can compensate for the loss of @entity10			2
' cutting back on the peptitde could also be another way to treat jet lag			1
in fact , it could be an even easier drug target compared with @entity10 , because @entity94 is secreted from cells rather than inside cells , professor @entity105 said			2
he added : ' if we find a drug that will block the @entity94 receptor or somehow break down @entity94 , then maybe that will help us reset the clock much faster			0
' such treatments could also help people suffering from dementia - thought to be made worse by sleep problems			2
' it ’s possible that the severity of many dementias comes from sleep disturbances , ' explained professor @entity105			0
' if we can restore normal sleep , we can address half of the problem			0

the gene , @entity10 , controls waking and sleeping patterns , say @entity148 researchers
mice with little or no @entity10 readjusted much faster to jet lag conditions
pill could also help sleep disorders , dementia *patients* and shift workers
