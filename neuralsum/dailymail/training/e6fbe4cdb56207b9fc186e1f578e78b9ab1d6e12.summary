sunbathers bask in the heat , while a young boy plays paddleball with a friend			0
but just yards from the swimmers enjoying the sunshine the body of an elderly tourist lies dead on the sand			0
the lifeless cadaver of the 78 - year - old @entity17 woman lying near the waves is treated with total indifference			1
left on the sand : the body of the woman is ignored as a child paddles and a man plays bat and ball a white sheet shields her skin and face from the public , but even those who have a good view of the body barely bat an eyelid			1
the alert was raised when two women noticed the woman â€™s collapsed body in the shallow water on monday , @entity37 news agency @entity36 said			1
but after the initial shock the cheerful beachgoers paid no attention to the tragic scene , apparently unmoved by the grisly sight at @entity48 , half way between @entity1 and @entity50			2
in august 2011 @entity37 was left shocked after the body of a 67 - year - old , who died on a beach towel under an umbrella , lay undiscovered for three hours , surrounded by beach - goers , on a beach near @entity58			1
the body remained on the beach while tourists nearby joked and sunbathed			1
two women sounded the alarm when they noticed the body of the woman in the surf			2
but the swimmers and sunbathers did n't let it prevent them from having fun and in 2008 photographs emerged of beach - goers happily sunbathing near the dead bodies of two gypsy girls on a beach in @entity50			2
the victims - aged 14 and 16 - had reportedly been with two other young girls begging from tourists on the beach , and then went into the water despite none of them apparently knowing how to swim			1
they soon got into trouble because of strong currently and were hit by a large wave , witnesses said			0
two of the girls were rescued by the lifesavers , but the other two could not be saved in time			0
their bodies were taken ashore and laid on the sand under towels			0
but witnesses said few people on the beach left their area or stopped sunbathing - and the bodies were later carried away by police .			0
