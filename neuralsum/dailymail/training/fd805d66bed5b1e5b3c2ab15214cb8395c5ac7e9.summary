by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s players risk being struck down with sickness ahead of their @entity6 opener against @entity7 having begun a course of medication to prevent malaria			1
the 23 - man squad will take tablets for 12 days in a bid to combat the disease , which is particularly prevalent in the north of @entity16 and in @entity17 where the @entity3 kick off their campaign on saturday			2
but the antimalarial drug @entity20 causes side effects which include diarrhoea , nausea , vomiting , stomach pain and headaches			2
and with one in 10 people usually affected , there is a danger that some of @entity31 ’s men could take ill over the coming days			0
risk : one in ten people who take anti-malaria tablets are affected by sickness prevention : @entity3 's players began their 12 - day course of tablets on tuesday very common : more than 1 in 10 people who take @entity20 - diarrhoea - headaches - nausea - stomach pain - vomiting common : more than 1 in 100 people who take @entity20 - abnormal laboratory test results - allergic reactions including anaphylactic reactions - blood problems - cough - depression - difficulty sleeping - feeling dizzy - fever - itching - loss of appetite - metabolic problems - skin rash or rashes - strange dreams uncommon : more than 1 in 1000 people who take @entity20 - feeling anxious - hair loss - inflammation of the mouth - palpitations - urticaria rare : more than 1 in 10,000 people who take @entity20 - hallucination no choice : @entity31 accepts his players must take the medication the @entity3 boss , however , would rather his players suffered the side effects than contract malaria			1
‘ it ’s a question for the doctors really : i went to @entity17 and i did n’t take any for the two days i spent there , ’ said @entity31 , whose staff will also take the medication			0
‘ that might just be something to do with the fact that i ’m not a football player			0
as far as i ’m concerned , i ’ve got to go with medical opinion			0
' if the doctors are telling me that , when we go to @entity17 , the players must take malaria tablets , whether it has side effects or not , what do i do ? ' i ca n’t turn around and say : “ we will not take malaria tablets ” because the bottom line is it ’s better to have stomach cramps or whatever it is for one player in 10 than have someone contract malaria , because that would be unthinkable			1
