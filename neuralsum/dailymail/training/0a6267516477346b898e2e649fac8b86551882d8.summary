the difference is , 100 years ago , @entity90 went to war			2
i could see that as he and his dad @entity93 walked the trenches and looked up at the cliffs from @entity19 … @entity32 suddenly understood what it must have been like			0
@entity23 snr was in the second wave of @entity29 to hit the shore on april 25th , 1915 and even as he and his mates saw the diggers in front of them being mowed down … they still ran forward			2

but in what was an extraordinary act of courage , he survived with the help of a schoolmate			0
@entity42 had not seen his schoolmate since kindergarten , but out here in the battlefield now littered with bodies … he recognised @entity23 and for the next five hours , dodging bullets , helped carry him back down to the beach to safety			0
it is a story that strikes a very emotional chord			0
like all of us , 21 - year - old @entity23 and his dad , @entity93 , are in awe of the friendship and bravery displayed that day			2

the very best and very worst took place at @entity37			0
as i walked amongst the bodies now buried in cemetery after cemetery i could n’t help but feel terribly sad			0
