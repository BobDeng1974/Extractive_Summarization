the @entity0 is under pressure to drop its right to bring prosecutions after it spent £ 22.5 million on prosecutions over two years			1
the cost includes £ 10 million for vets fees and taking care of animals during the prosecution process			2
the rest covers legal fees , administration and expert witness costs			0
an independent review that uncovered the cost also showed that the @entity0 has been paying excessive legal fees			1
lawyers were paid up to £ 1,200 a day in some cases – higher than the amounts paid to state prosecutors in child cruelty cases			1
in the doghouse : the @entity0 spent £ 22.5 million on legal bills over two years and have been spending excessive amounts on legal fees the review was undertaken by @entity27 , a former chief inspector of the @entity28			1
he was asked by the charity to examine its prosecution policy after several controversial cases , including £ 326,000 spent on one against the @entity33 hunt in @entity35 ’s constituency			1
although the case was successful , the judge suggested the public might feel the cash ‘ can be more usefully employed ’			0
a key recommendation of the report is for the @entity0 to pass cases straight to the police and the @entity28 , rather than bringing their own prosecutions			2
but , two days after the review was published , the charity launched a prosecution against the @entity50 hunt in @entity51			0
on october 3 , a summons was served to @entity53 , joint master and huntsman , to appear in court later this month			0
in court : the @entity50 hunt in @entity51 @entity27 ’s report found that typical @entity0 payments were £ 90 to £ 190 an hour for a solicitor to bring a case in the magistrates court , where a day is up to five - and - a - half hours , at a total of £ 495 to £ 1,045			1
this excludes hours spent in preparation			0
by contrast , a @entity66 ( @entity28 ) lawyer is paid from £ 200 to £ 250 a day , and this includes preparation time			1
fees were even more generous for barristers hired by the @entity0 , with typical payments of £ 800 to £ 1,200 a day			1
a shocked mr @entity27 said the cases in question would not qualify for the @entity28 rate for a category b offence – a category that includes child cruelty			0
in such cases @entity28 lawyers would be paid £ 1,000 for preparation and one day in court , plus £ 480 a day for the rest of the trial			1
fees paid by the @entity0 to lawyers accounted for more than £ 8 million of the charity ’s legal costs in 2012 and 2013			1
mr @entity27 declined to make further comment but told @entity89 he stood by his report			0
sir @entity91 , conservative mp and former solicitor - general , said : ‘ i would like to see the @entity0 reporting offences to the police rather than deciding to investigate and prosecute themselves			2
when you see the potential for vast differentials in legal charges , that sense of unfairness is apparent			0
where is the equality of arms ? ’ @entity105 , a barrister who has defended hundreds of people prosecuted by the charity , said : ‘ the @entity0 ’s largesse provides strong financial incentives to advise prosecution in cases which the @entity28 would never touch			2
i ’ve had cases where @entity0 prosecutors have been on more than ten times my fees			0
’ @entity115 , @entity116 director of campaigns , said : ‘ charities have a duty a duty to spend donations prudently , but the @entity0 ’s prosecution operation is profligate			0
it would be far better if the @entity0 left prosecution to the @entity28 , like every other charity			0
’ the @entity124 will meet @entity0 chiefs to discuss the findings and an @entity0 spokesman last night confirmed that its legal fees are to be scrutinised			2
the report coincides with a turbulent period for the @entity0 which has lost £ 7 million in donations from supporters incensed by its contentious campaigns			1
mr @entity27 ’s six - month review is estimated to have cost up to £ 50,000 .			0

the @entity0 spent £ 22.5 million on legal bills over two years
more than £ *325,000* was spent on case against the @entity33 hunt
barristers hired by the @entity0 were paid £ 800 to £ 1,200 a day
