by @entity0 last updated at 11:16 pm on 31st january 2012 two former @entity2 ball boys filed a suit saying that both the wife of the team 's former assistant coach @entity5 and another coach ’s wife regularly had sex with players			1
accuser @entity11 , 40 , has previously said that @entity12 initiated sex with him when he was 18 years old , but in the latest court filing , he goes a step further and says that it was well - known that she had sex with a number of basketball players while her husband worked as one of their coaches			1
she was also heard talking with the wives of other assistant coaches about performing oral sex on the boys , as well as evaluating their ' specific size and physical attributes '			0
telling it all : @entity11 ( right ) recorded his conversation with @entity12 ( left ) when she said that she knew @entity5 molested boys but she did n't do anything , and @entity11 just detailed her sexual history in the affidavit mr @entity11 details a number of mrs @entity12 ’s affairs with the students in an effort to show that it was commonly known that players were sleeping with the coaches ’ wives throughout @entity44 ’s tenure as head coach			1
apparently mrs @entity12 's relationships evolved in a similar pattern with each young man , as she would begin by paying them special attention and doing them favors like washing their laundry or lending them her car			2
she also gave them money and jewellery , and turned their special bond into ' an intimate relationship '			0
mr @entity11 tells the specific stories of mrs @entity12 ’s trysts with four unidentified players - not including his own personal sexual encounter with her - in which he would drive @entity12 to the players ’ campus housing units			2
in the first assignation listed in the affidavit , mr @entity11 drove mrs @entity12 to @entity72 ’s house and he saw her go into his dorm room			0
mr @entity11 ‘ later saw @entity74 come out fist - pumping the air and bragging about how he had just had sex with @entity12			0
’ fired : @entity5 was fired in november after recordings were released that said he molested a number of his former players this is just the first of four specific relationships that @entity11 describes in the affidavit , and he says it was common knowledge that the coaches wives were not off - limits for the basketball players			1
' players used to joke openly about it as a known fact - that @entity12 gave ( good oral sex ) and was great in bed , and that anyone could ' do the coach 's wife , ’ the @entity88 reports regarding the affidavit			1
mr @entity11 ‘ later saw @entity74 come out fist - pumping the air and bragging about how he had just had sex with @entity12 ’ - according to the affidavit mr @entity11 continues by saying how often he would drove mrs @entity12 and another - unidentified - coaches ’ wife to a student housing unit where at least two players lived , who are called @entity107 and @entity108 in the court records			1
during the car rides , the two women discussed different players ’ sexual preferences , and evaluated their respective partner ’s physical attributes			0
though mr @entity11 never explicitly knew that mrs @entity12 had a sexual relationship with the final young man , @entity117 4 , though he believes that she did ‘ because of the way she acted with him ’			0
in spite of all the focus on mrs fine in the filing , the true target of the lawsuit is coach @entity44			0
the drama started when assistant coach @entity5 , 66 , was fired in november after @entity127 released a taped conversation it had obtained between mr @entity11 and @entity12 in which @entity12 said that she knew that her husband molested his players but she did not do anything about it			1
drawn in : the lawsuit charges @entity2 head coach @entity44 ( pictured ) with defaming @entity5 's accusers by calling them money - seeking liars the two accusers in this suit - mr @entity11 and his stepbrother @entity138 - say they were forcibly touched multiple by @entity5 in the 1980s			1
@entity2 administrators immediately fired @entity5 in november after @entity127 released the nearly decade - old tapes , but mr @entity44 publicly defended his former assistant , saying that his accusers were liars and simply bringing the topic up to make money			1
' players used to joke openly about it as a known fact - that @entity12 gave ( good oral sex ) and was great in bed , and that anyone could ' do the coach 's wife , ’ - according to the affidavit ' i believe @entity44 deliberately chose to ignore what he knew was improper behavior , or actually knew precisely what was happening and did nothing to intervene , ' mr @entity11 writes in the affidavit			1
by bringing the widespread nature of the rumors about @entity12 's sexual activities with players into the legal field , the accusers are undoubtedly hoping to discredit mr @entity44 's defense that he did not know about the sexual abuse that was going on			1
because mr @entity11 and all of the other players mentioned were 18 years old when they had sex with @entity12 , she can not be accused of statutory rape			2
' it is not only @entity12 ’s relationship with me and other boys that would have tipped @entity44 off			0
for years , @entity5 ’s wife @entity12 had sexual relationships with basketball team players			2
players used to talk openly about it as a known fact , ' the affidavit continues			0
new focus : her husband was the original focus of the police investigation , as they are seen going through @entity5 's bags , but now the relationship @entity12 ( left ) had with players is cause for concern another controversy surrounding the suit is the location of the inevitable trial			2
@entity197 , the lawyer for the accusers - mr @entity11 and his stepbrother @entity199 - filed the defamation suit in @entity201 which is in @entity202			0
mr @entity44 wants the trial to take place in @entity205 upstate , which is where he lives			0
the accusers fear that there is too much support for the @entity2 coaches there and if the trial were to take place in the school 's backyard , they feel they would not be given equal treatment .			0
