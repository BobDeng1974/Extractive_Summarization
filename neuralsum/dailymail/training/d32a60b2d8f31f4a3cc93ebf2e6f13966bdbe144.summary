mr @entity13 said his opponents risk taking @entity19 back to a time of ‘ war and trenches ’			1
prime minister @entity3 , pictured in @entity24 today , hit back at the extraordinary remarks by @entity5 president @entity13 despite being a supposedly neutral public servant , mr @entity13 – a former prime minister of @entity28 – suggested @entity16 would beat the @entity17 in next year ’s @entity30 elections because ‘ when it comes to being against @entity19 , people prefer the original to the copy ’			1
but mr @entity3 said the president had gone beyond his remit and must respect one of the leading parties in @entity30			2
speaking on @entity38 , the prime minister said : ‘ the @entity13 thing did annoy me because frankly , his job is to serve the members of the @entity42 and the @entity44 conservatives in the @entity30 are an important party			1
‘ they are the governing party of the @entity44 and he should be respecting their views rather than trying to lecture them			2
‘ they ’ve got an important contribution to make and i think he got it wrong , and i ’ll tell him that			0
’ mr @entity3 , who met entrepreneurs including @entity54 , right , mad clear his anger at the attack on @entity57 ' let me say this to all those who rejoice in @entity19 ’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation - the pre-integrated @entity19 of the divisions , the war , the trenches , is not what people desire and deserve			1
‘ the @entity19 continent has never in its history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the @entity77			1
it is our duty to preserve it and deepen it			0
to @entity17 mep @entity81 : ‘ your party is looking like @entity16			0
@entity16 may finish first in @entity44			0
' i have some doubts whether you are going to be elected in @entity44 or if it is not @entity16 that will be the first force in @entity44 elections			0
‘ because when it comes to be against @entity19 people prefer the original to the copy			1
‘ that is probably why they are going to vote for ( @entity93 ) @entity92			0
i do n’t say this with any kind of satisfaction			0
' he said that while he has a ‘ good relationship ’ with mr @entity13 he plans a ‘ pretty robust exchange ’ on the issue the next time he sees him			1
mr @entity13 ’s comments came in his annual address to the @entity30			2
in a thinly veiled attack on mr @entity3 , he insisted @entity19 needed ‘ more integration ’ , not less			2
he said : ‘ let me say this to all those who rejoice in @entity19 ’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation – the pre-integrated @entity19 of the divisions , the war , the trenches , is not what people desire and deserve			1
‘ the @entity19 continent has never in its history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the @entity77			2
it is our duty to preserve it and deepen it			0
’ in exchanges with @entity81 , the @entity17 leader in the @entity30 , mr @entity13 said : ‘ your party is looking like @entity16			2
‘ @entity16 may finish first in @entity44			0
i have some doubts whether you are going to be elected or if it is not @entity16 that will be the first force in @entity44 elections			0

’ mr @entity81 last night condemned the intervention as ‘ outrageous ’ , adding : ‘ he is effectively a civil servant , but he has turned it into an increasingly political role			0
‘ the idea that the alternative to greater @entity42 integration is a return to us fighting each other in the trenches of the @entity8 is just risible			1
‘ @entity3 has got him rattled			0
he thought he could isolate @entity44 , but there is growing support for the prime minister ’s ideas in @entity147 , the @entity148 and others			1

@entity13 said @entity57 could lead to divisions that *sparked* the @entity8
said people do not ' desire or deserve ' return to pre-integrated @entity19
but the prime minister said he was ' annoyed ' at the extraordinary *criticism*
