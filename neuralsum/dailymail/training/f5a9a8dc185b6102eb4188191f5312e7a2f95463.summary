@entity0 believes he now has the psychological edge over @entity2 after putting daylight between himself and the @entity4 in this season 's @entity6 title race			1
in a championship game of swings and roundabouts between the @entity17 team - mates , @entity2 's burst of four consecutive wins after @entity0 's triumph in the season opener in @entity12 , allowed him to finally edge ahead in the drivers ' standings			1
but events over the last two grands prix in @entity22 and @entity23 have conspired against @entity2 , leaving @entity0 to open up a 22 - point cushion going into this weekend 's return to @entity26 after an 11 - year absence			1
feeling positive : @entity0 believes he has the edge over team - mate @entity2 in the race for the title with @entity0 now in the ascendancy , the 28 - year - old @entity31 said : ' if your team - mate has three or four wins in a row that 's obviously going to strengthen his position			1
' so it was really important to bring that run to an end because psychology is a big part of sports			2
' if you have those results behind you , like i do now , it gives you that little bit extra , that little bit of an edge , so it does help			0
' @entity0 can also count on lady luck being on his side last time out in @entity23 after both he and @entity2 suffered identical issues with one of the car 's two energy recovery systems			1
battling it out : @entity0 , left , and @entity17 team - mate @entity2 , right whereas @entity2 was forced to retire , @entity0 managed to nurse his through severe difficulties before claiming second place behind debut race - winner @entity63 in his @entity65			1
@entity0 added : ' in hindsight it was damage limitation in @entity23 , coming second , lots of points			2
i could look back and say it was still a decent day			0
' for the team it sucked because our ambition is to do much better			0
with reliability problems like that , it 's not good			0
we need to be bulletproof			0
' it 's a work in progress			0
we 've been good with reliability , but we have had a few problems now , so we have to keep on going and make sure it 's 100 per cent , but of course it 's never easy			0
' sharing the podium : @entity0 , @entity2 and @entity63 after recent race in @entity22 the issues in @entity23 ended @entity17 ' run of six consecutive victories and five successive one - twos , as well as talk of a team going through an entire season unbeaten for the first time in @entity6 's history			1
' that 's not good , ' said @entity0			2
' it sucks because our car is fast enough to win every race , so coming away from @entity23 without the win was a big disappointment for our team			2
' we need to bounce back in @entity26 and finish one - two in every race given the car we have			0
