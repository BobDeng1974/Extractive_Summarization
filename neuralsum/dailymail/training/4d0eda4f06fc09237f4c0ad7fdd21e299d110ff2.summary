dear @entity1 fans , in my very first column of the season , i wrote that i feared for your team			1
i was worried that the inconsistencies of the previous campaign , the quality of the performances and the value of the summer signings meant you would flirt with relegation and i predicted you would finish fourth from bottom			0
after all the stick i got over the years at @entity16 i find it very hard to apologise to any @entity1 fan but , i am happy to admit just this once , that i was wrong about your team			1
hitting form : @entity1 's run of four wins in february saved them from relegation by sunday night @entity1 will still be in the @entity23 and comfortably clear of the relegation zone			1
i could not see that happening at the start of the season			0
the club and @entity28 have proved me wrong			1
even though his imminent sacking may not come as a surprise , it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty from the @entity1 board			1
what kind of message does it send to a prospective new manager when you ditch a man who has achieved everything asked of him ? at times the football has not been pretty but @entity28 masterminded three big wins over @entity45 and a crucial 0 - 0 draw at @entity47			1
that result sent @entity1 on a four - match winning streak — their first in seven years — and was the run that saved their season and kept them up			2
it is admirable @entity28 got the chance to see things through , especially with other clubs sacking managers for fun — the bottom three have had seven between them this season – and he has managed in a bullish manner throughout			2
on his way : @entity28 is understood to be nearing an exit from @entity16 they have survived quite comfortably in the end , but there have been problems			1
@entity67 , who @entity28 signed for record money , has scored only twice and his injury saga was a real concern			2
the away form has barely improved since last season , either			0
but @entity28 is a troubleshooter , the kind of man clubs turn to for a quick fix			2
now @entity1 ’s problem of survival has been solved , the fans and the club are ready for a change			1
@entity28 will feel aggrieved he lost his job over the brand of football rather than results , but all is not lost			1
@entity87 was sacked by @entity88 in similar circumstances but has evolved and enhanced his reputation with @entity91			0
if this is the end for @entity28 , he can easily do the same thing at another top club			1
@entity1 fans are purists and want their team to play with flair , but we have not seen that for a few generations and any transition will not happen overnight			2
out ! @entity1 fans let their frustration out on the manager after defeat to @entity104 the team are set up for @entity106 and @entity107 to find @entity67 with crosses			0
the new boss will have to make the most of the players he has , making tweaks to the way they play rather having a radical overhaul			0
for all the desire to play more attractive football , sacking @entity28 is a huge gamble			1
the club will want to be a @entity23 side when they move into the @entity121 in 2016 and @entity28 could have provided that stability			1
he achieved all that was asked and usually in business if you meet your objectives , you keep your job			0
but for @entity1 fans football is an entertainment business and they do not feel entertained			1
it is not a decision that will be taken lightly , but when @entity28 was booed by his own fans , it was @entity135			0
it was never an easy relationship but now it ’s up to the board to find a new man who fits the bill			0
fresh new start : a new manager could drive @entity1 up the league next season in the spotlight : @entity146 , @entity147 30 , @entity148 he may not be the most original pick for @entity150 but when @entity146 said he did not receive enough recognition earlier this season , i could not agree more			1
there is a lot of talk at the moment about the development of young @entity160 players but any youngster will only take inspiration from what @entity146 is doing on and off the pitch			0
he is one of the most humble people i ’ve met in football , he is a team player first and foremost and his individual ability is unquestioned			0
underrated : @entity146 has not received the praise he deserves after another superb season it is rare to find a player who so perfectly mixes pace , power and technique			2
he can finish like a forward and defend like a centre half , as he proved for @entity177 in the @entity179 final			0
if @entity148 are struggling to score on sunday , it will probably be @entity146 who pops up with a winner			2
if he keeps it up i might say he is better than my old team - mate @entity184			0
but he ’s still got some work to do to match the fantastic @entity186 .			0

the club and @entity28 have proved me wrong , it shows a disappointing lack of loyalty to sack @entity28
by sunday night @entity1 will be comfortably clear from relegation
the football has not always been pretty , but he masterminded huge wins
@entity146 does not get the recognition he deserves in the @entity23
