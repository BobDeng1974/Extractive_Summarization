it is still thought of as a chance for women to show off their good taste in fashion			0
so more than a few racegoers got the needle yesterday when @entity7 turned up for ladies ’ day at @entity10 all - over tattoos			1
while other women donned expensive gowns and chic headwear , @entity11 , 25 , also wore a very short skirt , 6in platform shoes and facial piercings			1
but she was allowed in to the venue because her risqué look did not break the dress code			1
in contrast to @entity22 , which requires female racegoers to wear formal attire and a hat , @entity26 – where the @entity27 will be run today – is less strict			1
however , mrs @entity7 – who attended the @entity27 festival meeting with husband @entity29 , 40 , and friends – may have had a motive for showing off her body art. the former pupil at £ 14,000 - a - year @entity34 owns a local tattoo parlour , where her clients include several famous footballers			1
tattoos have been increasingly on show at @entity8 ’ days in recent years , sparking a debate over whether they lower the tone			0
@entity44 , 50 , a sales assistant from @entity45 , said : ‘ i do n’t like these tattoos at @entity26			0
it spoils people ’s outfits and looks a bit cheap			1
i ’ve been coming here for ten years and i remember it used to be a more pleasant experience			0
‘ a lot of girls are getting drunk and being sick in the toilets			0
i ca n’t remember it being like that before			0

bold blooms , big hats and modest heels *reigned* *supreme* among the elegantly dressed female racegoers
however @entity7 , a 25 - year - old tattoo parlour owner , chose her own risqué look
it did n't break the dress code - however fellow racegoers *criticised* the body art for looking ' cheap '
