for many people , chatting to friends is a major reason to use @entity4 ’s app on their smartphone			1
but soon they will have to download the social network ’s partner app , called messenger , to carry on their instant conversations			1
@entity4 is reportedly notifying users of its popular app that they will no longer be able to send ' chat ' messages and will instead have to swap to @entity9 , which was launched three years ago			1
it follows the company 's acquisition of another popular messaging app , @entity21 , for us $ 19billion			0
‘ messenger is a much faster and better experience and we 've found that people get replies 20 per cent faster on messenger than on @entity4 , ’ a spokesman for the company told @entity37			2
‘ taking messages out of the @entity4 app also lets us focus on making @entity9 even better for everyone rather than working on two separate @entity4 messaging experiences			1
’ the company halted messaging in the main app for people who have already downloaded messenger in november , following the launch of @entity54			0
incentives to change : ' messenger is a much faster and better experience and we 've found that people get replies 20 per cent faster on messenger than on @entity4 , ' a spokesman for the company said			2
it also has extra features like the private sending of photos ( pictured left ) and free calls ( right ) the messenger app works in a similar way to @entity4 ’s core message feature , and users will tap a ‘ message ’ icon within the main app to be directed to @entity9			1
@entity4 has indicated that it is taking renewed interest in its messaging features following the @entity21 takeover			2
@entity21 is particularly popular outside @entity79 and lets people send unlimited messages for us $ 0.99cents a year			0
it has been widely reported that @entity4 has no immediate plans to merge @entity21 with messenger			1
@entity84 is awaiting a response from @entity4			2
both services , as well as many more , are becoming a mainstream alternative to texting , particularly in parts of the world like @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity79 where unlimited texts are not included in mobile contract bundles			0
not just for status updates ? in the future you could also use @entity4 to make electronic payments and stash money			1
the social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval from the @entity101 to become an emoney institution in the future , @entity4 's 1.2 - billion users could use the network to make electronic payments and save money as well as send messages			1
the social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would , for example , allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families			1
@entity4 is seeking regulatory approval from the @entity101 , which , if it is granted , would allow people to store money on the social network , transfer it to other users and pay for goods , according to a report by @entity123			1
the @entity101 told @entity84 ' it is not commenting on the issue at the moment ' , and @entity4 said it does not comment on rumour or speculation			2
a move into remittances would help @entity4 gain an even stronger foothold in emerging markets including @entity91 and @entity90			0
while @entity4 has not commented on the rumours a source , said to be familiar with the details , told the ft : ‘ @entity4 wants to become a utility in the developing world and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion			0
’ if those in developing nations flock to @entity4 , the company would boost its advertising revenues , and e-money services could become a big attraction - it would be particularly useful to users in areas without easy access to banks			2
@entity151 , lecturer in @entity152 at the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , told @entity84 : ' the materiality of banking and finance is changing rapidly and this change is most visible in emerging markets where they do not have the infrastructure in place			0
so it is a clean slate for new technology			0
' this is clearly evident in @entity90			0
@entity4 wants in on the game and the huge potential market			0
' she explained that there are two - and - a - half billion ' unbanked ' adults across the globe and so the potential market is huge .			0

social network reportedly plans to *disconnect* its @entity4 ' chat ' function
*facebook* users will instead have to use the @entity9 app
the *switchover* will begin in @entity28 , but no timeline has been given
users tap a message icon to be taken to the @entity9 app where they can send a message or private photos and make free phone calls
