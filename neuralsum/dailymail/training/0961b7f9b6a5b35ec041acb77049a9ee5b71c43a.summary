millions of travellers make the pilgrimage to @entity2 to take in the incredible 900 - year - old towers and sculptures of @entity6 's iconic temple complex			1
and now they have extra cause to make the trip , after archaeologists used @entity12 technology to reveal 200 hidden paintings on the buildings ' walls			1
while the faded pictures might be invisible to the naked eye , processed images show elephants , gods , musical instruments , boats and patterns , which are all thought to be ancient graffiti			1
a discovery to trumpet ! technology used by @entity12 has revealed 200 hidden paintings on the walls of @entity2 , including this pair of elephants archaeologist @entity31 took photographs with a bright flash and later used ‘ decorrelation stretch analysis ’ to enhance them and reveal the artwork on the walls			1
the tool is also used by @entity12 to look at the subtle colour differences in @entity41 rock in photographs taken by its opportunity rover on the red planet			1
at @entity2 it revealed more than 200 images of animals such as lions and elephants , people ; deities including the @entity55 monkey god hanuman ; boats and an image of the temple complex itself , a selection of which have been published in the journal @entity61			2
experts believe that the artistic markings were made by pilgrims visiting the holy site after it was abandoned in the 15th century , but the more elaborate paintings could have been created during earlier attempts to restore the temple to its former glory , @entity62 reported			1
the 500 - acre temple complex was built in the 12th century and is known for its intricate carvings , some of which measure more than half a mile ( 1km ) in length			2
most archaeologists believe that parts of the temple were painted , so when @entity80 , a rock - art researcher at @entity81 in @entity82 spotted paint traces and faint images in 2010 he was excited			2
he took photographs with a bright flash and later used ‘ decorrelation stretch analysis ’ to enhance them and reveal the artwork on the walls			1
the tool is also used by @entity12 to look at the subtle colour differences in @entity41 rock in photographs taken by its opportunity rover on the red planet			1
the @entity2 temple was built by the @entity98 in the early 12th century			2
although @entity2 appears , at first glance , to be a mass of stone with a central causeway it actually consists of a series of elevated towers , covered galleries , chambers , porches and courtyards on different levels connected by stairs revealed : experts took photographs of the fadest areas showing traces of paint ( top images ) with a bright flash and later used ‘ decorrelation stretch analysis ’ to enhance their photographs and reveal the artwork on the walls			1
a painting of @entity2 is pictured left and a boat , right no monkey business : experts believe that the artistic markings were made by pilgrims visiting the holy site after it was abandoned in the 15th century , but the more elaborate paintings could have been created during earlier attempts to restore the temple to its former glory			1
a @entity55 monkey god is pictured but at @entity2 it revealed more than 200 images of animals such as lions and elephants , people , deities including the @entity55 monkey god @entity142 , boats and an image of the temple complex itself , a selection of which have been published in the journal @entity61			2
‘ some of the most detailed paintings , the ones located at the top of the temple , are passed by literally thousands of visitors every day , but the most elaborate scenes are effectively invisible to the naked eye , ’ dr @entity80 told @entity148			2
because some of the paintings are so haphazardly arranged , experts believe they were graffiti left by visitors after the temple was abandoned for the first time in 1431			1
however , one group of painstakingly - drawn pictures , which are drawn on the highest part of one of the temple ’s towers , are thought to be part of a 16th century restoration programme , when the building was converted from a @entity167 to a @entity172 holy site			1
mapped : the 500 - acre temple complex was built in the 12th century and is known for its intricate carvings , some of which measure almost 1,093yards ( 1km ) in length			2
here , a map shows where hidden paintings were discovered music to archaeologists ' ears : a chamber - known as the @entity185 - contains a scene showing @entity98 musical instruments ( pictured ) such as different types of xylophones , gongs and wind instruments the real deal : a @entity98 musical ensemble known as the pinpeat , which is made up of gongs and appears in the faded artwork is pictured the chamber – known as the @entity185 - contains a scene showing @entity98 musical instruments such as different types of xylophones , gongs and wind instruments as well as another showing people riding horses between simples			1
dr @entity80 believes that the most skilful artworks may have been commissioned by @entity6 's @entity206 who launched the restoration project			0
during his reign between 1528 and 1566 @entity2 was transformed from a @entity167 dedicated to the god @entity209 into a @entity172 site and numerous carvings were completed			0
some of the faded paintings appear to support his theory as they feature @entity172 iconography such as a monument known as a stupa			0
it is thought that the long - lost paintings could further experts ’ knowledge about a little - known period in the temple ’s existence			1
@entity2 ( pictured ) lies 3.4 miles ( 5.5km ) north of the town of @entity226 in @entity6			0
the region contains the remains of the different capitals of the @entity230 , dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries @entity2 in @entity6 is one of the most significant archaeological sites in southeast @entity235 and home to the magnificent remains of the @entity2 the temple complex lies 3.4 miles ( 5.5km ) north of the town of @entity226 in @entity6			0
the region contains the remains of the different capitals of the @entity230 , dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries			0
the @entity2 temple was built by the @entity98 in the early 12th century			0
@entity242 is the @entity244 word for temple			0
it was built as a @entity55 place of worship but in 1432 , when the capital moved to @entity249 , @entity2 was maintained by @entity172 monks			0
although @entity2 appears , at first glance , to be a mass of stone with a central causeway , it actually consists of a series of elevated towers and covered galleries on different levels connected by stairs			0
the galleries and its columns set the boundaries for the first and second levels , while the third level supports five towers - one in each corner , and one in the centre			0
each tower features graduated tiers that create a cone shape , and the highest tower within the temple complex is 699ft ( 213m )			0
the outer gallery of the temple contains bas - reliefs that stretch for almost 1,960ft ( 600m ) , including the @entity278 gallery in the western section			2
it is thought @entity2 was built as funerary temple for @entity98 facing the west towards the setting sun – a symbol for death			0
the bas - reliefs were designed to be viewed from left to right in the order of a @entity55 funeral ritual , and this supports the funerary claims			0
@entity2 is said to be a ‘ miniature replica of the universe in stone ’ and represents an earthly model of the cosmic world			0
easy riders : the @entity296 also contains a frieze showing people riding horses between what appear to be temples ( pictured ) changing rooms : @entity2 was transformed from a @entity167 dedicated to the god @entity209 into a @entity172 site			0
some of the faded paintings feature @entity172 iconography such as a monument known as a stupa ( pictured ) plain sailing : experts believe that the artistic markings , such as the boat , pictured , were made by pilgrims visiting the holy temple complex after it was abandoned in the 15th century			1

faded pictures in the temple show gods , musical instruments and boats
some are thought to be graffiti left by pilgrims after the @entity167 was abandoned in 15th century
other more skilful works are thought to be part of a renovation effort
paintings were revealed using ‘ decorrelation stretch analysis ' to enhance photos - the same technique used by @entity12 to *examine* @entity41 rocks
