@entity0 is the only defender in the @entity1 who i would back in a one - v - one situation against @entity4			1
the @entity6 man is one of @entity7 ’s best but so is @entity0 : they both have pace , strength and intelligence			1
@entity4 is tough to mark because he bullies defenders , can get on the end of crosses and is fast enough to get away from most people marking him			2
but it is his touch that surprises me most — he has excellent technical ability with both feet			0
he can have a tear up or score the perfect goal and that is unusual			1
every defender in the @entity1 will be relishing the chance to play against @entity4			0
@entity0 will play him in a fair way — he is not a wind - up merchant — and likewise @entity4 will know not to waste energy trying to wind up the @entity51			1
@entity0 has started the season brilliantly and wo n’t be thrown around by the spaniard like @entity55 was last weekend			1
@entity0 will be thinking , ' you ’re not going to do that to me '			0
he will keep tight to him and back himself to win each duel , be that in the air or on the ground			0
@entity0 ’s main problem will be that @entity4 will try to shift away from him and on to @entity65			2
@entity65 copes well in the air but he ’s not as fast as @entity4 and @entity0 may well stand nearer to his central defensive partner in order to help him out			2
the problem with that is it will mean there is space elswhere for others to exploit			0
@entity6 must also put a lot of pressure on @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
if they can stop the supply to @entity4 , their lives will be a lot easier			0
@entity4 scored a hat - trick against @entity84 and has seven in five matches this season @entity4 shows his physicality by shoving @entity55 ( right ) off the ball against @entity84 @entity4 combines the touch of @entity39 ( left ) with the physical presence of @entity41			1

@entity0 and @entity4 will *clash* on *sunday* at the @entity91
@entity4 has a mix of @entity39 's touch and @entity41 's strength
@entity6 *striker* can have a tear up or score the perfect goal
