a chip shop owner is selling what he claims is the ultimate @entity3 lunch - a pie stuffed with steak pudding , chips , mushy peas and gravy			1
the 1ft - wide , £ 6.99 snack was invented by 54 - year - old @entity10 after he said @entity12 's ' hoity - toity ' fish - and - chips pie was too small			1
inspired by the up - market food chain , he is now serving his own heart - stopping dish at his shop in @entity17 , @entity18 , declaring : ' it ’s all paninis and wraps for lunch these days			2
a man ca n’t go to work on a wrap ! ' meaty : @entity10 of @entity17 , @entity18 , is selling what he claims to be the ultimate @entity3 lunch - a steak pudding , chips , mushy peas and gravy pie			1
the 1ft - wide dish is thought to contain 2,100 calories mr @entity10 , who previously made the world 's largest @entity32 caked in batter , invented his pie after seeing a ' gastropub ' dish launched by @entity12 in april			1
the fish and chips pie claimed to be the world 's first and included an all - butter shortcrust pastry with minted pea puree , cod chunks , chips and bechamel tartar sauce for £ 3.49			2
but mr @entity10 said the pie - which has 531 calories compared to his pie 's estimated 2,100 , more than the daily recommendation for women - was ' a bit hoity - toity '			1
' you would need ten of them to fill you , ' he said			0
' this is proper @entity3 food			2
' the pie being served at mr @entity10 's @entity55 's @entity54 centres on a steamed steak suet dish known as a rag pudding			1
by the slice : mr @entity10 intends for the £ 6.99 pie to be shared between two , but it could be scoffed solo mouth - watering : the huge pie centres around a steak suet pudding surrounded by chunky chips the pudding is placed in the centre of the pie base and surrounded by chunky chips before a hefty dollop of mushy peas is spread on top			1
the 1ft - wide creation is then topped with gravy before mr @entity10 adds a pastry pie lid and puts it in the oven			1
because mr @entity10 orders his rag puddings from a specialist supplier in @entity78 , @entity79 , customers must pre-order each pie before coming into the shop			2
layering up : mr @entity10 then adds mushy peas and a generous portion of gravy until the base is full finished product : the pie is topped with mushy peas , gravy and a pastry lid before being put in the oven side order : the shop owner said customers can accompany their pie with whatever they want - even more chips large : mr @entity10 said his customers were complaining about gastropub pies being the size of cupcakes mr @entity10 's pie contains a rag pudding , a traditional dish first eaten in @entity79 and the surrounding region during the @entity106 of the 1800s			1
a former staple of chippy cuisine , the dish contains minced meat and onions which are wrapped in a suet pastry before being boiled or steamed			0
rag puddings were once cooked in a muslin cloth - a rag - which gave them a striking resemblance to a small pillow			0
nowadays they are similar in preparation and taste to more common steak and kidney puddings			0
' this is the real deal , ' he said			0
' customers have come in and asked me to do something because they said @entity12 's are like cupcakes			2
people want proper food so i did my own version			0
' i always look to do things that nobody 's done before , and nobody 's ever done this			0
' we ’re showing people how it ’s done			0
this is meant to feed two but if you could eat one to yourself go for it and give yourself a pat on the back if you finish			0
' mr @entity10 , who runs his shop with his wife @entity147 , 39 , is known for his food creations which he describes as ‘ putting a twist on the ordinary ’			2
as well as battering @entity32 and mince pies at christmas time , he has created ‘ @entity156 ’ and what he claimed was the world ’s tallest burger			0
' we just want to put a smile on people ’s faces , ' he said			0
no frills : @entity10 created the dish after saying an @entity12 fish - and - chips pie ( pictured ) was too small tasty : the chip shop meal pie is only the latest of a string of creations by mr @entity10 and his wife @entity147 , 39 finishing off : customers who want to try the pie will have to order one from the chip shop in advance			1

@entity10 serves the hefty meal from his shop in @entity17 , @entity18
the 54 - year - old got the idea after seeing ' hoity - toity ' @entity12 fish and chips pie
for £ 6.99 customers get 1ft - wide pie including an entire steak suet pudding
it has around 2,100 calories , more than daily recommendation for women
