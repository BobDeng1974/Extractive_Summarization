@entity0 has been known to his high school friends as a star goalie , a gifted swimmer and an avid nature lover , but there was one thing he had been keeping them in the dark about : he was gay			1
all that changed during a school dance earlier this year when the @entity11 invited another young man to a slow dance			0
as @entity15 's song @entity16 came over the speakers , a nervous @entity0 and the homecoming king held hands and swayed to the melody in front of the whole school			2
big moment : @entity0 ( left ) , 18 , a senior at @entity25 in @entity26 , came out as gay in the fall by dancing with the homecoming king ( right ) @entity29 athlete : @entity0 is an all - state goalie on his school soccer team and also plays on the football and tennis teams living in the shadows : @entity0 ( center bottom row ) wrote in a personal essay that growing up in rural @entity26 , he could never imagine telling anyone he was gay last week , the all - state soccer goalie wrote a poignant personal essay about his inspiring coming out story for @entity42 's @entity41 website			1
' it was something i thought i 'd never do -- dance a slow dance with the homecoming king at his high school , ' the young athlete wrote			1
@entity0 explained that growing up in rural @entity26 , he was afraid to be mocked by his friends and ostracized by his family and neighbors for being openly gay			1
yet on the night of the homecoming dance in october , for the first time in his life @entity0 was dancing with another man			1
' it was a weird feeling for me , since i had just barely started coming out , ' the 18 - year - old confided			0
' i was nervous yet excited			0
' after the party , @entity0 asked his date - a boy from another school named @entity63 - to be his boyfriend			2
' i posed the question by writing it on the dry erase board on his wall			0
he quickly said yes , ’ @entity0 revealed in writing			1
fateful night : two weeks after the slow dance with the homecoming king , @entity0 ( bottom left ) invited the boy , @entity63			2
as his date to the @entity25 homecoming dance split opinion : @entity0 , pictured with female cheerleaders , said most people at hs school have accepted him , but there also have been some negative remarks about his coming out , especially from the jocks two weeks later , it was homecoming dance at @entity0 's high school , and the star goalie and member of the @entity88 , tennis and swimming teams decided to use the opportunity to reveal his true identity as a gay man to his own classmates			1
the 18 - year - old and his new boyfriend danced the night away in the school cafeteria , and whenever someone would come up to @entity0 and ask him if he and @entity63 were together , he would say , ' yes			2
' but as word about his sexuality spread around the school in the days following the party , @entity0 discovered that not everyone was ready to accept him for who he was			2
' " he is a f * * * * * now , " i was told some people said , ' wrote @entity0			0
the senior explained that from a very young age , he knew that he was attracted to boys , but he could not fathom sharing his feelings with his ultra-conservative and devout family , or with anyone else in their isolated mountainous community			0
even as a freshman in high school , @entity0 said on the most part he kept mum about his sexuality for fear of becoming a pariah at school , where some of his teammates have been known to casually throw around gay slurs			1
inspiring figure : @entity0 's essay , published last tuesday , has since gone viral drawing the courageous teenagers much praise from the @entity131 community bright future : after graduating high school next spring , @entity0 is hoping to continue playing soccer on the college level it was n't until his junior year that @entity0 finally mastered the courage to come out to his best friend on the soccer team , but even then he waited until the season was over , just to be on the safe side			1
to his relief , the teammate reassured @entity0 that his being gay will not change their friendship			0
now feeling more confident about himself , @entity0 began laying the groundwork for a public reveal , which came on the day of the homecoming dance in @entity63 's school in a neighboring county , followed by the dance at his own school			1
@entity0 wrote in his touching essay that it was the coming out story of @entity160 player @entity159 that ultimately inspired him to cast aside his anxiety and emerge from the shadows			1
while some people have been critical of the openly gay teen , he has made many new friends ‘ i did n't want to hide how i really was any more , ’ he stated			2
‘ i did n't want to live every day with a secret hanging over my head			0
i told my team before my own parents			0
’ when players on @entity0 's soccer team learned he was gay , some of them could not believe it at first , telling him he ' always acted so straight			0
' @entity0 wrote he has made many new friends since coming out , and most of his teammates have accepted him			0
looking beyond his high school experience , which will come to an end next spring , @entity0 says he has been in talks with college soccer coaches about playing for their schools			1
‘ that will be a whole new level , a whole new school , group of friends , and new teammates , ’ he wrote			0
‘ but i wo n't be afraid of being myself since i am proud to play as an athlete who happens to be gay			0
’ @entity0 's essay , published last tuesday , has since gone viral , drawing much praise from the lgbt community , including the source of his inspiration , @entity159 , who even sent him a signed copy of his new autobiography with a personal inscription			1
