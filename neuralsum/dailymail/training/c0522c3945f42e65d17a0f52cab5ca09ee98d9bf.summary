former @entity1 minister @entity0 is facing a fresh police investigation after he resigned as an mp yesterday for fiddling his expenses			1
@entity5 last night vowed to examine a report by the parliamentary commissioner for standards which found mr @entity0 guilty of submitting 19 false claims ‘ plainly intended to deceive ’ @entity10 ’s expenses authority			1
but he could still dodge criminal charges because evidence submitted to @entity10 is inadmissible in court			1
former europe minister @entity0 today quit the @entity14 , hours after a parliamentary demanded he be suspended for a year for claims which were claims were ' plainly intended to deceive ' the former europe minister announced he was quitting after mps on the @entity18 banned him from the @entity14 for a year for what they described as ‘ the gravest ’ breach of expenses they have seen			1
mr @entity0 claimed thousands in travel expenses so he could jet around @entity25 and for consulting services using fake invoices from a front organisation that he had set up			1
‘ the bills were signed with a “ nom de plume ” purporting to come from a general manager who did not in fact exist , ’ the @entity17 said			1
the former mp for @entity33 also claimed thousands of pounds for computers and laptops , including one which he allowed an intern to keep after they stopped working for him			2
the total mr @entity0 claimed on expenses for computers was £ 5,968			1
he even submitted the same invoice twice for one computer he bought			0
he also used his parliamentary expenses to ‘ entertain his @entity25 contacts ’ and claimed for ‘ extensive ’ book purchases			2
commons expenses watchdogs said his claims for extensive @entity25 travel , including air fares , hotels and meals were of the ‘ utmost gravity ’			0
mr @entity0 claimed for eight computers on parliamentary expenses , and gave one to an intern when they stopped working for him labour leader @entity57 moved quickly to suspend mr @entity0 from the party today in total the claims made between 2004 and 2008 were worth £ 12,900			1
the @entity18 said it was impossible to say how much mr @entity0 claimed ‘ outside the rules ’ , but it ‘ may have been in the order of £ 7,500 ’			1
one mp on the committee said : ‘ based on what i have seen i think he should be in jail			2
’ here is @entity0 's full resignation statement : ' in the light of the parliamentary commissioner 's decision supported by the @entity72 to uphold the @entity74 complaint about expenses claimed in connection with my parliamentary work in @entity25 and in combating anti-semitism i have decided for the sake of my wonderful constituency of @entity33 and my beloved @entity1 to resign as an mp by applying for the @entity82 or as guided by the @entity84 authorities			1
' i have been overwhelmed by messages of support for my work as an mp on a range of issues but i accept that my parliamentary career is over			2
' i appreciate the committee 's ruling that i made no personal gain and i regret my foolishness in the manner i chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the prime minister 's personal envoy in @entity25			0
' i want to thank the people of @entity33 for allowing me to serve as their mp and the @entity1 for allowing me over the years to fight for the causes i believe in			2
' i have received so many messages supporting me from @entity1 and @entity104 mps as well as members of the public but i love the @entity84 and i hope by resigning i can serve by showing that @entity17 must take responsibility for their mistakes and accept the consequences of being in breach of the @entity84 rules			2
' mr @entity0 resigned as an mp after the @entity1 kicked him out and pronounced his career ‘ effectively over ’			1
a source close to @entity1 leader @entity57 said : ‘ @entity0 has done the right thing			2
’ but the affair is hugely embarrassing for mr @entity57 since he had only re-admitted him to the @entity1 in july			2
that came after the police announced that they were not pursuing fraud charges against mr @entity0			1
but last night @entity5 said they had not closed the case but had simply decided to take ‘ no further action ’ after advice from the @entity121			2
police did not previously have access to evidence used by the standards commissioner since it was subject to parliamentary privilege			2
a @entity123 spokesman said the force would now consider the contents of the @entity14 report			2
mr @entity0 could still avoid charges because letters in which he makes a number of frank statements about his expenses claims submitted to the inquiry could not be used as evidence in court			1
the @entity140 of the @entity141 , @entity142 , who is responsible for parliamentary privilege issues , confirmed that he believed none of mr @entity0 ’s correspondence or other evidence would be admissible			1
but he said police may now be able to use the letters as a ‘ map ’ to further their own inquiries			0
@entity104 mp @entity151 has written to @entity5 calling on them to reopen their inquiries			1
he proclaimed the findings ‘ astonishing ’ and said they ‘ raise serious questions about whether mr @entity0 is guilty of criminal behaviour ’			1
he said : ‘ if someone has committed an offence then they should face the full force of the law and to be protected by parliamentary privilege is most unsatisfactory			0
’ a second letter calling for the case to be reopened has also been submitted by blogger @entity165 , who runs the @entity167 website			0
police will now examine the evidence that between 2005 and 2008 mr @entity0 submitted 19 invoices from a body called the @entity172 ( @entity173 ) for work including ‘ research and translation work as agreed ’ and ‘ research and translation consultancy ’			1
during part of that period he was a @entity25 envoy to then prime minister @entity180			0
but the @entity173 had ‘ no formal structure ’			0
names given on letterheads for general manager , an acting director and four associate directors were old friends of mr @entity0			1
the organisation had no office and there had never been any salaried staff			0
the bank account was controlled by mr @entity0 himself			1
2004 : a visit to @entity195 to inspect how @entity197 's new government would impact @entity199 politics			0
2005 : january : trip to @entity200 to meet mps			0
summer : trip to @entity203 and the @entity204 ahead of referendums on @entity207 treaty followed by a visit to @entity209 ahead of @entity210 joining the @entity207			0
2006 : february : a visit to @entity210 to report on the country 's politics			0
march : a visit to @entity215			0
@entity216 : two visits to @entity200 to meet diplomats followed by trips to @entity220 and @entity221			0
2007 : @entity216 : a trip to @entity203 ahead of presidential election			0
november : a trip to @entity215 , @entity220 , @entity225 and @entity226			0
2008 : december : a trip to @entity209 for @entity173 meetings			0
the mps on the @entity18 said mr @entity0 ’s expertise on @entity25 ‘ does not excuse his behaviour in knowingly submitting 19 false invoices over a period of four financial years which were plainly intended to deceive the parliamentary expenses authorities			1
this is far from what would be acceptable in any walk of life			0
’ while mr @entity241 repaid the wrongly claimed expenses , the report found his actions went ' far beyond what was allowable ' under paliamentary rules			2
mr @entity0 , a @entity246 journalist before he entered the world of politics , last night appeared to be in denial , issuing a bizarre statement blaming his plight on the @entity74 , which submitted the initial complaint about his abuse of expenses			1
he claimed his transgression was ‘ the manner i chose to be reimbursed for work including working as the prime minister ’s personal envoy in @entity25 ’			0
@entity104 mp @entity151 today asked the police to ' to consider reopening the investigation into mr @entity0 ' dear sirs , as you will be aware , today the @entity263 has published its report regarding the expenses claims of @entity0 mp			1
the findings are astonishing and raise serious questions about whether mr @entity0 is guilty of criminal behaviour			1
i note @entity272 below : false accounting			0
( 1 ) where a person dishonestly , with a view to gain for himself or another or with intent to cause loss to another , — ( a ) destroys , defaces , conceals or falsifies any account or any record or document made or required for any accounting purpose ; or ( b ) in furnishing information for any purpose produces or makes use of any account , or any such record or document as aforesaid , which to his knowledge is or may be misleading , false or deceptive in a material particular ; he shall , on conviction on indictment , be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years			0
( 2 ) for purposes of this section a person who makes or concurs in making in an account or other document an entry which is or may be misleading , false or deceptive in a material particular , or who omits or concurs in omitting a material particular from an account or other document , is to be treated as falsifying the account or document			0
i understand that the evidence collected by the committee during its investigation was subject to parliamentary privilege , and thus could not be used by the @entity121			0
now that the report has been published , and parliamentary privilege no longer applies , i would ask you to consider reopening the investigation into mr @entity0			1

@entity33 mp resigns from @entity10 after *devastating* parliamentary report called for him to be suspended for a year
@entity321 found he created invoices signed by a ' nom de plume '
@entity5 is asked by @entity104 mp to reopen case to see ' whether mr @entity0 is guilty of criminal behaviour '
@entity263 says it is the ' gravest case ' it has come across which has not gone to court
