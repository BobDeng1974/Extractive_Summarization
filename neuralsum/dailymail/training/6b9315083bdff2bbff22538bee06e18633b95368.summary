@entity1 leaders on @entity2 are changing their approach in the battle to block president @entity6 's unilateral changes to the immigration system			1
after @entity10 on monday filibustered for the fourth time a bill that would defund the president 's immigration measures while fully supporting the rest of the @entity15 , @entity1 @entity9 leader @entity8 said he would introduce new legislation targeting @entity6 's immigration ' overreach ' that is not tied to appropriations for @entity15			1
house speaker @entity22 , through an aide , swiftly backed his @entity9 counterpart 's move , creating an avenue for the @entity1 to end its standoff with the president - who on tuesday again pressured congressional @entity1 to take up immigration reform - and his party before a friday evening deadline to fund @entity15 or allow it to temporarily shutdown			1
in an op - ed tuesday @entity6 again defended his directives and called on @entity47 to make permanent reforms to the nation 's broken immigration system and argued that a @entity15 shutdown would be bad for the country speaking on the @entity9 floor on tuesday , @entity38 encouraged @entity10 to vote for his bill to prevent the president 's executive actions from being enforced			1
' the bill is n’t tied to @entity15 funding			2
there ’s no excuse for our friends on the other side to oppose it , ' he said			0
@entity38 asserted that the bill would take away @entity10 ' ability to hide ' behind all manner of excuses to avoid upsetting the @entity69 ' in the immigration debate and force them to say on record whether they support the president 's ' extreme overreach			1
' the @entity9 's head lawmaker said it is still his preference that the upper chamber approve the @entity79 - passed legislation that funds all of the @entity15 's activities except those mandated by @entity6 in november			1
' but as long as @entity10 continue to prevent us from even debating that bill , i ’m ready to try another way , ' he said			0
following @entity38 's announcement from the @entity9 floor on monday night , a top aide to @entity89 indicated to reporters that his boss would back the altered strategy			2
' this vote will highlight the irresponsible hypocrisy of any @entity9 @entity96 who claims to oppose president @entity6 ’s executive overreach on immigration , but refuses to vote to stop it , ' @entity22 spokesman @entity93 said in a statement			1
' if we are going to work together on the @entity106 peoples priorities , @entity103 @entity10 must be honest with the people they represent			0
' the move has some conservatives concerned that @entity38 may be capitulating to @entity10			0
conservatives wanted to tie funding for the entire federal government to legislation undercutting @entity6 's immigration directives , but settled in december to a bill that would only put the @entity15 's monies in jeopardy based on a promise from leadership that it would fight ' tooth and nail ' to stop the president			1
' this was entirely predictable , ' a @entity1 @entity9 aide told @entity124 on tuesday			1
' we knew leader @entity38 was going to have a big challenge			0
' ' while this strategy if pursued with commitment and vigilance could be a winning one , the fear is it may only be a crafty way to appear to be fighting while signaling a white flag , ' the aide , who was not authorized to speak on the record on this matter and asked not to be named , said			0
@entity10 have said for months that the debate over reforms to the immigration system should be separated from funding for the @entity15			2
senate minority leader @entity139 drove this point home in remarks from the @entity9 floor on tuesday and at a press conference with his @entity146 colleagues that afternoon			2
' @entity10 have said all along that we are more than happy to have an immigration debate here on the @entity9 floor , so long as we first fully fund the @entity15 , ' @entity139 said			1
@entity139 said he does ' appreciate ' @entity38 's need to ' please the extreme voices on his side , then called on him to allow a vote on a ' clean ' @entity15 funding bill			2
' the fact remains that we are four days away from a @entity15 shutdown , ' he said			0
' funding expires on friday , and yet last night the majority leader moved to bring a bill to the floor that does absolutely nothing to fund @entity15 – nothing			2
' at the presser , @entity139 invoked @entity106 's enemies and noted that they 'll still continue to operate while @entity15 is shutdown , if it comes to that			2
' @entity168 is funded , we see that every day on tv , ' he said			0
contending that the @entity9 has ' fiddled around here for four weeks , ' he said instead of funding one of its most vital departments , @entity139 told reporters , ' it appears to me that the ideologues are still running the @entity1			2
' even if @entity1 were to convince @entity10 to get on board with their original course of action , a shutdown would still be on the table			2
the @entity79 has already said it would veto legislation that attempts to interfere with the president 's immigration directives , @entity1 attempts			1
on monday , with just five days left until a shutdown , the @entity6 administration tried to raise the stakes for @entity1			1
the president argued that temporary shutdown would have a ' direct impact ' on national security - a sentiment that was later echoed at a press conference by his homeland security secretary @entity196			1
president @entity6 on monday , while speaking to a group of governors at the @entity79 , claimed that a @entity15 shutdown would have a ' direct impact ' on national security in attempt to convince @entity1 to change course while the majority of @entity15 would remain up and running in the case of a shutdown - just 15 percent of the department 's workers were sent home during a 16 - day standoff between @entity1 and @entity10 in 2014 - the @entity79 argued that some of the furloughed employees , while deemed non-essential for these purposes , were more important to @entity15 ' operations that it would at first seem			1
the president 's spokesman also told reporters that the @entity220 to engage in future planning would be negatively affected if workers were sent home			0
roughly 30,0000 of @entity15 ' employees would be kept out of the office , @entity227 estimates , in the case of a shutdown , while another 200,000 would be asked to stay on with delayed pay			0
president @entity6 again jumped into the fray on tuesday morning with an op - ed in @entity233 urging the @entity1 - led @entity47 to have a robust debate on permanent reforms to the nation 's immigration process			1
@entity6 reiterated his previous claims that would n't have had to unilaterally take action if the legislative branch had passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill backed by his administration in the last session of @entity47			1
' our immigration system has been broken for decades , ' he wrote on tuesday			0
' our country deeply values fairness , but our immigration system has become unfair to businesses , workers and families alike			0
' that ’s something i ’ve been trying to change as president			0
' defending his mandates , which will protect 4 million illegal immigrants from deportation if or when they are implemented , the president said they ' are good for our economy , for our families and for our country			0
' ' but i also continue to believe that these steps are no substitute for congressional action , ' he said			0
' it ’s time to end the era of manufactured crises , put politics aside and focus on doing what ’s best for @entity106			0
' so while i will fight any attempt to turn back the progress we ’ve made or break up families across our country , i welcome the opportunity to work with anyone who wants to build on the improvements we ’ve put in place , and fix our broken immigration system once and for all			0
