@entity0 yesterday vowed to work with @entity1 to ‘ lock the @entity2 out ’ of power			1
in an extraordinary speech in @entity7 , @entity5 ’s first minister claimed voters across the @entity9 would welcome her party ’s influence at @entity12 , saying she would end austerity			1
but , following mounting pressure from senior colleagues , @entity14 last night tried to draw a line under speculation about a @entity1 - @entity20 government by ruling out a formal coalition			1
labour leader @entity14 said a formal coalition with the @entity20 ' will not happen ' - but failed to rule out forming a looser alliance on a vote - by - vote basis the @entity1 leader said there would be ‘ no @entity20 ministers ’ in any government he leads after may ’s general election			1
but mr @entity14 pointedly refused to rule out a deal that would see the resurgent @entity5 nationalists prop up a minority @entity1 government in key commons votes – the preferred option of @entity36			1
‘ this was a lot of hype to rule out something no one was proposing , ’ the first minister said			0
‘ mr @entity14 ’s statement is absolutely fine from our point of view , because formal coalition with seats in the @entity9 government has never been our preference			0
‘ but working with @entity1 in a looser arrangement , i certainly would n’t rule out because i want to see @entity20 @entity51 in the @entity52 pushing for progressive change			1
i also do n’t want to see @entity54 re-elected			0
' as long as there are more @entity20 and @entity51 than there are @entity2 mps , we can lock the @entity2 out of government , there is no question about that			2
’ pollsters suggest the @entity20 is on course for an unprecedented breakthrough at the general election , winning dozens of @entity1 seats and depriving mr @entity14 of any chance of a majority			1
@entity69 , of @entity70 and one of the country ’s leading election experts , said the @entity20 appeared on the brink of winning 45 of @entity5 ’s 59 seats			1
ms @entity0 , appearing on @entity78 's @entity77 show , claimed that if @entity1 ruled out a deal with the @entity20 they would be saying they were happy to see @entity54 ' waltz back in to @entity82 ' ‘ that means the formation of any government after may 7 will be with the acquiescence of the @entity20 , ’ the professor added			1
‘ mr @entity14 ’s chances may indeed depend on him coming to some arrangement with the @entity20			0
’ electoral deals between two or more parties can take various guises			0
a full - scale coalition is a power - sharing deal of the kind struck by @entity54 and @entity96 , with a shared programme and ministers from different parties			0
one step down from a coalition is an arrangement called ‘ confidence and supply ’			0
in exchange for concessions to its interests , a smaller party agrees to back a larger one in key commons votes			0
a still looser arrangement is possible , whereby a minority labour government would negotiate with the @entity20 to win its backing on every major vote			2
@entity114 , the leader of the @entity115 , said an issue - by - issue deal between @entity1 and the @entity20 would be ‘ even worse ’			1
‘ every day the @entity20 could come back with more demands , ’ said the @entity2 mp			2
miss @entity0 , speaking at the @entity119 , set out a shopping list of demands for a deal with @entity1 , including £ 180billion of extra borrowing , ditching the @entity125 nuclear deterrent , and billions more in benefits for the working poor			1
she said the @entity20 would ensure that any government it supports offered an ‘ alternative to austerity ’			0
in the past , the @entity20 imposed a ‘ self - denying ordinance ’ on its mps which prevented them from voting on most ‘ @entity133 - only ’ issues at @entity12			0
but , with the possibility of a power - sharing deal in sight , this principle has been ditched			0
miss @entity0 yesterday said @entity20 mps were entitled to dictate policy at @entity12 in return for their votes			2
‘ we have clear and constructive views on many aspects of @entity9 policy which affect @entity5 deeply – views which we know are often shared by many people elsewhere in the @entity9			2
and we intend to bring those ideas forward in a positive spirit , ’ she said			0
she insisted that voters in @entity152 could trust her not to use a hung parliament as part of a plan to make another attempt to break up the country			0
last night an @entity159 poll for the @entity160 revealed 43 per cent of voters are worried about the @entity20 determining who runs the @entity9			2
@entity163 in @entity5 @entity164 ( left ) said the party would not make any ' backroom deals ' with the @entity20			1

@entity20 chief said she would vote @entity169 in @entity152 and @entity170 in @entity171
but she called for deal with @entity1 after the election to keep the @entity2 out
ms @entity0 she she would impose left - wing policies across the @entity9
she said the @entity20 wanted to do more than just serve @entity5 's interests
