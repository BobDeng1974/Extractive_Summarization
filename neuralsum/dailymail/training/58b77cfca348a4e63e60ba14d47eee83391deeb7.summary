by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 02:27 est , 26 july 2013 @entity1 will put a captured @entity3 ship on display this week as part of a new war museum			1
the @entity7 , the only @entity3 ship held by a foreign government , will go on display as the crown jewel of a @entity12 on @entity13 , which commemorates the signing of the treaty that ended the @entity16 60 years ago			1
restored as part of the effort to renovate the museum , the @entity7 was captured in the late 60s of the eastern coast of @entity1			0
the @entity7 is held up in the @entity1 as proof the country stood up and drove out the @entity23 its a museum : the @entity7 sits on the banks of a @entity26 , @entity1 river as @entity1 soldiers walk past it the museum , on the banks of a river in @entity26 , the capital of @entity1 , has been fully restored as part of the country ’s celebration of the 60th anniversary of their victory by way of treaty			1
once captured , the crew were held hostage in the reclusive @entity42 country for 11 months			1
having not been recovered or sunk , the ship is still listed as a commissioned @entity3 vessel			1
‘ i got shot up in the original capture , so we were taken by bus and then train for an all - night journey to @entity26 in @entity1 , and then they put us in a place we called the barn , ’ @entity46 sergeant @entity45 said			0
saying that food was scarce , causing him to lose 60 pounds , @entity45 added that the crew was forced to eat ‘ fried turnips for breakfast , turnip soup for lunch , and fried turnips for dinner			0
’ tourist destination : @entity1 now tour the ship in groups as part of a visit to a war museum not a battleship : the @entity7 was barely armed , meant for intelligence gathering only international waters : at over 15 miles from the coast , the @entity7 was well beyond the 12 miles of territorial waters claimed by @entity1 never built for combat , the @entity7 was launched in 1944 as a @entity75 cargo ship before being repurposed for intelligence gathering in 1967 , before being sent to the @entity77 later that year , according to the @entity3			2
purposely not heavily armed , the @entity7 was easily overtaken by @entity12 forces in january , 1968 , in an attack that killed one sailor and saw the remaining 82 , including three seriously injured , captured			1
@entity12 officials claimed shortly after the attack that the @entity7 was in @entity12 territorial waters and posed a threat , a claim the @entity23 denied			2
the @entity3 claimed the ship was over 15 miles from the coast of the nearest island – well beyond the 12 miles of territorial waters claimed by @entity1 , in a subsequent film released by the @entity3			0
by corroborating that evidence with location reporting from both the @entity7 and a sub hunter in the area , the @entity3 believes it has proof that the @entity1 misled @entity23 officials as to the location of the ship when it was overrun by forces from six boats covered by air support from @entity103 fighter jets			1
in @entity12 waters : @entity1 asserts the @entity7 was in the country 's territorial waters when captured , according to a propaganda video released by the @entity42 nation dear leader : @entity12 patriarch @entity110 , referred to as ' dear leader in the @entity1 , ' is seen in this propaganda video in which @entity1 claimed ' the @entity23 imperialists went down on their knees again ' the @entity23 was hesitant to commit to a battle over the ship with @entity1 because it was in the middle of the @entity117 to the south , and was wary about being spread too thin			1
despite being an intelligence gathering ship , according to the @entity3 , crew members have long asserted they had little information of value to share with @entity1 , which resulted in brutal beating at the hands of @entity12 soldiers			2
‘ the @entity1 basically told us , they put stuff in front of us , they said you were here , you were spying , you will be shot as spies , ’ @entity126 said , adding that beatings were shared equally among the captive crew			0
put in front of cameras to confess , @entity7 crew members were courageously defiant during their forced confessions , even extending middle fingers in images seen outside the country			0
once wise to the gesture , @entity12 soldiers beat the soldiers even more for their boldness			0
held hostage : crew members of the @entity7 hold up their hands while in captivity in @entity1 in 1968 forced confessions : crew members of @entity7 pose while in captivity in @entity1 in 1968 long ago , but not forgotten : former @entity7 crew member @entity150 holds a painting of the @entity7 at his home in @entity153 , @entity154 founder : @entity110 founded the @entity12 state , leading it until his son @entity157 took over after his death only after a signed statement from major general @entity160 , the chief @entity23 negotiator with @entity1 , apologizing for ‘ the grave acts ’ committed against @entity1 when the @entity7 ‘ illegally intruded ’ into the country ’s territorial waters , were the hostages let go			1
@entity160 read a statement into the record disavowing the confession both before and after the apology			0
the hostages were released across the demilitarized zone between @entity171 two days before @entity172 , 11 months to the day after their capture			1
initially considered for a court marshall for losing his ship , commander @entity174 never saw any charges brought against him after it was determined the crew had suffered enough			0
hostile takeover : several speedboats filled with @entity12 soldiers had little trouble taking over the lightly armed @entity7 after spraying it with gunfire for about an hour for cargo : known as the @entity187 prior to being commissioned the @entity7 for the @entity3 , the ship was used to transport @entity75 cargo in the waning days of @entity190 family business : @entity192 , grandson of @entity110 , took over @entity1 in 2012 after the passing of his father @entity157 defending the ship ’s captain , @entity126 said ‘ it would have been nice to take out some of the guys , some of them , and maybe go down fighting , but it would have been total suicide			2
’ @entity1 was said to have been close to returning the ship to the @entity23 in 2002 , but reportedly back - peddled – an act that haunts the former crew even now			2
‘ it 's very disappointing to have it still there , and still being used as anti-american propaganda , ’ @entity205 said .			0

the only @entity23 navy ship held by another country , is still listed as a commissioned @entity3 vessel
the siege killed one sailor and injured three , with the remaining 82 crew held hostage for 11 months in 1968
