@entity188 said @entity194 would make little effort to collect the more than 100,000 signatures needed to get a recall measure on the ballot , setting it up to fail and preventing another recall drive for six months			0
promises : mayor @entity2 of @entity3 speaks at a press conference on friday announcing his intention to seek professional help for sexual harassment issues @entity194 denied the accusation on tuesday , saying @entity188 or anyone else was welcome to join the recall drive			2
