by @entity0 last updated at 1:26 am on 19th october 2011 computer hacker @entity1 is challenging a @entity4 bid to extradite him on charges of hacking into highly sensitive military computers @entity1 should not be protected from extradition – but asylum seekers must get fresh safeguards , a ‘ whitewash ’ inquiry has concluded			1
it said a treaty between the @entity15 and the @entity4 was not ‘ lopsided ’ and did not need changing to stop @entity15 citizens being unfairly bundled on a plane to @entity4			2
and it rejected calls for new rules blocking transfer to a foreign country when the alleged offence took place largely in @entity15 – as in the case of computer hacker mr @entity1			1
but it did call for a new law to offer greater protection to those claiming asylum			1
the panel recommended that anybody claiming refugee status – whether they lodge their claim before or after the extradition process begins – be saved from being sent overseas until the asylum case is closed			1
it means a foreign national claiming asylum has better protection than a @entity15 citizen			1
campaigners called for @entity43 and @entity44 – who personally called the @entity46 ‘ lopsided ’ – to throw the report straight in the dustbin			0
politicians are not bound by the panel ’s findings and are free to begin efforts to renegotiate arrangements with the @entity4 mr @entity1 ’s mother , @entity54 , attacked the £ 250,000 report , which took a year to prepare , as a shameful ‘ whitewash ’			2
she told the @entity57 : ‘ this is a missed opportunity for @entity15 citizens to be shown that they matter and are n’t just being thrown to the dogs			2
‘ what message does it send to the world when the @entity15 government does n’t even care enough about its own people to give them the same protection as other countries give theirs ? ’ deputy prime minister @entity44 and @entity1 's mother , @entity54 , at a protest calling for a fair trial for @entity1 in 2009 the independent panel , headed by sir @entity72 , was set up by the @entity73 to investigate whether the treaty should be changed			1
its recommendations contradict the findings of the @entity78 , which called for the government to renegotiate the treaty to make it balanced			0
the @entity4 requires ‘ sufficient evidence to establish probable cause ’ before agreeing to extradite anyone to the @entity15 , but @entity15 going in the opposite direction are not afforded the same protection			1
waiting game : the review criticised the delay in cases such as that of @entity90 , a @entity91 cleric who is fighting an extradition bid to the @entity4 on terror charges instead of strengthening the powers of the home secretary to stop unjust extradition cases , the panel said she should have reduced responsibilities for determining human rights appeals			1
@entity101 is reconsidering mr @entity1 ’s case on the grounds that he has @entity104 ’s and could take his own life if extradited			0
if the recommendations were enacted , she would lose such responsibility			0
mr @entity1 hacked into @entity4 military computers from the bedroom of his north @entity111 flat			0
on his case , the panel said : ‘ we have no evidence that any injustice is being caused by the present arrangements			0
’ @entity118 mp @entity117 said : ‘ as the @entity78 highlighted , the operation of the @entity120 means that in practice many innocent @entity15 citizens subject to extradition have lower human rights safeguards compared to foreign national criminals we are trying to deport			1
those double standards corrode public confidence in the justice system			0
’ a spokesman for the prime minister said : ‘ we will set out our response in due course			0
’ in a second controversial decision , the @entity134 was declared to be working ‘ reasonably well ’			0
the @entity134 requires countries to send criminal suspects to the nation requesting their arrest			0
but there are concerns that it has led to innocent @entity15 being bundled on to planes with very flimsy evidence against them .			2

recommendations mean a foreign national claiming asylum has better protection than a @entity15 citizen
