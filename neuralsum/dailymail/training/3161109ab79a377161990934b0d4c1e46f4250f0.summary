by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:21 est , 15 june 2012 updated : 17:36 est , 15 june 2012 shares in @entity4 banks soared yesterday after the government outlined a dramatic plan to pump £ 140billion into the ailing economy			1
stock in state - backed @entity9 rose nearly 8 per cent and part - nationalised @entity10 went up by more than 5 per cent , adding £ 2.1billion to the value of taxpayers ’ holdings in the two banks			1
@entity15 was up more than 4 per cent			1
@entity16 : @entity17 , with lord mayor alderman @entity18 ( centre ) and @entity21 governor @entity20 , before his annual speech at @entity16 last night but the jump in bank shares raised fresh questions about whether the banks could end up being the main beneficiaries of the scheme , which is meant to force them to lend more money directly to cash - strapped small businesses and homeowners			1
the mini surge came after the @entity34 and the @entity21 joined forces to launch two packages to stimulate the economy and tackle the crisis spilling over from the eurozone			0
last night chancellor @entity17 was also facing questions about whether the taxpayer could be left with a fresh bill if the new loans turn bad			0
stunt : @entity17 is handed a @entity46 exercise book by @entity47 as he films a new comedy show for @entity50 @entity52 mp @entity51 , a member of the @entity53 public accounts committee , said : ‘ it ’s more or less explicit that the reason the government is stepping in to force lending is because their loans are to the type of businesses they would otherwise not make			0
‘ that means it ’s a bad risk and i think that means the taxpayer could well end up picking up the can			0
’ fellow @entity52 @entity67 gave a cautious welcome to the scheme but urged mr @entity17 to be upfront about the risks of the taxpayer being landed with new ‘ sub-prime ’ loans			0
mr @entity67 , a member of the @entity74 , said : ‘ new lending will only happen if the commercial banks take advantage of this cheap money to lend on			1
‘ some banks will only do so if the taxpayer covers losses when their customers default or go bust			1
is the @entity4 taxpayer prepared to stand behind these cheap loans ? @entity87 , chief economist at the @entity88 , said the chancellor and @entity90 were right to act			0
but he warned that the ‘ core problem ’ remained the uncertainty caused by the eurozone crisis			0
‘ the funding - for - lending scheme helps the supply of money and the demand for it , by lowering the cost of borrowing , ’ he said			1
‘ but the core problem remains			0
companies alarmed by the euro crisis will not be eager to borrow regardless of the cost			0
’ @entity4 's biggest bank will hammer millions of cash - strapped families by hiking the cost of slipping into the red			1
state - backed giant @entity10 will make 17million customers pay 20 per cent more to set up an overdraft and is raising rates to a whopping 19.94 per cent			1
the new rate is the highest charged by any of the big five banks and makes dipping into your overdraft more expensive than spending on a credit card			1
experts say the hikes , which take effect on october 2 , are unfair on loyal customers battling record low savings rates and a painful income squeeze			0
and they come despite the @entity21 freezing the base rate at its historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than three years			1
@entity124 , founder of campaigners @entity125 , said : ‘ this is a nasty , cynical move and is catastrophic for families , who are being forced to rely on overdrafts far more because of a financial crisis created by the banks			2
’ @entity10 is @entity4 ’s biggest provider of current accounts with 22million customers including its @entity135 arm			1
with the financial crisis in the eurozone spilling into @entity4 , bank profits have come under threat			0
as a result , they are trying to squeeze more out of customers who run out of cash at the end of the month			0
currently , @entity10 customers who arrange to have an overdraft pay between 12.43 and 19.28 per cent , depending on the type of account they are in			1
customers also pay £ 5 a month for the right to be overdrawn			1
from october , the rates on all accounts will increase to a minimum of 15.43 per cent , rising as high as 19.94 per cent			2
the monthly cost increases to £ 6			2
those hit with the biggest interest rate are customers in @entity10 ’ classic account			1
this is a free account and is most likely to be used by cash - strapped customers			2
it means that on each £ 1,000 borrowed for a year , they will pay £ 199.40 before any debt is scratched off			2
injection : the @entity21 is to pump up to £ 140bn - or one in every five pounds of total government spending - in to the @entity4 economy in a bid to stimulate lending big decision : the scheme was approved by the ' quad ' of senior ministers ; @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity17 and @entity175 banks will be lent the cash on condition they pass it on in the form of cheaper business loans and mortgages			1
ministers say the intervention will ease the credit drought starving small businesses and home buyers of cash			0
the initiative is also designed to protect our banks against fallout from the eurozone crisis by giving them easy access to cash from the @entity21			2
but some @entity52 right - wingers questioned the idea of trying to stimulate the economy by pouring billions more into cheap loans			2
@entity52 mp @entity200 described the policy as ‘ continuity @entity202 ’			0
he added : ‘ this is precisely the sort of medicine that made the economy sick in the first place			0
’ @entity209 , strategist at @entity211 trading firm @entity210 , said : ‘ investors have broadly welcomed this move as an effort to try and insulate at least some of the @entity4 economy and banking sector from further fallout from the @entity219 debt crisis			0
‘ however , whether this will end up having a significant impact on the underlying @entity4 economy is debatable – the reluctance of banks to lend is arguably just a small part of the overall economic malaise			2
’ supporters : conservative mp @entity228 , left , and @entity230 peer @entity229 have backed the initiative			0

shares in state - owned @entity9 rose nearly 8 per cent and @entity10 benefit from 5 per cent boost
*critics* question if banks will be the real winners from £ 140bn
