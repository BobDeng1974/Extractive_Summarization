by @entity0 with just over a month to go until she joins @entity2 for the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity1 appears to be pulling out all the stops to prove that motherhood has n't blunted her competitive edge			1
competing at the @entity10 in @entity11 , the 33 - year - old @entity9 silver medallist looked in tip top shape as she braved a difficult course in blazing sunshine			1
but it was n't all hard work , for watching from the sidelines was the royal 's six - month - old baby daughter @entity18 who was being looked after by a friend while her mother tackled the enormous jumps			2
earlier this month , @entity1 took to the field at the @entity35 near @entity36 - with baby @entity18 once more among the crowds			2
late june saw her enjoy a successful day at the @entity38 in @entity39 , watched by husband @entity40 , 36 , and another outing at the @entity42 in @entity43			0
but successful though most of her outings have been , it is the @entity3 that are at the forefront of her mind , particularly as @entity2 selectors for @entity50 will be in the crowd			0
day out : @entity52 was cared for by a friend of @entity1 's while she took to the course hot work : @entity1 's @entity9 horse @entity56 was also back in action and will compete in @entity59 next month competing alongside @entity1 in @entity4 will be the rest of the current @entity2 , among them world number one @entity63 and fellow @entity9 medallist @entity64			1
the @entity3 will also see the return of @entity1 's @entity9 horse @entity56 who , like his mistress , has been warming up with smaller @entity69 events at @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
kicking off on the 23rd august , the @entity3 include eight different disciplines , among them eventing , showjumping , dressage and endurance			0
the latter , as the name suggests , involves a 160km race that takes place over the course of a single day with the majority of participants plumping for hardy @entity87 horses			0
