a pro-russian separatist fighting in eastern @entity2 has admitted rebel forces shot down @entity5 flight @entity6 , it has been claimed			1
the militant , who has not been identified , reportedly said fighters blasted the @entity9 out of the sky - killing all 298 people on board - after mistaking it for a @entity2 government cargo plane			1
he said the rebels only realised their mistake when they began searching the crash site for the parachutes of military crew who may have bailed out the aircraft , only to find the bodies of children			1
' we shot down a @entity37 plane , our superiors told us			1
we thought we were looking for baled - out @entity2 pilots but instead we found dead civilians , ' he was quoted as saying			1
' all those poor people with baggage that certainly was n’t military ... i was looking for a parachute and found the body of a little girl , ' he added			2
his sensational admission that rebel forces shot down @entity33 is in stark contrast to other @entity28 forces in the area , who remain insistent that the plane was taken down by government troops			1
this morning @entity57 , prime minister of the self - declared @entity58 , described evidence suggesting rebels had possession of a @entity63 missile launcher as ' fake '			1

the wife of a @entity112 helicopter pilot killed in the @entity6 disaster has been forced to cancel his credit cards because they have been used since the plane went down in @entity2 last week			1

as it emerged that heartless rebels are using victims ' credit cards , answering their phones at the crash site and stealing their belongings - including sentimental items such as jewellery - ms @entity117 's brother @entity135 told @entity136 his sister was stunned to see activity on her husband 's account			1
@entity112 helicopter pilot @entity141 and his wife @entity142 recently moved to @entity79 with their two children ' people are abusing it in the @entity2 ... they have no respect for each other , look what they 're doing , ' mr @entity135 told @entity136			1
' it 's no surprise that they were treating the remains of people like that			0

perhaps 10 minutes earlier , there had been a huge explosion in the sky			0
' the men were allegedly told that white objects had been seen falling from the plane as it plummeted to the earth			1
these were wrongly assumed to have been parachutes and as such the men were told to prepare to fight to round up the military personal they mistakenly believed had been on the flight			1
' all of a sudden , i saw scraps of material in a clearing , ' he was quoted as saying			0
' underneath i found the body of a little girl , who ca n’t have been more than five			0
she was lying face down			0
it was awful , ' the militant added			0

and all these dead people were civilians			2
a heap of burst suitcases confirmed it , ' he went on to say			0

the remains of around 40 international victims of the @entity5 tragedy left @entity2 's @entity271 airport on two military planes , ahead of a painstaking identification process			0

among those attending the solemn ceremony were @entity285 and @entity258 , who held on to each other 's hands as the bodies were removed from the transporter aircraft			1
