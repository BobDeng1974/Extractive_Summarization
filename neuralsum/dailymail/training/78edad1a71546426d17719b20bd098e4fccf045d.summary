' he said : " i ’ve done it and i gave myself a scare " , ' she told the hearing in @entity53			0
mrs @entity8 , who described her son as ' very confident ' in water , said the family had been told that when they were inside the darker of the two caverns they would see a light shining through the water from the next cave			1
challenge : @entity8 drowned while swimming in caves on the coast of the @entity13 island of @entity38			1
he and his family had been exploring the caves and were making their way back to their boat when he failed to emerge from an underwater tunnel instead of swimming between the caves , the family were able to make their way between them by climbing over rocks			1
they were preparing to head back to the boat when @entity8 attempted the swim			1
' i heard @entity24 shout that @entity8 had swum through ( the tunnel ) and he shouted at me to go through to the dark cave and see him come up the other side , ' said mrs @entity8			1
' it was about 10 metres underwater			2
' mrs @entity8 said that prior to diving into the tunnel , @entity8 told his father what he had planned			1
student : @entity8 , who was described by his mother as a ' confident swimmer ' studied maths at @entity96 , @entity2 ' he just said to his dad " i ’m thinking of going back underwater , " and @entity24 said , " do n’t do it " , ' she said			1
' he said he had already done it the other way and it was really easy			0
' he was a very confident swimmer and had done it one way			0
' however , this time @entity8 failed to reappear on the other side of the tunnel , prompting panic among the other family members			1
' i think i just froze a bit , i did n’t know what to do , ' said mrs @entity111			0
' my youngest son ran back to the boat			0
' i do n’t know what happened			0
going from the light cave to the dark cave was obviously very different to going the other way			0
' what he felt was a quite straightforward swim in one direction was n’t as straightforward going the other way			0
' other tourists joined in the search and after around 20 minutes @entity8 ’ body was eventually discovered and pulled from the water			1
he was rushed to hospital but was declared dead shortly after arrival , and a post mortem examination concluded that @entity8 had drowned			1
a @entity13 diving expert said that any attempt to skin dive within the cave tunnels was a ' very dangerous activity '			0

' however , mr @entity134 said that holidaymakers were now expressly told they should not swim in the underwater tunnels			2
assistant @entity33 coroner @entity147 recorded a verdict of accidental death			0
he said : ' it is possible , despite the warning given in the briefing by @entity42 , that @entity8 took this to be a challenge rather than a serious warning against swimming through			1
' speaking after the inquest @entity8 ’s parents said : ' he was living a life of adventure both at unviversity and in his travels and had plans for many more adventures			2
' a decision to swim back through the caves has led him on a different path			0
' @entity8 was very much loved and is very much missed by his friends and family			2
