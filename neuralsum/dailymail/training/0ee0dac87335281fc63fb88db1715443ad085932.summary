by @entity0 @entity1 have enquired about signing @entity3 midfield maestro @entity2 and want teenage @entity5 striker @entity4			2
so far @entity6 have brought in defensive duo @entity7 and @entity8 , but are in major need of strengthening their attack , with @entity12 and @entity13 the only strikers on @entity6 books to date			0
rangers have been alerted to the 18 - year - old @entity4 , who plays for @entity17 , and was also one of the stars at the @entity20 last year			0
@entity22 heaven : could @entity1 pull off a major coup by signing @entity2 and young forward @entity4 ? prolific : rangers are one of a host of clubs interested in signing @entity30 signing @entity28 @entity32 neighbours @entity31 have also expressed an interest in the youngster			1
@entity35 international @entity2 , 29 , has been made an offer by @entity37 but is reluctant to move to @entity38 and is awaiting interest from @entity40			0
elsewhere , @entity1 are also considering a renewed offer for @entity43 's @entity42 and have tabled a bid for @entity28 at @entity30 , but are way short of the £ 10million valuation currently .			1

the @entity1 are in need of attacking *reinforcement* this *summer* and are *eying* up moves for both @entity4 and @entity2
@entity32 neighbours @entity31 are also keen on @entity4 though
@entity1 must match @entity30 's valuation of £ 10million to sign @entity28
