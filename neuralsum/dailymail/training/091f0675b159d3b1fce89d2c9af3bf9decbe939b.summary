by @entity0 published : 08:04 est , 18 november 2013 @entity2 : 11:22 est , 18 november 2013 thefts of @entity4 , tablets and kindles have soared by 10 per cent this year on @entity7 's railways thefts of @entity4 , tablets and kindles on @entity7 's railways have soared this year , while thefts of laptops and computers have gone down			1
this year there was a 10 per cent increase in the number of @entity4 , tablet and @entity21 thefts reported across the @entity7 's rail network , figures obtained under the @entity24 by right - of - centre think - tank @entity26 showed			1
thefts of these items have been increasing year on year since 2008 , according to the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) statistics			1
of the 949 reported @entity4 , @entity31 and @entity21 thefts this year , only 2 per cent were recovered by their owners			1
meanwhile there were 22 per cent fewer laptops and computers stolen on trains this year compared with last year			1
thefts of laptops and computers have decreased each year since 2010			1
of the 1,061 items stolen this year , just 3 per cent were reclaimed			1
@entity41 , professor of criminology at @entity43 , said : ' people steal what they can steal easily and can easily resell for a price that makes the risk worthwhile			0
' laptops and computers often require more effort to gain access to , and their resale has a much narrower market since tablets and @entity11 emerged - their legitimate sales are also falling			2
' he added : ' password protection and other features are ok for reducing the scale of damage , but the potential offender does not know this at the time of theft and so it is not a deterrent until people stop buying stolen ones			0
' with the rise of cloud services , less valuable irreplaceable data is actually held on the machine itself			0
' there was a decrease in the number of mobile phones reported stolen by commuters this year compared with last year			1
before that , the number mobile phone thefts had been increasing each year since 2009			2
this year , 6,436 phones were stolen , of which 2 per cent were reclaimed			2
the figures from the @entity29 show that 22 per cent fewer laptops and computers were stolen this year ( file picture posed by model ) professor @entity41 explained why so few devices are reclaimed : ' people who are insured usually lose interest and have no legal claim once they are paid out			1
' the insurers may need to do more in this regard but they often just write the loss off			0
' @entity93 , director of technology at @entity26 , said : ' the explosion of tablets and shiny new devices is clearly proving a top target for thieves on the transport network			0
' it is vital that consumers are vigilant and transport police impose tough penalties on the criminals targeting hard - working commuters			0
' a @entity29 spokesman said : ' although this year is the ninth consecutive year that crime has fallen , the targeting of high - tech devices such as smartphones and tablets , and organised pickpocketing activity , has created a rise in theft offences			2
' this increase in theft of passenger property , particularly those targeting smartphone and tablets , reflect the growing problem throughout @entity122 and the @entity7			0
' there was also a decrease in the number of mobile phones reported stolen by commuters ( file picture posed by model ) earlier this year , @entity29 launched @entity130 in a bid to crackdown on pickpockets , gadget - grabbers and luggage thieves across the rail network			1
the @entity29 spokesman added : ' indications show that it is having an impact , with the total number of thefts across @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 between april and october this year down 6.1 per cent compared with the same period last year			2
' however , we are not complacent , and we will continue to run @entity130 over the festive period to drive down crime in an increasingly busy environment			0
' the figures cover underground , some metro and tram systems as well as @entity153 services in the @entity7			0
a spokesman for the @entity155 said : ' overall , crime on the railway has fallen but the rise in some crimes will be a cause for concern for passengers so we will continue to work closely with the police to crack down on offenders			0
