@entity0 was left to reflect on ' not a great day ' and fears he will again be at the back of the grid for sunday 's @entity4			1
just three minutes into the first practice session , @entity0 's @entity5 suffered an electrical fault that cut the engine and forced him into a spin at turn one of the @entity11			1
although the car was recovered , his mechanics failed to fix the fault until just before the start of @entity16 , in which three laps in he had to stop out on track as a safety precaution for the engine			2
@entity0 makes his way back to the pits after his @entity5 broke down on friday again the car returned to the garage , and although he made it out on track later in the session , further issues arose that compromised his running			1
the 35 - year - old ultimately finished down in 19th place , sandwiched between @entity35 duo @entity34 and @entity36 , with the best of his 19 laps almost 4.5 seconds off the pace of @entity40 in his @entity41			2
clearly frustrated @entity0 said : ' the guys worked really hard , from @entity43 to @entity44 they did a great job but we still had our problems in @entity44			2
' i went out on the soft tyre but had to quickly come back in , and then i went out on low fuel when everyone else was on high fuel , so it was difficult to get in any running			0
overall not a great day			0
' there was a lot of useful data from the other car ( @entity59 ) , but the frustrating thing is our cars were set up quite differently to get a lot of useful information about parts , and we were n't able to do that on our car			0
' it does n't help either of us for saturday but hopefully we 've resolved the issues i 've had			0
' team members recover @entity0 's @entity5 in the pit - lane during the first free practice @entity0 , though , knows the teams ahead of a struggling @entity5 will all turn up the gas in qualifying , which is likely to leave only the @entity35 boys behind the @entity77 and @entity59 , as was the case in @entity79 on sunday			1
' i think some teams were on high fuel all day as well , so it 's not going to be an easy weekend , ' added @entity0			1
' but we 're not kidding ourselves , we know it 's going to be a tricky qualifying session and i suppose for us at the moment we 're going to qualify near the back			1
' in reality it 's not such a problem			0
the race pace is something that is more important			0
