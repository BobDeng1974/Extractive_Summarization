by @entity1 reporter published : 20:09 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 21:01 est , 24 january 2014 human rights campaigners have called for the immediate release of a @entity6 man sentenced to death under @entity9 's blasphemy laws			1
a judge convicted and sentenced @entity11 , from @entity12 , on thursday following a trial			1
mr @entity11 was arrested in 2010 in @entity14 , near the capital @entity16 , for claiming to be the @entity17 in letters sent to various officials , according to prosecutor @entity20			1
strict : scores of people have been arrested in @entity9 under the country 's harsh blasphemy laws , which carry sentences of life in prison or the death penalty , though executions are rarely carried out but a lawyer who defended mr @entity11 said he suffers from mental illness and the case was really a property dispute			1
@entity35 's deputy asia pacific director @entity34 said : ' @entity11 is now facing the gallows simply for writing a series of letters			2
he does not deserve punishment			0
no one should be charged on the basis of this sort of conduct			0
' the blasphemy laws undermine the rule of law , and people facing charges risk death and other harm in detention			2
' @entity9 must immediately release @entity51 and reform its blasphemy laws to ensure that this will not happen again			1
' mr @entity11 , a @entity6 citizen of @entity9 origin , returned to @entity9 in 2010 after being treated for paranoid schizophrenia in @entity12 , the lawyer said			1
he later fell into a dispute with a tenant who brought the blasphemy complaint against him to police			0
@entity35 called on @entity9 prime minster @entity61 to release @entity11 a doctor treating mr @entity11 in @entity12 said in a letter dated june 2011 that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and believed that the @entity9 and @entity6 governments were attempting to control him			1
the letter was provided to @entity67 by his lawyer , who asked not to be named for fear of threats and violence			0
prosecutors disputed that mr @entity51 had mental problems			2
the @entity74 in @entity16 said it was aware of mr @entity11 's case and provided assistance to him			2
lawyers said they will appeal against the conviction , and that they are worried about his mental condition and physical safety in prison			0
another @entity6 citizen , @entity83 , of the @entity84 , was imprisoned in november 2012 for reciting a passage from the @entity86 , a prohibited act for @entity84 under the country 's blasphemy laws			2
ms @entity34 said : " the @entity9 authorities must immediately and unconditionally release both @entity11 and @entity83 and guarantee their safety and that of their families			1
several individuals have been attacked , some even killed following charges of blasphemy			0
' at a time when @entity9 is reeling from a spate of abuses which perpetrators seek to justify as a defence of religious sentiments , reform of the blasphemy laws is more urgent than ever			1
' a @entity105 spokesman said : " we 're concerned about this case and can confirm that we have been in touch with the @entity109 who will keep us informed of the situation			0
' the @entity105 strongly opposes the death penalty in all circumstances			0
as a minimum we would urge the @entity9 authorities to abide by the moratorium they have on the death penalty			0
' our thoughts are with mr @entity11 's family at this difficult time			2
' scores of people have been arrested in @entity9 under the country 's harsh blasphemy laws , which carry sentences of life in prison or the death penalty , though executions are rarely carried out			1
rights groups say the laws often are exploited for personal gain and that members of @entity9 's minority population are disproportionately targeted			1
people accused of blasphemy also have been attacked and killed by angry vigilante mobs			0
few leaders in the predominantly @entity138 country have shown willingness to tackle the contentious issue , especially after two prominent politicians who criticised the blasphemy law were murdered in recent years			0
one of the politicians was shot by his own bodyguard , who then attracted adoring crowds .			0

@entity11 was accused of claiming to be the @entity17
@entity149 disputed mental illness , and judge convicted him *yesterday*
