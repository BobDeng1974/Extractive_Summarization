@entity0 has the legend of the @entity2			0
does a community 150 miles farther up the @entity4 have a @entity5 buried in an unmarked cemetery from the 18th century ? in the middle of the @entity4 sits @entity8 , site of a 34 - acre parcel considered the birthplace of today 's @entity11			1
the town and village of @entity14 had long sought purchase of the land and with its completion also gained control of an unmarked colonial - era cemetery that could hold the remains of hundreds of people , including some of the famous frontier fighters known as @entity23			1
local @entity24 walks through the colonial - era cemetery on @entity8 in @entity14 , @entity26 the cemetery could hold the remains of hundreds of people , including some of the group called @entity23 @entity30 uncovered seven skeletons , all of which were intact â€” except one that was missing its skull			1
it could n't be determined if that body was originally buried without its head in 2006 , a local couple who served as caretakers for the then - privately owned property uncovered seven human skeletons buried at the site , including one that was missing its skull			1
state archaeologist later determined the burials were likely part of cemetery dating back to the @entity50 ( 1754 - 63 ) , when @entity14 was @entity52 's largest fortification in @entity53			1
the skeletons were reburied where they were found , and no excavations have been conducted at the site since			1
but six weeks after closing on the decade - long effort to purchase the island property , local officials are starting to think about what 's needed to turn the overgrown , undeveloped parcel into a public park that will draw tourists to this economically struggling riverside community 45 miles north of @entity65			1
the immediate plans will include trails and signage detailing @entity14 's key role in the war that set the stage for the @entity72			1
so far there have been no discussions on whether to leave the burial site alone or allow archaeologists to return and search for more graves			0
' there 's not going to be any digging right now , ' said @entity24 , a restaurant owner who serves on the town board			0
' i 'm sure down the road there will be discussions about that			0
we just want to get a basic road map of how to move forward			0
' more than 250 years ago , @entity8 was part of a sprawling @entity52 fortification that was home to more than 16,000 @entity52 and colonial @entity53 soldiers and civilians , making it the third - largest city in the 13 colonies , behind only @entity94 and @entity95			2
the island , named for maj. @entity97 of @entity98 , was the base of operations for the frontiersmen he led on scouting and raiding missions in the northern forest			0
a plaque remembers those buried in the colonial - era cemetery on @entity8 in 1757 , after a string of @entity52 military disasters , @entity97 wrote his ' rules of @entity111 , ' 28 guidelines for waging guerrilla warfare in the @entity53 wilderness			2
they 've since been revised and shortened to 19 by the @entity11 , who still use them to train @entity23 candidates at @entity119 , @entity120			2
the @entity23 consider @entity14 , especially @entity8 , to be hallowed ground			2
state archaeologist @entity122 led the team that examined the skeletons after they were found eight years ago			2
she said all seven were intact , except one that was missing its skull			1
it could n't be determined if that body was originally buried without its head , @entity122 said			1
none of the skeletons have been identified			0
if they are from the @entity50 , it 's likely they were either @entity136 militiamen or @entity52 regulars , or possibly some of the hundreds of @entity23 encamped at @entity14 during the war , said @entity139 , who has led archaeological digs here since the early 1990s but never found the cemetery			0
' very few @entity50 cemeteries have been located , ' @entity139 said			0
' after years of archaeology on that island , we always wondered where the dead soldiers might be			0
' a plaque from the cemetery marks the location where the rangers were found			0
