by @entity0 a ‘ sprightly ’ 94 - year - old admitted to hospital with a minor injury died from a brain haemorrhage after a series of catastrophic errors by experienced staff , an inquest heard			1
former civil servant @entity8 suffered a fatal head injury at the @entity10 in @entity11 , south east @entity12 , while receiving treatment for a minor fall and infection			1
despite staff being aware of her potentially life - threatening condition , they failed to notice that her health was deteriorating dangerously until it was too late , the inquest heard			1
@entity8 , 94 , died of a brain haemorrhage after falling and hitting her head in a hospital ward the much - loved widow had been left alone in a room off a busy ward and had been allowed to sleep - a warning sign that she needed urgent medical attention for a cranial fracture , the hearing was told			1
her family said they have been left ‘ gutted ’ by the mistakes that led to her death			2
mrs @entity8 had spent two days on the hospital ’s @entity34 ( @entity36 ) where she was being treated for dehydration and an infection in early 2012			2
she had come to the hospital previously after falling at home , and was classed as a ‘ medium ’ fall risk by hospital procedures , the inquest heard			1
under the guidelines nurses need to be aware of where patients such as @entity47 are at all times , explain the risk to them and contact their relatives			2
in the early morning of january 29 , @entity47 , who had no history of dementia according to her gp , fell while walking around the ward and hit her head just after 3am			1
@entity47 ( pictured with her friend , @entity58 ) was admitted to @entity10 , @entity11 , with a minor injury after falling at home but she never left the hospital earlier that day she had been adamant that she return home to her sheltered flat in @entity66 , south east @entity12 , telling staff : ‘ i ca n’t stay here all day , i need to get things done			1
’ she was sent for a ct scan of her head and staff were expected to carry out regular ‘ neurological observations ’ as a precaution until a doctor was satisfied that brain scans showed she was ok			2
however , nurses did not follow handover procedures and paperwork correctly , and the careful attention she required was missed			2
horribly bruised , mrs @entity8 was eventually given a bed in a room off the ward , where she was left to fall asleep			1
nurse @entity82 , who was caring for @entity47 , said she failed to raise the alarm until she ‘ vomited big ’			0
the nurse said : ‘ the situation then was , because i did not want to disturb her at that time			0
i was n’t worried much about her condition			0
’ she had been tasked with checking her condition hourly but instead left her to sleep until checking on her at 16.30 that afternoon , the inquest heard			1
when mrs @entity8 hit her head , nurses failed to check on her so did not notice her condition was deteriorating she said : ‘ by the time i went back there initially she was coughing and threw up big , then i was really worried			1
’ mrs @entity8 died the next day , with a post-mortem examination showing the cause of death as pneumonia and a haemorrhage from a fractured skull			1
nurses responsible for looking after @entity47 at the time admitted at an inquest at @entity105 that there had been mistakes , but blamed the tragic lapse on a lack of available staff to take care of a number of ‘ confused ’ elderly patients wandering around the unit			1
they claimed that rules about restraining patients meant that the accident would have been difficult to prevent and other measures would have been a greater risk			0
during questioning by assistant coroner for @entity123 , @entity124 , the team responsible for @entity47 ’s care said they had learned from her death			0
senior charge nurse @entity126 , who was in charge of the ward on the morning of january 29 , said he ‘ would n’t do the same again ’			0
by the time nurses realised how ill mrs @entity8 was , it was too late to save her and she died the next day when asked about the problem with staffing , he said : ‘ i can say it ’s much better now			1
‘ it has been increased now from what we originally did			0
’ he added that more staff were booked as a precaution			0
however , @entity139 , a physiotherapist who had treated @entity47 , said there was ‘ no way ’ of avoiding cases like hers , adding : ‘ everything that we could have had in place was in place at that time			0
’ speaking outside the hearing @entity8 ’s niece , @entity150 , 50 , who is herself a bowel cancer nurse at the @entity153 in @entity154 , described her disbelief at the errors			2
she said : ‘ i just feel gutted as despite being profoundly deaf she still had an active social life with her friends and family			0
‘ i thought that whoever had been looking after her was junior and not very experienced			0
‘ however , they were both clearly experienced nurses who had been on the ward some time			2
to find out that they had n’t grasped the severity or the potential severity of the decisions they have made , it ’s horrible			0
‘ as a nurse myself it is drilled into us that you check on your patients , you follow the procedures , it ’s your pin badge on the line or you end up somewhere like this			0
’ the hearing continues .			0

@entity8 went to @entity10 , @entity11 , with minor injury
during the night she fell over on a ward and hit her head
nurses then failed to notice that her condition was deteriorating
they left her to fall asleep in a room by herself and did *n't* check on her
by the time they realised she was seriously ill it was to late to save her
an inquest heard she died of pneumonia and a brain haemorrhage
