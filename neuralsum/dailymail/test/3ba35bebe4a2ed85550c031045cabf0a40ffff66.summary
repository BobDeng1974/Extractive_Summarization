the @entity11 page of the so - called @entity12 has sparked an internet firestorm as thousands of mothers share , and comment on , the group 's anti-cesarean memes , expressing their disgust at the outrageous messages they express ; the community , led by father @entity21 , is using the images to encourage fellow @entity23 to shame ' lazy ' and ' negligent ' mothers who have elected to undergo c - sections			1
' face the facts : you did n't really give birth			0
you caught a lucky break			0
please show respect to superior women who actually had what it took to get the job done , ' reads one of the group 's @entity11 memes , which has been shared nearly 80,000 times since it was posted on sunday			1
alarming message : this controversial anti-cesarean meme posted on the @entity12 of the @entity42 's @entity11 page on sunday has been shared nearly 80,000 times propaganda : the religious community claims women will be ' cast into the lake of fire ' if they undergo a c - section ' good advice from @entity49 on behalf of @entity50 of @entity51 , ' the @entity12 captioned the controversial image featuring a woman 's c - section scar			1

' although some reporters claimed to have spoken with mr @entity21 , many question the existence of the extreme religious community and the validity of its messages			2
and while it remains unclear as to whether or not the page was created with the sole intention of inciting fury , its most recent postings have taken the internet by storm			2
not scientific : this meme alleges that women who avoid vaccination are ' more likely ' to have a natural vaginal birth public shaming : this meme featuring a mom in a bikini states that women should n't flaunt their stomachs after having cesarean sections because they did n't take care of themselves while they were pregnant scare tactics : the community added this picture caption to the meme to remind women that @entity66 is always ' watching ' and ' judging ' thousands of women are sharing their stories and reasons for undergoing c - sections in the comment sections of the images , which claim there is ' no medical need ' for cesareans			1
' i am proud to have had a c - section ! i was in labor for 3 days , ' @entity114 wrote today			1
' we found out my baby was stuck on my pelvis face up ! if they would have simply moved her giving birth naturally i could have killed her ! [ sic ] ' @entity122 asked : ' how is it a lucky break ? getting a c - section means that the baby 's and or the mother 's life is in danger			1
' she continued : ' birth is a miracle			0
it should not be played down or slandered like this group has done			2
it 's a disgrace to women everywhere for this group to post such a hurtful and tactless post			2
it does n't matter how one gives birth			0
all that matters is that there is birth of new life and everyone is safe and healthy			0
' not true : this controversial meme claims that women who have c - sections ' do so because of decades of drug abuse and alcohol dependence ' unfair claims : the @entity12 of the @entity42 also believe that there is ' no medial need ' for cesarean sections when giving birth outrageous accusation : the group called women who have c - sections ' lazy ' parents ' @entity160 is bliss			1
may @entity66 forgive your stupidity , ' @entity162 added			0
and @entity165 noted : ' 8,304 ppl liked this post ? see , to me , that 's the scariest part ... [ sic ] ' meanwhile , others are breathing new life into old petitions looking to remove the group 's page from @entity11 because of its history of ' severe hate speech ' and ' sexism '			1
2,500 new supporters have joined one online petition on @entity180 today			0
' i am signing this because of the hatred and condemnation they give to mothers who were not able to have a ' natural vaginal ' birth and they are saying anyone who did not have this type of birth was due to drugs or ' being a little w * * * * , ' one woman from @entity182 explained			0
nothing new : the @entity195 has a history of being accused of being sexist and hateful towards women dangerous thinking : the religious group claims that sticking to gender stereotypes is the key to a healthy and happy household impressionable minds : this disturbing image was allegedly drawn by a child and shared on the group 's @entity206 page , which was created for younger members of the sect she continued : ' this is very demeaning to women and mothers			1
it also makes claims that any mother who chose a c - section committed a @entity218 and should have refused it even if it mean death for both the mother and child			1
' @entity195 currently runs numerous pro-life , pro-gun @entity223 accounts and @entity11 pages including @entity226 and @entity206 , a community for its younger members , which features disturbing religious images allegedly created by children			1
one picture , which was posted in february , shows @entity232 smiling while surrounded by guns			2

none more precious than the @entity66 given right to bear arms			0
every firearm is an extension of his hand			0
every round like a heavenly embrace from @entity232 himself , upon your adversary , ' the group had captioned the controversial drawing			2
violent thoughts : this childlike drawing shows @entity232 smiling as he is surrounded by guns and a bloody knife loaded message : the picture was accompanied by this caption , which alleges that ' every firearm is an extension ' of @entity66 's hand family affair : this photo of three young boys brandishing guns was shared on @entity266 militia page , which is also run by the religious community			1
