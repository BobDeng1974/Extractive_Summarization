by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has no intention of quitting @entity4 just yet as he is determined to end his career on a high			1
@entity2 is fast approaching a crossroads , however , as his contract with @entity8 expires at the end of this season			1
at present the team are not competitive following a run of three successive races without scoring a point for the first time since 2009			2
fitting : @entity2 and girlfriend @entity16 wear special commemorative pink t - shirts in memory of his father @entity19 , who died earlier this year crossroads : @entity2 's contract with @entity8 ends at the end of the season however , with @entity24 due to return as their power unit supplier from 2015 , there is naturally considerable excitement and optimism within @entity8			1
one of the great unknowns , though , is whether they will be quick out of the box , or whether it will take them at least a season or two to get up to speed			0
with @entity2 now 34 , he is quickly running out of opportunities to win a second world championship , so does he stay - if offered a new deal - or go ? it is a tough dilemma for the @entity36 , but one certainty is he will not be calling time on @entity4 at the end of this season			1
' i definitely want to be in @entity4			0
this sort of season does not make you want to retire , ' said @entity2			1
' if you do retire , you want to retire on a high and if you have the possibility to do that , then you continue racing to get that high			0
@entity44 : @entity2 wants @entity8 to be true to their word and build competitive car ' the problem then is when you do that you do n't want to stop racing either , so you could be racing for many years			1
' but no , i do n't feel i want to retire at the end of this year			2
i am happy about my future , and think it is quite exciting			0
' now in his fifth season with @entity8 , @entity2 would naturally love to remain with a team he knows have the resources to get him back to the front			1
but as he points out , there is one over-riding factor , adding : ' the biggest problem is i need to be in a car that is competitive , that gives you confidence as a driver as well			2
i hope that 's here			0
' it is a difficult decision for a driver in my position , with so much experience and so much to give ' i 'm at the point in my career where i 've only a few years left where i will be in @entity4 , and i want to be in a position where i can win races or be close to winning races			0
' i would like to think i 'll be here and the team will be competitive towards the end of this season , which will then give me good reason to want to be here			0
' glory days : @entity2 was @entity80 in 2009 , driving for @entity81 @entity2 also appreciates there are few top seats available , with no driver movement likely unless someone is axed or decides to quit			2
it is why he feels it is imperative @entity8 remain true to their word and they do turn their campaign around by building a fast car			1
' we have to be quick towards the end of this year if we want to be quick next year because there are no regulation changes , so we have to stay focused , ' said @entity2			1
' we are not suddenly going to find two seconds over the winter			0
' i know @entity97 ( @entity98 , @entity99 ceo ) has said he wants to win races this year , but that is going to be very , very difficult			0
' i know why he is saying it because he understands we have to be quicker this year if we 've a chance of being quick next year			0
' that 's why there is a big push , and we wo n't let up like perhaps @entity108 will once they have a 300 - point lead ! '			2

@entity2 's contract with @entity8 ends in the *summer*
the 34 - year - old wants to stay with @entity8 but needs a competitive car
@entity8 will be *boosted* by @entity24 's return as *engine* supplier in 2015
