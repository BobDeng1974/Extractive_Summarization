by @entity0 for @entity1 a woman watching the football at home with her family said she got the surprise of her life when one of their snacks was n't quite what they had bargained for			1
@entity12 , from @entity13 in the @entity14 , said she and her family were having a few quiet drinks on sunday afternoon when her dad opened up a packet of beef jerky			1
' we were just having a few beers watching the footy , and he grabbed a packet of jerky out ' , ms @entity12 told @entity1			1
a darwin family got a nasty surprise when they discovered a dried cane toad in their beef jerky without even realising it her dad then reached into the packet , and apparently pulled out a cane toad and took a bite out of one of its legs			1
' he said it was really crunchy and had a really nasty taste ' , ms @entity12 continued			0
' it was n't beef jerky at all			1
' she said fortunately she was not the one to take a bite , but her father was n't so lucky			0
describing it as ' absolutely putrid ' the @entity13 woman told @entity48 her family were disgusted by the gruesome discovery			2
her father was apparently so engrossed in the football he did n't realise what he had eaten until it was too late			0
@entity12 described it as ' absolutely putrid ' and said her father bit into the toad without realising cane toads produce poison through its parotid gland and some parts of its body are poisonous for many species including humans			2
ms @entity12 said her father had n't suffered any illness from ingesting the toad			2
however as cane toads continue to populate the @entity14 , some cooks have decided to take the opportunity to create their own delicacy from them			0

some cooks in the @entity14 have taken to cooking up the poisonous pests @entity13 food blogger @entity76 said earlier this year the cane toad was overlooked as a food source			1
ms @entity76 's blog – growing and @entity80 – is part of a community project that focuses on using locally grown foods			0
she and other members of the @entity86 community have come up with many recipes that incorporate the pest , and have developed ways to kill the animal so it releases the least amount of poison possible			0
she and other members of a food blog have created dishes that incorporate the cane toad 's legs			2
