by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 breaks all the political rules to boast about his smoking , drinking and visiting lapdancing clubs			2
the @entity8 leader has built a reputation for plain - speaking and saying too much which endears him to voters and infuriates his opponents			1
but there is one subject he hates discussing : his wife @entity17 , a ‘ stunning ’ @entity18 - born bond trader who hates the limelight as much as he delights in it			2
@entity8 leader @entity2 loves the limelight , but his @entity18 - born wife @entity23 is rarely seen in public @entity26 is known of mrs @entity2 , few photographs exist and she is rarely seen in public : and that ’s how mr @entity2 would like to keep it			1
it is one of the great contradictions of the @entity8 leader that while he rails against @entity33 ‘ coming over here ’ and taking the jobs , homes and public services of @entity37 that he is married to a @entity18 who could move here under the rules which he wants to tear up			1
he jokes that being married to a foreigner is proof that he loves @entity33			0
but wisecracks were not enough to get him out of facing difficult questions about why he employs his wife on the taxpayer			0
@entity50 - born @entity23 keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public			2
at @entity8 conferences , she sits anonymously in the audience			0
she and mr @entity2 met in @entity55 in 1996 , while he was travelling on business - and still married to his first wife , @entity57 , the mother of his eldest two children			1
of the moment he met @entity23 , he once said : ‘ she was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance			2
' she could have stepped into a @entity66 painting no questions asked			0
’ mr @entity2 was challenged about employing his wife @entity23 during a walkabout in @entity70 later , he explained in typically flamboyant style : ‘ my marriage , which had been on ice and torpid with its claws bound for so long we had both forgotten it was alive at all , finally expired			1
’ the couple divorced in 1997 and mr @entity2 married @entity23 in 1999			1
@entity23 , gave up her career in the @entity79 , where she worked as an interpreter for a @entity18 bank , to look after the children - she and mr @entity2 have two - and take her husband ’s correspondence			1
she writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers			0
she is paid a salary by the @entity88 of more than £ 27,000 and has amassed more than £ 200,000 since she began working for him			0
she works from home and rarely visits @entity8 ’s hq in @entity92 ’s @entity91 , which she has described as a ‘ freak show ’			2
yesterday the arrangement caught up with him , as he made the bizarre claim that no @entity96 could do that job , ‘ unless they were married to me '			0
‘ i do n’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day , ’ he said			0
mr @entity2 said his wife earned a ‘ very modest ’ wage and worked ‘ extremely unsociable hours ’ for ‘ up to ’ seven days a week			1
former @entity8 mep @entity104 accused mr @entity2 in the @entity88 of paying both his wife and ' former mistress ' @entity107 using taxpayers ' money			1
mr @entity2 denies having an affair with miss @entity107 in 2005 there were reports of a seven times - a - night tryst with a @entity115 woman in @entity116 , which led to @entity118 colleagues presenting him with a can of @entity120 to celebrate			1
he has at times dismissed the claims as ‘ nonsense ’ but in his memoirs recalled the encounter : ‘ i met her in a pub and accepted her invitation home for a drink			2
she was sleek and seductive and i will not splutter that after the first bottle i would necessarily have behaved like sir @entity132			0
’ @entity104 @entity133 , mr @entity2 's @entity134 flatmate , has claimed the @entity8 leader 's weakness is women then last month former @entity8 mep @entity104 challenged the @entity8 leader in the @entity88 over claims he employs both his wife and ‘ former mistress ’ @entity107 on the taxpayer			1
both mr @entity2 and ms @entity107 , a @entity8 press aide , deny they had an affair			1
mr @entity2 dismissed the claims as ‘ absolute nonsense ’			1
@entity23 is said to be ‘ pretty cheesed off ’ about the claims			0
in a rare appearance in public she told reporters outside the family ’s large semi-detached home near @entity153 , @entity154 : ' @entity2 's just on his way back from @entity156 and we will be discussing it tonight , i 'm sure			2
’ in an interview after the claims emerged , mr @entity2 gave his own account			1
asked if he had sex with ms @entity107 , he replied : ‘ i do n’t think we should go into the grisly details			0
’ has he slept with her ? ‘ no. ’ has he kissed her ? ‘ no. when you work in a tight team , i understand why people might get the wrong idea			0
’ it did not help that days earlier @entity133 , his @entity134 flatmate and former @entity8 colleague , had declared in characteristically colourful language : ‘ we all have our foibles and our weaknesses – mine is real ale , i ’ve never been partial to crumpet			2
' @entity2 ’s is women			0
it ’s not something he ever denied			0
’ in fact , @entity23 is said to have played a part in mr @entity133 being kicked out of the party			2
she was in the room at a @entity8 conference fringe event for women when mr @entity133 famously described guests as ‘ sluts ’			1
she is said to have been unimpressed , and hours later mr @entity133 was suspended from the party for upstaging mr @entity2 ’s keynote speech			1
in @entity8 the focus must be on the leader at all times , and the attention on his long - suffering wife will be making for uncomfortable reading for them both			1
@entity8 leader @entity2 was put on the spot about whether his @entity18 wife had taken a job which could have gone to a @entity96			1
@entity204 political editor @entity203 challenged him to explain why he employed @entity23 as a secretary on a taxpayer - funded salary from @entity134			0
mr @entity2 insisted that ' nobody else could do that job ' , which included checking emails for him at midnight			2
‘ i do n’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day , ' he said			0
but a fake advert for a similar role placed by an employment agency on its website attracted 764 applications in just 12 hours - 649 of them from @entity221 @entity220 ' @entity219 ' , it stipulated that applicants ' must be able to work long and some unsociable hours up to seven days a week ' and described the pay as ' modest '			0
it identified the employer as @entity8 , which it described as ' a @entity229 right - wing populist political party in the @entity221 '			0
@entity230 , director of @entity231 , said : ' with our knowledge of the @entity221 and @entity33 employment market , we just knew that what @entity2 was saying was not true			0
' there are lots of highly - qualified @entity237 looking for work and many would jump at the chance to work for a politician such as @entity2 , perhaps seeing it as a stepping stone to a similar role with mps or ministers			0
asked whether a @entity221 person could take the position as his secretary , mr @entity2 insisted : ‘ nobody else could do that job , not unless they were married to me			1
’ mr @entity2 said his wife earned a ‘ very modest ’ wage and worked ‘ extremely unsociable hours ’ for ‘ up to ’ seven days a week .			1
