by @entity0 published : 04:49 est , 25 september 2012 updated : 06:00 est , 25 september 2012 a restaurant has unveiled the largest chilli cheese hotdog in @entity3 with 13,000 calories - that 's six times a woman 's recommended daily intake			2
at over one metre - long and filled with 1.5kgs of beef sausage , a whole pound of homemade chilli and lashings of cheese , the @entity9 at @entity10 in @entity11 , near @entity12 , contains an estimated 13,000 calories			1
it is more than five times the daily recommended allowance of 2,500 calories for a man			0
@entity23 , 23 front of house manager , prepares to tuck into the massive hotdog that measures over one metre long the gastronomic gauntlet is the latest in what the eatery hopes will be a long line of food challenges and follows the creation of the 3lb cheeseburger , which has yet to be successfully tackled by any contender			1
@entity34 , 30 , director of @entity35 ’s , said he began seeking out a new challenge following his customers failed attempts to complete the @entity39			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve had people asking us for weeks when it ’s going to come out and if it ’s ready yet			0
‘ we ’ve spent ages developing the prototypes and we ’ve had a lot of fun trying them out			0
the most any of the guys here have managed to eat is about half of one			0
‘ the real struggle was in sourcing a really big sausage and eventually we got a local butcher to supply the meat which he uses to fill extra large sausage skins ordered especially from @entity58			0
‘ it ’s pure beef sausage			0
we wanted to make sure the ingredients were of a really high quality because if you ’re going to eat that much of something it has to taste good			0
’ the @entity9 boasts a massive 1,000 grams of fat as opposed to the modest 70 grams recommended as part of woman 's recommended daily intake , and 100 grams recommended for a man			1
the chefs help lift up the latest challenge , which is more than a couple of handfuls , to @entity75 the restaurant 's latest challenge contains a whopping 34,274 mgs of salt and 523 grams of saturated fat it also contains a whopping 34,274 mgs of salt			2
with 80 people so far having attempted - and failed - to overcome the gut - busting burger , it is unlikely anyone will manage to complete a whole @entity9 in the near future			1
@entity34 said : ‘ both the burger and the hotdog are £ 29.95 or free if you eat it in an hour			0
‘ when we made the burger i had a load of t - shirts printed that said “ i conquered the @entity39 ” and i still have all of them			1
‘ i wish i ’d got a bunch that said , “ i was defeated by the @entity39 ” because i could have sold dozens of them			2
’ the restaurant launched the challenges after enjoying the hit @entity105 show @entity103 , in which presenter @entity106 travels the @entity105 seeking out the biggest food challenges			2
@entity34 , who runs the restaurant with business partners @entity110 , 31 , @entity112 , 27 and @entity113 , 22 , believes the @entity9 is the biggest in @entity3 , dwarfing the competition			1
however , it has a long way to go to beat the current world ’s longest meat hot dog record holder , measured at 203.8 m and manufactured by @entity120 of @entity121			0
the unconquered @entity39 - a 3lb cheeseburger containing three pounds of minced beef , 12 rashers of bacon , a dozen slices of cheese and 12 onion rings , served with chips and coleslaw			1

the creation of the new @entity9 follows the *popularity* of so far unconquered @entity39
the restaurant hopes to create a string of *giant* eating challenges
