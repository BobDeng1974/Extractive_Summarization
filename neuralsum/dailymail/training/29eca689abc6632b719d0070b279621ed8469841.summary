by @entity0 published : 01:11 est , 11 march 2013 updated : 01:11 est , 11 march 2013 it sounds like the premise for a new reality tv series : ' @entity4 ' - people scouring waterside communities looking to buy homes damaged by @entity8 at a deep discount			1
while there are bargains out there , ranging from 10 per cent off pre-storm prices for upscale homes on @entity17 's @entity16 and the @entity18 to as much as 60 per cent off modest bungalows in @entity20 and @entity21 , it 's still very much a game of buyer beware			1
not only are buyers are on the hook for repairs and in some cases total rebuilds , they 're also wading into a host of potentially expensive uncertainties about new flood maps and future insurance rates , zoning changes and updated building codes			2
one man 's junk ... : some @entity8 - damaged homes are being sold at a song for opportunists looking to get some prime real estate at a fraction of the cost worth the price ? buyers are on the hook for repairs and in some cases total rebuilds for the properties purchased , as well as new flood maps and future insurance rates , zoning changes and updated building codes ' it 's totally changed the way i sell real estate , ' said @entity55 , a sales associate with @entity56 , whose own @entity58 , @entity59 , office was wrecked in the storm			1
prior to @entity8 , prospective buyers rarely mentioned issues such as flood maps and building elevations until the matter of flood insurance came up - often at closing			1
' now , everybody asks the question of elevation , ' @entity55 said			2
even if potential buyers plan to tear down and build new , they ask about the pending changes in flood maps proposed by the @entity75 , because flood insurance rates will depend upon the new zones			2
there is no sign of a mass exodus from shoreline communities			2
the number of for - sale listings in january in the 380 zip codes hit by the storm was about 2 per cent below the same time last year , according to online real estate information company @entity87 that indicates that most homeowners are rebuilding , or have not yet decided how to proceed			1
sell or rebuild ? the number of for - sale listings in january in the 380 zip codes hit by @entity8 was about 2 per cent below the same time last year , indicating homeowners ' possible desire to rebuild buyer beware : new listings range from destroyed oceanfront properties being sold for the land , to flooded bayside homes untouched since the storm that must be gutted but real estate agents in @entity17 and @entity59 say the majority of homes for sale in these areas have some damage from the october 29 storm , and it appears to them that a rising number are being put on the market as the spring home - buying season approaches			1
new listings range from destroyed oceanfront properties being sold for the land , to flooded bayside homes untouched since the storm that must be gutted			1
even the few undamaged homes in affected neighborhoods are listing at prices about 10 per cent lower than they would have been pre-storm			1
some sellers are overwhelmed by the daunting prospect of restoring a damaged home			1
some are older homeowners who had stayed in the houses where they raised their families , but now are relocating			1
some did n't have flood insurance			2
despair : some sellers are overwhelmed by the daunting prospect of restoring a damaged home ' they either do n't have the funds or do n't have the energy to go through the renovating and rebuilding process , ' said @entity132 , a broker with @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity59			1
@entity135 , broker and owner of @entity137 in the @entity139 section of @entity21 , @entity17 , said a number of her new listings are homes owned by senior citizens			0
one 85 - year - old client was living alone in her 1940s - era six - bedroom , six - bath brick home right on the beach			0
the house was hammered by @entity8 , and must be at least partially demolished , but will still command a hefty price			1
' everything on the water is big money , ' @entity149 said			0
but the $ 3million listing price is nevertheless a huge discount from the roughly $ 4.25million it would have commanded before the storm			0
another set of sellers were in the process of getting out before the storm hit			0
questions : in places like @entity58 , @entity59 , pictured , try to rebuild , prospective homebuyers are often asking about elevation and flood insurance fixer upper : @entity8 has forced some desirable beachfront homes to become much more affordable , if the buyer is willing to do some work @entity149 had 18 properties in contract prior to @entity8 , but all of those sales either fell through or were renegotiated for a lower price			1
one 1930s - era three - bedroom , two - bath house with a view of the bay was in contract for $ 665,000 , but the entire first floor was gutted after it took on about four feet of water			0
the buyer , a single woman , was unwilling to take on the renovations			0
the property is back on the market for $ 550,000			0
that 's a 17 per cent discount , but the eventual buyer will have to pay for new floors and walls , plus a new kitchen and bathroom			1
still , that sort of cut might make the neighborhood affordable for a family that was priced out in recent years , when houses were selling for $ 750,000 and more			1
repairs : some homebuyers are looking into the opportunity to turn a home gutted by the storm into their beachfront dream house and in one sense , buying a storm - damaged home can offer an advantage , said @entity208 , president of the @entity210 / @entity209 in the @entity211 of @entity212 , where damaged houses are selling for about 10 per cent less than before the storm			1
' if it 's all gutted out , you can do what you want , ' he said			0
' you can own the house with a brand new kitchen , new appliances , new floors			0
' in addition to people looking to create their dream house out of a damaged home , @entity208 has seen investors eyeing the area			1
in @entity212 's @entity230 neighborhood , for example , investors are looking to tear down gutted 1920s - era ranch homes and build bigger houses with multiple stories at higher elevations in their place			1
the shorefront sections of @entity20 are also seeing accelerating turnover of homes that are likely to eventually get torn down			0
@entity239 , a broker with @entity240 , recently sold three adjacent bungalows owned by a longtime resident of @entity20 's @entity243 for $ 240,000 cash - about $ 20,000 less than each one might have garnered before the storm			0
' the homeowner refused to go back , ' she said			0
another chance : investors have also been seen dishing out cash for what they hope is a big payoff for properties that bared the brunt of @entity8 the buyer will fix the properties up and rent them ' until the dust settles , ' @entity239 said			1
once new flood maps are finalized and new building codes sorted out , she expects the houses to be sold again to a developer who will replace them			2
cash deals are the only ones closing right now in @entity20 's storm - damaged neighborhoods , @entity239 said , which means the buyers are almost all investors , even though the area 's small houses are selling for $ 85,000 to $ 100,000			1
' banks are not going to lend , ' she said			0
' the banks are waiting for the dust to settle to see what the building requirements are going to be			0
' the new flood maps must go through public hearings before they are finalized , a process likely to take two to three years			0
meanwhile , public officials and homeowners are trying to look to the future			2
new beginning : listings in @entity17 and @entity59 range from destroyed oceanfront properties being sold for the land , to flooded bayside homes untouched since the storm that must be gutted @entity17 gov @entity287 recently announced a plan to buy out the entire @entity20 neighborhood of @entity291 and allow the land to revert back to the marshland it once was , because the homes there have flooded multiple times			2
it remains unclear if any other neighborhoods might get bought out			0
that may be the best hope for homeowners like @entity303 , who has been trying to sell his bungalow in @entity20 's @entity306 section , which was ripped off its foundation by the 14 - foot storm surge			2
a buyout would be attractive because , instead of dealing with bargain hunters , the state is offering pre-storm value			0
' i know a lot of people in my neighborhood do n't want to stay , and if they were offered a buyout they 'd take it , ' said @entity303 , who is staying at his parents ' house with his wife and 1 - year - old daughter			2
' we just want to get on with our lives			0
it 's a hundred - something days after the storm , and we 're still stuck in limbo			0

discounts of up to 60 per cent off are being offered on some properties damaged or leveled by @entity8
data indicates that most homeowners are either rebuilding , or are unsure of what to do about their houses
