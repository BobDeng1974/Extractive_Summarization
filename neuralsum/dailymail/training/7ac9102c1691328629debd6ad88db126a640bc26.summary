by @entity1 reporter published : 23:50 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 13:33 est , 20 november 2012 the @entity2 will decide this week whether to approve a law to allow women bishops			2
the @entity5 will hold a series of votes tomorrow , billed as the most significant decision it has taken since it backed women priests 20 years ago			1
the legislation needs a two - thirds majority in all three houses of the @entity5 – of bishops , clergy and laity – to win final approval			1
decision time : the @entity2 will decide this week whether to approve a law to allow women bishops			2
both the outgoing archbishop of @entity22 , dr @entity23 , left and his replacement , the @entity26 @entity25 , right , are in favour of the legislation a defeat would be seen as a serious blow to dr @entity23 , the outgoing archbishop of @entity22 , who has been campaigning for a yes vote			1
the incoming archbishop , the @entity26 @entity25 , has also urged the @entity5 to vote for the legislation , saying that he is ‘ deeply committed ’ to the cause			1
a final vote on approval for the legislation was postponed in july , with bishops asked to reconsider a last - minute amendment which has now been rewritten			1
the debate this week is likely to centre on whether it is now acceptable to traditionalists			0
commentators have said they believe it will clear the houses of bishops and clergy with the necessary majority but the vote among lay members of the @entity5 is thought to be on a ' knife - edge '			1
more than 1,000 members of the @entity2 clergy and senior laity have signed an open letter to @entity54 urging the @entity5 to vote in favour of women bishops in the ballot			1
changes : if the legislation clears the final hurdle it will then go for approval in the houses of @entity63 , pictured , before receiving @entity64 , paving the way for the first women bishops in 2014 if the legislation clears the final hurdle it will then go for approval in the @entity62 before receiving @entity64 , paving the way for the first women bishops in 2014			1
a code of practice would also have to be drawn up outlining the arrangements to be made for traditionalists who do not accept the authority of a female bishop			0
if the legislation fails to clear the final hurdle it would take at least another five years before legislation on women bishops could be considered for final approval before the @entity5			1
the first women priests were ordained in 1994 and the @entity2 gave its backing to the principle of women bishops in 2005 and 2006			0
the legislation has received the backing of 42 out of the 44 @entity2 dioceses			2
but the @entity2 has struggled to reach a compromise between those campaigning in favour of women bishops and traditionalists threatening a walk - out over the issue			1
a final vote on approval for the legislation was postponed in july , with the @entity2 bishops asked to reconsider a last - minute amendment amid protests from pro-women campaigners			1
the amendment has been rewritten - and the debate is likely to centre on whether this is now acceptable to traditionalists			2
@entity102 , a vicar in @entity104 , and chairman of @entity106 , the conservative evangelical grouping , and the @entity108 , chairman of the @entity109 in the @entity5 , have called for members to vote against giving the legislation final approval			1
mr @entity102 said : ' we are urging @entity5 members to vote against the draft measure , not to abstain , we are doing so on the grounds that the provision it makes for people like us is completely inadequate for the longer term			1
disagreement : the @entity2 has struggled to reach a compromise between those campaigning in favour of women bishops and traditionalists threatening a walk - out over the issue			2
@entity126 is pictured ' we know that it is on a knife - edge - we think that , depending on which way the debate goes on the day , there could be enough people to stop the measure going through			0
' @entity134 , spokesman for the @entity109 in the @entity5 , which has around 80 members , said he believed the electronic voting system this time - compared with the use of the lobbies in 1992 - could make a difference			1
' the difference here from what happened in the 1990s is that there is electronic voting so you will not be being swayed to jump through lobbies			0
from what people have told me , people were persuaded to go through particular doors , ' he said			0
' the voting this time will be done on your own , with your own personal machine			0
it will not be until a fortnight afterwards that you will be able to see who has done what when the lists are published			0
' the @entity160 , chairman of the campaigning group @entity161 ) , said they were urging people to vote for the measure			2
' we know that it is close and that some people will make up their minds finally on the day , listening to the arguments and going with the sense of what is right , so nobody knows really with any accuracy what is going to happen			0
' we really hope that this goes through after all this time			0
' nobody is saying this is a perfect measure , we are not saying " how fantastic , we have got everything we wanted " , we are not saying that at all , because it is not true			0
' but we have been debating this whole question for 12 years and we really do need to make a decision			2
' she added : ' some , from both sides , want to wait in the hope of getting something better , but to do so would be incredibly destructive			0
' another 10 years going over and over the same arguments would cripple the @entity2 ’s credibility and mission			0
it would also deprive the church of the skills and wisdom of women bishops			0
to waste our time and talents in this way would be quite wrong			0

the @entity5 will hold a series of votes tomorrow - billed as the most significant decision it has taken in 20 years
the legislation needs a two - thirds majority in all three houses of the @entity5 to win final approval
a defeat would be a serious blow to dr @entity23 - the outgoing archbishop of @entity22 - who has been campaigning for a ' yes ' vote
