@entity0 hit a supreme 74 as the departing @entity2 captain led his country to @entity5 glory against @entity6 with a seven - wicket victory in @entity8 on sunday			1
a crowd of 93,013 witnessed @entity10 claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one - sided			2
@entity6 were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below - par 183 in 45 overs , despite 83 from @entity16 – as @entity17 bowled @entity18 for a duck in the first over			1
@entity18 called right at the toss and on a sun - bathed @entity26 the @entity6 captain understandably chose to bat			1
so often the 33 - year - old ’s own innings sets the tempo of the @entity6 innings and on sunday it was no different			1
having come out swinging and twice been beaten , @entity18 was bowled for a duck by a full , in - swinging @entity17 delivery that cannoned into off - stump			1
it sent the @entity26 crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a @entity5 final for the first time ever			0
aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen @entity6 boast an average run - rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but @entity10 ’s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one			1
@entity0 ’s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive @entity80 bowled @entity81 ( 15 ) with just his second ball			1
and six balls later @entity6 were reduced to 39 for three as @entity84 departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive @entity85 but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler			1
it was the perfect start for @entity10 and @entity0 remained on the attack with two new @entity6 batsman at the crease			1
but @entity92 and semi-final hero @entity16 steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild , with the latter top - edging @entity17 for a 72 - meter six into the leg side			0
the pair shared a 111 - run fourth - wicket partnership and looked to have brought @entity6 back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse			2
@entity101 , who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers , was brought back into the attack and immediately had @entity92 caught behind for 40			0
the 24 - year - old @entity106 deceived the batsman with a slower ball and @entity109 took an exceptional low catch , diving to his right , with the ball dying on him			0
two balls later the heavy - hitting @entity114 was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps			0
a double - wicket maiden in a @entity5 is impressive , a double - wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match - winning moment			0
five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper @entity128 ’s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged @entity17 to @entity0 at first slip for a four - ball duck – the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run			0
meanwhile , @entity16 – fresh from his semi-final match - winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before			0
@entity10 captain @entity0 plays a shot as he helps his country to victory in the @entity5 final against @entity6 batsman @entity146 watches one of his shots as @entity10 close in on victory at @entity26 @entity17 ( left ) celebrates with his @entity10 team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity128 @entity6 's @entity152 ( right ) looks on as @entity146 ( centre ) sees a shot reach the boundary @entity10 's @entity34 attempts an acrobatic catch after a shot from @entity6 's @entity16 and , whereas @entity0 ’s one - day international swansong was going to plan @entity159 could only muster nine before a full in - swinging yorker from @entity85 hit the 36 - year - old ’s pad and rattled onto the stumps			1
@entity6 were crumbling and @entity16 having effortlessly moved to 83 became @entity101 ’s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by @entity109			0
when needed most , the @entity6 tail failed to wag and the final wicket run - out perfectly summed up both side ’s days up to that point			2
@entity152 defended a short @entity85 ball to @entity80 at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker ’s stumps			0
@entity178 ’s bat stuck in the ground and he was run - out , as @entity6 stumbled to 183 all out			0
it was telling that @entity10 leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line - up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field			0
early wickets were going to be vital if @entity6 were going to make their first @entity5 final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler , @entity190 , delivered			2
@entity6 's @entity81 walks off the field after being dismissed by @entity10 's @entity80 @entity17 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity18 during a disappointing day for @entity6 @entity34 helps @entity10 regain control after the early wicket of @entity195 in @entity8 @entity6 's @entity92 is left on the turf after dropping a potential catch following a shot from @entity146 @entity6 's @entity16 bats on his way to 83 - the highest score by any player during the @entity6 ' innings both @entity10 and @entity6 stand for the national anthems at a packed @entity26 on sunday @entity195 attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads , up into the air and into the waiting @entity152 ’s hands			1
the @entity212 fans , silent for large parts of the first innings , were now making themselves heard but @entity146 soon quieted them once again			2
@entity146 found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46 - balls before @entity216 claimed his first wicket of the @entity5 having batsman caught at deep square leg , attempting to pull the ball			1
the loss of the second @entity2 wicket put @entity18 back into an aggressive mindset and @entity0 was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30 - yard circle			1
but the right - handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked @entity178 for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from @entity216 , having made 74 off 72 - balls			2
and , @entity34 ( 56 not out ) hit his fifth consecutive half - century as the @entity26 erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun			0
it was a disappointing end for @entity6 who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the @entity5			2
but the day and night belonged to the @entity2 who once again were crowned as the best one - day team in the world .			0
