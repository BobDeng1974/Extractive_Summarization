two of our officers offered him some strong words of advice			0
' he surrendered the weapon which was an imitation firearm			0
it was a plastic model @entity21 which he had painted himself to make it more realistic			0
' what he has been told and what we would tell other people is that anybody who wants to do something out of the ordinary should think about it first			0
' obviously when you have dressed yourself like that you know what your motives are but clearly some people this morning were not and they rightly called the police			0
' we were relatively certain that it would be something around the fundraising issue but we could n't be sure so we responded with our armed unit , our dog unit and a helicopter			2
' there have been no sightings of the man since officers responded to a number of calls this morning ' this is the second similar high profile incident which has taken place in the last month			0
