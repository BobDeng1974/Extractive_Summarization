@entity0 silenced his critics with a passing masterclass - with more than 90 per cent accuracy - and a goal in the @entity6 derby			1
click here for his stats and all the players ' heat maps in our brilliant @entity11			0
for two proud captains , this was the @entity15			0
@entity0 and @entity16 have each been on the receiving end of unaccustomed criticism this season but neither @entity20 nor @entity21 could have done without them yesterday			1
@entity0 went first in a pulsating derby , pulling rank on @entity25 to take a 65th - minute free - kick and curl it exquisitely past @entity28 goalkeeper @entity27			1
overtaken by the emotion of it all , the 34 - year - old midfielder let out a joyous screech of pure adrenalin and cupped his hand to his ear — a response to the abuse @entity37 had given him all afternoon			2
it looked as if it would be the latest @entity0 classic winner until @entity16 improbably stepped forward in the second minute of injury time and hit a 25 - yard screamer that would still be travelling if the net had not stopped it			1
@entity28 celebrate the injury time equaliser from @entity16 ( right ) after his stunning half - volley clinched a draw in the @entity6 derby as the graphic demonstrates , @entity16 's stunning drive was clocked at 58mph as it flew off the defender 's boot and into the back of @entity55 's net @entity0 celebrates giving his side the lead from a free - kick in the 65th minute at @entity59 @entity60 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : mignolet 5.5 ; @entity61 7 , @entity62 7.5 , @entity63 7 , @entity64 7.5 ; @entity0 8 , @entity65 8.5 ; @entity66 8 , @entity67 7.5 , @entity68 5 ( @entity69 60 ) ; @entity25 6 ( @entity70 88 ) subs not used : @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity70 , @entity69 , @entity76 , @entity77 manager : @entity20 7.5 goal : @entity0 64 booked : @entity0 , @entity64 @entity28 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity27 5.5 ; hibbert 5.5 ( @entity80 ' 73 ) , @entity81 7 , @entity16 8 , @entity82 6.5 ; @entity83 7 , @entity84 5.5 , @entity85 7 ( @entity86 ' 80 ) ; @entity87 5 , @entity88 6 , @entity89 6 ( @entity90 ' 31 ) subs not used : @entity92 ( gk ) , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 manager : @entity21 6.5 goal : @entity16 90 +1 booked : @entity84 referee : @entity99 attendance : 44,511 ‘ i have never seen a better strike live , ’ said @entity28 boss @entity21			1
‘ it was incredible , though it probably it helps it was in the last minute , at @entity59 and for my team			2
’ there was something poignant about both players hauling their team - mates up by their bootstraps for the biggest game of the season for supporters			0
@entity0 has suffered a slow start to the season and found it difficult to recover from the twin blows of making a mistake that cost @entity60 the @entity119 title last season and then captaining @entity121 to their @entity123 failure in @entity124			2
no wonder he enjoyed his brilliant set - piece goal			0
‘ i ’ll agree with the constructive criticism and i ’ve been stifled in a couple of games when people have followed me around and i have n’t been able to shake them off , ’ he said			0
‘ but then people take it too far and say that “ he ’s 34 and he ca n’t run and he ’s finished ”			0
i can still compete with the best players around			0
’ after seeing @entity25 miss with a series of free - kicks in the first half , he had no hesitation in grabbing the ball when the @entity141 had been fouled by @entity82			1
‘ you get a feeling for free - kicks in certain areas of the pitch and i fancied it , ’ he said			2
@entity20 was a bit more forthright			0
‘ i was screaming for @entity0 to take it because i know his quality in those situations			2
but he is so selfless he sometimes wants others to have an opportunity			0
’ the @entity60 boss was adamant that @entity0 ’s goal should have been the winner and in terms of possession and chances he was unquestionably right			2
@entity28 could have seen @entity84 sent off early for a series of indiscretions , starting with a first - minute foul on @entity67 and were relieved when @entity25 hit the crossbar from four yards out following @entity66 ’s cross			1
but the visitors showed tremendous character to pour bodies forward in the closing stages			0
just after the stadium announcer told 45,000 fans there would be three minutes of added time , @entity90 whipped a cross into a crowded penalty area			1
@entity63 got good distance with his clearing header but @entity16 returned it with interest with a strike that hit @entity60 goalkeeper @entity55 ’s top - left hand corner like a bullet			1
@entity60 's @entity67 ( left ) goes down after a strong , late , challenge from @entity28 's @entity84 early on in the @entity6 derby @entity87 is brought down in the penalty area by @entity60 's @entity64 leading to frenzied appeals from @entity28 to referee @entity186 for a penalty striker @entity87 falls after the challenge from @entity64 but @entity186 waves away calls for a spot kick from the visitors @entity64 ( centre ) and @entity65 ( right ) plead with @entity186 for a penatly after the ball appeared to strike @entity84 on the arm the evidence is n't in favour of the @entity28 midfielder after he raises his left and it blocks the powerful shot from @entity66 @entity202 miles @entity60 108.9 67.7 @entity67 90 12.4 7.7 @entity65 90 11.3 7.0 @entity0 90 10.9 6.7 @entity28 109.1 67.8 @entity84 90 11.5 7.1 @entity88 90 11.3 7.0 @entity83 90 10.7 6.7 it was the 32 - year - old defender ’s seventh @entity119 goal in seven years at @entity28 and , like @entity0 ’s , followed plenty of recent criticism for his displays at the @entity123 and his club shipping goals			1
@entity21 said : ‘ there has been talk of a @entity123 hangover and i think that has been really unfair			0
he has set high standards and cares like nobody else			0
‘ it would have been easy for him as a centre - half to stay in his position while we ’re chasing the game			2
but he came forward because of his belief and sense of responsibility he has			0
he showed the way to face adversity			0
nobody deserved to score more than him			0
’ given the form of both teams going into the 223rd @entity6 derby , a goal glut was widely predicted			1
@entity28 had conceded 17 goals in seven games and @entity60 had been beaten in three of their five @entity119 outings			2
the opening was as ferocious as in any previous derby			0
@entity84 was booked for his early go at @entity67 and could have been sent off either for handling @entity66 ’s shot inside the area or clipping @entity25 , both inside the first 11 minutes			1
neither was given by referee @entity186 , who also waved away @entity28 appeals for a penalty when @entity64 shoved @entity87			1
@entity28 were lucky to reach half - time on terms , with @entity27 making excellent stops to deny @entity25 and @entity67			1
@entity89 is clearly in pain as he clutches his hamstring before being forced to leave the pitch in the first half against @entity60 @entity87 ( left ) and substitute @entity86 ( right ) show their concern for as @entity89 as he goes down over the sideline with a leg injury @entity60 captain @entity0 ( left ) tries to keep tabs on @entity28 's @entity88 @entity87 's arms are splayed as he attempts to evade a sliding challenge from @entity60 's @entity61 @entity28 keeper @entity27 makes himself big as @entity25 makes an attempt on goal @entity16 was involved three times in the lead - up to his blistering equaliser for @entity28 ... for more go to our brilliant @entity11 the move that ended with @entity16 's cracking goal started with the @entity121 defender before he pounced on @entity63 's inadequate clearance from the box they also had to regroup when @entity89 strained his hamstring and had to be replaced by @entity90			1
@entity25 was targeted in the second half , with @entity269 eyeballed by the @entity141 after a scissor - kick challenge to win the ball			1
but the @entity141 ’s penchant for over-dramatising any challenge did not earn him any sympathy from the referee			0
@entity141 striker @entity25 strikes a free - kick sweetly but does n't manage to find the back of the net for @entity60 the flight of the ball after @entity25 's free - kick from just outside the penalty area as the @entity28 wall jumps @entity284 as ever , @entity66 ( right ) takes an ambitious shot with his left foot under attention from @entity269 ( centre ) @entity87 gets one back on @entity64 with an outstretched leg after their first half clash in the penalty area @entity292 defender @entity64 is upended in the challenge from @entity87 however , it was @entity25 who won the all - important free - kick for the goal when he was brought down after ghosting past @entity82			1
@entity0 , sent off the last time @entity28 won at @entity59 in 1999 , did the rest with precision			1
despite his disappointment at not winning , @entity20 was pleased with his side ’s improvement after what he called a ‘ broken ’ start to the season			0
‘ we were clearly the better side and did n’t get what we deserved , ’ he said			0
@entity28 still have not won on enemy territory this century			2
but after their late escape , they will not care — for this weekend at least			0
@entity0 shapes to strike the free - kick that gave @entity60 a 1 - 0 lead in the @entity6 derby @entity0 hits his free - kick perfectly as it beats the jumping @entity28 wall @entity0 laps up the adulation as @entity59 urupts after his free - kick put @entity60 ahead @entity60 players rush to smother their captain @entity0 after his goal @entity0 gestures seemingly in response to recent criticism of his form being below its usual lofty standard @entity0 slides into the corner as he celebrates yet another goal at @entity59 @entity25 almost makes it 2 - 0 as he blasts a volley from a stellar @entity66 cross beyond @entity28 keeper @entity27 but it clatters into the crossbar @entity25 fails to keep his volley down after @entity66 put a second goal for @entity60 on a platter for him with an excellent run down the left side @entity16 drains the equaliser with a sensational half - volley in the 90th minute unlikely hero @entity16 reacts after his blistering right - footed drive catches the underside of the crossbar and nestles in the back of the net @entity16 ( centre ) leads the celebrations after his strike saved a draw for @entity28 @entity60 and @entity28 managers , @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 ( right ) share a light - hearted moment before the @entity6 derby on saturday			1

@entity0 scored the opener from a powerful 65th - minute free - kick in the @entity6 derby at @entity59
@entity16 's stunning half - volley after 90 minutes from outside the box in injury time saved a draw for @entity28
@entity89 went off after half an hour as @entity28 's @entity360 midfielder picked up a hamstring injury
@entity28 had a big shout for a penalty when @entity64 brought down @entity87 in the penalty area
@entity60 claimed @entity84 handled in the area but that too was waved away by referee @entity186
@entity84 was lucky to not receive a second *yellow* card after a loose tackle on @entity67 early in the match
