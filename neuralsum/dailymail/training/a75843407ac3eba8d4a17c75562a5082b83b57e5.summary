' the defendant also won a golf tournament , having played three consecutive day of golf			2
' @entity7 , who is married , was interviewed by investigators and said he had been told to play golf by his doctor after a knee replacement operation failed			1

he said he could only walk any distance or play golf after taking strong painkillers			2
he said : ' there 's a lot more to this than was said in court			0
' i 've had a back problem since a girder fell on me in a pit in 1985 and my knee was damaged playing football when i was younger			0

recorder davies , who had remanded him in the court cells for an hour over lunch , told him : ' offences like this are particularly serious at a time when there is an effort to reduce the expenses on the public purse and reduce benefits being paid where they should not be paid			2
' when people are suffering a reduction in living standards and income , it 's particularly galling for honest people to see someone like you overpaid by such an enormous sum of money			0
' you could n't complain if i sent you immediately to prison today but there is force in the mitigation that you did n't do this dishonestly from the outset and it 's right to reflect in the sentence that you do genuinely have very significant disabilities and have had medical problems for many years			0
' @entity15 will now face a proceeds of crime hearing as the @entity19 tries to claw back the money			0
