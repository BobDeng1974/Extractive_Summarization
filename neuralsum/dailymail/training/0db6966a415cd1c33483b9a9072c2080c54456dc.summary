criminal activity has often been associated with $ 100 bills - and the type of people that carry them			1
but a study has revealed that the consumer most likely to carry them is a person who is aged over 55 and has been educated past that of high school			1
the research , carried out by @entity11 and @entity12 of the @entity13 , states that on a typical day in the @entity15 one in twenty people carry $ 100 bills			1
criminal activity has often been associated with $ 100 bills - and the type of people that carry them			1
but a study has revealed that the consumer most likely to carry them is a person who is aged over 55 and has been educated past that of high school it is often assumed that they are used by criminals or tax evaders as cash is difficult to track and $ 100 bills is the easiest way to transport large amounts of cash , for this reason @entity31 , an economist at @entity32 , wants the bills to be taken out of circulation , and told @entity35 in august : ' think about countries like @entity37 , @entity38 , where they 're really at war with the drug money , where the @entity15 is not only buying the drugs but it 's providing this resource that very much helps the drug dealers			1
' but the study suggests that 5.2 percent of consumers admit to carrying one or more $ 100 bills and the researchers found no evidence these people were anything but law abiding , reports @entity53 who analyzed the findings			2
there does not appear to be evidence that consumers try to get rid of $ 100 bills either - the study states : ' on any given day , between 75 percent and 80 percent of respondents to the 2012 @entity62 who carried a $ 100 bill held on to it			2
' there does not appear to be evidence that consumers try to get rid of $ 100 bills			0
' the study also does not support the idea that people who are rich only use credit cards or debit cards to pay for goods - it found that those who carry around lots of cash actually earn more money			0
a graph to show which bills consumers are most likely to carry - $ 20 came out top the paper states that consumers who make more than $ 75,000 are about 50 percent more likely to be carrying around $ 100 than those who make less than $ 35,000			0
but the study does point out that the reason for carrying a $ 100 bill could be for ease - ' consumers who carry a lot of cash find them easier to carry than a fat wad of 20s , 10s , or lower denominations			0
' cash is still used for 40 percent of all purchases - in general the amount of cash in circulation keeps rising with $ 1.2 trillion in cash outside banks , up 20 percent since 2011			0
although the use of credit and debit cards is rising , these is in replacement of checks going out of use .			0
