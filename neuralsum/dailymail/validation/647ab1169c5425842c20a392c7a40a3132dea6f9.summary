' it 's destroyed my life as it was and the whole violent affair has changed me hugely			0
' he said the incident had placed a great strain on his relationship with ms @entity18 and that the couple have since split			0
one of the officers admitted punched mr @entity14 in the face and kneeing him nine times during the incident mr @entity14 called for the officers responsible to be removed from the force , adding : ' the police are not judges or punishers , that 's what the courts do and the police ca n't go around acting like this			1
' @entity39 have already responded to the latest report - which will now be considered by the @entity37 before a final decision is made			0
the couple had been making their way home from a folk festival in @entity12 when mr @entity14 was stopped by officers on @entity103 responding to reports of a man being drunk and disorderly in a nearby pub. he was arrested after assaulting police officers as they tried to place him in a police car			1

in a police statement seen by reporters @entity126 also admitted to punching mr @entity14 in the face			1
he said : ' ... to distract him from his attempts to bite and resist i have punched @entity14 with my right fist clenched , in the left side of his face			2
' i used nine knee strikes during the struggle , which lasted a considerable amount of time			0
' when the matter was first reported in december 2013 , @entity39 said the tactics were approved and necessary as mr @entity14 was resisting arrest			1
however , the @entity37 report said : ' from the @entity1 footage it does appear that mr @entity14 is at stages non-compliant with the police			1

' also , @entity151 states that he delivered punches to mr @entity153 to stop him from scratching him , however , @entity150 appears to have moved his leg out of the reach of mr @entity14 when he delivers the strikes			1
