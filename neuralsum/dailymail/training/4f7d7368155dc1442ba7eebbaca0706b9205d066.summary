thousands of airline passengers could face further delays today after a major air traffic control glitch caused disruption at airports across the @entity5 and @entity6			1
hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed yesterday after problems with a telephone system at the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) centre in @entity12 , @entity13			1
up to 100,000 passengers faced delays and cancellation at the major airports of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 , after an air traffic control glitch led to the worst airport chaos since the 2010 ash cloud crisis			1
travel hell : passengers queue at the flight check - in desk to re-book tickets at @entity28 after a ' technical problem ' at the @entity10 control centre caused long delays distressed : one man looked glum and another was holding his head in his hands at @entity19 in @entity35 taking a nap : a woman sleeps at @entity20 as @entity5 's airports experienced delays and cancellations not moving : @entity42 - up passengers are seen waiting and queuing at @entity28 on saturday @entity44 beards : @entity45 posted this photograph on @entity47 , saying she and her friends were stranded at @entity19 with a three - hour delay , hoping to make it to @entity51 to celebrate a 30th birthday passengers queuing for the @entity55 ticket desk at @entity19 in @entity35 officials said there were more than 250 flight cancellations , with a further 1,000 flights delayed by a broken internal telephone system in a single air traffic control base			1
air traffic control chiefs announced at 7.30pm on saturday that they had finally solved the glitch , 14 hours after the problems began			2
earlier they had missed a self - imposed 6.30pm target for fixing the issue			0
@entity69 air traffic controllers at @entity70 said that in all 1,300 flights across @entity5 and @entity6 were delayed by the chaos			1
while the disruption is likely to have a knock - on effect today , the three main @entity28 airports predicted a largely trouble - free day			0
a spokesman for @entity18 said last night : ' there are no planned flight schedule changes for sunday			2
we still advise passengers to check with airlines prior to travelling though			0
' @entity20 said that operations had returned to normal and it was ' not anticipating significant disruptions ' today , while @entity19 forecast a normal flight schedule but advised passengers to check the status of flights with airlines			1
a screen displays delayed flights at @entity20 estimates : a flight information board at @entity19 after a ' technical problem ' caused delays at airports bored : a woman looks fed - up in @entity98 at @entity18 ( left ) while another sleeps at @entity20 ( right ) up above : this map from @entity101 shows the real - time position of all planes over the @entity28 region just after 8.30am today			1
aircraft can be seen grouped over @entity19 ( top centre ) and @entity20 ( bottom centre ) unhappy : plane passengers took to @entity47 to express their dismay at the delays across @entity5 this morning the problem occurred when the 23 controllers on a night shift at @entity12 handed over to the 125 controllers on the day shift at about 6am			1
@entity10 ' night - time operating system , which combines sectors of airspace for when it is less busy , did not properly switch over to the daytime system , causing a communication problem with the centre 's internal telephones			0
they stressed that safety was not at risk at any time			0
waiting game : passengers queue at the flight check - in desk at @entity129 standing in line : a spokesman for @entity132 said the airline is trying to ' minimise disruption to our flights ' problems : @entity18 had cancelled 60 flights by 9.45am , with that figure split roughly equally between departures and arrivals waiting around : passengers queue outside @entity98 at @entity28 as thousands were delayed delays galore : a flight information board at @entity146 , as a ' technical problem ' at the @entity10 control centre in @entity12 , @entity13 , caused delays at airports across @entity5 delays : passengers at @entity20 ( file picture ) were warned they could be waiting for ' a couple of hours ' grounded : @entity19 ( file picture ) said all of its departing flights were subject to delays of between 30 minutes and two hours @entity18 was the worst affected , with 228 cancellations - 112 in arrivals , and 116 departures , with most being short - haul flights			1
a spokesman for the airport said the cancellations represented 15 % of their usual daily total of 1,300 flights going in and out of the airport			1
she added : ' today we have 18 cancellations - 11 arrivals and seven departures - and that 's mostly due to crew displacement			2
' apart from that we are pretty much running as normal			0
' frustrated passengers were left in long queues to rebook flights , while others reported having to wait for hours to speak to airline representatives			2
@entity181 , @entity182 , @entity184 @entity183 , @entity185 , @entity146 , @entity186 and @entity51 were also all affected			1
the glitch affected flights across @entity69 , with 1,300 flights , nearly 8 per cent of all traffic in @entity69 , ' severely delayed ' , according to @entity70 , the @entity69 organisation for air navigation safety			1
a spokesman for @entity10 said last night : ' as of 7.30pm we had handled 3,250 flights today - around 90 per cent of the traffic handled last saturday ( 3,613 flights )			0
' in a statement yesterday , @entity10 apologised for the disruption , saying : ' the reduction in capacity has had a disproportionate effect on southern @entity202 because it is extremely complex and busy airspace and we sincerely regret inconvenience to our airline customers and their passengers			0
' to be clear , this is a very complex and sophisticated system with more than a million lines of software			0
this is not simply internal telephones , it is the system that controllers use to speak to other @entity216 agencies both in the @entity5 and @entity69 and is the biggest system of its kind in @entity69			0
' this has been a major challenge for our engineering team and for the manufacturer , who has worked closely with us to ensure this complex problem was resolved as quickly as possible while maintaining a safe service			0
' looking down : there have been cancellations at @entity18 for flights scheduled to leave			2
a file pictured of the view for two air traffic controllers from the control tower at @entity18 is seen problems : a spokesman for @entity28 ( file picture ) said it was ' currently experiencing some delays ' the £ 623 million @entity10 ( @entity10 ) centre yesterday experienced a failure of ‘ a very complex and sophisticated system ’			1
during the night , when there are fewer flights , a single air traffic controller can handle more than one sector of airspace , but as the day begins , with a corresponding upsurge in the number of planes in the air , the system is designed to split air space into several smaller sectors , each handled by a separate controller			0
issue : a computing glitch in the early hours of the morning at the @entity10 control centre ( pictured ) in @entity12 , @entity13 , meant the night - time operation failed to properly switch over to the daytime system yesterday that split did not happen and the system remained in ‘ sleep ’ mode			1
that left air traffic controllers unable to open up the skies to the usual daytime volume of flights , so initially , departing flights were grounded to allow incoming airliners on long - haul journeys to land			0
operations at @entity10 at @entity12 , in @entity13 , have been affected by computer glitches before , but yesterday ’s problem was unconnected to any previous malfunctions			2
as @entity10 staff worked to overcome the difficulty , bosses were looking to see if recent changes or routine maintenance could have been to blame			0
part - privatised in 2001 , @entity10 had a series of software problems as it prepared to move operations to @entity13 from its old hq at @entity286 in @entity28 .			2
