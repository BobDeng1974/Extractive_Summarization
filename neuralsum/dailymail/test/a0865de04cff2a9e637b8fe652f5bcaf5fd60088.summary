from deep craters to basaltic plains , the varied surface of the moon has been revealed in stunning detail by the @entity5			1
the two sets of maps , compiled by cartographer @entity8 , include image mosaics and topographical views of the lunar landscape taken over a period of four years			1
the grey and white areas reveal higher peaks , while darker blues show deep craters			2
to the left of these craters , is @entity20 , which is @entity21 for ' @entity20 '			1
the two sets of maps include image mosaics ( right ) and topographical views ( right ) of the lunar landscape			1
darker blue show deep craters , while the grey and white areas reveal areas of elevation early theories claimed this mysterious region , roughly 1,600 miles ( 2,600km ) across , was created by an asteroid impact			2
last year , however , @entity35 scientists proposed that the @entity20 was in fact the result of the formation of ancient rift valleys			1
the feature is located on the surface of the moon 's near side which is characterised by low elevations and numerous ancient volcanic plains			2
scientists believe the rifts are buried beneath dark volcanic plains in this area , and so far , they have only been detected in the gravity data provided by the grail probes			0
the map also shows @entity52 , an impact crater that was partially flooded by basalts			1
shaped like a target ring bull 's - eye , the @entity52 is one of the most striking large scale lunar features			1
found on the moon 's extreme western edge , it is difficult to see from an earthbound perspective pictured on the left is the moon 's south pole , and on the right , the north pole			2
to create the maps , more than 6.5 billion measurements were collected between 2009 and 2013 by the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) and the @entity71 @entity35 's ultimate goal at the moment is to land humans on @entity75 by the 2030s			1
exactly how to get there is up for debate , with the agency favouring a mission to an asteroid in the next decade , followed by a giant leap to the red planet the decade after			0
but one expert has claimed that @entity35 is actually planning to go back to the moon first , as a waypoint to reaching its final goal			2
writing for @entity89 , science reporter @entity88 explained how president @entity90 had , in 2010 , outlined @entity35 's goals for the forthcoming decades			0
' i just have to say pretty bluntly here , we 've been there before , ' the president said in a speech at the @entity97 in @entity98 at the time			0
the goal instead was to visit an asteroid in the 2020s , and then send a crew to @entity75 in the 2030s - with no mission to another destination in between			0
recently , @entity35 revealed how they plan to do the asteroid mission - by picking up a boulder from a larger asteroid , placing it in lunar orbit , and having astronauts go and visit			0
but mr @entity88 says that @entity35 has been ' quietly ' considering going back to the moon before going to @entity75			0
he said that @entity35 is , ' in internal studies , reconsidering the moon , including the lunar surface , for human activities as a significant stepping stone to @entity75			0
' the lava - flooded rift valleys are unlike anything found anywhere else on the moon and may at one time have resembled rift zones on @entity125 , @entity75 and @entity126			0
the map also shows @entity52 , an impact crater that was partially flooded by basalts			1
shaped like a target ring bull 's - eye , the @entity52 is one of the most striking large scale lunar features			1
found on the moon 's extreme western edge , it is difficult to see from an earthbound perspective			0
it is about 600 miles ( 950km ) across and was formed by the impact of an asteroid sized object which caused ripples in the lunar crust resulting in the concentric circular features			0
to create the maps , mr @entity8 used more than 6.5 billion measurements collected between 2009 and 2013 by the @entity69 ( @entity70 ) and the @entity71 ( @entity71 )			1
the images have also been released in black - and - white image mosaic based on the same data using wide angle cameras			0

the maps , compiled by @entity5 , include image mosaics and topographical views of the moon
they show features such as ' @entity20 ' and @entity52 captured by @entity71
to create the maps , *researchers* used more than 6.5 billion measurements collected between 2009 and 2013
