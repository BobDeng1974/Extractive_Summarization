polls yesterday suggested the election will be too close to call – with the @entity2 narrowly ahead in two , while another showed @entity4 edging in front			0
the news came as an @entity8 pollster – who predicted the results of the 2008 @entity8 presidential election almost exactly – concluded that both main parties will struggle to cobble together any kind of workable majority			1
the latest @entity16 poll for the @entity17 had the @entity2 ahead on 34 per cent – down five points from a week ago			0
@entity4 were down one point on 32 per cent			0
@entity20 , who correctly predicted the winner in 49 of 50 @entity8 states in 2008 , believes that neither @entity4 or the @entity2 will be unable to get enough support together for a majority government meanwhile a new @entity26 poll found @entity4 unchanged on 34 per cent , while the @entity2 were down one , on 32 per cent			1
in a third poll , lord @entity28 found a @entity31 lead of four points – with the party on 34 per cent compared to @entity4 's 30 per cent			0
pollster @entity20 , who correctly called the winner in 49 of 50 @entity8 states in 2008 , yesterday predicted a hung parliament after may 7 with the @entity2 winning 283 seats and @entity4 274			1
this means that both @entity38 and @entity39 could find it almost impossible to secure enough support from other parties for a working majority – let alone rule on their own			1
@entity44 said mr @entity39 is now more likely than mr @entity38 to be prime minister after the election mr @entity20 said @entity4 , who have ruled out a formal coalition with the @entity49 , would also be short of a majority even with the help of the @entity52 , whom he expects to gain 42 seats mr @entity20 said that even if the @entity2 join forces with the @entity57 – who he believes will win 27 seats – they would still be 13 short of the 323 mps needed for a majority			1
with @entity62 expected to have only one mp in the projection , @entity61 would not be able to offer much help – and even with the support of eight @entity68 mps from @entity69 , mr @entity38 could not achieve a majority			0
mr @entity20 said @entity4 , which has ruled out a formal coalition with the @entity49 , would also be short of a majority even with the help of the @entity52 , who he predicted will gain 42 seats			2
that would give mr @entity39 316 seats – seven short of a majority			2
he would then have to try to gain support from smaller parties such as @entity79 , the @entity80 and @entity69 's @entity81 – but as they are projected to win only six seats between them , @entity4 would still be one short of the necessary 323 .			0

@entity20 predicts the @entity31 will win 283 seats and *labour* 274
means both @entity38 or @entity39 could find it all but impossible to cobble together a workable coalition – let alone rule on their own
*respected* @entity8 pollster predicted results of 2008 @entity8 election almost exactly
