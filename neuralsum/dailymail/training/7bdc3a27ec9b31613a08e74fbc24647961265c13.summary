when @entity1 , 46 , went to the dentist to have her crowns replaced , she certainly did n't expect to be left with no upper teeth at all			1
but that is exactly what happened and six years later , ms @entity1 says she is still too embarrassed to leave the house			1
' i had never been embarrassed about how my teeth are , ' says the learning support assistant from @entity11			1
' so afraid of the dentist is ms @entity1 now , she was too frightened to get help when she began experiencing problems with her bottom teeth - and now has just five left in total			1
her ordeal began six years ago when a routine procedure was badly bungled			2
' when i came round back at home in my bed , i was horrified , ' she says , wiping away a tear			2
' i thought i was going to wake up with my teeth crowned or at least my teeth filed down ready to have the crowns fitted the next week but instead , she 'd just removed my teeth			1
' the dentist had given her a dental plate but ms @entity1 says she was n't told how to use the device and says wearing it is ' alien ' to her			1
now ms @entity1 is so self - conscious about her unsightly teeth , she is afraid to leave the house - a problem made worse by cruel bullies who insult her looks in the street			1
' i 'm on borrowed time , borrowed time , ' she says			2
' i have five teeth left and it t has really affected my life			1
' i do n't go out			2
i 'm just happier staying at home			2
the one time i stop thinking about my appearance and what i look like is when i 'm in my garden , gardening			1
' i just enjoy it because i do n't have to interact with anyone			2
i do n't have to put my hand in front of my mouth when i 'm talking to my plants			0
' i have n't really got any quality of life to speak of			0
i 'm happier at home than i am going out because i have n't got to face people			0
' her son @entity71 is horrified by the change in his formerly bubbly mother			0
' the last time i went out with my mum was on my 16th birthday , ' he says			0
' it 's been a long time			0
' i 'm not going to live with my mum forever , ' he continues			0
' i 'd love to see her happy			1
' ' i 've basically been told that i 'm a mess , ' adds ms @entity1			1
' i 've been told that i 'm an embarrassment			0
' once someone says that to you , where do you go from there ? there 's nowhere else to go			0
' although her son would like her to meet a new man and be happy , ms @entity1 says her hopes were dashed by the botched procedure			1
' i 'm single and i ca n't imagine meeting anyone or being with anyone like that , ' she says			0
' who 'd want to be with someone like me ? i have n't got a life			0
i exist but i do n't live			0
' big improvement : ms @entity1 has now had all her teeth replaced with implants - and is much happier but there is light at the end of the tunnel for ms @entity1 , after she was offered a reconstruction operation by @entity105 surgeon , dr @entity104			1
dr @entity104 , who specialises in tooth implants , was forced to remove her remaining teeth and remove rotten stumps from her upper gums but , after eight hours in surgery , successfully completed the operation			1
a delighted ms @entity1 says the surgery has been life - changing			1
' it 's unbelievable , ' she beams			0
' it 's just nice to go out and hold my head up and smile and not look down when people look at me			2
' it was kill or cure for me			0
i 'm so much happier now that at the end of the day , my cheeks hurt from smiling so much			0
' @entity71 is similarly pleased			0
' since the surgery , my mum has been happy in herself , ' he says , adding cheekily : ' she now spends a lot of time looking in the mirror smiling at herself			2
' ' there 's nothing to stop me doing anything now , ' adds ms @entity1			1
' having the surgery has just changed my life			0

@entity1 , 46 , thought she was having new crowns fitted
afterwards , she discovered the dentist had removed all her upper teeth
the botched operation has left her a recluse and afraid to smile
she says the only place she feels happy is alone in the garden
