by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:39 est , 17 february 2014 @entity3 : 01:55 est , 17 february 2014 crews are preparing to investigate a mystery radiation leak 2,000 feet underground in a facility where waste from the country 's nuclear weapons program is kept in sealed containers officials are at a loss to explain what has caused the excessive leak at the @entity15 in @entity16 which is designed to store waste underground for centuries			1
operations at the desert facility were shut down following an incident earlier this month when a truck caught fire underground and several workers suffered smoke inhalation			2
mystery below : the @entity26 near @entity27 was placed on shutdown after an underground alarm was triggered from a possible radioactive leak deep below : radioactive waste is buried in the salt formations in special casks sealed : the salt is supposed to keep the waste from penetrating water supplies connected ? work at the facility stopped last week after a truck caught fire underground and several employees suffered smoke inhalation massive : @entity26 is the third deepest geological storage site in the world , behind two facilities in @entity47 search postponed : investigators have n't been able to go underground yet to find the source of the leak timeline : the facility is expected to continue accepting waste until 2030 the @entity55 was opened in 1999 to store transuranic radioactive waste for 10,000 years			1
it is the third deepest geological storage center int he word after two different repositories in @entity47			0
the facility receives waste contaminated with plutonium , uranium , americium and neptunium			2
transuranic waste are materials that come in contact with radiation such as gloves , tools , rags and machinery			0
while they may not be as potent as nuclear reactor byproducts , transuranic waste can continue to contaminate for up to 24,000 years			0
since it opened in 1999 , @entity26 has processed 400,000 55 - gallon drums containing these radioactive materials and functioned without incident until friday			1
these cask drums are stored in rooms constructed into the salt basin 2,150 feet below ground			0
the rooms will help seal the materials from posing a risk to public health since it takes a billion years for water to move even an inch in the salty basin			0
@entity91 investigators still do n't know whether that incident played a role in this new leak , since they have n't been cleared to go underground to find the source			2
' they will not go in today			0
it 's a safety thing more than anything			0
we 're waiting until we get other assessments done before we authorize re-entry , ' @entity91 spokesman @entity99 said			0
an air monitor which detects airborne radiation went off around 11pm friday			1
while it was n't the first time alarms have rung at the facility , officials believe this was the first real alarm in the history of the plant since it opened in 1999			1
because the plant was in shutdown mode , no employees were underground when the alarm went off and none of the 139 workers above ground were exposed			1
the alarm system automatically switched the the facility 's ventilation system to filtration in order to keep the leak from reaching the surface			1
the @entity26 sits over salt deposits which help seal transuranic waste discarded from the country 's nuclear weapons program such as machinery and clothing			2
the salt deposits keep the material from contaminating water supplies since it takes about a billion years for water to move an inch in the deposits			0
the plant processes some 6,000 cubic meters of radiative waste a year and employs 800 people			1
it is expected to continue accepting materials until 2030			0
waiting to investigate : officials still do n't know what caused the leak or how much was leaked			1

an alarm went off at the facility near @entity27 , @entity16 friday night around 11pm
none of the site 's employees were exposed to radiation
officials do n't know what caused the leak or how much radiation was leaked
this is the first real alarm at the facility since it opened in 1999
the @entity26 process 6,000 cubic meters of radioactive material every year
