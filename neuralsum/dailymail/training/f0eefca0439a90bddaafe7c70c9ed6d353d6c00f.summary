@entity1 captain @entity0 is not guaranteed his starting place back even when fully fit because of the form of stand - ins @entity4 and @entity6			1
manager @entity7 insists the @entity9 defender has a ‘ fight ’ ahead to earn selection given @entity1 have not lost since the deputy centre backs stepped up			1
@entity4 , 25 , and @entity6 , 22 , have started the last four @entity14 games due to calf injuries to @entity0 and @entity16 , as well as @entity18 ’s knee problem			1
@entity1 captain @entity0 ( right ) is back in contention for a starting place in central defence but the form of stand - ins @entity4 ( left ) and @entity6 mean @entity0 is not guaranteed a place draws with @entity26 and @entity27 were followed by wins over @entity29 and @entity30			1
@entity0 , whose last game was the draw at @entity33 , is back in training and in contention for saturday ’s game against @entity37 - but he is by no means a certainty once he is 100 per cent fit			1
‘ you earn the right then you ’re in the team , ’ said @entity7			0
‘ your job is to stay in it			0
those two lads have been playing really well now			0
‘ i ’m sure @entity0 , @entity16 and @entity18 will know that there ’s a really big fight on for them to get in the side			1
you need that competition for people to play on top of their game			0
the @entity1 skipper trains at @entity57 ahead of this weekend 's clash with @entity37 ‘ @entity4 and @entity59 have been absolutely excellent for us and have struck up a good understanding			1
they ’re in form and there ’s a good little partnership developing there			0
‘ in the four games they ’ve played together they ’ve been outstanding , the two of them			2
sometimes you just stumble on things and it works			0
‘ to be fair to @entity59 , he had 14 months out before he played @entity26 and that ’s a long , long time out of football			0
‘ to come in and perform the way he has - his standards have been exceptionally high			0
and @entity4 seems to be thriving on the responsibility , helping him through it			2
’ @entity7 will set two personal records if @entity1 win at @entity78			2
@entity1 have not gone six games unbeaten under his stewardship , nor won three games on the run			2
@entity4 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) have featured in two wins and two draws for @entity1 in the last four games			1

@entity0 could return from injury against @entity37
@entity1 captain has not played since the draw at @entity33
but he is not guaranteed to return *straight* into the starting line - up
@entity4 and @entity6 are *impressing* and could *retain* places
