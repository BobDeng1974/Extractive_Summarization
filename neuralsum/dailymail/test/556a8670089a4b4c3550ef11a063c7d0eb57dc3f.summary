the mystery of what appears to be a screw fixed inside a rock has perplexed scientists an object that appears to be a screw fixed inside a rock has captured the world 's attention since it was found in the 1990s , but the debate rages on about what it really is			1
@entity14 researchers believe the unusual object is 300 million years old , leading some people to claim that it may be proof of a highly advanced lost human civilisation , or even the work of aliens			1
however , experts suggest that there may be a more earthly answer – that the ‘ screw ’ is in fact a fossilised sea creature			1
the researchers stumbled across the ‘ screw ’ after searching the @entity30 after an asteroid strike occurred there , @entity27 reported			1
the ‘ screw ’ measures an inch ( 2cm ) long and was collected by a @entity34 and paranormal research team called the @entity35			1
they claim that the stone is between 300 and 320 million years old and after x-raying it , believe there is another hidden ‘ screw ’ inside the stone			1
but more conventional scientists have not got a look at the object , so have had to base their speculation on grainy pictures posted online			2
the @entity35 has not said what the screw is made of , or given any detailed information about it			0
the self - styled group , which is also known as @entity53 and the @entity54 , conducts expeditions to sites that are believed to have extraterrestrial activity or unusual creatures - and has a mixed reputation			0
fossils of @entity67 crinoids collected in @entity68 are pictured the leading hypothesis from experts who have seen photos of the stone is that the ‘ screw ' is actually the remains of an ancient sea creature called a crinoid			1
the screw - like shape may actually be the reversed - shape of the creature , which gradually dissolved while the rock formed around it			2
some 600 species of @entity83 are now extinct but the creatures live on in different forms in modern seas			1
they have five arms to snatch passing prey and a hidden mouth on the top			0
it is thought that the fossilised creature in the mysterious rock is a form of ‘ sea lily ’ – a type of crinoid that grew a stalk when it became an adult , to tether itself to the seabed			2
crinoids were extremely common millions of years ago , and countless fossils have been found , some segments of which do resemble screws			2
@entity14 researchers have dated the unusual ' screw ' to 300 million years old , leading some people to claim that it may be proof of a highly advanced lost human civilisation , or even the work of aliens ( stock image ) researchers stumbled across the ‘ screw ’ after searching the @entity30 after an asteroid strike occurred there			1
the ‘ screw ’ measures an inch ( 2cm ) long and was collected by a @entity34 and paranormal research team called the @entity35 there are hundreds of species of extinct @entity83 , although the marine animal continues to live in seas today			1
crinoids have a mouth on the top surface - next to their gut and anus - that 's surrounded by feeding arms to grab passing prey			0
they generally have five main arms and a stem to attach themselves to rocks or the seabed			0
in fossilised form , the stem does resemble a screw			2
it 's thought they were more common in ancient times , because limestone beds dating to the mid @entity142 are full of @entity83 fossils			2
the first @entity83 are thought to have appeared in the @entity145 period , between 488 million years ago and ending 444 million years ago and underwent a selective mass extinction at the end of the @entity149 period , where they evolved more flexible arms			1
crinoid fossils look slightly different to reflect the variations across the species			0
however , some say that the stalks of crinoids were typically much smaller than the ‘ screw ’ , with slightly different markings , and have discarded the theory			0
more far - fetched theories include that the ' screw ' is the remains of an ancient form of technology that proves aliens lived on @entity167 millions of years ago , or that our ancestors were far more advanced than we think			1
@entity170 , author of the @entity171 told @entity172 : ‘ lots of out - of - place artefacts have been reported , such as nails or even tools embedded in ancient stone			0
' some of these reports are … misinterpretations of natural formations			0
‘ in this case sceptics claim the screw is nothing more than the fossilised remains of a crinoid marine animal , while believers note that the screw is very different from the surrounding fossil evidence			2
‘ it would be great to think we could find such ancient evidence of a spaceship visiting us so long ago , but we have to consider whether extra-terrestrial spacecraft builders would use screws in the construction of their craft			0
‘ it also seems that this story is probably a hoax that is being spread by the internet , and reflects our desire to believe that extra-terrestrials have visited us in the past and are still visiting us today in what we now call ufos			0
’ the leading hypothesis is that the ‘ screw ; is actually the remains of an ancient sea creature called a crinoid			1
it had a thick stem that attached it to the sea bed , which looks a bit like a screw when it 's fossilised ( pictured ) some 600 species of @entity83 are now extinct but the creatures live on in new forms in our seas today			1
this image shows a modern @entity83 , known as a variable bushy feather star in the @entity224 the @entity225 that terrified people in the 1979 sci - fi film , was inspired by a crinoid			2
@entity230 surrealist artist , @entity229 , created many artworks based on fossils , which were seen by @entity233 who commissioned @entity229 to make props for his film			0
mr @entity229 's designs - one of which was all too memorably seen bursting out of a character 's chest on screen - went on to win his team an @entity241 for @entity242 for @entity243 on the 1979 film and the franchise that followed			0
the @entity225 that terrified people in the 1979 sci - fi film , @entity225 ( pictured ) was inspired by a @entity83 he was inspired by a 300 - million - year - old @entity83 fossil , which was stolen in 2012			1
while the piece was returned to the @entity253 dinosaur museum in @entity254 , @entity230 , from which it was taken , it was slightly damaged			0
museum curator dr. @entity256 said : ' it was comparatively undamaged - although one of the arms had broken off			0
' it really is a remarkable fossil and shows two separate species of a spineless animal that lived at the bottom of the sea around 300 million years ago			1
' a museum spokesman added : ' it is a very valuable but also a very unique fossil and it will be very difficult for anybody to sell or indeed to keep secret given the publicity around the theft			0
' alien abduction : @entity230 surrealist artist , @entity229 , created many artworks based on fossils , which were seen by @entity233 who commissioned @entity229 to make props for his film			0
this rare @entity83 fossil was stolen from a museum and later returned damaged			2

' screw ' was found in a stone by @entity34 researchers in @entity30 , @entity14
the unusual object is said to be 300 million years old
some think it 's proof aliens used to live on @entity167 or a radical civilisation
but it 's more likely to be a fossilised sea creature called a @entity83
