if you think you have seen a ghost , you may have been suffering the effects of exposure to mould , according to a group of scientists			2
researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings are usually reported , often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould , which can affect our brains			1
exposure to the mould can cause mood swings , irrational anger and cognitive impairment			1
all an illusion ? researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings ( illustrated by a stock image ) are usually reported , often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould , which can affect our brains ‘ experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds , ’ said professor @entity24 of @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
‘ psychoactive effects of some fungi are well - known , whereas the effects of others such as indoor moulds are less researched			1
‘ although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established , there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other functioning of the brain			2
‘ reports of psychiatric symptoms including mood swings , hyperactivity , and irrational anger , as well as cognitive impairment are prevalent among those exposed to moulds			1
brain drain : exposure to the mould can cause mood swings , irrational anger and cognitive impairment , among other problems			1
a stock image of toxic mould in the firm of @entity64 chartarum spores , is shown ' ghosts ' tend to be sighted in old buildings , which are often more likely to have damp and mould problems			1
no - one is exactly sure of the psychoactive effects of indoor moulds on the brain			2
but spores have been linked with mood swings , hyperactivity , and irrational anger , as well as cognitive impairment			1
recent reports indicate that exposure to toxic mould spores may cause brain inflammation and memory loss			2
a team of researchers are exploring whether the mould may cause people to think they have seen ghosts , by comparing conditions in ' haunted ' and non-haunted old buildings			1
‘ other reports include depression and loss of memory function			0
‘ more recent work is emerging that supports brain inflammation and memory loss in mice exposed to @entity98 , a common indoor air mould , as well as increased anxiety and fear			0
’ professor @entity24 is currently leading a team of researchers measuring air quality in several reportedly haunted places around @entity107			0
the group will compare samples taken from several buildings where ghost sightings have been reported with samples taken from properties with no paranormal activity , to see if there is a difference in the types of fungi			0
professor @entity24 said : ‘ i have long been a fan of ghost stories and shows related to investigation of haunted places and have to admit to some strange occurrences in my own past			0
‘ many of the places under investigation and from my own experiences may be prime environments for mould and other indoor air quality issues			0
‘ we would like to see if we can parse out some commonality between the mould microbiome in places that are haunted relative to those that are not			2
’ the real ghost busters : here , undergraduate environmental engineering students ( from left to right ) @entity140 and @entity141 work with professor @entity24 to sample air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity the team have only just begun their investigations , but have been to a handful of ‘ haunted ’ buildings to collect samples , as well as properties with mould , but no connection to ghosts			1
‘ in one historic house turned into an office building there have been reports of noises , moving ceiling tiles , moving items on shelves and desks , apparitions , and a general feeling of unease among building occupants , ’ he said			0
‘ there have been long - standing stories of some of the original family members still occupying the place			0
‘ in another location , the @entity173 in @entity174 @entity27 , there is a long history of ghost stories involving the former occupants and others			2
‘ a week prior to our visit , they had a visit from a psychic who took a reading in several rooms in the museum that we then used to target our air quality studies			0
‘ she reported a few “ folks ” came to speak with her , children running in and out of some of the rooms in the house , and a woman that claimed she was " not won in a poker game ” , which was related to a long - time story related to the @entity203 family			0
‘ so far , we have n’t been spooked out of a location , but time will tell			0
’ the team have only just begun their investigations , but have been to a handful of ‘ haunted ’ buildings to collect samples , as well as properties with mould , but no connection to ghosts			1
for example , they have visited the @entity173 in @entity174 @entity27 ( pictured ) , where there is a long history of ghost stories			0

@entity25 experts are probing the link between mould and ghosts
they are carrying out their investigations in old buildings in @entity27
think spores in old ' haunted ' buildings may affect people *'s* brains
psychoactive effects of mould are *unclear* but cause cognitive impairment
