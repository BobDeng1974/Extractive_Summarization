by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 published : 03:43 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 06:45 est , 30 january 2014 police have launched a criminal negligence investigation into whether a @entity9 socialite who jumped to her death from the roof @entity7 plastic surgery was suffering from a reaction to anaesthetic			1
@entity14 , 53 , a jeweller who had worked for the @entity16 ’s supplier @entity17 , was apparently recovering from a facelift when she threw off her clothing , ran to the building 's 15th storey roof and jumped to her death			1
now investigators are reportedly trying to establish whether the @entity24 clinic owned by ' surgeon to the stars ' dr @entity26 was in any way negligent in its care of the mother - of - two			1
tragedy : the woman who jumped to her death from a 15 - storey building in @entity7 has been identified as @entity9 socialite @entity14 , who used to work for @entity34 jeweller @entity17 distressed : @entity35 was seen sitting on the roof of the sleek black building , pictured , before jumping police spent three hours unsuccessfully attempting to talk the @entity40 - based mother - of - two down as she sat naked with her legs dangling over a ledge ( pictured ) police spent three hours trying to talk the mother - of - two down as she sat naked with her legs dangling over a ledge			1
mrs @entity14 , who lived in @entity40 , was known for making one - of - a - kind jewellery and often donated profits from her business to charity			1
there are a number of rare but serious physical complications resulting from general and local anesthetics , including increased risk of respiratory depression and heart attacks			0
but the true effect of anesthesia on the human mind remains somewhat unclear			0
one worrying symptom is emergence delirium - a temporary mental condition affecting around 5 per cent of patients that can result in a state of heightened emotion or excitement in the hours or days after anesthesia			1
patients suffering emergence delirium may also experience temporary psychomotor agitation , the symptoms of which include seemingly odd behaviour such as pacing around a room , removing clothing and in more extreme cases self - harming			1
other patients reports extreme long and short - term changes in personality following anesthesia , including developing bouts of depression and anxiety			2
in 2006 , talented 21 - year - old student @entity81 committed suicide just 10 days after a minor operation			1
he had told his mother he ' did n't feel right ' after the surgery , and sunk into a deep depression that saw him desperately contacting doctors for help before eventually committing suicide			1
it has since emerged that the anesthetics @entity92 was administered have all been linked to depression , anxiety or suicidal thoughts			0
since his death , @entity92 ' mother @entity96 claims to have compiled a large amount of evidence that suggests many clinicians and pharmacologists believe there is a small but definite link between the drugs used in anaesthetics and suicidal behaviour			0
she is said to have undergone a facelift at the @entity109 office of dr @entity26 in @entity7 last tuesday and was kept there overnight for observation			0
according to the @entity114 , the clinic is now at the centre of a police criminal negligence investigation			1
the patient woke the following morning ‘ agitated and aggressive ’ and , according to an office worker , was pulling at her hair before dashing up to the roof at 7am			1
‘ she sat on the ledge naked , then got up and walked around the edge of the building as if on a tightrope			0
she sat back down again before getting up and jumping off , ’ said a witness			0
@entity7 police confirmed they are investigating the death , but refused to comment further			0
a rare post-operation complication known as ‘ emergence delirium ’ can result in a state of heightened emotion or excitement in the hours or days after anaesthesia and affects around 5 per cent of patients			0
sufferers may also experience temporary ‘ psychomotor agitation ’ – restless movements that stem from mental tension – including pacing around a room , removing clothing and , in some extreme cases , self - harming			2
dr @entity26 has not yet commented			0
he has been credited with performing facelifts and other cosmetic operations on some of the biggest stars in the entertainment business			0
he was once described as the ‘ best plastic surgeon no one will recommend ’ because his famous patients pay high prices to look as if they have not had any work done at all			0
@entity150 , a former colleague of mrs @entity14 at the @entity151 in @entity40 , where she was a director , said : ‘ it was a tragic incident			2
it has been a very difficult time for her family			0
‘ she was @entity9 and married with two children			2
it would not be appropriate for me to say anything more as the death is still under investigation			0
’ the jeweller was born in @entity162 to @entity9 parents and grew up in @entity164 and @entity165			2
her @entity167 husband @entity166 , a former @entity168 executive , runs a cosmetics business from @entity40			0
mother - of - two @entity35 ( left ) was listed in @entity172 's list of top 500 people			1
she is believed to have had a facelift at a clinic owned by ' surgeon to the stars ' dr @entity26 ( right ) hours before her suicide tragic : a crisis negotiation team was sent to the building to try to talk @entity35 down mr @entity166 ’s 12 - year - old son , @entity181 , drowned in a swimming pool in @entity183 in 2004 , according to a 2008 article in the @entity185			1
mrs @entity14 ’s biography on the @entity151 website states she had been involved with @entity151 since 1999 and ‘ despite being a wonderful and busy mother , wife and friend , she always has plenty of time to help anyone in need ’			1
in 2006 , 21 - year - old @entity81 , son of the @entity196 , committed suicide ten days after a minor operation			2
the student told his mother he ‘ did n’t feel right ’ after the surgery and became severely depressed before killing himself .			2
