a keen artist , prince @entity0 knows that a person can be portrayed in many different ways			1
so when he saw two less than flattering drawings of himself yesterday , he was able to see the funny side			2
the @entity0 was visiting an arts facility he set up 14 years ago which has been renamed the @entity7 after being granted the title by the @entity9			1
prince @entity0 visited the arts facility in @entity11 , @entity12 , that he set up 14 years ago to reveal it has been renamed the @entity7 after being granted permission for the prestigious title by the @entity9 during his visit , prince @entity0 was sketched by a number of artists before being shown the drawings ( above ) @entity20 , 24 , a former student , and @entity22 , 23 , in her first year at the school , quickly sketched the prince as he viewed the drawings on display			1
@entity0 told them : ' well , i 've been mostly facing the wrong way for you			1
' miss @entity20 replied : ' yes , we 've got a lot of good ones from the back of your head			0
it 's been the drawing school paparazzi			0
' the @entity0 went to look at @entity39 's picture but on catching a glimpse of it from behind her , said ' oh , maybe i had better not			1
' miss @entity20 met @entity0 at @entity44 last year and at @entity45 over the summer			1
when the @entity0 last met her , he chose some of her pictures to take with him			1
miss @entity22 said she was too nervous to show her drawing to the prince because of his reaction to @entity39 's			2
she told him : ' your expressions are entrenched into your face			0
' he went on to ask her where she had studied and she told him she completed an art degree in @entity56			0
prince @entity0 set up the @entity57 in @entity12 14 years ago with artist @entity58 she added : ' he 's very pleasant - he 's very quick to smile			1
i noticed as well he has the art of giving a speech without having to learn it so he can look around at people			0
' the @entity0 also spoke to @entity64 , another alumnus			1
he has two of her paintings in his house and told her : ' they 're lovely and i have got them framed , they 're hanging up			0
' he told miss @entity64 that he was planning a @entity72 for behind @entity73 in @entity74			0
he said : ' do you know of anyone in @entity74 that can help with that ? ' miss @entity64 said the plan was to have something like the @entity81 in @entity12			1
@entity0 set up the @entity57 14 years ago with artist @entity58			1
it teaches more than 1,000 students each week in its studios around @entity12			2
it is the first arts education institution to be permitted use of the prestigious title ' royal ' since the @entity89 in 1956			2
the prince , who visited its main campus in @entity11 , @entity12 , to make the announcement , said : ' drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world and , like music and dance , needs to be taught and practised throughout an artist 's life			1
' ' i am determined that the @entity7 will continue to grow as an educational resource open to all , regardless of background or circumstance			2
' the prince paints and sketches whenever he has the time , but his passion lies with using watercolours the prince ( pictured in 1998 ) has used watercolours since the 1970s when artist @entity113 taught him addressing the audience , @entity0 said : ' it 's lovely to see so many of you here this afternoon			1
judging by the noise , i feel awkward about interrupting you and your jolly conversation			0
' he also spoke of the origin of the school and said : ' it was our hope that we could provide a space in which expert teachers could help our students to see the world through clarity and sensitivity whether that vision was ultimately expressed through painting , sculpture , illustration , drawing , animation or design			0
' the school is following in the footsteps of the @entity139 , which took its name in 1768 , the @entity141 in 1882 , the @entity142 in 1896 , and the @entity143 in 1920			0
miss @entity58 , artistic director of the school , said it was unique within @entity145			0
she said : '' i feel very proud that we have come this far since we began in 2000 , because i 'm more and more persuaded of the need for a drawing school as a permanent part of the @entity153 's educational resources , ' she said			0
the prince , a keen artist , said : ' drawing is one of the most direct ways of engaging with the world ' the @entity7 ( pictured ) said the new title recognised its academic and artistic excellence ' there is n't another one in @entity145 , and we are being sought out by students from all over the world			1
' the school - an independent educational charity - said the new title recognised its academic and artistic excellence and served to reinforce its position as a respected and integral part of the art education landscape			2
the prince paints and sketches whenever he has the time , but his passion lies with using watercolours			0
he has used them since the 1970s when artist @entity113 gave him a lesson			0
the @entity0 usually depicts landscapes - from the @entity179 estate in @entity180 to the mountain resort of @entity182 - taking his inspiration from nature .			2
