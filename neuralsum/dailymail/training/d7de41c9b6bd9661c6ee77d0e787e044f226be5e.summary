teachers have been accused of neglecting textbooks at the expense of producing worksheets or trawling the internet for information ministers will today urge schools to bring back traditional textbooks to end a growing reliance on worksheets and the internet			1
they will say that an ‘ anti-textbook ethos ’ has contributed to @entity12 ’s slide in international rankings of pupils ’ performance in key academic subjects			0
in a speech to the @entity20 , school reform minister @entity18 will call on all schools – both primary and secondary – to reintroduce good quality textbooks in most subjects			1
he will complain that teachers too often neglect textbooks in favour of producing worksheets or ‘ endlessly trawling the internet ’ for suitable material for their lessons			2
mr @entity18 will also highlight new research from exams body @entity35 which shows that teachers in top - performing countries are significantly more likely to use textbooks than in @entity12			1
the research ‘ should rightly send shockwaves through the education system and the publishing industry , ’ mr @entity18 will say			2
in @entity44 , 95 per cent of maths teachers use a textbook as a basis for lessons and in @entity48 , the figure is 70 per cent			0
in contrast , only 10 per cent of maths teachers in @entity12 use a textbook for their core teaching – and only four per cent in science			0
‘ in the controversial search for the reasons why a range of key nations have improved their systems so dramatically and so quickly , the role of high quality textbooks has been seriously neglected , ’ mr @entity18 will say			2
‘ well - focused , forensic study of these nations highlights the extent to which good teaching and high academic standards are strongly associated with adequate provision and widespread use of high quality textbooks			0
’ and he will say : ‘ once again @entity12 has fallen behind			0
’ in other leading nations such as @entity48 , 70 per cent of maths lessons are taught from a textbook , while in @entity70 the figure is 95 per cent - in the @entity74 it is just ten per cent mr @entity18 will suggest that teacher trainers and researchers , rather than teachers themselves , are responsible for the marginalisation of textbooks			1
he will also lay down a challenge to educational publishers to drive up the quality of textbooks in @entity12			0
‘ all the evidence shows that high quality textbooks are good for teachers , students and parents , ’ he will say			0
‘ for teachers , well - structured textbooks reduce workload and the perpetual ritual of producing worksheets ; for students , knowledge - rich textbooks mean they can read beyond the confines of the exam syllabus and using textbooks helps to develop those all - important scholarship skills ; and for parents , textbooks are a guide to what their children are being taught in school			1
‘ i would like to see all schools , both primary and secondary , using high quality textbooks in most academic subjects , bringing us closer to the norm in high performing countries			1
