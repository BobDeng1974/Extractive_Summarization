by @entity0 campaigners today warned of a ' seismic shift ' in privacy invasion after it emerged that @entity5 was the latest company set to market a television set - top box equipped with a camera that stares back at viewers			1
the company , which makes the microchips found inside most personal computers , has launched an entirely new division , @entity12 , to make and market the orwellian streaming - television product			1
@entity14 ( pictured ) , vice-president of @entity12 , said the new service would offer users a tv ' that is much more personal , that learns about you , that actually cares about who you are			1
' ' tv that actually cares ' : @entity14 , vice president of the new @entity12 division of the microchip maker , defended the product against privacy concerns in an interview at @entity27 's @entity26 conference the camera , @entity5 claims , will enable them to personalise the interactive features of their product , so that different members of the same household can be served programming and advertising specific to them			1
@entity5 is only the latest company to develop a television product that contains a camera and sensors designed to watch what viewers are up to			1
@entity45 cable provider @entity44 sparked outrage in december when it applied to patent a set - top box technology that can observe what 's going on in the room and show viewers adverts based on what it detects in @entity45 patent application 20120304206 the company suggests it could detect when people are ' cuddling ' then show ' a commercial for a romantic getaway vacation , a commercial for a contraceptive , a commercial for flowers [ ... ] etc. '			1
@entity61 also recently registered a patent for technology to allow its @entity65 motion sensor to figure out how many people are in front of it then stop playback if it detected more people than the copyright terms allowed			0
@entity72 proposed a similar patent that would use video and audio recording devices to do the same			0
and @entity76 in 2008 patented a monitoring technology that would recommend content to users based on people it recognised in the room			1
the surge in products that look back at you will no doubt spark associations with @entity88 's dystopian classic @entity89 , in which an oppressed population live in fear of surveillance through two - way ' telescreens '			2
the book 's hero , @entity94 , is only able to keep a diary - a banned activity - because one corner of his old - fashioned flat is out of the view of the telescreen 's camera			2
@entity103 as @entity94 in the film @entity89 : the hero of the story , @entity94 is only able to keep a diary because one corner of his flat is out of the view of his televisions integral surveillance camera @entity14 , vice-president of @entity12 , spoke to @entity27 's @entity26 conference this week , where he gave official confirmation of @entity5 's long - rumoured entry into the telescreen market			1
he said : ' this thing looks like a leap in time of 10 - 20 years compared to what you have today , that is much more personal , that learns about you , that actually cares about who you are			2
' he added : ' we think there 's real value in the ability to actually identify the various users			0
today television does n't really know anything about you and it 's the same television service for everyone in the household			0
' challenged about the privacy implications surrounding a television service which is designed to look back at the viewer , he said : ' we think there 's real value in the ability to actually identify the various users			2
' today television does n't really know anything about you and it 's the same television service for everyone in the household			0
' @entity5 's new set - top box product is not the first technology that encroaches on the privacy of families ' living rooms			1
@entity44 recently applied for a patent for a set - top box equipped with sensors to detect the characteristics and activities of viewers and serve advertising to suit before that , @entity61 registered a patent for technology to allow its @entity65 motion sensor to figure out how many people are in front of it then stop playback if it detected more people than the copyright terms allowed			2
@entity72 proposed a similar patent that would use video and audio recording devices to do the same			0
and @entity76 in 2008 patented a monitoring technology that would recommend content to users based on people it recognised in the room			2
@entity174 's @entity173 already comes equipped with cameras and microphones , although they are not linked to a system which delivers personalised content			1
@entity180 - born mr @entity14 gave a personal example drawn from his own family life , where his children 's use of his @entity186 account means that when he and his wife use it the service often suggests cartoons for them to watch			2
' my kids may watch programming geared toward them , and i ’ll watch programming geared toward me , ' he said			0
' if there ’s a way to distinguish who is watching what , advertisers can then target ads at the proper parties			0
' he also promised that the final product would ship with a ' shutter ' over its camera 's lens , allowing users fearful of being watched to block its view			0
privacy campaigners nevertheless reacted with horror to the product , which @entity5 intends to sell directly to the public as soon as later this year			1
@entity214 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity216 , said : ' the idea that your television is watching you as you watch is a seismic shift in privacy protection			1
' this is data collection solely for commercial purposes and most people wo n’t realise that this is even happening			0
' it highlights why proper regulation is essential so companies are n’t free to scan and search your living room – or wherever you have a tv – to record more information on who is watching			0
' at least this camera will have a physical way of blocking it , but with a range of smart televisions there is no way to block the in - built camera and microphones			0
' given the widespread concerns about these devices being hacked over the internet , they could well end up being @entity88 ’s telescreens controlled by strangers with a laptop			0
