the cheer for an @entity2 - ridden winner this week might be loud but the decibel level could be matched if a runner trained by @entity5 reaches the winner ’s enclosure			1
and thursday might be that day as the @entity5 - trained lieutenant colonel is 8 - 1 third favourite for the @entity10 , while the @entity11 is no forlorn hope in the opening @entity15 ’ @entity14			1
both will also carry a wave of sentimental support from the @entity20 crowd as @entity5 took over the family stables close to the @entity22 after her father , @entity23 , lost his fight against cancer in november			1
@entity5 celebrates victory at @entity27 with lieutenant colonel and jockey @entity29 a @entity33 legend , @entity23 ’s eight wins as a jockey included the 1977 @entity34 on @entity35 and the 1979 @entity36 on @entity37			1
they were matched by eight winners as a trainer , headed by the back - to - back @entity36 victories of @entity43 in 2004 and 2005			1
appropriately , the track have named the prize for this week ’s top trainer in @entity23 ’s honour			1
it is a tribute that the @entity5 family appreciate but securing a winner with what @entity5 refers to as ‘ dad ’s horses ’ would be even more special			1
@entity5 , whose @entity54 unseated its jockey in the @entity14 on tuesday , said : ‘ it is great to get dad ’s horses here because that is what he would have wanted			1
everything he did each season was working towards it , so to be honoured is lovely			2
trainer @entity62 , who passed away in november last year , celebrates with @entity29 in the winners enclosure after our @entity65 's win in the @entity67 ‘ we always came as a family so it is quite tough not having him here , but i feel he is looking down on me			1
and to see the warmth and the love people had for him was genuinely overwhelming			2
there is a big contingent over with us , the usual crew			2
the head of the ship is missing but we are here to make him proud			2
’ with @entity5 this week is @entity23 ’s widow , @entity80 , and his son , @entity81 , the three - time flat racing champion jockey who last week announced he will be setting up training in @entity83 next year			1
but it was always the plan that @entity5 would take the helm at her father ’s stable			1
she said : ‘ i thought it would be in 10 or 15 years ’ time			2
i never realised it would be this quick			2
but things happen and you just have to get on with it			0
our whole life revolved around putting the horses first and that is what we had to do			0
‘ me and @entity81 are very close			0
it is great to have him for advice , even if it is at the end of a phone call			0
thankfully , i inherited a fabulous team of horses and a fabulous staff and it is working so far			0
’ jockeys line up to observe a minute 's silence at @entity110 after the death of trainer @entity5 the @entity11 is so called because it is the nickname of @entity115 rugby forward @entity114			1
owner @entity116 said : ‘ i bought the horse from a friend of @entity114 and he was there at @entity27 when he won his beginners chase			0
we had a couple of drinks and a good chat			0
‘ he is keen enough on his racing			0
his day job is a farmer when he is not playing rugby			0
‘ the horse won first time out and disappointed on his next two runs but we identified reasons for that			0
we are hoping he will put up a good show and is on his way back			0
’ a win for the @entity11 would be popular as @entity116 suffered the blow of losing @entity5 - trained @entity138 in a fatal fall in last year ’s @entity36			1
the hand of @entity23 is also very much behind the path steered by lieutenant colonel this season			1
he had always wanted a six - year - old he felt was some way off maturity to have another season over hurdles so , after he was beaten in his first steeplechase at @entity149 in november , @entity5 was delighted when his owners , @entity152 boss @entity151 and his racing manager brother @entity153 , suggested he switch back to the smaller obstacles			1
it has been a highly successful decision with two @entity157 wins snapped up — the @entity159 ’s @entity158 at @entity27 a few days after @entity23 died and the @entity160 in december , beating @entity162 ’s @entity161 on both occasions			2
@entity5 added : ‘ he ran in a beginners chase and he was a little bit disappointing but it was always dad ’s plan to keep him over hurdles for an extra year			2
he thought it would make a man of him			0
‘ so i was delighted when @entity153 and @entity151 suggested going back over hurdles again , and @entity172 kicked in again			0
it was what dad wanted			0
’ @entity5 fits first - time cheekpieces on lieutenant colonel , who will be ridden by @entity29 , and is also optimistic the @entity11 will run well			1
‘ i am very happy with him			0
his jumping has been a little bit of an issue but he jumped well at @entity180 last time and we feel we have him spot on			0
this was the race he was trained for all year so hopefully we will get it right			0
