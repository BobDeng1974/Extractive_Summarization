by @entity0 some predicted death from ‘ sulphurous ’ fumes , others that the capital would collapse			1
many warned of ruinous costs which would never be recouped ( they were n’t wrong on that point )			1
but thanks to a handful of indefatigable , high - minded @entity12 , one of the most ambitious engineering projects in history not only went on to shape @entity16 , it has since been copied by almost every major city on the planet			1
more than that , the @entity19 has become part of the @entity22 , a symbol of national creativity and resilience			1
in war , it protected hundreds of thousands			1
in peace , it created the suburban dream for millions of families			1
led by mayor @entity45 , they will board an original @entity19 train — leather and velvet in first class ; benches in third — and travel three and a half miles from @entity52 to @entity53			1
but what makes it an even more historic journey is the workhorse at the front — an original @entity60 steam locomotive			1
there has n’t been a steam - powered passenger journey on the @entity19 since @entity63 reigned			1
@entity34 : @entity0 takes a late night journey on the underground steam engine which will carry a group of @entity41 on sunday of course , anyone who has actually used the tube — and a record 1.17 billion people did so last year — will immediately ask themselves the same question : how on earth did the tube cope in the age of steam ? it can be fetid enough today in a modern electric carriage			1
funnily enough , it is not that unpleasant			1
there ’s plenty of white wispy smoke , of course , but i ’d rather breathe this than the exhaust fumes at a busy road junction			1
i have managed to secure a seat for the trial run ahead of tomorrow ’s big occasion			1
clouds waft in through the open windows of my eight - seat compartment , but there ’s just a scent of bonfire			1
i have shared @entity95 with more objectionable takeaway meals			1
what is overwhelming , though , is the atmosphere			1
it is getting on for 2am			1
@entity100 can only test all this renovated rolling stock on an empty network			1
so the only onlookers are a few diehard steam enthusiasts			1
none of them has seen anything quite like this , though			1
what a gloriously incongruous feeling it is to chuff - chuff through familiar @entity16 landmarks , past advertisements for airlines and wi - fi and mobile phones , in a maroon first class carriage built for @entity12 , with adverts for soap and day trips to @entity120			1
by day , these stations are heaving			1
now , they are closed , half - lit , eerily silent			1
it ’s as if a ghost train from @entity125 has sneaked back to revisit old haunts			1
the very same lightwells which poured daylight and fresh air down on that original tube line are still in the walls			1
we clatter through @entity135 — or @entity136 as it was called back then — and on through @entity138			1
shiny signs on shiny walls direct passengers to @entity143 trains heading for the continent			1
yet the @entity145 was still in living memory when this track was built			2
here and there , maintenance workers stop to give us a standing ovation or film it on their phones			2
the capital is fast asleep but the driver of @entity154 , @entity155 , 45 , can not resist the odd blast on his whistle			2
‘ you ’d have to be completely heartless not to be excited by this , ’ says sir @entity158 , @entity16 ’s wide - eyed @entity159 , as we stop at @entity160 to take on water and check the dials			2
it ’s taken years to restore this train			2
back in time : the @entity168 will pull the @entity170 carriage no 353 some of the volunteer helpers have been invited along for the ride , so excited they can hardly speak			1
at around 3am , a whistle orders us all back on board for the return			2
i sit next to @entity178 , director of the @entity179 and co-author of ‘ @entity19 ’ , an absorbing new history of the @entity36			2
tonight ’s speed is around 20mph but @entity178 points out that everything was much slower on opening day , 1863 : ‘ it was chaos and the journey took about two and a half hours			2
’ the story of the @entity36 is full of pioneers and crooks , but it had a nobility of purpose from the start			2
for that , we can thank @entity193 , the @entity195 ’s solicitor , who argued passionately that the lot of the ordinary @entity197 would be much improved with a subterranean railway ( he died before he could see the result )			2
another @entity36 author , @entity200 , recounts hostility to the idea in her new book , @entity204			2
‘ the forthcoming end of the world will be hastened by the construction of the railways burrowing into infernal regions and thereby disturbing the @entity212 , ’ wrote the @entity206 dr @entity205 in 1860			1
yet there was only one notable absentee from the euphoric opening on january 9th 1863			2
the prime minister , @entity216 , explained that , at 79 , he would prefer to remain above ground a little longer			2
the new @entity218 was an instant hit			2
opened to the public , it carried nearly 40,000 on its first day			2
but with so many steam engines operating in a confined space , the cumulative effect was alarming			1
that same day , a porter was hospitalised due to the ‘ vitiated atmosphere ’ and several people were left ‘ insensible ’ from fumes			2
ticket to ride : an early @entity218 third class ticket legacy : this @entity34 steam - powered vehicle remained in service until the 1960s still , a rival soon emerged			1
the @entity236 — known as the @entity237 — started taking shape from @entity239 to @entity240			2
eventually , the two railways linked up to create the ‘ @entity244 ’ around central @entity16 , while both companies furiously maintained their independence			2
as they stretched further out to @entity16 ’s rural fringe , an explosion of housebuilding followed			0
but another player really shook things up in 1890			0
the new @entity195 and @entity16 line , running under the @entity252 to link the southern suburbs with the @entity195 , had only one class , to the dismay of papers like the @entity257 : ‘ we have scarcely yet been educated to that condition of social equality when lords and ladies will be content to ride alongside @entity264 butchers ’			1
more important , the new line ran on electricity			0
the death knell for steam was the dazzling new @entity269 , opened in 1900			1
it had snazzy new electric carriages , a fixed fare and it opened up @entity16 ’s great shopping and theatre districts			0
it also had the @entity276 to thank for an immortal phrase — ‘ the @entity36 ’			0
thereafter , the entire underground would be known , for ever , as ‘ the tube ’			0
everyone wanted to be a part of the new line			0
when @entity284 retailer @entity282 opened his @entity285 in 1909 , he fought — in vain — to get @entity288 station renamed ‘ @entity282 ’s ’			0
then and now : a traveller at @entity128 this week - the station shares the 150th anniversary of its opening on january 10th , 2013 with the @entity19 by 1905 , the @entity293 had surrendered to electricity			0
there would be no more steam - powered passenger trains — until this week ( although some steam engines continued to haul goods )			1
within a year , the @entity300 and @entity301 lines completed a huge @entity303 electric network			0
but it was still something of a disjointed mess until the arrival of one of the most pivotal figures in @entity311 transport history			1
@entity312 was the master of detail who gave the tube its own identity , from station design to lettering to posters to its eternal symbol : the red and blue ‘ roundel ’			0
he also paid ten guineas to a draughtsman called @entity323 for a new map			0
the result , first printed in 1933 , remains a masterpiece			0
in a 2006 @entity329 poll , the @entity323 map was beaten only by @entity330 as the greatest @entity311 design of all time ( and @entity330 was half - @entity333 )			1
yet @entity323 ’s name was removed from the map in 1959 and he died a bitter man in 1974			0
there is an equally unhappy ending to the @entity312 story			0
at the outbreak of war , he was masterminding @entity16 ’s evacuation strategy but fell out with his colleagues and with @entity345 and left			0
he died from a brain haemorrhage two years later			0
in charge : the @entity350 's visit underground in 1969 was her second time experiencing the @entity36			0
her first trip came as a 13 - year - old in 1939 with princess @entity354 and her governess @entity356 going underground : the @entity350 was pictured riding on an escalator in the @entity359 footage filmed at @entity361 station in 1969 the war was , arguably , the @entity36 ’s finest hour			0
yet , at the start of @entity366 , the management tried to stop people sheltering from bombs , fearful that they would never leave and frustrate the @entity19 ’s sacred duty : keeping the capital moving			0
by october 1940 , the authorities relented			0
beds , sanitation and refreshments were introduced			0
at its peak , there were 177,000 sleeping in the @entity19			0
tragedies were glossed over : 79 blown apart at @entity380 , 68 drowned at @entity381 after a bomb ruptured a water main			0
worst of all was a crush at @entity385 which killed 173 , mostly women and children , in 1943			0
with peace came nationalisation , decay and division			0
it took the 1987 @entity393 to reverse the long - term culture of decline			0
the advent of the @entity16 mayoralty and colossal public / private partnerships would help revivify the network to the point that it is busier than ever , carrying 4 million a day , double the 1982 number			0
it remains an endearing paradox			0
we love to complain about the tube			0
and yet , we love it dearly			0
we ’re like an old married couple , bickering yet devoted			0
‘ you ’re not running a rail network , ’ says managing director @entity409 as we chug along			0
‘ you ’re looking after an institution			0
’ it ’s been quite a journey			0
happy 150th , you smelly old thing			0
old - fashioned : the interior of an all - steel @entity16 underground train is pictured around 1920 busy : six underground railway tunnels run under the @entity421 building which is pictured under construction near @entity423 in 1936 underground by @entity425 , @entity426 and @entity178 ( @entity427 , £ 25 ) ; @entity204 by @entity200 ( @entity428 , £ 9.99 )			0

crowd of @entity41 will travel between @entity52 and @entity53
