there was elation inside the @entity3 stadium for fans of the @entity5 last night as they clinched a historic fourth @entity7 win			0
but some fans were bitterly disappointed after finding out they did n't have tickets to attend the game			1
one fan started sobbing as he told how a broker charged him thousands of dollars for tickets but then told him they could n't fulfil his order			1
the @entity15 earned the dubious accolade of the most expensive game in the event 's 49 - year history , with some tickets changing hands on the day for as much as $ 12,000			1
grief : this @entity24 fan from @entity25 , @entity26 , whose name was not given , sobbed as he explained how a ticket broker charged him $ 4,500 for three tickets - then told him it would n't fulfil the order emotion : the man openly wept beside the @entity33 as he told his sad story some ticket resellers were apparently engaged in short - selling , a technique where brokers sell seats before obtaining tickets , planning to buy the tickets at a later date for less money in order to make a profit			1
that technique depends on tickets being available for brokers to purchase closer to the game			2
@entity52 - based reseller @entity50 was forced to admit to customers before this year 's game that it would n't be able to fufill ticket orders , despite already taking hefty deposits			1
one man waiting outside the stadium in @entity3 said he spent $ 1,500 per seat for three seat bookings with @entity60 , only to get a call days before the game saying ' sorry , we ca n't fulfil your order '			1
the @entity24 fan from @entity25 , @entity26 , whose name was not given , sobbed as he told his story to @entity67			2
' for two weeks i thought , for sure , i was going to be in there screaming with the 12th man [ pause ] and now i do n't get to do that , ' he said			0
' it 's upsetting [ pause ] that you could just [ say ] " sorry we do n't have your tickets any more "			2
' stadium : streamers and bunting drift from the roof to the pitch as the @entity5 celebrate their victory over the @entity24 at the @entity85 in @entity86 , @entity87 cheerleaders : @entity5 cheerleaders celebrate their team 's success support : the @entity24 ' cheerleaders perform during the @entity15 , which was watched by millions @entity94 has reportedly been giving 200 per cent refunds to some customers as a result of its failure to supply tickets			1
but many fans were upset nonetheless			0
' our whole bubble has been popped and i 'm just heartbroken , ' said @entity104 , a @entity24 fan from @entity87 who was handed back her $ 4,500 deposit , plus another $ 4,500 on top			1
she told @entity108 that she and her husband had planned to go to the game with her brother			0
however , her brother died earlier this year and mrs @entity104 had planned to take his ashes to the game instead			0
' that was real special thing we were going to do			0
so that 's hard too , ' she said			0
@entity50 told @entity118 that the seller of mrs @entity104 's tickets had told the firm they could not be delivered ' until as late as sunday '			0
' such a delay in delivery is atypical , and therefore we recognize it could be both concerning and result in a substantial inconvenience for ms. @entity104 , ' the company said in explanation for its decision to refund the money			0
there was also speculation that some brokers may have held on to tickets they had already sold because they knew they could get more money selling them to new customers closer to the game .			2

heartbroken fan spent $ 4,500 booking tickets with broker @entity94
but days before the game he got a call saying it could n't fulfil the order
