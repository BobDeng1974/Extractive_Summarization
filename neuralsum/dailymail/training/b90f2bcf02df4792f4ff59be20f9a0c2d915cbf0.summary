a new study has found that men who treat their sleep apnoea experience a better sex life			2
the study involved 61 men from @entity6 and @entity7 who suffered from sleeping disorder and erectile difficulties and found that both conditions improved with continuous positive airway pressure ( @entity14 ) treatment			1
@entity15 , the leader of the study from @entity7 's @entity17 , told @entity18 that the treatment improved the ' overall sexual satisfaction ' of the men involved as the two conditions often come hand in hand			1
the study involved 61 men from @entity6 and @entity7 who suffered from both sleep apnoea and erectile difficulties ' what normally happens during sleep is that men have erections during @entity30 sleep around about every 90 minutes and when they wake up with erection that 's because they woke up in the middle of @entity30 , ' dr @entity15 said			1
' but , if you have sleep apnoea , that can interrupt your sleep and in particular it interrupts @entity30 sleep and also the erections that 's should be happening , so it does n't get that practice overnight that 's needed			0
' dr @entity15 said her study , which took place between 2010 and 2013 , tested men who had never bene treated for sleep apnoea			0
out of the 61 men , 30 received @entity14 treatment and 31 received a placebo treatment			1
a different selection of 31 men were also given an erectile dysfunction drug while the remaining 30 received a placebo			2
' some guys got both , some got none and the rest got one , ' dr @entity15 explained			0
' over the three months we asked them about their sexual activity and how their erections were going and we also measured their erections during their sleep and we found @entity14 increased the number of those			0
' we can report that if you are a man with sleep apnoea and erectile dysfunction you 're better of being treated for sleep apnoea than using drugs to treat the erectile dysfunction , but for some men it does n't necessarily work			2
men receiving @entity14 reported an improvement in their ' overall sexual satisfaction ' and more erections during their sleep the study 's leader said men receiving @entity14 reported an improvement in their ' overall sexual satisfaction ' and more erections during their sleep ' that 's because there a lot of things that can be attributed to erectile dysfunction and for those guys , drugs do work			1
but even so , there are advantages in treating the sleep apnoea			0
' dr @entity15 said that she hopes the results of her study , which will be revealed at the 26th annual @entity93 in @entity94 this week , will encourage and motivate men to treat their sleeping disorders			0
