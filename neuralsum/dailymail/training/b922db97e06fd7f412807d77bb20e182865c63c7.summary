by @entity1 reporter published : 14:53 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 05:19 est , 25 april 2013 scientists have described the new bird flu that has killed 22 people in @entity5 as one of the most deadly influenza strains as it spreads to @entity8			1
the @entity10 flu has infected 108 people in @entity5 since it was first detected in march , according to the @entity13 - based @entity12			1
some 6,000 @entity5 tourists visit @entity8 every day , putting pressure on @entity8 authorities to step up their screening at airports to contain the virus			1
the strain appears to spread more easily to humans than @entity22 , a virus that caused panic when it started killing people in @entity26 a decade ago			2
deadly : a worker hanging chickens in the slaughter house of @entity30 , the day after @entity8 reported its first case of the bird flu infection precautions : @entity8 airlines will suspend chicken and ducks that come from @entity5 anxiety : commuters wear masks at a subway station in @entity41 , @entity8 in the hope of protecting themselves scientists are concerned as it transmits more easily from birds to humans than another strain that has killed hundreds since 2003			1
@entity8 's @entity49 said a 53 - year - old businessman had contracted @entity10 while travelling in @entity5 and was in a serious condition in hospital			1
although it is not clear exactly how people are being infected , experts say they see no evidence so far of the most worrisome scenario - sustained transmission between people			2
an international team of scientists led by the @entity12 and the @entity5 government conducted a five - day investigation in @entity5 , but said they were no closer to determining whether the virus might become transmissible between people			1
' the situation remains complex and difficult and evolving , ' said @entity67 , the @entity12 's assistant director - general for health security			0
' when we look at influenza viruses , this is an unusually dangerous virus for humans , ' he said at a briefing			0

' scientists who have analysed genetic sequence data from samples from three @entity10 victims say the strain is a so - called ' triple reassortant ' virus with a mixture of genes from three other flu strains found in birds in @entity26			2
' complex and difficult ' : @entity67 , the @entity12 's assistant director - general for health security speaks during a press conference in @entity90 recent pandemic viruses , including the @entity119 ' swine flu ' of 2009/2010 , have been mixtures of mammal and bird flu - hybrids that are more likely to be milder because mammalian flu tends to make people less severely ill than bird flu			0
pure bird flu strains , such as the new @entity10 strain and the h5n1 flu , which has killed about 371 of 622 the people it has infected since 2003 , are generally more deadly for people			1
the team of experts , who began their investigation in @entity5 last week , said one problem in tracking @entity10 is the absence of visible illness in poultry			2
@entity67 stressed that the team is still at the beginning of its investigation , and said that ' we may just be seeing the most serious infections ' at this point			0
based on the evidence , ' this virus is more easily transmissible from poultry to humans than @entity95 ' , he said			0
besides the initial cases of @entity10 in and around @entity151 , others have been detected in @entity90 and five provinces			0
samples from chickens , ducks and pigeons from poultry markets have tested positive for @entity10 , but those from migratory birds have not , suggesting that ' the likely source of infection is poultry ' , said @entity162 , director of the influenza division at the @entity164			0
@entity165 , a flu virologist at @entity167 , said the emergence of human @entity10 infections - a completely new strain in people - was ' very , very unsettling '			1
' this virus seems to have been quietly spreading in chickens without anyone knowing about it , ' he told @entity175 in @entity176			0
flu experts say it is likely that more cases of human infection with @entity10 flu will emerge in the coming weeks and months , at least until the source of infection has been completely confirmed and effectively controlled			2

scientists are concerned that the new strain appears to pass more easily from bird to human widespread problem : a farmer puts baskets of newly hatched ducklings in a hatch room at a poultry egg trading market in @entity197 , @entity198 , in @entity5 's @entity200 province @entity201 , the @entity202 - based director of the @entity203 on @entity204 said there has been a ' dramatic slowdown of cases ' in the commercial capital of @entity151 , which has recorded most of the deaths , something she described as ' encouraging '			1
after @entity151 closed down its live poultry markets in early april , there was an almost immediate decline in new @entity10 cases , she said			0
' the evidence suggests that the closing of the live poultry markets was an effective way to reduce the risks			0
' even so , the @entity12 's @entity5 representative , @entity220 , issued figures last week showing that half of the patients analysed had no known contact with poultry .			0
