curbing immigration to @entity2 would be a ' disaster ' , @entity0 has claimed in a warning against @entity5 copying @entity7 policies			1
the former prime minister said @entity5 must be ' really careful ' of saying things that suggested @entity11 's party is justified in its policies			1
the intervention comes as @entity14 faces the prospect of @entity5 being defeated by @entity7 in the election of a new police and crime commissioner in @entity19			1
recent polls have put @entity7 on as much as 19 per cent , with @entity5 neck and neck with the @entity32			1
some senior @entity5 figures , including rising star @entity34 , have launched strongly - worded attacks on the ' absolutely vile ' views of ' racists ' in @entity7			1
however , mr @entity14 has come under pressure to take a tougher stance on immigration and @entity41 to prevent the loss of working class voters			1
last week he announced that a @entity5 government would immediately bring in an @entity45 and said the @entity47 ' needs to change if we are to deal with the problems of immigration '			2
but mr @entity0 insisted @entity5 should focus on its own values and not appear to lend credibility to @entity7 's policies on halting immigration and leaving the @entity47			1
he said the way to tackle the threat from @entity7 was to ' deal with it by what you believe '			1
labour leader @entity14 ( right ) is urged not to try to copy the policies of @entity7 leader @entity11 ( left ) @entity7 has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a @entity65 telephone poll in june he told @entity67 magazine : ' let 's be clear : we do n't think that @entity7 's right , not on immigration and not on @entity41 - so the first thing you 've got to be really careful of doing is ... saying things that suggest that they 're kind of justified in their policy because what you 're actually going to do is validate their argument when in fact you do n't believe in it			1
' stopping immigration would be ' a disaster for this country ' , he said			2
@entity5 must not ' end up chasing after the policies of a party like @entity7 , who you do n't agree with , whose policies would take this country backwards economically , politically , in every conceivable way , and who , ultimately , at the heart of what they do , have a rather nasty core of prejudice that none of us believe in , which you 've actually got to take on and fight			1
so the way to deal with this is to deal with it by what you believe '			0
mr @entity0 claimed the way @entity102 is dealing with the threat from @entity7 ' does n't do them any electoral favours at all '			1
he claimed the @entity32 would be better off at the ballot box ' if they actually stood up against these people and said ' you do n't understand the way the world works today , your policies will take us backwards and we 're not going there '			2
' mr @entity0 added : ' there 's a huge desire in a large part of the media in this country to return @entity2 politics to a traditional @entity120 party fighting a traditional @entity5			1
' that would lead to a ' traditional result ' , he warned			0
@entity14 is facing a battle to hold off @entity7 in his own back yard today – as voters go to the polls in @entity19 to elect a new police commissioner			1
a defeat for @entity5 would be seen as a major blow for mr @entity14 whose @entity131 constituency lies in the @entity19 police force area			1
today ’s contest was sparked by the resignation of @entity5 ’s previous police commissioner @entity135 – who stood down in the wake of the @entity138 child sex abuse scandal , where an estimated 1,400 children were abused over 16 years by @entity141 gangs			0
labour leader @entity14 is facing a fight to hold off the growing @entity7 threat in the party 's heartlands @entity7 has exploited the child abuse scandal to attack @entity5			1
last week , the party launched a poster featuring a young woman with the slogan : ‘ there are 1,400 reasons why you should not trust @entity5 again ’			2
@entity11 told @entity154 the election was be close – despite his party finishing a distant fourth in the 2012 contest			1
he said : ‘ it will be nip and tuck			0
we definitely feel that if we win this it will add fuel to the fire that from @entity165 northwards , if you vote @entity120 you get @entity5			0
’ mr @entity11 hopes it can keep its current momentum going by securing the @entity170 post following its recent by - election success in @entity173			2
voters are going to the polls across the @entity176 , @entity138 , @entity177 and @entity131 - but the turnout is expected to barely top 10 per cent amid widespread disinterest			0
@entity7 ’s candidate for the position is the retired police officer @entity180			2
@entity5 has chosen retired @entity183 priest @entity182 as its candidate – in a bid to distance itself from the @entity138 scandal			0
a lone voter enters an empty polling station on @entity189 , @entity138 today , which had seen only nine voters by 10.30am an empty polling station in @entity192 , @entity138 today , which had seen less than five voters by 10.30am an empty mobile library being used as a polling station on @entity196 , @entity138 today , which had seen only two voters by 11am there will be almost as much interest in how many of the 1,010,599 electorate bother to cast their votes as there will be on which of the four candidates wins when the by - election result is announced in @entity177 tomorrow			0
mr @entity135 's initial refusal to step down highlighted the fact that there was no way to get rid of a @entity211 unless they had committed an offence			2
the saga surrounding his future further undermined confidence in the new @entity211 system , which had been dented first by the record low turnouts in 2012 , and provoked furious calls for the law to be changed or the post to be simply abolished			0
the @entity223 have branded the coalition experiment with directly - elected commissioners a failure and pledged to scrap them			0
the party decided not to field a candidate in the by - election for this reason @entity5 has declared it is committed to scrapping them if it wins power in 2015			2
@entity7 leader @entity11 with the party 's candidate for the position of @entity19 police and crime commissioner @entity180 ( right ) mr @entity135 only resigned after weeks of pressure following the @entity240 which revealed how more than 1,400 children had been exploited by gangs of men in @entity138			1
he was the councillor who oversaw children 's services in the town between 2005 and 2010			0
but @entity5 's campaign to retain the post has been hampered by the controversy in @entity138			0
mr @entity11 has insisted @entity7 can build the party 's recent by - election victory in @entity173 and close second in @entity26 and @entity27 by getting its first @entity211 elected			1
and his confidence has also been supported by strong @entity7 showings in @entity138 's council elections this year and in the @entity41 elections in parts of @entity19			1
but @entity7 only came fourth when mr @entity135 was elected in 2012			2
the @entity258 , came second two years ago and they believe they will still be the biggest rivals to labour today 's poll			0
former police officer @entity180 hopes to replace former @entity5 police commissioner @entity135 who stood down in the wake of @entity138 child sexual exploitation scandal @entity7 has exploited the @entity138 child abuse scandal - where 1,400 children were abused - to attack @entity5 @entity265 @entity264 chairman @entity263 said his party has a high profile in @entity19 in the wake of it winning the @entity131 mayoral election in 2009 and pushing @entity5 hard in 2012			1
four candidates have declared for the by - election : @entity273 ( @entity265 @entity258 ) , @entity182 ( @entity5 ) , @entity180 ( @entity7 ) , @entity274 ( conservatives )			2
mr @entity273 came second to mr @entity135 in the 2012 election			0
