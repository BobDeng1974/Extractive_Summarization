@entity0 has set his sights on cracking the £ 3million prizemoney barrier for the third time in his career after revealing he expects many of his big names to be in action at next month ’s @entity8 meeting at @entity9			1
@entity0 will run some of his biggest names at next month 's @entity12 meeting at @entity9 the man who has his ninth trainer ’s title as good as in the bag also revealed he is likely to have more runners during the summer months in an attempt kick - start stable jockey @entity18 ’ title challenge in the @entity22 era			1
definitely not heading to @entity9 are @entity25 winner @entity23 and @entity28 victor @entity26 , who have run their last races of the season			2
but @entity9 - bound are @entity32 , a disappointing seventh beind @entity34 in the @entity35 , as well as @entity37 second and third @entity38 and @entity39 , with the latter possibly reverting back to steeplechasing			1
@entity0 ’ @entity8 challenge is headed by @entity43 and @entity44 , whose @entity46 third when trying to give weight to @entity35 winner @entity48 at @entity49 last month now looks a fair effort			1
@entity0 , whose double at @entity52 on saturday following his three successes at the @entity54 took him to 97 winners and £ 2.63million for the campaign , said : ‘ i love going to @entity9 and the aim is to crack the £ 3m in prizemoney			1
there is a long way to go in the season yet			0
it would be nice to do that			0
‘ but there are a lot of horses i will finish now and save for next year			0
we want to help @entity18 be champion jockey			0
anything a bit below top class could run on through the summer to try to get him as many winners before we properly get going			2
@entity32 ( right ) , a disapponting seventh in the @entity75 , will line up at @entity9 ‘ last year we had a very slow start and @entity18 only had five winners for us by october			2
’ whether @entity32 runs in another @entity35 has yet to be decided but after a third defeat in the race , @entity0 knows his priority with the gelding will be trying to win a third @entity82 at @entity52 on @entity83			1
@entity0 , who revealed @entity85 runner - up @entity86 has underone an operation to prevent infection in the bad leg cut he picked up during the race , added : ’ the plan with @entity32 will be @entity9 if he is alright			1
he likes it there and i have to accept now he is better on a flat track			0
@entity37 second place - getter @entity38 ( pictured ) and stablemate @entity96 will also run ‘ @entity99 ( @entity98 ) said he did n’t travel well throughout the @entity35 although watching , it looked like he did			1
i think @entity48 got a lot of them out of their comfort zone			0
it is what @entity105 used to do to them			0
’ ‘ we will have to think about what to do but next season will be built around the @entity111 and @entity82 without a shadow of a doubt			0
’ meanwhile , although @entity115 - trained @entity114 has run his last race of the season , younger brother @entity117 could represent the family in the three - mile novices ’ hurdle at the @entity8 meeting			2

@entity0 could *hit* £ 3million prizemoney barrier for the third time
@entity32 , @entity38 and @entity96 set to run at @entity9
@entity0 ’ @entity8 challenge headed by @entity43 and @entity44
