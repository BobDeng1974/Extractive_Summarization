by @entity1 correspondent published : 06:05 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 13 march 2013 as views from the office go , it could be one of the best in the world			2
scientists working on the world 's largest telescope today showed off their workplace - deep in the @entity12 desert , in one of the driest places on @entity15			1
however , at an altitude of 16,400ft , roughly half the cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times the height of @entity19 , they did admit to some problems - having to carry oxygen to work , for example			1
it is also the highest on the planet and , at almost £ 1billion , the most expensive of its kind			0
it is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed			0
built deep in the @entity12 desert , in one of the driest places on @entity15 , @entity28 is at an altitude of 16,400ft – roughly half the cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times the height of @entity19			1
but while the site promises good scientific results , the setting on the edge of the @entity58 poses difficulties for those who work there			0
to keep altitude sickness at bay , as much work as possible is done at a control centre on lower ground			0
visits to the telescope site are kept as short as possible and workers carry oxygen tanks			0
a member of the media takes pictures of the series of parabolic antennas of the @entity28 project at the @entity79 in the @entity81 desert , some 1074 miles north of @entity82 and 5000 metres above sea level the @entity12 desert was chosen because it is one of the few places in the world where it is still possible to find a high , dry location unaffected by pollution from artificial light rather than one single telescope , it is made up of 66 giant antennae which gather faint radio waves from space for processing by a supercomputer			1
costing £ 950million to build , including around £ 65million from the @entity98 , and billed as being ‘ in search of our cosmic origins ’ , it is hoped it will provide answers as to where the stars , the planets , and , ultimately where we came from			0
by collecting radio waves rather than optical light , @entity28 can look through the dense dust clouds of deep space			1
this will give astronomers a glimpse of galaxies from just after the @entity117			0
it can also look at how individual stars and planets are formed			0
this could shine a light on our creation as it is believed the elements spewed out by dying stars went on the seed the sun , the planets and , eventually , humans			2
it will also tell us more about where life came from by finding traces of compounds from water to chemicals similar those in @entity138			0
@entity139 , of the @entity140 and @entity28 ’s @entity98 project manager , said : ‘ it is said we are all made of stardust			1
the telescope , which was part - built by @entity98 companies , has yet to run at full power @entity28 is located 5,000 meters above @entity147 plateau , some 50 km of @entity81 in @entity148 , in @entity149 built deep in the @entity12 desert , in one of the driest places on @entity15 , @entity28 is at an altitude of 16,400ft ¿ roughly half the cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times the height of @entity19 ‘ @entity28 will answer certain questions about where we came from			1
’ the telescope , which was part - built by @entity98 companies , has yet to run at full power			0
but when all the dishes are operating in unison , the resulting images should be ten times sharper than those of the @entity167 space telescope			1
ten times sharper than @entity168 some of the @entity28 antennae bathed in red light			1
in the background there is the southern @entity173 on the left and the @entity175 at the top to get such pictures from a single land - based radio telescope , it would have to be ten miles wide			2
the @entity12 desert was chosen because it is one of the few places in the world where it is still possible to find a high , dry location unaffected by pollution from artificial light			1
dryness is particularly important as moisture in the air absorbs the radio waves the dishes are trying to capture			1
@entity192 , one of the @entity193 , has captured the antennas of the @entity38 ( @entity28 ) under the southern sky in another breathtaking image under test : a spectacular sunset view of three prototypes of @entity28 antennas , developed by @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 , respectively , at the @entity204 ( @entity205 ) in @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 but while the site promises good scientific results , the setting on the edge of the @entity58 poses difficulties for those who work there			1
to keep altitude sickness at bay , as much work as possible is done at a control centre on lower ground			0
visits to the telescope site are kept as short as possible and workers carry oxygen tanks			0
a spokesman for the @entity226 , which co-ordinates the @entity203 investment , said : ‘ @entity28 contributes profoundly to the satisfaction of curiosity , not just of the professional researcher , but of the child who looks at the sky full of stars and wonders what they are and what part of the universe we occupy			1
’ dryness is particularly important as moisture in the air absorbs the radio waves the dishes are trying to capture radio telescope antennas of the @entity28 ) project , in the @entity81 desert , some 1500 km north of @entity82 , on march 12,2013 the secret to the £ 1 billion facility 's incredible resolution comes from two factors : height and distance			1
@entity28 's highest receivers sit on a plateau some 16,500 feet ( 5,000 meters ) above sea level			2
this is far above most of @entity15 's atmosphere and water vapor , which obscures observations			0
astronomers working in @entity28 's facility at 9,500 feet ( 2,900 meters ) must use supplemental oxygen for extended stays			2
the system currently comprises about 50 functional antennas			0
when the array is finished , there will be 66 of these receivers that can be moved as far as 9.9 miles ( 16 kilometers ) apart			2
the antennas capture astronomical signals from the sky individually , then combine their results in a supercomputer to get precise information about where the signals come from			2
researchers say it is similar to how we use our two ears to locate sounds around us , but on a universe - size scale			0
this high resolution not only lets @entity28 observe young planetary systems , but also pin down hydrogen and other life - building blocks in gas clouds			1
the array can also track the evolution of galaxies .			0

@entity28 is situated in the @entity12 desert at 16,400ft – roughly half the cruising height of a jumbo jet and almost four times higher than @entity19
made up of 66 giant antennae which gather faint radio waves from space for processing by a supercomputer
