your questions , ' and we want to open up the doors and let our customers ask us any questions they have , and give them answers , ' said company director of quality systems @entity80 to @entity47			0
mixture : a @entity0 's representative has said this meat ' is what we call beef trim , and it comes from familiar cuts that you may know , like chuck and round and sirloin ' not the finished product ! meat that has not yet been ground into patties is seen on a factory conveyor belt transformation : @entity0 's meat goes through a grinder @entity39 ( pictured center ) , from tv show mythbusters , went behind the scenes at the meat plant with staff while the nation has long wondered about the mass production of so much food in @entity108 's 35,000 locations worldwide , the company has decided to finally provide the answers or proof for the doubters			1

for its latest campaign , among the first issues @entity0 's addresses are widely circulated online images and videos that show its burgers staying in tact after several weeks or even years			1

as a result , some people have suggested our food contains rubber or plastic , or that the ingredient is unsafe			0
it 's simply not the case			0
think of salt : the salt you use in your food at home is a variation of the salt you may use to de-ice your sidewalk			0
the same is true of @entity254 â€” it can be used in different ways			0
