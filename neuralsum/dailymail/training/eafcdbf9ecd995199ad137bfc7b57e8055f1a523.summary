click here to view all the stats and graphics from @entity4 's shock win against @entity5 using our fantastic match zone service this could well turn out to be the best night of @entity10 's season so far , which is pretty odd given that they were n't playing			1
here at the @entity16 that will host sunday 's @entity18 derby , @entity10 's neighbours and modern superiors managed to extend their winless run to three games			1
by their current standards , that represents a slump for @entity5			1
worse than that , @entity5 lost their playmaker @entity26 to a knee injury			2
scroll down to see the big match stats from @entity5 vs @entity4 @entity4 knocked @entity5 out of the @entity29 after goals from @entity31 and @entity32 ( above ) @entity4 celebrate as the @entity33 went on to record their first ever victory over @entity5 at the @entity16 on wednesday @entity31 beats @entity35 to the ball and slots past @entity38 to put @entity4 into a shock lead at @entity5 @entity31 ( left ) is just 18 years old but stunned the home crowd after netting in the first few minutes at the @entity16 @entity4 boss @entity41 congratulates the starlet after his strike early on in the first half @entity32 pokes the ball past @entity38 once again to all but seal a famous win for @entity4 at the @entity16 @entity32 celebrates scoring @entity4 's second goal and securing the @entity33 ' place in the quarter - finals of the @entity29 @entity50 and @entity51 look deflated at the restart as the holders were eventually dumped out of the @entity29 @entity4 fans perform the ' @entity55 ' to mock the @entity5 supporters after their side go 2 - 0 up - with @entity58 watching on @entity5 : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity58 5.5 ; @entity59 6 , @entity60 6 , @entity35 5.5 , @entity61 6 ; @entity62 5.5 , @entity63 6 ( @entity64 6 ) ; @entity65 6.5 , @entity66 5.5 , @entity26 6 ( @entity67 8mins 7 ( @entity50 69mins 6 ) ) ; @entity51 5.5 subs not used : @entity70 , @entity69 , @entity71 , @entity72			1

goals : @entity31 5 , @entity32 75 booked : @entity76 referee : @entity91 5 @entity92 : @entity80 city manager @entity94 's tactic of fielding strong teams in the competition that gave him his first @entity99 trophy last season is generally admirable			1
on wednesday night , though , it began to look a little reckless as @entity26 limped off after five minutes with a knee problem and @entity63 exited on the hour with a tight groin			2
@entity94 admitted this week that he smiled when @entity10 's @entity105 scored an equaliser against @entity107 in the @entity108 at the weekend			0
well , now it was @entity111 's turn			0
the @entity10 manager will head east across town on sunday with more confidence than previously he might			0
certainly @entity5 were poor against an admirably ambitious @entity4 side			1
young forward @entity31 scored the first goal in just the sixth minute and there could have been a couple more before substitute @entity32 shimmied through for one of the goals of the season with 15 minutes left			1
@entity94 continues to do his best to appear sanguine			0
his team , he says , are no better or worse than they were this time last season			0
the statistics , though , are unpleasant			0
not only have @entity5 won just six of their fifteen games in all competitions this season , they are now on a three - match winless run for the second time in a season that is less than three months old			1
to place this in proper context , this did n't happen at all last season			0
indeed the last time it did prior to this campaign was february 2013			0
so what does this all add up to ? a heap of bad news and bad omens ahead of sunday , that 's for sure			2
in all likelihood , @entity108 leaders @entity107 will be nine points clear of @entity5 by the time the derby commences and @entity94 can only hope improvement arrives quickly			1
@entity5 's @entity152 playmaker @entity26 was forced off after picking up an early injury at the @entity16 @entity26 is now a doubt for this weekend 's derby against @entity5 after sustaining the knock @entity31 was a tricky character to deal with all evening , even for experienced full - back @entity59 @entity5 have failed to win their last three matches and face @entity10 in the club 's next @entity108 fixture ... last three results @entity164 ( a ) , @entity163 , drew 2 - 2 @entity165 ( a ) , @entity108 , lost 2 - 1 @entity4 ( @entity166 ) , @entity29 , lost 2 - 0 next three fixtures @entity10 ( @entity166 ) , @entity108 , ( @entity166 ) - sunday , november 2 @entity164 ( @entity166 ) , @entity163 , ( @entity166 ) - wednesday , november 5 @entity168 ( a ) , @entity108 , saturday , november 8 @entity35 hauls down @entity4 's @entity76 in the box - further proof for @entity170 's @entity172 campaign evidence at last , perhaps , that even the most determined grapple tackle does n’t always work			1
with just over half an hour gone , @entity5 ’s burly central defender @entity35 had @entity76 virtually in a headlock as a corner came in			1
referee @entity91 and his assistants missed the offence — goodness knows how — but @entity76 managed to get off the floor in time to volley a shot in to goalkeeper @entity38 ’s shins			1
if @entity5 were a little unfortunate to lose at @entity165 last weekend , they were not here			2
against a @entity4 team that had n't beaten them in 17 attempts and that contained six new players following sunday 's surprise win at @entity188 , they were pretty wretched in all areas of the field and could really have lost by more			1
@entity4 were brave and progressive but still limited			2
they played very well and it is hard not to feel pleased for manager @entity41 given all he has been through in recent times			0
@entity5 , though , began badly , gifted @entity4 a goal and never really recovered			1
only a minute or so had passed following @entity26 's injury – caused accidentally by @entity4 's @entity80 – when @entity5 midfielder @entity62 gave the ball away in midfield and @entity197 under 20 star @entity31 raced clear to slide a shot between the legs of reserve goalkeeper @entity38			1
@entity58 could have done better			0
he looked indecisive as @entity31 advanced			2
the mistake was @entity62 's , though			0
the @entity202 did the same thing in the @entity205 semi-final against @entity206			0
this time the stakes were rather lower but the error just as rudimentary			0
@entity5 did manage to rouse themselves a little and played some relatively progressive football as they chased the game			2
there were two chances for @entity66 in the first half while @entity4 defender @entity75 sliced a clearance against his own post			2
@entity4 , though , should have been at least one more goal better off by half - time			1
@entity76 volleyed a chance from a corner against @entity58 's legs just after the half hour while young centre forward @entity83 almost slid a @entity74 cross in at the near post in the 45th minute			1
in to the second half and @entity4 for a time looked as though they would be undone by poor decisions by referee @entity91			2
due to return to the @entity108 after a two year absence this weekend , @entity91 will hope to have a better game than he did here			0
his decision not to award @entity4 a penalty when @entity61 scythed down the breaking @entity79 in the 68th minute represented as big a blunder as anything committed by those in sky blue			2
@entity61 should have been sent off , too , and these injustices could have derailed @entity4 as @entity94 threw on @entity50 and chased the game hard			2
as it was , @entity32 wrapped up his team 's unlikely victory in the 75th minute , throwing the hapless @entity62 an outrageous dummy on the edge of the penalty area , surging past @entity59 and beating @entity58 across his body with a toe poke in to the far corner			1
@entity75 goes in hard on @entity5 substitute @entity67 , who featured for the first time since his injury @entity32 sealed the win after storming past the @entity5 defence , check out the stats from the game using our fantastic match zone service @entity77 storms away from the hosts ' midfielder @entity62 on wednesday night @entity188 vs @entity4 derby vs @entity107 @entity256 vs @entity257 @entity258 vs @entity259 it was a superb goal that capped @entity4 's wonderful night			1
@entity261 went close at the death but by then it all looked a bit desperate			0
in truth , they perhaps did themselves a favour			0
extra-time would have done them no good at all			0
' we are not playing well , we are in a difficult moment with a lack of trust , ' said @entity94 afterwards			0
' we conceded two easy goals			0
there is a lack of confidence which we must change as soon as possible			0
' we are not playing as fast as we can , as freely as a team			0
i am worried about how we are playing but we can improve			0
' with a @entity18 derby looming , @entity94 must hope he is right			1
@entity79 felt he should have had a penalty when he was brought down by @entity61 @entity79 unleashes a shot towards goal as @entity4 looked to build on their lead after the break the in - form @entity288 striker @entity50 was rested as @entity5 took on struggling @entity4 on wednesday night @entity80 came through his first competitive game in almost two years on wednesday night @entity35 watches on after his error allowed @entity32 to score as @entity33 supporters do the ' @entity55 ' - a favourite celebration of @entity5 fans @entity41 's buoyant players celebrate in front of thousands of the travelling supporters down from the @entity298			1

@entity4 throught to the quarter - finals of the @entity29 after shock victory at the @entity16
@entity31 opened the scoring , slotting past @entity38 after just six minutes
@entity32 made it 2 - 0 and the visiting fans then performed the ' @entity55 ' in the crowd
@entity5 have n't won in three games and face rivals *united* in the @entity18 derby on sunday
@entity35 tugs @entity76 in the box to provide case for @entity170 's @entity172 campaign
