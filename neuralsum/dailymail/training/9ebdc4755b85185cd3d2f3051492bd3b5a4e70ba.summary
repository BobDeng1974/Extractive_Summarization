the books are so old that the only safe way to clean them is with a vacuum cleaner			2
so each volume in the 40,000 - strong library at @entity6 has to be taken down from the shelves and thoroughly dusted down in a process that can take anything up to 15 minutes per book – and years for the whole collection			1
but staff at the @entity14 ’s home in @entity15 are n’t using the family @entity16 for this spring clean			1
careful clean : a team of workers with mini-vacuums are cleaning the 40,000 books accumulated over 500 years in the 7 libraries of @entity6 in @entity15 they ’ve been given small hand vacuums that are delicate enough not to damage the books – some of which date back 500 years			1
the entire process takes years to complete and so staff at @entity6 near @entity28 , have divided it up into sections			2
they started by slowly sucking the dust from the pages of the 4,500 books in the @entity35 and have now moved on to the @entity36 , where there are 3,000 books			2
each one takes between three and five minutes to clean depending on age , size , and how delicate it is			2
the group is focusing on the shelves nearest to the visitors ’ areas because crowds walking past have created more dust			0
arduous task : it takes two teams of four staff 3 - 15 minutes to delicately hoover the dust from each book using specially adapted low suction vacuum cleaners the first library at @entity6 dates back to the 16th century when the house was built by sir @entity59 and some of his books still feature in the enormous collection			1
the oldest tome at the house dates back to 1470 and there around around 130 others printed before 1500			1
other fascinating books include @entity68 ’s @entity67 and the earliest @entity70 cookbook , the ‘ @entity72 ’ printed by @entity71 in 1500			0
@entity73 , assistant librarian said : ‘ we concentrate on the books which are closest to where visitors walk as this creates more dust			0
slow progress : staff started with the 4,500 books in the @entity35 and have now moved on to the @entity36 , where there are 3,000 books ‘ we use special , low - suction vacuum cleaners and it takes between three and fifteen minutes to clean each book depending on age , size and how delicate it is			1
‘ some exceptionally large and dirty books take longer			0
‘ i ’d say the key requirements are concentration , attention to detail , and diligence , as well as knowing how to clean the books in a particular way			0
‘ the main feature of the vacuum cleaners is that they have sensitive suction levels , if they were any stronger the books could be damaged			0
‘ they also have the technology to stop any mildew spores that are sucked into the vacuum from getting back out and spread around			0

staff at the home of @entity14 to vacuum 40,000 books
takes eight staff 3 - 15 minutes to hoover the dust from each book
the oldest book at @entity6 dates back to 1470
