@entity1 fans have claimed that they are being ripped off after first @entity2 and then @entity3 hiked ticket prices for their @entity6 clashes with the @entity8 giants			1
@entity10 's side will travel to the @entity11 to face the @entity13 minnows in a fourth round clash on january 23 and away supporters have hit out after being charged £ 30			1
although that figure is considerably less than admission at most @entity8 clubs furious @entity3 followers point out that fans of @entity24 , @entity21 's opponents in the third round , paid £ 19			1
@entity1 fans have reacted angrily after finding out their clash at @entity21 will cost £ 30 for a ticket the view of the terrace at the @entity11 which will be packed to the rafters ... but it will cost @entity3 fans more to attend than it did @entity24 in the third round they are also seething about their own third round trip to @entity32			1
tickets there were also priced at £ 30 – double the £ 15 @entity36 fans had been asked to pay in the @entity37			1
one @entity3 fan , @ fergusmufc , took to @entity40 to vent his frustrations			0
he tweeted : ' i see the magic of the cup means @entity21 can increase they 're ( sic ) ticket prices by over 50 % like @entity46 and no one says a word			2
' ' in the grand scheme of what we are charged week in week out £ 30 is n't the worse but it 's the principal of the increase			1
' the tunnel where the @entity21 and @entity1 players will line up prior to the @entity6 fourth round the @entity11 - home of @entity13 side @entity3 , who will host @entity3 @entity60 , from fans group @entity59 , pointed out that the match would cause a transport nightmare for @entity3 supporters			1
' we often hear the @entity6 referring to the magic of the @entity6 , ' he said			0
' that magic is created not just by the teams competing but by the fans			0
scheduling the game for a friday night with such away travel issues is not good for travelling fans			0
to add insult to that , @entity21 have followed @entity46 and increased their admission prices for the tie by over 50 %			2
' once again profit comes before the fans			0
with these clubs trying to scrape every last penny from supporters			0
@entity21 stand to have a massive windfall from a full house and extra tv and commercial revenue , not to mention increased exposure			0
' it 's disappointing that once again fans will have to pay extra to experience this so - called cup magic			2
' earlier this month @entity90 refused to cash in on their dream @entity6 tie against @entity93 with a decision taken to fix ticket prices at @entity13 levels , between £ 4 and £ 25			0
@entity3 could not be reached for comment			0
as at @entity46 , home supporters are also being charged extra , with adult main stand tickets priced at £ 18 for league matches , up to £ 35 for the @entity3 match , and tickets in other sections rising from £ 16 to £ 30			1
@entity105 / @entity104 vs @entity106 @entity21 vs @entity1 @entity107 vs @entity108 @entity109 vs @entity111 / @entity110 derby vs @entity114 / @entity113 @entity115 vs @entity116 @entity117 vs @entity118 @entity119 vs @entity120 @entity121 vs @entity122 @entity93 vs @entity123 @entity125 / @entity124 vs @entity126 @entity127 vs @entity128 @entity129 vs @entity130 @entity131 vs @entity133 / @entity132 @entity134 / @entity135 vs @entity137 / @entity136 @entity138 vs @entity139 ties to be played across the weekend of january 24 and 25			2

@entity1 fans are being charged £ 30 for their trip to @entity21
in the third round , @entity21 's opponents were only charged £ 19 a ticket
in @entity3 's tie against @entity46 , fans again had to pay £ 30 to attend the game
but in the second round , @entity46 's opponents were charged £ 15 for a ticket
*united* fans feel it is *unfair* that they should be charged more to attend , for being a @entity8 club
