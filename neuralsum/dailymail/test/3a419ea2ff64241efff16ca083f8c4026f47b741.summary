a 19 - year - old model in @entity1 has taken to bathing in pig 's blood in a desperate – and bizarre – attempt to maintain her youthful appearance – despite the fact that she is a vegetarian			1
in the latest episode of @entity13 's @entity12 , entitled ' i 'm obsessed with @entity15 ' , freelance model @entity9 details her unique skincare method , which she tries to justify by claiming that ' thousands of years ago people did this and it worked '			1
' my greatest fear is getting old and developing wrinkles and extra loose skin , ' @entity9 says			1
' so to prevent that from happening i must do whatever it takes			0
her desperation to remain looking as young as possible for as long as possible has driven @entity9 to a number of extraordinary lengths , most notably covering her body in animal blood , a process she insists will ' keep the skin looking soft and tight '			1
her family , skeptical of the benefits ask for proof , but @entity9 is unable to offer anything which backs up her bizarre claims			2
the model also shows off a myriad of other ' beauty fixes ' she uses , including a daily shot of garlic powder , balsamic vinaigrette , sage , and olive oil - which she claims helps to ' preserve your body ' - as well as a skincare regimen that involves washing her face eight to ten times per day			1
she also claims to have eaten placenta , gone on fasts and put her body through many detoxes in her quest to stay young			0
in the thick of it : @entity9 seems unperturbed by the process , dunking her hand into the container of blood and examining the contents before pouring it on to herself bloody bizarre : the teenager picked up the blood at a local butcher who asked her if she would prefer pork or beef , to which she replies , ' i do n't eat meat ' the teen 's grandmother , @entity92 , tries her best to dissuade @entity9 of her latest endeavor , saying she could be risking her well being			1
' i 'm sorry my grandmother is worried about my health , ' says @entity9			2
' but now that i 'm this close to my blood bath , i ca n't stop			0
' after picking up the pig 's blood from a butcher in a large bucket , @entity9 climbs into the tub wearing only her underwear and begins pouring the thick , red liquid all over her body			2
the model , who claims to be a vegetarian , describes how ' even the roughest parts of the body like the elbows feel soft , and i think i owe that to the blood '			0
later in the episode , @entity9 claims that though she believes the blood bath helped her self - esteem , she ' has no desire to do it again '			1
luckily for @entity9 , the experience of filming with @entity13 seems to have had a positive outcome			1
as she reveals in a follow up q&a with the channel , she was ' humbled ' by the reactions she received			0
' i never believed i was that off my rocker , ' she adds			0
' i think i owe that to the blood ' : the teenager describes feeling her skin become softer as she soaks in the blood other blood bathers : the infamous countess @entity135 was said to have bathed in the blood of virgins to stay young , and the benefits of its use are still championed today by the likes of @entity142 although the benefits are not proven , the concept of using blood as a beauty product is far from new			2
the idea of bathing in blood for youth may have originated with the story of @entity135 , a @entity152 countess who was alleged to have murdered hundreds of young women around the turn of the 16th century			0
folklore says that she bathed in the blood of virgins to maintain her youth			0
fast - forward to more recent - and less murderous - applications , @entity142 's ' vampire facial ' went through a surge in popularity in 2013 after the reality star posted a photo of herself receiving the treatment , which involves drawing a person 's own blood , separating the platelets and then injecting it back into the patient 's face			2
a similar new beauty craze involved using a patient 's own blood to create a beauty cream , which was recently offered to patrons at the @entity176 in @entity177 .			0

in the video she details her desperate attempts to avoid aging and *prolong* her modeling career for as long as possible
