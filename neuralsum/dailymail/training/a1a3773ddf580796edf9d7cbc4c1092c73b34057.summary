by @entity0 published : 10:17 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 19:00 est , 13 september 2013 sent home : @entity2 , 79 , broke her shin in a fall but medics failed to diagnose it because they x-rayed the wrong one before she died a pensioners admitted to hospital with a broken leg died after hospital staff x-rayed the wrong limb and sent her home			1
@entity2 , 79 , was seen by four different doctors , but all failed to notice that her healthy left leg had been x-rayed , when in fact she had broken her right leg in two places			1
the dementia sufferer died of a severe infection similar to blood poisoning caused by the break eight days later			1
her sister , @entity22 , 75 , criticised @entity23 in @entity24 yesterday after a coroner was told it was ‘ possible ’ that @entity27 would have lived had it not been for a ‘ series of mishaps and errors ’ in her care			1
‘ i ’m still very angry , ’ said mrs @entity22			0
‘ it ’s not rocket science to x-ray the correct leg			0
her right leg and foot were swollen and inflamed			0
yet no one thought to x-ray it for days			2
‘ if they had treated her properly from the start she would not have died			2
’ an inquest was told that @entity27 was admitted to hospital on november 30 last year after falling at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , where she was a resident , and injuring her right leg			2
but there was confusion over the x-ray at @entity23 because a doctor hit ‘ left ’ instead of ‘ right ’ when inputting instructions to the radiology department on a computer			0
despite the right leg being red and swollen , radiologists went ahead with x-raying the incorrect limb			0
when no break was found , @entity27 was discharged			0
however , the pensioner was re-admitted the next day in severe pain			2
she was seen by four medics , who each failed to notice that the x-ray was of the wrong leg			1
even when they realised the mistake a series of errors and poor communication between staff meant it was a further four days before @entity27 ’ right limb was x-rayed			1
it revealed she had fractured her shin and calf bone but by then she was already suffering an infection as a consequence			0
disappointing : @entity23 in @entity24 said their care ' fell below the standards we would expect ' after the inquest into ms @entity2 ' death a further delay meant she was not put on a drip to treat the problem for 24 hours			1
surgeons realised miss @entity2 needed surgery but by then she was too ill to undergo an operation			2
she died on december 8			0
dr @entity90 , a consultant at @entity23 , started an internal review after being left ‘ incredulous ’ at some of the errors in the treatment			1
he told the hearing at @entity24 coroners ’ court : ‘ it was entirely clear that there had been a series of mishaps and errors in her care			1
’ he said it was ‘ possible ’ that @entity27 would have lived had the fractures been identified sooner.recording a narrative verdict , coroner @entity104 said @entity27 died of sepsis , a severe reaction to infection , brought on by the fractures			1
she said it was not possible to say whether @entity27 would have lived had the ‘ systemic ’ errors not been made			0
the @entity114 reported yesterday that almost 13,000 patients die needlessly of sepsis each year because of delays in diagnosis or treatment , according to the @entity120			0
a spokesman for @entity122 , which runs @entity23 , said new measures had been introduced regarding x-rays ‘ to reduce the risk of this happening again ’ .			0

@entity2 , 79 , died eight days after first going to hospital in @entity24
four staff failed to diagnose broken shin because they looked at wrong one
her treatment for blood poisoning also came a day too late before she died
senior consultant admits there was ' mishaps and errors in her care '
coroner said ms @entity2 died of blood poisoning brought on by the fracture
