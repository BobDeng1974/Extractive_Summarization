@entity1 temper : @entity2 , chef at the @entity5 restaurant , called a food blogger a c * * * after he gave the restaurant three stars out of five after the starter he was served at @entity13 's @entity5 restaurant was n't to his taste , food blogger @entity10 gave his meal a run - of - the - mill three out of five rating			1
but the review - one of 12 posts on his blog called dining with @entity10 - left a bad taste in the mouth of head chef @entity2 , who took strong exception to the average rating			1
the two - star @entity26 chef took to @entity27 to launch a bizarre tirade of abuse at mr @entity10 - even suggesting that she should have had the ' balls ' to tell him he did n't like the meal while he was at the restaurant			1
mr @entity2 , a widely - regarded and highly - reviewed chef , wrote : ' @entity34 way to gain respect with chefs ... ! ! i think your a c * * * and this its personal sorry ... ! ! ' he went on to ask mr @entity10 if he had enjoyed his meal , to which he responded yes , he had			1
so @entity2 ranted : ' as a man you should say something to my face when i ask , please buy yourself a pair of balls and play with them			1
' the culinary community on @entity27 picked up on the exchange and also started abusing the blogger , who gave a glowing review to @entity53 's @entity52 gastropub			1
but mr @entity53 a two - @entity26 - starred chef , wrote : ' now your just being a c * * * ! # notwelcomeinanyrestaurantever ! # bellend seeya dickhead ' [ sic ]			0
he followed up with ' smash him in chef @entity58 ' and ' who is this guy ? ? ? what a loser ! ! '			0
@entity2 opened @entity5 in @entity63 in 2008 after moving the restaurant from @entity65 in @entity66 dining with @entity10 : @entity10 criticised the restaurant in his blog then @entity69 , another two @entity26 star chef with a restaurant in @entity71 dived in : ' heard a really good saying once , and it rings true today ! ! ! ! @ claudebosi @entity75 there is a c * * * amongst us			1
mr @entity10 deleted his account soon after			0
his blog , however , still carries the review , with the offending paragrpah reading : ' i started with crab , rose hip and crab apple sorbet , fresh walnuts			0
the crab came wrapped in breadcrumbs but they were so over cooked , it was just like a crab flavoured @entity91 crispy pancake , with the smallest dollop of puree , it 's role on the plate was irrelevant			2
' @entity2 opened @entity5 in @entity65 , @entity66 , in 2000			2
within a year he had won a @entity26 star , and in 2004 he was awarded a second			0
the restaurant closed in april 2007 as he looked to move nearer to @entity63 , with @entity2 saying : ' i 'm transferring @entity5 , not starting a new restaurant			2
the idea is to continue and build on what i have been doing			0
' the timing of the move gave @entity26 inspectors only had two weeks to visit the restaurant , meaning @entity2 lost his second star in 2008			1
in 2009 , @entity5 placed second to @entity109 in @entity110 of the @entity111			0
@entity112 that year @entity5 ' second @entity26 star was restored			0
rant : @entity53 ( left ) and @entity69 ( right ) , also holders of two @entity26 stars , joined in the @entity27 assault on mr @entity10 the exchange infuriated @entity120 food blogger and professional chef @entity121 , who blasted his fellow cooks for their outbursts			1
he wrote : ' all of you made me ashamed to be a chef last night , you made be ashamed to be on @entity27 and you have done nothing but bad for our industry			2
' yes we know a restaurant lives or dies by its reviews ... but calling a paying customer a " c * * * " on a public forum for not liking his starter ? ' if you demand the respect of your customers you are a self - important idiot who has positioned the art of cooking up there with fighting in the trenches or treating the sick			0
i do it , you do it , and my 90 - year - old nan does it			0

food blogger who gave @entity2 three out of five stars is *vilely* abused
two other *top* chefs join in with crude insults on @entity27
another professional cook blasts the trio 's *behaviour* as ' shameful '
