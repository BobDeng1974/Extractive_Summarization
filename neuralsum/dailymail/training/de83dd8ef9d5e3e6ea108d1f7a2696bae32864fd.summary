by @entity1 reporter published : 00:18 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 00:19 est , 15 august 2013 the mysterious death of famed investigative journalist @entity3 took a surprising turn this week when it was revealed that the target of his latest expose was cia director @entity8			1
@entity3 was killed in a fiery car crash in the @entity11 neighborhood of @entity12 about 4:25 a.m. on june 18 , of this year			2
witnesses described his speeding @entity15 coup as creating sparks and flames before it fish - tailed into a palm tree and exploded			0
@entity3 ' body was burned beyond recognition			0
earlier that day , @entity3 had sent an email to his editor at the website @entity24 alerting him that ' the @entity26 are interviewing my " close friends and associates			1
" perhaps if the authorities arrive " @entity31 , " er @entity32 , may be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news - gathering practices or related journalism issues			0
' mystery : the mystery behind the tragic death of journalist @entity3 continues to grow he added that ' also : i 'm onto a big story , and need to go off the radat for a bit			2
' hours later , @entity3 was dead			0
the big story he was working now appears to be about spy chief @entity8 , who has been described in secret emails from the president of @entity50 contractor @entity49 , @entity48 - and released by @entity51 - as being on a ' witch hunt ' of investigative journalists			1
@entity3 ' wife , @entity54 , revealed on @entity56 's show on @entity57 earlier this month that the story @entity3 was working on at the time of his death was about @entity8			1
the @entity50 confirmed @entity62 's claim to @entity64 @entity63 , which says that when they brought the information - as well as a leaked email from @entity49 - to @entity8 's spokesperson , he responded ' with lightning speed			1
' ' witch hunt ' : leaked emails from a @entity50 contractor claim that @entity50 chief @entity8 is going after investigative journalists inferno : skeptics are suspicious of the intensity of the flames that engulfed @entity3 ' car the night he was killed reporter @entity78 says she received two emails from the @entity50 spokesman , one acknowledging that @entity81 was working on a story about the @entity50 , and another stating that ' without commenting on information disseminated by @entity51 , any suggestion that director @entity8 has ever attempted to infringe on constitutionally - protected press freedoms is offensive and baseless			1
' @entity62 says the article about @entity8 will appear in an upcoming issue of @entity89 magazine			0
conspiracy theorists have jumped all over @entity3 ' death because he has a proven history of bringing down powerful people ( his @entity89 article about general @entity95 effectively ended the general 's career ) and a collection of secret sources within the highest levels of government			2
beyond recognition : authorities had to use dental records to identify @entity3 ' body tragic : @entity54 , widow of @entity3 , says his death is likely just a tragic accident the cryptic emails aside , skeptics have asked where was @entity3 going at 4:25 a.m. , when witnesses say he was speeding away from his house ? why would he be going so fast on a residential street ( authorities say he was traveling ' at top speed ' when he hit the tree , although that , too , has been questioned )			1
those suspicious of a coverup in @entity3 ' death even question the intensity of the fire that seemed to instantly engulf @entity3 ' car after it hit the tree			0
some have even suggested that a device was installed in @entity3 ' car that allowed someone outside of the vehicle to control it 's speed and direction - although , those claims have been widely rejected as baseless , as there 's no known evidence to suggest that anyone but @entity3 was in control of the vehicle , or that such a device even exists			0
adding to the suspicion is the fact that several government agencies - both local and federal - have been slow to turn over public records about the crash , despite hundreds of @entity144 requests from journalists across the country			0
when asked if she subscribes to any of the conspiracy theories about her husband 's untimely death , @entity62 says ' the @entity152 still has an active investigation ... my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and i 'm very unlucky and the world is very unlucky			2

@entity8 has has been described in secret emails from the president of @entity50 contractor @entity49 as being on a ' witch hunt ' of investigative journalists .
the day he was killed , @entity3 sent an email to his editors alerting them that the federal government was investigating him and interviewing his ' close friends and associates '
@entity3 ' widow says she *believes* his death was probably just a tragic accident
