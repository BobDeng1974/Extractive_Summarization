the widening gap between rich and poor has held back the economy in @entity2 , a new report warns today			0
in the last two decades rising inequality knocked almost 9 percentage points off growth in the @entity2 , the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) said			2
the global think tank said taxes on the rich did not damage the economy , and could be used to help families with children to improve their lives			0
economic growth in most major countries would have been much higher without the impact of inequality between the rich and poor , according to the @entity4 countries where income inequality is falling grow faster than those with rising inequality , the body 's latest report states			1
' the gap between rich and poor is now at its highest level in 30 years in most @entity4 countries , it said			1
as a result , income inequality has curbed economic growth ' significantly '			1
the overall increase in income inequality has been driven by the very rich 1 per cent of earners dramatically increasing their wealth , pulling away from the rest of society			2
but the biggest challenge to growth has been families on lower incomes ' slipping behind '			0
the @entity4 said : ' this negative effect of inequality on growth is determined not just by the poorest income decile but actually by the bottom 40 % of income earners			1
' in part this is because people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to invest in and improve their education , making it harder for them to increase their earning potential			0
the report studied how changes in inequality between 1985 and 2005 affected subsequent economic growth between 1990 and 2010			1
it found that an increasing gap between the haves and have nots has knocked almost 9 percentage points off gross domestic product ( gdp ) in the @entity2 , 10 in @entity65 and @entity66 and between six and seven in the @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 in the two decades pre-recession			0
the report could put pressure on @entity74 to do more to target the wealthy in the tax system to support those on lower incomes the @entity4 called for tax rises to be used to redistributed wealth from the richest to the poorest , insisting it would not harm growth , ' provided these policies are well designed and implemented '			1
@entity4 secretary general @entity83 said : ' this compelling evidence proves that addressing high and growing inequality is critical to promote strong and sustained growth and needs to be at the centre of the policy debate			2
' countries that promote equal opportunity for all from an early age are those that will grow and prosper			0
' it is the gap between the bottom 40 per cent and the rest of society , not just the poorest 10 per cent , that contributes to the effects of inequality on a country 's growth , the paper said			1
the report is part of the think - tank 's efforts to find the root causes and see what lessons can be learned from the global financial crisis			0
anti-poverty programmes are not enough to tackle the problem , the @entity4 warned , claiming ' education is the key '			0
the paper claims to have discovered new evidence that the main way inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from poor socio - economic backgrounds , lowering social mobility and hampering skills development			2
while the children of parents who have had low levels of education see their educational outcomes deteriorate as income inequality rises , there is little or no effect on people whose parents have had a middle or high level of education , it said			0
the paper states that investment is needed in high - quality education , training and healthcare in order to create greater equality of opportunities , and it claims redistributing taxes and benefits does not harm a country 's economic growth so long as the policies are ' well - designed , targeted and implemented ' .			1

inequality gap wider than at any point in 30 years in most countries
@entity4 warns long - term trend is curbing economic growth ' significantly '
biggest impact on growth is the bottom 40 % of income earners
think tank says tax system should be used to redistribute wealth
