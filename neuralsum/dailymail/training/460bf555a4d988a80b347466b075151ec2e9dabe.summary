by @entity0 @entity1 has announced a new reality tv show which will follow the escapades of soon - to - be nuns , entitled @entity5			1
the unscripted series will sneak behind the doors of a @entity9 convent and delve into the lives of five woman with a big decision to make : whether or not to fully commit themselves to @entity14			2
the wannabe nuns will live and work in the convent as they take part in what is traditionally the first step in entering this religious order , the ' discernment phase			2
' breaking bad habits : @entity1 's new reality tv show will follow five wannabe nuns as they enter a monastery for a trial period , where according to the network , their devotion will be ' truly tested ' ( file photo ) over six hour - long episodes , where the hopeful ' servants of @entity14 ' will live according to the vows of chastity , poverty and obedience , each woman will undergo a program which will ' truly test their devotion			1
' already , the premise of the show is skirting the lines of ' reality ' , as women do n't usually live in a convent during this phase			0
once they have opened their minds to the possibility of joining the sisterhood , as it exists in the real world , a young woman will traditionally spend her discernment phase - amid her usual setting - pondering the pros and cons of forgoing single or married life			0
round two : original series , @entity59 , followed ( from left ) , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , on their travels to @entity63 , all of whom have now returned to @entity69 except for @entity68 next she transitions into the ' postulancy ' phase , which is a six month test period in which she will live according to the requirements of a nun , to see if the lifestyle truly appeals			0
only then will she be accepted to live in a convent for one to two years , without taking vows , until she is finally absolutely certain that she is ready to live an ordained life - at which point she is permitted to take her vows			0
of course , in the land of @entity1 - which is hiring the same producers who bought us the questionable ' reality ' show , @entity59 - the standard process is ' accelerated ' , according to the network			1
@entity1 and collaborator @entity87 are in the process of finalizing the convent and location for @entity5 , and a premiere date has not yet been determined .			1

the @entity5 will be produced by the same team who bought us breaking @entity97
