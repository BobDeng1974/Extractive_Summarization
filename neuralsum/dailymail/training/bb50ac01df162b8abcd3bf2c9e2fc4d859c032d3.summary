by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 2 september 2013 a @entity2 warship fired on and killed three whales during the @entity4 after mistaking them for enemy submarines			1
the startling revelation is contained within new eyewitness accounts of the tense days aboard anti-submarine frigate @entity9 during the 1982 conflict in the southern seas			1
radar on the @entity15 ship was unable to distinguish between attacking ' @entity16 ' of subs and a pod of whales			1
in one instance , two of the mammals were killed by torpedoes and the third was attacked by one of the ship â€™s helicopters			1
contact : @entity9 , a type 22 frigate of the @entity15 , killed three whales after mistaking them for enemy submarines while engaged in the @entity4 , it has emerged engineer @entity31 , whose account was written five years ago and only just been published on www.hmsbrilliant.com - a site dedicated to recording the testimony of crew for posterity			1
in an extract from his experience of the @entity4 , he wrote : ' during the day we went to @entity40 a number of times as we were receiving reports of enemy aircraft taking off from their bases on the mainland			1
they were chased off by our @entity50 ( combat air patrol )			2
' searches and attacks went on until darkness , when we broke off and headed back to the main group			2
' our tally for the day was a pair of whales			1
sadly , their signature on sonar is similar to that of a submarine			0
the torpedo petty officer gained the sobriquet " @entity16 "			1
' vital role : @entity9 was sent to the @entity4 to protect @entity66 , pictured , one of @entity2 's two aircraft carriers , from @entity70 attack brilliant had been deployed to the @entity4 to protect one of @entity2 's two aircraft carriers from @entity70 submarine and missile attack			0
the brush with whales was not a rare occurrence , judging by the testimony of @entity9 's captain @entity79			1
recollection on instance , he wrote : ' @entity83 went chasing submarines , which proved rather less than successful			1
i had received a typical @entity87 signal : " an aircraft has reported sighting a submarine twenty miles north of @entity91			0
go find him and bring me back his hat			0
" ' i knew if we found him he 'd be on the bottom and the whole place was littered with old whaling ships			0
' we would find something , ping on it and it would look about the size of a small submarine , so we 'd fly a helicopter with a magnetic detector over it and , yes , it would say it 's metal			0
but i did n't have enough bombs to cover each wreck , and very few helicopters with metal detectors on them			0
' the place was also full of whales , which gave enormous echoes on the sonar			2
every so often a whale would come up , give a little blow , and a flock of seagulls would gather round , appearing as a quick flash on the radar			2
@entity121 : the signature of the whales picked up on @entity9 's radar gave the crew the impression they were enemy submarines			1
( @entity129 picture ) ' everybody would say , " @entity136 , it must be a submarine , " and we launched a few torpedoes at things like that			0
' all in all , it was a total frustration but , looking back , i 've a feeling that one of those wrecks was the @entity143 and i think that eventually the analysis boys will confirm it			0
' however , whales were not a totally benign presence in the water			2
within the accounts from crew , one member recalls how the ship sustained damaged after colliding with one of the enormous mammals			2
he noted : ' after about twelve months we had the misfortune to collide with a whale , which broke away some of the steel plates that covered the rudder			0
after a few more convoys some more of the plates came away , so it was back to @entity2 for repairs and another refit , this time in @entity165			0

radar on the war ship registered whales as ' @entity16 ' enemy submarines
