by @entity0 published : 13:45 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:48 est , 15 february 2014 perched just nine yards from the cliff edge and facing the certain prospect of falling into the @entity6 , this house was unlikely to top any new buyers ' wish list			1
but the semi-detached home in @entity11 near @entity12 in @entity13 has sold , a month before it was due to go up for auction			1
the property was snapped up by mystery buyers , lured , it is thought , by a council policy aimed at helping the new owner build a brand new property in a safer spot once their new home has been demolished			0
now : the house , which is about 26ft from the edge of the cliff following december 's surge tides at @entity11 near @entity12 , has sold for an undisclosed sum in 1998 : the house , near the centre of this picture , was on firmer ground before neighbouring buildings disappeared the house was a mile inland in the 17th century but is now just 26ft from the crumbling cliff edge			1
there has been continuous erosion over the centuries , with the house ' moving ' 2ft closer to the sea during storms which lashed the cliffs last month			1
the home was bought for an undisclosed sum after being listed with a guide price of between £ 25,000 and £ 50,000			0
it was due to be offered for auction on march 13 by @entity47 of @entity48			0
but the sale completed on february 5 after the mystery buyer came forward			0
and complete with their keys , the new owners have the promise from @entity54 that they will be given financial help - believed to be to the tune of £ 10,000 - and planning permission to demolish their stricken home and build a new property on a safer plot in the area			1
the authority has established a special scheme to help those homeowners at risk of losing their homes to the force of nature			0
@entity70 , whose insolvency firm is selling the house , said : ‘ we have been very clear about the property ~ s future and have informed interested parties of the problems			0
' the only reason anyone would want to purchase it is for the opportunity it affords for the development of another site in the locality			0
' speaking when the house went on the market , mr @entity70 said : ' it may sound crazy to try selling a house that close to the edge of an eroding cliff			2
november 2010 : @entity54 said assistance would be available under its scheme for new owners of blighted houses october 2009 : @entity54 council 's @entity97 scheme has offered nine @entity11 landowners up to £ 25,000 towards building and moving costs december 2008 : the council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available ‘ but by owning this property you could potentially get planning permission for another plot of land that you would n't otherwise be able to			1
coastal erosion is the wearing away of rock by destructive waves hitting the coastline			0
there are four major forms : ‘ plots of land near @entity12 with planning permission are clearly highly sought - after , so we hope to be able to sell the clifftop home , even in the knowledge that it will have to be demolished			1
’ @entity54 council 's @entity97 scheme has offered nine @entity11 landowners up to £ 25,000 towards building and moving costs			1
coun @entity128 , chairman of the @entity97 board , said : ‘ if you are in danger of losing your property to erosion and you sell it , the new owner would still have planning rights to build elsewhere			1
‘ the whole policy is an attempt to deal with coastal blight , so it could work to buy a house on a clifftop and move inland and take their planning permission with them			1
’ the council said it expected the owners of clifftop properties to have them demolished before they fell on to the beach and financial help was available for this			2
@entity150 , who lives next door to the home which has been sold , admitted she could not afford to buy or build another house elsewhere			2
she added that her long - term plan was to live in a caravan in her back garden , which is further inland than her house			2
the 57 - year - old said : ‘ i 've got no plans to try and demolish my house because it 's not in immediate danger but you ca n't make predictions about the future rate of erosion - nobody can			2
’ other examples of major coastal erosion have happened across @entity168 over the past few years			0
last april a house bought for £ 154,000 in a telephone auction by retired police officer @entity171 in february 2010 fell 300ft into the sea off @entity173 , @entity174			2
in parts of @entity176 , the fast receding coastline has been severely damaged - with 6,000 truckloads of sands washed away in just three years at @entity181 beach in @entity182			0
worried owners of a holiday park overlooking the beach said the damage threatens the future of the seafront .			0
