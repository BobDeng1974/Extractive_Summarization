by @entity0 published : 23:48 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 20:21 est , 19 february 2013 a proposed wind farm on the rugged moors that inspired the @entity3 has been banned after the area 's literary significance was taken into consideration			1
plans to erect turbines on the @entity10 countryside that inspired @entity11 have been met with significant criticism from campaigners			1
@entity14 has halted plans for a development entailing a 15m turbine at @entity18 , @entity19 , near @entity20 , where the @entity3 grew up			1
blocked : @entity14 has halted plans for the building of a 15 metre tall turbine at @entity18 , @entity19 , near @entity20 ( pictured ) where the @entity3 grew up planners have put the sisters ’ literary legacy before the government ’s green energy agenda in what is thought to have been the first decision of its kind			1
the area attracts visitors from around the world wanting to see the moorland views that inspired much of the @entity38 ’s finest writing			0
more than a dozen applications for turbines have been submitted to @entity14 in the past year , on top of the plans approved by neighbouring @entity43 for @entity44			1
but now @entity14 planners have ruled that the scheme would do little to boost renewable energy - while creating a blot on @entity3 country			2
@entity50 , chairman of @entity51 , said : ' @entity51 has objected to a number of wind farm proposals this year on the grounds of skyline pollution and the potential for damage these towering structures have on the tourist economy of the area			1
' this decision by @entity14 in respect of the single turbine in @entity19 gives support to the @entity51 ’s argument that this is a special and unique landscape and that this landscape needs to be protected			1
literary : the development proposed 15 wind turbines but planners took into account the area 's literary significance she added : ' visitors journey from around the world come to see the wild moors of @entity38 ’s @entity11 and want to see high waving heather - not high waving turbines			1
' i am delighted by this decision and that all future applications will have to take into account the importance of the historical and literary associations of the area			0
' the planning ruling states : ' the proposed development would introduce an incongruous and widely visible vertical element into this sensitive upland landscape , whose historical and literary associations are also central to its wider economic value in tourism terms			2
inspiration : the @entity10 moors are thought to have provided the inspiration for @entity38 's classic novel @entity11 ' the proposed turbine would be seen from a number of vantage points and would result in significant harm to the character of the landscape that would outweigh its limited contribution towards overall renewable energy targets			1
' officers also felt the turbine could harm the area ’s wildlife being located just 210 metres from the @entity112			0
campaigners are also concerned about plans for four 328ft high turbines next to a popular tourist trail			2
the £ 12million scheme , proposed by green energy firm @entity118 , would see two turbines flanking each side of the @entity121 on @entity122			0
mrs @entity50 believes the planning agenda has now changed and developers may have no choice but to back down			0
she said : ' the decision will surely make a difference to outcome of future applications			0
but the grounds on which it has been refused are the same grounds as the @entity51 put forward in 2012 - without any success - for much larger schemes			0
' in making this decision , @entity134 acknowledges for the first time the importance of the unique landscape to the area			0
' we are delighted the council is leading the way such that surely any future applications will also have to take into account ‘ the importance of the historical and literary associations of the area			0
' @entity51 heritage and conservation officer @entity149 said : ' it is good they have acknowledged the importance of this heritage landscape , and internationally renowned heritage area			2
' we ’ve been arguing for some time that turbines have a negative impact on this landscape			0

@entity14 halted plans for development at @entity19 , near @entity20
