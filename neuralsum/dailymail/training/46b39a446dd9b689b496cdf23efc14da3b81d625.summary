according to a spokesperson from the @entity9 , there has been a huge influx of inquiries from would - be hikers eager to follow in the footsteps of the best - selling author and attempt the mammoth trek , which stretches from the @entity17 border with @entity18 up to the @entity20 border			1
' we 've had a lot of calls from people who have said ' i 've read the book and i really want to do [ the trek ] , ' the @entity9 's @entity21 told @entity29			1
' starting a new life ' : @entity31 is training for the trek , which she hopes to complete at least a portion of in the @entity34 inspiration : @entity31 received a copy of @entity3 's book from her mother for @entity39 and admits she found the story incredibly empowering but ms @entity21 added that the increased number of hikers starting out on the tricky and often dangerous path has also meant an increase in the number of accidents			1
she explained : ' we are really stressing that people be prepared in order to cut down on the possibility of a rescue			2
' both @entity3 's book and the recently - released movie clearly depict the dangers involved in attempting to tackle the trail ; at one point the then 26 - year - old former heroin addict has a close encounter with a wild bear , while another passage describes her desperate attempt to cross a treacherous snow - covered mountain without any of the proper equipment			1
in fact , the novice hiker readily admitted how ill - prepared she was for her lonely adventure , which saw her cover 1,100 miles of the @entity1 over several months			2
having packed an assortment of bulky equipment and personal items - including a number of weighty books and journals - before starting the trek , she then added a staggering 24.5 pounds of water to the weighty backpack , which she later christened ' @entity78 ' thanks to its impressive bulk			1
strayed also braved sweltering temperatures of up to 100 degrees at some points along the trail , before being plunged into freezing conditions when she reached the mountains			0
having walked hundreds of miles in a pair of boots that were one size too small , @entity3 was then forced to duct - tape some sandals in the hopes of protecting her feet from the hazardous conditions			2
the pursuit of happiness : @entity100 dealer @entity98 said that , during her trek , she discovered that she is ' the one person who makes herself happy ' determination : the 52 - year - old believes that anyone can complete the trail , if they have enough motivation and in addition to the hazardous environmental conditions and numerous problems with her equipment , @entity3 also had to face the dangers posed by other hikers she met along the way			1
at one campsite , she fled from a pair of men who made threatening comments about her appearance and the fact that she was alone , while at another point a couple running a campsite threw her off their land because she was unable to pay their camping fees			0
but , surprisingly , none of that has stopped scores of women from wanting to experience the journey for themselves			2
' after i read her book , i got the maps , ' @entity135 - based @entity100 dealer @entity98 told @entity29			2
' after reading what she went through , i knew that anybody could do the trail			0
' i found out that i 'm the one person who makes myself happy			0
' @entity31 , who is currently training to take on a portion of the trail this coming @entity34 , added that she was inspired to try her hand at the lengthy trek after her mother gave her a copy of @entity3 's book			1
inside the cover of the copy is written : ' to @entity151 , @entity152			0
may you find your own journey			0
' @entity156 quality : @entity6 's performance in the recently - released big screen adaptation of @entity4 has already earned her a number of award nominations where it all started : strayed first set out on the mammoth trek when she was just 26 ' it makes your own personal struggles and problems seem so small , ' @entity31 explained			1
' starting a new life for her was finding herself on this trail and i kind of was in that same point in my life			0
' it 's such an empowering story for women			0
it will encourage a lot of people to find themselves on a trail , hiking versus other forms of therapy			0
' @entity182 , caretaker at a hikers ' rest stop called @entity185 , revealed that he has seen a huge surge in the numbers of people passing through on their way to completing the @entity1 - and added that the popularity of the trail will likely increase thanks to the release of @entity4 the movie			1
' we had 700 hikers last year , ' he revealed			0
