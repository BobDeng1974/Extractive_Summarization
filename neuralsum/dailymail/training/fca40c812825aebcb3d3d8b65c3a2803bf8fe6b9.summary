a new treatment developed by @entity2 scientists could significantly improve the ability of radiotherapy to save the lives of cancer patients			1
more than 50 per cent of people with cancer are treated with radiotherapy , which kills tumour cells and boosts the body ’s own ability to fight off the disease			2
but its success is limited by the ability of some cancer cells to become resistant to the treatment			1
those resistant cells stubbornly survive and in some cases can grow into new tumours			2
now scientists at the @entity23 have discovered the reason why radiotherapy does not always work - and they have worked out a way to boost its success			2
pharmaceutical firm @entity42 is already starting large clinical trials in a bid to turn the discovery into a widely - available treatment			0
dr @entity47 , who led the @entity49 team , said the breakthrough had come with the discovery of a ‘ molecular shield ’ which helped cancer cells survive the radiotherapy treatment			1
the shield – a protein called @entity32 – tricks the body ’s defences into thinking that cancerous cells pose no threat			1
dr @entity47 and his colleagues found that injecting an antibody into the blood stream of mice could block the @entity32 protein , destroying the shield and allowing the cancer cell to be killed			1
it is now being tested in humans and dr @entity47 is confident of further promising results			0
he said : ‘ this treatment is being tested in clinics already			0
we hope we can reduce the rate of people who see their cancer return after radiotherapy			0
‘ these are very exciting discoveries			0
’ dr @entity47 , whose team was funded by @entity82 and @entity42 , said : ‘ one of the ways that radiotherapy works is that it stimulates the body ’s immune response against cancer cells			2
‘ but in some cancers patients with higher levels of this @entity32 protein go on to do quite poorly			2
‘ it provides a molecular shield to the cancer cells , providing an immune escape so the body does not realise the cells are a threat			1
’ the new antibodies work by stopping the @entity32 protein from working , allowing the immune system to destroy them			0
researchers discovered that injecting an antibody could block the @entity32 protein , destroying the shield and allowing the cancer cells to be killed			1
they called it an ' exciting discovery ' @entity32 proteins have been discovered in some patients with lung cancer , skin cancer and bladder cancer - and they may be active in other forms of cancer			1
dr @entity47 added : ‘ combining certain immunotherapies with radiotherapy could make them even more effective and we ’re now looking to test this in clinical trials to see just how much of a difference it could make			0
’ professor @entity123 , @entity82 ’s chief scientist , said : ‘ around half of all cancer patients are given radiotherapy and it has been at the heart of helping improve survival rates so that today one in two cancer patients will survive for at least ten years			1
‘ doctors and researchers are constantly looking for ways to improve treatments and this approach could open the door to a whole new way of giving radiotherapy			0
’ dr @entity145 , director of oncology research at @entity146 - the research arm of @entity42 - added : ‘ @entity146 is committed to developing strong science led collaborations , and supporting research that helps further advance our scientific understanding in the important area of immunotherapy			0
‘ the findings described in the recent study with @entity82 are extremely encouraging			0

more than half of cancer patients are treated with radiotherapy
but some cancer cells become resistant to it and grow into tumours
scientists discovered that proteins @entity32 for a ' molecular shield '
this shield stops radiotherapy from killing cancerous cells
injecting an antibody can block the protein , destroying the shield
antibody allowed radiotherapy to work , killing all the cancer cells
has been called an ' exciting discovery ' and now being tested on humans
