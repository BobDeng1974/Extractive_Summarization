by @entity0 changing times : famous for going door - to - door , @entity2 have taken to the streets it 's a practice that 's been the butt of jokes for decades : a pair of @entity2 turning up suited and booted on your doorstep			1
but the days of the 140 - year - old religious order 's members trudging door - to - door in the rain could soon be numbered			1
thousands have switched tactics to stand on street corners in more than a dozen cities across @entity22 - and unusually for public preachers , they are staying almost completely silent			1
leaders believe it is a better tactic in modern @entity22 , where people do not like being approached directly and prefer browsing as if in a shop			1
three years after the same tactic was introduced in @entity30 , witnesses have been standing on pavements in at least 13 cities across @entity22 and handing out tens of thousands of magazines			1
unlike other evangelical preachers , they do not shout or call attention to themselves - instead standing in near - silence until someone approaches them			0
' i guess that 's just not our style , ' said @entity42 , a spokesman for the @entity2 at their @entity44 headquarters			1
' we have used inventive approaches down the years			0
we used " sound cars " in the 1930s which would relay lectures in the street from megaphones on the roof			2
' @entity52 was used a lot later on and our members wore placards and sandwich boards			1
but now it 's more organised , particularly in larger cities where there 's tremendous footfall			2
' i think this method is effective because it allows individuals to take the initiative rather than us approaching them			0
' people find certain approaches more appealing to them			2
if you go into a shop some people prefer to browse and then at the right time they 'll be asked if they 'd like some help			2
' jokes : there are 8million members of the movement around the world , but they often have front doors slammed in their faces			1
leaders say door - to - door work will continue but people are often not at home grumpy commuters already spend their time batting away free newspapers , magazines , leaflets and charity collectors - but mr @entity42 said : ' people tell us that for them , they prefer that approach			1
' some former believers claim door - to - door preaching - which has been widely parodied for decades - is unpopular with members who earn a hostile reception on the doorstep			0
former member of 14 years @entity99 , who wrote @entity100 : how a gay child was saved from @entity102 , said hitting the streets could be the only way to ' clock up ' enough hours of service			0
he said : ' @entity2 require a certain amount of " field service , " or time spent recruiting , in order to maintain their standing in the congregation			0
' anyone who does not fulfill those requirements will receive admonishment from the elders , and could also be considered " inactive "			0
there is a tremendous amount of pressure within the congregation to fulfill the hourly requirement			0
' print run : the organisation wants to build a new headquarters the size of seven football pitches near @entity130 , @entity131 , which could print 184,000 copies an hour of magazines such as @entity134 mr @entity42 insisted ' nothing 's changed ' with the movement 's stance on doorstepping , which still takes place			1
but he admitted : ' we find a lot of people might not be home , especially during the week			1
' people we might not find door - to - door , we find in the street			2
' the new recruits in the street include 1,000 in @entity44 alone , with others in @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161			1
there are also street ' @entity163 ' in @entity165 , @entity166			0
media - savvy : leaders are now analysing which themes shift the most magazines they come from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and more are women than men , but mr @entity42 said this was because many believers have husbands who work full - time			0
the movement was founded in the 1870s by @entity179 , a @entity180 from @entity181 , @entity182 , and now has around 8million members			1
they adopted the name @entity2 in 1931 to reflect the fact that they believe only in direct worship to @entity189 ( @entity190 ) and not the traditional @entity191 of ' father , son and @entity194 '			0
certain beliefs - including refusal to salute flags , fight in armed services or accept blood transfusions , even for children - have brought ' @entity163 ' in to direct conflict with governments			2
they are also not accepted as a doctrine by mainstream @entity204 and former members such as mr @entity99 claim they are like a ' cult '			0
but the organisation presides over vast numbers of members worldwide and millions of pounds in funding			0
next month 50,000 believers will descend on @entity214 in south west @entity44 for a convention in more than a dozen languages			1
and in january , the global movement announced its plans to open a new @entity22 headquarters the size of seven football pitches on the outskirts of @entity130 , @entity131			1
if built the centre could provide a base for 800 believers , several acres of gardens and a printing room capable of churning out 184,000 magazines every hour			0
@entity2 - whose celebrity members include the singer @entity234 and tennis champion sisters @entity232 and @entity233 - are also becoming more media - savvy			0
leaders say the may issue of @entity239 ! , their main magazine alongside @entity134 , shifted record numbers because it was themed around stress , a general topic with which everyone could connect			0
in response the movement is repeating almost exactly the same theme in its september issue , which will be about ' burnout ' .			2
