by @entity0 published : 06:35 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 07:23 est , 24 october 2013 a stream of brightly - coloured butterflies have been spotted smothering the heads of turtles as they try and drink their tears			1
the strange sight occurs because the orange @entity8 butterflies and yellow sulphur butterflies require the nutritional benefits of salt			1
being a long way from any source of sodium in the @entity17 rainforest , the butterflies take advantage of the turtles ' salt - rich tears and surround their heads looking for a drink			1
mr @entity34 , 35 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , said : ' we thought it was hilarious			2
' we 're used to one or two butterflies on a turtle but these ones seem to be absolutely smothered in butterflies			0
' i would say there were about 15 turtles in all up and down the river but there were loads of butterflies			0
' the terrapins - a type of freshwater turtle - were basking in the sun to collect heat and energy for the day when the butterflies flocked to them			0
much like humans , a turtle 's sweat is rich in salt and animals in the region have to drink their tears because they are nowhere near an ocean			2
according to mr @entity35 , a 27 - year - old phd student in ecology and evolutionary biology at @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77 , the still turtles are an easy target for the feeding behaviour , which is known as mud - puddling			2
cooperative animals : the turtles seem unperturbed by the intrusion into their personal space and are apparently very patient with the gentle touch of butterflies			1
however , they are not as placid when bees try to drink their tears sweaty benefits : much like humans , a turtle 's sweat is rich in salt and orange @entity8 butterflies and yellow @entity96 butterflies rely on the unusual source for their sodium he said : ' as you go further from the @entity103 , the general availability of salt decreases in the environment because there is less of it in the rain			1
' so , in the western @entity17 region far from the @entity103 , odd behaviours pop up to account for this , including drinking the tears of turtles and caiman			0
' the butterflies tend to attract each other , so if one butterfly is feeding , its bright colors invite other butterflies to that site to feed as well			0
' some experts believe that the insects cleanse the turtles ' eyes in return for the drink , but mr @entity35 said ' i do n't believe that 's very likely ' amazingly , the turtles are apparently unperturbed by the intrusion into their personal space and are apparently very patient with the gentle touch of butterflies			1
however , they are not as placid when bees also come to drink turtle tears for sodium			1
mr @entity35 said : ' when bees come by to drink from the turtles ' tears , they appear to get agitated and will dodge their head around and try and swat the bee away			1
' i imagine the butterflies are a bit gentler and have narrower mouth parts that the turtles seem okay with			0
snap happy : travel photographer @entity34 and biologist @entity35 worked together in @entity36 , @entity37 to capture the sight and said they had never seen so many butterflies gather at once some experts believe that the insects cleanse the turtles ' eyes in return for the drink , but mr @entity35 said ' i do n't believe that 's very likely			1
' ' more likely is that this relationship is a form of commensalism , in which the butterfly benefits from the turtle and the turtle is n't really affected either way			0
' butterflies in this area will do anything for salt , including drinking from your sweaty skin or backpack , ' he said			0
' i bet that if you laid out with your skin covered and your eyes open , you may eventually have a swarm of colorful butterflies imbibing on your tears , too			0
' special relationship ? mr @entity35 believes the butterflies benefit from the turtle and the turtle is n't really affected either way			2
he said the pretty insects will do anything for salt , including drinking human sweat			0

travel photographer @entity34 and biologist @entity35 captured sight in @entity36 , @entity37 and said they *'d* never seen so many butterflies at once
it occurs because range @entity8 butterflies and yellow sulphur butterflies require the nutritional benefits of salt and turtle tears are rich in sodium
the biologist said that while turtles seem unperturbed by the gentle touch of butterflies , they are not as placid when bees come to drink their tears
