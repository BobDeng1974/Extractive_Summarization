@entity0 unveiled a new spring menu earlier this week , prompting a flurry of excitement from the food chain 's biggest fans - and a series of serious warnings from health experts about the calorie - laden food options , some of which contain more than half of an adult 's recommended daily intake of salt			1
the new menu contains five new food options - two 340 - calorie cheesecake - filled donuts , one 380 - calorie loaded bagel , one 640 - calorie chicken - filled pretzel bun and a ' low fat ' 210 - calorie steak and cheese wrap			1
' this new menu is laden with calories and fat			0
many of these calories are considered " empty calories " meaning that they have little or no nutritional value , ' cardiologist dr @entity27 told @entity32			2
warnings : @entity0 ' new spring menu features the 640 - calorie @entity35 which contains 68 per cent of your daily allowance of salt sweet tooth ? the new menu also features two new flavors of the chain 's @entity41 , which each contain upwards of 340 calories obesity and obesity - related illness has become epidemic ; in the @entity50 alone obesity and obesity - related illness accounts for a $ 150 billion dollars of healthcare expenditures annually ' as adults we must set good examples for our children because they pattern our behavior we must avoid eating food such as these presented on the new menu at @entity0			1
' indeed , the food chain 's new @entity60 - which is described on the @entity0 website as containing ' delicious breaded chicken , cheddar cheese , bacon and honey mustard ' which are all ' served on an oven - toasted pretzel bun ' - contains a whopping 640 calories , almost a third of your recommended daily intake			1
additionally , the sandwich contains 1,560mg of sale , which is equal to 68 per cent of the daily recommended intake of 2,300mg			0
the roll also contains 25g of fat - 38 per cent of your daily intake			0
and when paired with one of @entity0 ' new ice cream - inspired coffee flavors - @entity81 , @entity82 , or cookie dough swirl - customers are adding a minimum of 200 odd calories to their meal , if they opt for whole milk and sugar in their coffee			0
another option listed on the new menu is the @entity93 , which is stuffed with cheese , corn , black beans , peppers , tomatoes , onions and spices and contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt - which is 37 per cent of the recommended intake			0
something savory : the @entity93 contains 380 calories and 890mg of salt healthy ? the 210 - calorie @entity106 ’ @entity107 is intended to be a low - calorie alternative to the other menu options , however it still contains 25 per cent of your daily saturated fat intake healthier than the pretzel roll , yes , but still not the most nutritious treat around			1
indeed , the only ' healthy ' option offered on the new menu is a small @entity106 ’ @entity107 , a 210 - calorie snack that contains ' our delicious angus steak , a slice of cheddar cheese and honey mustard sauce , wrapped in a warm tortilla '			2
but while this tasty treat is being marketed as a healthier , low - calorie option , it still contains five grams of saturated fats , which is the equivalent of 25 per cent of your recommended daily intake			1
last , but not least , the menu also contains two new varieties of @entity0 ' signature @entity132 , which is essentially a sugary pastry stuffed with cheesecake filling , this time in @entity136 and raspberry flavors			0
and while the nutritional information for these individual sweet treats has not yet been made available on the @entity0 website , the standard @entity132 contains 340 calories and eight grams of saturated fats - 40 per cent of your daily allowance			2
unsurprisingly , the chain 's unhealthy menu options have prompted some health - conscious @entity147 users to voice their concerns over the calorie - laden choices			2
' if @entity0 replaced their white flour with organic whole wheat and sugar with stevia , they would probably still be unhealthy , ' one man wrote , while one woman added : ' these @entity0 options have to be the most unhealthy things ever			0
