by @entity0 and @entity1 former commons speaker @entity2 led a chorus of calls for @entity5 to quit ‘ as a matter of honour ’ last night			1
her comments came as even close allies of @entity10 said the @entity11 should offer to leave the @entity12 following the row over her expenses			1
@entity2 , a widely respected figure across all parties , said the prime minister had made ‘ an error of judgment ’ by allowing mrs @entity5 to remain			2
she added : ' my concern is that @entity29 has taken hard knocks for a long time ... and this does not help at all			2
' it is a matter of honour			0
people in the past , leading members of government , leading members of @entity29 have resigned , and i think it is for @entity38 to have done likewise			0
' and i ’m sad to say that i regard it as an error of judgement on the part of the prime minister that he did n’t quietly say to her : " i think it ’s time to go – thank you for your services , but i think it ’s time to go "			0
' the embattled culture secretary launched a concerted attempt to cling to her job , sending her chief parliamentary aide @entity54 on to the airwaves to condemn continued media coverage as ‘ unnecessary and unacceptable ’			1
but mrs @entity54 only poured fuel on the flames by claiming the minister was the victim of a ‘ witch hunt ’ because of her involvement in the @entity65 reforms of press regulation and legislating for gay marriage			0
the @entity11 used a column in her local newspaper , the @entity69 , to broaden her widely criticised 32 - second apology in the @entity71 last week after being ordered to repay £ 5,800 in overclaimed mortgage costs			1
‘ i am devastated that this has happened , and that i have let you down , ’ she told constituents			0
but last night , mrs @entity5 ’s appeal appeared to be falling on deaf ears , as the @entity69 ’s website was overwhelmed with almost universally negative comments from readers			2
mr @entity10 appeared determined to stand by @entity38 , despite a growing number of @entity83 mps insisting publicly that she should go ahead of a meeting of the parliamentary party today			1
@entity87 again pointed out she had been cleared of the central allegation against her – that she set out to cheat taxpayers to fund a property lived in by her parents			0
but ominously for @entity38 , who was found to have overclaimed for mortgage costs and condemned for her attitude to a sleaze inquiry , even some senior allies of the prime minister now believe she should quit due to the damage being done to her party			1
mrs @entity5 's parliamentary aide , @entity83 mp @entity54 ( right ) sent this text to fellow @entity83 mps pleading for support and blaming @entity106 opposition to press regulation for the ' witch - hunt ' culture secretary @entity5 arrived in @entity87 for this morning 's cabinet meeting and went straight from her car into @entity21 without turning to photographers ex-speaker @entity2 : ' i think it is a matter of honour - a question of honour , quite honestly			1
i regard it as an error of judgement on the part of the prime minister that he did n’t quietly say to her : " i think it ’s time to go			0
" ' a @entity83 mp : ' i think @entity5 has probably had it , i 'm afraid			1
i think she is toast			0
' @entity83 minister @entity124 : ' i can honestly say it would n't be how i would have made an apology ' @entity83 mp @entity127 : ' it would be the prime minister 's decision who he surrounds himself with			1
i am surprised that @entity5 has n't stepped down @entity83 mp @entity132 : ' if i was in that position facing a difficult set of local elections , i would n’t be expecting my colleagues to defend me			1
' @entity83 mp @entity137 : ' knocking on doors in my constituency this weekend people did raise the expenses issue with me and they believe that nothing has changed			1
' @entity83 mp @entity143 : ' i have to say if i was faced with the kind of questions that she is faced with , i would be really quite worried indeed			1
' one said privately : ‘ if she had a shred of self - awareness , she would have offered to go			0
it might not be fair , but life is not fair			0
’ @entity2 said : ‘ i ’m very disagreeably surprised mrs @entity5 did not resign at the weekend when all this blew up			2
‘ this was the time that i think she should have gone to the prime minister and said that she thought she ought to relinquish her @entity12 position , and i think the prime minister should have been gracious enough to accept that			0
’ the former speaker added : ‘ i think it is a matter of honour – a question of honour ... all my life i ’ve wanted to protect our parliamentary system , which i cherish , and i think that mrs @entity5 is bringing it into disrepute			1
’ parliamentary private secretary @entity168 insisted sections of the media had ulterior motives in calling for @entity38 to resign			0
she said : ‘ there are journalists outside @entity5 ’s house , i think , harassing her children and her parents			2
’ bizarrely , a source close to mrs @entity5 later tried to disown her aide ’s remarks , saying : ‘ @entity5 has never expressed that view			2
’ despite the fightback , a significant number of @entity83 mps believe mrs @entity5 must go			1
there is particular concern in marginal seats , where a few votes could cost the party dear			0
a survey suggested a quarter of conservatives representing such constituencies believe the @entity11 should quit			0
@entity195 mp @entity127 said he was ‘ surprised ’ mrs @entity5 had not stepped down from the @entity12			1
@entity143 said if she was in mrs @entity5 's position she ' would be really quite worried indeed ' ; @entity127 said he was ' surprised ' mrs @entity5 was still in her job ; @entity132 said mrs @entity5 could not expect her colleagues to defend her 1996 : bought double - fronted @entity200 terrace house in @entity201 , south - west @entity202 , for £ 234,000 2005 : elected @entity83 mp for @entity204 2005 - 2009 : claimed £ 90,718 in expenses on the property 2007 : increased the mortgage for a second time to £ 575,000 , with taxpayers meeting the cost 2009 april : stopped claiming expenses 2009 may : commons officials wrote to mps demanding they sign a declaration agreeing to pay capital gains tax on second homes 2010 : became minister for disabled people 2011 : started claiming expenses on renting a property in her @entity204 constituency september 2012 : joined @entity12 as @entity11 december 2012 : @entity223 mp @entity222 made a complaint about claiming expenses because her elderly parents lived in the house 2014 : sold @entity202 home for £ 1.47million , a profit of £ 1.236million april : is cleared on claiming expenses for home where parents lived			1
but standards commissioner said she overclaimed for mortgage bills by £ 45,000			0
standards committee of @entity213 interprets rules differently and said £ 5,800 was owed he said the allegations against her demonstrated the need for a system of ‘ recall ’ , where voters can trigger a by - election if an mp has been found to have broken the members ’ code of conduct			1
‘ in a mature and functioning democracy , her constituents should be able to hold her to account at all times , and not just at the election , ’ mr @entity127 added			0
@entity255 mp @entity255 said : ‘ obviously the whole thing is extremely damaging for the @entity83 , it ’s damaging for @entity29 as a whole and politicians			1
the sooner the matter is resolved the better			0
’ @entity132 , who is defending @entity260 , the most marginal @entity83 constituency in the country , said : ‘ i ’ll just make this point : faced with a difficult set of elections , i would not be expecting colleagues to defend me			2
’ @entity268 members called for @entity38 to resign			0
@entity269 , chairman of the @entity271 and @entity270 , said : ‘ i think anybody that has that sort of thing hanging over them should make their own decision to stand aside			0
‘ she has upset a lot of people by what she has done and i think @entity10 has misjudged it by standing by her			2
’ however , @entity284 secretary @entity283 said mrs @entity5 should ‘ absolutely not ’ resign			2
she added : ‘ i think this issue has been ruled on , i think we should move on i think @entity5 is an excellent secretary of state and she should be left to get on with her job			2
' there ’s been a ruling by the appropriate authorities , it has been complied with			0
’ employment minister @entity124 ( left ) said she would not have made such a short apology to the @entity71 @entity295 , visiting @entity294 today , said only that mrs @entity5 was being ' hounded ' before adding : ' how about that ? ' this is the house in @entity201 , south @entity202 , which @entity38 owned for 19 years , claiming expenses to pay the mortgage for four years , before selling it for £ 1.4million dream home : this is @entity5 's new £ 1.2million converted @entity304 barn in @entity305 , bought after selling her family home in @entity201 for £ 1.4million			1
