by @entity1 reporter of all the reasons to buy a @entity4 - the luxurious , eco-friendly electric cars created by billionaire inventor @entity6 - there 's a new reason with which even the priciest luxury cars ca n't compete : there is nearly a zero - percent chance that it will get stolen			1
in fact , only four teslas have been stolen - ever			0
in 2013 , only three of the pricey cars were stolen - one each in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			0
prior to those three thefts , only one other @entity4 had been stolen since the company was founded in 2003			0
that leaves @entity4 with a theft rate of roughly 0.15 per 1,000 cars produced			1
the median theft rate for all cars is roughly 3.58 thefts per 1,000 vehicles produced , according to the @entity28			1
pricey : a @entity4 has a base price of roughly $ 70,000 - but that has n't made them a target for thieves impressive : teslas have a theft rate of 0.15 per 1,000 vehicles produced , which is better than almost all other popular luxury vehicles and the cars ' impressive theft statistic ca n't be dismissed as a product of the fact that there are n't many @entity4 's on the road - according to @entity43 , ' the auto maker sold about 20,000 cars in the @entity45 last year , according to @entity47 lead analyst @entity46			1
based on that estimate , its theft rate is pretty low at roughly 0.15 per 1,000 cars produced ; the median theft rate for all cars is roughly 3.58 thefts per 1,000 vehicles produced , according to the @entity28			1
' teslas are unlikely to be stolen for a number of reasons - for starters , they 're incredibly difficult to steal			0
additionally , given the market for stolen cars and stolen car parts , it does n't make much sense to steal a @entity4			0
it 's electric : @entity4 is one of the most innovative , eco-friendly electric cars on the road according to @entity70 , an editor at @entity71 , cars are typically stolen for parts			1
but there is n't much demand for stolen @entity4 parts - most people who can afford the upwards of $ 70,000 price tag can afford to buy legitimately purchased parts for the car			2
teslas also have unique @entity83 keys that are nearly impossible to replicate			0
and even if a thief were able to hack into @entity4 's system and bypass the key , it 's unlikely that the company would n't be able to track the stolen vehicle			2
luxury cars typically have theft rates lower than those of economy cars			0
for example , @entity43 cites the @entity28 's latest data showing that ' of the 15,179 @entity96 ’s produced in 2008 , 52 were stolen ( that ’s a rate of 3.43 cars per 1,000 made ) and of the 159 @entity101 autos made in 2006 , one was stolen ( that ’s a rate of 6.29 per 1,000 automobiles )			2
' status symbol : teslas have replaced the @entity106 as the car - du - jour for eco-conscious celebs like @entity109 ( pictured ) budget cars have much higher theft rates , according to the @entity28			0
according to the @entity116 , the vehicles with the highest rates of theft per 1,000 vehicles produced are the @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 .			1

since @entity4 was founded in 2003 only four cars have been reported stolen
*experts* say the low theft rate can be *attributed* for the low demand for @entity4 parts , as most cars typically are stolen to be broken down and sold *strictly* for the parts
@entity4 's theft rate is 0.15 per 1,000 vehicles produced
currently , there are about 20,000 teslas on the road in the @entity45
