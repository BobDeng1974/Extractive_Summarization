by @entity1 reporter published : 22:37 est , 6 october 2013 updated : 08:54 est , 7 october 2013 the @entity2 has released its latest statistics on violent crime in @entity5 and the dubious honor of most violent state belongs to @entity8			1
where there is low income and low rates of education , there are higher rates of murder , rape , robbery and aggravated assault , according to the numbers			1
there are exceptions , though			0
also on the list of 10 most violent states are @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 , which all have better income and education rates than the national average			1
scroll down for the list of 10 most violent states ... violent : a lively shot of the famous @entity31 in @entity32 may hide @entity8 's brutal truth -- the state has the nation 's highest rate of violent crime using the 2012 @entity2 data , 24/7 @entity38 identified the 10 states with the highest violent crime rates per 100,000 residents			1
in addition , they looked at each state ’s income , poverty , and education statistics			0
in all but a few cases , the correlation appeared clear			0
number 9 on the list @entity26 may be wealthy and educated relative to the rest of the country , by extremely high crime in crime - riddled cities likely keeps the @entity26 on the list			1
the same is likely true for the tiny adjoining state of @entity25 , which comes in at number 6 on the list			2
and what of sparsely populated @entity24 ’s appearance on the list ? the relatively better educated and richer than average @entity24 comes in at number 3 , reports 24/7 wall st. , because of its nation - leading rate of forcible rape			1
feeling lucky ? due in part to the gambling and casino industries , @entity65 is the second most violent crime riddled state in the union surprise : most data show that violent crime follows high poverty and low education			1
but @entity24 is above average in those areas			0
nonetheless , it has the nation 's highest rate of forcible rape for every 100,000 people in 2012 , there were 79.7 incidents of the crime in @entity24			1
number 1 @entity8 had the highest rate of aggravated assaults in 2012 and was near the top for murders and robberies			2
like other states on the list , @entity8 ’s crime is concentrated in the more densely populated cities of @entity96 and @entity32			1
using @entity2 data for 2012 , 24/7 @entity38 assembled a list of the top states for violent crime rates per 100,000 residents			1
instead of showing that with the highest populations come the highest crime , the study found that crimes like rape , assault , and murder follow trends in high poverty and low education			1
@entity117 but unlike @entity26 and @entity25 , @entity8 fits the national mold with its high poverty and low education rates			0
at number 2 is the state of @entity65 , where the gambling and casino industries bring with them the nation ’s highest robbery and assault rates			1
the @entity65 also has some of the worst high school and college graduation rates			0
fans of the recently concluded @entity134 series @entity132 will recognize number 4 on the list			2
@entity113 , where violent crime is the fourth worst in the @entity5 , also lays claim to one of the highest rates of drug use in the nation			2
at number 5 is @entity114 , where the poverty and higher education rates rank among @entity5 ’s worst and where the murder rate is the fifth worst in the country			2
number 7 @entity115 is number 1 for its murder rate			2
the @entity151 , which has a poverty rate of almost 20 percent , saw 495 murders in 2012 and 427 people were shot in @entity155 alone			0
in @entity116 , crime rates have been on the decline for 20 years , which is also reflected in the national trend			0
the @entity116 has been improving as far as rape , murders , and other crimes and has seen improved high school graduation rates			0
however , at number 8 , the state has quite far to rise			0
finally , @entity117 comes in at number 10			0
the state had the sixth highest incidence of forcible rape last year , its worst showing in that area since 1994			0
also on the rise is aggravated assault , with 337.3 such crimes for per 100,000 residents in 2012			1
@entity177 senior fellow @entity176 tells 24/7 @entity38 that violent crimes occur with more frequency where people are racially segregated			0
according to @entity176 , the more integrated a place becomes , the more markedly crime is seen to decline because those at the bottom of the economic totem pole may more easily climb into the middle class .			0

a list *compiled* using 2012 @entity2 crime data shows that murder , rape , robbery and assault tends to occur most often in the *poorest* , least educated places
