a hospital in @entity1 is facing outraged calls to fire an @entity4 doctor after she publicly posted deeply personal information about one of her patients onto @entity8 last week			1
dr. @entity9 , who works at @entity10 in @entity11 , is under pressure after she initially complained about a patient who was chronically late for her appointments on the social networking site			1
dr. @entity16 asked her 470 friends on @entity8 whether she should ' show up late for her delivery ' after her patient was ' three hours late for her induction			1
' but went on to divulge in a further comment the patient had previously endured a still - born child			2
scroll down for @entity23 dr. @entity9 is in hot water for her remarks which were re-posted by an unknown individual onto the main page of @entity0 's @entity8 page although @entity16 did n't reveal the patient 's name , the controversy erupted when someone posted a screenshot of the status and the comments to the hospital 's ' @entity36 to be ' @entity8 page			1
critics then flooded to the hospital 's page and said that her discussion of any aspect of a patients history and case was inappropriate			0
dr. @entity9 has not lost her job over the posting she made to @entity8 but has received a severe warning from her hospital over the use of social media however , the post does not reveal specific patient information , such as name and medical status , but does reveal the patient suffered the tragedy at some stage in her past			1
' i hope immediate disciplinary action is taken against each of these individuals , ' wrote @entity64 on @entity0 ’s moms - to - be facebook page			0
' [ @entity16 ] should not be allowed to work with patients if she callously talks about them on her own @entity8 page			1
while she does not name patients on her page she gives personal information about patients which could identify who she is talking about , ' wrote @entity8 user @entity75			1
dr. @entity16 , 33 , graduated the @entity76 in 2010 and has worked in @entity11 since			1
another poster on the wall disagreed with @entity64 , stating that ' the patient 's name was never mentioned ... there are still thousands of women that match that description			2
' @entity85 , who wrote the article on pregnancy website @entity88 that revealed the post , said , ' the situation here is amplified because the patient is pregnant , and the doctor is the one responsible for delivering the baby ( and let ’s get real , there ’s no way we ’re okay with the delivering doctor showing up late to ( the ) baby ’s birth )			2
' the full posting and replies by dr. @entity9 which mention the stillbirth are seen here in from the @entity11 physicians @entity8 page @entity0 has not fired @entity16 , but released the following statement : ' our physician leadership has already called dr. @entity16			1
her comments were definitely inappropriate			2
we are also reviewing them to determine if they violated privacy issues , etc. ' that process requires a more thorough review , but we will determine the appropriate response as quickly as possible			0
in the meantime , know that our physician organization holds its members to the highest standards and strives to improve our service and clinical care through that process			0
' regarding punishment , @entity0 said its physician leadership has spoken to @entity16			0
this @entity8 posting from @entity75 onto the @entity36 to be page expresses the outrage of some towards dr. @entity16 dr. @entity16 works at @entity131 in @entity11 and made the @entity8 post last week ' @entity0 holds its physicians and other co-workers to high standards in ensuring the protection of patient information			1
' we can not comment on specific disciplinary actions , but we will use this as an opportunity to reinforce our standards through additional education of our physicians and co-workers , including appropriate use of social media			0
' dr. @entity148 , the senior managing health editor of @entity149 was unimpressed			0
' the answer is not to get mad at the patient or to launder your frustrations in public , ' said @entity148 , who is also the chairman of the @entity154 at @entity155 in @entity156			2
' as a doctor , our role is to heal the sick – but also educate them , ' @entity148 said			0
' one of the biggest challenges i have as an @entity4 is to make my point on the significance of a good relationship between a pregnant woman and her obstetrician			0
this has to start very early in the relationship			0
