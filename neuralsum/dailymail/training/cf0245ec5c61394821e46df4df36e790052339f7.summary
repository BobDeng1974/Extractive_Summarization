by @entity0 @entity0 ' @entity1 returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for @entity4			0
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			0
in this week ’s column , @entity0 talks about @entity11 , @entity13 tickets and why @entity14 is not a @entity15 ... @entity17 's different gravy on saturday i was at @entity19 where watched a player called @entity11			1
this man is simply a brilliant football player ; finding space , drifting away from defenders and like an @entity25 quarterback he 's always looking for an incisive match - winning pass or shot			1
i remember @entity29 saying it 's easy to destroy a painting , and anybody can do that , but to be an artist and create beautiful things takes you to another level			2
but @entity11 is an artist			1
in the first 20 minutes he scored a beauty and then made two exquisite passes to open up the @entity19 defence			0
the passes were perfectly weighted and through the eye of a needle			0
breaking up play : @entity43 's @entity41 did a good job at breaking up play this man most definitely has the ability to play at the very top of the @entity56 and i 'm sure @entity43 , all their players , supporters and staff and , most importantly , @entity37 will do everything they can to keep him at the club because with him they will win games			1
you 've got to have legs you must have legs in your team if you want to win anything these days			0
we hear people say his legs have gone			0
we hear people say he 's got no @entity74 i watched @entity43 play on saturday they were full of athletes who are quick and , most importantly , full of legs			1
speed kills : @entity79 and @entity43 are able to attack with pace they have pace , and power , they are fast , they are strong , and they are @entity88 teams have players that can not and do not have pace they struggle to get behind the opposition where it hurts and everything is played in front , with plenty of foreplay but very rare full penetration			1
attacking with pace : @entity100 and @entity101 are known for their speedy play i 've been out to watch @entity101 and @entity107 and , similar to @entity43 on saturday , they can keep possession , they can move the ball around but at the key moments the players have the speed to go through get past and get in behind defences			1
without legs , you can not win games			0
@entity117 ... not even @entity118 getting held to ransom by @entity120 over the distribution of @entity13 tickets			1
it brings back good memories to read the story that @entity126 have got to pay @entity56 @entity120 up front for any extra tickets they want for their @entity13 fourth - round tie at the weekend			1
@entity118 have to be very cautious that they will sell out all the tickets that they buy from @entity120 and even though they just sold their main forward , @entity133 , to @entity134 , for a handy sum they do n't want to be caught short			1
@entity13 heroes : the @entity118 players celebrate after knocking out @entity140 @entity139 in the third round replay when i was at @entity144 a few years ago we drew @entity145 for the fifth - round @entity13 tie and they made us pay for 5,000 tickets when it was obvious @entity144 could take probably 8,000 or 10,000 for the relatively short trip down the @entity150 to @entity145			1
the club dug in and would n't gamble for ticket sales and several thousand @entity144 fans missed out on what was a tremendous 2 - 2 draw , played out at @entity155 's			1
my two cousins rang a couple of days before the game requesting a couple of tickets but they had all sold out			0
i knew a @entity145 supporter who had two spare and promptly organised my two cousins , who were in their 30s , to get their tickets			1
earning a replay : @entity165 heads home an equaliser for @entity144 in the 2005 cup tie with @entity145 after being 2 - 0 down we drew 2 - 2 and i rang my cousins from the team bus after the game			1
both their phones were switched off			0
i finally got a call at 9.30pm and they informed me they had been thrown out of the ground and kept in @entity179 for having tickets in the wrong area			0
safe to say they had a memorable afternoon this is the magic of the @entity13 that reminds me of the real magic of the @entity13 , the real stories that go on			2
five days before that special game at @entity155 's i had a letter passed to me in my office at @entity144 's training ground that had been sent to the football club			2
it was a request for one of my players to go to a police station as he had not paid his council tax , had avoided all correspondence and was no longer at the property he was supposed to be living in			2
in other words , it was a warrant for his arrest			0
tricky matter : before the @entity13 tie with @entity145 , @entity0 had to speak to one his players about an unpaid tax bill i 'd been on all the courses , gained my @entity211 licence and attended the @entity213 's business management course at the @entity214			1
but this was obviously a tricky , testing matter			0
so i called the player in before training and he said to me : ' i will pay it when we get paid at the end of the month			0
' i said i do n't think that 'll be good enough they want to speak to you now			0
but he said to me : ' do n't worry gaffer , they wo n't find me as i 'm living at a mate 's house			1
' i said to him : ' on saturday afternoon you 'll be playing in front of 27,000 people with probably about 500 police there , so let 's hope they do n't arrest you in the warm up ! ' @entity239 is no saint talking of @entity145 , they 've been making all the headlines recently			1
i most definitely do not agree that the club will now go into meltdown and that the players will leave because the chairman , @entity14 , has quit			1
it 's important to recognise he has done a good job , guiding the club forward and improving and helping the manager maximise the talented players currently there			2
moving on : @entity14 quit his role as executive chairman of @entity145 this week they have nursed the emerging young talent and done well with player recruitment			1
the young players that @entity145 have – @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 – all these lads have been at @entity145 a long time			1
their academy has been helped with analysts , sports scientists , top schoolboy and youth coaches brought in , to help develop these players , which has made a significant improvement to their first - team squad			0
@entity14 has overseen this , put everything in place , made big decisions and set up a crucial department to go into full detail on every player that has been signed			2
there 's no disputing that			0
staying put : @entity145 manager @entity284 said he will not quit the club - for now however , the players are all under contract and they clearly enjoy playing for @entity284			1
the players will probably be disappointed but footballers very , very quickly move on			0
just as they would 've done had @entity284 quit upon hearing the news that mr @entity291 was leaving			0
the bottom line is , it 's the players going on the pitch to play			2
not the chairman that sits in the boardroom eating prawn sandwiches			0
it 's the manager who should get the credit just as it is the manager who gets the bullet			0
on tuesday night , i watched the @entity13 game between @entity306 and @entity307 at the @entity308			2
it was lovely to see both the managers after the game			0
@entity312 has done a wonderful job getting @entity306 promoted and with no investment managed to keep them hanging on in the @entity315 , which is a fine achievement			2
@entity317 has done a great job at @entity307 , getting them promoted to @entity320 from the @entity321			2
his team put in a great performance to draw 2 - 2			0
doing a good job : both @entity307 boss @entity317 and @entity306 manager @entity312 will be pleased i think both managers were happy with that result : one was probably very relieved to come back and the other tinged with acute disappointment after being 2 - 0 up			1
the public do not know how difficult it is for managers ; the stress , frustration and build - up of anxiety , and when i met @entity312 and @entity339 after the game you can see it had been a difficult evening for both of them			2
it 's draining , it 's tiring , and when i drove away from the @entity308 , i was full of energy and enthusiasm ready for a return to the mad world of the technical area .			0

@entity11 is @entity43 's main man
giant killers @entity118 need to be *careful* over ticket sales
players wo n't quit @entity145 over @entity14
@entity312 and @entity317 will be pleased with @entity13 draw
