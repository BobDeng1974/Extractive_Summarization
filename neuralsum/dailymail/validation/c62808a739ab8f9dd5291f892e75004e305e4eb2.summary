from the aroma of fresh coffee to the unpleasant whiff of the subway , @entity0 has its own heady mix of signature smells			2
while this mixture can , at times , be overpowering , back in the 19th century , smells in the city were far more pungent and permanent than they are today			1
so much so , that the health authorities at the time decided to create maps of stenches to show the location of smells from areas such as oil refineries , fat renderers , slaughter houses and gas works			1
@entity0 began complaining to the @entity23 about ' the most nauseous , foul , stinking , and pestilential odours '			1
as a result , many of the worst - smelling industries ended up in @entity28 , with the industrial landscape leaving its mark there today			1
for instance , the @entity32 area on the border of @entity28 and @entity34 remains the site of a sewage treatment plant now @entity38 has found one of these historic maps from 1870 that shows different industrial sites across @entity43 and @entity28 , as the five boroughs were yet to be consolidated			1
but it was n't just industrial smells that caused problems for @entity0			1
the map was produced at a time when @entity0 was experiencing unprecedented growth			2
during the 1860s and 1870s , 2,000 new buildings were constructed each year , as immigration peaked at 200,000 to 300,000 people annually			2
the increase in population meant an increase in waste			2
public baths , drinking fountains , and restrooms were only built 1897 , and flies plagued the streets			0
as a result , @entity0 began complaining to the @entity23 about ' the most nauseous , foul , stinking , and pestilential odours ' , in the 19th century , it was believed that these foul odors carried diseases , so the @entity70 created the map to highlight the areas affected			1
' trying to show smells , which are not concrete - they 're invisible , they 're ephemeral , they 're always changing - is just a really fascinating cultural project , ' says @entity75 , a historian at @entity76 told @entity77 's @entity38			0
the map was produced at a time when @entity0 was experiencing huge growth			0
during the 1860s and 1870s , 2,000 new buildings were constructed each year , as immigration peaked at 200,000 to 300,000 people annually			0
pictured is a a 1858 panorama of the city the increase in population meant an increase in waste			0
public baths and restrooms were built only after 1897 , and flies were everywhere			0
pictured is an 1884 image of streetcars running past the @entity95 , along @entity96 and @entity97 in @entity43 inhaling the delicate bouquet of a glass of wine can leave most of us at a loss for words to describe what we are smelling			1
but it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell			1
researchers found those who use @entity109 as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour			0
however , native speakers from the @entity116 tribe in @entity117 , @entity118 , described odours far more consistently and in less time than colour			2
the @entity116 have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the @entity123 , a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern @entity125 , have 15 words			0
@entity127 notes how health officials at the time had to sniff the air to document where the smells were coming from and which way they were blowing			0
the map largely highlighted industrial smells and a @entity136 reporter at the time described their job with heavy sarcasm , according to a report by ms @entity75			0
' the homes of these [ sickening stenches ] are along the shores of the @entity145 , and by dodging in and out of slips with a tug - boat , and by creeping and climbing over oil - lighters and rotten string - pieces , they were finally reached by the committeemen without loss of life or limb , ' he said			0
many of the worst - smelling industries ended up in @entity28 , with the industrial landscape leaving its mark there today			1
for instance , the @entity32 area on the border of @entity28 and @entity34 remains the site of a sewage treatment plant			1
@entity38 notes that winds would still carry smells from @entity28 to @entity43 , causing problems between regulators in each of the districts			1
@entity43 had some of its own smells to contend with			1
meat marketing and processing facilities , for example , were established along the shoreline at the time			0
to reduce the smell , the board pushed slaughterhouses north of 40th street in 1868 and then banned them from between 40th street in 1870 , according to @entity177			2
while the idea that smells carry disease has long passed , authorities are still keen to map areas of the city that contribute to illness			1
last month , scientists from @entity185 a unveiled ' microbial map ' of the city after spending 18 months swabbing turnstiles , ticket kiosks , railings and benches for dna on the world 's largest transport system			0
they found 15,152 different types of microorganisms that share the train with its 5.5 million riders , including bubonic plague , dysentery and meningitis			0

in the 19th century , it was believed foul odours from industries such as slaughter houses could carry disease
some businesses , such as sewage treatments plants , ended up in @entity28 to keep smell away from @entity43
winds still carried stench from @entity28 to @entity43 , causing problems between the regulators in both districts
