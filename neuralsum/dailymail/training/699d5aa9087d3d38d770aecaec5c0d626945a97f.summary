it promises to be some wedding			2
@entity2 , 60 , launched the first salvo by sending her future daughter - in - law an email criticising her ‘ staggering uncouthness and lack of grace ’			1
yesterday the father of bride - to - be @entity10 hit back , branding mrs @entity2 a ‘ snotty miss @entity11 ’			1
in the stinging repost , @entity13 , 64 , said the renowned horticulturist ‘ has her head stuck so far up her own a * * * she does n’t know whether to speak or f * * t. ’ family - to - be at war : @entity13 ( left ) has said his family call @entity2 ( right ) ' @entity23 ' and say they do not like her ' snotty ' attitude saying ' she thought she was better than us ' @entity10 still wants to marry @entity27 , pictured today , despite his step - mother 's ranting email and although mrs @entity2 appears fastidious about social mores , it emerged yesterday that she may have become pregnant some months before her first marriage in 1974 , according to public records			1
she is also now on her third marriage			2
the astonishing war of words began after @entity37 , 28 , and her fiancé @entity27 , 29 , spent the weekend at the home of his father @entity40 and stepmother @entity2 in april			1
incensed by her future daughter - in - law ’s apparent lack of manners , mrs @entity2 sent her an email listing all her faults			1
she then sent it twice more to ensure it arrived			2
in the attack she told @entity37 she should attend a finishing school in ‘ utmost haste ’ to get rid of her ‘ bad manners ’			1
she went on to describe her as ‘ an ideal candidate for the @entity53 to @entity55 television series ’			1
happy couple : @entity10 and her fiancé @entity27 are reeling after the venomous message sent by @entity58 bemoaning @entity10 's manners stunned @entity37 , a pa for a @entity62 recruitment firm , sent it on to a select group of friends			1
however , the email was forwarded to others and has now been read by millions on the internet			1
speaking from the £ 450,000 family home in @entity70 , @entity71 , mr @entity13 , 64 , said he would never forgive mrs @entity2 for sending the email			1
‘ @entity10 was very upset and the two of them obviously do n’t see eye to eye , ’ he added			1
‘ i met @entity2 and her husband @entity40 for dinner at a pub in @entity62 last year			1
‘ @entity40 was a jovial chap but @entity2 was quite snotty			1
she had a look about her which made us think she thought she was better than us			2
she kept talking about her five horses and how it made her part of the @entity85 ’s set			2
sitting outside their home in @entity88 , @entity89 , yesterday when the @entity90 said they were ' well aware ' of the criticism by @entity10 's father ‘ ever since that meeting we call her miss @entity11			1
i do n’t care if she apologises			2
you ca n’t take back what has been said once it ’s said			2
’ in the email , mrs @entity2 accused @entity37 of poor table manners , insulting the family in public and failing to send a handwritten card to say thank you after her stay			1
she even said her behaviour had left their pet dog bomber ‘ profoundly upset , depressed and anxious ’			2
@entity27 is getting married to @entity37 in an £ 18,000 ceremony in the great hall of @entity112 in @entity113 in october			2
mrs @entity2 told @entity37 that her decision to get married in a castle smacks of ‘ brash , celebrity style behaviour ’			1
she went on to criticise @entity37 ’ parents for failing to ‘ contribute very much ’ money towards the wedding			2
mr @entity13 said : ‘ the reason we have been unable to contribute as much money was because we both lost our jobs			0
i doubt @entity2 was aware of that when she sent the email			1
we were unceremoniously got rid of without warning in january and have been searching for jobs ever since			0
’ his wife @entity128 , 60 , has since found work as a matron in a care home but he is still looking for work			0
‘ i have no desire to meet @entity2 or @entity40 again before or after the wedding , ’ mr @entity13 added			1
‘ they do n’t know us and we do n’t know them			0
of course at the wedding we will shake hands and toast @entity140			0
’ the young couple met three years ago through mutual friends and soon became close , enjoying a trip to @entity145 in 2009			2
they live in a flat with a shihtzu dog called @entity148 in the affluent district of @entity150 in @entity62			0
@entity27 has an office nearby where he runs an online bike shop			0
a source close to the couple said : ‘ it ’s not going to be a @entity157 wedding with all that kind of pumpkin carriages and tack			0
they are middle - class people with middle - class respectabilities			2
‘ it ’s not like they ’re taking over the entire castle in some vulgar show of excess			0
there ’s a great hall that ’s available and that ’s where they ’re having it			0
‘ they wanted to have as much of a dream wedding as possible			0
they heard about @entity112 and it was available to book , so why not ? it ’s such a lovely setting			0
’ the source added : ‘ @entity27 is an absolutely charming guy and @entity10 is an absolute sweetie			1
i ’ve never heard a bad word said about either of them			0
none of their friends can believe what ’s been said about @entity10			1
‘ @entity188 and unpleasant are the last things you ’d say about her			0
the view of people who know them is that the problem lies with the mother in law			0
’ @entity197 mrs @entity2 , 60 , sent the e-mail to after she was less than impressed with her etiquette when she visited her @entity89 home in april the couple declined to comment on the row yesterday			1
mrs @entity2 and her husband @entity40 confirmed they were ‘ well aware ’ of the criticism by @entity10 ’s father but still planned to go to the wedding			1
when asked if she thought it may be awkward , mrs @entity2 laughed : ‘ we will see			1
’ it is high time someone explained to you about good manners			0
yours are obvious by their absence and i feel sorry for you			0
unfortunately for @entity27 , he has fallen in love with you and @entity27 being @entity27 , i gather it is not easy to reason with him or yet encourage him to consider how he might be able to help you			0
it may just be possible to get through to you though			0
if you want to be accepted by the wider @entity27 family i suggest you take some guidance from experts with utmost haste			1
there are plenty of finishing schools around			0
please , for your own good , for @entity27 ’s sake and for your future involvement with the @entity27 family , do something as soon as possible			0
here are a few examples of your lack of manners : i understand your parents are unable to contribute very much towards the cost of your wedding			0
( there is nothing wrong with that except that convention is such that one might presume they would have saved over the years for their daughters ’ marriages			0
) if this is the case , it would be most ladylike and gracious to lower your sights and have a modest wedding as befits both your incomes .			0

@entity2 told @entity10 she was ' an ideal candidate for @entity53 to @entity55 television series '
she sends *vitriolic* email three times in a day and tells bride - to - be she needs ' guidance from experts '
@entity10 's *shocked* father hits back and says he will never forgive @entity2 for abusing his daughter
he says @entity2 was snotty on the day he first met her
