@entity0 is nothing if not unpredictable			1
by this time last year , she had painted the country in an array of spring colours			2
this year , however , experts reckon she ’s running two weeks behind – the evidence of which can be seen in these pictures			1
the good news is , all that could change this weekend as the sun comes out and temperatures leap into the 60s			2
riot of colour : @entity19 and baby @entity20 enjoying daffodils in bloom in @entity23 , @entity24 in march 2014 waiting game : @entity26 and her son @entity27 are pictured at the same spot yesterday with the daffodils yet to flower bloomin ' lovely : a cherry tree at @entity32 in march 2014 is pictured left while the same tree was still waiting to shine yesterday ( right ) twelve months ago flowers were already in full bloom , blossom was on the trees and wildlife was coming out of hibernation			0
but last month ’s bitter cold snap has slowed things down this year			1
the contrast was noticed at the @entity44 ’s garden at @entity45 , @entity46			0
last year the ground was already clothed in bright yellow and purple crocuses after a mild winter			2
this year only a few flowers poke their heads above the ground			0
@entity53 , curator at @entity45 , said : ‘ we think we are probably about two weeks behind where we were last year			2
it has been a colder winter , the soil has been cooler and it has slowed everything down			2
but a few days of sunshine is all it could take for it to catch up			0
’ student @entity61 is pictured enjoying a field of purple and white crocuses on a sunny spring day in @entity66 , @entity67 this time last year @entity69 is pictured in the same spot in @entity66 yesterday with far fewer crocuses on show than at the same time last year the @entity74 , which monitors the first signs of spring , said wildlife is also emerging slowly this year			2
their volunteers have recorded only half the number of ladybirds they saw in march 2014			0
the average temperature in @entity81 for december , january and february this year was @entity82 – well below last year ’s @entity83			1
but that could all change in the next few days			0
thermometers could nudge past @entity86 ( @entity87 ) on saturday as a tropical mass of air arrives from the @entity90			0
@entity92 wildlife specialist @entity91 said the slower spring is positive for many species , which need time to hibernate properly before they emerge			0
if butterflies , and small mammals awake too early , they tend to suffer later if the weather turns cold again			1
the spring flowers at the @entity44 's garden at @entity45 in @entity46 were already putting on an impressive display by late februay last year in late febraury this year , there were fewer flowers on display on the same patch of land at the @entity44 ’s garden at @entity45 , @entity46 meanwhile , @entity81 is set to be hotter than @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 this weekend as temperatures are expected to soar as high as @entity111 in a bumper start to spring			1
temperatures are set to increase as the week goes on and eventually peak on saturday , where parts of the country are forecast to be warmer than many @entity118 holiday spots			1
much of the country has today seen a bright and sunny day as spring finally arrived , with tomorrow expected to be a dry , but cloudier day , with temperatures rising to @entity121			1
the fine weather will continue in the south on friday , but @entity67 will see rain in the west and gale force gusts of up to 60mph in the north west			0
the weekend is set to be dry , with bright spells in south and south east @entity81 , with temperatures rising to @entity131 and possibly @entity132 in sheltered spots , but the rain will continue in western @entity67			2
sunday will be slightly cooler , but another dry day with a good amount of sunny spells			0
there may be light showers in @entity81 and @entity139 later in the afternoon			0
' the temperatures will get warmer as the week goes on , ' said @entity141 , of the @entity142			1
the sun rises across the @entity144 this morning at the start of a bright and mild day in @entity146 in a sign of things to come , this stunning spring sunset was last night captured over @entity150 in @entity24 a group punt down the @entity152 in @entity32 in what is forecast to be the start of a run of spring weather ' by saturday we could see temperatures of @entity159 or @entity131 and maybe even 16c in a sheltered location in @entity161 or the @entity162			1
' the warm weather will coincide with breezes of 20 - 30mph but temperatures will significantly exceed the average @entity166 for this time of year			1
meanwhile , the early bursts of spring sunshine and a mild winter have seen this year 's first crop of strawberries arrive a week early			1
the first homegrown strawberries of 2015 will arrive in supermarkets tomorrow - days ahead of schedule			0
experts say fine weather with good levels of sunshine this week on top of a generally mild winter have helped growers produce the early fruit			1
and with temperatures set to reach @entity132 this weekend , the arrival of the strawberries at @entity183 is a clear sign that spring is around the corner			1
traditionally , the earliest home grown strawberries come from either @entity189 , @entity190 or @entity191 but this year growers in @entity139 have won the race to produce the first			0
@entity183 berry buyer @entity195 said : ' this is a real coup for @entity139 which only began growing strawberries on a commercial scale two years ago			0
' these berries , grown in the @entity200 , near @entity201 , will put @entity139 on the @entity204 's strawberry growing map			0
' @entity205 , 29 , picks the first strawberries of the year at @entity207 in @entity139 thanks to milder winters in recent years , @entity210 on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons the variety of the @entity139 - grown strawberries is called @entity217 's @entity216 and has been selected because of its consistent , sweet taste			1
thanks to milder winters recently , @entity210 on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons			2
the @entity210 strawberry season can now last for up to nine months - a whole four months longer than last decade years ago when winters were longer and harsher			0
ms @entity195 added : ' the arrival of the first home grown strawberries brings about a real feel good factor - not only does it herald the start of @entity210 summer time but it is also the start of the @entity204 produce growing season			1

parts of @entity210 expected to be warmer than @entity107 and @entity109 this weekend with temperatures soaring to 16c
today was the start of a stretch of increasingly warm spring weather that is expected to peak on saturday
the warm temperatures will be six degrees higher than average and have been *bettered* only once so far this year
