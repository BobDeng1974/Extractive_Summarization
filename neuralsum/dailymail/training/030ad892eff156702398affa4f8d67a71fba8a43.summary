by @entity0 published : 08:19 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 08:21 est , 10 june 2013 financial advisor @entity1 , 54 , was removed as a trustee of his father 's estate after a family inheritance row left him facing his mother and sister across @entity9 's @entity8 a bid by a multi-millionaire businessman to avoid his family having to pay inheritance tax ended in court after his widow and children became involved in a bitter dispute over the legacy			1
when manufacturing tycoon @entity19 died aged 78 , he left personal assets including his £ 2.3m business empire in the @entity23 and a country home in @entity26 worth more than £ 1m			1
mr @entity1 had set up a family trust in a bid to pass on his fortune to wife @entity30 , 79 , son @entity1 , 54 , daughter @entity31 , 47 , and his six grandchildren in the most tax - efficient way			1
he hoped to avoid both disagreements and large tax bills with the scheme which he arranged in 2003 , six years before his death in 2009			0
but mr @entity1 's death sparked a bitter family row that ended up in @entity9 's @entity8 after his son became convinced his own mother was planning to cut him out of her will			1
mr @entity43 heard that after mr @entity1 's death the family home , @entity45 , near @entity46 , @entity26 , went to his widow			1
the £ 2.3m fruits of his business empire , @entity49 , went into the family trust to be split four ways between his widow , his two children , and his grandchildren by his eldest child @entity54 , who had predeceased him			0
mrs @entity55 and her two children were all appointed trustees of the fund from which they were to benefit , along with the family accountant			1
the younger mr @entity1 , a financial advisor from @entity61 , and his sister @entity55 , who runs a @entity9 - based marketing agency , were both paid out their quarter shares of the fund shortly after their father died			1
however , the court heard that a ' long - standing animosity ' between the mother and her middle child exploded into a series of disagreements at trustee meetings , as mr @entity1 ’s suspicions grew that his mother was planning to cut him out of her will			1
he demanded sight of the will , despite her denials , and his suspicions grew after she refused to let him see it			0
the court heard that the younger mr @entity1 , acting ' out of ' spite and resentment ' in his role as one of his father 's trustees , refused to agree to his mother being paid her £ 500,000 cut of her late husband 's money , and blocked attempts by the other trustees to hand her the cash			1
the tycoon 's widow @entity97 , 79 , left , and their daughter @entity55 , 47 , right , outside @entity9 's @entity8 @entity103 , for @entity101 and @entity102 , asked the court to remove mr @entity1 as a trustee , opening the path for his mother ’s share to be released			1
he denied mr @entity1 ’s claims that he was refusing to release the money to his mother to protect the fund , saying : ' the real reason why @entity1 did n’t want his mother to receive any money was because he thinks she has rewritten her will and cut him out			2
' he therefore wants to maximise his own inheritance by getting as much out of the trust himself			0
' he is motivated out of spite and [ is ] not acting in his capacity as a trustee and depriving his mother of her beneficiary right			2
' @entity1 has acted in an improper , capricious and non-genuine manner out of spite and in consideration of his own interests			2
' he is acting in a perverse fashion			0
this is spite and resentment for his perception that he has been cut out of his mother ’s will			0
@entity133 's £ 1m family home in @entity46 , @entity26 , was left to his widow , 79 - year - old @entity97 ' it seems that there has been a falling out between mother and son which has clouded @entity1 ’s judgment			1
how @entity30 might bequeath her estate has no bearing on how it should be distributed to her , ' the barrister added			2
@entity145 , for mr @entity1 , denied there were any improper motives behind his actions , saying he was acting merely to preserve the funds in the trust			0
' mrs @entity55 ’s personal circumstances do not warrant the payment out to her , ' she added			1
mr @entity43 , whilst making no findings of bad faith against mr @entity1 , handed victory to his mother and sister last friday , ordering that he be removed as a trustee			1
the judge said : ' i consider that @entity1 has allowed himself to become unduly influenced by his concern over @entity30 ’s will			1
' @entity1 has allowed his judgment as a trustee to become clouded by matters which are not relevant to the exercise of his duties as a trustee			2
the proper course for this court is to remove him			0
' the ruling means the mother ’s money will be immediately released to her , and the judge ordered mr @entity1 to pay a £ 40,000 legal costs bill			2
speaking outside court about the row between her brother and mother , miss @entity102 said : ' there was n’t one particular thing they fell out about , it ’s just a general animosity			2
' she and @entity1 have not been getting on for years			0
' she added : ' the relationship between he and i has irreparably broken down too as far as i am concerned			0
i have n’t seen his children either for at least two years			0
' on the subject of her mother ’s will , miss @entity102 said : ' i had n’t heard anything about mother leaving everything to me and i do n’t know for sure if it ’s true - her will is confidential			0
my mother is quite capable of leaving everything to charity , but i would support her in that if she did			0
' miss @entity102 added : ' my father would have turned in his grave if he knew [ what would happen ]			0

the family of tycoon @entity19 fell out over his legacy after he died
son @entity1 , 54 , blocked his mother @entity30 , 79 , getting her share of legacy
mrs @entity55 and her daughter @entity31 , 47 , went to court to remove him as trustee
