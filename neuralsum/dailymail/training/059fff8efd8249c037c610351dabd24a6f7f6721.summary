the @entity2 recording showing two @entity4 men held hostage by militants may have been filmed in separate locations before being combined into a single video , experts claim			1
inconsistencies with the shadows of @entity11 , fellow captive @entity12 and the masked killer known as @entity14 suggest images of the hostages were recorded separately and then added together for greater effect			1
other tell - tale signs include the jumpsuits worn by the two men - they are slightly different shades of orange and do n't flutter in the wind at the same time			2
mr @entity12 and fellow @entity4 national @entity36 appeared in the video , released earlier this week , in which they were threatened with death unless $ 200million was paid within 72 hours			1
in the video , mr @entity41 and mr @entity12 sit kneeling on either side of @entity14			1
but the shadows of the militant , mr @entity12 and mr @entity41 lean in different directions			1
and perhaps most tellingly , the shadows of the hostages ' heads are cast down onto opposite sides of their necks			2
both examples indicate there may have been different light sources used for filming the men separately , then adding them together for a more intimidating video			2
@entity57 , an associate professor at @entity58 and image technology expert , said : ' it 's possible that video images taken at different times were combined			1
' a very high level of knowledge and skill would be necessary to make such a composite video , ' the @entity63 reported , according to @entity68			0
@entity69 , a @entity70 professor on information - communication engineering , added it was possible that the images were recorded in different places after noting the jumpsuits were different shades of orange and did n't flutter in the wind at the same time			0

@entity106 has ordered his government to make every effort to secure their safe release , setting off a flurry of activity among @entity4 diplomats			1
the captor in the video , which resembles those showing previous @entity2 captives who were beheaded , says the ransom demand matches the $ 200 million in aid that @entity106 pledged to help countries fighting @entity145 militants			1
@entity106 made the pledge during a multi-nation visit to the @entity148 earlier this week			0

as we make utmost efforts for their swift release , we are negotiating through all available channels			0
' @entity4 officials have declined to say if they would pay any ransom , a move that would put @entity172 at odds with close ally the @entity188			2
prior to the video 's release , @entity4 diplomats had told the families of the two captives that the government would not pay ransom , sources familiar with the matter said			1
@entity172 's most prominent mosque , the @entity199 and @entity198 , posted a statement calling for the prompt release of the hostages			2
it said @entity31 's actions are ' totally against @entity96 and have a serious impact on @entity207 communities all over the world and put @entity207 in a precarious position '			2
@entity106 's handling of the hostage crisis - he must appear firm but not callous - will be a big test for the 60 - year - old , but he appears to have few options			0
@entity41 , aged around 42 and who dreamed of becoming a military contractor , was captured in august outside the @entity152 city of @entity219			0

' he left a very young baby and left his family and i asked his wife why he made this decision and she said he had to do everything in his power to save his friend and acquaintance and that it was very important to him , ' said his mother			0
meanwhile , @entity4 's government considered whether it had the legal basis for a military strike on @entity31 militants and concluded it did not , as officials scrambled to seek the release of its two nationals			1
@entity4 's pacifist constitution bans its troops from fighting overseas			2
however , mr @entity106 is trying to ease curbs on exercising the right of collective self - defence , or militarily aiding an ally under attack , in a reinterpretation of the constitution that must now be passed into law			2
prayers have been offered at @entity172 's largest mosque as the status of the men remains unclear			0
