by @entity0 published : 10:41 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 10:41 est , 22 may 2012 an aspiring teen football coach and his 18 - year - old accomplice who videoed their sexual assault on a ' vulnerable ' drunk 14 - year - old girl have been jailed for just three years each			1
@entity6 , 17 , and @entity7 , 18 , abused the young teenage girl when she was in a ' drunken stupour ' at a @entity10 in @entity11 this year			1
@entity7 , then 17 , had intercourse with the girl , despite her being ' clearly unconscious ' , while @entity14 photographed the incident on his mobile phone as the pair'clearly enjoyed ' the abuse			1
abusers : @entity6 , 17 , left , and @entity7 , 18 , right , carried out the sexual abuse on the 14 - year - old girl despite her being ' clearly unconscious ' a judge told the pair they ' chose to ignore the standards of morality ' in abusing the girl by laughing and posing as they recorded the sexual assault			1
@entity14 was even said to have threatened to to post the photos of the incident on the internet , @entity11 @entity29 heard			2
the duo are able to be identified after @entity34 ruled there should be no reporting restrictions on their names because they are ' not children but young men '			1
police only became aware of the ' horrible ' abuse when the victim told a teacher at her school what had happened			2
@entity7 and @entity14 both from @entity11 , admitted sexual activity with a child , sexual assault and taking indecent photos of a child and were each sentenced to three years and four months			1
judge @entity52 allowed identification of @entity14 and @entity7 after ruling they were ' young men , not children ' both will be on the sex offenders ’ register indefinitely			1
lawyers for @entity14 applied for a court order banning him from being publicly identified as he is under 18			2
but judge @entity34 , 58 , refused and told the boys : ' you both knew the girl was clearly under the influence of alcohol and was vulnerable and a non custodial sentence would be wholly against the interests of justice			2
' you are not children			2
you chose to ignore standards of morality and the law and to commit these offences			0
' earlier @entity73 , prosecuting , said the offences took place at a house in @entity11 on january 1 this year			0
@entity14 and @entity7 got into bed and asked the victim to get in with them			1
she was wearing clothes at that point and the teenagers started to undress her			0
the prosecutor said : ' she puts herself as very , very , very drunk at this point			0
' @entity14 then performed a sex act on the girl and @entity7 had sex with her			1
at this point the girl became aware @entity14 was taking photographs			0
one of the pictures was a level 4 indecent picture - just one below the most serious level - and showed @entity7 having sex with the schoolgirl			1
three others were taken later and showed the boys showing off their private parts and ' a young woman who is plainly unconscious			1
' in mitigation for @entity7 , defence counsel @entity100 said alcohol was not used by either defendant to facilitate the offence			1
the barrister continued : ' his actions in the early hours of jan 1 this year were , and indeed are , wholly out of character for this young man			2
' he will now have to face his punishment for his disgraceful and serious behaviour over that short period of time			0
' this was a one - off offence , a bad and serious offence , an offence which will mean he loses his liberty , but the sentence could be kept as short as possible			0
his parents are devastated at their son ’s behaviour			0
' @entity11 @entity29 heard @entity14 and @entity7 ' both knew the girl was under the influence of alcohol and vulnerable ' @entity123 , defending @entity14 , said : ' this is wholly and exceptionally out of character for him			1
' there is no real explanation for what happened			0
it was horrible , he is sorry for what he has done			0
he can not turn back the clock			0
he can not put it right			0
' mr @entity123 said character references spoke of @entity14 as being ' kind and generous ’			0
he had wanted to be a football coach , but that would not now happen .			0
