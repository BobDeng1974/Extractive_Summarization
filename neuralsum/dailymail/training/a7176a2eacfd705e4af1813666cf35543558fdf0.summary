by @entity0 in @entity1 @entity2 : 07:47 est , 30 december 2013 @entity3 : 08:58 est , 30 december 2013 football fans trying to avoid the rip - off prices being charged by hotels during @entity8 ’s @entity7 next june are booking into @entity1 ’s notorious favelas amid reports of an alarming increase in crime rates in the city			1
the hillside communities , which are home to some of the poorest families in @entity1 , have a history of violent crime and drug trafficking			1
but some are offering accommodation deals enviable for their breathtaking views from their elevated locations , near - to - the - beach convenience and budget - conscious prices of at least a third of the £ 300 a night average price being charged by hotels during the @entity32 games			1
room with a shanty town view : @entity36 as seen from the @entity37 in @entity36 , the largest favela in @entity8 , a recent escalation in shootouts between rival drug gangs and the police since november , following the arrest of 25 officers for the alleged murder of a resident , @entity45 , has not prevented supporters from booking into the @entity47			2
situated right at the top of the shanty - town and offering a stunning panorama of hundreds of pastel painted brick and wooden houses built haphazardly on the side of the mountain , the @entity37 is a family concern with two guest rooms : a mixed dorm offering six beds with an outside shared bathroom and a two bed en - suite			1
‘ we are already booked out for the @entity7			1
we have people coming from the @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
some will stay for a day , for a week or a fortnight , ’ revealed 18 - year - old @entity63 , who manages the guesthouse with his mother , @entity65 , 56			1
the @entity37 : pictured left is the outside of the accommodation and right is a shot of a mixed - dorm room for six people decor : the @entity37 comes with graffiti on the bedroom walls @entity63 , who was born in @entity36 , says the hillside slum is a safe place so long as tourists do n’t take unnecessary risks			1
in may this year , a @entity88 tourist was shot in an alley and seriously wounded in the stomach while visiting the slum with a friend , without a guide			1
crime figures released this month by @entity8 ’s @entity95 ( @entity96 ) for @entity1 indicate a worrying increase in murders , robberies and rapes in the city just months before the @entity7 kicks off			1
in the @entity96 research comparing september this year to september 2012 , murders in the capital grew by 17.5 per cent from 97 cases to 114			1
there were 409 cases of thefts against 191 , a jump of 114 per cent and reported rapes rose from 150 to 179 , an increase of 19 per cent			1
’ there are dangerous places in @entity36 because the drug dealing still goes on even though we have a large police presence operating here			2
the trouble is @entity36 is too big to be controlled by the police and so crime still happens , ’ @entity63 explained matter - of - factly			1
hosts : @entity65 and @entity121 , who run the @entity37 ‘ i always tell our guests to stay on the main street			2
do n’t go wandering into the warren - like alleyways without a guide			2
@entity36 is huge and it ’s very easy to get lost and put yourself in danger , ’ he @entity123 advice warns that : ‘ all favelas are unpredictably dangerous areas			2
violence ... can occur at anytime			2
’ ironically , a survey by the @entity96 marking five years this month since the first @entity138 , or @entity139 , was installed in @entity140 , found that in 18 out of the 36 pacified favelas , where 252,500 people live , there were 8.7 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants			0
this makes a number of the shanty - towns , not including @entity36 , some of the safest places to live as the figure represents less than half the average murder rate in the country , which is 24.3 per 100 thousand			0
dangerous : the violent @entity36 ( left ) is rabbit warren of alleyways and it 's easy to get lost			1
pictured right is the @entity158 in the @entity160 favela @entity161 , 44 , runs the 24 - bed @entity162 in @entity163 , a shanty - town in @entity164 in the south zone of @entity1			1
‘ our favela is very peaceful			0
you do n’t see any armed drug dealers walking around anymore			0
i have lived here nearly all my life and since the arrival of the @entity139 , i can sincerely tell my guests that they are safe walking here late at night and early in the morning			0
’ @entity176 , 32 , is hoping for record bookings from football fans in june at her @entity179 in the @entity160 favela			0
‘ the money from our guests contributes to the sustainability of our community project which runs educational courses and football classes for the youngsters in the favela , ’ explained @entity180			0
@entity161 looks out from her multi-coloured @entity188 in @entity163 ‘ whoever comes to stay in our @entity47 is not just getting a good deal and an amazing experience , but they are giving something back to the community as well , ’ she added			0
her accommodation can be found on the @entity8 apartment and room rental website @entity200 , which was set up by @entity69 - born @entity201 a year ago			1
the site offers a budget conscious choice of hundreds of beds in @entity1 ’s favelas			1
‘ we have different levels of accommodation so our prices vary according to the property , ’ @entity201 explained			2
‘ a single bed per night in the @entity47 is £ 30 a night , but in the nearby @entity160 favela we have a studio apartment en - suite with five beds , next to the beach for £ 90 a night per person			0
all come with breakfast and a laundry service , ’ he said			0
‘ people often come to a favela with low expectations , they imagine it to be squalid and dingy but they are pleasantly surprised when they arrive			0
favelas have a higher level of comfort than many outsiders expect , ’ argued @entity201			0
@entity230 , a 36 - year - old teacher from @entity231 is staying at the @entity47 for the second time in two years			2
‘ the community is so vibrant and full of women and children and people who work very hard			0
the criminal element is not representative of the people here , ’ @entity230 observed			0
‘ it ’s a densely packed place			0
there are people everywhere , there ’s light everywhere and there ’s sound everywhere			0
i feel part of a close - knit community and i feel safe here , ’ she added .			0
