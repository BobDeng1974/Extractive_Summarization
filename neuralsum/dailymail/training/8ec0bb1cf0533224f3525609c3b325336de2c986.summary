by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity4 commissioner @entity3 has told @entity5 he would be interested in trialling @entity7 's video referral system proposal in @entity8 as the idea is music to his ears			1
@entity7 wants to give managers the ability to challenge referee 's calls during stops in play if they feel a decision was unfair			1
managers will be able to watch an incident with the referee on an off - pitch monitor before the official decides if a decision should be overturned or not			2
@entity7 's idea has been given the thumbs up by @entity4 commissioner @entity3 the @entity4 could be the first to use a video referral system if @entity7 's referral system is ratified by @entity5 commissioner @entity3 , far left , is keen on trialling @entity7 's proposal in the @entity4 the @entity4 were unable to introduce goal - line technology as they did not have the relevant funding @entity7 's proposal has been given the thumbs up by @entity3 who has put the @entity4 forward to act as a guinea pig to test the @entity5 president 's latest idea			1
@entity3 , speaking to @entity38 , said of using video technology to review decisions : ' [ it is ] music to my ears			1
i would love to be able to do that			2
[ @entity4 deputy commissioner ] @entity47 was out in @entity48 at a meeting last week [ at @entity5 headquarters ] and let folks in @entity48 know that we ’d be happy to work with them to be that league			1
' i do n’t know what their plans are to experiment with that , but i believe the time has come for there to be a mechanism so that games are not determined by [ referee calls ] that are not right			0
' the @entity4 were previously keen on introducing goal - line technology however the league later said the system was out of their budget			1
how should it work ? @entity7 ’s system will require a coach / manager to inform the fourth official that they are requesting a decision to be reviewed , rather like a tennis player or cricket captain does with @entity77			1
at the next stoppage in play the fourth official would tell the referee who would then look at a replay of the incident			0
if there is a clear error then he will overturn his decision , if not it will stand			0
how many referrals per team / half / match ? this is to be confirmed but i would expect no more than two challenges per team and possibly only one per half			0
if the challenge proves to be correct then the coach will retain this challenge but if the referee was right then the challenge will have been used			2
when will it be used ? penalties – both those given and those not given , often when simulation is involved			0
the issue with that appeal is the call is often subjective and replays are ambiguous and open to interpretation			0
offside calls that are clearly wrong can be challenged and corrected but only those leading to goals			0
these happen infrequently as @entity113 assistants are so good but the @entity116 - @entity115 game last month would be one which would have benefitted from such legislation			0
finally red card tackles and off - the - ball incidents could also benefit from referees reviewing replays but these might not be covered by this proposal			2

the @entity5 president is keen on introducing a system which would allow managers to challenge decisions
@entity4 commissioner @entity3 is keen on trialling the proposal in @entity8
@entity3 's deputy @entity47 has told @entity5 the @entity4 are keen on testing @entity7 's proposal
