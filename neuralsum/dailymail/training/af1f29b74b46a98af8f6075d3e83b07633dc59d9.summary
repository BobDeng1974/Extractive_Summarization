a man who can not put on weight yet suffers with type 2 diabetes has finally discovered what is wrong with him			1
scientists have diagnosed @entity5 , one of @entity7 's leading para-athletes , with @entity9 syndrome - a condition caused by a single genetic mutation but is responsible for a variety of seemingly unrelated problems			1
@entity5 , 23 , was born at normal weight , but throughout his childhood and teenage years lost all the fat around his face and limbs			1
his condition means he has no natural cushioning on his body , suffers from sore feet , and is at an increased risk of breaking bones in a fall			2
it is this that has led to him developing diabetes			2
his hearing also deteriorated during childhood , and he now wears hearing aids			0
@entity5 hopes the new diagnosis will allow him to be more accurately classified for events and help his chances of success			1
he is bidding to participate in the @entity46			0
@entity9 syndrome is an extremely rare and complex condition and is only known to affect eight people in the world			1
he and other patients were found to have an abnormality in the @entity54 gene that gives rise to a defective enzyme crucial to dna replication			0
he said : ' in some ways , identifying the syndrome behind my symptoms should n't be important - a name is just a name , after all - but it is reassuring to know that there are other people with the condition and that we can lead relatively normal lives , ' he said			2
' what could prove crucial , though , is enabling me to be properly classified in competitions so that i am not competing at an unfair disadvantage against others			0
' i hope to be able to compete for @entity7 in the 2016 paralympics and this finding could make a real difference to my chances			0
' scientists describe the research that led to @entity5 's diagnosis in the journal @entity80			1
researchers at the @entity82 , where @entity5 studied law , compared the cyclist 's entire genetic code with that of three other patients with the same symptoms			1
the dna of their family members was also analysed			0
professor @entity91 , a @entity92 senior investigator at the university 's medical school , said : ' @entity96 condition has been a puzzle to us for many years			0
we could see the symptoms , including the very unusual case of type 2 diabetes in someone with no obvious body fat , but did not know what was causing them			1
@entity5 , a paralympic cyclist , hopes that the new diagnosis will help him be more accurately assessed for his place in the 2016 @entity108 ' we had to look at 30 million base pairs ( chemical components of @entity89 ) in @entity5 's dna , and similar numbers in his family members and other patients , to identify the single mutation			1
this would not have been feasible even a couple of years ago			0
' in 2011 , @entity5 became the youngest solo cyclist to be @entity119			2
@entity120 , head of genetic and molecular sciences at the @entity92 , said : ' this is a great example of genome sequencing coming of age			0
' where previously sequencing a patient 's entire genome was prohibitively expensive , it is now far more cost effective			0
' as we 've seen here , it is no longer just about identifying genes implicated in common diseases , but is about informing diagnoses and prognoses of rare diseases - and , in @entity5 's case , helping inform his sporting performance			2

@entity140 cyclist @entity5 , 23 , has been diagnosed with @entity9 syndrome , a disease thought to affect just eight people in the world
it is caused by a single gene mutation which triggers seemingly unrelated conditions including weight loss , type 2 diabetes and fused bones
hopes diagnosis will help him be better classified for 2016 @entity108
