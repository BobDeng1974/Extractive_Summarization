long gone are the days of scratching posts and balls of wooll ; the latest must - have cat accessory is a lifelike robotic mouse			0
@entity5 , the smart device is the first robotic cat toy that can see and react to a feline ’s movements just like real prey			2
and finished models of the device will use artificial intelligence to learn about a cat ’s behaviour			2
sensors built along the sides and top of the @entity27 ( pictured ) recognise ‘ external forces ’ such as a cat ’s paw ‘ keeping cats as pets indoors is only a recent trend , ’ said the @entity32 - based developers from @entity33			1
‘ as such , domestic cats have maintained their natural hunting instincts , but lack a proper outlet to express them			0
’ that ’s where @entity5 comes in			0
the robotic toy uses artificial intelligence to learn and react to a cat ’s behaviour , in the same way a mouse of bird would , for example			1

‘ we really wanted @entity5 to be as small and fast as possible , but we also wanted him to have personality			0
‘ we have been working with several designers and engineers with a lot of experience in order to ensure @entity5 ’s industrial design will be able to handle all our physical and technological requirements while remaining sleek and cute			0
’ the team said that to to give @entity5 the kind of intelligence it needs to outsmart a cat requires in - depth knowledge of signal processing and artificial intelligence			2
‘ the nuances of his intelligence using his unique vision system have n't been implemented yet , ' contuned the developers			0
' but our team ’s 14 years of combined experience in digital signal processing , low - power systems , and 3d audio localisation make us the best team for giving @entity5 the intelligence he needs to truly challenge your cat			2
