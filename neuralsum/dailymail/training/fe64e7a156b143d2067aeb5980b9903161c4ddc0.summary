by @entity0 @entity1 believes he can get his game back in shape in time to launch a challenge to win his fourth @entity5 in @entity6 at @entity7 next month			1
the 38 - year - old looked nothing like the player who dominated world golf for more than a decade as he made his comeback after three months out following spinal surgery on thursday and friday			1
rounds of 74 and 75 saw him miss the cut in the @entity18 ’s @entity17 event at @entity19 by four shots with only 13 players below him on the halfway leaderboard			1
‘ the back is in the past , ’ he said			0
‘ you know , i had no setbacks , no pain but i made a ton of simple little mistakes , misjudging things and missing the hole on the wrong sides and just did n’t get up and down on little simple shots			0
those are the things i can correct for the @entity40			0
’ apart from saying he would be taking his two children away this week on a summer holiday , @entity1 gave no details of his preparations for returning to @entity7 , where he won the last of his three @entity45 in 2006			1
his name does not appear on the entry lists for either the @entity48 in @entity49 or the @entity50 at @entity51 the week before golf ’s third major of the year			0
and as yet , @entity1 ’ management team has not contacted @entity55 to make available their facilities which he has used in the past to hone his links skills before @entity6			2
but @entity1 is definitely looking forward to going back and playing on the @entity60			2
he said : ‘ i ’m very excited to play that golf course again			0
’ rough patch : @entity1 admits he 's made mistakes but says ' those are the things i can correct for the @entity40 '			2
