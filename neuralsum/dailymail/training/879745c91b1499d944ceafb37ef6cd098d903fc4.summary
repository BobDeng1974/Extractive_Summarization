by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 21 june 2013 failing to see the funny side : @entity2 had to slope off stage early after being heckled about his tax avoidance at a charity gig in @entity7 last night @entity2 was forced to cut short his stand - up routine at a charity event after being mercilessly heckled over tax avoidance			1
the 40 - year - old was headline act but while comedians further down the bill at the @entity15 in east @entity7 got a warm welcome , @entity2 was greeted by a heckler shouting ‘ pay your taxes ’ as soon as he took to the stage			1
he announced that he would tell 50 jokes but soon faced further tax - related taunts and other heckles including ‘ you ’re not one of us ’ and ‘ you ’re not wanted here ’			1
he ended up abandoning much of his intended act – and sang a @entity29 hit instead			1
@entity2 was criticised by the prime minister last year when his use of a controversial @entity33 - based tax scheme was revealed			1
he subsequently joked that he knew he was in trouble ‘ when @entity35 broke off a meeting with @entity37 [ @entity39 president ] to say “ @entity2 is a d * * * ”			1
’ @entity2 used @entity41 to apologise for sheltering millions of pounds from tax using an avoidance scheme called @entity44			2
he admitted at the time that he had made a ‘ terrible error of judgment ’ but had left the scheme and would ‘ in future conduct my financial affairs more responsibly ’			2
at thursday ’s launch of @entity51 , a charity to defend education in the arts and provide mentoring for underprivileged students , @entity2 said he thought it would be nice to do a gig for a ‘ great cause ’			0
as the heckling continued , he asked for audience members who did not like his act to allow others to enjoy it but he got no respite			0
a male member of the crowd said @entity2 used to be funny around a decade ago , leading @entity2 to brand him ‘ a hipster who only likes the early stuff ’			0
eventually @entity2 was given advice from off - stage that he did not have much time left despite having told only a fraction of the 50 jokes he had on a clipboard			0
the star said he would tell one more to try to leave on a good note but as he looked through his list , an audience member demanded ‘ sing us a song ’			0
@entity2 finally found himself in tune with the crowd as he launched into @entity83 by @entity29 and had many of them singing along with him			2
flustered : comedian and compere for the night @entity88 seemed shocked as she came on after @entity2			0
