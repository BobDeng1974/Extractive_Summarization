volatile volcano @entity0 has been blowing perfect ' smoke ' rings into @entity4 's blue skies			1
the volcano erupted violently on november 11 and since then has produced regular explosions , as well as hundreds of perfect vortex rings			1
while theories abound , scientists are not entirely sure why the volcano is able to blow the circular puffs of steam - although some think a circular vent could be the cause			2
@entity23 volcanologist dr @entity22 , who founded the volcano watching website and runs tours of active volcanoes , said dozens of smoke rings were blown eastwards by a strong wind			1
he believes the reason for the unusual smoke - like formations is because the violent eruption had changed the structure of a vent – perhaps into a particularly circular shape that allowed the volcano to make the steam rings , which he said are a ‘ rare phenomenon '			1
writing on the website , he said : ‘ @entity41 , she exaggerates : not only one ring every now and then , but she made dozens if not hundreds during a few hours , often in a row			0
’ in 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings , two volcanologists , said they could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere			2
more recent rings are pictured volatile volcano @entity0 has been blowing perfect smoke rings after erupting violently on november 11 and has since produced regular explosions , as well as dozens of perfect vortex rings it is not the first time that @entity0 has managed to produce the circular smoke rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000			1
@entity0 is the tallest and most active volcano in @entity61 and is situated on the geological boundary where the @entity61 and @entity64 plates collide			2
in 2,000 when the volcano produced another series of impressive rings , two volcanologists , @entity68 and @entity69 , told the @entity70 : ‘ they [ the rings ] could be formed by rapid gas pulses emitted by narrow vents into the atmosphere			0
‘ the physics seems somewhat complicated and we are trying to establish if there are sound scientific theories about them			0
’ the pair run a monitoring station and keep a photographic record of the volcano ’s activity			0
other experts have theories about why the rings of steam are produced			0
it is not the first time that @entity0 has managed to produce the circular steam rings and photographs have been taken of them since the 1970s and notably in the year 2000			1
here , it is possible to see the steam rings above the volcano @entity23 volcanologist dr @entity22 believes the reason for the unusual smokey formations is because the violent eruption had changed the morphology of a vent writing on @entity104 blog , @entity102 said steam rings above volcanoes typically measure between 100m and 200m across			1
she said ' vortex rings ' are formed when air mixes with steam or smoke , having been forced out of a small circular opening			0
because there is a bottleneck at the opening , the air in the centre if forced out faster , which creates a circular motion to form a vortex			0
the shape of the ring is maintained because of the rotational motion of the air so the rings need the right shaped opening and velocity to form			0
@entity0 is not the only volcano to have created the curious rings and @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 in @entity130 and @entity131 in @entity132 are also said to have produced steam rings			1
@entity0 is an active volcano on the east coast of @entity4 , @entity128 , close to the cities of @entity136 and @entity137			1
it lies on a convergent plate margin between the @entity64 plate and the @entity140			0
it is the tallest active volcano on the @entity61 continent at 3,329m high when @entity0 started to erupt last month ( pictured ) none of the villages of @entity137 , dotted around the mountain , needed to be evacuated , though airspace over the southern @entity128 island was briefly closed more than 25 per cent of @entity4 's population lives on @entity0 's slopes , and it is the main source of income for the island - a combination of agriculture , due to its rich volcanic soil , and tourism			2
here , @entity0 is pictured erupting last month			0

the volcano in @entity4 erupted violently on november 11 and has created hundreds of smoke rings that *travelled* east
volcanologist dr @entity22 , who photographed the phenomenon , believes they were produced by a circular vent
it is not the first time @entity0 has managed to produce the smoky halos
