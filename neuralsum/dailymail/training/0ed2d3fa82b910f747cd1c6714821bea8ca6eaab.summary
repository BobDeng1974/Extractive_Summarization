by @entity0 in a few weeks it will be @entity2 ; a wonderful occasion to celebrate the women who do so much for us and the joy it is to have a child			1
at this time of year , my mind also goes to the many lovely and amazing women i know who are currently working very hard to become a mother themselves			2
and so , in advance of this lovely occasion , i would like to take this moment to encourage you			2
in fact , there is lots of good news out there – and things are only getting better			2
a new treatment coming to the @entity25 is said to be just as effective as ivf but for a fraction of the price first and foremost , @entity26 is getting less invasive and less expensive			1
a ‘ no frills treatment costing under £ 1,000 will be available to @entity25 women within weeks			1
despite its low - tech approach , a pilot study showed the treatment to be at least as effective as traditional @entity26 , and a hell of a lot less pricey			1
further in the good news category , dr @entity36 , of the @entity38 foundation , who is bringing the procedure to @entity25 , believes it will allow the @entity42 to pay for more ivf treatments			1
and in terms of the risk to your health , many fertility clinics are now offering a ‘ kinder , gentler ’ @entity51 as ‘ minimal stimulation ’ @entity26 , it uses fewer , and milder drugs and requires less frequent trips to the @entity55			1
it ’s also something like 50 per cent to 60 per cent cheaper than a full stimulation cycle			1
it uses milder injectables , oral drugs or a combination of both			2
this @entity2 , @entity0 wants to remember all the women who are still trying to have a baby you get fewer eggs each cycle , but it ’s more patient - friendly , less costly and with lower risk to the patient ; experts say it ’s a great alternative for older women , who produce fewer eggs anyway in response to drugs , regardless of the dose			1
and there are hundreds of really encouraging case studies			2
in this week ’s @entity83 , real life mum - to be @entity81 , a 35 - year - old nurse living in @entity82 , recounts how she spent around $ 25,000 for the single cycle of conventional ivf that produced her and her husband ’s first child			1
when the couple wanted a second , ' financially , going through another cycle was not feasible , ' she told the paper			2
she also experienced ovarian overstimulation that put her in the hospital when she went through @entity26			1
' i could not put my body through that again , ' she said			2
she heard about minimal - stimulation @entity26 from her @entity96 and did one cycle at the @entity99 location of @entity26			1
her cost this time : $ 5,000			0
she is currently eight months pregnant with her second child			0
and whilst women in their 30s or 40s are frequently harangued about the odds of delivering a baby with birth defects , new research suggests that the opposite may be true in certain cases			0
in the new research , second - trimester ultrasounds for more than 76,000 women showed that older mothers ( 35 and over ) were 40 per cent less likely to have a child with major congenital malformations			0
and despite alarming headlines to the contrary , if you are contemplating @entity26 , the biggest comparative study of its type in the world just found that young adults who were conceived through @entity26 have similar health patterns and success at school as those who were conceived naturally			1
and be assured , new advances mean you may not have to go through ivf at all			0
there are currently advances in fertility acupuncture , diet and lifestyle research that can all work together to help you conceive			0
fertilty expert @entity133 who runs @entity135 ’s @entity134 and is author of @entity137 sees many of her fertility acupuncture patients become pregnant			2
she has had great success with an integrated approach – looking at diet , acupuncture , lifestyle , even happiness levels , and the effect that they have on fertility			0
she was the woman i went to who offered me hope and positive thinking at a time when it was much needed			0
' things are looking good for couples wanting to have a baby ; @entity26 is improving all the time and there are more options available to ( hopefully ) reduce the amount of @entity26 cycles couples do			1
' this new method of @entity26 is said to be far less invasive than current treatments available the @entity164 author adds , ' the endometrial scratch , prior to transfer , is a relatively non invasive procedure and @entity167 is a non-invasive method for selecting the best sperm : both show promise			1
we are seeing over 100 couples every year looking for lifestyle or acupuncture support during or as preparation for @entity26			1
many couples conceive naturally while waiting to start which is always a lovely surprise			0
' and there are great advances being made in the field of male fertility as well			0
clinical scientist dr @entity182 operates the only @entity183 licensed @entity25 fertility clinic dedicated entirely to men			0
( www.andrologysolutions.co.uk ) she says : ‘ having worked in academia and then at @entity26 clinics , it struck me how marginalised the male side of things is			1
in this country , 95 per cent of @entity26 clinics , ( or more ) are run by gynaecologists			1
and yet 50 per cent of the genetic material that makes up a baby is derived from the male			2
why are we so obsessed with women and fertility ? ' she help couples get pregnant without having to go down the @entity26 route			1
she cautions : ' if faced with an unexplained infertility diagnosis - do n’t go straight to @entity26			1
infertility is unexplained in around 25 per cent of cases			0
' however , there is now good evidence to suggest that sperm dna damage and oxidative stress in semen may be significant factors contributing to unexplained infertility cases - and the good news is that there are now tests available to assess both of these factors			0
' diet , acupuncture , lifestyle , and even happiness levels , can affect fertility success			0
medical director at the @entity223 and at @entity135 and in @entity224 , @entity221 concurs that there is reason to be optimistic for women trying to become pregnant			0
‘ the techniques that we ’ve been doing are getting better , and by using an integrated approach , addressing lifestyle and relationships at the same time , we are getting higher rates of success			0
' the @entity235 adds , ‘ solid evidence - based good help is available and success is improving			0
we have seen advances in egg storage for younger women who are thinking of delaying pregnancy , and egg donation is becoming more available and more acceptable			0
we also have more information about how to improve success rates of embryo and egg freezing			0
’ @entity247 recently wrote , speaking about @entity26 : ' i dislike the way the term “ miracle ” ( as in “ miracle baby ” or “ miracle procedure ” ) is used … what happens when a cycle fails and a patient thinks , ” maybe i do n’t deserve the miracle ? ” ' if a patient believes that the outcome of an ivf cycle is a miracle , and is therefore not based in very real and very limiting probabilities , then she is going to very naturally feel that the outcome will reflect whether she is worthy of such a miracle or not …			1
the truth is , when @entity26 fails a patient , @entity26 has failed			2
' if you are someone who desperately wants to become a mother this year , at the very least , know that you are not alone			0
there are thousands of other women who are right there in the fight along with you , or the rest of us who stand beside you in solidarity ; there is hope .			0

@entity0 says that @entity26 is getting less invasive and less expensive
the new £ 1000 treatment will allow the @entity42 to fund more treatments
it ’s 50 **%** to 60 **%** cheaper than a full stimulation cycle
