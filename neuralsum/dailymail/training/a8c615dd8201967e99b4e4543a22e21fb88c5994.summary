senator @entity0 sacrificed the dream of a @entity2 for a far greater cause this holiday season as he flew to @entity4 to spend time with @entity7 troops serving overseas			1
the war hero 's appearance comes just days before @entity7 and @entity11 combat troops will withdraw from @entity12 after 13 years in the country			2
this as local forces in the country will now be tasked with protecting the security vacuum left in the wake of @entity7 's withdrawal from the increasingly daunting and emboldened threats of @entity21 militants			0
president @entity38 and @entity0 also both took time to praise the service of the brave men and women who helped the country over the past 13 years , with @entity38 praising them for their incredible sacrifices while @entity0 emphasized @entity7 's long - term support for the country , according to a statement released by the presidency			1
the reason for the season : even @entity53 stopped by to see the troops change4 it up : the ladies later performed for the troops in gold dresses far from home : the troops celebrated their holiday away from their families for perhaps the final time @entity2 cheer : two troops add some color to their camouflage with @entity53 hats and while many of the male , and a few of the female , troops were no doubt incredibly moved by the words of these leaders and nostalgic about their tour coming to an end , it would seem that for many the highlight of the holiday was a few sexy @entity53 dancers who entertained the troops in revealing red dresses that seemed to do wonders for morale .			0
