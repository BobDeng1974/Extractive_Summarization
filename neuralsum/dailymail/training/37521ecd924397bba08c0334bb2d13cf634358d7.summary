by @entity0 published : 05:37 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 18 july 2013 a girl with a rare genetic condition has finally spoken her first words thanks to a diet that involves eating four tubs of cream cheese a week			1
three - year - old @entity7 from @entity8 in @entity9 , suffers from a disorder called @entity11 , which affects her ability to speak			1
but miraculously , after starting a high - fat , low - sugar diet - which includes eating almost a kilo of @entity15 a week - she has finally spoken her first words			1
mother @entity17 , 34 , is pictured with her daughter @entity18 , who suffers from extremely rare condition called @entity11			1
it it means her brain is starved of energy because her body can not transport enough glucose to it there is no cure for @entity28 , which affects just 25 people in the @entity30 , but children can be helped with a special diet called the @entity33			1
delighted mother , @entity34 , 34 , said : ' the first time i heard fields say " @entity39 " it was just wonderful			2
' i did n't really believe that something so simple as changing her diet could make such a big difference			2
' the amount of @entity15 she goes through is a bit mad but the effect it 's had is @entity49 's just fabulous to know that she does have a voice inside her and we can finally communicate			2
' @entity18 suffers from an extremely rare syndrome called @entity11 ( @entity53 )			1
fewer than 300 cases have been reported since the disease was identified in 1991 and there are only 25 known cases in the @entity30			1
@entity53 is a genetic condition that primarily affects the brain and is caused by a defect in the @entity28 gene , which is responsible for making a protein called the glucose transporter protein type 1 ( @entity28 )			1
this protein is responsible for transporting glucose ( a simple sugar ) from the blood into the cells for energy			1
symptoms of @entity71 can be alleviated by the @entity33 which is high in fat and very low in carbohydrates			1
@entity18 's eats over a kilo of cream cheese a week and must also drink 50ml of a special oil four times a day to boost her fat intake this causes the brain to be starved of energy which can result in a variety of symptoms			1
most , but not all , patients develop seizures within the first few months of life			1
these seizures are very difficult to treat with the common anti-seizure medications			1
other symptoms include learning disabilities , stiffness , difficulty in coordinating movements , speech abnormalities , fatigue , muscle twitches and headaches			1
mother @entity34 said that at first she was dubious about the diet			2
but within weeks she said she could see it working - that @entity18 was more alert and her ' personality seemed to come out a bit more ' there is no cure for the condition but many people have reported a great reduction in symptoms from the @entity33			1
the diet is a very restrictive calorie - limited , high - fat diet			1
no sugar is allowed and minimal carbohydrate is included			1
the diet is so precise that children on it must avoid even topical ingredients – such as medications or toothpastes – that might contain sugar			1
strict compliance with this diet causes the liver to produce ketones which are used by the brain as an alternative fuel source			1
ketones are measured with a blood monitoring machine that requires pricking the child 's finger			0
ketone levels must be regularly checked because if they are too high a patient may go into a coma			1
@entity34 said : ' at first i was pretty dubious about the diet - i did n't see how food could make such a big difference			1
mother @entity34 ( pictured with husband @entity138 and daughter @entity18 ) said that after several weeks on the diet something miracualous happened			0
she said : ' one morning i was in the kitchen and all of a sudden i heard this little voice shout " mum "			0
' i dropped what i was doing and ran into the direction of @entity18 and just could n't believe what i was hearing			0
' ' but within weeks you could see it working , she was more alert and her personality seemed to come out a bit more			0
' then , one morning i was in the kitchen and all of a sudden i heard this little voice shout " mum "			0
' i dropped what i was doing and ran into the direction of @entity18 and just could n't believe what i was hearing			0
' there 's been times that i never thought i 'd hear her speak			0
i was just over the @entity159			0
@entity162 prevents glucose , the brain 's main energy source , from reaching @entity166 in effect starves the brain , leading to a number of symptoms include seizures , muscle twitches , learning disabilities and in @entity175 's cases , speech @entity160 is a very restrictive , calorie - limited , high - fat diet			1
no sugar is allowed and minimal carbohydrate is @entity180 compliance with this diet causes the liver to produce ketones			1
these ketones are then used by the brain as an alternative source of energy			1
children must be strictly monitored when on the diet because too many ketones can trigger extreme fatigue and even coma in extreme cases			1
' now she 's started shouting for the dog and saying bigger words - she said the word dinosaur the other day - i nearly cried			2
' @entity34 explained that it was difficult to get @entity18 to comply at the outset but that cream cheese has really helped make it bearable for her			2
' @entity15 really has been our saving grace - she just loves the stuff			2
she 'll pile it up on crackers and it gives her loads of energy , ' said @entity34			2
' i do get funny looks when i give her a tiny piece of toast with layers and layers of butter on but the diet has really worked wonders for her			0
' it does n't affect her weight either as she uses up every bit of fat she eats , she does n't store any of it			2
' @entity34 , and husband @entity138 , first noticed something may be wrong with their daughter when she was just 15 weeks old			0
@entity34 said : ' i 'd had a normal pregnancy and normal birth but @entity18 got to 15 weeks old and she started with a twitch in her wrist			0
' i went to the gp who said she would book us an appointment at the hospital			0
' i was just waiting in the waiting room to find out when that appointment would be and all of a sudden she had a seizure			0
your worst thoughts go through your mind			0
she just went really vacant , like she was going into another world			0
@entity18 's parents are now hoping that , thanks to the diet , her condition will improve even further			2
they went to a @entity28 conference in @entity245 last week and there were children there that were walking			2
@entity250 said : ' it 's a huge goal for fields to reach , but she 's progressed so far in such a short time			0
' fields was rushed to hospital , where she had another seizure , and further tests were carried out			0
after a week in hospital she was diagnosed with epilepsy			0
' when they told us she had epilepsy we accepted it and tried to get on with it			0
but then i started noticing that other children @entity18 ' age were doing more advanced things than she was			2
' so we told the hospital and last march she had some genetic tests done			0
' i did n't really think anything of it , and when we went back to the hospital in january this year for an appointment i just thought it was a routine check up			0
' i was gob smacked when they told us that there was deletion in one of her chromosomes , and that she had @entity28			0
i 'd never heard of it before			0
' @entity18 is now thriving thanks to the new regime which has cut out carbohydrates and massively upped her intake of fats the only way to treat the condition is by starting the @entity33 which @entity18 was put on in april			1
her parents are now hoping that , thanks to the diet , her condition will improve even further			2
@entity34 said : ' we went to a @entity28 conference in @entity245 last week and there were children there that were walking			2
' it 's a huge goal for fields to reach , but she 's progressed so far in such a short time			0
' we know she can do it			0
' @entity303 is the ceo and founder of @entity305 , a @entity306			0
@entity303 said : ' the @entity33 is really the only treatment there is for glut 1 ds and sadly there are still patients in the @entity30 that have been diagnosed with glut 1 ds that are then put on a long waiting list for the treatment - this is not acceptable as there should be no waiting list for these patients			1
' the longer they are without treatment the longer their brains are being starved and the more damage can be done			0
' @entity18 ' story just highlights the difference the correct treatment can make to a person and the @entity33 can work wonders in these patients and those with drug resistant epilepsy			1

@entity7 has a rare condition called @entity11 that affects just 25 people in the @entity30 and 300 people worldwide
condition prevents brain from getting the energy it needs and can cause seizures , speech *problems* as well as *physical* and learning disabilities
there is no cure for the syndrome but children can be helped with a special high - fat low - carbohydrate regime called the @entity33
