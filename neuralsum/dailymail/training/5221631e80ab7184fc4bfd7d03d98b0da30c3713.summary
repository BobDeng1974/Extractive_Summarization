by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 7 october 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 7 october 2013 tourists who have escaped to @entity3 for a final summer romantic break have had to swap their sandals for wellies as the city is hit with an early seasonal high tide			1
partly engulfed by the high waters , some of the city 's most iconic and romantic sites have become underwater obstacle courses for visitors			1
holding suitcases high and dry over their heads , buying emergency pairs of @entity20 boots and wading through the knee - deep water , some tourists took the challenge in their stride while others seemed less impressed			1
coping : tourists in @entity3 's @entity26 were forced to go barefoot as the water level rose unusually high for this time of year closed up : shops were closed and only the bravest visitors ventured out into the flooded streets as the tide engulfed parts of the city locals , wearing full dry - suits and prepared for the seasonal flooding , looked un-phased by the unusually high tide , going about their normal day but surrounded by water			1
the high water , known as ' acqua alta ' , usually happens between autumn and spring , but appears to have arrived early this year			1
the unusually high tides occur for a number of reasons , but primarily because of the addition of certain weather conditions coupled with the astronomical high tide caused by the alignment of the sun , moon and other planets			1
fascinated : this tourist seemed entertained by he high water level in the city , caused by a combination of astronomical tides , weather systems and @entity58 tides some seemed to take the event in their stride while others looked less impressed with the challenge @entity64 : the bad weather and unseasonably early acqua alta may have put a dampener on those hoping to grab a late summer romantic break low pressure systems in the @entity71 , to the @entity72 , and strong southerly winds , known as scirocco , are both causes for concern when tides are high during the winter months			1
the @entity58 also has it 's own oscillating tide , known as the ' @entity58 seiche '			1
while not as noticeable as the astronomical tide , when the two are in sync , the water level is likely to rise and fall further			2
since 1867 , exceptional tidal events have been recorded - the first being in 1867 itself , when the water level rose 153cm above sea level			2
locals seemed unphased by the event , donning appropriate gear to continue going about their working day since 1867 , exceptional tidal events have been recorded - the first being in 1867 itself , when the water level rose 153cm above sea level the year 1966 also saw an unprecedented acqua alta , after which the city established a dedicated service to monitor and analyse tidal data and predict when tidal flooding was likely to occur high and dry : tourists queued along a raised platform in @entity26 to take a boat to a drier part of the city , while seagulls made the most of the novel waterways bad weather in @entity3 has in part played a role in causing the unusually early acqua alta this year the year 1966 also saw an unprecedented acqua alta , after which the city established a dedicated service to monitor and analyse tidal data and predict when tidal flooding was likely to occur			1
today 's tidal flooding was short - lived however , and posed a challenge only for tourists wishing to take a coffee sat in @entity119 's square for example			1
but even that was still achievable , if visitors were happy to either get their feet wet or sport some sensible water - proof footwear			0
@entity125 : gondoliers are soon to be fitted with gps systems to monitor the speed and position of boats in the wake of calls to better regulate @entity3 's waterways they have navigated the lagoon city for hundreds of years , with only the stars and a wooden oar to steer them on their way			1
but @entity3 ’s famous gondoliers will soon be dragged into the 21st century - their boats are set are fitted with gps systems			2
the new regulatory bit of kit , which will monitor both the speed and route of the vessels , comes as part of a crackdown on water traffic following the death of a tourist on the city ’s canals			0
fifty - year old @entity154 from @entity155 died in august when the gondola he was travelling on collided with a vaporetto water bus			0
until now @entity3 has operated as something of a free for all with cruise ships speed boats and water taxis joining small craft jostling for space on the major canals			2
but following the accident on the 17th august the council have set out proposals to bring @entity3 closer in line to cities based on dry land			2
the city ’s mayor @entity170 said after the accident : ' we have to think of the @entity173 as a street , a main street like that of all cities , with particularly heavy traffic			0
' under the clampdown the gondolas will also have to have number plates like cars , and reflector strips to make them more visible to night - time traffic			0
processions of gondolas floating together to enjoy a traditional serenade will soon become a thing of the past as groups travelling together are considered a hazard			0
under proposals already announced , the city is to introduce a floating congestion zone , which would prevent the gondolas operating in the congested @entity173 before 10.30 am			0
if approved the plans will also include breathalyser tests for gondoliers and a ban on mobile phones			0
changes : @entity3 lawmakers want to bring the city 's watery transport service in line with land equivalents , following the death of a tourist travelling in a gondolier which was hit by another boat @entity213 the councillor who drew up the new regulations said ‘ we have no alternative , we can no longer pretend that problems do not exist			1
’ there was a need to cut water traffic on the most overcrowded stretches of the @entity173 by 50 per cent , he said			0
a recent study showed that in the space of just 10 hours , 1,600 vessels passed under the @entity224			0
@entity225 , the president of the gondoliers ' association , said his members had yet to sign up to all the proposals and would make their views known at a meeting this week			0
@entity232 and his family were flung into the water when their gondola collided with a vaporetto water taxi , near the famous @entity224 , one of @entity3 ’s most popular and picturesque sights			2
mr @entity154 was crushed to death			0
his three - year - old daughter was treated in hospital for head injuries , but survived .			0

@entity252 's square was engulfed , tourists were forced to wade barefoot
