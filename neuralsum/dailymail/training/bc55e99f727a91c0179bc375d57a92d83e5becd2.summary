two giant rats chose to settle scores in a @entity2 on the @entity3 on tuesday			1
the brawl was captured on video by commuter @entity6 and posted to @entity7			1
the two vermin squared off between the tracks at @entity11 subway station in @entity14 's @entity13 district			1
the no - holds - barred fight shows the law of [ urban ] jungle being enforced			2
no winner emerges , but one contender 's kickboxing skills are a force to be reckoned with			2
it is often said that @entity20 has one rat per resident , totaling 8 million , but research published in 2014 claims that is not in fact the case			2
however , the study did conclude that there are still 2 million of the rodents living in the city in analysis based on sightings on city lots			0
@entity52 , the @entity53 and @entity54 - @entity54 , all in @entity14 , are identified as having large concentrations of rat - inhabited lots			0
rats that inhabit @entity20 are all the same species : rattus norvegicus or the @entity61 rat , the same species as pet rats and laboratory rats			0
they grow to approximately 16 inches in length and weigh a pound			0
a female rat produces 4 â€“ 7 litters of around 10 rats each year			0
@entity71 : fisticuffs as the two stand tall to face off take that ! the kickboxing champion of @entity11 lands a blow , but not enough to secure victory no - holds - barred : no rules as the scuffle continues , but the questions remains - who won ?			1
