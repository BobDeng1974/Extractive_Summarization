by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 22 may 2013 updated : 07:11 est , 22 may 2013 one - eyed killer : @entity2 , 29 , today admitted the murders of father and son @entity5 and @entity6 one - eyed police killer @entity2 today admitted murdering a father and son in a gun and grenade attack			1
@entity2 , 29 , had ' bizarrely ' pleaded not guilty to killing @entity5 and @entity6 despite apparently confessing to the attacks numerous times			1
but today he changed his plea at @entity13 a t the last minute after the prosecution had delivered their closing speech to the jury			1
@entity2 also admitted causing an explosion with a hand - grenade at an address in @entity20 but denies attempting to murder the householder			1
he has previously admitted murdering @entity22 , 32 , and @entity22 , 23 , but had continued to deny killing the father and son , aged 46 and 23			1
he lured the unarmed policewomen with a bogus 999 call before using a @entity27 handgun and a military grenade to murder them in @entity29 , @entity30 on september 18 last year			0
today his barrister , @entity31 , began the day by asking six of the seven remaining counts to be put to his client			0
@entity2 then stood up and calmly pleaded guilty to the murders of @entity5 and @entity6			1
in his closing speech , mr @entity36 said that @entity2 now accepted he had killed four people			1
' members of the jury , your task is now so much more simple , ' he said			2
' you knew within a few days of this trial starting that @entity2 had killed those two policewomen			1
' you now know for sure that he has murdered four people and that he has attempted to murder others inside the @entity47 pub. ' ordinarily in a closing speech the defence barrister will tell you how important your task is , how it makes so much difference , how the liberty of the defendant hangs in the balance			0
' all of those words mean nothing now , absolutely nothing			0
' you may think after what has just happened , in a calm and almost clerical way ... you may think " what does it matter now ? " , " what difference does it make ? " , " why does @entity2 care ? "			1
murder victims : father and son @entity5 and @entity6 who @entity2 today admitted killing murdered : policewomen @entity22 and @entity22 who were lured to an address in @entity29 by @entity2 and killed while unarmed victim : @entity22 who was killed by @entity2 while responding to a 999 call ' he is going to be sentenced for four murders and three attempted murders			1
he is not going anywhere			0
he is going to die in prison			0
' mr @entity36 also told the jury that @entity2 said he was not guilty of the remaining attempted murder charge			1
he added : ' we are dealing with someone who when he sets out to kill , he kills			0
' when he set out to kill @entity6 , he killed him			2
' when he set out to kill @entity77 , he killed him			0
' when he set out to kill the police officers , he did			0
' there was never any danger of him failing to carry out those murderous objectives			0
' it is completely different with @entity83			0
' as hard as it may seem , as absurd as it may seem , the only reasonable verdict on the evidence is that you can not be sure he attempted to murder anyone at @entity83			0
so therefore your verdict should be not guilty			0
' prosecutor @entity91 had earlier said that @entity2 used the same gun and the same type of grenade to murder @entity77 as he had used in the killings of the police officers			2
' essentially it was the same way , ' he explained			0
' the surprise ambush , the hail of gunfire and the gratuitous throwing of his calling card ( the grenade )			0
' @entity105 footage of him attempting to fire a @entity27 handgun and throwing a grenade at the home of another intended victim shortly after the killing of mr @entity6 was ' the most obvious evidence against him ' , he said			1
he said it had been ' an odd murder trial ' in that the main defendant - who chose not to give evidence to the jury - had not challenged through his barrister any of the evidence in which several witnesses said @entity2 had told them he killed the shorts			1
mr @entity120 reminded the jury that he told a psychiatrist and psychologist in prison before the trial that he had killed @entity5 and @entity6 - and had even made the same confession to his mother			1
murder scene : police outside the @entity130 , @entity20 , @entity30 , where @entity6 was shot dead by @entity2 probe : forensic officers enter the home where @entity77 was murdered in @entity133 , @entity30 , last year			1
@entity2 has today changed his plea to guilty he ' talked openly ' with some of his co-accused while in custody at @entity137 in @entity30 about taking the life of @entity77 , he said			2
' the fact that he has murdered @entity77 is the worst kept secret in @entity137 , ' said mr @entity120			0
@entity2 also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , who were all in the @entity47 on may 25 last year			1
he also admitted causing an explosion at a property in @entity83 , @entity20 , on august 10 , shortly after the murder of @entity77			2
the jury foreman was then invited by trial judge mr @entity148 to formally return guilty verdicts on those counts			2
the judge then told the jurors that the defendant remained on trial for the single allegation remaining against him - that he attempted to murder @entity156 at her home in @entity83			2
grief : @entity160 officers hold a minute 's silence in @entity29 , @entity30 , following the murders of @entity22 and @entity22 respects : police officers leave flowers at the scene following the murder of @entity168 @entity22 and @entity22 the @entity47 shooting was said to have been ordered by @entity170 , 35 , from @entity171 , and that @entity2 recruited @entity172 , 27 , from @entity29 , @entity173 , 37 , from @entity174 , @entity175 , 28 , from @entity20 , and @entity176 , 33 , from @entity133 , for the task			1
they all deny the murder of @entity6 and the attempted murders of mr @entity141 , mr @entity142 and mr @entity143			1
@entity181 , 33 , from @entity182 , pleaded guilty during the trial to murdering @entity77			2
he denies one count of the attempted murder of @entity156 in @entity20 on the same day and causing an explosion with a hand - grenade			2
@entity188 , 37 , from @entity189 , and @entity190 , 24 , deny the above charges relating to @entity77 and @entity156			0
@entity192 , 23 , from @entity193 , denies assisting an offender			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

@entity2 , 29 , admits killing @entity5 and @entity6 at the last minute
jury were *due* to consider the charges at @entity13
@entity2 had ' bizarrely ' denied the murders - despite admitting to them several times before the trial
the killer has also admitted murdering *pcs* @entity22 and @entity22
