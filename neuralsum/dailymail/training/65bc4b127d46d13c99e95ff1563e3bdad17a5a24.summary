have you ever wondered what you would look like if you were a little skinnier or your nose were a little straighter ? for one photographer , wondering was n't enough			0
@entity5 has created images that explore what ordinary people would look like as their ' ideal self			2
' the photographer wanted to investigate our subconscious beauty ideals in order to display the gap between how we look and how we long to look			0
@entity5 has created his model 's ' ideal appearance ' ( right ) by manipulating their original portrait ( left ) the project , @entity20 combines portrait photography with neuroscience combining psychology , brain scans and photo shop			1
@entity5 begins by taking a portrait image of each subject			2
he told @entity28 that he looks for models who are ' facially very interesting			0
or that have interesting stories			0
a few people on are transgender			0
' the alterations vary from a change in eye size to skin tone the subjects are presented their alternative images while attached to a brain scanner after taking the original image , @entity5 creates 50 more portraits by making small adjustments using @entity45 , altering anything from the size of their eyes to the tone of their skin			1
. the subject is presented with the various versions while attached to a brain scanner which records their reactions in order to determine the version they prefer			1
some of the changes to the images were barely noticeable but in other cases the subject 's ideal appearance was unrecognisable to their first image @entity5 combined photography with neuroscience to complete his project when selecting his models @entity5 opted for those that he described as ' visually interesting ' once @entity5 has uncovered which of the images the subject has the most positive reaction to he displays it next to the original image , showcasing the contrast between the original image and the model 's ideal			1
in some of the photographs the change is barely discernible , with the smallest of tweaks - such as a slight re-positioning of the eyes - needed to make the subject satisfied with their appearance			2
however , in some cases the second portrait is completely different to the first , with a change in eye colour and size seeming to make the most noticeable change in overall appearance			0
several of @entity5 's subjects were transgender , however their identities have been kept secret the most stark contrasts appeared when the second image saw a change in eye colour and size @entity5 believes that even from a young age we still have an idea of what we would prefer to look like for this subject a change as subtle as an extended forehead was all that he sees as an improvement to himself the photographer alters the original image 50 times on @entity45 and then uses a brain - scanner to measure which image the subject reacts most positively to in this case the woman would prefer larger eyes and fuller lips			1

@entity5 has combined photography with neuroscience
he *reproduces* an original portrait of a subject 50 times on @entity45
the subject is shown the images while they are attached to a brain scanner
this measures which portrait the model finds most visually *pleasing*
