' when i told my friends and family that i was going to try and attempt to do every country they thought i was absolutely ridiculous , but are incredibly supportive , ' the half @entity10 , half @entity24 said			0
@entity13 prefers to travel by himself , as he says it is more fun because he meets a lot of people who are curious about his mission and the kilt			1
when he was recently in @entity75 , a girl grabbed him as soon as she spotted his @entity4 attire , and insisted that he play on the top of the @entity78			0
the bagpipes have also proven to be a way to get out of some sticky situations			2
when travelling in @entity43 , a police guard stopped his rented car and grilled him on why it was not registered			0
having done prior research @entity13 knew that the bagpipe was similar to the @entity43 mezoued , and ended up playing for them , to their delight , and was allowed on his way			1

these warthogs in @entity29 appear to be unperturbed by the instrument transporting the instrument is one of the hardest part of mission , the bagpiper revealed			1
as they have to be taken on planes as hand luggage , there are always confused reactions when it goes through the x-ray machine			0
' i nearly always get pulled over and asked whether it is a shisha pipe , or a weapon ! ' he said			1
when @entity13 reaches a country they are usually very receptive to his playing			1
the @entity45 police were less than impressed , however , and he was almost immediately accosted by officers			0
' they quickly silenced me , but admitted they thought it was kind of cool , ' @entity13 said			1
animals similarly seem to appreciate the bagpipe playing , and the adventurer has counted giraffes , goats , dogs and cats among his audience			1
' when i was in @entity29 at the @entity28 they were initially hesitant as to how the giraffes would react to the sound , ' he said			1
' i began playing and they actually starting marching in line , it was incredible			0
' ' there have been mixed reactions to the kilt though , ' @entity13 admitted			1

' it emerged that she had last heard the bagpipes before her husband went to fight in @entity164			0
' it is amazing how the music can bring people together , all over the world , ' he said			0

' i tend to get holidays when the school holidays fall , which is great for my travelling			0
' the musician saves from his job , and has been helped out by generous contacts he has made , and even the @entity214 and @entity216 menswear have contributed to his mission			0
although he does not tend to busk in the countries when he is playing , some people insist on paying for his performance			0
@entity49 was where he received the most donations , and he had no sooner opened his bagpipe case to take out his instrument when people were already throwing coins into his box and taking photographs			0
@entity13 ' next mission is for @entity230 in april and his travels can be followed on facebook or instagram			2
when in @entity234 : @entity13 does not just want to travel and see what he can get from a destination , but aims to give back to where he visits , and share his love for music with them on the go ! @entity13 has travelled to @entity241 in @entity56 in full outfit			2

the bagpiper always wanted to travel , but wanted to aim to do it in an unusual way @entity13 enjoys travelling alone as it means he is less threatening to people he meets , and it forces him to be sociable and step out his comfort zone			2

@entity13 has so far played in 34 countries and is aiming to take on the world
the bagpipes have been *mistaken* for shisha pipes or a weapon when being x-rayed to go on planes
