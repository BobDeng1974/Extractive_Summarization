a man who was left in a @entity3 @entity2 's sink when he was just hours old has launched a search for his birth mother after being inspired by the success of the ' @entity8 baby '			1
@entity10 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , did n't even try looking for his mother because he had no information about her - but after @entity15 posted an image on @entity17 explaining that she 'd been dumped in a @entity8 27 years ago , it took her just three weeks to find her mother			1
inspired , @entity19 decided to do the same , and has now shared an image on his @entity17 profile showing him holding a sign reading : ' please help me ! i am looking for my birth mother			1
' being abandoned in a @entity32 , no records			0
after seeing [ @entity15 's ] story , and she found her mom so quickly , that 's what gave me the inspiration to do mine			1
' @entity10 still had his umbilical cord attached when a manager found him wrapped in a brown plastic bag in the sink of the women 's restroom in a @entity2 's in @entity45 , @entity3 in december 1977			1
he was given the name ' @entity2 ' because of where he was found , but his name was legally changed when he was adopted a year later , records show			0

younger years : @entity10 was just hours old when he was found in a sink and taken to safety new home : he was adopted when he was one but his mother , right , passed away two years ago scene : he was wrapped in a brown bag and left in a restroom in this @entity62 's , which still stands ' i believe she was young , maybe hiding her pregnancy or whatever , and she probably did n't have the means to support me , and i believe that she left me there for somebody to find me , ' he said			1
he continued : ' i had a wonderful life , great family that treated me well ... i 'm very happy , but i just would like to complete the circle and find my birth mother			2
i believe some things are meant to be			0
' @entity15 had success with social media in march this year when she posted an image online showing her holding up a sign detailing the circumstances of her discovery			0
' looking for my birth mother , ' it read			2
' she abandoned me in the @entity8 bathroom only hours old , @entity83			0
please help me find her by sharing my post			0
' @entity85 : @entity10 , pictured with his wife right , said he had a happy upbringing but wants to find his mother for closure inspiration : @entity15 , center , launched a similar campaign in march after she was left in a @entity8 bathroom 27 years ago			1

her adoptive mother is right her birth mother , @entity96 , learned of the @entity17 post and contacted her through a lawyer , revealing to her daughter that she had abandoned her following a rape that she hid from her family when she was just 16			2

he was adopted a year later and never really considered looking for his birth mother because he had no information about her
but he was inspired by @entity15 , who appealed for her mother who had left her in a @entity8 - and was reunited with her after 3 weeks
