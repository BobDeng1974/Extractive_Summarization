@entity0 are confident @entity1 can thrive on a return to the starting xv at @entity4 on saturday after first - choice scrum half @entity5 was ruled out			1
care was named in the tourists ’ original line - up for the first test against the @entity10 , but a fitness test on a shoulder injury confirmed he would miss the series opener			1
@entity1 is promoted from the bench			1
it has not been a vintage season for @entity1 , but @entity18 claimed he is returning to peak form in time for this daunting clash with the world champions			1
stepping in : @entity1 ( right ) will take @entity5 's place in the @entity0 starting xv on the ball : @entity1 looks for a pass as @entity0 trained at the @entity25 near @entity26 on thursday speaking before @entity5 was definitively ruled out , @entity0 ’s head coach said : ‘ losing @entity5 would be a big blow but that would be lessened by @entity1 , whose form picked up at the end of the season			0
if you go back to the game in 2012 when he started against @entity10 , that was him at his best and he ’s approaching that form			0
‘ to go into a test against the @entity10 with anyone ( @entity5 ) who is not 100 per cent physically would be a poor decision			0
’ yet another enforced reshuffle by @entity0 means a bench role for @entity42 , even though he was involved in last saturday ’s @entity44 final			0
‘ @entity42 ’s buzzing , ’ added @entity18			2
‘ he ’ll be ready , no problem			0
’ faith : @entity0 coach @entity18 believes @entity1 is returning to his top form in time for the daunting @entity10 tour on the run : @entity0 warm - up with some sprints prior to their training session at the @entity54			2
