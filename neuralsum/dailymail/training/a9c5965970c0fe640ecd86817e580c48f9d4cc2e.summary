as an international striker who starred for both @entity3 teams , won the @entity4 with @entity5 ... and whose son , @entity6 , has been on @entity8 ’s books since he was seven , @entity0 is uniquely qualified to talk about the different philosophies at the two clubs			1
yet @entity0 feels strongly that it is ‘ a nonsense ’ to compare @entity8 ’s policy of buying the best players aged between 16 and 18 from around the world to @entity5 ’s long tradition of developing local youngsters , from the celebrated class of 92 all the way through to today ’s first - teamer @entity20			1
but @entity0 is no city - basher			1
he scored 10 goals in 23 games for the club in 2005 - 06 having enjoyed spectacular success at @entity5			1
he entrusted @entity8 with 19 - year - old @entity6 ’s footballing education because he felt ‘ comfortable ’ there			1
@entity5 youth team coach @entity29 and the @entity18 of ' 92 but while @entity32 learned about the @entity5 way from the likes of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and the @entity39 — all born and raised in @entity3 and brought through the ranks at @entity31 — he can not see how @entity8 ’s £ 100million investment in the @entity41 can produce the same impact without enough young players from the local area who really know and care about the club			1
@entity47 rules state that a ‘ homegrown ’ player is someone who has spent three years at the club up to age 21			0
it means you can be signed by a club at 18 and still then be classified as ‘ homegrown ’			0
laughably , @entity55 is categorised as a @entity5 homegrown player even though his formative years were spent at @entity57 and he was already an @entity58 player when sir @entity59 signed him for £ 27million in 2004			1
@entity0 's son @entity6 is currently on loan at @entity62 after 12 years at @entity8 @entity8 have stockpiled the best young talent from @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 from their mid-teens			1
players like @entity71 and @entity72 were signed at 17 and both are tipped for the top			0
they are currently on loan to top @entity77 clubs while @entity0 , who has been at the club for 12 years , is on loan at @entity62 @entity62 having failed to make a first - team appearance for @entity8			1
unsurprisingly , @entity32 feels that despite the public emphasis from @entity8 on the importance of developing players , there is a marked difference between them and @entity5			1
‘ are you talking about real homegrown players , or players bought and called homegrown ? it is a totally different entity , ’ he says			0
‘ what i would call homegrown are kids who are born in @entity3 or the @entity95 , have gone to @entity5 or @entity8 as young kids and come through the system			1
‘ the rules say a homegrown player can be when you buy someone in and he ’s there for three years			0
that means homegrown ? it is a nonsense			0
’ striker @entity0 enjoyed spectacular success during six seasons at @entity5 @entity0 scored 121 goals in six seasons at @entity5 from 1995 to 2001 during @entity59 ’s heyday			1
he is now a club ambassador and puts a lot of what he has achieved down to being helped by the group who had come through the youth ranks			0
‘ signing players from abroad at 16 or 17 is not the same as the class of 92 that @entity5 had , ’ he says fervently			2
‘ i played with those guys , they knew what it was to grow with @entity5 , they wanted to play for them and appreciated everything about the club			2
that ’s homegrown — you do n’t buy in homegrown talent			0
’ there have been fears @entity5 might reduce their priority on local players after a £ 158m spending spree on world stars like @entity133 , which looked like an attempt to copy @entity8 rather than re-establish their own identity			1
@entity0 hopes that wo n’t be the case			2
‘ they should care about it ( homegrown players ) at @entity5			2
if you look at the history , look at the number of local boys who have come through — that is the ethos of @entity5 , ’ he argues			1
@entity0 spent a season at @entity8 and his son joined the club 's youth academy aged seven ‘ if you look at the @entity4 winners or legends , look at the number of homegrown players they ’ve had			1
without people like @entity35 , @entity37 , @entity36 and @entity158 , i would n’t be sitting here talking to you			0
it has to be possible to carry on			0
‘ @entity3 is one of the biggest cities in @entity58 , if you ca n’t get talent from here , where can you get it from ? maybe i ’m old - fashioned but that ’s the way i look at it			2
’ @entity0 had no qualms , however , about letting @entity6 choose @entity8			1
‘ he is a young boy who wants to make his way in football			0
he has been at @entity8 since he was a kid and if he makes it there , as a father i ’m going to be happy , ’ he says			2
‘ that is what he wants to do			0
he knows how tough it is to become a professional and if he makes a career at @entity8 , i ’ll support him			2
but if he plays for @entity177 , i ’m still going to support him , he ’s my son			0
‘ the most important thing for a father is that your son is comfortable			0
he has been at @entity8 since he was seven and it was n’t for me to take him out of that system when he was comfortable			2
’ @entity20 is latest local boy to graduate from the academy to first team at @entity5 the bond that exists between a group of players that grow up together carries on long after retirement , according to @entity0			1
it ’s why he thinks @entity192 ’s recent barbs in his autobiography were aimed at @entity59 and his cronies , rather than his team - mates , who welcome @entity192 back to play in @entity5 old boys games			2
‘ i know @entity192 well , i have never had a problem with him and i could never see myself ever having a problem , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we got on very well when we were playing and he took me to @entity201 when he was a manager			0
we all have opinions but i think if you look at what he said or the articles , i do n’t think he mentioned any of the boys he actually played with			0
‘ when we catch up , we all have a laugh and a joke and that is the beauty of it , whatever someone has said			0
‘ we played one in @entity212 recently , that was a good one			0
i do n’t think @entity192 has got an axe to grind			0
’ @entity0 was speaking at the unveiling of the ‘ @entity216 ’ and customised @entity218 squad watches by @entity219 , @entity5 ’s official timekeeping partner .			1

@entity0 hails @entity5 's long tradition of developing local youngsters
@entity3 born @entity20 is the latest to graduate from academy
@entity0 's son @entity6 has joined @entity62 on loan after 12 years at @entity8
