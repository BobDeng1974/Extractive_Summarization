the identity of the traveler who was filmed as he made homophobic comments at @entity3 last thursday before attacking a man has finally been revealed			1
airport police reports released on tuesday show that he is a 27 - year - old from @entity7 , @entity8 , whose name is @entity11			1
video of @entity11 's attack , which ends with him being tackled to the ground by a group of heroic fellow travelers attempting to help the victim , has been viewed 4 million times on @entity19			0
after insulting the agent , the complainant informed a visibly intoxicated @entity11 that police were on the way in an attempt to diffuse the situation , and when the agent then asked if @entity11 had been drinking , the man replied , ' yes , 100 drinks			2
' at this point , according to the @entity48 , @entity11 punched the complainant in the eye , for no apparent reason , called him a gay slur , and then began berating another traveler			2
it seems that it was only then that @entity56 , the man who posted the @entity19 video , began filming the incident on his cellphone , actually missing the beginning of the physical altercation			0
how it all began : the complainant ( above in pink shirt ) angered @entity11 ( in a green sweatshirt ) when he tried to defend a gate agent the man had been berating then , as the airport officer arrived on the scene , @entity11 again starting attacking the complainant , kicking him in the groin and pulling his hair before five nearby passengers tackled him to the ground			1
when asked why he was attacking the complainant , @entity11 told one of the men subduing him , ' this is @entity77 , that ’s why			0
it ’s the same reason you get to live , to breathe , to walk black			0
you know what i ’m talking about ? ' @entity11 is being charged with simple assault and public intoxication			1
the complainant , who wishes to remain unnamed , declined medical attention and had no visible marks or bruises			0
one positive : one of the men who took down @entity11 , @entity91 ( above ) , was confused for actor @entity92 when the video went viral double take : @entity91 ( circled in red ) does bear a striking resemblance to @entity92 at least one person is getting something good out of this incident however , as @entity91 , a 28 - year - old @entity3 man who helped take @entity11 down , caused quite the stir on monday when many watching the video believed him to be famed actor @entity92			1
@entity91 said of that experience in an email to @entity106 on tuesday , ' it was certainly fun to be a part of for a day , and something my friends and i will look back on and laugh about for many years			0

the homophobe filmed attacking a man he though was gay at @entity3 last thursday is @entity11
the 27 - year - old from @entity7 , @entity8 , also punched his victim in the face before anyone started filming the incident
the fight began when @entity11 's victim attempted to help a *female* gate agent who the man had been berating
at one point , @entity11 told the gate agent he had consumed ' 100 drinks ' that day
he is being charged with simple assault and public intoxication , but his victim is not *pressing* charges
