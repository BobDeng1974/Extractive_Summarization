animal welfare staff are desperately trying to re-home 25 black cats found crammed into a pensioner 's one - room flat			1
they were stunned to find the cats , which were all given names starting with the letter @entity7 , after being called to the property by the elderly man 's relative after he had to move homes due to ill health			1
but despite knowing they were going to be collecting a few animals , the @entity14 staff had no idea just how many jet black cats they would be collecting from the small , one - room flat in @entity21 , @entity22			1
a group of the black cats look up at the camera after being found crammed inside a closet next to a hoover @entity30 ( pictured ) was one of the 25 black cats found , all of which were given names starting with the letter h aside from those too young to go to a new home , most of the black cats are now up for adoption			1
pictured is @entity37 the cats , thought to be aged from four weeks to six years old , were all unneutered and had been breeding uncontrollably			0
staff at @entity14 's @entity40 , in @entity21 , are now hoping to find homes for all the black cats			1
centre manager @entity43 said that although all were in good health , many were very nervous of people			2
she said : ' finding homes for all these cats is going to be a huge challenge and we desperately need to hear from people who may be able to offer one a home			2
' none of the cats had been neutered and so , in just a few years , the number of cats in the home had grown enormously			1
' cats are prolific breeders and this case shows how easy it is for things to get out of hand			0
' one unneutered female can give birth to around 18 kittens every year and be responsible for up to 20,000 descendants within five years , as kittens can breed when they are four months old			0
@entity70 from the @entity71 plays with one of the cats called @entity74 pictured left and right respectively are @entity75 and @entity76 , both of which are seeking adoption three kittens , named @entity81 , peer at the photographer three more kittens - called @entity85 - take a moment to rest together despite the cramped conditions , the cats were all healthy and well - fed. @entity89 is one of the cats , named @entity92 despite the cramped conditions , they are healthy cats , well - fed , with glossy coats and no signs of illness			0
she added : ' but with so many cats it seems that they were not properly socialised so they are very nervous of people			0
' we 're doing a lot of work with them to help bring them out of their shells and we 're hoping that , in time , they will settle in well into new homes			0
' we are bracing ourselves for a challenge - black cats are hard to find homes for anyway , as people often prefer different colours			1
' and a nervous black cat is an even harder prospect to find a new home for			2
' i really hope we can find some owners who can see past the nerves and spot the potential for these lovely cats to become family pets			0
' they deserve to be in a nice new home so we 're hoping they wo n't have to spend too long with us at the centre			0
' black cats are seen as good luck charms in most of the world , including @entity132 and @entity133 , but in @entity134 they are seen as bad omens			2

animal welfare staff called to pensioner 's house after he had moved home
there they discovered 25 black cats with names all starting with letter @entity7
the animals were crammed into a tiny one - room flat in @entity21
none had been neutered and so the number of cats had grown *quickly*
