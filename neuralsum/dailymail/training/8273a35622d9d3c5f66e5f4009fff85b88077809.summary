prince @entity0 , pictured , has started using a special mobile phone for the hard of hearing he only bedgrudgingly started to wear a hearing aid in public a few months ago			1
but prince @entity0 is already making adjustments for it in other areas of his life			2
the 93 - year - old royal has just started using a special mobile phone especially designed for people suffering from hearing loss , it can be revealed			1
most high street phones are not compatible for people wearing aids because of the levels of interfearence			0
and while @entity0 ’s new amplicomms @entity20 is short on smart phone - style gimmicks , it can be up to 80 times louder than regular mobiles			1
it also has a powerful vibrating alert - and a ringtone that can sound as loud as a road drill			1
the phone also boasts a voice assisted operating system , a large keypad and screen and an @entity34 emergency button linked to five pre-selected numbers			1
despite his age @entity0 is also something of a silver surfer who regularly uses the internet and was one of the earliest users of a mobile communication device when he had one fitted in his car back in 1953 , he will , therefore , no doubt be delighted with the phone ’s one touch 2megapixel camera and video recorder			2
the £ 99 phone was sent to the @entity52 ’s husband as a gift by @entity54 , a firm set up by @entity55 and prince @entity57 ’s close friend , millionaire businessman @entity58			1
the firm received a standard thank you letter on its receipt			2
but then shortly before @entity64 the company received a call from @entity0 ’s private secretary to say how much he loved it			1
‘ apparently the @entity57 said it was the best he had ever used and his aide asked us if there were any extra accessories to go with it , ’ said a company source			2
director @entity75 added : ‘ we wanted to offer our support to the @entity57 , hopefully with a gift that he would find really useful			0
‘ we spoke to a representative of hrh prince @entity0 who said that @entity57 is very pleased with the @entity80 , and it is an improvement on anything else he has used in the recent past			0
‘ we ’ve since sent a car charger and headphones that will help keep conversations private			0
‘ we hope prince @entity0 is benefiting from his new hearing aids			0
too many people avoid wearing @entity89 , risking exclusion from so much happening around them			0
’ prince @entity0 has only recently started wearing a hearing aid in public which is barely visible , left , and is said to be very pleased with his new mobile handset , similar to the one on the right , with its loud ringtone @entity0 was first seen in public wearing hearing aids on each year at a public reception last october			1
it was a rare concession to his age for the prince , who normally bats off enquiries about his health with a brusque : ‘ do i look bloody ill ? ’ just a fifth of people with hearing problems wear an aid because of the apparent ‘ stigma ’ , a study by @entity108 found earlier last year			0
professor @entity114 , @entity115 professor of @entity116 at the @entity108 who worked on the study , said : ‘ there still seems to be a stigma attached to wearing a hearing aid , where as there is little stigma now associated with vision loss and wearing spectacles			0

the amplicomms @entity20 mobile is up to 80 times louder than normal
the handset also features a larger keypad and an @entity34 emergency button
the company , @entity54 , received a thank - you call from the @entity135
