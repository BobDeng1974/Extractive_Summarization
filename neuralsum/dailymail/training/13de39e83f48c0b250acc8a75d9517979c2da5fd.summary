@entity1 chairman @entity0 has admitted he made a mistake in appointing @entity3 as the club 's manager at the start of the season			1
with @entity3 now sacked , and @entity8 soon to be announced as the @entity1 ' manager after leaving @entity10 , @entity0 spoke to former player @entity11 for the club 's official @entity13 channel			1
' history will judge ( whether the time was right for @entity3 to leave )			1
we 're one game in to him not being here			0
i know people say it , @entity3 is a very nice guy , a really nice guy			1
i would have loved him to be a success			0
@entity1 chairman @entity0 ( left ) spoke to @entity11 ( right ) for the club 's @entity13 channel @entity8 ( second left , with @entity26 ) is due to be announced as the new manager of @entity1 ' in the maelstrom that was going on then , i probably wanted to get someone in too much			1
i felt that what we had here ( when @entity33 left ) we could just keep going			1
' and i did n't see anyone out there at the time that i wanted to make a three or four year commitment to , and @entity3 was prepared to come in and do it on a slightly shorter - term basis and help out			1
it felt the right thing to do and i do n't think we 're massively behind where we should be			0
' despite that , @entity1 are holders of one of the relegation places in the @entity47			1
three wins in their first 20 matches sees them three points off bottom , and @entity26 was honest in his assessment that the time was right to sack @entity3			1
' i just think that we were drifting away from what we 're good at			0
and i do n't think it 's the time to change things [ on the pitch ]			2
we tried to play a different formation [ against ] @entity63 and i felt we looked a bit lost at sea at times , the crowd went flat			2
it 's difficult then to dig yourself out of that			2
@entity8 was at @entity1 's @entity71 training ground on friday for his first day at the club the former @entity1 midfielder pulls into the @entity1 ' training ground in @entity75 on friday morning @entity33 left the club before the start of the season and @entity0 admits he rushed into finding a replacement @entity3 ( right ) guided palace into the relegation zone and @entity8 ( left ) will be tasked with getting them out ' things have n't gone so well , with @entity33 [ @entity85 ] going just before the start of the season , it causes upheaval			1
i probably did n't get the right fit with @entity3 , i 've got ta take it on the chin for that one			1
' last season , it did n't start smoothly for @entity1 either			1
@entity94 was in charge for the beginning of the 13/14 campaign , and it took a managerial change to kick - start things and instill some belief into the squad			0
this season , @entity0 admits , it is @entity104 who have reaped the rewards of an increase in confidence			1
' @entity104 have got a few results			0
that happened to us last season , the belief grows			2
@entity33 came in and galvanised everyone around			2
his style fitted with our players and he did a great job			0
the players did a great job , the whole place was lifted , it was amazing			0
@entity0 spoke to friend and former @entity1 striker @entity11 in a lounge at @entity124 @entity11 quizzed the @entity1 chief on @entity3 , the future and what the club achieved under @entity33 @entity129 ( left ) scores against @entity1 in what turned out to be @entity3 's last as @entity1 manager ' that @entity134 game ( when @entity1 drew 3 - 3 in may ) , it was the first game i was really relaxed			1
i remember going 3 - 0 down and sitting next to you ( @entity11 ) on my phone and thinking , " well , it 's not great is it ? "			2
then @entity140 ( @entity141 ) loses track of where he was , and tries to cross it ... ' when @entity146 ( @entity147 ) breaks past @entity148 , it 's just ... and the place was electric			0
so yeah , the season was great			0
but like i said to you before , i do n't look back really , it 's pointless			2
enjoy it , celebrate it , then try and move on			0
' and @entity1 have moved on			2
@entity26 cracked the whip and another manager has been pushed out of the exit door at the club 's @entity71 training ground			1
despite their league position , there have been highlights , including a 3 - 1 win against @entity134 at @entity124 @entity165 was in tears on the pitch as @entity1 came back from three down to draw 3 - 3 with @entity134 @entity168 scored his second goal late on to secure the draw for @entity1 at @entity171 it was n't a decision that @entity0 made lightly ; in fact , he does n't make any decisions at the click of a finger			1
' i do n't just roll the dice , " oh lets just do that then " ' , the @entity1 chief continued			2
' i really agonise over everything , chat to @entity184 's co-chairman ] about things endlessly , try and work out the best thing to do			0
we 've got to make more right decisions than the rest of them to catch up			0
' i 'm pretty tough nut with things like that			0
you make decisions in football to create emotions			0
right now i think we need a lift , we need something to lift the place			0
there 's a real sense that we might lose something we 've got , and the @entity47 is such a fantastic place to be and we want to stay there			0
' it 's about tapping into those emotions to get the sense of what people feel			0
it should n't be knee - jerk			0
' so , starting with a trip to @entity214 in the @entity215 on sunday , it is now the job of @entity8 to steady the @entity124 ship			1
as @entity0 says , @entity1 need a lift ... and @entity8 , who was at the club 's @entity71 training ground on friday , may just be the man to sort it			1
