despite all of this nothing stops her smiling ! ' @entity9 said : ' i just forget i am small			0
i see myself as the same as everyone else			0
' it is an upbeat assessment of what in many ways has been a difficult time , with countless appointments with specialists and hospital surgery the wheelchair would help @entity9 reach cupboards and shelves and be more independent , since at the moment she is unable to bear her own weight or even lift a kettle			0
the campaign site said : ' it also goes to floor level from the comfort of her seat			0
@entity9 ca n't weight bear whatsoever so ca n't stand up or get in or out of her wheelchair without help , if she drops anything she relies on the people around her to pick it up - she finds this extremely frustrating ! ' her current @entity219 wheelchair has been fantastic but it is just so big and does not have all the freedom options of a " @entity222 "			1
the cost for such a bespoke wheelchair is an overwhelming £ 18,000			1
