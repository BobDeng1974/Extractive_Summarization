by @entity0 the semi final between @entity2 and @entity3 was by no means the most exciting game of the @entity5 , but @entity7 's slip of the tongue somewhat livened up the last - four clash			1
the co-commentator , on duty for @entity12 , got mixed up when trying to say ' penalised ' - and instead blurted out the word ' penis '			0
it certainly peaked the attention of those finding the match dull , as it ended in a 0 - 0 stalemate after 120 minutes			2
@entity42 took the first penalty of a shootout which @entity3 won 4 - 2 comfortably , as @entity48 's @entity2 could n't escape the semi final			1
@entity50 stand in @entity42 's way of making history on sunday when the two teams meet at the @entity54			0
winner : @entity42 could n't win it for @entity3 in regular time but scored his penalty in the shootout one step from glory : @entity42 ( left ) breaks from the @entity63 group to celebrate the decisive penalty how do you get through this ? @entity42 ends up passing the ball as he is surrounded by so many @entity69 markers marked man : @entity42 has four @entity69 defenders surrounding him as he attempts to make a trademark dribble			0

@entity2 and @entity3 play out 0 - 0 stalemate in @entity5 semi final
@entity3 go through to reach final after winning 4 - 2 on penalties
@entity7 *mistakenly* blurts out ' penis ' during co-commentary mishap
