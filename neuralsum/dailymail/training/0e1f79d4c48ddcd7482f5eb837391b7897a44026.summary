by @entity1 reporter published : 18:10 est , 5 december 2013 @entity3 : 19:14 est , 5 december 2013 the lesbian waitress who claimed that she was left a bigoted note may have lied again as a charity has still not received a donation that she announced she was making			1
@entity8 kicked up a firestorm after telling a gay advocacy group that she was left a homophobic note by a family that she waited on who instead of a tip. the family later said she was making it up , but that has n't stopped 22 - year - old @entity8 from collecting tips from other customers who were eager to make up for what they believed was a real insult			1
some good , finally : @entity8 has begun refunding well - wishers who donated around $ 3,000 to her after hearing her outrageous tale she later said that she would donate the ' replacement tips ' that she had received since the ordeal to the @entity27 , a charity that helps injured soldiers			1
now the charity has told the local patch site in @entity30 , @entity31 that they have not been able to find any donations from anyone in the area near her home address - meaning that they would be able to find it whether or not she used her name or remained anonymous			2
the only other way that the donation could have been made without it being searchable is through an unidentified third party or in a different zip code			2
she first announced that the donation - the amount of which remained undisclosed - was going to @entity48 because of her own personal military service as a @entity50 , but that has also been called into question			0
upset : @entity8 , pictured left while a marine and right , said she was offended and hurt by how the couple , with two small children , treated her while she served them but the family denied her claims while @entity8 did serve in the @entity60 reserve from july 2009 to may 2013 , thereâ € ™ s no indication in her record of any combat service in @entity64 or @entity65			1
the donation issue is just the latest in a string of lies that have been unearthed , as @entity69 previously interviewed one of @entity8 ' friends who told a number of the 22 - year - old 's other tall tales			1
@entity75 , 23 , from @entity76 , @entity77 , said she met @entity8 in november 2011 when she got engaged to one of her best friends , @entity78			1
proof ? the controversial receipt ( left ) shows exactly the same price , time and date of the meal as the family 's copy ( right ) - but does not have the $ 18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $ 111.55 ' we hit it off from the start and i never had such a good a connection from a girl ever			2
my husband and i left her stay the night at our house so many times			0
' ' but then things started coming up - she started saying things about how she was once pregnant and the baby died			0
she claimed she was blown up in her tank in @entity64			0
she said everybody else in the platoon were killed - so there were no other witnesses			0
we just soaked it all up			0

@entity8 claimed that customers left her a bigoted *message* rather than a tip but the family has said she made that up
she also promised to donate the ' replacement ' tips she received but now the charity has said that they have no record of the donation
@entity8 , who friends say *frequently* made up stories , has been taken off the *schedule* at her *restaurant*
