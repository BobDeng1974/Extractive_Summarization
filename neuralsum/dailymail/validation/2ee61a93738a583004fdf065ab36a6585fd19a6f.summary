a blood test that screens couples for thousands of genetic flaws which they could pass on to a baby is to go on sale			1
couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease			1
the compatibility test can flag up more than 600 conditions , including some that kill within the first years of life			1
if couples are told they are at risk of having a child whose life would be blighted by ill - health , they can decide whether to adopt , have @entity17 treatment or go ahead and get pregnant naturally			1
new test : couples will be told if the combination of their genes puts them at risk of having a child with an incurable disease @entity26 firm @entity25 , which developed the test , says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans			1
the company ’s test is designed to give peace of mind , but at £ 1,800 per couple – £ 900 per person – it does n’t come cheap			0
plus , there are concerns people will become stigmatised simply because they are carrying the ‘ wrong genes ’			1
critics also say it panders to those who believe the only acceptable child is a perfect one			0
the @entity42 does pre-pregnancy testing but focuses on people with a family history of just a few conditions			2
the new test , which will be available at @entity50 clinics in @entity51 and @entity52 from may , checks for thousands of faulty pieces of @entity55			0
conditions include cystic fibrosis , which is carried by one in 25 @entity58 , as well as rarer conditions that cause blindness , blood disorders and life - threatening hormonal problems			0
conditions such as autism , alzheimer ’s disease and diabetes are not included			2
@entity26 firm @entity25 , which developed the test , says pre-pregnancy genetic screening could soon become as commonplace as ultrasound scans the test is aimed at people who are carriers of disease genes , meaning they will not have symptoms themselves and may even be unaware of the problem lurking in their dna			1
most people have several disease genes and a recent study by @entity25 found that 8 per cent of couples were ‘ clinically incompatible ’ , meaning both had the same faulty dna			1
such couples would be told there was a one in four chance of their child being ill and counselled on their options			2
these include an @entity17 technique , in which only healthy embryos are implanted in the womb , the use of donor eggs or sperm or adoption			0
some women may opt to get pregnant naturally and abort later			0
dr @entity97 , managing director of @entity50 , said : ‘ our wide - ranging new screen will detect potential problems before pregnancy by obtaining information from both parents			0
with this test , we can alert prospective parents to the risk of serious genetic conditions			2
’ there is another pre-pregnancy test available privately but it checks for only 100 diseases			2
@entity111 , of the @entity112 , said the limited and expensive options available to couples who ‘ fail ’ the test could push them toward getting pregnant naturally – and aborting if the baby is unhealthy			1
she added : ‘ this test is going to create further anxiety through the over-medicalisation of pregnancy			0
’ dr @entity121 , of campaign group @entity122 , warned that if testing became popular , couples could feel pressurised to use it to avoid having children with genetic conditions			1
he added : ‘ that will lead to a society in which parents with disabled children will be blamed and disability will become less and less acceptable			0
we need regulation and ethical debate before such tests are introduced			0
