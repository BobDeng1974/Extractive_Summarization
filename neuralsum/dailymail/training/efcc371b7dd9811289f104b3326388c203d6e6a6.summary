" ' looking back on their final moments together , she said , ' the three of us , especially , have been through so much together , so we garner a lot of strength from one another , and i think being together during that time - and also for the kids , to have their family together during that time - was incredibly important			0

' the affair between @entity11 and @entity13 began while he was campaigning for the highest office in the land back in 2004 , and he waited until it was clear that he would neither be the presidential nor vice presidential nominee to sit down in 2008 and admit that he had cheated on his popular wife @entity49			1
in a 2008 interview , @entity11 said that he did have an affair with @entity13 but he was not the father of her daughter @entity13			1
he later retracted this statement			0
speaking out : @entity11 was listed as a possible witness during the trial but she was never called to the stand throughout the ordeal , @entity11 ' aide @entity110 volunteered to pretend that he was the father of @entity13 's child , and they used nearly $ 1million to cover @entity13 's tracks , flying her across country with the @entity116 and keeping her hidden in various mansions			1
that money was the focus of the federal trial against @entity11 , where they had to prove that the money used to hide @entity13 was given by personal donors who understood that it was not so much a political donation to @entity11 ' campaign but that it was being used to help hide the word of the affair			2
@entity11 was actually listed by the defense as a possible witness in @entity11 ' case , but she was never actually called to the stand			0
the public attention surrounding the @entity11 family drama did not die down after the trial ended in may , as @entity13 released a tell - all book just a few months later where she trashed @entity49			1
in her book ' what really happened : @entity2 , our daughter and me ' , @entity13 describes the @entity11 ' marriage as broken by the time she arrived on the scene			1
@entity13 announced last summer that she and her longtime lover @entity2 are ' no longer a couple ' she wrote that @entity49 - who at the time was battling her second bout of breast cancer - was a ' witch on wheels ' who belittled her beloved @entity153 and was very aware that their marriage was on the outs			1
@entity13 has faced much criticism for painting such a grim portrait of @entity49 in her book , especially since she died in 2010 and she can no longer respond to @entity13 's claims			2
that criticism was echoed by @entity11 in her @entity16 interview , set to air on friday			0
' i just thought it was â€” i thought it was a poor choice , i guess , is all i can say , ' @entity11 said diplomatically			0
as for @entity13 's current role in their family , it remains unclear as she said during her book tour that she and ' @entity153 ' had just decided to end their relationship , though that announcement came just days after they were pictured enjoying a beach vacation with @entity13 for @entity174 .			2
