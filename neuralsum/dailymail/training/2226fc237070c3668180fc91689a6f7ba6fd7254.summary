by @entity0 when it comes to love and marriage , every couple is different			1
we only have to look at the celeb world to see various examples of the lovers who have sailed though marriage and the those with unions that are somewhat battle bruised			1
but what makes one couple last and another fall at the first ( or fifth ) hurdle and - more importantly - do you have what it takes to last the distance ? most of the reputable research points to seven , significant factors in making your relationship work			1
you 've managed to talk it through rationally , listened to each others ' viewpoints and come up with a solution that suits both of you			2
you do n't let jealously get out of control if there 's one thing that can destroy a perfectly good relationship rapidly , it 's inappropriate @entity41 - instead of losing it and storming out or trying to get even by flirting with someone else - you confess jealous feelings and allow yourself to be ­ reassured , you 're on track for success			1
couples tend to become less jealous of each other the longer you 're together for obvious @entity50 vote with their feet , so if you 're still together a few years on , you start to relax			2
you also get a better sense of whether someone is worthy of your trust			2
you do n't take a dubious comment the wrong way if your partner says something that could be misconstrued , you 'll put the best possible light on it rather than think the worst			2
for example if your partner says : ' all i want to do is turn on some trash telly			2
i 'm sick of everyone			2
' instead of getting huffy and assuming they 're included you ' everyone ' , you say , ' i know what it 's like			0
let me get you a nice big glass of wine			0
' or , if your partner does n't feel like sex , you simply think , they must be tired , not , they do n't fancy me anymore			1
@entity0 says that smart lovers keep each other hungry for more you do n't change to suit each other , you work with each other no - one really wants to change because we all secretly think we 're perfect ! what feels more natural is to both be aware of each other 's bottom line – what you each will and wo n't put up with – while allowing each other to be individuals			1
you 're on track for a long - lasting relationship when there 's a certain standard of behaviour that 's expected , but you 're not rigid			1
neither of you compromise those standards , but you are prepared to put their needs before your own occasionally			0
you think first , react later everyone sees the world differently , through a different filter			0
if you truly accept each other , you 'll allow for differences			0
if your partner 's being extraordinarily critical of someone or something , you 'll listen first to what they have to say , take into account any stresses and how tired they are , then throw in your two pence worth – if at all			0
important issues are worth fighting over ; trivial differences are n't			0
you know how to say goodbye your partner is about to head off for a two - week work conference overseas			0
you do n't cling on , sob and feel miserable and resentful they 're having time away from you			1
you take them to the airport , kiss and hug , then wave them off cheerily			0
a graceful exit is the best preparation for the next grand entrance			0
smart lovers keep each other hungry for more			0
you both feel you 're getting a fair deal from the ­ relationship last but crucially important , ask yourself this : who 's getting the best deal from this relationship : me or my partner ? are they getting much more out of it than you or vice versa ? couples who honestly answer , ' it 's fairly equal ' , are those who report the highest relationship satisfaction			1
