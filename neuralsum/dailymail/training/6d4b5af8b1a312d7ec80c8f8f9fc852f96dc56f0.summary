this is the moment an attorney stopped police from arresting a disabled black man on suspicion of burgling a house almost a mile away			1
@entity5 came out of her house in @entity7 , @entity8 to see an officer preparing to search 64 - year - old @entity10 , a local handy man who told officers he was disabled			1
demanding to know why he was being detained , mrs @entity5 was told police received reports of a burlgary and stopped him as a possible suspect			1
anger : @entity5 ( right ) accosted a police officer when she saw @entity10 ( center ) being detained support : mrs @entity5 rushed to help mr @entity22 as her housekeeper in @entity8 filmed the ordeal ' we have a burglar alarm , ' one of the officers said			1
' he 's coming with bags			0
' but after intense questioning , captured on video by her housekeeper , mrs @entity30 discovered the burglary was in another neighborhood three - quarters of a mile away and there were no grounds for suspicion			1
' i 'm an attorney and this is wrong ! ' she said			2
' now please leave our neighborhood			0
' the female officer attempting to arrest mr @entity10 insisted he was ' loud and boisterous ' when she stopped him			2
fighter : @entity5 blasted the officers ' conduct as they detained the man without a description ' that 's because you 're accusing him , ' mrs @entity5 retorted			1
finally , after complaining to a passing officer about the incident , she secured his release			2
' come on @entity10 , they said you can go , ' she said as she helped him up			0
she then turned to the police officer to say : ' i 'm reporting this			0
' just because he 's black does n't mean he 's here to rob a house			0
' he works for us , he 's been in this neighborhood for 30 years			0
' it has since emerged that the owner of the ' burgled ' house had accidentally keyed in the wrong number to his garage , setting off the alert			1
the two officers , who were both black , did not have a description of a potential suspect when they went on patrol at 1pm on october 1			2
mrs @entity5 told the paper : ' it was very interesting , in the sense of getting a picture of how black cops treat black people , and how humiliating it was for him			1
' they were treating him just like a dog			0
' @entity82 told the @entity83 they believed there to be ' no misconduct ' and accused mrs @entity5 of making ' assumptions of her own ' by accusing the officers of racism			1
questions : she discovered he was being arrested on suspicion of robbing a house almost a mile away warning : she said she plans to report the case , accusing the cops of being racist for picking on @entity22 no suspect : it emerged the officers did not have a description for a suspect of the alleged burglary the incident will now be addressed at a committee on stop - searches in the city next week			2
some reports have noted that , while the attorney 's bold actions should be lauded , the officers ' reactions are revealing about class			0
the @entity111 by columnist @entity110 notes that mrs @entity5 , a white , educated woman , receives ' an incredible amount of leeway and deference ' from the officers			1
' she â€™s pointing her fingers and gesturing toward the car window , ' he noted			0
' that 's the type of behavior that coming from many other people would be considered dangerous , threatening or violent in some way			0

@entity5 stopped @entity82 detaining disabled black man
officers told her he was a suspect in a robbery almost a mile away
mrs @entity5 blasts officers for having no grounds to arrest him and forces them to release him then helps him get away
it turned out that the ' robbery ' was simply a *homeowner* setting off his own alarm after entering the wrong garage key code
