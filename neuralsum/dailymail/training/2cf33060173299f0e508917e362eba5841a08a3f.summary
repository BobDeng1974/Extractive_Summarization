by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 11:25 est , 29 october 2013 composed : @entity1 walked up several flights of stairs to the emergency department and calmly asked to see a doctor there was no need for @entity8 to fill in a form explaining his problem when he arrived at a hospital emergency department			1
the giant fruit knife buried into his skull was a bit of a give - away			2
but staff were so shocked at his calm composure , he still had to bend down to prove it was n't a joke			1
mr @entity1 walked into @entity24 hospital 's @entity22 , in @entity25 in northeast @entity26 , after climbing five flights of stairs because the lift was full			1
he told receptionists : ' i 'd like to see a doctor please			0
' an emergency x-ray showed that the blade penetrated through his skull and into his brain but had missed any of the main blood vessels			0
during a three - hour operation , doctors carefully removed the blade without apparently causing any significant damage			0
after the man was bandaged he even asked if he could go home			2
asked how the knife had ended up in his head he declined to give details to doctors , saying : ' it 's like this , i was playing a silly game with my friend and it went wrong and i ended up with a knife in the head			1
it was just a silly mistake and it could have happened to anybody			0
' in the end doctors agreed to allow the man to discharge himself and he left together with the fruit knife after his wound had been bandaged , and after he told medics he promised to come back for a check - up			0
disbelief : the receptionist was so shocked that he had to bend down to prove that the embedded knife in his skull was n't a joke lucky escape : surgeons spent three hours carefully removing the blade from his brain			1
remarkably it did n't sever any major blood vessels			0

@entity1 calmly walked into @entity22 having climbed five flights of stairs
with the knife embedded in his skull , he asked to see a doctor
receptionist was so shocked he had to bend down to prove it was real
surgeons spent 3 hours removing the knife and he went home *straight* after
he would only say the injury was caused by a game gone wrong
