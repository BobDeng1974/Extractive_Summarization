a number of pilots at low - cost airline @entity2 refused to fly today following yesterday 's crash in the @entity5 that killed all 150 people on board			1
their decision came as it emerged the @entity10 that dropped out of the sky and ploughed into a mountainside had been grounded over technical fears just 24 hours before			0
helicopter operations continued for a second day in the grim search for debris and bodies - including those of three @entity20 nationals - that have been scattered over acres of mountain terrain			1
reports revealed the aircraft had suffered technical issues , including a landing gear problem , just a day before it was due to fly from @entity27 to @entity28			2
a spokeswoman for the airline 's parent company , @entity43 , said one @entity2 flight from @entity28 to @entity27 was cancelled because the pilots ' do n't feel they are in a position to fly '			1
she declined to say how many pilots declined to work today , adding that all @entity43 flights were going ahead as planned			1
staff at @entity2 and @entity43 wept during an emotional minute 's silence for victims of the disaster at their respective headquarters in @entity41 this afternoon			1
a spokesman for the pilots ' union @entity79 , @entity81 , insisted the decision was not because of concerns about safety			2
' it has nothing to do with safety			0
the pilots have friends and colleagues who have died , ' @entity81 said on public television			2
' that is such a heavy emotional burden that it 's better not to get into the cockpit			0
' obliterated : @entity96 teams sift through the wreckage of the @entity2 plane as the recovery operation enters its second day @entity5 mountain troopers are climb a hill near the makeshift helicopter landing pads in @entity103 to secure the area for the visit of @entity5 president @entity106 , @entity41 chancellor @entity107 and @entity109 prime minister @entity108 show of solidarity : @entity5 president @entity106 ( centre ) embraces @entity109 's prime minister @entity108 as @entity41 chancellor @entity107 ( second right ) looks on while they walk on a field near the crash site of @entity2 @entity10 near @entity117 - les - @entity103 yesterday , @entity2 had reported ' occasional flight disruptions within its route network ' as pilots were too shocked to fly following the news of the crash of an @entity2 jet			1
it was the first fatal accident in the history of @entity2 and the deadliest on the @entity5 mainland since 1974			2
' we understand their decision , ' said @entity2 executive @entity130			2
industry experts also sought to reassure @entity10 pilots that they will be safe			0
@entity133 , a safety specialist from the @entity135 ( @entity136 ) who is himself a former @entity10 pilot , said the aircraft is ‘ incredibly reliable with a good safety record ’			0
@entity141 task continues : a @entity5 @entity143 helicopter takes off for another search and rescue operation from @entity145 after a @entity2 @entity10 crashed into a mountainside in the @entity5 killing all 150 people on board he told @entity150 that hundreds of @entity58 are flying today and pilots should have ‘ no qualms getting on one today ’			1
a spokesman from @entity136 told @entity154 : ' @entity136 has gained information from the @entity41 pilot union that @entity43 and @entity2 are giving pilots time off for grief			1
‘ @entity20 pilots sympathise with their @entity41 colleagues and completely understand			1
‘ pilots have to be fit to fly , and if they feel emotionally unfit to fly , it is important they do not take to the air			1
it appears the company are doing the right thing in supporting them			0
’ in a separate development , experts claimed the @entity2 plane may have crashed because the windscreen cracked , causing a sudden drop in oxygen levels that rendered the pilots unconscious			1
reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the @entity10 had been analysed and revealed that a ' structural failure ' was responsible for the disaster			0
this @entity2 @entity10 carrying 144 passengers and six crew which crashed in the @entity5 @entity5 flight @entity182 dropped out of the sky and ploughed into a mountainside in the @entity5 at more than 400mph yesterday , killing all 150 people board			1
in the latest theory to emerge , it is thought the windscreen gave way , incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call			0
that may explain what happened in what top @entity5 official @entity195 has described as the crucial minute between 10.30am - when the pilots were apparently chatting away - and 10.31am when contact was lost			0
flight radar data revealed the plane started its nosedive at 10.31am from an altitude of 38,000 feet			0
however , experts are also discussing other theories including faulty speed sensors and technical problems related to the age of the aircraft			0
@entity210 's transport minister says work had begun on retrieving vital data from the cockpit voice recorder , although first pictures showed it had been badly damaged and it was not clear how much , if any , information could be analysed			0
this afternoon , the @entity216 named 28 - year - old @entity217 , originally from @entity218 , as one of the three @entity20 killed			2
another was earlier identified as @entity221 , a father - of - two and businessman from @entity223			0
@entity224 , a @entity109 - born mother from @entity62 , and her seven - month - old baby , @entity226 , who is a @entity20 national , were also among those who died .			2
