by @entity0 published : 08:26 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 09:32 est , 16 july 2013 @entity1 was once famed around the world for being home to a nation of gentle , mild - mannered folk who minded their ps and @entity8			1
but instead of using the age old phrase ' thank you ' to show our appreciation , we are now more likely to say ‘ cheers ’ , ‘ ta ’ or ‘ that ’s great ’			1
a new study has found terms such as ‘ cool ’ , ‘ brilliant ’ , ‘ lovely ’ and even ‘ boom ’ have firmly rooted themselves in our vernacular			0
boom ! like @entity20 , @entity1 have abandoned the well - worn phrase thank you in favour of less formal terms other common ways of offering thanks include ‘ you star ’ , ‘ super ’ , ‘ wicked ’ and ‘ okay ’			1
researchers found four in 10 people prefer not to say ' thank you ' because the phrase is too formal , while 13 per cent deem it ‘ old fashioned ’			1
of the 2,000 brits who took part in the study , which was commissioned by banking firm @entity33 to launch its new ' @entity34 ' campaign , 83 per cent thought more effort needed to be made to regularly show gratitude			1
an alarming six in 10 respondents believed @entity1 was now ' quite rude '			1
and while more than half felt appreciated by their partners , only five per cent felt loved by their bosses			2
danke but despite the apparent shift in our national psyche , two thirds of people still like to regularly appreciate others in everyday conversation , just not necessarily in the most traditional way			2
@entity33 's head of customer communications @entity69 said : ' the key thing to remember is that people still like to give and receive thanks , but in the modern world there are a million different ways to do this			0
' you ’ll probably find that people use different phrases to thank others , depending on what situation they are in and who they are speaking to			0
' so words such as boom , cool and wicked might be deemed appropriate with your mates , but not quite so suitable for a work setting , or when talking to an elder			0
' but being told you are appreciated , no matter how this is expressed - through words , cards , letters or otherwise - is a great feeling			0
' the study shows eight in 10 people believe others should always be thanked for kind actions , with 25 per cent saying it does n’t matter if it ’s just a little wave of acknowledgement			1
but a third of those polled admitted they probably could do with showing their appreciation a little more , such as buying someone flowers , sending a card , or sending a gift			2
we say thank you to shop workers ( 33 per cent ) more than our parents ( 26 per cent ) or teachers ( four per cent )			1
brits will most commonly thank someone when given change , when receiving a present or if someone buys them a drink			0
shop assistants are among the people we thank the most other actions which usually result in some form of thank you include someone holding the door open , someone telling you that you look great , or when someone saves a space for you			2
but when on the receiving end of thanks , 64 per cent say that just hearing those special words - or something similar - makes them feel that everything was worth the effort			0
ms @entity69 added : ' thanking people is something we ’re big on			0
' showing appreciation is a two way thing			0
our consistently great customer service means we get thanked regularly , and we also want to say a big thanks to all our customers for banking with us			0
' we all show appreciation in different ways - as long as it means something to the person on the receiving end and makes them feel good , that ’s all that matters			1

shop workers top the list of people we are prepared to thank
bosses are among the least likely to say the *golden* words ' thank you '
six in 10 believe @entity1 is now ' quite rude '
a third of people polled believed they needed to show more appreciation
