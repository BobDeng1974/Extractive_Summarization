@entity0 found a novel way of carrying on his duel in the second test with @entity4 here on thursday night when he sent him on his way with a military - style salute			1
@entity4 had given his wicket away just before the close of the third day when he smashed a @entity11 long - hop straight to deep square leg and @entity0 wasted no time in pouring salt on his wounds , saluting him on his way			1
the @entity17 all - rounder muttered under his breath as he walked past @entity0 before @entity19 closed on 373 for six , a lead of 74 , thanks to an outstanding unbeaten 118 from the prolific @entity22			1
