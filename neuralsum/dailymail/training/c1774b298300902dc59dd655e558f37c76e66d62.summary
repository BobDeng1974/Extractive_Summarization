@entity1 - @entity0 and her boyfriend @entity2 , who encouraged her to enter her first beauty pageant a woman who was subjected to a bullying ordeal due to her severe eczema has hit back against her tormentors - by being becoming a top beauty queen			1
@entity1 - @entity0 , 23 , endured daily taunts of ' snake skin ' throughout school due to the condition which affected her face and body and it left her desperately under - confident and considering self - harm			1

ms @entity0 , 23 , from @entity27 , @entity28 said : ' i was picked on every day at school because of my eczema and it shattered my confidence			1
i never dreamed i would have the courage to enter a beauty pageant , let alone win , but i 've finally shown the bullies that their words wo n't hold me back any more			1
' she was born with sore red patches of eczema covering her body and although doctors told her mother @entity45 that she would grow out of it , the condition only got worse			1
by the time she was a toddler , she was covered from head to toe in eczema			1
' it was really severe			2
my skin was always sticky and when my hair started to grow long , i had to have it cut short so it would n't get stuck to the eczema on my neck			1
' it was in my eyes and the creases of my arms and legs			2
@entity62 used to bandage my hands up at night so i could n't scratch myself in my sleep			2
i still try to sleep in gloves now to stop myself scratching , because it 's become such a habit			2
' ' in primary school it was n't as bad as you 're only children , but at high school the bullying got much worse			1
people would try and get away from me like i was contagious			1
we had to wear long - sleeved shirts so during the summer , i was always going to see the school nurse to put my eczema cream on and cool down			1
' that definitely did n't help			0
most of the bullying was during @entity82 lessons when i wore shorts and everyone could see the rash all over my legs			0
i hated it - i always tried to get out of @entity82 , which i regret now			2
' i sometimes got prank calls where the bullies would just laugh and hang up on me			0
i was tiny too , so they called me ' @entity92 '			0
as a child you ca n't forget the name - calling			2
' i never had a lot of friends			0
at my lowest point i was seeing the school counsellor			2
i had serious trust issues , ' she says			0
@entity1 - @entity0 poses for a photo wearing her miss @entity23 winner 's sash the 23 - year - old said she was terrified when taking part in the miss @entity23 competition			1
here she is pictured wearing her winner 's tiara and sash ( left ) and backstage before walking the catwalk ( right ) ms @entity0 often went to see a dermatologist as a teenager in an attempt to soothe her sore skin , but never found the ' wonder product ' she was hoping for			1
she said : ' i 've tried lots of types of aloe vera creams , cocoa butter , steroid cream			0
some of them seemed like the answer but as soon as my skin got used to them , they 'd stop working			0
i 've spent a shocking amount of time and money searching for the right skin products , because i have to be so careful with what i put on my face			2
' by her late teens , the eczema started to die down on its own and she started dating @entity2 , 23 , who assured her she was beautiful			1
mr @entity2 , as well as her family , persuaded the shy blonde to enter the regional beauty pageant last year			1
she said : ' i never thought i would have the confidence to do a pageant , but i had read that they involved a lot of charity work			0
i decided that even if i did n't do well , it would be good to do something for charity and it would give me more confidence			0
but in the end i do n't know what made me apply			0
something in me just said ' give it a go '			0
@entity1 - @entity0 pictured as a child with the eczema already visible on her face and arms she often went to see a dermatologist as a teenager in an attempt to soothe her sore skin ( pictured ) , but never found the ' wonder product ' she was hoping for			1
it eventually died down naturally after taking part in an interview , she was told she 'd made the final , which took place in february 2014			0
she said : ' walking down the catwalk in the final was really frightening			0
i suffer from anxiety so it felt like a huge amount of pressure , but i knew how proud my family would be			2
' when it was time to reveal the winner i started taking my shoes off , knowing i had n't won , and then they announced my name and started playing ' @entity180 ' by @entity181			0
you should have seen my face			2
' it was completely mad			0
i was sitting on a throne with this big crown on and my family were staring at me in amazement			0
i was extremely happy to have won it			0
it felt amazing to show the bullies what i could achieve , despite all their cruelty			0
' ms @entity0 was crowed miss @entity23 ( left ) after being urged to enter the competition by her boyfriend @entity2 ( pictured together right ) after being crowned miss @entity23 , she went on to compete in the @entity26 pageant in may , finishing in the top 20			1
here she is pictured with her mother ( centre ) and sister ( right ) after being crowned miss @entity23 , she went on to compete in the @entity26 pageant in may , finishing in the top 20			1

she said : ' two weeks before the final , i developed shingles in my eye socket			0

' i ended up in hospital for four days and the doctors advised me not to do the pageant but i made them give me a steroid cream so i could go ahead with it			0
i did n't want to miss the opportunity			2
thankfully my rash had faded when the final came around , but i still did n't feel back to full health			0
' since winning miss @entity23 , she has raised Â£ 700 for a local children 's charity and works as an ambassador for her local area			1
although ms @entity0 still battles bouts of eczema , becoming a beauty queen has shown her that her condition ca n't hold her back from achieving her dreams			1
' since doing miss @entity23 , getting involved in charity work and seeing how well i am compared to other people , it makes me feel lucky to even be here			1
