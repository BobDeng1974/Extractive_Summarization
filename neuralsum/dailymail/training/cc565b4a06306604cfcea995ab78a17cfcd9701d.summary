by @entity0 published : 07:34 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 07:44 est , 13 september 2012 for many people it might sound like the dream diet			2
but for one mother who exists solely on tea and biscuits , due to a rare condition which paralyses her stomach , it is a reality			1
@entity10 , 28 , can only drink three cups of tea and eat a handful of biscuits a day after developing gastroparesis			1
the condition prevents her stomach from contracting to digest food , meaning it takes her eight hours to process a meal - six times longer than a normal person			1
losing weight : @entity10 , 28 , can only drink three cups of tea and eat a handful of biscuits a day after developing gastroparesis the mother - of - one has dropped three stone in weight and has had to give up her shop selling baby clothes because of her condition			1
she has been forced to live on a tea and biscuit diet as she immediately begins to feel unwell if she eats or drinks anything else			2
mrs @entity10 , from @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , said her condition means she is left exhausted by walking her son @entity38 , four , just half a mile to school			1
she said : ' most days , i can only manage a tea and biscuit without feeling ill. i have lost so much weight			2
' on a good day , i can only manage a cup of tea and a biscuit for breakfast , the same again for lunch and maybe two tablespoons of mashed potato for dinner			0
i had to give up my business , i have no energy and i ’m constantly in hospital			0
' i ca n’t keep anything down and food is always getting stuck in my oesophagus and i have to make myself ill to get it back up again			1
' i have gone from a size 14 to a size 10 in the last year because of the lack of food			1
' it ’s a good job i was n’t a skinny girl to begin with , otherwise there would be nothing of me left now			0
i ca n’t go on like this , i need a pacemaker			0
' mrs kettle with her husband @entity70 in 2009 , before she contracted the disease			0
the mother - of - one has since dropped three stone in weight mrs @entity10 was forced to give up her shop selling baby clothes because of her condition and is desperate to have a special stomach pacemaker fitted			1
but she must go through a rigorous testing process to find out whether she is eligible for the £ 25,000 surgery on the @entity80			0
she first began to suffer nausea and pains in her stomach three years ago and went to @entity84 at @entity85 when the symptoms worsened			2
she was then hospitalised dozens of times and was misdiagnosed with gallstones , liver problems and even a psychiatric illness			0
in january last year , frustrated mrs @entity10 was given 20 injections directly into her stomach to relieve the pain but the effects were only temporary			1
she was left to suffer for another 18 months , not knowing what was causing her illness			0
mrs @entity10 , who lives with husband @entity70 , 29 , said : ' i started getting bad stomach pains and feeling tired all the time			1
i kept ending up in hospital which was hard for my son because he always worried i would never come out again			0
' eventually the specialist at the @entity103 said he did n’t know			0
basically a person ’s stomach normally contracts to digest food but my just does n’t			1
the food sits there like a lead weight			2
' if i have eaten even a tiny amount of rice the night before i still feel full the next day			0
' another cuppa : mrs @entity10 is desperate to have a special stomach pacemaker fitted , which will use an electric charge to stimulate the stomach muscles mr and mrs kettle with her son @entity117 in 2009			1
she must go through a rigorous testing process to find out whether she is eligible for the £ 25,000 surgery on the @entity80 in may this year , mrs @entity10 ’s confusion came to an end when she sought a second opinion from doctors at @entity125 ’s @entity124 and was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis			1
she said the origins of the condition remain a mystery in her case , with it normally affecting diabetes sufferers			2
but despite her illness , mrs @entity10 is determined to beat the condition and in two weeks ’ time will have a temporary pacemaker fitted through her nasal passages			1
the pacemaker will use an electric charge to stimulate the stomach muscles			2
the machine will be used for a week to monitor how it affects her diet and then consultations will begin for a permanent pacemaker to be placed in her stomach			2
mrs @entity10 said : ' the pacemaker stimulates the muscles to contract , which i need because it can take me 500 minutes to digest a small amount of plain rise or potato			1
' the operation is not covered on the @entity80 and i do n’t have £ 25,000 lying around so i do n’t know what i am going to do			0
' we ’ll see what the effects of the temporary effects are and we ’ll go from there			0
' i just want my quality of life back and a permanent pacemaker can give me that			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity125 and @entity167 said : ' before we carry out a permanent gastric pacemaker operation , patients undergo an extensive assessment including being fitted for a temporary pacemaker to help to evaluate the potential benefits of the device			0
' the reason for this extensive assessment is the highly specialist nature of the procedure and the need for the input of a very full multi-disciplinary team both prior to the procedure and during the operation itself			0
' * mrs @entity10 is holding a charity fashion show at @entity184 in @entity35 on sunday to raise money for charity @entity186 , which provides support and advice for sufferers and their families .			1
