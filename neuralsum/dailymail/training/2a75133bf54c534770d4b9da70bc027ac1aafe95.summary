@entity1 , from @entity12 in @entity13 , will need 24 - hour care for the rest of his life , mrs justice @entity11 was today told at a @entity18 hearing in @entity19			1
she gave her backing to a settlement - which included a £ 2million lump sum and annual payments of nearly £ 500,000 - agreed between lawyers representing @entity1 's parents @entity25 and @entity27 , and @entity28 in @entity29			1
mr and mrs @entity31 today called for the @entity32 to invest in better midwife training			1
law firm @entity34 , which represented the couple at the hearing , said in a statement after today 's hearing that problems arose during @entity1 's birth in october 2006			1
the newborn 's abnormal heartbeat ' was not acted upon ' , they said			2
the firm said a settlement had been agreed with the @entity45			0
' during his birth at the @entity48 in @entity29 in october 2006 , @entity1 ’s heart rate slowed drastically but medical staff failed to spot he was in distress and he was born 25 minutes later than he should have been , starving his brain of oxygen and leaving him permanently brain damaged , ' said an @entity34 spokesman in the statement			1
' ( we ) have now secured the family a £ 2 million lump sum to help cover costs of treatments , therapies , specialist equipment and adaptations that they need to their home			0
' @entity1 will also receive annual payments of up to £ 490,000 for the rest of his life			0
' this is believed to be the largest annual payment ever agreed and will be managed by @entity34 to ensure that the funds last for the correct amount of time			0
' he said the payments added up to a £ 12 million settlement			0
the spokesman said @entity1 - who was at today ’s hearing with his parents - suffered from cerebral palsy , epilepsy , had a severe learning disability , was registered blind and would need 24 - hour care , support and rehabilitation for the rest of his life			1
mrs @entity31 said : ' although nothing can turn back the clock and undo the mistakes made during @entity1 ’s birth , it is a massive relief to know that his care and rehabilitation needs for the rest of his life will be taken care of by the final settlement			1
' being thrust into this situation without any warning when @entity1 was born opened our eyes to the lack of support for new parents of babies with birth injuries			2
@entity1 , now seven years old , and pictured with his father @entity27 , suffers cerebral palsy , epilepsy , has a severe learning disability , was registered blind and needs 24 - hour care , support and rehabilitation for the rest of his life ' in the first few years we had to wade through all the administration and systems to apply for things such as therapies and chairs to help him sit up - thankfully now we will be able to support him using the settlement			1
' we are incredibly grateful to @entity34 for their support as we felt extremely isolated when we first left hospital			0
' there was very little help available and more needs to be done to assist parents who suddenly find themselves having to care for a baby who has suffered a birth injury as we did			0
' although nothing can turn back the clock and undo the mistakes made during @entity1 ’s birth , it is a massive relief to know that his care and rehabilitation needs for the rest of his life will be taken care of ' - @entity1 's mother , @entity31 ' all the current support for parents is focused on being a good mother to a ‘ normal ’ healthy baby and the last thing we wanted was to be around other parents whose situation did n’t bear any resemblance to our new lives			1
' we constantly had to battle to get support , equipment and therapies that @entity1 needed and it just highlights how important the settlement is in ensuring that his quality of life is as comfortable as possible for the rest of his life			2
' midwives need to be fully aware and accountable for the consequences of their actions within the delivery room			0
' for example , does the current midwifery training and ‘ updates ’ for qualified staff include meeting parents of children who had sustained life - changing injuries as a result of a mismanaged birth ? ' their practice and responsibility has to move away from the confines of the delivery room if the real impact and importance of their role is to be fully understood			2
' there has to be a shift towards doing everything they can to prevent babies being born with brain damage			2
' a high court judge has given her backing to a £ 12million compensation settlement agreed between lawyers acting for @entity181 and mrs @entity31 and the hospital trust			1
it includes a £ 2million lump sum and annual payments of £ 500,000 for the rest of his life @entity189 , a specialist medical negligence lawyer at @entity34 , said @entity1 ’s parents had been ' incredibly resilient '			2
' the mistakes made during his birth were unacceptable and have had a life - changing effect not just on @entity1 , but the entire family and all those close to them , ' she said			0
' he will be dependent on carers forever and it was vital that they received the support they needed			0
' mrs justice @entity11 told @entity181 and mrs @entity31 at the hearing the she hoped the money would give the family a better quality of life			2
' i know you have battled on @entity1 ’s behalf , ' said the judge			0
' i hope that what this money does is to give you some peace of mind			0
' there is at least in place some financial stability			0
i know nothing can turn the clock back			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity45 said : ' we are sorry that the care afforded to mrs @entity31 and to @entity1 fell below an acceptable standard and that @entity1 suffered very substantial injuries as a result			1
' the trust acknowledges that no amount of money can compensate adequately for the damage suffered but it is hoped at least that the agreed sum will give some financial security and provide for @entity1 's needs now and in the future			1
