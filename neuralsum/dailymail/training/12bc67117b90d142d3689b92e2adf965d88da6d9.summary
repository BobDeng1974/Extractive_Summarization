by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:07 pm on 3rd december 2011 a prudent pensioner is preparing to celebrate the festive season with the same christmas tree that he has used for the past 74 years			2
@entity5 was bought the dishevelled 3ft tree by his late mother when he was just three - months - old			2
but the artificial tree , made out of wood , wire and green quilled feathers , has lasted so well @entity5 and wife @entity12 have brought it out every @entity14 since 1937			1
traditional : @entity5 , left , his daughter @entity15 , @entity15 and @entity16 , his great grandson , with the tree which mr @entity5 has used for the past 74 years incredibly , they still use five baubles and the angel that came with the miniature tree more than seven decades ago for decorations today			1
the couple have also saved money on their fairy lights as the 20 coloured ones wrapped around the fragile tree are still going strong after 31 years			1
the last decorations @entity5 and mrs @entity15 bought for the tree were wooden teddy bears and elephants about 25 years ago			2
the tree is so ancient that four years ago a local history museum put it on display			2
every year 74 - year - old mr @entity5 , a great - grandfather , places the fragile tree on his lounge windowsill and bans any member of his family from touching it in case it falls apart			2
ready to celebrate : other festive celebrations are not quite as traditional as mr @entity5 's as this lights and fireworks display in @entity48 's @entity47 shows after @entity14 the couple , from @entity50 , near @entity51 , @entity52 , gently wrap the tree in polystyrene , place it in a bag and store it in their loft for safekeeping			1
they do n't even take off the decorations because they are afraid of wrecking it			0
after taking it out of storage for its 75th @entity14 , retired lorry driver @entity5 said : ' every year i look in the bag its wrapped in to see if its still in one piece			1
' we have to be so careful when we lift it onto the windowsill but it amazes me just how well it has lasted			0
' we do have a 5ft christmas tree which we bought five years but i doubt that will last a fraction of the time as my old one			0
' mr @entity5 's mum @entity75 paid seven shillings and six pence for the christmas tree which she bought in @entity79			0
when mr @entity5 married @entity12 he took the tree with him and it has since lasted six house moves			0
mrs @entity15 , 72 , said : ' the little tree is part of the family and it would n't be @entity14 without it			1
' five of the baubles are the same age as the tree and the fairy lights are more than 30 years old			1
we have n't even had to change any of the bulbs			0
' we keep the tree in a bag in the loft and leave on the decorations on otherwise it would fall apart			0
' in these hard times when people are struggling for cash they should take a leaf out of our book and keep hold of their @entity14 trees for as long as possible			1
' the couple have two children , seven grandchildren and four great - grandchildren			0
mrs @entity15 added : ' the kids love it and every december they ask us when we are going to put it up but we get more excited about it then they get			0
