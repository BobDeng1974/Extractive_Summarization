by @entity0 last updated at 9:51 am on 6th march 2012 sex offenders will face tougher checks , ministers announced today - after the @entity4 revealed more than 850 are on the run from the police			1
the @entity7 will close a string of loopholes in the official register of sex criminals - including one which allowed offenders to register their address as a park bench			1
homeless sex offenders who did not have a permanent address were able to nominate a public place where they slept as their home and keep it for an entire year			1
slipped through the net : serial rapist @entity21 , left , had been off the police radar when he went on to rape and murder trainee nurse @entity21 , 17 in future they will be forced to check in with the police every week and notify the authorities if they are moving around			1

in the past notification was not required for holidays shorter than three days			0
they must also tell the police if they move into a house where a child lives , and notify officers of any attempts to change their name by deed poll			1
the crack down comes after figures , released following a @entity46 request , showed 700 sex offenders have been missing for more than a year , and one has been at large for nearly a decade			1
the @entity7 will close loopholes in the official register of sex criminals , including one which allowed offenders to register their address as a park bench the total means the number of perverts who have vanished from the radar has more than doubled in just two years			2
the figures raised serious concerns about the extent of police checks on criminals placed on the official @entity66 , and efforts to find them once they have absconded			2
victims ’ groups said the register was ‘ out of control ’ and warned that sex offenders were getting away with staying ‘ underground and undetected ’			1
anyone given a jail sentence of 30 months or more for a sex crime , ranging from repeated indecent exposure to rape , is automatically placed on the register for life			2
there are now more than 37,000 names on it			0
wanted : @entity84 , left , and @entity85 , right , are the only two missing child sex offenders listed by the @entity87 but figures show that on september 1 last year a total of 843 had disappeared			1
of those , some 690 had been untraceable for more than 12 months			0
on the same day in 2009 there were just 356 registered sex offenders at large , fewer than half the 2011 number			1
the numbers at large for more than a year have also more than doubled			2
two years ago the total stood at 260			0
now the figures released following a @entity46 request to the @entity100 show more than one in 50 of all those on the register are missing			1
separate figures reveal that 57 registered sex offenders were charged with a further offence last year			1

@entity21 posed as a teenager on the internet to lure the trainee nurse to her death			0
he was jailed for life in 2010			0
@entity117 , of @entity118 and @entity119 , said : ‘ the figures do n’t surprise me because nobody has really had a control of the sex offenders register since it was brought in			1
‘ these people are offenders who want to move around and remain underground and undetected			2
‘ but all the blame for this can not be put at the doors of the police			0
how many paedophiles can be tracked down when the police are being asked to do so much paperwork ? ’ home secretary @entity133 said the ruling for sex offenders to be taken of the register after an amount of time was ' appalling ' despite the huge numbers of criminals at large , barely a handful of sex offenders are listed on police wanted websites			1
the ‘ most wanted ’ page of the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) website shows the details of just two missing child sex offenders			1
@entity84 , 35 , has been missing for four years			0

he served 18 months and was released from jail in 1998 , when he moved to @entity154			0
police said decisions on whether to publicise individual offenders would depend on the circumstances in each case , and work was being done behind the scenes to hunt offenders down			2
@entity164 assistant chief constable @entity163 , spokesman for the @entity165 on the management of sexual offenders , said monitoring was working and fewer serious offences were being committed by dangerous offenders			0
she said : ‘ the @entity171 has some of the most effective techniques in the world to manage registered sex offenders			1
’ ministers have also announced the process by which sex offenders will be able to challenge their inclusion on the register for life			1
all offenders placed on the register indefinitely have been given appeal rights following a human rights judgment by the @entity185 in 2010			0
from later this year , adults who have been on the register for 15 years will be able to appeal to the police and if there is no evidence they remain a threat , they will be taken off			2
if the decision goes against them they will be given a right of appeal to the @entity196 who could overturn the police ruling			0
the @entity185 agreed with two convicted sex offenders that no right of review was ' incompatible ' with their right to privacy			1
home secretary @entity133 said the ruling was ' appalling ' and ' seems to fly completely in the face of common sense ' .			0
