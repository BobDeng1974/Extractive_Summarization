cinemas throughout the country were ordered to suspend the film , which has been a blockbuster in the @entity14 and the @entity15 , even after it was given the all - clear by communist censors			2
employees at two outlets in @entity20 said an order by the importer , @entity22 , cited an unspecified ' technical ' problem			0
however , there were some suggestions on @entity6 social media sites that the postponement was related to a nude scene featuring the film 's lead actor , @entity30 , it was reported by @entity32			1
the sudden decision comes despite weeks of promotion for the violent slave - revenge saga in @entity6 , which is now the world 's second biggest movie market			1
slave revenge saga : @entity30 plays the title role in @entity2 , which has been pulled from @entity6 cinemas on its opening day , despite weeks of promotion for the film in the country too much for @entity6 : the film was apparently pulled because of this scene featuring a naked @entity30 being hung upside down while being tortured the employees would not give their full names and calls to @entity22 and the government 's film regulatory agency were unanswered , the @entity47 reported			1
some violent scenes had already been cut from @entity2 to get it passed @entity6 's rigorous censorship			1

director @entity4 in his cameo : the decision to pull the film comes even after @entity4 oversaw a process of toning down some of @entity73 's more violent scenes to get it past @entity6 's strict censorship a spokesman for the @entity6 branch of @entity78 , the film 's distributor , told the @entity80 : ' these slight adjustments will not affect the basic quality of the film – such as tuning the blood to a darker colour , or lowering the height of the splatter of blood			2
' @entity4 knew how to adjust that , and it 's necessary that he is the one to do it			0
you can give him suggestions , but it must be him who does [ the tuning ]			0
' with such an exacting system in place the suspension of a film 's @entity6 première date is unusual			2
it 's not the first @entity2 première to be postponed			0
the film , which stars @entity30 in the title role , is so violent that the production company behind it decided to cancel its @entity107 premiere in december out of respect to the victims of the @entity110 .			0
