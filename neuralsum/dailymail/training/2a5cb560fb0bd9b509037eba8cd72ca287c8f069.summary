spoon - bending ' psychic ' @entity0 believes that thanks to its status as a ' balanced ' number , ' 11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond ' there are some on the outer fringes of the internet who say it heralds the @entity15 ; but for others , it looks like the perfect day for a wedding at 11.11.11 on 11.11.11 , the time and date will be a perfect same - numbered palindrome , reading the same backwards as forwards , an event which can only happen on one day every 100 years			1
and even the most hardened sceptic will surely pause for a moment to reflect on the unique occurrence , which will not come around again in the lifetime of most of us			0
among other things , 11.11.11 will be : the reason the date is so unusual is that 11.11.11 is the only double - figure palindromic date , since there is no 22nd month			0
and the last time it happened , on november 11 1911 , an almost supernatural event saw temperatures drop by more than @entity38 in a single day			1
this was the @entity40 , a cold snap which hit the @entity42 causing blizzards and tornadoes as well as record falls in temperature			0
in @entity48 , it was as warm as @entity50 ( @entity49 ) in the morning - but this had dropped to @entity52 ( -12c ) by the end of the day			1
remembrance : november 11 is best known in the @entity55 as @entity56 , or @entity57 in the @entity42 a new film being released on friday , entitled simply 11 - 11 - 11 , predicts that the day will see the opening of a portal in to @entity61 , and says : ' on this day , innocent blood will spill			1
' the film by @entity64 , director of several entries in the saw franchise , features a man whose family dies in a car crash at 11.11am , and who then begins to be haunted by the number 11			1
it plays on beliefs long held by some spiritualists , who say that the number has a special significance and claim that many people have a mystical attraction to the time 11.11			1
horror : today sees the release of apocalyptic film 11 - 11 - 11 , which predicts the opening of a hellmouth one group believes that 11.11 is the special symbol of the ' @entity85 ' , a group of 1,111 celestial beings who supposedly look after mortals and manifest themselves in mid-morning			1
spoon - bending ' psychic ' @entity0 has written that the number represents ' the need to find balance in life ' , and added : ' when i see the number 1111 , i pray for sick children and world peace			1
' @entity99 : the romantic town in the @entity101 will have an upswing in marriages on 11.11.11 he also believes that thanks to its status as a ' balanced ' number , ' 11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and the key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond '			2
however , most of those who have chosen this friday as a day to get married are more attracted by the pleasing coincidence than by any deeper significance			1
the small town of @entity99 , a traditional wedding venue near the border between @entity120 and @entity121 , will host at least 50 weddings on 11.11.11 , compared to fewer than a dozen on a typical november friday			0
wedding mania will be even more pronounced overseas , such as in @entity125 where thousands of couples have judged the date to be auspicious for a successful marriage			0
@entity129 , a @entity130 journalist who is getting married in @entity131 on friday , said that it ' means a lot to be able to get married on such a historical date			2
' she added : ' we chose 11.11.11 for our wedding day because it 's a date which nobody , including my rather absent - minded fianc√© , will ever forget			1
' trousers : one group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the @entity144 , which has anointed 11.11.11 as ' @entity145 ' because it is made up of straight lines the day will also be one of celebration for a number of children who will be turning 11 on 11.11.11			1
for @entity152 , of @entity153 in @entity154 , it will be even more special , as she sees in her 11th birthday at her house - number 11			1
most famously , the 11th of november is @entity56 in the @entity55 - @entity57 in the @entity42 - when we celebrate the end of @entity159 and commemorate the victims of that war and subsequent ones			1
the reason we ascribe significance to 11.11.11 is apophenia - the urge to find patterns in seemingly random data			2
it is this that explains why we see clouds forming certain shapes , and why we often hear of people finding ' faces ' in things like potato crisps			0
@entity177 is also important in the psychology of gamblers			0
it can either encourage those on a winning streak to believe that it will continue , or convince losing gamblers that their luck must inevitably change			0
while it can be a symptom of mental illness if taken to an extreme - as depicted in the film a beautiful mind - apophenia is instinctive to all humans as a way of drawing conclusions about the world			2
this phenomenon helps us , for example , to recognise abstract drawings as representing human figures , and to remember phone numbers which seem to follow a pattern			0
the end of the @entity159 came on november 11 , 1918			2
given the carnage seen in the war , we can assume that the date was not deliberately chosen , but was simply the earliest possible opportunity for a ceasefire			0
however , the decision to end the war at exactly 11 o'clock certainly was deliberate , at the @entity210 was signed around five in the morning ( @entity211 time ) , to take effect at the symbolic point a few hours later			2
tragically , fierce fighting continued right up until the official ceasefire , and one @entity42 soldier was killed at 10.58			0
of course , there is no real significance to the date 11.11.11 - not even at the time of 11.11.11 - but it is a classic example of apophenia , the human urge to see patterns in essentially random events			2
with that in mind , perhaps the group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the @entity144 , which has anointed 11.11.11 as ' @entity145 ' because it is made up of straight lines			0
however , to say that the date is no more than a coincidence would have provided little comfort to those who endured the bizarre weather on the last 11.11.11			0
it remains to be seen whether 11.11.11 will produce such surprises this time around , but people should be sure to keep a careful eye on the weather - and on any local @entity239 - at 11 seconds past 11 minutes past 11 o'clock .			0

only occurs on one day every 100 years
@entity56 , celebrated around the world .
a day of spiritual significance for those who believe the number 11 has a mystical power .
a very special day to get married or have a birthday ( especially if it 's your 11th ) .
perhaps even the @entity15 , according to some ' *prophecy* ' web forums .
