ageist comments about @entity3 's fall at the @entity4 could deter firms from hiring older women , a government adviser claims today			1
older workers ' tsar @entity7 said the reaction to the 56 - year - old 's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony ' encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate '			1

she failed to untie her cape in time for her dancers to rip it away as she took to the stage at @entity25 's @entity31			1
some onlookers praised her at the time for continuing to sing her new song , living for love , as proof of her professionalism after more than three decades in the business			0
but others argued that the embarrassing incident was proof that she should rethink her stage persona			0
mrs @entity7 said the media coverage after the fall was typical of the way age is treated			1
she told @entity45 : ' much is often made of achievement with a reference to age			0
' it 's not uncommon to hear that ' despite ' someone being a certain age they have achieved something commendable			2
' the recent example of ageist comments after @entity3 fell off the stage at the @entity4 encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate			1
' @entity58 was nothing to do with her age and could have happened to any performer of any age			2
' the pop superstar was dragged to the ground as she attempted to undo her @entity66 cape which was pulled by a dancer @entity3 later laughed off the incident and said her @entity66 cape was simply tied ' too tight '			1

' older workers ' tsar @entity7 said the reaction to the 56 - year - old 's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony ' encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate ' mrs @entity7 's report , expected to be released tomorrow , will call for urgent action to improve the chances of older workers			1

it includes using pictures of the very elderly and frail to illustrate stories about people in their 50s or 60s			0
ministers are also warned that older women are more likely to lose their roles as main newsreaders than men			0
mrs @entity7 added : ' the majority of people in their 50s and 60s are not old			2
' but media stories about older people often use clips or stock images representing much more elderly and frail people			0
' wizened hands and walking sticks are not appropriate depictions of older people and merely reinforce negative discriminatory stereotypes			0
' minister for pensions @entity121 said : ' beyond the age of fifty , people start falling out of the workplace at dramatic rates â€“ but there is a compelling economic and business case for overcoming these obstacles to access this vast untapped talent in the @entity131 labour market			0
' the government has made a good start by abolishing the default retirement age and extending the right to request flexible working			0
but it is clear that old - fashioned and outdated perceptions still persist			0
