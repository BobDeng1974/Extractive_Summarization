by @entity0 published : 07:39 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 13:05 est , 21 may 2012 it 's been going for just three days and 115 miles but the @entity2 has already burnt out , organisers confirmed today			2
shortly before 10am the torch that was attached to the side of @entity7 star @entity6 's wheelchair went out during his leg of the relay in @entity10 , @entity11			1
but just up the road in @entity14 , an extremely unofficial torch kept burning despite the wind			1
looking rather perilous against a row of thatched cottages , the flaming fireball on a stick was paraded through the small market town in the locally organised event			2
back in @entity10 , a spokeswoman for @entity23 said : ' the flame went out due to a malfunctioning burner			1
the 86 - year - old from @entity45 , @entity11 , had been due to carry the flame ahead of the 1948 @entity47 but was struck down with appendicitis			1
as the torch came through @entity50 in @entity51 that year he was on the operating table			2
but today a healthy mr @entity42 held the golden torch aloft during his leg of the relay through @entity56 in @entity11			1
it had been ' an honour ' he said			0
speaking about missing out in 1948 , mr @entity42 added : ' i was in the @entity61 cross-country championships in @entity62 a few days before and collapsed with appendicitis			0
' i never thought i 'd get another chance when i was in @entity65 on the day i was meant to be carrying the torch in 1948			1
' ' it is not uncommon for a flame to go out and this can happen for a number of reasons , for example , in extreme winds			1
' a replacement torch was brought out from the convoy of vehicles and was lit from the mother flame			1
' we keep the mother flame in specially designed miners ' lanterns so if the flame does go out for some reason on the relay we relight it from the source of the flame , ' the spokeswoman added			1
mr @entity6 was left paralysed at 19 when he was struck by a car			2
but after returning to college to complete his a levels he looked at what sports were available to wheelchair athletes and helped to set up a badminton club			0
with his playing partner , @entity6 has been unbeaten for three years in the four nations competitions and he is now the @entity7 world no 1 in his class			2
the torch relay entered its third day today and will see dozens of unsung and hard - working individuals get their moment in the spotlight as they carry the torch from @entity105 to @entity50			2
however , some of the @entity2 torchbearers have caused a stir after cashing in on their once - in - a - lifetime privilege by selling their torches on @entity111			0
before the first day of the relay was completed , the gold torches appeared on the online auction @entity115 torch used during the relay on saturday is currently attracting bids of more than £ 30,000			0
the seller lists the item as : ' an amazing sporting souvenir , be one of the first to have one ! ' other torchbearers have pledged to donate the proceeds from the sale to charity			0
@entity127 , from @entity128 , who is selling her torch to raise money for the project she represents , said she had received a bid of more than £ 150,000			0
ms @entity133 said she still needed to check if the bid was genuine			0
' it only occurred to me to do it on saturday night , ' she told @entity138			0
' the sale closed last night at 10pm and the final bid was £ 153,000			0
' the torchbearer , who was nominated for her work as a community gardener for the @entity145 's plot , said she was dismayed that people who objected to her decision had started sending her abusive emails			0
torch fever : the crowds were back today to watch @entity151 carrying the @entity2 on the leg between @entity153 and @entity154 in @entity11 we want the torch ! school children enjoy a break from their lessons to watch the torch pass them in @entity153 , @entity11 patience : a british bulldog decked out in red , white and blue waits patiently for the touch in @entity166 , left , while right , crowds gather on a bridge between @entity168 and @entity169 ' obviously it has really upset people but i think that it 's not something that is really me to keep my shiny trophy on a mantelpiece when it is obvious how much good one can do with the money that someone might be willing to pay for it			1
' organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the scenes on the first two days of the relay when excited people packed the streets of @entity187 and @entity11 to catch a glimpse of the torch			1
yesterday began at the @entity190 with the torch in the hands of 18 - year - old @entity193			0
the relay travelled from @entity190 , through @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity168 on the south @entity11 coast , before finishing in @entity105 for an evening celebration			2
more than 8,500 people filled @entity200 to watch a live show of music and dance			0
away from the official @entity2 , residents in @entity14 , @entity11 got on with some burning of their own			2
but perhaps holding a flaming fireball on a stick close to a row of pretty thatched cottages was not quite a gold medal idea			0
as crowds of local residents lined the streets of the small market town clapping the unofficial torch bearers down the street , thick black smoke filled the air			1
luckily the event passed without incident			0
and what 's more the unofficial torch , which must have cost a fraction of the £ 495 price of a golden cheese grater , did not malfunction , despite the wind			1
bit close for comfort : a man bearing his own rather ambitious torch waves it close to a line of thatched cottages during an unofficial spin - off gathering in @entity14 , @entity11 has one been working out ? crowds lined the streets of @entity14 for the race run ahead of the official @entity2 relay			1

para-badminton star @entity6 had been carrying torch through @entity10 , @entity11 when it went out
replacement torch was brought out and lit from ' mother flame '
' not uncommon for flame to go out , ' says @entity23 spokesman
but highly unofficial torch continues to burn at event 13 miles away
