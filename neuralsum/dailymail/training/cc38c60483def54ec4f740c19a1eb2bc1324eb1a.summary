humans in @entity1 were harvesting and eating cereals 7,000 years ago - several centuries earlier than previously thought			1
the discovery was made after researchers found ancient barley and wheat residues on teeth of skeletons from two @entity10 cemeteries in @entity11 and @entity12			1
it is believed wheat was first cultivated in the @entity15 about 10,500 years ago and spread out from there to @entity11 and @entity17 as well as to @entity18 and @entity1 - the latter faster than expected			1
humans in @entity1 were harvesting and eating cereals 7,000 years ago - several centuries earlier than previously thought			1
pictured is one of the graves at the @entity10 cemetery in @entity12 ( @entity11 ) , containing a skeleton and plant material deposited behind the skull ( white structure at the left of the image ) ' with our results we can verify that people along the @entity33 did not only exploit gathered wild plants and animals , but even crops of barley and wheat , ' said dr @entity39 out from @entity40			1
' the diversity of the diet was much greater than previously assumed , ' he added			2
' the fact that grains were placed in the graves of the deceased implies that they had a special , symbolic meaning			0
' mineral plant particles , dubbed phytoliths , survive over thousands of years , even when other plant remains have been destroyed			2
plant particles found during the excavation of this @entity10 cemetery in @entity12 ( @entity11 ) turned out to be traces of domestic cereals when analysed in a lab the skeleton of an young woman who lived in @entity59 2,000 years ago shows that coeliac disease existed far longer than thought			1
the woman 's remains were found in an ancient tomb at the @entity66 archaeological site on the @entity59 coast in @entity68			0
researcher said the woman was affluent - and even tried to eat a paleo diet to deal with her problem			2
the skeleton of the woman showed signs of malnutrition and osteoporosis			0
both can be complications of untreated coeliac disease , which is characterised by a severe allergic reaction to gluten in the intestinal lining			0
many of the woman 's bones were eroded at the tips , and she would have stood just 140 centimetres ( 4 feet , 7 inches ) tall			0
after discovering these particles , the research team used , among other things , a special high - quality light microscope as well as radiocarbon analysis to determine their age			0
' the finds reveal new information on the diet of these human groups , indicating a diverse intake of grains , cereals , various millets and legumes , ' explained the researchers			0
' [ the area ] is dominated by domestic @entity103 cereals and provides rare evidence of the cultivation of crop plants in a society whose economy has been considered mainly pastoral			0
' they added that the cemetery also provides the first evidence in @entity1 for the use of the near - eastern wheat and barley crop use			1
the study follows separate research , earlier this year , which found that ancient @entity118 ate a diet composed largely of vegetables , fruit , wheat and barley			1
a team of researchers from the @entity126 studied carbon atoms in 45 mummies of people that lived in @entity118 between @entity131 and @entity132			2
they found that they ate a lot of barley and wheat over the long period , suggesting that they adapted to the region incredibly well			0
the finding also echoes many paintings in @entity118 tombs that show people working the land and harvesting wheat to make loaves of bread , which are often offered to the god of the afterlife , @entity148			2
the discovery was made after researchers found ancient wheat ( left ) and barley ( right ) residues on teeth of skeletons from two @entity10 cemeteries in @entity11 and @entity12 @entity157 shows some of the locations in @entity118 and @entity11 that were excavated			1
this study focused on @entity160 and @entity161			0
' with our results we can verify that people along the @entity33 did not only exploit gathered wild plants and animals but even crops of barley and wheat , ' said dr @entity39 out from @entity40			1

wheat was first cultivated in the @entity15 about 10,500 years ago
it reached @entity1 sooner than arriving in @entity11 and @entity17
study means people living close to @entity33 had a far more varied diet
