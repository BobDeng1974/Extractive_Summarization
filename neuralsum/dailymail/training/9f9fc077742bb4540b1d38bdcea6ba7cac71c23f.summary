in the suit , @entity8 claims the abuse started when he was 14 or 15 and moved to @entity13 with his family to start his acting career			2
it was in @entity13 that he was introduced to another @entity19 powerplayer , @entity36 and his lover @entity37 , he claims			0
@entity8 was invited to one of @entity40 - @entity36 's ' notorious ' parties held at his home , dubbed the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			2
according to the suit , the parties were well - known in @entity19 and attended by investors in @entity49 's company who lured young boys as part of a ' sordid sex ring '			0
@entity40 - @entity36 eventually faced justice himself , admitting in court in 2004 that he lured five minors across state lines for sexual purposes			0
while these parties allegedly ' featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys ' , @entity8 maintains he ' never freely ' consented to the advances			0
it was two or three months after @entity40 - @entity36 began allegedly abusing @entity8 that he was introduced to @entity1 at one of the parties			1
@entity8 was in the pool when @entity40 - @entity36 approached him and ordered him out to hug @entity1			1
@entity8 was nude , as per the rules of the house pool , so when he hugged @entity1 the director allegedly ' grabbed his bare buttocks '			1
@entity8 claims the three then went to a jacuzzi where he was ordered to sit on @entity40 - @entity36 's lap before being passed off to @entity1			1
he allegedly promised the then 17 - year - old victim a role in one of the movies back in 1999			1
above , a poster for @entity1 's latest film , due out next month @entity8 claims @entity1 brought him an alcoholic beverage , even though he was under age , and then promised him a part in one of the upcoming movies he was directing			1
he spoke about the people at the party , saying ' this group ' controls @entity19			0
according to the lawsuit , @entity1 told @entity8 he was ' sexy ' and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him			1

that allegedly caused @entity1 to push the boy 's head under water			0
when he finally got up for air , @entity1 again demanded he perform oral sex and when he refused for the second time , @entity1 took him out of the pool and forcibly sodomized him , @entity8 says			2
the suit also refrences two trips @entity8 went on with @entity1 to @entity4 when he was 17 years old			1

scene of the crime ? @entity8 was allegedly taken on two trips to @entity4 with @entity1 where they stayed at the @entity104 resort , entrance pictured above			1
however , those claims are now in question he even promised him a part in an @entity74 movie he was directing			0
@entity1 first started directing the comic book adaptations in 2000			0
in 1999 , when the @entity4 trips happened , the director would have been around 33 years old			2
@entity8 and his lawyer are scheduled to hold a press conference about the new lawsuit thursday in @entity13			0
they 've filed in @entity4 , however , since the statue of limitations to file a suit is longer there and would have expired next week			0
in response , @entity132 , a lawyer for the director , said ' it is obvious that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity , ' ahead of the film 's release			2
' the claims made against @entity1 are completely without merit			0
we are very confident that @entity1 will be vindicated in this absurd and defamatory lawsuit			0

the *48* - year - old director was hit with a lawsuit filed wednesday in @entity4
victim @entity8 is now 31 , but was 17 years old when @entity1 carried out some of the alleged abuse
