in a scathing letter to the director - general lord hall , she expressed her anger at presenter @entity12 ’s remarks about @entity13 singles champion @entity14			1
mrs @entity2 , who also called for better coverage of women ’s sport , demanded updates on ‘ further action that is likely to be taken ’ over the comments , which prompted hundreds of complaints to the @entity7			1
earlier this month @entity20 , who is thought to be paid about £ 600,000 a year , said of @entity22 during coverage of the @entity13 women ’s final : ‘ i just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12 , 13 , 14 maybe : “ listen , you are never going to be , you know , a looker			1
‘ “ you are never going to be somebody like a [ @entity2 ] @entity31 , you ’re never going to be 5 feet 11 , you ’re never going to be somebody with long legs , so you have to compensate for that			1
you are going to have to be the most dogged , determined fighter that anyone has ever seen on the tennis court if you are going to make it			0
” and she kind of is			0
’ the comments generated more than 700 complaints , and led to demands that @entity20 should be sacked			1
but the 55 - year - old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the @entity48 champion , and apologising on - air the day after the final			1
the beleaguered presenter faced criticism several years ago after he seemed to joke about the @entity57 ’s appearance mrs @entity2 ’s letter is her second major intervention over women in sport in recent weeks			1

she told @entity69 : ‘ i am writing to express my concern over the comments made by @entity12 about @entity14 , during the @entity7 ’s radio coverage of the @entity13 women ’s final			1
’ she added : ‘ it is ... a matter of some concern to me that any comment on the looks and stature of a female athlete could be made in the context of one of the highlights of the @entity84 ’s , and indeed the world ’s , sporting calendar			1
‘ i am sure you will agree with me that it is vital that young women and girls in this country feel motivated both to take part in and to watch coverage of sport , and to know that they are included in the enjoyment of sport , and catered for by the media just as much as the male audience			2
‘ whilst i note that mr @entity12 has apologised both on - air and in writing to ms @entity14 , i would be grateful for an update on any further action that is likely to be taken following [ the ] complaints , and whether there may be positive steps that the @entity7 could take in the future to ensure that the perception of and commentary on female athletes , and women ’s sport generally , are as positive and inclusive as possible			1
’ the 55 - year - old escaped severe sanction by writing a letter of apology to the @entity48 champion , and apologising on - air the day after the final culture secretary @entity2 demanded to know what action the @entity7 was taking over sexism claims the letter was also copied to the chairman of the @entity120 , @entity121			1

speaking on his @entity127 phone - in , he said : ' of course it ’s not the role of politicians to start second - guessing what every single journalist and every single reporter says , but of course we ’ve got to be clear that what we do n’t want is sexism in sport and we do n’t want that reflected in the way it ’s supported			2
' he also condemned @entity66 's male only membership policy as ' inexplicable ' and ' anachronistic '			2
' i was just dismayed and incredibly surprised to hear this still goes on in this day and age			0
' i find it so out of step with everything else that 's happening in the rest of society			0
' i think many people will just shake their head and say " how on earth is this still possible in this day and age ? "			0

the letter was also copied to the chairman of the @entity120 , @entity121 the spokesman also stressed that the @entity7 has appointed an ‘ editorial lead ’ for women ’s sport ‘ which has helped ensure significantly increased coverage across our daily sporting output ’ , while the company as a whole ‘ is taking steps to clearly communicate to those who work for us what constitutes inappropriate behaviour or language ’			2

’ asked if there was any difference between only allowing men and only allowing white people , he said : ‘ there ’s a massive difference between racial discrimination , anti-semitism , where sectors of society are downtrodden and treated very badly			0
