@entity22 held an exclusive q&a with the forward after he found out about the accolade			1
@entity0 has scooped the @entity26 for march congratulations , @entity0			1
how would you describe your style of play at @entity3 ? hold up play , roll the defender			1
and i 've got a good burst of acceleration ! who do you look up to in the first team ? @entity37 ( @entity38 )			2
i grew up with @entity37 so to see him come through the youth ranks , he 's definitely my role model			2
do you train with them often ? i do , but not as much as i 'd like to			0
your record at @entity3 reads one game , one goal			1
how did that come about ? i was a first year and i scored 20 goals that season			1
they had nothing to play for [ against @entity49 ] so they chucked me up there , and i came on and scored ! how often do you speak to @entity20 ? not too much this season , he 's a busy guy ! but when he has a chance to come talk to me , he comes and talks to me			2
is your goal to make it at @entity3 next season , or go out on loan ? i 'm @entity3 born and bred and my goal is to make the first team , that 's all i 've ever wanted to do , it 's not about going anywhere else to me			1
i 'd love for us to stay in the @entity64 , and i believe i can handle it			0
@entity0 hopes to make @entity3 's first team in the @entity64 and has grown up nearby how do you relax away from football ? chill with my friends , i 'm around some really good people			1
on to that international hat - trick ... how did you get to play for @entity16 ? my mum and grandma are from @entity16 , and my grandma passed away when i was younger - so making the choice to play for them came from the heart			1
what was the reaction when you came back ? everyone 's jealous when i go away ( laughs ) , but they were still really happy			0
@entity83 manager @entity82 [ @entity84 ] could n't stop looking at me for a week ! where did you play , and what was it like ? @entity88 and @entity89			0
it was really hot ! when you go to the @entity91 , you either have to train at 7am or at night time			0
the players in the @entity91 are much stronger and really quick , so you have to think quick - that 's all it is			2
some of them are n't the best players but they have certainly got a lot of strength so you 've got to adapt to that			0
any @entity16 players you would tip to make it ? @entity105 from @entity106 , he 's technically brilliant			1
i think he 'll get a move this summer because he 's really good			0
and our captain is doing great with @entity111 in the @entity112 right now , @entity113			0
there 's a few others from @entity116 , who could definitely be higher up but they just have n't been seen			0
@entity0 posted this picture on @entity118 with the caption ' motherland ' while he was away on international duty last album you listened to ? i went to the @entity124 concert the other day [ in @entity125 [ so has to be @entity124 last film ? fast and furious 7 ... emotional to be fair			2
last holiday ( apart from your international break ! ) ? @entity130 a player you would tip to make it at @entity3 ? @entity135 ( @entity134 international ) best advice you 've received from a first team player ? i remember @entity141 once speaking to me			2
he said when you come and make an impression , do n't worry about what anyone has to say and just make sure you 're seen			0
keep working hard , going to the gym , keep practicing			0
best player you 've ever played against ? @entity150 , he 's got great feet , we played him a tournament a couple of years ago			0
for how tall he is it 's actually amazing , and his finishing is on point ! what would you be doing if you were n't a footballer ? i 've always seen myself as a footballer			0
maybe i 'd be in the @entity91 , it 's just peaceful			0
