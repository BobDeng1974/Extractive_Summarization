@entity0 might feel like his judgment has been criticised at every turn in recent weeks , but no - one has dared to doubt the value of his swoop to beat @entity6 to the signing of @entity8			1
with 14 goals in 24 games since his £ 30million move from @entity12 , @entity8 has often seemed like the only thing separating @entity15 ’s depleted side from the mid-table ordinariness which has plagued @entity17 and @entity6 since the exit of @entity19			1
how the teams would have coped if the @entity21 had opted for mersey - side instead of @entity23 will never be known , and @entity0 was taking no chances as he turned on the charm during the @entity26 , stressing key factors like @entity15 ’s style of play and their continuous presence in the @entity31			1
@entity0 believes @entity8 chose @entity15 for their style and consistency in @entity34 @entity0 revealed that he told the former @entity12 player the the style of football @entity15 play would suit him @entity17 had also been in the market for @entity8 in the summer but the @entity21 chose @entity15 @entity8 ( centre ) celebrates with teammates after scoring in @entity15 's 1 - 0 win over @entity43 later , he became conscious that @entity6 might steal an edge as they went deeper into the @entity19 deal with @entity12			1
‘ i thought @entity6 was a serious candidate because they had @entity19 going there , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ you could think that ’s an easy way to do the deal			2
but , at the end of the day , every great player today has a choice to go where he wants to go			2
he has chosen us and we are very happy for that			2
‘ there were other clubs in for him as well			2
transfers at that level always take time to get every detail right , so you think always that somebody else can come in , like @entity64 or @entity65 , to do the deal as well			2
’ @entity0 , who was at the @entity26 working for television , added : ‘ i met his agent in @entity69 a few times and we could talk about the transfer			1
former @entity12 star @entity8 ( left ) escapes @entity73 's @entity72 in the @entity31 semi final @entity8 starred for @entity75 in the @entity26 this summer but was knocked out by hosts @entity69 on penalties @entity17 has been under pressure after losing @entity19 to @entity12 and @entity79 to injury @entity6 did secure a place in the semi final of the @entity83 with a midweek win over @entity85 ‘ i just tried , like every manager , to convince the player that you can help him develop the quality of his game and that the way we play football would suit him			1
‘ i think that ’s why he has chosen us in the end			0
as well , we have continuity			0
all the players want to play in the @entity31			2
it ’s quite simple , and we have good continuity on that front			0
’ @entity103 claimed earlier this season that @entity8 would have been the ‘ ideal replacement ’ for @entity19 , who scored 31 goals as @entity6 finished runners - up in the @entity108 last season and cost @entity12 £ 75m			1
having missed @entity8 , @entity6 turned to @entity110 , who has yet to score a league goal since his £ 16m move from @entity113			1
after returning from injury , he will miss tomorrow ’s game as he serves a one - match ban for a racially offensive @entity118 post featuring @entity110			0
with @entity79 injured , @entity0 does not fear a repeat of his last trip to @entity121 , in february , when his team were four down after 20 minutes and lost 5 - 1			1
@entity0 compared the situation to @entity15 's attempts to lure @entity19 away from @entity6 in 2013 ‘ @entity6 scored over 100 goals last season in the @entity108 and they were very good going forward , ’ said the @entity15 boss			1
‘ this season they ’ve scored 19 , so they are not on the same trend offensively			0
they started off the blocks very strong that day and we were too late to get into the game			0
every defeat is a scar in your heart forever			0
we also have very good memories at @entity6			1
we won many games at @entity6			1
even last year , after we lost against them , a week later against the same team we won 2 - 0 at home in the @entity141			0
’ despite @entity6 ’s problems , @entity0 refused to rule them out of a top - four finish and was wary of wading into the @entity110 debate			1
‘ he is a very sensitive subject , ’ smiled the @entity15 boss			1
why ? ‘ because it is an interesting subject			0
’ another wry smile , then he added : ‘ i do n’t know him at all			0
’ @entity19 stayed and scored 33 goals for @entity6 before moving to @entity12 in the summer transfer window this hardly solved the enigma , but @entity0 was more emphatic as he tried to quash the idea that he has also considered signing @entity110 last summer			1
‘ no , you linked him with me , ’ he told reporters			0
‘ we have the type of presence up front with @entity160 and @entity161			0
we have players of that calibre			0
’ @entity8 has gone two games without a goal for the first time since september and @entity15 will try to protect him through his first experience of the packed festive schedule , even though he has adapted well to the @entity108			1
‘ it looks like he is made for the @entity171 game , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ he ’s settled very quickly , but @entity8 has a kind of game that is instinctive and tough			2
‘ last year , we were interested in @entity19 and they have similarities			2
they are @entity177 , both provocative players , who run with the ball			0
they are very determined as well			0
‘ but the history of every big club is made up of many big players that you missed			0
i wanted to play @entity184 and @entity185 together			2
maybe if @entity185 had stayed @entity184 would not have become the player he became			0
sometimes it ’s coincidence that decides your destiny			0

@entity0 says @entity8 chose @entity15 over @entity6 in the summer because of their style of play and consistency in @entity34
the @entity21 faces @entity17 ' side on *sunday* at @entity121
@entity0 compared the situation to @entity15 's attempt to buy @entity19
