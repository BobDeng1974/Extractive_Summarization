as sparring partners go , a @entity1 actress and an evolutionary biologist would not appear to be a natural fit			1
however , oscar - winner @entity5 , 39 , and controversial scientist professor @entity7 , 73 , have found themselves inadvertently at loggerheads over whether children should be allowed to read fairytales			1
miss @entity5 , who plays an evil fairy godmother in her latest film @entity13 – a spin on the classic story of @entity17 – said fairytales play an important role in how she raises her six children , using ‘ a little magic ’ to impart important moral lessons			1
@entity5 , left , says fairytales are important to teach moral lessons			1
however , professor @entity7 , right , warned they could damage children in a new interview , she said : ‘ there are morals in these stories and you want a little magic – it ’s important to have something that we ’re a little bit in awe of			1
‘ the other day , one of the kids lost a tooth and i talked about the tooth fairy			2
half of them are old enough to think : “ what are you talking about , ” yet they ’re still not sure there is n’t something			2
‘ and i ’m not lying to them			2
i say , “ i really ca n’t tell you			2
i do n’t really know			2
mothers are sworn to secrecy			2
” ‘ kids grow up fast enough these days , so let ’s allow them to have a little bit of childhood for as long as they can			1
’ @entity7 acknowledged that the appeal of fairytales lay in their magic but believes they may be causing more harm than we think			1
he also questioned whether we should let children believe in @entity62 at all do you think teaching children myths like @entity66 and fairy tales is damaging ? do you think teaching children myths like @entity66 and fairy tales is damaging ? now share your opinion the comments put her at odds with @entity7 , famous for his vocal opposition to religion , who this week branded fairytales ‘ pernicious ’ and warned they could damage children			1
talking at the @entity79 recently , the father - of - one , said : ‘ is it a good thing to go along with the fantasies of childhood , magical as they are ? or should we be fostering a spirit of scepticism ? i think it ’s rather pernicious to inculcate into a child a view of the world which includes supernaturalism – we get enough of that anyway			1
’ he faced a backlash after the appearance , even being branded a ‘ soulless bore ’ by former @entity96 mp @entity95			0
miss @entity5 plays an evil fairy godmother in her latest film @entity13 , a spin on the classic story of @entity17 professor @entity7 has since tempered his views , saying : ‘ i did not and will not condemn fairytales			1
my whole life has been given over to simulating the imagination , and in childhood years , fairy stories can do that			1
’ however , he reasserted his opinion on thursday that there is an ‘ interesting question ’ surrounding the effect a ‘ diet of supernatural magic spells ’ might have on the development on children			1
in contrast , @entity118 , who has three adopted and three biological children with partner @entity121 , 50 – @entity122 , 12 , from @entity123 , @entity124 , 10 , from @entity125 , @entity126 , 9 , from @entity127 , @entity128 , 7 and twins @entity129 and @entity131 , 5 – said she has loved fairytales all her life and that it was this fascination that drew her to the role in @entity13			1
@entity7 has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits is as bad as ' child abuse '			1
the leading atheist said he was against the ' indoctrination of religion ' and teaching it as fact			0
@entity7 ' best - selling book @entity146 argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society			1
in the earlier interview , he claimed he had been told by a woman that while being abused by a priest was a ‘ yucky ’ experience , being told as a child that a @entity158 friend who died would ‘ roast in @entity156 ’ was more distressing			0
in remarks to @entity161 - based tv network @entity160 , he said : ‘ horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was , the damage was arguably less than the long - term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up @entity167 in the first place			2
in the interview with @entity172 magazine she said : ‘ i was fascinated by [ @entity13 ] as a child			0
i thought she was the scariest and the most interesting of all the @entity175 characters			0
but i wanted to know more about her			0
who is that gorgeous , elegant creature ? so i loved the idea of playing a @entity175 villain			0
it sounded so much fun			0
‘ i was afraid of her			0
but i loved her too because she was this elegant , sexy , evil creature			0
i was drawn to her			0
‘ i got really emotional because the script is very powerful			0
‘ we tried to make this sophisticated enough that adults will read things into it that kids wo n’t			0
parents watching the movie will identify with @entity13 in a different way , which i think is fine			0
‘ little kids on set cried when they saw me			0
people would bring their children on to the set and one kid said “ @entity203 , tell that mean witch to stop talking to me ! ” ‘ we have a choice about how we take what happens to us in our life and whether or not we allow it to turn us			2
we can become consumed by hate and darkness , or we ’re able to regain our humanity somehow , or come to terms with things and learn something about ourselves			0
