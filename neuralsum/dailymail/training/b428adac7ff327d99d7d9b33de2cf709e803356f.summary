by @entity0 a huge former container ship will this week begin the unprecedented and complicated task of destroying the deadly chemical weapon stockpile handed over by @entity5 's president @entity4			2
the vessel will be accompanied by armed guards throughout the six - stage journey that take its cargo of nerve agents and mustard gas from @entity5 to @entity12 via a mafia - plagued port in southern @entity15			1
the final consignment left the @entity5 port of @entity18 for @entity19 in @entity15 last week , meaning - officially at least - @entity4 no longer has any chemical weapons in the country			2
@entity22 : the vessel will be accompanied by armed guards throughout the six - stage journey that take its cargo of nerve agents and mustard gas from @entity5 to @entity12 , via the mafia - plagued @entity26 port in southern @entity15 the ship carrying out most of the decommissioning is the @entity31 - owned @entity30 , which will be loaded up with 700 tons of the most dangerous chemicals ever taken to sea			1
the material has been transported in small amounts to @entity26 in @entity19 , southern @entity15 - a large port which is regularly used by the notorious ' @entity38 mafia to smuggle shipments of drugs and weapons into @entity42			2
the presence of the chemical weapons will be of little interest to the criminal organisation , however , as the @entity30 - onto which the @entity5 material is being loaded - is so heavily guarded			1
now that the vessel is fully loaded , it will begin making its way into undisclosed international waters where the process of destroying the worst of the chemical weapons will begin			1
according to the @entity54 , the @entity30 has two titanium - lined reactors which can work 24 hours a day , six days a week for up to three months breaking the chemicals down			0
by the end of the process , some of the most hazardous material known to mankind will be reduced to little more than 1.5million gallons of relatively harmless industrial waste			0
this material will then make be transported on @entity64 and @entity65 vessels to northern @entity42 countries - including @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity12 - where it can easily be disposed of safely			1
the ship carrying out most of the decommissioning is the @entity31 - owned @entity30 , which will be loaded with 700 tons of dangerous chemicals			1
two processing plants have been set - up on board the vessel complex : each processing plant on board the @entity30 contains a complex set of machines that allow some of most dangerous material ever taken to sea to be turned into relatively harmless industrial waste the @entity83 , which is complete with two titanium - lined reactors which can work 24 hours a day , six a week although the removal of the material means @entity5 is officially free of chemical weapons , a number of observers claims @entity4 's forces are still using chlorine gas against rebel forces			1
unsubstantiated reports from doctors and medical staff within the country suggest pro-government forces may be using crude but barrel bombs to deploy the deadly chlorine gas - which was developed as a weapon during the @entity101			0
while the @entity103 has been unable to confirm its use , one expert has little doubt @entity4 has been deploying chlorine gas			0
@entity106 , a former commander of @entity67 chemical - weapons forces and head of specialist security compnay @entity109 told @entity54 : ' in my opinion , @entity4 sees that chemical weapons have a battle - winning ability and , no matter how crude chlorine gas is , it still has the power to terrify			0
' once complete , the operation to destroy @entity4 's chemical weapon will have involved more than 30 countries - some of which are dealing with the decommissioning and disposal of the waste , while others are merely providing transportation , or allowing the @entity30 to safe passage through their waters			0
@entity67 's involvement in the operation will see material totalling 150 tons processed and incinerated at @entity132 plant in @entity133 , @entity134			0
the @entity135 insists this material will not include dangerous chemical weapons , and will instead be relatively harmless waste material .			0

chemical weapons will be transported from @entity140 to @entity141
700 tons of nerve agents and mustard gas are going to be destoryed at sea
the material has already left @entity5 on its way to international waters
@entity31 - owned ship called @entity30 has been turned into processing plant
chemicals will mainly be decommissioned in an undisclosed *location* at sea
leftover waste *products* will then be disposed of around northern @entity42
