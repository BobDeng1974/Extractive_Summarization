by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 16:25 est , 17 october 2013 @entity2 has come under fire from fashion commentators this week for ' covering up ' @entity6 's curves on its november cover			2
the @entity9 actress , who is one of six stars to front the glossy title for its celebration of women in @entity14 , is seen in a coat and dress by plus - size label @entity17 in the almost full - length photo , which cuts off mid-calf			1
but for critics , the cover was received with disbelief and disappointment			0
under fire : @entity2 has been accused of ' covering up ' the curves of bridesmaids star @entity6 on its november cover the writers of fashion blog @entity28 were among the most vocal			2
they wrote : ' i kind of ca n't believe they put the plus - size actress on their cover buried inside a giant coat			1
' and former model @entity34 told @entity35 that ' times have changed			0
i just immediately thought , " what a missed opportunity to represent all the curvy girls of the world			0
' @entity42 writer june @entity41 called @entity6 the magazine 's ' token plus - size cover girl ' and noted that the only visible flesh is a tiny triangle between the coat ’s lapels and the briefest glimpse of calf			1
' she mused that ' perhaps photographer @entity53 only knows how to photograph the usual stick insect models , because he clearly has no clue how to highlight @entity6 ’s curves			0
' ' on all our shoots , stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in , and this is no different : @entity6 loved this look ' and @entity64 argued that ' it ’s hard to see this as a victory [ for plus - size women ]			1
' celebrity psychotherapist @entity69 told @entity70 that the styling is ' sending the psychological message that hiding is what full - figured women should do			1
@entity6 is beautiful , talented and popular – her beauty should be flaunted not covered			0
this shows that the fashion world is trying to strike the balance between featuring full - figured women , while still hiding them as well			1
' @entity2 defended its cover stating that they are careful to choose looks that the subjects feel good in , and that @entity6 was delighted with the outcome			0
winter fashion : the @entity9 actress , who is one of six stars to be celebrated by the glossy title for its women in @entity14 issue , is seen in a coat and dress by plus - size label @entity17 in a statement issued to @entity97 , a spokesperson said : ' on all of our shoots , our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in , and this is no different : @entity6 loved this look , and is gorgeous on our cover			1
we are thrilled to honor her as one of our women in @entity14 this year			1
' and indeed they have plenty of support in their positive opinion of the cover			0
after all , the magazine did not shy away from featuring her body entirely , as it did when it featured @entity116 last year , or as @entity117 did with its @entity119 cover			0
as a plus - size brand , it is rare to see @entity17 featured on a mainstream fashion magazine cover at all			1
and a coat is an appropriate choice of attire for a winter issue , just as new season stock is hitting stores			2
@entity14 hit : ms @entity6 pictured in the 2011 comedy bridesmaids , in which she co-starred with @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 critics have also failed to question whether it was partly ms @entity6 's choice to be dressed in a coat			2
perhaps , at 43 , she is not comfortable in a clingy dress			2
this question , of course , can only be answered by ms @entity6 herself , who has not yet responded to @entity97 's request for comment , but the shoot won effusive praise from @entity147 blogger @entity146			0
' we wanted to see her fashion forward , playful , and celebratory of her shape - well hello ! talk about giving it her all , ' she wrote			2
' i can not tell you how hyped of this cover i am ! @entity155 for @entity2 delivering to us a shoot and fashion cover that we can be quite proud of ! ' @entity159 , too , had nothing but praise , calling ms @entity6 ' absolutely gorgeous and glamorous ' and taking issue with the critique			0
what 's more , plus - size stars ' covers sell			1
@entity117 said its @entity119 cover in 2011 was one of its best selling that year , and according to a poll on @entity28 , ms @entity6 's cover was the most popular of the six released by @entity2 for its november 2013 issue .			0

the @entity9 star is one of six stars to front the glossy title for its celebration of women in @entity14
the actress , 43 , is seen in a coat and dress by plus - size label @entity17 in the almost full - length photo , which cuts off mid-calf
