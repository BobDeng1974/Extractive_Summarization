@entity1 will force left - wing policies on @entity4 @entity3 if the @entity5 hold the balance of power after the next election , he boasted today			1
the former first minister , who is standing for @entity9 in may , said he would work with other parties except the @entity11 to ' see more progressive politics introduced across these islands '			1
mr @entity1 also refused to rule out becoming deputy prime minister in a @entity15 – but said it was more likely that his party would prop up @entity18 in return for more powers for @entity21 , a hike in the minimum wage and scrapping @entity25 's nuclear deterrent			1
the shadow foreign secretary was repeatedly pressed on whether @entity15 would do a deal with @entity36 's party but said he was ' not going to play that game '			1
but mr @entity30 insisted @entity15 would not be held to ransom over the renewal of @entity40 – the nuclear weapons system which needs replacing			1
he said : ' as a prospective foreign secretary in an incoming @entity15 government the responsibility of defending this country is not something that is the subject of simply trading away interests one way or another			2
' ' our position on @entity40 is very clear and i 'm not changing it , ' he added			0
mr @entity1 told @entity55 's @entity54 programme the @entity5 would ' progress the @entity21 interest ' in any negotiations			1
the @entity11 put out an election poster last week claiming @entity18 could be propped up in @entity59 by the @entity5 and @entity60 with @entity15 looking increasingly unlikely to win enough seats to form a majority after the election , both the @entity63 and the @entity5 could hold the balance of power			1
business secretary @entity66 today insisted he could happily work with @entity15 in the national interest			1
he said : ' i ’ve worked with a team of @entity4 ministers , we do n’t agree on a lot of things , but we work as a business - like team and i would a adopt the same approach to the @entity76			2
' there are things in policy terms we do agree about and support for the industrial strategy is a good example , taxation of higher value properties is another			0
' i think we have a more flexible approach to borrowing for good investment than the @entity11 do			2
' we ’ve always taken the view we are happy to work with other parties in the national interest			2
' he said that would mean , ' in particular ' winning more powers for @entity9			2
he said the @entity5 would have to ' enforce the delivery of the vow , the promise that was made to @entity21 of home rule , neo-federalism , devo - to - the - max in these last desperate days of the referendum campaign '			1
but he added : ' there 's also an area where the @entity5 , in conjunction with allies in @entity103 in @entity104 and the @entity105 in @entity3 will want to see more progressive politics introduced across these islands			1
' for example , instead of another bout of austerity from @entity15 or conservatives , the cancellation of the renewal of the @entity40 missile system , and diverting that funding , £ 30bn over the next ten years , into health and education and to something useful and productive			2
' and i think that will have a lot of support in @entity3 as well as in @entity21			0
' asked whether he would support @entity18 , perhaps by serving as deputy prime minister , mr @entity1 said a formal coalition was ' unlikely '			1
he said : ' @entity36 's laid this out very clearly			0
what we 've ruled out is any deal with the conservative party , formal or informal			0
' i think @entity36 said that a formal coalition is unlikely			0
we 're not ruling it out			0
but it would be unlikely			0
' the best way to affect change is to negotiate on a vote - by - vote basis			0
and the things we 're negotiating is delivery of the vow to @entity21 , the cancellation of the renewal of the @entity40 system , and support for progressive politics , for progressive causes , things like the living wage across these islands			1
' mr @entity1 predicted another hung @entity9 after the election – with no party holding enough seats to form a majority			1
he said : ' nothing 's certain in life or politics			2
but a balanced parliament looks pretty likely at the present moment			0
' that looks like the most likely outcome			0
i 'm hardly surprised because who 'd want to give either @entity160 or @entity18 a majority ? ' i do n't think either of them is worth it			0
so a balanced parliament looks like the favourite at the present moment but nothing is certain			0
' mr @entity30 conceded the ' polls are tough ' for @entity15 but insisted the party was fighting for a majority			1
he told @entity171 's the @entity170 : ' the polls are tough , but the fact is after the referendum there were a very significant constituency in @entity21 who want change			0
i share that appetite for change			0
' in the coming election in may the way that we can secure that change is not to split the centre left vote but to deliver the maximum number of @entity189 and , thereby , make sure we have a progressive government not a government led by @entity160 or a government of @entity160 and @entity194			2
