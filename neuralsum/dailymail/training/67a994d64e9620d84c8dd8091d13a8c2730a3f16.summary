@entity0 , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology , believes ' menstrual leave ' would boost women 's motivation and productivity when they are in the workplace women who suffer from period pains and feel under the weather each month should get paid leave , a leading doctor has suggested			1
@entity0 , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology , believes ' menstrual leave ' would boost women 's motivation and productivity when they are in the workplace			1
he even goes as far as to question if a woman were to accidentally become pregnant , should her employer pay for the termination - although concedes that ' society is unlikely to be ready for that '			2
mr @entity0 , formerly of @entity23 in @entity24 - and who now practices in @entity25 - is a leading international figure in the field of @entity28			2
explaining his reasoning , he told @entity30 : ' some women feel really grotty when menstruating			0
coming into work is a struggle and they feel lousy			0
' when you feel like that , it 's harder to take pride in your work or perform as well			0
this is about employers being sensible and aware			0
' like maternity leave , he proposes the menstrual leave should not interfere with career progression or structure			1
' it would be one to three days each month , separate to sick leave entitlement – it is not sickness , after all			1
' menstrual leave is already recognised in some countries in @entity54 , such as @entity55 and @entity56			1
the concept is believed to have started in @entity55 in the early 20th century			2
writing in the journal @entity59 , @entity60 , of the @entity61 , explains that menstruation leave first emerged as an issue in the 1920s and 1930s when employed women were mostly young , and working conditions for them were difficult			2
' the lack of adequate sanitary facilities and materials made management of menstruation especially difficult for factory and transportation workers , ' she said			0
as a result , it was bus conductors and textile workers who were among the first workers to request menstruation leave			0
in @entity55 , legislation passed in 1947 permitted leave for any woman who ' suffered heavily ' with menstruation or the work was ' injurious to her body during menstruation '			1
however it does not specify the number of days or whether the leave is to be paid			0
there was also a belief that taking leave while menstruating prevented problems during pregnancy and childbirth , such as miscarriage and premature labour			2
however the number of women taking up menstrual leave over the years declined			1
ms @entity60 said reasons for this include the average age of women workers increasing - with older women having less need for the leave - and ambitious , career - minded women becoming increasingly concerned that taking it could harm their career prospects			2

when you feel like that , it 's harder to take pride in your work or perform as well ' @entity127 's current menstrual leave legislation guarantees female workers three days of menstrual leave a year , in addition to the 30 days of half - paid sick leave allotted to all workers			1
@entity56 women are entitled to take two days a month of menstrual leave , though many companies simply ignore the law , and others have even been accused of forcing women to ' prove ' their need for time off , some reports have claimed			1
the concept is also being discussed in @entity141			1
however when the issue was debated last year in the @entity145 @entity144 , it caused uproar and was thrown out			1
women 's rights activists in the country reacted with anger to proposals by @entity151 , a member of the nationalist @entity153 party , who proposed the draft law to increase the protection of women at the workplace			1

' during that period , most women experience psychological and physiological discomfort , ' said mr @entity151 , 32 , who is married with two sons			0
' the pain for the fair sex is often so intense that it is necessary to call an ambulance			0
' but human rights campaigners dismissed mr @entity151 's idea as sexist			2
the matter reared its head recently at the @entity191 in @entity192			0
mr @entity0 , who was on the panel , said : ' we heard from one man in the audience that women in a particular work - place in @entity56 were all absent on the same days			1
' was this menstrual synchrony - where the women experience their menstrual cycle at the same time ? ' no one knows , but the wife of the employer stumbled upon these ladies shopping together in the local mall			2
' he devised a plan where women were offered a bonus payment if they worked while menstruating - effectively a menstrual bonus			2
' this resulted in full attendance in this workplace - i think it 's brilliant - this boss is a smart cookie			0
' mr @entity0 told @entity30 : ' the issue goes back 100 years when sanitary and hygiene facilities were different , when opportunities for women to look after themselves while menstruating were simply not there			1
' today , the issue is about enlightenment - that is what interests me			0
' menstrual leave will make people feel more happy and comfortable in the workplace , which is a positive thing			1
' he cites further examples of ' enlightenment ' as @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235 proposing egg freezing for female employees who are worried about their biological clocks			0
he also praises recent egg freezing initiatives proposed by @entity235 and @entity233 for female staff the idea of menstrual leave matter reared its head recently at the @entity191 in @entity192			1

' ' these employers are being sensible and looking after the wishes of modern women in the workplace , ' he said			0
' and what many people forget is - women make up half the workforce			0
if they feel supported , they will be a happy and productive workforce			0
maternity leave is just part of the deal			0
' so how would menstrual leave work , exactly ? would a woman have to prove she was menstruating ? ' i do n't think women should be shy about it , ' said mr @entity0			1
' there should be no proof needed - employers should take it on good faith			0
' he added : ' it 's not a case of policing , it 's about taking it on face value			0
over time , records will show is there is a pattern of cycles , and so on			0
' and what of the critics who argue some women would abuse the system ? ' i see it as an indication of how employers can be sensible to women in the workplace – and keep them there , ' he told @entity30			0
' i am not suggesting the @entity314 advocates it - but we could work out how to do it			0
' if you want to keep everyone happy in the workplace , do n't do @entity322 stuff , like @entity323 in the toilets , just be fair and respect people and use your judgement			0
' and what about men , who will question why women should get up to 36 days of paid leave a year ? ' because , ' he said			2
' do you want a cup of tea when you get home in the evening ? ' do you want your wife to be in pain ? ' ' it 's not men who have to get pregnant , go through ivf and childbirth			1
' men will just have to understand			2
' he also praises recent egg freezing initiatives proposed by @entity235 and @entity233 for female staff			0
he said : ' @entity235 and @entity233 have done nothing more than acknowledge that women can and should manage their reproductive health and well being as they see fit , whether it is the contraceptive pill , having a termination of pregnancy for social reasons or exploiting ivf technology			2
' @entity233 should be applauded for its initiative			0
' will we soon hear about employers offering to pay for termination of pregnancy if unwittingly conceived in the workplace ? ' or is this a step too far for the nerds of @entity360 ? ' he added that all the changes in women 's fertility and reproduction that came in the second half of the 20th century brought about considerable change and also caused a great deal of comment			1
' the launch of the contraceptive pill in 1961 has been described as the most significant medical advance of the 20th century and it was followed by the @entity373 of 1967 , ' he said			0
' these changes were all hotly debated at the time of their introduction but they have made an enormous change to women 's ability to follow a career			1

@entity0 , professor of obstetrics and gynaecology , believes ' menstrual leave ' would boost women 's motivation and productivity
the leave would also be separate to a woman 's sickness entitlement
says of men who will complain of the idea : ' it 's not men who have to get pregnant , go through ivf and childbirth . men will just have to understand '
menstrual leave is already a legal in countries such as @entity55 and @entity56
