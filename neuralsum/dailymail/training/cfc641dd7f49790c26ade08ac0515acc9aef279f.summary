@entity0 was so thrilled with reaching the @entity2 semi-finals after saving two match points that his voice was quivering with the effects of adrenaline and emotion			1
‘ it ’s just unbelievable , ’ he told his courtside interviewer with the enthusiasm of a teenager after delivering another late night classic on @entity12 that saw him squeeze through against @entity14			1
except @entity0 , who plays @entity17 ’s @entity16 for a place in the final , is no teenager			1
he is the 33 - year - old father of four children ( two sets of twins ) , but if that has shaved anything from his desire and competitive spirit it is becoming harder than ever to discern			0
victory : @entity0 beat @entity14 4 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 in their @entity2 quarter - final it certainly was for the mercurial @entity14 , who if he had the same natural appetite for success as the @entity34 master would surely have achieved more in a career that has never quite delivered on its early promise			1
he has not had a coach for 18 months , swigs @entity38 during the changeovers and seems to make everything up as he goes along with glorious spontaneity			0
the contrast could not be greater to @entity0 , who at this stage of his life knows he has to plan everything with the precision that his country ’s watches are known for — not just his training but his family logistics as well			2
that is why he will be favoured to reach a second consecutive @entity53 final of the season , where he would meet either @entity56 ’s @entity55 or still the tournament ’s most likely winner , @entity57			2
it is also why he has the resolve to hold off the pair of match points which came at 4 - 5 in the fourth set in the course of a 4 - 6 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 2 victory over @entity14			1
impressive : despite having no coach , and drinking coke during the match , @entity14 was impressive ‘ you know , being down match point , it ’s just not fun , ’ he explained			1
‘ because you ’re so close to leaving the court with your head hanging down and going to have to do press which is so annoying after you ’ve lost			0
‘ it ’s hard to block it out , but you snap back in because you do n’t have much time			0
you ’re like “ okay , let me try and hit a good serve			0
let ’s hope it works ”			0
’ @entity0 hardly needs the cash or the titles			1
he has 17 @entity53 to his name and his nearest pursuer , @entity86 , is currently out with wrist problems			1
his fortune is estimated to be at least £ 150million			0
stretch : @entity0 knows how important preparation is for him now that he is 33 the key to his longevity is the pure and enduring love of the game , the lifestyle , the competition and doubtless the fame			2
to help sustain him he has hired his childhood idol @entity98 to work with him , and the coaching situations of all four men ’s semi-finalists provide a fascinating sub-plot as the event reaches its climax			0
the four coaches — @entity98 , @entity106 ( @entity55 ) , @entity107 ( @entity57 ) and @entity108 ( @entity16 ) — read like the semi-final line - up for some @entity111 event from the early nineties			1
all are former @entity53 champions , and their appointments followed @entity116 employing @entity117			2
champion : @entity0 has 17 @entity53 to his name and has earned an estimated £ 150million tennis players are always trying to find an edge and when they see something working for one of their rivals they tend to follow suit			1
who knows , maybe in a few years many of the top names will be coached by women			0
in @entity0 ’s case @entity98 was hired more as a part - time mentor at first , although it has developed into something resembling full - blown coaching			2
the @entity134 used to hate coming to @entity135 as a player , yet he has spent the time here overseeing his charge ’s run into the last four			0
@entity107 ’s first six months on the job were not considered a success , yet now he is poised to help deliver a second @entity143 alongside the @entity144 .			0

@entity0 came from match point down to beat @entity14
next up for @entity0 is a @entity2 semi-final against @entity16
@entity0 has won 17 @entity53 titles
