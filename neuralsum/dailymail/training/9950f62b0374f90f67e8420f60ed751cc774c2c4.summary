by @entity1 reporter published : 11:29 est , 14 october 2012 updated : 22:39 est , 14 october 2012 one of the most prominent characters on the campaign trial in the wake of the first presidential debate was @entity6 , the @entity7 puppet beloved by millions but targeted by @entity9 nominee @entity8			0
after the former @entity13 governor took aim at @entity15 - and , as a result , @entity6 - during the debate , it was one of president @entity19 's top advisers who turned that comment into a major talking point			1
a profile in the @entity23 details how @entity24 , one of the president 's deputy campaign managers , turned the television puppet into a manifestation of @entity8 's vision			1
two days after the debate , ms @entity24 posted a photo to @entity46 of a person dressed as @entity6 at a @entity8 rally , with the caption ' looks like somebody showed up in ( @entity51 ) to ruffle @ mittromney 's feathers '			2
making the point even more clear , she included the hashtag # protectsesamestreetnotwallstreet			0
from there , the @entity6 argument picked up steam and the campaign went on to create a 30 - second advertisement that jokingly compared notorious banking scammers like @entity62 to the @entity7 character who was described as ' big , yellow , a menace to our economy '			0
picking a fight : two days after the debate , @entity24 used her @entity46 feed to stoke the fire big bird : she tweeted this photo ( left ) and then the campaign created a similar television ad ( right ) though ms @entity24 , 43 , was not directly involved in the creation of the ad , the premise that she established in her original @entity46 was very clearly the inspiration behind it			1
ms @entity24 has long been a prominent operative for @entity82 candidates , but she has begun to step in front of the camera more frequently during this election as a result of the prominent role she holds and the degree to which she has made herself an integral part of the @entity19 administration			1
a close confidante to the late senator @entity94 , ms @entity24 first became involved with the @entity95 when she helped arrange for former first daughter @entity97 's endorsement of the then - senator from @entity99			2
when it came time for @entity19 to take the realm , she had already gone through her own battles within the party as she was given much of the blame for @entity106 's failed presidential bid in 2004 , even though mr @entity106 defended her in saying that it was not her fault			0
with the boss : @entity24 ( left ) is seen here in a @entity112 meeting with the president and then - chief of staff @entity114 in july 2011 predecessor : she worked closely with @entity106 when he ran for president in 2004 against @entity118 the @entity23 explains that following that fall from grace , she took what many viewed as a demotion by working with politicians seemingly in crisis mode : treasury secretary @entity124 after the @entity126 bailout , and first lady @entity19 after she made the gaffe in saying that her husband 's nomination was the first time she was proud of her country			1
friends say that it is ms @entity24 's exacting nature that has helped her handle even the most tricky of trouble spots , justifying why she was given the delicate assignment of telling then - @entity140 nominee @entity139 to tone down her earring selections in order to pass through her confirmation hearings			0
' she has an attention to detail that builds huge confidence on the part of the people she works for and , i say this parenthetically , especially women , ' @entity144 , former @entity19 @entity145 communications director told @entity153 .			0

@entity24 is a deputy campaign manager for president @entity19
