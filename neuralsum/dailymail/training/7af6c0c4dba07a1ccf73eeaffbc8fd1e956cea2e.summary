by @entity0 for @entity1 a bus company in @entity3 has confused commuters after attaching a timetable to a lamppost down the road from where passengers can actually get on to the bus			1
bus company @entity10 said they were forced to put the sign up on a pole 400 yards from the bus stop because it was the closest post they could attach it to			1
the rogue timetable has lead to some residents in @entity17 , @entity3 , waiting for buses in the wrong spot , with one local claiming a man was clipped by a car while trying to walk to the lamppost			1
passengers in @entity3 have been left confused after a bus company attached a timetable to the lamppost despite the nearest stop being 400 yards up the road the company says it was unable to attach the timetable closer to the actual bus stop ( pictured ) because there was no nearby lamppost to attach it to locals say passengers have been left waiting for the bus in the wrong spot after the timetable was attached to a post 400 yards away from the actual bus stop local resident @entity34 said : ' it is a death trap to walk there			1
some of the buses have refused to stop there because that road is just so bad			0
' he added that some buses have even started stopping next to the timetable , further adding to the confusion			0
@entity44 of @entity45 said : ' the bus stop at @entity47 has not been relocated and is still sited in the same place			0
residents say one man was clipped by a car while trying to walk to this lamppost , and worry that someone might get run over while waiting in the wrong place ' the confusion has been caused because one of the bus companies has added a timetable case to a pole situated further up the road as there is no pole close to the bus stop			2
' this has led to some people wrongly regarding this pole as the bus stop			0
' we are working with the bus company to address the situation but , in the meantime , would advise passengers to continue to use the genuine bus stop			2

timetable attached to lamppost in @entity17 , @entity3 , by bus company
however passengers can only board the bus 400 yards up the road
company say there were no poles closer to the stop to attach sign to
