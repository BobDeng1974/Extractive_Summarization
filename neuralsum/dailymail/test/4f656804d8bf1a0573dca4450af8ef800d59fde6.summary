@entity1 football made a killing in the stock market this week			1
yet its rise was not because @entity6 won their first @entity8 title since 2008 , ending @entity10 's four - year reign			1
it was down to @entity12 , who scored his 20th goal of the season to confirm their 22nd championship in @entity17			1
it turned heads at @entity20			2
yet @entity21 , their chief scout , had been doing his homework long before @entity24 reached the total which @entity26 holds in such high regard			1
@entity6 's @entity12 celebrates with the trophy after securing the @entity8 championship @entity24 ( left ) and @entity6 team - mate @entity30 ( right ) celebrate with the @entity8 trophy @entity6 manager @entity32 ( left ) and top goalscorer @entity24 ( right ) clinched the title with three games to spare 20 – @entity12 ( winger ) 19 – @entity37 ( striker ) 16 – @entity39 ( striker ) 14 – @entity41 ( striker ) 14 – @entity43 ( striker ) the manager announced in february he lacked a striker who could score 20 goals			1
if a 21 - year - old can do it from the wing in 27 appearances , albeit in @entity17 rather than @entity52 , is that not worth a £ 25million investment ? @entity20 think so , and they are not alone			1
from ' official talks ' with @entity56 , to ' discussions ' with @entity58 , to a not - so - secret meeting in @entity60			1
@entity24 has been busy , and no wonder			2
he is the @entity8 's top goalscorer , without even being @entity6 's main forward			1
his 20 goals have contributed 12 points , which just so happens to be the difference between them and second - placed @entity10			2
yet not many people had heard of @entity24 , particularly before the @entity69 , so why the sudden case of rubbing hands together ? how @entity24 could look for @entity20 should he make his £ 25m move to @entity74 this summer depay pictured in action during @entity6 's title - winning victory against @entity78 last weekend at home @entity24 is the @entity8 's top goalscorer with 20 , without even being @entity6 's main forward in their attack @entity24 was understood to have held a meeting in @entity60 as he nears his £ 25m move with @entity26 @entity86 , his background			1
he has ' dream chaser ' tattooed across his chest , and ' successful ' inked on the inside of his lower lip			0
joining the iconic @entity20 brand would not contradict either , particularly given his difficult childhood			2
as a four - year - old , his parents separated			1
in 2012 , after turning 18 , he dropped ' @entity24 ' from the back of his shirt as a snub to his absent father			2
raised by his mother in the southern @entity1 town of @entity102 , he grew up in ' a small village where there is not much to do ' , so says @entity105 , a childhood friend of @entity24 's			1
yet some of the greatest footballers were created in such places			0
take @entity110 's @entity109 , for example			0
he grew up in poverty - stricken rural @entity112 in a mining town called @entity114 – literal meaning @entity116			0
with @entity24 poised to join the @entity118 , talk is of him being paid the same as @entity109 – £ 130,000 a week			2
yet the man handed his @entity17 debut just 18 months ago by @entity122 remains relatively unknown			1
the manager sees something in him			0
as a player , @entity24 can be used as a makeshift forward , and has been likened to @entity127 by @entity6 manager @entity32 and @entity10 great @entity128			1
he 's fast - paced , tricky , and physical			0
a left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot – not unlike his counterpart and compatriot @entity131			1
his specialty is free - kicks			0
five of his 20 goals were from dead - ball situations – his latest against @entity78 seven days ago , when @entity6 were crowned champions with three games to spare			1
his talents are n't new to those in @entity17 , however			0
nobody in @entity8 completed more dribbles ( 101 ) last season , and he created the second-most chances ( 87 ) , too			1
@entity24 has ' dream chaser ' tattooed across his chest , and ' successful ' inked on the inside of his lower lip @entity24 celebrates with his @entity17 team - mate @entity131 during the @entity69 in @entity152 @entity153 , a right - footed left - winger , celebrates with his counterpart @entity131 , a left - footed right - winger it is exactly what @entity20 need , given they have created fewer chances ( 332 ) than @entity160 ( 342 ) and @entity161 ( 352 ) this season			1
it led to his potential being recognised by @entity166 's heavyweights during the summer			0
called up , the then - 20 - year - old 's goal against @entity169 made him the youngest @entity1 scorer in the history of the @entity69 , taking over from @entity172 at @entity173 ' 98			1
that was @entity24 's first goal in @entity152 , before his second against @entity112 – the same total @entity52 's squad managed as a collective in @entity179 when @entity17 used a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , he got the nod to join @entity131 and @entity182 in a three - pronged attack			1
he had four shots , with 100 per cent accuracy , and scored two of them			0
already a disciple of @entity26 's philosophy , it seems			2
compare @entity24 to @entity20 's other forwards – @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 – and he blitzes the averages of the rest			1
he scores a goal every 115.2 minutes ( with @entity193 nearest on 119.3 )			0
he creates a chance every 41.9 minutes ( with @entity192 nearest on 62.5 )			0
he makes a run every 14.9 minutes ( with @entity192 , again , nearest on 37.1 )			0
how @entity24 could look for @entity20 ( left ) and the winger playing last week for @entity6 ( right ) @entity74 forwards @entity192 ( from left to right ) , @entity182 , @entity194 and @entity195 and yet , he is not the complete package			1
he has been labelled greedy by some , averaging a shot every 19.9 minutes , having had 277 in 79 appearances in @entity8 in the last three seasons			0
even @entity207 , the supposed ball - hog at @entity209 , averages fewer ( 24.3 minutes per shot )			0
as is understandable with young players , his decision - making leaves a lot to be desired , too			0
he needs teaching , perhaps by his former national manager in @entity60			0
@entity24 would n't be the first to leave @entity6 for the @entity118 , or even @entity74 for that matter , after all			2
thursday marked 14 years since sir @entity218 signed @entity219 from @entity6 for a then - @entity221 transfer record of £ 19m			2
the striker went on to make 150 appearances , scoring 95 goals , averaging one every 128.2 minutes			0
@entity24 would n't be the first to leave @entity6 for the @entity118 , or @entity20 for that matter @entity219 ( left ) joined @entity20 from @entity6 , while @entity227 ( right ) joined @entity228 three years after one @entity6 great arrived , another followed			1
yet @entity227 had little impact in the @entity118 with @entity228			0
he made just 25 appearances , scoring four goals with no assists , averaging one every 184.5 minutes			0
@entity24 could do worse than join the project at @entity20			2
the @entity118 can be as unforgiving as it is rewarding when it comes to potential - laden youngsters			0
they more often than not get found out , as £ 20m @entity152 @entity240 was			0
yet @entity24 can strive for great things , if his statistics are anything to go by , and putting it on the pitch at @entity74 could be the next challenge for the ' dream chaser '			0
@entity24 could soon be joining the @entity118 as he looks set to sign for @entity20 for £ 25m			2

@entity12 held a secret meeting @entity20 recently
the @entity17 winger scored last week as @entity6 clinched the @entity8 title
@entity24 is @entity8 's top goalscorer with 20 - even though he is a winger
@entity26 *previously* admitted he lacks a 20 - goals - per - season striker
the 21 - year - old is a left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot
nobody in @entity8 completed more dribbles ( 101 ) last season than him
in 2014 , @entity24 became the youngest - ever @entity1 scorer at a @entity69
@entity122 put him *alongside* @entity182 and @entity131 in 4 - 3 - 3
