the @entity0 is one of the most sought - after individual prizes in the game - and this season ’s competition is delicately poised for the final run - in			2
the three main contenders - @entity9 ’s @entity8 on 19 , @entity11 ’s @entity10 on 19 and @entity13 ’s @entity12 on 17 - are all in with a chance of winning it			1
will it go down to form ? will it be rocked by injury and suspension ? will it have the fairytale conclusion that so many would love to see ? @entity22 takes a look at the runners and riders in the race for the @entity0 ... the race for the @entity0 seems to be between @entity10 ( left ) , @entity8 ( centre ) and @entity12 left foot : 5 right foot : 10 head : 4 minutes per goal : 98.26 @entity10 , @entity11 can @entity10 ’s whirlwind season continue right until the end or will it run out of air ? his hat - trick against @entity36 in @entity11 ’s last league match just goes to show how quickly the goalscorers chart can change as he leapt to catch @entity8 within the space of 90 minutes			1
ultimately , any @entity40 and most neutrals would want to see @entity10 top at the end of the campaign , regardless of which team they support , given his story			2
@entity10 ’s main downfall will be his lack of experience			0
hopefully his youthful exuberance will not fade into nervous tension			0
@entity8 , 26 , and @entity12 , 26 , are seasoned experts compared to the 21 - year - old , more aware of what is required to find the back of the net after a long campaign when the thighs ache and the quads burn			2
@entity11 's @entity10 was 500/1 to be the @entity0 's top goalscorer at the start of the season @entity64 ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) @entity66 ( @entity67 ) 1 @entity68 ( a ) 1 @entity69 ( a ) @entity13 ( @entity67 ) @entity70 ( a ) @entity71 ( a ) 1 @entity72 ( a ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/8 ( four goals total ) this zonal map shows where @entity10 scored his 19 goals this season for @entity11 in the @entity0 this pitch view map shows where @entity10 scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for @entity11 left foot : 5 right foot : 11 head : 3 minutes per goal : 102.42 @entity8 , @entity9 the snarling , street - fighting @entity9 striker is joint - top of the goalscorers chart , but has played fewer games to reach his total goals tally and has one more to play than his two main rivals			1
@entity96 and @entity12 , however , @entity8 ’s main adversary is himself			2
his aggressive style of play means he is the most likely of the three to pick up a suspension			0
he is already on eight domestic yellow cards for the season and was retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on @entity104 ’s @entity105			0
@entity9 also have a tougher run - in than @entity11 and @entity13			1
they still have to face @entity107 and @entity104 at home and @entity109 away			0
having said that , @entity8 has already scored against @entity109 and @entity104 this season and is yet to face @entity68 who have had an unstable defence			2
@entity9 striker @entity8 is among the best signings of the season and has 19 goals in the @entity0 @entity70 ( @entity67 ) @entity116 ( a ) @entity107 ( @entity67 ) @entity109 ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) @entity36 ( a ) 1 @entity118 ( @entity67 ) @entity104 ( @entity67 ) 1 @entity119 ( a ) 1 @entity120 ( @entity67 ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/9 ( four goals total ) this zonal map shows where @entity8 scored his 19 goals this season for @entity9 in the @entity0 this pitch view map shows where @entity8 scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for @entity9 left foot : 4 right foot : 13 head : 0 minutes per goal : 107.53 @entity12 , @entity13 he is the rank - outsider , but one who you would bet against at your peril			1
@entity12 is trailing the other two by two goals , but he has scored four in one game this season , against @entity11 who he will face again in @entity13 ’s remaining eight games			1
of the three strikers , @entity12 is by far the best finisher who can conjure a goal , or two , from nowhere in a game			0
he has already scored eight times against the last eight teams @entity13 have to face - the same amount as @entity8 and @entity10 ’s record put together in their last fixtures of the season			1
injury will be @entity12 ’s main concern			0
the knee injury he suffered in december cost him a month out and he has failed to consistently string together games since he moved there four years ago			0
@entity13 striker @entity12 has 17 goals and is just two behind the leading @entity0 goalscorers @entity118 ( a ) @entity107 ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) @entity167 ( @entity67 ) @entity66 ( @entity67 ) 1 @entity11 ( a ) 4 @entity116 ( @entity67 ) 2 @entity168 ( a ) @entity69 ( @entity67 ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/8 ( eight goals total ) this zonal map shows where @entity12 scored his 19 goals this season for @entity13 in the @entity0 this pitch view map shows where @entity12 scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for @entity13 my @entity181 … this is , obviously , no exact science			1
you can analyse all the statistics , numbers and records in the world and the enigma of chance will always rear its head			0
for example , @entity8 has scored more of his goals , eight , against teams currently sitting from sixth to 10th , but only plays one of those , @entity70			0
@entity10 has netted eight of his strikes against teams now in the bottom five , and has two of those , @entity66 and @entity64 , remaining			0
conversely , @entity12 has a more even spread against teams throughout the table			0
and @entity12 has a far better early - season record against @entity13 ’s last teams than the other two			2
but then @entity12 has not scored in five games , @entity8 has two in last two and @entity10 six in his last four			1
my heart says @entity10 , but my head goes with @entity8 , so i choose the @entity9 man			1
@entity213 , @entity116 ( 15 goals ) left foot : 2 right foot : 10 head : 3 @entity116 striker @entity213 is four behind the top goalscorers on 15 for the season @entity220 , @entity109 ( 13 goals ) left foot : 8 right foot : 1 head : 4 @entity109 are well represented in the top five goalscorers this season so far with @entity220 on 13 @entity224 , @entity109 ( 13 goals ) left foot : 0 right foot : 11 head : 2 @entity224 is another @entity109 star among the top @entity0 goalscorers with 13 to his name the graphics used for @entity10 , @entity8 and @entity12 's goals were provided by @entity231			1

@entity10 and @entity8 top the @entity0 goalscoring charts
the @entity11 and @entity9 striker have 19 goals apiece
@entity13 's @entity12 trails behind with 17 goals this season
@entity116 's @entity213 ( 15 ) and @entity109 's @entity224 and @entity220 ( both 13 ) bring up the rear in the race for the @entity0
