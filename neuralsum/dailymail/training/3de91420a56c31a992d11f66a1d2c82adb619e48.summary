by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 3 july 2012 updated : 07:35 est , 3 july 2012 people with parkinson ’s disease suffer a decline in their quality of life years before they are diagnosed , it is claimed			1
scientists have documented declines in physical and mental health , pain , and emotional health beginning several years before the onset of the disease			2
and the decline then continues at a rate of five to seven times faster than the average yearly decline caused by normal ageing in people without the disease , according to researchers from the @entity21			2
a study has revealed that a decline in quality of life starts years before the disease is diagnosed lead researcher dr @entity29 said : ' we observed a decline in physical function in @entity3 ’s patients relative to their healthy counterparts beginning three years prior to diagnosis in men and 7.5 years prior to diagnosis in women			1
' the decline continues at a rate that is five to seven times faster than the average yearly decline caused by normal ageing in individuals without the disease			2
' this result provides support to the notion that the pathological process leading to @entity3 may start several years before a diagnosis			1
' the study is the first to examine patterns in the quality of life of @entity3 's patients prior to diagnosis and is published in the @entity56			1
the researchers studied 51,350 male health professionals enrolled in the @entity59 ( @entity60 ) and 121,701 female registered nurses enrolled in the @entity62 ’ @entity64 ( @entity63 )			0
in both studies , participants filled out biannual questionnaires that documented the occurrence of major chronic disease by answering questions about a variety of lifestyle characteristics			0
the nurses study measured health - related quality of life in physical functioning ; role limitations due to physical problems ; role limitations due to emotional problems ; vitality ; bodily pain ; social functioning ; mental health ; and general health perceptions			0
by contrast , the @entity60 questionnaire only assessed physical functioning			0
of the 454 men and 414 women identified with @entity3 ’s , the researchers found that a decline began about three years before diagnosis for men and 7.5 years for women			1
results also showed other measures of quality of life - available only in women - declined in a similar pattern			0
the scientists point out that their study is bolstered by the available data on both @entity3 ’s patients and a healthy group used for comparison			1
dr @entity107 said : ' our hope is that , with future research , biological markers of the disease process may be recognizable in this pre-clinical phase			0

scientists observe decline in physical function in @entity3 ’s patients three years prior to diagnosis in men and 7.5 years prior to diagnosis in women
