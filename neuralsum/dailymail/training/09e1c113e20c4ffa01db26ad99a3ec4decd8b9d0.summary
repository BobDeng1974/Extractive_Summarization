internet auction site @entity0 may only face a £ 500,000 fine despite one of the biggest cyber attacks experienced by @entity6 consumers			1
the penalty , which is the limit that can be imposed by the @entity8 , would amount to just 2p for each of the 18million users in @entity6 and 0.00002 per cent of the company 's global annual turnover			1
the email , home addresses , passwords , phone numbers and birth dates of every @entity0 account holder - 233 million worldwide - are now in the hands of hackers who can pass them on to other criminals			1
a message on the @entity0 homepage yesterday urged customers to change their passwords in the wake of one of the biggest cyber attacks in history customers were urged to change their account details after the breach , but the site received another technological setback overnight because of a dramatic increase in traffic , meaning users could not change their passwords			1
online purhcases make up around one fifth of all credit card spends in the @entity6 and consumers are expected to spend £ 107billion online this year			1
the @entity42 said it was monitoring the situation and may be forced to investigate if @entity6 details are leaked , used and purchased by criminals			1
the body can hand out fines of up to £ 500,000 to bodies that breach the @entity49			0
the most they have issued is £ 325,000 , to @entity52 & @entity51 , but also handed a £ 250,000 fine to @entity53			1
@entity54 , the information commissioner , said : ' on the face of it , this is a very serious breach			1
' what we can be sure about is that if there has been a breach of the @entity6 data protection act , we ’ll act firmly			1
' this needs to be a wake - up call to all of us			0
it shows consumers the importance of having different , strong passwords for different online services			0
' it ’s a wake - up call to government that the 20 - year - old data protection laws are showing their age			1
' but most of all it ’s a wake up to businesses			0
responsible companies have got to act to keep their customer information safe , and if they do n’t , they ’ll find they ’re not just in trouble with the information commissioner , but they ’re in trouble with customers too			1
the cyber attack on @entity0 took place in february and was undetected for around two months , giving hackers access to personal information and other non-financial data			1
even though customers were asked to reset their passwords , the breach gave intruders access to other information , which is far harder to change			2
the company said it is trying to fix the problem and is sending millions of emails to customers in a bid to resolve the issue @entity99 , a cybersecurity expert from the @entity100 said the stolen data will already be available for purchase on the @entity103 and will be sold for low prices			1
he said it will have been uploaded to ' dark corners ' of the internet and customers will not be able to retrieve it			1
he told @entity109 : ' the personal details will now be on the @entity103 and you will not be able to get it back			1
' the cyber-criminal market has become so widespread that information is very cheap			2
you can now buy credit card details for pennies			1
' criminals can get someones name , address , date of birth , email and passwords for as little as £ 10			2
' there have been so many hacks now that the market has depressed for the last two years			0
' he also urged customers to use strong passwords by shying away from words in the dictionary			0
' that is one of the techniques hackers use , ' he added			0
' when setting up an account you have to ask yourself : " why do corporations need this data ? " ' for example , dates of birth are very valuable to cybercriminals , so lie			2
' @entity144 , the chief executive of @entity145 , a company specialising in cyber security , said online criminals were advertising ' teasers ' containing names , date of births and phone numbers to potential buyers , who could then purchase the rest of the data			1
advocates of traditional high street shopping have seized on the data breach as a reason to favour bricks - and - mortar shopping			2
high streets minister @entity160 said : ' the internet has revolutionised the way we shop , increasing choice and competition to the benefit of customers			2
' @entity169 centres need to adapt to survive – such as adopting “ click and collect ” services			0
' but the cyber-attack on @entity0 reminds us of the need for internet security and for consumers to be careful about their passwords			2
this is n’t a problem that people have to think about when they shop on the high street '			0
what personal details were stolen ? hackers gained access to @entity0 customers ' names , encrypted passwords , email addresses , physical addresses , phone numbers and dates of birth			1
it is unclear whether all , or any , of the details were taken but security experts are warning people to assume the worst			2
are my credit cards details safe ? the firm said that the infiltrated part of the network did not contain any financial details , so in theory , yes			2
will changing my password solve the problem ? changing passwords will stop hackers from being able to use any login details that were stolen			2
however , they could still use names , addresses and birth dates to commit identity fraud			0
it ’s a good idea to change passwords following any attack such as this			0
it ’s also important to update login details on any sites that use the same password			0
if a hacker has your password and email address they could use it to attempt to access other sites that use the same combination			0
as a rule , the same password should never be used across different sites			0
should i change my @entity233 password as well ? @entity233 , which owns @entity0 , has confirmed its accounts and customers have not been affected by this cyber attack			1
however , as a matter of course , it ’s good practice to change all related passwords across different sites , including @entity233			0
which countries are affected ? at the moment , we can assume that all @entity0 customers worldwide will be affected by this breach , until @entity0 says otherwise			0
is this hack a result of the @entity250 bug ? when @entity250 was exposed , @entity0 announced its customer ’s account were secure and had not been affected			0
this suggests the latest hack is a separate attack			0
how did hackers steal the information ? it is unclear how the hackers got hold of the information but @entity0 said it is working with forensic teams to get an answer to this question			0
why did it take so long for @entity0 to inform customers of the breach ? @entity109 has contacted @entity0 for an answer to this question			0
it is unclear what caused the delay			0
typically , following cyber attacks , a firm will investigate the breach to try and determine how many people are affected , and the severity of the attack , before issuing advice .			1

information commissioner can issue fine for breaching data protection
cyber attack could have impacted 18million @entity6 users
cybersecurity specialists say information is in ' dark corners ' of the internet
suggest criminals could purchase personal details for ' pennies '
