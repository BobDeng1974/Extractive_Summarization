what happened to supporting each other ? it ’s even worse when your [ sic ] trying to fight people that have all the power because then you are powerless			0
' all i can say is i work extremely hard and ‘ sleeping ’ is proof that sometimes i work too hard			2
i apologise for being so ambitious			0
this just shows that the fashion industry is not the most understanding or compassionate of industries			0
' that only applies to the people that sit around not really caring and never really bothering to get to know you or what it ’s really like			0
what happened to supporting each other ? '			0
