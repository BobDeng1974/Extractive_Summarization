by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 10:59 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:22 est , 23 december 2013 an artificial heart which could extend a patient ’s life by five years has been successfully implanted for the first time			1
doctors operated on a man of 75 on wednesday night and he is said to be recovering well			1
although doctors have been attempting to transplant artificial hearts into patients since the 1980s , the devices have so far only worked for a few months			0
the artificial heart weighs 2lb ¿ three times as much as a real organ ¿ and is powered by the same type of rechargeable batteries used in toys , watches and smart phones the pioneering operation , which took place at the @entity24 in @entity25 , offers hope to the 100,000 critically - ill patients in @entity28 and the @entity29 in need of a new heart			1
the device weighs 2lb ( 0.9kg ) – three times as much as a real organ – and is powered by the same type of rechargeable batteries used in toys , watches and smart phones			1
the device is mainly made from the strongest metal titanium but outer sections that come into contact with the body are composed from cow tissue , to prevent the immune system from rejecting it			2
its @entity48 manufacturers , @entity50 , hope it will enable patients to lead a normal life and possibly be well enough to return to work			2
around 750,000 @entity54 suffer from heart failure , the main reason to need a new heart , of whom half will die within a year of diagnosis			2
although doctors have been attempting to transplant artificial hearts into patients since the 1980s , they have so far only worked for a few months at a time			0
for this reason they have only been given to a handful of patients while they wait for a donor heart to become available			2
the device is mainly made from the strongest metal titanium but outer sections that come into contact with the body are composed from cow tissue , to prevent the immune system from rejecting it over the next few weeks the surgeons will give three other patients with terminal heart failure as part of a medical trial			1
if deemed a success , the device will go on sale across @entity28 in 2015 at a price of between £ 120,000 and £ 150,000			1
the manufacturer is now planning to make smaller implants to fit women and the more petite bodies of patients in @entity88 and @entity89			0
it is sewn into the arteries and veins that surrounded the old the heart and is wired to an external battery pack usually worn by the patient around their waist			1
the device then mimics the same contractions of a normal heart to pump blood around the body			1
the male patient is said to be awake and responding well following the operation at the @entity24 in @entity25 around 100,000 people in @entity28 and the @entity29 are waiting for a new heart but only about 4,000 transplants take place every year as so few organs become available			1
@entity110 , who lead 16 surgeons performing the transplant on the @entity48 dying of heart failure , said : ‘ it ’s about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication possible			2
‘ we ’ve already seen devices of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy			2
this heart will allow for more movement and less clotting			0
’ mr @entity110 , who has been developing the device for 25 years , added : ‘ he [ the patient ] has a lot of humour			1
he ’s a very good patient			0
' over the next few weeks the surgeons will give three other patients with terminal heart failure as part of a medical trial			0
if deemed a success , the device will go on sale across @entity28 in 2015 at a price of between £ 120,000 and £ 150,000 the operation took roughly three hours to complete and surgeons said it had gone smoothly , without complications			1
@entity144 , another surgeon who was involved said : ‘ the patient was nearing the end of his life			0
the intervention took place in good conditions			0
‘ there were no complications linked to the innovative nature of the implant operation , ’ he said			0
‘ the patient is not walking yet , but we but we will try to get him sitting and then standing soon enough			0
the objective is for him to have a normal life			0
’ @entity160 , chief executive of the firm said : ‘ we are delighted with this first implant , although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase			0

man of 75 received the new heart on wednesday night and is recovering well
