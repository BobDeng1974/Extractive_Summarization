it 's the biggest week of the year for chocolate sales , eclipsing demand at @entity3 and even @entity4			1
and just in time for @entity5 , one of the world 's foremost food scientists - @entity9 - has explained why @entity5 eggs taste so good			1
according to mr @entity9 , it 's all down to smell of chocolate which , when presented in easter egg form , is enhanced			1
happy memories associated with @entity5 firmly anchor positive feelings towards chocolate eggs mr @entity9 told @entity18 : ' the smaller the chocolate layer is , the easier the chocolate will melt			1
' so that is the advantage of @entity22 ; they melt easily and the aromas of the chocolate come into your nose quite fast			1
' there are a number of reasons why chocolate tastes so good - and like mr @entity9 explained - the majority of them have to do with the way chocolate smells			1
' chocolate contains a lot of different aroma molecules , ' he said			1
' it has roasted molecules and fruity molecules			0
' these molecules contain a lot of complexity which makes it possible for chocolate to be paired with a lot of ingredients			2
and it 's not just the smell of chocolate that makes it so appealing			1
' there are a lot of taste components contained within chocolate , ' mr @entity9 continued			1
' we have sweetness , bitterness and sourness			0
plus we ca n't disregard the fat component			0
this melts at body temperature and provides a nice sensation and fresh mouth feel in the mouth			0
so what happens to us when we eat chocolate ? why does it make us feel so good , so content ... so happy ? the small chocolate layers in an egg means we get an intense whiff of chocolate when we first bite into it ' chocolate contains a molecule called phenylethylamine , which chocolate is loaded with , ' the scientist continued			1
this molecule is said to inspire feelings of love , which is why we feel good when eating it			0
' pairing chocolate with extra ingredients will enhance the feeling , ' mr @entity9 said			1
' for instance , by adding long pepper or black pepper it [ the molecule ] will have more effect			0
' and finally it all goes down to pleasurable memories and the way your egg is presented to you			1
' if you look at food more than half of experience lies outside of the taste			2
' you taste what you make out of it ; when you wrap it in a nice package , and it is presented to you by the people who love you , it will make the experience much better			2
' if you do n't have the time to make chocolate from scratch , you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs			1
once your chocolate is melted , it will need to be tempered			2
the cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along , just pop your chocolate into the freezer ( no longer than 30 seconds )			2
place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it			2
keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process			0
stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature			0
bittersweet / dark chocolate should reach a temperature of @entity132 ; milk chocolate should reach @entity134 ; and white or coloured chocolate should reach @entity136			0
once the first batch has melted , add more chocolate to your bowl , stirring as you go along			0
as soon as the correct temperature is reached , start building your @entity22 layers			0
spoon some chocolate into a mould ( you can get them from @entity146 , @entity147 or @entity148 ) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould			0
you can make it as thick as you like , building each layer as the previous one cools			0
once the final layer has been built , leave aside to cool and harden before decorating .			0
