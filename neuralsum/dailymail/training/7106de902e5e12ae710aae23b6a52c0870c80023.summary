by @entity0 published : 14:10 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 02:02 est , 12 june 2013 it 's normally an end of year rite of passage that departing pupils get their own back on their teachers for years of homework and detentions			2
but a group of teachers at a school in @entity11 decided to turn the tables this year and play a practical joke on year 11 students on their final day of school instead			1
pupils at the @entity17 in @entity11 thought that they were giving tips on camera to next term 's crop of new students joining the school			1
the first student 's sensible advice warning new pupils ' not to mess around ' is soon drowned out by @entity52 's @entity51 and some terrible dancing from the group of teachers			2
@entity56 , head of @entity57 , said that staff thought it was about time that they had the last laugh at the end of term			1
he said : ' the pupils thought they were answering questions about the best and worst things at @entity17			1
having a laugh : reception staff at the school pretend to play mini guitars as they take part in the video prank fun : this teacher looks as though she 's performing the @entity75 during the clip let 's dance : a pair of female teachers do their best impression of the @entity81 as one year 11 student gives his advice on how to get by at school let 's all do the conga : these teachers dance in a line as they celebrate the crop of @entity57 's impending departure ' we wanted to reverse the usual student pranks			1
they ’re a fantastic bunch with a great sense of humour			0
' we did n’t think it would look that good at the end of it			0
' some of the comments have not been complimentary about our dancing , but then what do you expect teachers to dance like			0
' we were making it up on the spot			0
' one of the students who took part admitted that he was completely fooled by the prank until it was played back to the students			1
fooling around : these teachers dance in the school canteen as one oblivious pupil is filmed oblivious : students at @entity17 had no idea that their teachers were playing a prank on them @entity120 said : ' a few of us had stayed up the night before , trying to decide what advice to give			1
' we did n’t know what was going on behind us at first			0
then the camera man started laughing , but i did n’t have a clue			0
' we saw it for the first time in assembly			1
our head of year and staff were laughing			0
' i give them a lot of respect			0
i did n’t think the teachers had that sort of sense of humour , i did n’t know they had it in them			0
