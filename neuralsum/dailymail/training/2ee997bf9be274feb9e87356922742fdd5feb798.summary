spokesperson for @entity32 said : ' the @entity16 angel signifies everything wholesome and dignified about @entity16 – it is as equally important to the nativity as the star and deserves to be celebrated as such			1
debenhams believe that the angel symbolises the true meaning of @entity16 ' the angel signifies the true meaning of the festive period and is a way of reminding us as to what @entity16 is really about			2
in this respect the tree topper is more important than the presents underneath			1

' the angel has been a topper for @entity16 trees since the early 18th century , in @entity60 , when trees were first brought into the home and decorated			2
debenhams sell both tree toppers , the angel is £ 10 while the star is £ 8 , but they have upped their buy of angels in a hope to return them to the top of the tree the star is a much more recent addition , not being used until in the early 19th century			1
the christmas tree did n’t reach @entity74 until later in the 19th century and both stars and angels were used			2
the fairy has only crept to the top of the tree in the last 30 years			0
@entity32 added : ' we have upped our buy of angels this year as a hope to end the star ’s monopoly over christmas tree toppers and make the angel as celebrated as it once was			1
' the angel symbolises the first ever @entity16 - in particular @entity52 , the archangel of revelation , who informed @entity91 that she would be the mother of @entity92			0
also , an angel visited @entity94 in a dream to tell him that he would serve as @entity92 ' father on @entity97 , and a number of angels appeared in the sky over @entity101 to announce and celebrate @entity92 ' birth			0
a tree was first decorated for @entity16 in @entity104 in 1510 which soon became a popular tradition			0

if not an angel , a star was used to represent the bright star that appeared in the sky to guide people to @entity92 ' birthplace			2
also , in @entity125 's translation of the @entity126 it states : ' lo , the star went before them , till it came and stood over where @entity92 was lying			0
