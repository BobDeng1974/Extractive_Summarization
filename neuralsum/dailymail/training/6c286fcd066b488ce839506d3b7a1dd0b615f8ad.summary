millions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money have been wasted by giving loans to bogus students from the @entity5 , mps warn today			1
some £ 3.84million was handed out over the last four years to @entity5 students at private higher education colleges who could not prove they were eligible for funding			1
only those who have lived in the @entity11 for three years can receive loans to cover living costs			1
if they have not been resident in the @entity11 for the previous years but are @entity5 citizens , they are only eligible for loans to cover their tuition fees			1
loans : £ 3.84million was handed out over the last four years to @entity5 students at private higher education colleges who could not prove they were eligible for funding , a cross-party report by @entity0 has found and the total amount wasted is likely to be much higher , as the @entity0 said the government was ‘ unable to quantify ’ how much money was given to students who then failed to attend or complete courses			1
some 20 per cent of students receiving funding were not even registered for a qualification , according to the @entity31 ’s report , published today			1
the number of privately funded colleges , or ‘ alternative providers ’ , has grown rapidly , with 53,000 students claiming financial support in 2013/2014 compared with 7,000 in 2010/2011			1
the total public money paid to these students has increased from £ 50 million to £ 675 million in that period			1
@entity31 chairman @entity39 criticised the ' lax ' approach the committee said the @entity42 drove this expansion ‘ without sufficient regulation ’ to protect public money			1
@entity31 chairman @entity39 criticised the department ’s ‘ lax approach ’ and said it was warned about the risks ‘ but chose to disregard them ’			0
she said : ' @entity52 pressed ahead with the expansion of the alternative provider sector without sufficient regulation in place to protect public money			0
' @entity52 was explicitly warned by the @entity57 ( @entity58 ) and the @entity59 and @entity60 about these risks but chose to disregard them both before and after implementation			0
' as a result of its lax approach , the @entity42 allowed £ 3.84 million of public money to be given to ineligible @entity5 students in the form of student loans and grants , where @entity5 students had either chosen not to or had been unable to prove that they met eligibility criteria on residency			1
' furthermore , it has been unable to quantify how much money has been lost when it has funded students who have failed to attend , or failed to complete courses , or were not proficient in the @entity76 language , or were not entered for qualifications , or where courses themselves were poorly taught			2
' she also accused ministers of failing legitimate students and colleges , and demanded an urgent review to discover the total amount wasted			2
in a report published by the committee today , the @entity0 examined financial support for students at 140 ' alternative higher education providers ' , which are privately funded but take on those who have student loans			1
it found that the rapid expansion in numbers was concentrated in five colleges , which accounted for 50 per cent of the expansion			0
around 20 per cent of students receiving funding were not registered for a qualification and drop - out rates were ' very high ' in some institutions			1
the committee said that while the expansion was aimed at widening access to @entity11 students , 40 per cent of the publicly funded students at the colleges were actually from the @entity5			1
this compared with 6 per cent in the rest of the higher education sector			0
mrs @entity39 noted : ' the @entity42 's record in collecting loan repayments from @entity5 students who have returned overseas is already poor			2
studying : legitimate students are failed by the findings , said the committee of @entity0 ( file photo ) ' there was also evidence from whistleblowers that proficiency in @entity76 language was not tested , that some institutions were recruiting students on the streets , and that students claiming funding were not attending colleges			1
' she accused ministers of failing to protect the interests of legitimate students and the reputations of those colleges that were performing well			2
she demanded an urgent review to discover the total amount wasted and said measures must be put in place to keep track of expenditure in the future			0
it comes after the @entity142 found in december that thousands of students enrolled with new private higher education colleges were not registered to take recognised exams			1
it also warned that the dropout rate among students at nine of the alternative higher education providers was in excess of 20 per cent			2
that is five times the dropout rate seen in traditional universities , with which the new colleges were designed to compete			0
the expansion of such providers followed reforms introduced by the former higher education minister @entity158			0
' shocked ' : @entity160 general secretary @entity159 yesterday , @entity160 ( @entity160 ) general secretary , @entity159 , said : ' members of the @entity31 were as shocked as we were over the government 's refusal to heed our warnings about private providers ' access to taxpayers ' money			0
the government still has serious questions to answer about why it ignored these repeated warnings and why it allowed such rapid expansion to go unchecked			0
' politicians of all stripes need to study today 's report about the sector 's failings when it comes to dealing with privatisation			0
' professor @entity182 , vice chancellor of @entity183 and chair of the @entity185 , said : ' it is important to remember that there are many alternative providers offering a first rate higher education			0
' the members of the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) have undergone stringent quality reviews in order to gain their own degree awarding powers and provide excellent student outcomes			0
' these institutions offer first rate value for money , employability and student experience			0
' they receive no direct funding from government and are careful to ensure that they are fully compliant with the expectations of the @entity42 and the @entity206			0
' poor quality should not be tolerated			0
it drains the public purse and risks tarnishing the @entity11 higher education brand			1
' a @entity42 spokesperson said : ' alternative providers play a significant role in widening access to higher education for @entity11 and foreign students , as well as boosting our exports			1
' our priority is to protect the interest of students and safeguard taxpayer 's money			2
we have made continuous improvements to the management of alternative providers since 2012			0
we recently introduced reforms to drive up quality , aimed at the small number of providers who are not currently meeting our high standards			0
' these include a fit and proper persons test for directors and a requirement to register students for the course before they can access funding			2
we are also shortly consulting on how to ensure that all students on funded courses have the right @entity76 language skills to achieve their qualifications			2

only students who have been in @entity11 3 years can claim for cost of living
but many of those granted the loans showed no proof they were eligible
a fifth were not even registered for qualification , said committee of mps
