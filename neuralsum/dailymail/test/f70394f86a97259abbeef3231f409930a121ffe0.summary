the president of the @entity1 is making a solemn promise to the hundreds of thousands of party - goers already flocking to @entity4 for saturday 's @entity5			1
' they have my guarantee we will not run out of beer this weekend , ' says @entity11			1
that is a reference to how @entity17 's trans - @entity15 army of 30,000 fans drank the @entity4 dry when he fought @entity19 eight years ago			1
with 10 times that number expected to descend on this oasis in the @entity24 desert – just so they can say ' i was there ' on the night @entity19 finally fights @entity26 – the @entity28 food and beverage department are taking no chances			1
the @entity1 is getting ready to host @entity19 's showdown with @entity26 the hotel resort on the @entity4 will host the biggest boxing contest ever on saturday night advertisements for the fight on saturday night are all over the @entity35 ahead of the contest the @entity1 expect 50,000 people each day to pass through for friday 's weigh - in and saturday 's fight 1993 - year opened 280ft - height of the four 30 - storey towers 2,500 - slot machines and video poker 7,000 - rooms and suites 9,000 - employees work at the hotel 16,000 - @entity47 capacity 100,000 - people expected for the event 170,000 - square feet of gaming a convoy of trucks is already delivering the first consignments of half a million bottles of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , who are paying more than $ 5million ( £ 3.3m ) to be one of the fight 's sponsors			1
many early arrivals are busy now stock - piling cases of their preferred foaming nectar in their rooms at the hotel , which will cost them $ 1,600 ( £ 1,057 ) a night come friday and saturday			1
even at those prices , they are the lucky ones			0
the majority of rooms on the @entity4 are reserved for proven high - rollers with track records of seven - figure gambling			2
@entity11 says : ' we are taking care of major clients from all over the world			2
' many late - comers are being reduced to renting out not only rooms in private houses but the caravans parked in those gardens			0
@entity11 expects 50,000 people to set foot in the @entity28 each day for friday 's weigh - in and saturday 's main event itself , in addition to the near 14,000 occupants of the 7,000 rooms and suites			1
merchandise for the fight on sale at the @entity1 with just days to go before the blockbuster event a hotel guest looks at a display of title belts belonging to the unbeaten @entity101 @entity19 the hotel is putting the finishing touches on it 's preparations for the biggest event in @entity4 history who do you think will win the fight between @entity19 and @entity26 ? who do you think will win the fight between @entity19 and @entity26 ? now share your opinion a hundred thousand hot dogs will be sizzling in readiness in and around the @entity114			1
all this is only the surface of the liquid lake and the tip of the food mountain which will be drunk and devoured at the @entity1 and the group 's 13 other hotel - casinos on the @entity4			1
in its comparatively new incarnation as a holiday resort destination rather than just a gambling mecca , @entity4 now generates even more revenue from such sources as accommodation , restaurants , bars and shows than it does from betting			2
@entity11 says : ' at an event like this we want to maximise all our non-gaming revenue			2
' nevertheless , the casino drop is expected to at least double the record take at the tables which has been set on @entity137 and equalled for @entity139 's biggest fights			2
projections for the economic impact on the @entity4 economy have been revised upwards from an initial $ 400m ( £ 265m ) to well over a billion dollars			2
this is the fun part of a military scale operation for putting on the mega-rich fight for which the world of boxing and beyond has been waiting for five years			0
the @entity28 has an army of 9,000 employees , almost two to every three hotel guests			1
many are engaged in security and this is where it gets serious			0
@entity19 's fight against @entity26 will take place at the @entity1 's 16,000 - capacity @entity47 fewer than a thousand tickets went on sale to the public with the rest to be distributed privately as well as being a hotel , the @entity1 is a world - famous resort with casinos and entertainment it is a complex task playing host to what will be the biggest single event in @entity4 history but ask @entity11 for his greatest concern and he says : ' the safety of all these people			1
' fights this big bring special risks			0
there will be a melting pot of thousands of @entity19 's fellow @entity101 rappers and almost as many @entity178 immigrants supporting @entity26			1
but it is not the cultural mix which worries the hosts			0
a number of fight nights at the @entity114 have ended in pushing , shoving and near - crushing among the crowds as they tried to leave			0
fortunately there have been no fatalities but after @entity19 's most recent fight here , against @entity188 , a number of injured had to be stretchered away for hospital treatment			2
after ' the last stampede , ' as @entity11 describes it , he called summit meetings to devise a new strategy for crowd control			0
a @entity196 , which on monday was being sold on the website for over $ 1,800 for the night of the fight the @entity28 resort has a golf course along with restaurants and casinos as part of it 's entertainment experience gambling is a huge source of revenue for most @entity4 hotels , including the @entity1 the two roots of the problem were the single exit route from the arena and the thousands without tickets still waiting outside , lining those hallways in hope of glimpsing the rich and famous			1
resorts here like to steer the foot traffic through the casino floors but @entity11 is putting safety first			0
although the gaming areas are required by law to be open for free entrance , movement beyond the tables to the concourses leading to the arena will be restricted to fight ticket - holders and those with restaurant or bar reservations			0
' the problem has not so much been the spectators leaving as the people - watchers blocking their movement , ' says @entity11			2
' we are now working on opening up more exit routes			0
' furthermore , this saturday , the rubber - neckers will be kept at a distance			0
they will be further discouraged by the celebrities – sports stars and @entity246 royalty among them - using a private , guarded entrance out of eyesight of the throng			0
metal detectors have been obligatory since @entity139 's infamous ear - biting fight against @entity252 spilled out into a riot on the main casino floor , with reports of gunfire and sightings of at least one cop drawing his weapon			0
@entity19 's last 10 fights have all taken place at the @entity1 , including two against @entity188 the unbeaten @entity101 beat @entity17 at the @entity1 in december 2007 @entity17 was also on the end of another devastating defeat by @entity26 at the @entity1 in may 2009 @entity11 says : ' like @entity19 and @entity26 , we need a perfect game plan			1
' more than 50,000 of the out - of - towners will be syphoned away from the arena hot - spot to watch closed - circuit tv transmission on giant screens located in all the @entity28 properties			0
even that facility for viewing the richest fight ever will cost $ 150 ( £ 99 ) a ticket			0
for the first time in ring history there will be a charge for admission to the weigh - in – at the arena on friday – to facilitate crowd control for that event			2
proceeds – at $ 10 a head – will go to charities nominated by @entity19 and @entity26			1
come saturday , @entity28 corporate security , the @entity4 police and @entity288 will make a co-ordinated effort not only to deter crime but to keep the flow of people and traffic moving through the hotel and casino and out along the @entity4			1
@entity19 beat @entity296 at the @entity1 in 2007 in a fight that set pay - per - view records those travelling by limousines and taxis will be urged to disembark and embark quickly at extra drop - off and pick - up points			1
@entity139 's fights often degenerated into crowd chaos but @entity11 expects @entity19 and @entity26 to play their part in ensuring a peaceful as well as atmospheric occasion			1
he says : ' the styles of @entity19 and @entity26 should combine to produce a fight which lives up to all the hype			2
if it 's the great fight i expect , it will help create the happy night we all want			0
' just for the record , most of we lucky 1,500 journalists out of 18,000 applicants for media accreditation are working this week in a marquee erected on a car park adjacent to the arena			0
no beer or any other alcohol allowed .			0
