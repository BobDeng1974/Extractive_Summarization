award - winning film production designer @entity13 and former model - turned television garden expert @entity14 have been brought in to transform the already luxurious 210ft cruiser into a @entity17 which will recall the splendour of the @entity19			1
majestic makeover : an artist 's impression of how the spirit of @entity24 will look when she is transformed into a @entity17 in time to lead a flotilla to mark the @entity12 next year luxurious : the 210ft spirit of @entity24 as she is today			1
the cruiser was originally built in @entity29 in the @entity30 in 2000 , but was given an overhaul after it was acquired by the @entity32 and an official artist ’s impression released yesterday reveals the extent of the makeover			2
elaborate gold gilt sculptures will be added , along with lavish red carpets , velvet drapes and two thrones beneath a canopy			2
several @entity43 - themed floral displays will be made up of flowers from the @entity46 ’s own gardens			2
pageant master @entity47 , who is organising the @entity48 , said : ‘ the @entity17 must be a jewel – the most magnificent vessel in the flotilla			1
@entity13 and @entity14 have come up with a truly inspiring design			2
’ @entity13 , who won an @entity53 for his work on the television blockbuster @entity56 , was keen to produce a vessel which recalled the glory days of the great state barges of the 17th and 18th centuries			2
but his final design will also incorporate features celebrating each of the past six decades of the @entity46 ’s reign			1
he said : ‘ we ’re trying to make every decorative element tell a story that ’s relevant to the @entity12			1
‘ aspects such as her coronation , the @entity71 countries , the 60 years of her reign , we want to reference all of these			0
honoured : former model - turned - tv garden expert @entity14 has been given the task of revamping the @entity7			0
she has chosen to bedeck the vessel with red , gold and purple flowers ‘ and as far as possible , we ’ll also make every effort to use specialist craftsmen based in @entity79			0
’ @entity80 , 50 , who now presents the @entity82 ’s @entity81 ’ @entity83 and @entity84 on @entity85 , has chosen red , gold and purple flowers and her designs will also reference the @entity71 , the coronation and the @entity91			0
she said : ‘ i feel extremely honoured to be involved in the @entity12 celebrations			1
my aim is to help make the day a truly special one for the @entity46			0
’ during the @entity4 trip , the @entity46 and prince @entity95 will be centre stage on the two thrones , which have been specially positioned under a gold - gilted canopy to ensure crowds are given the best possible view of the pair			0
palace officials are currently deciding which other senior @entity105 will be on the barge			0
what is certain is that her majesty will be accompanied by members of the @entity111 , whose ceremonial duty is to accompany the @entity113 on all her official journeys by river			0
the watermen , chosen from those whose regular business is manning tugs and launches on the @entity4 , are paid a token sum of £ 3.50 a year for their royal role			1
they will be instantly recognisable in their black caps and scarlet tunics , with the silver @entity43 cypher on both front and back			0
they will be led by the @entity46 ’s official bargemaster , a post dating back to 1215 and which is currently held by @entity131			0
@entity7 was originally constructed in @entity29 in the @entity30 in 2000 , but was rebuilt last year following its acquisition by the @entity32			1
although her day job is running @entity4 trips for paying guests , the @entity24 is far from being a bog - standard cruiser			1
in fact , according to one commentator , to describe the vessel as a pleasure cruiser is ‘ like calling the @entity142 a ferry ’			0
according to the craft ’s website , her interiors are modelled on the ‘ timeless grandeur ’ of the 1929 @entity150 railway carriage and features include 33 upholstered seats and original fixtures and fittings from ocean liners			0

her nine - hour @entity178 voyage , which includes a champagne reception , three - course lunch and a gala dinner , costs from £ 195 and £ 265 per person			0
last night , her owner @entity185 said : ‘ as the @entity7 evolved , i knew we had built something special – ideal , i thought , for the carriage of royalty			0
‘ but little did i even vaguely suspect that in the course of one short year we should be graced with such an honour			1
’ celebration : her majesty and prince @entity95 will be accompanied on the journey by members of the @entity111 , whose ceremonial duty is to accompany the @entity113 on all her official journeys by river , when she marks 60 years on the throne in june next year up until the mid- 19th century the @entity113 would regularly travel on the @entity4 either on ceremonial occasions or between the different palaces			2
as other means of transport began to prove more efficient , however , it was deemed no longer necessary to keep a @entity17			1
the @entity46 does occasionally make use of the @entity209 , a vessel made available to her by the @entity212 authority			0
it has been involved in state visits since 1971 and carries the @entity215 and @entity216 when the @entity46 is aboard			0
