two black candidates were among three people elected to the @entity2 tuesday , tripling @entity4 representation in the @entity6 suburb where poor race relations have been a focal point since the august shooting death of an 18 - year - old black by a white police officer			1
the election means that half of the six - member city council in @entity15 , a town where two - thirds of the 21,000 residents are black , will now be african - american			1
this just over one month after the @entity20 released a report on the shocking culture of racism and abuse in the city			1
the lone black incumbent councilman , @entity26 , was not up for re-election			1
the town that drew only 12.3 percent of registered voters last april had 29.4 percent turnout tuesday , according to the @entity52			1
that was about double the overall turnout in @entity6 , where @entity15 is located			1
unofficial results showed that @entity29 defeated another black candidate to win in the @entity57 ; @entity58 defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in the @entity61 ; and @entity62 , a former mayor who is white , won a 2nd @entity64 race against another white candidate			1
' this community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard , ' said councilman - elect @entity29			1
' when you have a community engaged , the sky is the limit			0
' he described it as part of a healing and rebuilding process			0
it was the first municipal election in @entity15 since officer @entity80 fatally shot @entity81 , who was black and unarmed , on aug. 9			1
the shooting sparked sometimes violent protests in the @entity6 area , and spawned a national @entity86 movement to press for change in how police deal with local minorities			0
it also prompted a review by the @entity20 , which decided not to prosecute @entity80 , who resigned in november			2
but the federal department released a scathing report blasting the city for racial bias and profiling in the police department and a profit - driven municipal court system			1
several city officials resigned following the review , including the city manager , police chief and municipal judge			1
the municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails			0
the new city council will be tasked with approving hiring of the replacements			1
the scrutiny in the wake of the shooting also found that the city had a mostly white police force and city leadership - the mayor also is white			2
@entity2 ward three candidates @entity116 ( r ) and @entity29 ( @entity117 ) hand out election information in the race for the 3rd @entity64 , which includes the apartment complex where @entity81 was killed , @entity29 , 40 , easily defeated 76 - year - old retiree @entity116			2
@entity29 is a lawyer and a criminology professor who had to defend himself because of a third job - municipal judge in a neighboring town of @entity126 that , like @entity15 , derives a large percentage of its budget from municipal court fines			1
@entity116 had support of several national organizations whose volunteers went door - to - door on his behalf			0
@entity135 had support of a labor union and won easily in her four - person race			0
@entity62 , the former mayor who started the @entity15 campaign after the unrest that ravaged the community , also won easily in the 2nd @entity64			2
a strong push was made after the shooting to register more black voters last year , but just 562 new voters were added to the rolls			2
in recent weeks , the focus has been on getting those who are registered to vote			0
the high turnout came despite brutal weather			0
strong storms , including lightning and heavy rain , tore through the region for several hours before noon			0
but the weather did n't deter @entity157 , who has participated in @entity15 protests since august			2
she was voting in the 3rd @entity34 , which includes the @entity161 apartment complex where @entity81 was fatally shot			0
' i see there is raw material within this community to demonstrate hope , ' @entity157 said			0
' i see a glass that 's half full , and i feel that the people have the will to force change			0
' @entity172 @entity171 agreed , saying the election is where real change will occur			0
' as much change is needed here in @entity15 , this is where we begin - not out there in the streets , doing what they were doing - but , right here , ' @entity171 said			2
' they need to be voting and putting people in position to make the change and make the decisions that need to be made			0
