the @entity0 is about to go to war for the first time in its history after the @entity4 voted unanimously to intervene to fight rebels in the @entity6			1
around 3,000 @entity0 troops wearing the blue insignia , are being deployed to the @entity10 nation which has been wracked by years of civil war and lawlessness			1
the @entity0 has led a 14 - year - long peacekeeping in a bid to end the ethic conflict which was sparked by the genocide in neighbouring @entity17 when thousands of @entity18 fled into the @entity6 to evade justice			1
commander : @entity23 general @entity21 ( centre ) arrives in the eastern @entity6 city of @entity25 on tuesday this week			2
he will lead a @entity0 force against rebel fighters much of the fighting is now over the country 's natural resources which include large quantities of gold , copper , diamonds , and coltan ( a mineral used in cell phones )			1
according to the organisation @entity39 , the violence has killed as many as 5.4 million people making it the world 's bloodiest conflict since @entity43 the use of child soldiers in the conflict is also said to be common and in many areas armed gangs are free to roam at will terrorising local populations			0
but until now the conflict has been largely ignored by the outside world			0
it will be the first time that the @entity0 itself will be in direct control of a fighting force , responsible for the tactics on the ground , troop deployments and air strikes			1
@entity0 peacekeepers in pictured in @entity60 , @entity6 , in 2003			1
it will be the first time a @entity0 force has gone to war in the history of the organisation the force will be made up of soldiers from @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 and is under the command of @entity23 general @entity21 , who is credited with dismantling criminal gangs in @entity73 in 2007			1
it will be deployed against @entity75 ( march 23 ) rebels in the east of the country			0
speaking to the @entity80 last month general @entity21 said : ' the most critical area is nowadays the eastern part of the country			0
the @entity0 has expressed grave concern over the recruitment of child soldiers by rebels in the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
in a statement , the @entity0 strongly condemned ' the recruitment and use of children and all forms of human rights violations that are committed by the march 23 movement ( @entity75 ) and other armed groups against children			2
' the statement also called on the @entity75 rebels fighting in the @entity10 country to stop the violence and abuse against children , adding that ' they will be held personally responsible for violations committed against children who are recruited in their ranks			1
' last year , a report by @entity106 ( @entity106 ) revealed that a @entity6 rebel general , wanted by the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) on war crime charges , had forcefully recruited some 150 children			1
according to the report , rebel leader general @entity111 , known by the nom - de - guerre ' terminator ' due to his brutal methods , kidnapped children and teens from their homes , schools , fields and the roadsides in the volatile east of the @entity6			1
once joined the rebels , several of the boys were forced to walk ahead of the column of rebel soldiers to be the first to be shot in attacks , the report said			0
' i am ready to face the most difficult of scenarios			0
the main objective is to relieve the suffering of the people			0
' the @entity4 has gone to considerable lengths to ensure unanimous approval for the action			0
even @entity134 and @entity135 , normally reluctant to back such endeavours , voted in favour			1
but it is not without risk with some fearing that allowing a @entity0 force to intervene on one side in a civil war could do irreparable damage to the reputation of a supposedly impartial organisation			1
the @entity75 rebellion began in 2012 but has already led to around 800,000 people being forced to flee their homes			0
until recently neighbouring countries @entity17 and @entity150 have been supporting the @entity75 rebels but have recently abandoned them following reports of atrocities and international condemnation of the movement			2
much of the @entity6 is rich in mineral wealth and has vast agricultural potential			1
but the years of conflict has meant it has fallen behind the rest of @entity68 in terms of economic development			2
early signs have been encouraging , with representatives of the @entity75 movement this week announcing that they want to resume peace talks with the government			0
@entity168 , who heads the @entity75 delegation , said on tuesday that they are ' committed ' to the @entity150 - mediated talks despite plans to deploy @entity0 peacekeepers mandated to attack the rebels			2
the rebels had earlier insisted the talks were hopeless amid such plans			0
the change of tune illustrates the success of international military pressure on rebels who recently spoke of war if offensive peacekeepers were deployed in eastern @entity6			1
@entity168 , who heads the @entity75 delegation said the group was committed to peace talks			0
he said : ' we are still committed to the dialogue , the ceasefire , and to solving the root cause of the conflict '			0

the talks have often been set back by accusations and counter-accusations about who is responsible for rampant violence in @entity6 's @entity218			0
last year regional leaders under the @entity209 framework asked the @entity6 government to listen to the ' legitimate grievances ' of rebels who now control huge chunks of territory in eastern @entity6			2
the leaders also urged @entity75 to stop seizing more territory			0
the @entity4 has gone to considerable lengths to ensure unanimous approval for the action			0
