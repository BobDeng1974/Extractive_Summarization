the soft drinks and snacks were laid out , the music set to a sensible level and , more importantly , @entity4 was on hand to police proceedings			0
but @entity8 ’s early 15th birthday party soon spiralled out of control after word spread on @entity11 and @entity12 , attracting a crowd of about 800 teenagers by one estimate			1
over the next couple of hours – before police arrived and called time – the youngsters left an extraordinary trail of destruction that will cost up to £ 30,000 to put right			1
drunk teenagers smashed holes in the ceiling , drew on walls and ripped doors off their hinges as around 800 youngsters descended on the @entity31 home the party was thrown by @entity8 , 14 , but got out of control despite her mother , @entity34 , 56 , being there to try and keep order one neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it was like @entity39 in the 1970s out there			1
there were hundreds of people out to cause trouble ’ discord : a piano was smashed up in the front garden before police dispersed the rowdy youngsters horde : crowds of people outside the home			2
they were made aware of the party through social media sites witnesses at the party claimed teenagers had broken into the loft and were bouncing on ceiling insulation before one fell through into the bedroom offensive graffiti was scrawled on walls , doors were torn from their hinges and shelves were pulled down with their contents scattered around			1
the ceiling was left with a gaping hole after a group of teenagers got into the loft and leapt around on the insulation before one fell through			0
rumours on @entity12 suggested a hedgehog was flushed down a toilet and someone defecated on a bed			0
another report suggested a grand piano had been thrown into the garden from the £ 305,000 five - bedroom semi-detached home in @entity83 , @entity31			2
@entity8 ’s family denied this yesterday , saying it was an upright piano that had been in the garden at the start of the party but was destroyed by revellers			2
but one uncontested fact is that the 14 - year - old ’s mother , @entity34 , 56 , is now counting the cost following the sickening realisation their insurers will not pay for repairs as the revellers were invited into her home			1
why would they do this ? ’ said local church leader @entity100 , whose desperate pleas to party - goers were ignored as she tried to maintain control			2
‘ there must be £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 damage but insurance wo n’t pay out because we invited them in			1
‘ i told the parents i would be here to keep an eye out for trouble			0
there was n’t supposed to be drink but the police told me they confiscated an unbelievable amount of alcohol from the groups			0
’ aftermath : discarded alcohol lies strewn around the room among smashed and upended furniture debris : homeowner @entity126 knew the party had been advertised on @entity11 two weeks ago venue : the @entity83 house where the party was held			1
the damage caused by the party is estimated to be up to £ 30,000 wrecked : these cupboards were smashed open and ripped apart as drunk teens stormed the house mrs @entity8 admitted she had ignored warnings two weeks ago from her daughter ’s school that trouble was expected			1
staff at @entity142 in @entity143 – rated one of the best state schools in the country – warned against the open invitation that had been posted on @entity11			1
but the mother of two , who is married to computer consultancy owner @entity149 , 60 , and has a second daughter , @entity150 , 19 , said : ‘ i just did n’t think this would happen			2
i knew @entity8 knew some people but did not expect that many to turn up			0
’ the party , ahead of @entity8 ’s 15th in february , began at 7pm on friday and the chaos started within minutes , with people spilling out on to the road outside			2
one neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ it was like @entity39 in the 1970s out there			0
there were hundreds of people out to cause trouble			0
’ another said : ‘ it was absolute carnage as there were children pouring out of the house			2
‘ i would have said there was about 800 of them when the police turned up at around 8.30pm			0
they were trying to escape up the road , not realising it was a @entity174			0
’ @entity8 ’s name was even ‘ trending ’ on @entity12 at one stage due to the number of photographs being tweeted by revellers			0
