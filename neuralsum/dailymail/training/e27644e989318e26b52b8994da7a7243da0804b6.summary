learning about the incursion into @entity5 waters , @entity10 immediately demanded that the right - wing government of @entity2 prime minister @entity13 suspend its tough policy of turning away boats carrying desperate asylum - seekers			1
relations between the two countries are now at their lowest point in a decade , following revelations by @entity21 whistleblower @entity20 last year that in 2009 @entity2 government agents had tried to listen in to phone calls made by @entity5 president @entity24			1
the @entity2 navy ship @entity26 escorts asylum seeker boats off the coast of @entity29 asylum seekers from @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 cry as @entity5 officers force them to leave an @entity2 vessel			1
asylum seekers from @entity38 countries often travel thousands of miles in rickety boats to seek refuge in a statement issued last night , @entity5 said it deplored the @entity44 breaches and would ramp up its own patrols in areas where the @entity2 navy had intruded			1
observers feared last night that this could result in physical clashes between @entity2 and @entity5 vessels			0
the crisis erupted after immigration minister @entity53 admitted yesterday ( @entity54 ) that @entity2 navy vessels had entered @entity5 waters while conducting border protection operations - believed to mean stopping people seeking asylum by ' gatecrashing ' @entity2 territory			1
@entity10 responded immediately , declaring that ' the government of @entity5 deplores and rejects the violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity by the @entity2 vessels			0
an @entity2 army quick moving rubber boat , preparing for an operation at sea to stop a @entity70 tanker ( background ) with asylum seekers aboard from docking on their shores asylum seekers bound for @entity2 are evacuated by @entity5 authorities from a tanker in @entity77			0
many of the asylum seekers come from countries like @entity31 and @entity33 ' the government of @entity5 underlines that any of such violation of whatever basis constitutes a serious matter in bilateral relations of the two countries			0
' in what was conceived as a threat that physical action might be taken should @entity2 vessels continue to violate @entity5 waters , @entity10 said that it had the ' right to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with international laws and the charter of the @entity98			0
' @entity10 said it rejected @entity13 's recently - introduced polity to turn away @entity2 - bound boats carrying asylum - seekers who have made their way from countries such as @entity31 and @entity105 , stopping off in @entity5 before boarding fishing boats to sail to @entity2 islands			2
the latest crisis comes in the wake of claims by a group of asylum seekers who were turned back to @entity5 that @entity2 naval ships had fired guns across the bows of their boat - a claim that @entity118 has denied			2
@entity2 @entity119 has had a strict and long standing policy on asylum - seekers and immigration , but has only recently instituted a policy to turn boats away the influx of refugees has been a source of tragedy in recent years , when in 2010 , a boat full of asylum seekers bound for @entity2 crashed onto the rocks on @entity29			2
the survivors were rescued by a tanker , only to be turned away when they reached @entity5 almost as soon as those allegations had died down came the admission by @entity2 that its navy vessels had encroached into @entity5 waters to stop asylum - seeker boats from sailing on to @entity2 territory			1
immigration minister mr @entity53 admitted that there had been a ' number of incursions ' by @entity2 vessels into @entity5 waters during what is known as @entity145			0
but it is not known whether the navy ships were at the time turning back asylum seeker boats or were there for other reasons			2
' this was done unintentionally and without knowledge or sanction by the @entity2 government , ' said mr @entity53			0
foreign minister @entity155 has now apologised to @entity10 - and mr @entity53 said a more formal apology would be passed to the @entity5 government .			0
