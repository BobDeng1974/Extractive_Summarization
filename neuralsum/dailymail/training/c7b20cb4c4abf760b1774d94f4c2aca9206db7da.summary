by @entity0 for nine years , @entity1 longed to become pregnant			2
told she could not conceive naturally because her immune system was waging war on her fertility , the 27 - year - old turned to @entity6			2
four times doctors implanted embryos into mrs @entity1 's womb , and four times the procedure failed as her body killed off the ' foreign bodies '			1
in the face of their infertility , it was a rare treatment involving egg yolks being injected into mrs @entity1 's body , to suppress the ' natural killer cells ' in her system , that helped the couple realise their dream of becoming parents			1
for eight years @entity1 longed to fall pregnant , but doctors told her she would never conceive naturally because her immune system interpreted any embryos as a foreign body , killing them off			1
but in february the 27 - year - old gave birth to @entity30 , after four failed rounds of @entity6 mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity32 , also 27 , endured three failed rounds of @entity6 and one miscarriage and had almost given up hope of becoming parents when they heard about a rare treatment which could help			1
their gorgeous daughter was born on february 7 the treatment involved mrs @entity1 being injected with egg yolk and soya bean oil to suppress the killer cells in mrs @entity1 's system that were attacking the embryos seven years after being told she might never become a mother , mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity32 , also 27 , welcomed tiny @entity30 into the world in february			1
after enduring four failed @entity6 attempts - including one miscarriage - the couple were told they would have to opt for private care if they wanted more answers			1
baffled doctors were unable to diagnose the problem but @entity54 and mrs @entity1 could not stretch their finances to meet the cost , resigning themselves to never having their own children			2
distraught , mrs @entity1 told her husband to move on and find another wife who could give him the child he so desperately wanted			2
a year later , the couple heard about a rare treatment , giving them a glimmer of hope			2
the procedure involved mrs @entity1 having egg yolk and soya bean oil injected into her system through an iv drip			1
and on february 7 , the couple welcomed @entity30 into the world at @entity73			2
' i have five nieces and nephews and i honestly thought i would never go through that myself , ” said mrs @entity1 , from @entity78 , @entity79			2
mr and mrs @entity1 were first told they would never conceive naturally in 2007 , after being together for a year eighteen months later they started their rounds of @entity6 from october 2009 to april 2012 , three failing and a fourth resulting in a miscarriage the pair then stumbled across @entity86 , an infertility treatment centre in @entity88 , where a doctor told them mrs @entity1 's immune system was too strong , killing off embryos because it thought they were a foreign body the treatment is given to suppress natural killer ( @entity97 ) cells in a woman 's body , the theory being that some women ’s bodies are non-baby - friendly and their immune system attacks the embryo as if it were a foreign body			1
@entity106 — a mix of soya - bean oil , egg yolk , glycerine and water — are a fat emulsion used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for post-operative patients and premature babies requiring nutrition into their bloodstream			1
they have also been found to have an immuno - suppressant effect			0
the theory is that the intralipids have a stabilising effect on cell membranes , which makes it harder for the killer cells to attack and go on to cause implantation failure and miscarriage			2
the fats are highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose , the equivalent of a @entity134 bar — and have been likened to ‘ getting an armful of mayonnaise ’			0
administered via a drip usually twice before conception , and then three more times after , the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally			0
alongside this , women are also recommended to take steroids , which further suppress the immune system , and blood thinners to prevent blood clots , which also can impede embryos implanting			0
' it has just made our whole family , on both sides , complete			0
it is an amazing feeling , she is such a wanted baby			0
' she ’s 14 weeks old now and i ’m still in a bubble , i have to keep pinching myself and think " is this really me , am i a mum ? " ' i ’m still calling myself auntie to her by default because i still do n’t believe she is my daughter , i have to remind myself i ’m her mum			0
' the first blow for the couple came in 2007 , when after being together for a year and a half , they were told they would never be able to conceive a child naturally			0
after 18 months of ' filling out forms ' and having further tests , they started ivf treatment at the @entity172 and @entity173			0
they went through four attempts , between october 2009 and april 2012 , on the @entity176 , but each failed , and despite scrimping and saving they were unable to afford any more			0
the pair then stumbled across @entity86 , an infertility treatment centre in @entity88 , where a doctor told them mrs @entity1 ’s immune system was too strong , killing off embryos because it thought they were a foreign body			1
the 27 - year - old was given intravenous intralipid therapy , a treatment administered through an iv drip and made from soya bean oil , egg yolk , glycerin and water			1
the therapy stimulates the immune system to suppress so - called ' natural killer cells ' and allow an embryo to implant in the womb			1

' she 's 14 weeks old now and i 'm still in a bubble , i have to keep pinching myself and think is this really me , am i really a mum , ' said mrs @entity1 after just months , mrs @entity1 became pregnant when an embryo was implanted in her womb in april 2013			1
' it was a very nerve - wracking morning for us and the family , ' she said			0
' we both held onto the hope that this would be the one			0
i could tell when they put it in there , i could see she was a fighter and would be the one , i just sort of knew			0
' i did feel a bit weird knowing what was being put inside of me but after years of non-natural methods i was definitely on board with the more natural way			0
' she ’s 14 weeks old and i ’m still in a bubble , i have to keep pinching myself and think " is this really me , am i a mum " ? ' - @entity1 ' i just kept taking tests , we took the positive one at 5.05am before @entity32 went to work and we were just ecstatic , i woke all my family up to tell them ! ' it was such a contrast to before , i had tried to tell @entity32 to go off and have a baby with someone else because i felt i could n’t make him happy , and now we were looking at our own baby , after nine years			0
' he did n’t believe he was going to be a daddy until she was placed in his arms really , he kept avoiding the subject until he knew she was real , it was an incredible moment			0
' the couple have yet to decide if they will try for more children , but are enjoying the realisation of their eight - year dream with the birth of @entity30			2
mrs @entity1 said : ' we would n’t want to experience the heartache again , but we have stored embryos for three years so perhaps it will be an option			1
' but we ’ll never be disappointed because @entity257 is here and we have what we wanted			0

@entity1 and @entity261 discovered they could not conceive in 2007
three attempts at @entity6 failed while a fourth ended in miscarriage
the couple then discovered a rare treatment involving egg yolks
the egg , combined with soya bean oil , was injected into mrs @entity1
it worked to suppress the ' natural killer cells ' in her system , which had been fighting and killing off embryos identifying them as foreign bodies
she became pregnant months later and gave birth to @entity30 in february
