foam : a new acne drug trial produced no side effects , unlike those on the market a foam that ’s squirted on to the skin could be a radical new treatment for acne			1
it contains small amounts of a drug called minocycline , an antibiotic that ’s long been used to treat the condition			1
the treatment works by destroying the bacteria that lead to acne breakouts			2
although minocycline is effective when taken as a tablet , it can have nasty side - effects such as vertigo , dizziness , diarrhoea and mouth ulcers			1
however , it ’s hoped the new foam , which is gently rubbed on to spots and is absorbed within seconds , will slash the risk of adverse effects because the drug does not have to pass through the body before it reaches its target			1
early trials show the experimental foam , called @entity36 , is as effective as the drug in pill form , with a once - daily application reducing the number of spots by around 72 per cent over a three - month period			1
crucially , none of the 150 patients who took part in the trial reported major side - effects			1
acne affects eight out of ten teenagers and more than half of women over 25			2
hormonal changes cause the sebaceous glands in the skin to produce increased amounts of an oily substance called sebum			0
together with dead skin cells , the sebum blocks hair follicles , trapping bacteria that usually live harmlessly on the skin , where they actually help to protect against infection by a wide range of organisms			0
the main bacterium involved is propionibacterium acnes , or @entity70 , and , like others found on the skin , it needs a constant supply of oxygen to flourish			0
but trapped inside the skin , rather than living harmlessly on the surface , it is starved of its normal supply and starts to attack healthy skin cells in an attempt to access the oxygen that is circulating in the blood			0
meanwhile , the immune system , sensing the body is under attack , sends out white blood cells to try to ward off the bacteria			0
the result is the inflammation and swelling that leads to an angry - looking spot that can become itchy and sore before eventually erupting and , in some cases , scarring the skin			0
treatment : acne affects eight out of ten teenagers and more than half of women over 25 ( posed by model ) treatment ranges from creams and gels for mild acne with no underlying inflammation , to powerful antibiotics — such as minocycline — to kill bacteria in the skin			1
@entity110 firm @entity109 developed the foam as an alternative to tablets			0
unlike gels , ointments or creams , it disappears rapidly and leaves less of a sticky residue on the skin			0
the foam is due to enter the final stages of clinical trials next year and could be available within two to three years			2
dr @entity120 , consultant dermatologist at @entity121 in @entity122 , says using foam to deliver drugs to affected areas of the skin was potentially a good idea			0
but he warns : ‘ minocycline can cause unsightly pigmentation in scarred areas of the skin — even when taken as a tablet			1
‘ another issue is the development of antibiotic drug resistance , which is increased if antibiotics are used on the skin			2

@entity36 contains minocycline , an antibiotic long used to treat condition
but in tablet form it can have side effects *including* vertigo and diarrhoea
150 trial patients suffered no ill effects and it could be sold in two years
