by @entity0 and @entity1 federal judges have struck down gay marriage bans in @entity4 and @entity5 today in a pair of ruling that granted massive victories for same - sex couples and could force same - sex unions on four other states that currently ban them			1
in @entity4 , a judge threw out the state 's prohibition on gay marriages and ordered county clerks to immediately begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples			1
the ruling against @entity5 , one of the most conservative states in the nation , was more sweeping , though less immediate			0
the 10th @entity25 @entity24 in @entity26 , in ruling against @entity5 's gay marriage ban , said categorically that states can not ban same sex unions because they are protected under the 14th @entity30 , which guarantees equal protection under the law			1
@entity4 has begun issuing marriage licenses to same sex couples - while @entity5 's constitutional ban on gay marriage remains in place , pending appeal celebration : @entity42 , left , and @entity43 kiss after being married by @entity45 clerk @entity44 , center , in @entity47 following the federal judge 's ruling rushing in : @entity50 , right , kisses @entity51 as their sons @entity54 , 7 , left , and @entity55 , 4 , look on following their wedding in @entity47 the ruling affects six states in the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity5 and @entity64 - making such prohibitions illegal there , too			1
@entity62 already allows gay marriage , but the remaining states have laws prohibiting it			0
however , the three judge panel immediately put their ruling on hold pending appeal , which the @entity5 attorney general has promised to file			0
the next step is for the @entity25 @entity77 to take up the issue again			0
' a state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons , or refuse to recognize their marriage , based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union , ' the @entity59 said in its 2 - 1 ruling on @entity5			0
supporters of gay marriage in the conservative state , where the @entity92 church wields substantial political and social influence , planned a celebratory rally on wednesday night in @entity95			0
@entity5 briefly became the 18th @entity25 state where marriage rights were extended to same - sex couples when a federal district judge ruled in december 2013 that a state ban on gay matrimony was unconstitutional			1
that decision was put on hold by the @entity25 @entity77 pending appeals , but not before more than 1,300 gay and lesbian couples tied the knot			2
celebrating in @entity5 : from left , plaintiffs @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , two of the three couples who brought the lawsuit against @entity5 's gay marriage ban , stand together at a news conference outside their lawyer 's office in @entity95 @entity120 , right , and @entity121 , left , are married outside the @entity122 on wednesday in @entity123 , @entity4 @entity5 lawmakers who oppose gay marriage had argued that the state 's ban , known as @entity128 , was approved by voters and that same - sex marriages were new enough that evidence about their impact on families might not fully be known			1
but the court said the state could not restrict the right to marry , or its recognition of marriage , ' based on compliance with any set of parenting roles , or even parenting quality			0
' ' we can not embrace the contention that children raised by opposite - sex parents fare better than children raised by same - sex parents , ' it said in its ruling			0
separately , @entity25 district judge @entity151 in @entity47 said @entity4 's ban on same - sex marriage violated the @entity155 's due process and equal protection clauses , and he ordered officials to start issuing marriage licenses			1
and a legal battle over @entity161 's gay marriage ban intensified this week as state attorney general @entity162 said she will defend the measures approved by voters in 2008 in challenges to be heard soon in @entity166 and @entity167			2
@entity4 attorney general @entity168 has promised to appeal the ruling and asked he judge to stay his ruling and halt gay marriage in @entity4 , pending the appeal .			2

federal judge strikes down @entity4 gay marriage ban and orders county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples
the 10th @entity25 @entity24 in @entity26 *upheld* a lower court ruling *overturning* @entity5 's gay marriage ban
the sweeping ruling says the 14th @entity30 prohibits states from banning gay marriage in much of the west - @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity5 and @entity64
that ruling was stayed pending appeal to the @entity25 @entity77 and will not take effect
