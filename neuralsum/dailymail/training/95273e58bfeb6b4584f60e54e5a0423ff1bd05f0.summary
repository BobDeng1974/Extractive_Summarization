by @entity0 few are the men who do n't enjoy watching the football but @entity4 's passion for the beautiful game goes far beyond the norm			1
standing by her man : @entity9 says her boyfriend has a sweet and caring side a scion of @entity13 , @entity16 @entity15 's hardcore group of hooligan fans , the 37 - year - old was recently banned from every football ground in the @entity20 for four years after getting into a fight during a match in february and has been told he can not travel to @entity24 for the @entity25			1
' at the end of the the day , it 's not really about fighting , ' explains his other half , @entity9 , 43			1
' its all about going out , having some banter and doing a bit of shouting and bawling			0
' so what is sharing your life with a man so proud of his penchant for football violence he 's happy to appear on a documentary named @entity40 really like ? @entity9 , who says she hates football because it 's ' boring ' is surprisingly sanguine			1
' i 'm really not bothered [ about @entity4 's activities ] - it 's just shouting and roaring , ' she reveals			1
' i do n't find it intimidating , ' she continues			0
' i think you get more trouble down at the pub than you do on match day			0
' there 's never been a scrap - it 's not like he comes home with black eyes or something			2
even if they did try to do something , the police will split them up			0
' they used to go on the rampage , looting , throwing chairs and stuff , but you ca n't do that now - there 's police everywhere			2
' that , however , does n't mean @entity4 himself is n't a fan of fisticuffs			2
' at the age of 13 , i started to want to fight , ' he says			2
i 'm after , like , danger			0
football violence is a feeling on its own			1
' despite his tough words , @entity9 says the @entity4 she knows is someone quite different - and who often brings her flowers and makes romantic gestures			1
' he 's got a nice side , he 's caring , ' she reveals , before adding : ' he 's got a big gob though			1
he has a huge trap on him ! ' nevertheless , she says there are some downsides to living with an extreme football fan			0
' it 's chaos [ on match day ] - the house is full of @entity16 and @entity105 fans , ' explains @entity9 , who also has a football mad 21 - year - old son			1
' @entity108 is all you hear all day and night in my house , ' she complains			0
' i end up having to go out ! ' worse , with the @entity25 upon us , @entity9 is having to contend with a solid month of football , football and more football			1
' no , i 'm not , ' she says when asked if she 's looking forward to kick off in @entity24			2
' i 'll leave and go to my sister 's ! ' not allowed : mr @entity4 is among those banned from travelling to @entity24 for the @entity25 which starts tomorrow fears : known hooligans such as mr @entity4 have been banned from travelling for fear of scenes like this not so scary : according to ms @entity9 , people get into more trouble down at their local pub she would , however , be happy for @entity4 to put up a few @entity128 flags if he wants to			1
' he can if he wants , ' she says			0
' he put up a big @entity16 flag for the documentary			1
' despite the impending football fest in @entity24 , the @entity132 documentary , @entity40 and @entity133 , is what is really causing her a few sleepless nights			1
' i am a bit worried about how they will portray him in the documentary , ' she confesses			0
what if he comes across as a thug ? ' he is a thug , ' she ripostes , adding : ' but it 's not just him - there 's thousands of them			0
' and she is n't wrong			0
@entity4 is behind a 50,000 strong @entity149 group where hooligans - would - be and current - can go to exchange gossip and organise meetings			1
' they just all go on the site for the banter and talk a load of crap , ' says @entity9			2
' i do n't go on it - it 's boring			0
' while she might find it boring , she says football hooligans certainly are n't as black as they 're painted by the media and the authorities			0
' they 're just a bunch of lads going to the football who go and have a row with opposing fans			2
if that 's the case , then everyone 's a hooligan			0
' if they do something down the pub , they just get sent home to sober up but if they do something in the stadium , they get arrested			0
' really , if they [ @entity4 and his friends ] are hooligans , then everyone 's a hooligan			1
' that does n't mean she has any sympathy for @entity4 and his four year ban , however			2
' if he 's going to the match and they 're going to cause bother , then he knows what 's going to happen to him , ' she raps			0
' it 's his own fault ! ' @entity4 appears on @entity40 and @entity133 , tonight at 9pm on @entity132			1
