by @entity0 you 've probably sung along to @entity3 ’s @entity2 a million times			2
but would you be able to recite the words right now ? apparently not , according to a nationwide poll which found the 1976 classic has the most commonly misheard song lyrics			2
nearly a quarter of those surveyed got the words wrong , believing the @entity12 quartet are singing about a rather more violent scenario than one usually played out on dance floors			0
@entity3 's @entity2 is one of the most mistaken lyrics with listeners believing they are singing : ' see the girl , watch her scream , kicking the dancing queen ' even @entity20 is misunderstood with fans singing ' kicking your cat all over the place ' some of @entity26 's fans lose the run of themselves when he is thought to sing ' it does n't make a difference if we 're naked or not ' instead of the correct lyric , ‘ see that girl , watch that scene , diggin ’ the dancing queen ’ , they thought @entity3 sing , ‘ see that girl , watch her scream , kicking the dancing queen ’			1
we will rock you by @entity2 was the second most misheard song , with nearly a fifth of respondents thinking lead singer @entity20 says , ‘ kicking your cat all over the place ’ , rather than , ‘ kicking your can all over the place ’			1
and even with the clue in the title of the @entity46 ’ 1966 hit i ’m @entity48 , 12 per cent think the band are singing , ‘ then i saw her face , now i ’m gon na leave her ’ , rather than , ‘ now i ’m a believer ’			0
fans regularly re-write the lyrics of their favourite bands - sometimes with hilarious consequences the poll of 2,000 adults found @entity60 frontman @entity59 was the star who is most difficult to understand , with 28 per cent of respondents struggling to make out his words			1
the study by online streaming service @entity65 also revealed that we are less likely to understand more modern genres of music			0
some 56 per cent said fast - paced rap and hip hop songs are the most difficult to understand , while emotive indie - rock songs by bands such as @entity73 came second on 13 per cent			0
veteran @entity75 singer @entity74 is believed to be far more experienced as listeners think she has been ' touched for the thirty - first time ' @entity75 singer @entity78 is believed to have been heartbroken by many listeners as he ' can see clearly now @entity80 has gone ' @entity81 meanwhile has been mistaken as singing ' scuse me while i kiss this guy ' meanwhile 80s group @entity84 are accused of building this city ' on logs and coal '			1
