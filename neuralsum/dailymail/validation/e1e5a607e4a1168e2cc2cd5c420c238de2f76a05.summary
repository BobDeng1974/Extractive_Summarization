@entity0 for the title ? that extraordinary possibility can not now be batted away as pure whimsy after @entity5 ’s prolific goal run continued , inspiring his side to overcome @entity7			1
this win does n’t merely cement @entity0 ’s top - four place but gives @entity10 and @entity11 above them reason to look over shoulders with increasing concern			1
@entity5 ’s goals came within a four - minute first - half spell , the first off his thigh , the second from a header			1
they take the 28 - year - old ’s recent tally to nine goals in nine games in all competitions			0
he also has eight in six games against @entity7 since his £ 10million move in summer 2012 from @entity29			2
@entity5 gives @entity0 the lead in the 28th minute as he diverts @entity32 's header into @entity7 's goal with his left thigh @entity7 goalkeeper @entity35 ca n't get to the ball as @entity5 's effort heads towards the bottom corner of his goal the @entity41 striker celebrates his first goal of the game with team - mates @entity44 and @entity32 ( right ) at @entity46 @entity7 : @entity35 6 , @entity47 6.5 , @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 5.5 , @entity50 5.5 , @entity51 5 ( @entity52 72 ) , @entity53 7 , @entity54 6 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 5.5 ( @entity57 89 ) , @entity58 7 subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 goal : @entity53 48 booked : none @entity0 : @entity67 7 , @entity68 6 , @entity44 6 , @entity69 6.5 , @entity70 5.5 , @entity71 7 , @entity72 7 , @entity73 6 ( @entity74 71 ) , @entity32 6.5 ( @entity75 89 ) , @entity76 6.5 ( @entity77 71 ) , @entity5 8 subs not used : @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 goals : @entity5 24 , 28 booked : none @entity85 : @entity5 referee : @entity87 7 attendance : 50,544 * @entity90 ratings by @entity91 at @entity46 @entity5 opened the scoring for @entity0 - click here for more in our @entity94 @entity7 were a distant second best in the first half but were impressive after the break , testing @entity0 ’s mettle as @entity53 gave them a consolation			1
the upshot is @entity0 are just a point behind @entity11 and four behind leaders @entity10 , albeit with @entity10 having two games in hand			1
@entity10 remain odds - on favourites to win the title race			2
but whisper it : this is a race now of sorts , a contest at least , with the season ’s biggest prize remaining a feasible for more than one team , for now			0
‘ @entity10 at the moment i feel have enough [ of a ] cushion to be serene , ’ said @entity0 ’s manager @entity116 , asked about his side ’s title chances			1
‘ @entity10 have too much security			2
’ but asked if his players believe they can now cause what would be an amazing upset , he added : ‘ we are in a fight right until the end			0
we will keep on fighting			0
’ @entity116 ’s counterpart @entity129 said : ‘ until they scored the two goals i thought we were in it			0
but we conceded from two set plays and that ’s disappointing			0
’ leaving aside the two - legged exit to @entity137 in the @entity138 , things have been going @entity0 ’s way of late			2
they have won 14 of their last 16 games , and all six of their last six games			0
that is title - challenging form and their eight @entity146 fixtures to come offer the tantalising opportunity to advance their own cause while damaging those immediately around them			0
@entity5 holds off his marker to head @entity0 into a two - goal lead just four minutes after opening the scoring @entity72 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right ) congratulate @entity5 following his second goal of the afternoon @entity5 , who now has nine goals in his last nine games in all competitions , salutes @entity0 's travelling supporters after the final whistle @entity7 midfielder @entity53 finishes a cross from @entity55 to get @entity129 's side back into the match @entity0 goalkeeper @entity67 can only watch helplessly as @entity53 's effort nestles into the bottom corner of his goal @entity53 points to the sky as he celebrates scoring @entity7 's first @entity146 goal since february 28 their next game is at home to @entity172 in a fortnight before a trip to @entity175			1
after that comes what could prove to be a pivotal showdown against @entity10 — at the @entity179			2
they then play at @entity181 , at home to @entity183 and at @entity184 before finishing with back - to - back home games against @entity186 and @entity187			0
@entity7 , relatively safe but unremarkable in mid-table continue to frustrate their fans — although they came flying from the blocks in the second half			1
@entity129 brushed aside any suggestion his team are free - wheeling			0
‘ in the second half we took the game to them and we can take a lot from that , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re not on the beach in flip - flops , that ’s for sure			0
’ @entity0 found fertile territory down the right , winning a series of set - pieces			2
@entity76 ’s free - kick found @entity73 on the left and his shot was blocked by @entity47			0
another @entity76 cross was aimed at @entity5 but @entity35 gathered it			1
then came the free - kick that broke the deadlock , @entity76 delivering to @entity32 , whose flicked head - on fell into the path of @entity5 , off whose leg the ball flew in			1
@entity214 international @entity71 brings the ball down under pressure from @entity7 defender @entity49 @entity7 forward @entity54 ( second from left ) attacks a corner as @entity32 and @entity5 help out the @entity0 defence two - goal hero @entity5 is left grimacing in a heap on the floor after a challenge by a @entity7 player @entity7 forward @entity58 smashes the post in the second half as @entity68 and @entity72 attempt to block his shot two minutes later it was 2 - 0 , with @entity76 again the provider , this time from a corner			1
@entity5 was being ‘ marked ’ by @entity49 , or rather @entity49 was standing next to him as the ball came in			2
@entity5 did not even need to launch himself from the ground to meet the ball with his head , simply leaning forward to steer home			1
@entity7 responded with a hat - trick of chances in 40 seconds			0
@entity56 ’s left - footed shot was blocked , as was @entity53 ’s shot , and then @entity55 ’s header			1
after the break their urgency increased still further			0
they reduced the deficit after @entity47 and @entity55 exchanged passes , and @entity55 crossed to @entity53 , who converted			1
@entity7 ’s tails were up and @entity58 twice unleashed powerful shots that went narrowly over			0
@entity54 then shot straight at @entity67 before @entity49 tested the @entity0 keeper properly with a header			2
@entity67 made a brilliant reaction save with his legs from @entity58 four minutes from time to keep @entity0 ’s lead intact — and a dream run at the title still viable			1
@entity0 boss @entity116 gives out instructions to his players during his side 's sixth successive @entity146 victory @entity0 forward @entity73 ( left ) drives into @entity7 's box as midfielder @entity260 tries to stay with him @entity7 striker @entity58 and @entity0 defender @entity44 battle for the ball in the air during the first half @entity7 boss @entity129 tries to tackle @entity0 forward @entity32 during a feisty second half at @entity46 @entity32 shields the ball from @entity54 as @entity0 keep up the pressure on @entity11 and @entity10 at the top of the table @entity273 international @entity272 pulls off a save at point blank range to deny @entity7 a goal at @entity46 @entity7 midfielder @entity55 desperately attempts to block a cross from @entity0 midfielder @entity71			1

@entity5 diverted @entity32 's header past @entity35 to give @entity0 a 28th minute lead
the @entity41 headed home his side 's second goal of the afternoon just four minutes later
@entity53 gave @entity7 hope early in the second half when he converted a cross from @entity55
the result leaves @entity0 just a point behind @entity11 and four off leaders @entity10
