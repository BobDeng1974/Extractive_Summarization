by @entity0 published : 12:04 est , 7 august 2013 updated : 19:18 est , 7 august 2013 a fossil of a squirrel - like creature , described as a ' great - great - grand uncle 165 million years removed ' of modern man , has been discovered in @entity6			1
the ancient mammalian relative , called @entity8 , is one of the best - preserved fossils of the mammaliaform groups , which are long - extinct relatives to modern mammals			1
the discovery in @entity14 has also provided evidence that traits such as hair and fur originated well before the rise of the first true mammals			1
an artist 's impression of a @entity8			0
the small mammal is older than @entity24 and had reptilian features and long poisonous spurs			1
discovered in @entity6 by the @entity27 , the creature has been compared to a modern - day squirrel and may be one the most ancient relatives of humans the earliest evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of @entity35 , from 164 million years ago in the @entity36			1
during the 1950s scientists suggested that the passages in the front of the upper jawbones of the @entity35 were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to whiskers			0
this is thought to have been the first evidence of hair or fur			2
more recent research claims that the passages do n't prove that the animal had whiskers because modern - day lizards have almost identical facial structures			0
believed to date back around 165 million years , @entity8 co-existed with feathered dinosaurs in the @entity55 era , nearly 100 million years before @entity24 roamed @entity56			1
@entity57 , professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the @entity27 said : ' we finally have a glimpse of what may be the ancestral condition of all mammals , by looking at what is preserved in @entity8			0
' it allows us to piece together poorly understood details of the critical transition of modern mammals from pre-mammalian ancestors			0
' preserved in the fossil is a halo of guard hairs and underfur residue , making @entity8 only the second known pre-mammalian fossil with fur			1
it was also found with sparse hairs around its abdomen			0
on its heel , @entity8 had a long spur made from a tough protein substance which was thought to have been poisonous			1
similar to those found on modern egg - laying mammals , such as male platypuses , this spur is evidence that this fossil was most likely a male member of its species			1
researchers have described the @entity8 as being similar to modern - day squirrels , pictured			2
the fossil was found with sparse hairs on the animal 's abdomen and fur around the top of the creature			1
this makes @entity8 only the second known pre-mammalian fossil to have fur professor @entity57 said : ' @entity8 confirms that many modern mammalian biological functions related to skin and integument had already evolved before the rise of modern mammals			1
' the biological features of @entity8 are described by scientists from the @entity27 in the journal @entity113			0
a terrestrial animal about the size of a large ground squirrel , @entity8 was likely an omnivore , possessing clearly mammalian dental features and jaw hinge			2
its molars had elaborate rows of cusps for chewing on plants , and some of its anterior teeth possessed large cusps that allowed it to eat insects and worms , perhaps even other small vertebrates			0
it had teeth with high crowns and fused roots similar to more modern , but unrelated , mammalian species such as rodents			0
its high - crowned teeth also appeared to be slow growing like modern placental mammals			0
the skeleton of the @entity8 , and in particular its hind - leg bones and finger claws would have given the animals a gait similar to modern armadillos , pictured			2
a previously unknown type of movement in mammaliaforms the skeleton of @entity8 - especially its hind - leg bones and finger claws - likely gave it a gait similar to modern armadillos , a previously unknown type of movement in mammaliaforms			1
prof @entity57 and his team identified clearly non-mammalian characteristics such as its primitive middle ear , still attached to the jaw , is often seen in reptiles			0
the @entity8 ' anklebones and vertebral column are also similar to the anatomy of previously known mammal - like reptiles			2
professor @entity57 said : ' we can not say that @entity8 is our direct ancestor , but it certainly looks like a great - great - grand uncle 165 million years removed			1
' these features are evidence of what our mammalian ancestor looked like during the @entity176 - @entity55 transition			0
' @entity8 shows that many adaptations found in modern mammals were already tried by our distant , extinct relatives			2
' in a sense , the three big branches of modern mammals are all accidental survivors among many other mammaliaform lineages that perished in extinction			0
' the fossil is now in the collections in @entity188 of @entity189 in @entity6 .			0

the squirrel - type creature is thought to date back before the @entity24
it had a *potentially* poisonous spur on its heel to ward off *predators*
described as ' great - great - grand uncle 165 million years removed of man '
it was also found with hair , making it only the second pre-mammalian fossil to be found with fur
