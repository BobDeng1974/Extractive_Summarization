@entity16 and his family arrived at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 and quickly realized the man in the casket was not @entity16 's father , @entity23 who died on november 21 and the age of 80			1
making matters worse for the grieving family , the funeral home had already buried @entity4 in a plot in @entity29 , instead of next to his beloved wife @entity30 who predeceased him in 2006 , at @entity31			1
a distraught @entity32 immediately alerted staff at the home to the mix - up , but says he was dismissed by @entity37 staff who told him a mix - up was impossible			0
although they were convinced the man was not @entity4 , having his identical twin , @entity39 , present at the viewing showed that the man in the casket looked nothing like @entity4			2
' i kept looking at him			0
and i was like , there 's no way he could be this much changed , ' @entity16 told @entity51			0
the man in the coffin had an ' extreme receding hairline ' as opposed to @entity4 's head of white hair , and a completely different nose			1
but when @entity16 alerted @entity58 staff to the mistake he was dismissed by funeral home staff who told him a mix - up was impossible			2
mix - up : the @entity18 has not spoken publicly about the mix - up that saw them bury the wrong man and put a stranger on display for a viewing grieving son : @entity16 was denied the chance to pay his respects to his father at an open casket viewing on friday the funeral director refused to see the family until , 15 minutes later , a member of staff checked the toe - tag on the man in @entity4 's casket - which proved beyond a doubt that the wrong man had been put on display			1
' this just is n’t right			0
this should never , never happen			0
this is something you read in a fiction novel or see in a movie on tv , ' @entity16 told @entity51			0
adding insult to injury , the funeral home had dressed the wrong man in @entity4 's @entity2 uniform			1
@entity4 was a decorated colonel and the uniform had taken him 28 years to earn			0
the burial he deserves : @entity4 's family just want to bury him with full military honors ' my dad ’s uniform ... that ’s degradation beyond words for a military man , ' @entity98 told @entity51 , his voice breaking with emotion			1
the family , not knowing what else to do , called police who told them that mixing up bodies inside a funeral home is not a crime			2
' they say now they have to wait for monday to get a judge to get an order for the body to be dug up , ' @entity16 said			2
the funeral was scheduled for saturday , but without a body to bury , it 's unclear if the family went ahead with the service .			0

@entity4 's family went to pay their last respects on friday at @entity18 , @entity20
when they arrived , they realized the man in @entity4 's casket was not him
the funeral home mistakenly buried @entity4 in a plot in @entity29
the stranger was dressed in @entity4 's military uniform
the family had to wait until today for a judge to issue an order to *exhume* @entity4 's body
