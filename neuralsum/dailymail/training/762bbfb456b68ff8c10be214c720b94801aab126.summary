less than a week later , @entity0 underwent brain surgery , with consultants able to remove 98 per cent of the tumour , which proved non-cancerous by @entity4 published : 08:16 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 08:17 est , 28 may 2013 a 19 - year - old 's routine eye test ended up saving her life after optician ’s found a tumour the size of an egg attached to her retina was pushing against her brain			1
student @entity16 , from @entity17 , @entity18 , was taken by her father to optician , @entity20 , for a regular check - up after battling nausea and severe headaches for months			1
after specialists had studied her retina , the light - sensitive nerve layer at the back of her eye , they were stunned at their discovery			2
a routine eye test carried out at her local opticians showed that one of @entity0 's retinas was completely swollen and the ' wrong shape ' because of a tumour the back of @entity0 ’s eye was completely swollen and the ‘ wrong shape ’ which led them to discover a potentially fatal brain tumour last october			1
within hours , she was in the @entity43 , where she was diagnosed with a rare type of tumour which had grown to the size of a small egg and had been pressing on her brain			1
@entity50 said : ' i ’d been feeling ill for about six months and had been to the doctors about four or five times			2
' i had an eye test in april and everything was normal			0
but when my dad took me back in october , it was a very different story - we know something was wrong and i was told my retina was swollen			1
' instead of it being concave it was convex and my central vision had become poor			0
' i was told that i would be referred			0
the next day , i was in hospital			0
' @entity50 , who had felt ill with headaches and nausea for six months before her diagnosis , underwent a four - hour operation to remove 98 per cent of the tumour , which could have become life - threatening if left untreated in less than a week , @entity0 was undergoing brain surgery , with consultants able to remove 98 per cent of the tumour , which proved not cancerous			1
her father @entity76 , 51 , who runs a garden centre with wife @entity78 , 46 , said : ' @entity0 was so young but she coped well			1
' when we talked to the consultant , he said she could have [ died ] at any time			0
' this shows why it is a good idea , whatever age , to have a regular eye test			2
' the 19 - year - old faced a gruelling four - hour operation to remove the tumour			1
@entity0 ( pictured in hospital ) discovered that her headaches had been caused by the position of the tumour			1
it had been pressing on the tubes that drain fluid from her brain as soon as she arrived at the @entity43 , @entity0 was given steroids to help bring down the dangerous inflammation			1
four days later , she travelled to @entity102 ’s @entity101 , for intricate brain @entity104 said : ' it was a really worrying time for everyone			2
post-operation : @entity0 and her parents later found out that the tumour was non-cancerous ' we were told that the tumour might be cancerous but it would need to be tested after it was removed			1
' the position of the tumour meant it had been pressing on the tubes that drain fluid from the brain			2
pressure had been building up and that ’s why it had affected @entity0 ’s retina and it can be fatal			1
' @entity0 ’s news shocked her family , who rallied round to support her and try to pull her through			2
but as doctors were unable to predict just how much of the tumour needed to be removed , there was a great risk that it could be cancerous and further treatment may be essential			0
@entity76 said : ' @entity0 was brave.the tumour was in the ventricle cavity and was attached to the brain			1
' it was unclear just how much could be removed without upsetting anything			0
' at the same time , we knew it was @entity0 ’s only hope			2
' @entity0 had been feeling quite unwell for the best part of last year			2
' she ’d had headaches and episodes of sickness			0
she was pale and tired and was generally just not herself			0
' @entity50 ’s mother , @entity78 , 46 , followed their daughter to the @entity102 hospital and stayed with her until the early hours			0
she said : ' we kept ringing the hospital to find out if she was out of the operating theatre			0
people die on the operating table - it happens			0
' but finally , we got the news that she was in recovery and she was all right			0
we were told that the tumour had to be tested and we ’d have to wait a week for the results			2
it was another anxious time			0
@entity78 ( left ) said doctors told her that there was a chance the tumour might start to grow again			0
but she is optimistic because @entity0 's growth was n't cancerous or fast - growing ' but when we heard that the tumour was not cancerous it was wonderful			1
' after the op , we were told that 98 per cent of the tumour had been removed			1
some of it had been attached to the brain and had been impossible to get out			0
' the surgeon did n’t want to damage @entity0 ’s brain and decided to leave it in @entity168 was a chance , we were told , that it might start to grow again			1
' but it was n’t cancer and it was n’t a fast - growing thing			0

@entity16 , 19 , had a regular appointment at her optician , in @entity17
