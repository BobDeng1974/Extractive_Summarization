first lady @entity0 was frustrated with her husband ’s advisers and clashed with then chief of staff @entity3 , especially over the push for health care overhaul			1
a book slated to be released this tuesday tells of a divided @entity8 where tensions developed between mrs @entity0 and mr @entity3 , with their relationship became increasingly frosty			1
the two rarely saw eye to eye			0
the book reveals several fascinating bits of information - from mr @entity3 rebuffing the first lady ’s chief of staff , @entity15 , from attending a morning meeting of top staffers , to mrs @entity0 ’s reticence to campaign in the 2010 midterm elections			1
@entity21 : @entity23 's book reveals @entity0 ( left ) and @entity25 's former chief of staff @entity3 ( right ) ' butted heads ' arguably the most prominent point of contention @entity28 reporter @entity23 reveals between the first lady and mr @entity3 was the friction over healthcare reform and mrs @entity0 ’s scepticism of so - called backroom deals being cut			1
the tensions originated after the seat left open by @entity38 senator @entity37 was eventually lost to @entity40 @entity39 , jeopardizing the success of her husband 's legislation			0
the president received the brunt of his wife ’s fury , ms @entity23 writes in her book , the @entity50			2
he reportedly told his aides : ‘ she feels as if our rudder is n’t set right			0
’ mrs @entity0 ‘ made it clear that she thought her husband needed a new team , according to her aides , ’ ms @entity23 said			1
influential : the book claims that @entity0 is more powerful within the @entity8 than previously thought she writes : ‘ to her , the @entity39 victory provided grim evidence for what she had been saying for months , in some cases years : ( her husband ) had been leaning on the same tight group of insular , disorganised advisers for too long			1
‘ they were not careful planners who looked out for worst - case scenarios			0
’ according to ms @entity23 , early in 2010 as the president 's health care agenda seemed in danger of collapsing , mrs @entity0 let it be known she was annoyed by how the @entity8 was handling the strategy			1
after media reports indicated mr @entity3 was unhappy pursuing the health care overhaul , he offered to resign , ms @entity23 wrote			1
the president declined the offer			0
‘ your punishment is that you have to stay here and get this bill done , ’ the president said , according to then senior adviser @entity85			0
‘ i ’m not letting you off the hook			0
not welcomed : @entity0 's chief of staff @entity15 ( pictured ) was rebuffed from a morning meeting by @entity3 , the books says from past sour experiences with another @entity8 wife – former first lady and current secretary of state @entity97 - mr @entity3 tried to avoid mrs @entity0			1
ms @entity23 writes that the @entity99 wings became so separate from each other that some referred to the @entity102 as ‘ @entity103 – pleasant but powerless			2
’ for one thing , mrs @entity0 's former chief of staff @entity15 was rebuffed by mr @entity3 to attend a top - staff 7:30am @entity8 meeting			1
but that is only one of many startling anecdotes ms @entity23 reveals			2
' @entity0 and @entity3 had almost no bond			1
they were the president 's two spouses , in a sense , one public and official and one private and informal			0
' in 2009 , mr @entity3 told @entity117 ( @entity118 ) that the first lady would make an appearance at an event to lobby for an energy bill , without asking mrs @entity0 ’s permission first			1
mrs @entity0 was depending on @entity125 ’s vote on the health care legislation			1
@entity125 , meanwhile , was banking on her support in defeating a challenger in his predominately black constituency			0
the @entity102 staff reportedly knew @entity125 was planning to vote against the health care overhaul – though he later voted in favour of the final bill			1
upheaval : @entity3 , left , offered to resign as chief of staff over health reform @entity125 told the @entity137 that the event was held in @entity139 , more than 600 miles away from his district , and said : ‘ i never heard any words like that or spoke any words like that , ’ referring to the link between @entity0 ’s visit and the environmental vote			1
mrs @entity0 manifested her frustration by remaining reluctant to campaign for the midterms , former aides said			1
anger : mrs @entity0 and mr @entity3 clashed in 2009 over a visit to @entity117 ( @entity153 , pictured ) the two were often jockeying to win the president 's opinion			1
‘ @entity0 and @entity3 had almost no bond , ’ ms @entity23 writes , saying that from the get - go , the two were awkward			1
‘ they were the president ’s two spouses , in a sense , one public and official and one private and informal			0
’ in an excerpt published by the @entity28 friday night , ms @entity23 also revealed mrs @entity0 's priorities			2
' she does think there are worse things than losing an election , ' @entity166 said after the 2010 midterm elections			0
the first lady 's former chief of staff added : ' being true to yourself , for her , is definitely more important			0
' the @entity28 's adaptation of the book portrays mrs @entity0 as having gone through an evolution from struggle to fulfillment in her role at the @entity8 , but all the while an ' unrecognised force ' in pursuing the president 's goals			1
she is seen publicly as the friendly and popular face of the softer side of the @entity8 , the one reading to school kids or promoting exercise as a means to reduce child obesity			2
preceding the 2010 elections , the three were at odds at how to best approach them			2
mrs @entity0 , having just been confronted by a second - grader whose mother did n’t have immigration papers , was strongly pushing for her husband to address the importance of immigration reform			1
' to her , the @entity39 victory provided grim evidence for what she had been saying for months , in some cases years : ( her husband ) had been leaning on the same tight group of insular , disorganized advisers for too long ; they were not careful planners who looked out for worst - case scenarios			0
' mr @entity3 , however , did n’t see the need , as he thought the legislation did n’t stand the chance for approval			2
though mr @entity212 ended up making the speech , his remarks were widely forgotten because , as ms @entity23 says , the media was questioning an issue that had not been cultivated enough in the public eye			0
she writes : ‘ @entity0 became quietly furious at his team for not giving the address more support … ' the first lady fumed too : she took it as more proof that her husband ’s advisers were poorly serving him			2
’ controversy : remarks made by mrs @entity0 to @entity227 required a damage limitation exercise in the @entity8 among the more provocative anecdotes , ms @entity23 recounts a scene in which mr @entity231 , frustrated after tamping down a potential public relations crisis involving the first lady , exploded when presidential adviser @entity234 told him the first lady had concerns about the @entity8 response to the flap			1
the initial commotion had been over an alleged remark by @entity0 to @entity241 first lady @entity227 that living in the @entity8 was ' hell			1
' mr @entity231 cursed the first lady , who was absent			0
ms @entity23 writes that mr @entity231 later said his anger was misplaced and that he blamed ms @entity234 for creating the confrontation			0
the @entity8 had a cold reaction to the book , calling it an ' over-dramatisation of old news ' and emphasising that the first couple did not speak to the author , who last interviewed them for a magazine piece in 2009			1
new responsibilities : the first lady was at first unsure of her role , despite her glamorous reception ' the emotions , thoughts and private moments described in the book , though often seemingly ascribed to the president and first lady , reflect little more than the author 's own thoughts , ' @entity8 spokesman @entity259 said			1
' these secondhand accounts are staples of every administration in modern political history and often exaggerated			0
' ms @entity23 , who began reporting on the @entity50 in 2007 , said that in 2008 , mrs @entity0 was thinking of delaying her move to @entity273 so her daughters could adjust to being the first children , perhaps not fully realising the message that would project			2
adviser @entity234 said she chose to move to the @entity8 after her husband was elected because of ‘ wanting her family to be together			2
’ aides said in her early tenure as first lady , mrs @entity0 struggled with insecurity about her new role , despite a public outpouring of admiration for her glamour and poise			2
the @entity289 - educated lawyer battled with the traditionally ‘ shapeless post			0
’ she was deeply frustrated with elements of her new life , including the fact that she could no longer take her daughters to school functions without fear of causing a commotion			0
next to normal : aides said the first lady was at first unsure about her very public role , which meant no more shopping trips without the @entity302 and a handful of staffers other rituals that many consider mundane – grocery shopping for one – were now a dangerous endeavour which required sweeps of stores and an arsenal of @entity302 agents			0
one aide said she felt additional pressure because she is the first @entity317 first lady			0
she wanted to bring grace and sophistication to her new post , but was discouraged of being lavish by the president ’s advisers because of stormy joblessness reports and corporate bailouts			0
she felt as though ‘ everyone was waiting for a black woman to make a mistake , ’ the former aide said			0
the @entity28 posted a 3,300 - word adaption of the book , @entity50 , on its website friday night			2
the accounts are based on interviews with 30 current and former aides , though president @entity212 and the first lady declined to be interviewed for the book .			0
