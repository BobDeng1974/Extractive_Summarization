by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:36 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 24 january 2013 @entity3 will lead a new global clampdown on ‘ aggressive ’ tax avoiders , @entity2 vowed today			1

the government has been under pressure to take action after a public backlash against firms including @entity12 , @entity39 and @entity40 who report multi-million pound revenues in the @entity3 but pay little or no tax			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ after years of abuse , people across the planet are calling for more action and most importantly , there is gathering political will to actually do something about it			0
he said the @entity22 – consisting of @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , the @entity3 and the @entity61 – would ‘ drive a more serious debate on tax evasion and avoidance			1
mr @entity2 told business leaders that tax avoidance harmed public services and pushed up bills for those who pay their way deputy prime minister @entity66 questioned the need for the pm to travel to @entity17 , claiming it was ' debatable ' that anything is achieved			1
but challenging the audience of some of the world ’s biggest companies , mr @entity2 warned : ‘ there 's nothing wrong with sensible tax planning , and there are some things governments want people to do that reduce tax bills , such as investing in pensions , start - up businesses or charities			1
‘ but some forms of avoidance have become so aggressive that i think it is right to say these raise ethical issues and it 's time to call for more responsibility and for governments to act accordingly			2
’ mr @entity2 later met @entity60 's prime minister @entity94 in @entity17 , to discuss his plans for the @entity3 presidency of the @entity22 @entity2 was today was branded ' @entity98 's scaredy - cat ' in an editorial by the @entity57 news magazine @entity100 over his plans for an @entity103 referendum			1
in an online piece published today , it was claimed the pm ’s pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 was driven by ‘ fear ’			0
‘ fear of his party , fear of voters , and fear of the @entity103 itself , which he neither fully understands nor has ever really been interested in , ’ it @entity109 claims his long - awaited speech on @entity98 was ‘ boring ’ and was ‘ an attempt to shake off a troublesome issue by postponing it to a later date ’			2
‘ he wants @entity98 to be a free trade zone with beach access			0
he missed an opportunity on wednesday to haul @entity3 back to the centre of @entity98			1
‘ apart from vague demands like competitiveness , flexibility and fairness , he has no idea how the @entity103 should develop			0
‘ his thinking on @entity98 is indecisive and chained to the present			0
' what @entity98 witnessed on wednesday was a speech delivered by a politician prone to knee - jerk reactions who lacks values or a vision			2
@entity2 floats above @entity98 like an astronaut			0
’ the @entity68 defended the idea of @entity143 forcing firms to pay more tax			2
’ i 'm a low - tax conservative , but i 'm not a companies - should - pay - no - tax @entity149			1
individuals and businesses must pay their fair share , ’ he said			0
‘ any businesses who think that they can carry on dodging that fair share or that they can keep on selling to the @entity3 and setting up ever - more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bill right down - well , they need to wake up and smell the coffee because the public who buy from them have had enough			1
’ poor business practices not only deprive the public sector of the revenue it needs to fund essential services , but also harm responsible firms , he said			0
‘ when one company does n't pay the taxes they owe , then other companies end up paying more , " said mr @entity2			2
‘ when some cowboys play the system , all businesses suffer the fall - out to their reputation			0
‘ that 's why it 's not just those in the @entity179 who have been lobbying my government on these issues , it 's those in the high - rises of the @entity185 - bankers , lawyers , senior figures in finance			0
‘ they 've told us to pursue this agenda hard , and that 's what we 're going to do			0
’ @entity194 , @entity195 chief executive , said : ' there can be no moral justification for companies wriggling out of paying their fair share to society			2
' but @entity202 , founder of @entity203 , said : ' unless there is a uniform tax regime with a uniform tax rate and uniform accounting policy globally , @entity2 is banging his head against a brick wall			2
' @entity211 general secretary @entity210 said global efforts to tackle avoidance need to be matched by ' tougher action ' domestically			1
' the tens of billions of pounds raised would be a fairer and more effective way to tackle budget deficits than endless self - defeating austerity , ' she added			0
@entity219 , @entity220 director - general , said : ' the majority of businesses pay the right amount of tax , and for the small minority which do not , times are getting tougher , and rightly so			0
' the @entity220 does not condone highly abusive avoidance schemes which serve no commercial purpose other than the minimisation of tax , even if they are legal			1
' in some cases the tax system is lagging behind commercial reality , particularly around the taxation of the digital economy and transfer pricing			0
as the prime minister highlights , the @entity3 needs to work together with other countries , including the @entity22 , to change the rules where appropriate , so that they are fit for the global business age			1
