by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 4 september 2012 updated : 10:46 est , 4 september 2012 watching @entity3 's latest fragrance advert , it is impossible to believe that @entity4 is nearing her half century			1
the 44 - year - old actress positively glows in the latest offering for the brand , for which she is an ambassador			1
directed by @entity9 director @entity8 , @entity4 glides through a crowded party as a bottle of @entity3 's latest fragrance , ' @entity15 ' , glimmers under the chandelier lights			1
a campaign she did for the brand last year was banned by the @entity23 , who deemed @entity25 , parent company of @entity3 , had used digitally retouched images that could ' mislead ' the viewer			1
@entity25 said at the time that image had been digitally re-touched to ‘ lighten the skin , clean up make - up , reduce dark shadows and shading around the eyes , smooth the lips and darken the eyebrows ’			0
however , again , it insisted that the image was an accurate reflection of the benefits of the product			0
the @entity23 was not convinced , ruling the images could not be used again in their current form			1
here though , it can not be denied that @entity4 is in possession of a striking natural beauty			2
dressed in a floor length white dress that reveals her ample cleavage , the star shines in her role			0
@entity4 emerges in a stunning floor - length white dress as she walks through a crowded party the @entity53 star 's hair is flowing in curls and she shows off her ample cleavage ' the only person that could embody this kind of joyful femininity , this woman that could be all women at the same time - in their honesty , truth and diversity - is @entity4 , ' @entity55 , president of @entity56 , told @entity67			1
the perfume itself is made of just 63 subtle ingredients and was the creation of three @entity20 masters of perfumery ; @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , who aimed to create ' the first ever feminine iris '			0
the perfume has fruity flavour notes of blackcurrant and pear , with tones of tonka bean , praline , patchouli and vanilla			0
the @entity53 actress told @entity87 that it 's important for her to wear a nice scent as it makes her feel more confident with herself			2
' i like to smell nice			0
and i think it is best when perfume is kind of there , but still draws people in			0
you have to get close to figure out what you 're dealing with			0
the @entity97 banned this @entity3 advert of actress @entity4 after complaints it was misleading ' the bottle is beautiful			1
and in this day and age when everything 's about the brand and everything 's got the name of the company and the person and the place stamped all over it , what i think is amazing is that there 's nothing written on the bottle , ' she said .			2

actress 's ad for @entity15 comes a year after @entity23 banned previous ad for ' misleading ' use of *airbrush*
