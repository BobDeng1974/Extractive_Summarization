by @entity0 published : 05:46 est , 25 july 2013 updated : 17:52 est , 25 july 2013 a schoolboy who tried to perform a magic trick he had seen on tv had to be saved by his sister after he choked on a coin			1
@entity6 had watched an illusionist put a penny in his mouth and then pull out two moments later and he wanted to do the same himself			1
but as he attempted to perform the stunt in front of his eight - year - old sister @entity13 the coin got stuck in his throat and blocked his airway			1
their mother and grandmother were both downstairs in the family home in @entity32 , @entity33 , completely unaware of the drama that was unfolding			0
despite @entity19 shaking as he struggled to breathe , she also attempted abdominal thrusts and kept her cool until the coin was dislodged			0
@entity13 was hailed as a lifesaver by the @entity38 today who had run first aid classes in her school			1
her mother @entity42 , 36 , said : ' i am so proud of my daughter			0
i had no idea that she had learned life saving skills in school , but i am so glad she did			0
' if she had n't been taught what to do , i 'd probably only have one child still with us			0
family delight : @entity18 ( centre with the coin ) thumped her brother @entity19 ( green t - shirt ) on the back to dislodge the coin			1
her mother @entity42 ( right ) , who is married to @entity59 ( left ) was downstairs and unaware what was going on happy siblings : @entity18 knew exactly what to do to help her brother as she had lifesaving classes in school from the @entity38 ' i would have completely panicked if i 'd been in the same situation as @entity13 was , but luckily , she kept her cool			1
' the siblings had been playing upstairs together when @entity19 slipped the penny into his mouth			2
and when @entity13 heard him spluttering , she knew what to do			2
mrs @entity18 , who runs a family housing business with her husband @entity59 , 36 , said : ' @entity13 said she turned round and @entity19 was twitching and his eyes had gone all bulgy and were watering			2
' she had a look in his mouth and could n't see anything , so she started slapping him on the back , then listening to see if he had started breathing again			1
' she tried shaking him , and jiggling him about - and after the back slaps , that was enough to dislodge the coin			1
' it came shooting out of his mouth and @entity13 said he took a huge breath and started crying - it was only then that she thought to call for me			1
' she said the only thing she had forgotten to do that she had been taught was shout for help			0
' @entity13 shouted for her mother , who came running up the stairs , where @entity19 said : ' @entity13 saved my life			1
' trick : @entity6 ( right ) had watched an illusionist put a penny in his mouth and pull out two - and wanted to show his sister @entity13 that he could do the same @entity13 had been taught the @entity38 's @entity98 course at @entity99 by her teacher @entity100 , who had recently taken part in @entity102			1
the eight - year old used the technique of back blocks between the shoulder blades of her brother to save his life - just like she had been taught at school			0
mrs @entity18 added : ' i ca n't thank the school enough for teaching my daughter these vital skills			0
' i hope that by talking about what happened , more schools will think seriously about teaching their children these skills that could save a life			0
' she was so impressed by her daughter 's quick - thinking after admitting she would n't have known what to do to help her son			0
@entity121 , chief executive at the @entity38 said : ' @entity13 was heroic in saving her brother 's life and she is a fantastic example of how learning emergency life skills can mean the difference between life and death			2
' sadly many people are n't lucky enough to have someone like @entity13 on - hand when their life is in danger , meaning lives are needlessly lost every year			2
' the @entity134 should pay attention to @entity13 's story and make @entity138 a compulsory part of the curriculum so every child leaves school with the skills to save a life			0
' i 'm sure @entity13 would say that emergency life support is the most important lesson she has ever learnt			0
