@entity0 is on course to break sir @entity3 's all - time goalscoring record at the club , but the @entity6 captain has struggled to find the net at the home of one their fiercest rivals			2
ahead of sunday 's crunch clash at @entity14 , @entity12 manager @entity11 will be hoping his star striker can lead by example when @entity6 travel to @entity18			1
