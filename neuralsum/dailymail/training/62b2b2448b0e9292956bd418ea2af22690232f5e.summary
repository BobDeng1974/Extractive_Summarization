by @entity0 last updated at 1:46 pm on 8th september 2011 with an audience of rock stars , actors and assorted trendsetters , a fusty oration about fiscal prudence was clearly not going to suffice			1
yet @entity7 still managed to raise more than a few eyebrows with a speech to mark his naming as @entity11 by the men ’s fashion bible , @entity14			1
the chancellor took a leaf out of his foul - mouthed near - namesake @entity18 ’s book with a reference to the solitary practices of adolescent boys			1
proud : @entity7 with his @entity11 award and journalist @entity23			1
the chancellor let slip a swear word during his acceptance speech mr @entity7 , at 40 the youngest chancellor for 120 years , started with a touch of self - deprecation as he faced the crowd at the @entity31			1
‘ i ’ve just come from addressing about 300 bankers in the @entity33 and it says something about my profession that i was still the most unpopular person in the room , ’ he said			1
‘ it is a fine recognition			2
i wo n’t reveal your secret past as chairman of the @entity43 about twenty years ago			2
' it is a pleasure to win this award			1
i ’ve just come from addressing about 300 bankers in the @entity33 and it says something about my profession that i was still the most unpopular person in the room			2
' it is a fine recognition			2
of course , we pay close attention to what @entity23 [ @entity51 ] brilliantly reports on the 10 o’clock news , and what ’s written in the pages of the @entity56			2
' i ’m not sure who actually reads the politics pages of @entity14 though , @entity59 – i suspect they are the only pages of the magazine that a teenage boy has n’t stuck together in reading the magazine			2
' some might say that ’s because the w * * * * * * are on the page rather than reading them			0
thank you very much for the award			1
' in a reference to a fellow guest , @entity71 political editor @entity23 , he added : ‘ of course , we pay close attention to what @entity23 brilliantly reports on the 10 o’clock news , and what ’s written in the pages of the @entity56			0
‘ i ’m not sure who actually reads the politics pages of @entity14 though			0
i suspect they are the only pages of the magazine that a teenage boy has n’t stuck together in reading the magazine			0
‘ some might say that ’s because the w * * * ers are on the page rather than reading them			0
’ his words provoked groans among the audience , which included @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
a clearly surprised @entity98 , who took to the stage next to hand a gong to his old friend @entity101 , told the chancellor : ‘ what were you thinking ? are you aware the magazine has male models ? were you thinking of @entity107 ? ’ mr @entity7 left soon after winning the award			1
a colleague said : ‘ this was supposed to be an off - the - cuff and self - deprecating joke at the expense of politicians , and was certainly not meant to cause offence			0
’ @entity117 mayor @entity116 failed to raise the tone of the occasion when he went on to tell the audience how he was frequently described as a ‘ @entity122 t * * * er ’			1
before handing the man of @entity125 award to @entity127 supremo lord @entity126 , he said : ‘ i ’ve been pounding the streets of @entity129 , i ’ve been hailed as i usually am with friendly shouts of , “ you @entity122 t * * * er ”			1
‘ i want you to know that i bring a message from @entity129 , from all the businesses i ’ve seen who are getting back on their feet , and that is that nothing and no one on earth is going to stop us preparing the greatest city on earth for the greatest @entity127 that have ever been held			0
’ pint - sized pop stars : @entity95 cosied up to @entity145 after he won the @entity147 award two years ago as @entity149 , @entity148 was forced to apologise for using the slang word ‘ tw * t ’ on a radio show			1
in a reference to the social networking website @entity154 , mr @entity148 had quipped : ‘ the trouble with @entity154 , the instantness of it – too many twits might make a tw * t. he compounded the slip - up when he said people were “ p * * * * * off – sorry , i ca n’t say that in the morning – angry with politicians ’			0
while mr @entity148 ’s aides pointed out that tw * t is not a swearword under radio guidelines and said he had apologised immediately for his latter comment , he later expressed contrition for his use of bad language			0
‘ you always have to be careful what you say , ’ he said			0
‘ if i ’ve caused any offence i obviously regret that			0
