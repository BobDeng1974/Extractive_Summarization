by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 when @entity2 chooses the man to fill @entity5 ’s golden boots in @entity6 on tuesday , he knows it is a decision that could shape @entity10 ’s @entity9 destiny			1
no - one can properly replace @entity5			2
@entity2 is aware of that and so are his players			2
from the moment the mercurial star was carried off with a fractured vertebrae in @entity20 on friday , the victim of a crude @entity16 knee in the back , the host nation feared that their dreams may have disappeared with him			2
@entity10 have no choice but to try and pick themselves up for tuesday ’s @entity9 semi-final against @entity25 at the @entity26 , while @entity2 must pick the right man to take @entity5 ’s place			1
it ’s a huge call			0
crocked : @entity5 lies motionless on the turf after breaking a vertebrae against @entity32 decision time : ' @entity34 must choose between @entity35 and @entity36 to replace his @entity37 the task is likely to fall to one of two players			1
in the diminutive @entity36 , @entity2 has the nearest like - for - like replacement for @entity5 ; a nimble , tricky forward capable of producing a piece of magic that could stop the @entity45 machine in its tracks			1
in @entity48 ’s @entity35 , the @entity10 coach possesses a more reliable option and one he seems more likely to take			1
whichever choice @entity2 makes will offer an insight into his thinking			2
take the game to @entity25 or dig in			2
without @entity5 to light up a rather ordinary @entity10 team , you suspect he will go for the latter			1
@entity35 is a conscientious and disciplined midfielder who has shown during his first season under @entity58 at @entity48 that he is prepared to sacrifice himself for the greater good of the team			2
he will keep possession , make his tackles and track back to protect his defence – all qualities that will be sorely needed against a ruthless @entity45 side			0
in short , he has more to offer than @entity36 though without that spark of genius			2
functional : @entity35 is known for his willingness to track back and defend from wide he also has a good understanding with his @entity48 team - mate @entity72 , who could occupy @entity5 ’s withdrawn role and interchange with @entity35 who usually starts on the right - hand side			1
‘ we played a lot together last season at @entity48 , ’ said @entity35			2
‘ we were free to move around and we are very familiar with each other ’s games			0
if @entity2 does choose me , it wo n’t be a problem for us because we have had a year of playing together			1
’ for the 25 - year - old , the return to @entity6 represents an opportunity he feared may have disappeared when he missed a penalty in the shootout there against @entity90 after coming on as a substitute in extra-time			0
@entity35 ’s other two appearances in the tournament have been off the bench against @entity96 and @entity97 , replacing @entity5 on the second occasion			1
however he insists that it is pointless drawing comparisons			0
creative spark : @entity36 has the potential to be a match winner for @entity10 ‘ there ’s no comparing us			1
yes , some things are similar , such as our speed and dribbling , but @entity5 is a striker whereas i am more a midfielder who sets up others			0
@entity5 scores a lot of goals , whereas i am more someone who serves my team - mates			0
‘ @entity5 sets the standard for us			0
he is capable of deciding any game , so playing without him will be difficult			0
’ for the man who replaced @entity35 at @entity120 last summer , a semi-final appearance would be even more emotional			2
@entity36 was born and raised in @entity6 and played for @entity121 until his £ 21.5million move to @entity123			0
the local hero will become a national icon if he can help steer @entity10 into the @entity9 final			1
at 5ft 5in , you fear that @entity36 is in danger of being crushed by his @entity45 opponents			0
he offers none of the efficiency , defensive solidity or tactical reliability of @entity35			0
key role : @entity48 midfielders @entity72 ( left ) is likely to be moved central in @entity5 's absence yet the man described by @entity2 as having ‘ joy in his legs ’ might also be @entity10 ’s ace in the pack ; a player capable of producing a moment of magic , something out of nothing , just like the talisman they have lost to injury			1
the question is , can @entity10 afford to gamble ? so far the 21 - year - old ’s contribution has been limited – a half - time substitute against @entity96 and a second - half appearance off the bench against @entity154 – but he is ready if needed			0
‘ we have to be prepared , ’ said @entity36			0
‘ we are all very sad ( about @entity5 ) but we have to overcome it			0
this is a @entity9 semi-final and the players have to be prepared , psychologically and emotionally			1
we have lots of other good players and we can still beat @entity25 and be the champions			0
’ to do so , @entity10 will have to raise their game another level without @entity5			1
@entity35 or @entity36 must fill those golden boots , and now it ’s down to @entity2 to decide			1
for @entity34 , it ’s a hell of a big call			0
battle : @entity35 and @entity36 challenge each other in training earlier in the tournament			1

@entity10 star @entity5 out of @entity9 with broken vertebrae
@entity10 take on @entity25 in @entity9 semi-final on tuesday night
manager @entity2 must choose between @entity36 and @entity35
