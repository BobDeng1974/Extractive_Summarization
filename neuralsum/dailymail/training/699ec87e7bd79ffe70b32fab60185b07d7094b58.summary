@entity0 risked the wrath of the @entity2 after claiming the ‘ campaign ’ against his side is still going on and could cost @entity3 the @entity5 title			1
@entity0 was incensed after being held 1 - 1 at home by @entity9 on saturday , claiming a string of decisions by referee @entity12 cost his side dearly , with @entity3 midfielder @entity14 set to miss next sunday ’s @entity16 final against @entity17 after being sent off after 69 minutes			1
@entity0 felt @entity18 should have been sent off for the challenge that prompted @entity14 to retaliate by pushing the @entity9 striker over , and should also have seen red for an earlier push on @entity22			1
and @entity0 ’s sense of injustice was not helped by two penalty claims that were ignored , when @entity26 handled an @entity22 shot in the 33rd minute , and then when @entity9 skipper @entity28 pushed @entity29 to the ground shortly before half - time			1
@entity0 ( centre ) refused to comment on @entity34 's red card against @entity9 but says four incidents were crucial @entity3 's boss identified the minutes 30 , 33 , 43 and 69 and thinks they ' wrote the story of the game ' in his post-match interview last month , @entity0 was fined £ 25,000 and warned about his future conduct after speaking in december about a ‘ campaign ’ against @entity3 , and was further incensed when @entity29 received a three - match ban for stamping on @entity44 ’s @entity45 soon afterwards			1
so he chose his words carefully and spoke cryptically about the incidents , outlining the minute that each perceived injustice happened rather than describing them or the players involved in detail			2
he told @entity52 : ' i think there are four moments of the game where you can write the story of the game			0
minute 30 , minute 33 , minute 43 and minute @entity60 repeat for you , i make it easy for you			2
minute 30 , 33 , 43 and 69			2
the game had four moments and do n't ask me more questions because i do n't answer			0
' in a separate interview with @entity67 , @entity0 carried on refusing to comment on the match			2
' i just say that i believe in spite of some clear callers you guys are all honest people and professional people and i believe that sometimes the callers they can disturb a little bit the truth			0
but i truly believe that you are all honest people			0
' the tackle infuriated @entity34 and @entity0 but @entity18 got away unpunished despite how high his studs are up the @entity81 's leg ' after these four moments i am surprised that we did n't lose all three points			1
' i am in no mood to laugh			0
' the incidents in question are thought to be involve @entity18 ' tackles and two penalty appeals which were turned down			1
the main talking point will be @entity14 's straight red card after 69 minutes			1
the @entity81 midfielder pushed @entity18 to the floor which saw him receive the red card after the striker 's horror tackle @entity14 reacts angrily after @entity18 's terrible challenge on him could have seriously injured him but he 'll now miss the @entity16 final 30 - @entity18 sends @entity22 crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back			1
@entity22 rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken			0
verdict : should have been a free - kick and could have been a yellow card for @entity18			2
the @entity9 forward clatters into the @entity81 defender which infuriated the @entity3 players during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity110 33 - @entity22 fires a shot at goal but @entity26 diverts it with an outstretched arm , as he turns his back to goal			1
verdict : should have been a @entity3 penalty			2
@entity22 fires at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of @entity26 but no penalty was awarded 43 - @entity29 tumbles to the ground after @entity9 captain @entity28 leans into him with an oustretched arm			1
verdict : could have been a @entity3 penalty but would have been very soft			2
@entity29 vents his frustration on the ground after his appeal for a penalty was turned down by the referee following @entity28 's push 69 - @entity18 misses the ball and almost snaps @entity14 's left shin with his studs but @entity12 waves play on			1
an enraged @entity34 leaps up and pushes @entity18 over violently			0
@entity12 sends off @entity14 and books @entity22 for trying to take red card out of his hand			1
verdict : shocking tackle merited a red card for @entity18 and a @entity3 free - kick			1
the @entity81 midfielder was led away by his teammates as @entity12 shows him a red card for his push on @entity18 the @entity81 midfielder was caught by a nasty challenge from the @entity9 forward and reacted angrily by pushing him to the floor in front of the referee			1
when asked about the sending off the @entity3 boss simply responded			1
‘ that was the minute 69 and it had a big relation with minute 30 , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ normally the player , if i can call him a player , was involved in minute 30 and normally by minute 31 he should be in the shower			0
no minute 69 if the person in charge does the things in the proper way in minute 30			0
’ when pushed on the matter the usually fiery @entity0 simply refused to comment			0
he said : ' i ca n't do that because i 'm punished when i refer to these situations			0
i do n't want to be punished			0
@entity0 was clearly keen on avoiding another hefty fine after being fined £ 25,000 for comments claiming that there was a ' campaign to influence referees			2
' the @entity3 boss made the comment after his side were denied a penalty after @entity172 was adjudged to have dived in the box in the 1 - 1 draw with @entity175 on 28 december			1
he told @entity67 : ' the media , commentators , other managers are all doing it [ putting pressure on referees ]			0
' ' there is a campaign against @entity3			0
i do n't know why there is this campaign and i do not care			0
' everybody knows it was a penalty			0
' @entity29 looks bemused after @entity12 refused to award him a penalty after a tussle with @entity28 in the penalty box @entity18 was also involved in another incident after catching goalscorer @entity22 in the back with a high foot - which happened in one of the minutes @entity0 mentioned			1
the other minutes in questions are believed to be about the two penalty appeals @entity3 had waved away			1
on 33 minutes , @entity22 's shot struck @entity26 on the arm but @entity12 said no. @entity22 screams in pain after being fouled by @entity18 in the first half - which was an incident @entity0 mentioned then just before half - time , @entity29 was pushed over in the box by @entity28 but once again the referee refused to give it - much to the bemusement of the home side			1
when asked again @entity0 continued to keep his mouth closed			0
' i do n't describe			0
to describe i have to use words that i can not use			0
it 's better we finish here			0
' you do want you want to do , you speak what you want to speak			0
you are not punished by that - i am			0
' i do n't want to look silly in front of you but i have to repeat 30,33 , 43 and 69			0
i have nothing more to say			0
' @entity220 equalises for @entity9 , climing above @entity221 at the far post to head past the @entity3 defence - not long after @entity14 's sending off 30 - @entity3 's website highlighted the decisions @entity0 was talking about and clearly thought @entity18 fouled @entity22			1
33 - not holding back , they were convinced @entity26 handled the ball in the box following the @entity81 's shot at goal and appear to feel hard done by			2
43 - ' @entity230 ' seems to be their thoughts on the penalty decisions and feel that @entity29 was ' pushed to the ground ' but the referee did n't seem agree			1
69 - a very angry @entity3 state that @entity18 ' tackle was ' potentially leg - breaking , ' which does n't seem to be far off the mark			1
@entity3 were frank about how they thought the decisions should have gone and did n't hold back on the @entity238 tackle			2

@entity0 carefully chose his comments on @entity14 's sending off for reacting to @entity18 ' tackle
the @entity3 boss identified minutes 30 , 33 , 43 and 69 as ' crucial ' and says they *changed* the game
@entity18 was also involved in another incident earlier in the game when he caught @entity22 with his knee
@entity22 and @entity29 both had solid penalty appeals turned down by referee @entity12
the @entity81 defender had given @entity3 the lead in the first half after good work from @entity255
