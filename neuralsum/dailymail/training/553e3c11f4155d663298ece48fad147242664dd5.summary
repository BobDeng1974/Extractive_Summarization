by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 19:14 est , 27 january 2014 a @entity3 man who was sentenced to nine months prison stemming from a marijuana possession charge has been given permission by the sentencing judge to leave jail for 10 days each month to go to @entity9 ... to smoke marijuana			1
@entity11 , 49 , is a marijuana activist and cancer patient who has been legally cleared to receive marijuana for medical reasons in @entity17			1
despite the fact that @entity3 has since passed laws legalizing medical marijuana , he still has to leave @entity21 and travel to @entity17 to receive his cannabis			1
bad fortune : @entity11 is serving a staggered sentence of 270 days in 20 - day intervals with 10 days off in between to travel to @entity17 for cancer treatment - which includes medical marijuana @entity29 , whose multiple attempts to legally change his name to @entity33 have so far been unsuccessful , has been in and out of prison over the past two decades for his dedication to the cannabis cause			1
his latest imprisonment , he says , is ' punishment for being outspoken , and right			0
' he is suffering from a rare bone cancer that causes him to experience painful giant cell tumors and cancerous lesions			0
every month , @entity29 is permitted to fly to @entity17 for bone cancer treatment , which includes access to medical marijuana which helps with his pain and has also been shown to shrink and slow the growth of his tumors			1
advocate : @entity29 has been a marijuana activist for 20 years , pushing for legalization in the @entity56 , and particular his home state @entity3 , where medical marijuana was recently legalized personal politics : @entity11 , @entity33 , says he 's being punished for ' being outspoken , and being right ' ' i ’m clearly a marijuana patient			1
the judge will let me out to go to @entity17 , knowing i ’m going to get marijuana as soon as i walk out the door , ' @entity11 told @entity65 in november			2
' i go to @entity17 , where i ’m treated like a patient for a few days , then i have to turn around and go back to prison			0
' although @entity3 's third medical marijuana facility opened in @entity69 in december , @entity11 says that ' it still takes a year for a patient to actually get his card and then get on the list			1
' ' there are patients who have had their card for over a year now who still do n’t have access to medical marijuana from the programs that are already open , ' he told @entity80			2
in a december press conference , governor @entity81 told reporters that he is ' not open to ' a bill allowing registered medical marijuana patients in @entity3 to purchase cannabis in a state where it 's been legalized and bring it back to @entity3			1
@entity11 , who has been vocal in his opposition to @entity3 mayor @entity81 , has himself had a tilt at public office more than once , running for @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity94 on legalization platforms			2
most recently , he has been running his ' @entity96 to governor @entity81 ' campaign from prison			1
devout : the practicing @entity99 built this temple to cannabis in @entity102 , where he spent years in self - imposed ' political refuge ' ' governor @entity81 made a political point to be opposed to the marijuana laws and cannabis laws and just taking a cue from the " @entity96 " campaign i figured i would put out the ads nationally to oppose governor @entity81 ’s campaign for presidency , ' @entity11 told @entity80			1
in early november he requested that governor @entity81 waive his jail term in light of his illness			2
he has been unable to receive proper care , he says , as treatment often needs to take place outside of the 10 allocated days			0
in addition , he says , it 's impossible for him to afford flights to @entity17 when he 's unable to work or raise money			0
' i ’m going back to @entity21 , ' @entity11 told the @entity124 over the phone recently , from a @entity127 bus stop			0
i just sit there in jail with a whole bunch of people who are wasting their lives			0
that ’s the number one thing			0
and it does n’t do one thing			0
what am i being corrected on ? the state already legalized medical marijuana			2
i ’m a medical marijuana patient			0
this is punishment for being outspoken and right			0

@entity11 , 49 , was arrested for marijuana possession in 2010 then jailed for *violating* *probation* last year
he is serving a staggered 270 - day sentence which he serves in 20 - day *installments* at a @entity3 prison
the 10 days in between jail stints he travels to @entity17 to smoke medical marijuana and receive treatment for cancer
medical marijuana is legalized in @entity3 but the governor has refused to waive @entity29 's sentence
the *longtime* cannabis activist is also a *perennial* political *candidate* in his state
he has recently *launched* a ' @entity96 to governor @entity81 ' campaign in *response* to the latter 's *reluctance* to legalize cannabis
