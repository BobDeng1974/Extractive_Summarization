a @entity1 woman has proved that a car on a hot summer ’s day really can be hot enough to fry an egg			1
actress @entity5 incredibly baked cookies , eggs , pasta and grilled cheese successfully on the dashboard of her car on a hot day with frightening results			1
the ' car cooking ' series has a very important message , indicating that when a child or pet are left in a car on a hot day they are essentially being put in an oven			1
‘ the message is clear : do n’t cook your pet , ’ ms @entity5 told @entity21			1
‘ it started as a bit of fun but when the food started cooking so well and really quickly i thought “ can you imagine a kid or a dog in the car ? ” it ’s nuts to me			1
’ ‘ it ’s so important for people to realise what happens inside a hot car			1
maybe people do n’t know and there ’s a level of ignorance about just how hot a car becomes			1
leaving the window down a few centimetres does little the smaller the child or animal , the greater the risk			2
a young child will quickly dehydrate , lapse into unconsciousness and may never fully recover			0
the cause is particularly close to the 29 - year - old ’s heart as she owns a beautiful two - year - old pug named @entity55 and is often startled when she sees dogs left in cars with the window ajar			0
ms @entity5 first started by putting a tray of dough on the dashboard , curious about the results			2
she was amazed when she had well - cooked cookies in just an hour and a half			1
‘ the cookies made my car smell amazing so i thought “ maybe i should do this more often , ” ’ ms @entity5 laughed			1
the same could not be said for the egg and grilled cheese experiments			1
‘ i had to air my car out after that and was scared i ’d develop an ant problem so i think i ’m done with car cooking for a little while , ’ she said			0
however an interesting result was the awful taste of the food cooked by sunlight			2
‘ i ate the cookies but i learned quickly not to eat the car food			1
i did n’t feel very good afterwards ! ‘ i definitely would n’t promote it as an alternative method to cooking			0
more just as a demonstration , ' she joked			0
the experiment started as a joke to prove how hot her car became in the @entity1 sun in just fifteen minutes the chocolate was able to melt and become fondue on the first day of autumn ms @entity5 quickly realised that the car was effectively an oven on a hot day			1
she decided the images could become a powerful way to send an message about the danger of leaving children and pets alone in hot cars the @entity123 - trained actress also quickly learnt the importance of putting down a tea towel when the tray left a melted mark on her dash			1
‘ i had to use oven mitts because the pans got that hot , ’ she said			2
in february a 22 - month - old boy died when he was left inside a hot vehicle parked on the driveway of a @entity135 daycare centre in @entity136			2
ambulance @entity136 would not comment on the case , but had issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars			0
in the first five weeks of 2015 paramedics were called to 200 cases of children overheating in cars			0
the website series has quickly gained interest and ms @entity5 was even able to prove that it really can be hot enough to fry an egg in a hot car ms @entity5 could n't believe that the egg had cooked so well that it was brown when she flipped it ms @entity5 ca n't believe that some people are thoughtless enough to leave their pets alone in cars with the window cracked open advanced life support paramedic @entity155 said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in @entity136 and says it 's frustrating the message is n't getting through			1
' children ca n't regulate their body temperature like adults can , which puts them at significant risk , ' he told @entity21			0
' it 's never okay to leave a child locked in a car , even for a minute or two			2
' the @entity136 state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars , with fines up to $ 3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months			2
ms @entity5 argues that it is never okay to leave a child or animal unattended , even during the cooler months of the year			1
' a typical @entity177 summer day that we ’ve all experienced is sitting in the car and burning yourself with the seatbelt buckle			2
' ‘ but what ’s scary is that some of the car cooking days in @entity1 were n't even sunny days , it was just hot			1
’ ms @entity5 herself has a beautiful two - year - old pug named @entity55 ms @entity5 was able to grill cheese on the dashboard of a car , but learned to put down a tea towel after the tray left a ' melted ' mark on her car ms @entity5 could n't believe how quickly and thoroughly the cheese melted and the bread became toasted ms @entity5 was also able to cook the eggs and fondue on an autumn day in @entity199 , proving that there is a danger of a stuffy car quickly becoming overheated on seemingly cool days			1
within just 15 minutes she had melted chocolate for fondue			0
the egg took around an hour , but when @entity5 flipped the egg she was amazed to find it had already become brown			1
the spaghetti was the most astonishing result			0
the 29 - year - old left a pot of cold water and hard spaghetti strands in the car			2
by morning she had uninviting but nonetheless cooked pasta			2
she has quickly gained a following as well as a range of interesting remarks from friends			0
‘ you ’re not living in your car , are you ? ’ asked a friend			0
‘ and a car gets you from a to @entity224 so versatile ! ’ another person mused			0
‘ get a stove already , ’ another quipped			0
‘ i do n’t understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person , like part of the family , ' she said her car cooking has been referred to as ‘ meals - in - wheels ’ and her ‘ solar oven			1
’ ‘ how good ! go to work , finish and get in your car with your meal cooked already ! winning ! ’ remarked another friend			2
however , the realisation that a vehicle can become so intensely hot so quickly is also startling			0
‘ i still see animals in cars with a cracked window and it baffles me that it still happens in this day and age when there ’s enough literature and information about not doing that sort of thing			0
’ ‘ i do n’t understand how people could have a dog and not treat it like a person , like part of the family			0
‘ there are no government funded ads to explain what actually happens when children and pets are left in hot cars			0
‘ it ’s tragic when children die in the back of cars			0
people need to be aware , it needs to be at the forefront of people ’s minds			0
the first experiment was with cookie dough and was a massive success when they baked in just over an hour ms @entity5 was also impressed when her car smelt delicious thanks to the aroma of baked goods ‘ i think these images are powerful because they make an impact without being grotesque or in poor taste			1
’ the photos , initially intended as a joke , have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car			1
‘ i think it ’s a really good demonstration of what not to do with your children or your pets , ’ said ms @entity5			0
‘ if it helps raise any kind of awareness it ’s taken an activity that i did with too much time on my hands and turned it into something quite helpful			0
’ the hilarious photos , initially intended as a joke , have taken on a life of their own as a way of raising awareness about the reality of a hot car			1
