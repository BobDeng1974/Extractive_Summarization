@entity1 mp @entity0 claimed @entity3 men were fundamentally sexist towards women a @entity1 mp has sparked controversy after claiming ‘ gangs of @entity3 men are going round and raping white kids at this moment in time ’			1
@entity0 , mp for @entity12 , said the extraordinary claim was a ‘ fact ’ and urged government agencies to tackle the problem			1
but he has been criticised by @entity3 leaders in his constituency , who said he overstepped the mark during a @entity21 debate			1
mr @entity0 , a former leader of @entity22 , also claimed @entity3 men were ‘ fundamentally ’ sexist towards women , and politicians had to challenge behaviour and culture			1
speaking in a parliamentary debate on child sexual exploitation , mr @entity0 claimed mainstream parties had failed by not speaking out about the racial and cultural aspect to some abuse cases and extremists groups had filled the vacuum			2
he told @entity35 : ‘ the @entity36 will use grooming as a key element of its campaign in the @entity41 election campaign , which will start soon			0
‘ not all @entity44 @entity43 men are abusing white kids			2
there is a minority , though			0
the media coverage gives long lists of notorious abusers - including vicars , priests and celebrities - who are all white and @entity54			0
’ the ‘ vast majority ’ of child abusers in this country are white , he added			0
‘ but we should not get away from the fact that gangs of @entity3 men are going round and raping white kids at this moment in time			1
‘ that is an horrendous thing to say , but it is the fact of what is happening			0
i want to explore some of the state ’s agencies ’ behaviour towards that , and some of the community ’s associated behaviour and culture			2
’ mr @entity0 conceded that his friends in the @entity21 and ‘ back home ’ would not like what he was saying , but he felt it had to be said			1
‘ fundamentally , there is a sexist behaviour by @entity3 men towards women , ’ he said			1
‘ we talk about institutions and commissions and all the rest of it			0
fundamentally , as leaders , we need to challenge the behaviour that is going on			2
‘ we need to do that from a point , though , of not being racist			0
we are friends who want those people to be successful in our society			0
they are part of @entity44 society , but there is behaviour that is unacceptable			0
’ @entity97 said mr @entity0 had overstepped the mark			1
a spokesman said : ‘ all of us , @entity3 or @entity54 , are equally appalled by the activities of criminals amidst our society			1
‘ to suggest that the @entity3 community does not care is grossly libellous			1
@entity0 is right to draw the attention to the activities of the criminals and the plight of the victims but he has overstepped his remit , ’ he told the @entity102			0
‘ he has the right to be angry but , equally , a man of his position should be more discerning in what he says and how he says it			0
he should not overlook the fact that he went around pleading for votes from the same @entity3 faith institutions that he so arrogantly dismissive of			2

@entity12 mp uses @entity21 debate to demand government agencies do more to tackle the problem
he also suggests @entity3 men are ' fundamentally ' sexist towards women
@entity97 say he has *over-stepped* the mark
