gay marriage is set to be allowed in churches and other religious buildings , it emerged friday.the @entity4 will reveal plans next week to allow faith groups in @entity7 and @entity8 to ' opt in ' if they want to host same - sex weddings			1
the move is a dramatic extension of the @entity13 ’s plans to allow same - sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies			1
the proposal to legalise gay marriage has been fiercely opposed by some senior church figures and scores of @entity20 mps			1
prime minister @entity21 insisted churches would not be forced to hold gay weddings , while on a visit to @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 but that has n’t stopped @entity21 from supporting it			1
mps will have a free vote on a @entity32 next year			2
the @entity21 , speaking on a visit to @entity26 , @entity27 , friday , said : ' look , i ’m in favour of gay marriage because i ’m a massive supporter of marriage and i do n’t want gay people to be excluded from a great institution			1
' but let me be absolutely 100 per cent clear : if there is any church or any synagogue or any mosque that does n’t want to have a gay marriage , it will not – it absolutely must not – be forced to hold it			1
' that is absolutely clear in the legislation			0
and also let me make clear : this is a free vote for members of @entity50 , but personally i will be supporting it			0
' the dramatic move has prompted immediate controversy			2
anti-reform campaigners said that whatever was intended by the legislation , its introduction would only increase pressure on churches opposed to same - sex ceremonies to perform them			1
the pm has said that religious groups can choose whether to host same - sex weddings the prime minister took to @entity64 to insist religious groups will not be forced to perform gay marriages and conservatives will not be whipped in the vote next year some @entity68 said the move would ' outrage millions '			1
labour leader @entity71 has been pushing the government to extend their plans to allow those religious groups which want to offer gay weddings to do so , as well as civil venues			1
@entity76 is also understood to have been pushing behind the scenes for the legislation , expected to be published in the @entity79 , to be widened in scope			0
mr @entity76 said : ' i ’m a supporter and always have been of same - sex marriage , because i think marriage is a wonderful thing , a wonderful institution			2
' it ’s very important to remember that in our plans we ’re not going to force any church or any religious denomination to hold same - sex marriage ceremonies if they do n’t want to			1
' the government has received 228,000 responses to its consultation on allowing gay civil marriage – more than on any other issue			2
culture secretary @entity97 will set out the plans next week , promising legal ' locks ' to protect churches opposed to the idea of gay marriage deputy prime minister @entity76 insisted the government would not force force any church to hold same sex marriage ceremonies if they do not want to culture secretary @entity97 is expected to respond to the consultation by setting out the government ’s plans in detail next week			1
sources said the unexpected move was necessary to make a promised protection from legal challenge for religious organisations which oppose gay marriage watertight			1
government legal advisers claimed that the opt - in clause was necessary to prevent the @entity119 courts over-ruling any clause in the @entity32 to protect those who object			0
but critics are sceptical that this will make any difference			0
civil partnerships , introduced in 2005 , already give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples			2
but the government wants them to be legally allowed to make marriage vows			2
ministers have vowed to protect churches and other religious groups who object , insisting that the legislation will be framed in a way to address claims from opponents that they might be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies once civil weddings are allowed because of human rights laws			1
last month it emerged that 118 out of 303 @entity20 mps had written to constituents indicating differing degrees of unease at the policy			1
last night another seven joined their ranks			0
@entity151 , the business minister , told the @entity13 campaign group he was ' strongly minded ' to oppose it and his constituents were ' overwhelmingly against ' changing the law			2
several other ministers are among those expected to abstain or vote against in a free vote			0
@entity159 , of the @entity13 , said : ' the decision to press ahead with the profoundly undemocratic proposals to rewrite the traditional meaning of marriage is deeply disappointing and regrettable			2
' the @entity21 has gone back on his promises that churches will be protected			0
the suggestion that by creating an " opt in system " you somehow prevent churches , mosques and synagogues being sued is risible			0
this is now made much more likely			0
' any legislation that the @entity21 proposes will be subject to the @entity119 courts , who according to legal experts will find against the government and those religious institutions who end up in the dock			0
so the pm is writing a cheque that he knows will bounce			0
' former archbishop of @entity183 added : ' i ’m dismayed that the government is seeking to fast - track this legislation			0
' first we had a consultation that was nothing of the kind and now we have this further attempt to expedite the legislation for short - term party political advantage			0
' we should expect politicians to act with greater wisdom and statesmanship when contemplating such far - reaching cultural and social changes			0
