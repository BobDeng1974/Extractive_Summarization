by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 may have played only two of @entity5 's last eight games - but he says he never doubted his status as the nation 's best right back			1
@entity2 was always confident of wearing the no 2 shirt in @entity9 , even when his form was blighted by fitness issues and @entity13 's @entity12 took possession of the role in the @entity17 qualifiers			1
' i 've played every game i 've been fit for in the last four or five years , ' said the 29 - year - old @entity21 defender			1
' there was never a point when i thought i was n't going to be in the squad			0
i do n't think i 've ever not been @entity5 's first choice			1
@entity33 also admitted the right back 's ' speed and fluency ' had been affected by his determination to play on for the team with ' a real bad ankle '			1
@entity2 said : ' i was playing for two or three months with two or three injuries but they were never serious			1
with all three of them playing a part though , it was affecting how i played and my ability to run			0
' we called a time - out and said i 've got to get fit , get it sorted , but it was only ever going to be a few weeks , not a season - ending type of injury			2
i was never worried that much			0
' those injuries i 'm over now and i guess it 's a privilege to say you 're the only natural right back in the squad			2
but @entity57 knows he 's got two or three who can cover the slot			2
i 'm sure over the course of a tournament , everybody will be needed			0
' helping hand : @entity5 skipper @entity64 will need his senior players to aid him out in @entity9 next month fighting to be fit : @entity66 is expected to be fit for the @entity17 meanwhile , @entity2 has confirmed that @entity66 has been in contact to say he expects to be fit to play against @entity5 in @entity9			1
' he thinks he 'll be fit , ' said @entity2 , who confessed to mixed feelings when he learned his @entity21 team - mate was winning his race to recover from a knee injury in time to lead the line for @entity73 in the @entity17 finals			1
need coaching through : @entity75 is going to his first major tournament and will be looked after ' he does n't seem to think it 's too bad			0
we 've been talking by text			0
you do n't want to see your mates injured but if he were to miss our game and be fit for the next one ! ' he 's clearly not one you 'd want to play against in the @entity17 , but i 'd rather he be fit than injured			2
it 's his dream to play in a @entity17 and after the season he 's had , he would be heartbroken not to be there			0
' players boasting 50 or more caps , along with @entity64 , @entity91 and @entity28 .			0
