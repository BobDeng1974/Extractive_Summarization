@entity11 spent a little over a week in the camp before being released following a public outcry			2
upsetting : a mother sent to a labour camp after she demanded justice for her daughter who had been raped has today had a compensation claim dismissed by a @entity7 court			1

the outrage about @entity11 's case has coincided with a government pledge to reform the labour - camp system by the end of the year			1
in the camp of more than 100 women , @entity11 said she had to memorise two pages of phrases that included : ' transform ourselves in a proper way ' and ' we 're not allowed to escape '			2
