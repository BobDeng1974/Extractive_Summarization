by @entity0 the next time you have to cram on to a train with a heavy suitcase , or catch a crowded bus carrying shopping , spare a thought for this man who cycled across @entity8 with a goat on his back			1

the short 30 - second clip has gone viral this afternoon , attracting more than 20,000 views since it was posted yesterday			1
since being posted the clip has gone viral , attracting more than 20,000 views in just a few hours @entity49 : remarkably , neither the man nor the goat appear any way ill at ease the man 's unusual method of transporting his cattle is perhaps not so strange in light of the fact that the majority of @entity16 are desperately poor as a result of a tumultuous @entity61 of droughts , famine and war			1

according to the @entity75 , the nation 's gross national income per capita is just Â£ 221 , although in recent years it has become one of fastest growing non-oil economies in @entity78 .			0
