@entity1 winger @entity0 has been ordered by manager @entity2 to take @entity4 lessons – despite having lived here for eight years			1
@entity6 is determined his current squad , which includes a number of native spanish - speakers , should all become fluent in @entity4 to help communication on the training ground and the pitch			2
newcomers @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have all had twice - weekly lessons arranged for them alongside goalkeeper @entity18 , who is in his fourth season at the club , and @entity0 , who first arrived in the @entity21 to play for @entity22 in 2006 before signing for @entity1 three seasons later			1
it is expected that @entity15 , who spoke broken @entity4 at his formal press conference unveiling on thursday , and @entity16 will be promoted to join @entity18 in intermediate classes over the coming weeks			1
@entity0 has asked for one - to - one tuition			0
it is ironic that @entity41 @entity6 is taking a tougher attitude over @entity1 players adapting to life in @entity26 than either of his @entity47 predecessors sir @entity48 and @entity49			2
@entity2 ( right ) wants his @entity29 speaking players , such as @entity15 , to speak @entity4 @entity27 's @entity4 is judged good enough to not need lessons but @entity13 ( right ) will have lessons @entity0 is by nature a shy person and has never conducted an interview in @entity4 despite coming to the country at the age of 20			1
he has played 282 times for @entity22 and @entity1			0
@entity29 international @entity27 , who joined @entity60 in the same 2011 summer transfer window as @entity62 came to @entity26 , has been judged to speak @entity4 well enough not to need additional lessons			2
the instruction for @entity62 to brush up on his language skills is significant			0
the £ 18m @entity66 has improved greatly from a shaky start to his career at @entity69 but communication in the @entity1 defence has never been as strong with him in goal as it was during the eras of @entity75 and @entity76			0
@entity6 ’s move is sure to be welcomed by some @entity1 fans who are worried that the club are losing their traditional identity after spending £ 150m on new , predominantly foreign players this summer while letting academy graduates @entity83 and @entity84 leave .			0

@entity1 manager wants all his players speaking in @entity4
@entity6 has ordered @entity29 - speaking players to have lessons
@entity13 and @entity14 will be in a beginners ' together
@entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 in a intermediate class
