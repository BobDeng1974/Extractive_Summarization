by @entity0 published : 08:31 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 12:11 est , 12 june 2013 a boxer who threatened @entity2 with acts of ‘ insane violence ’ on @entity5 hours after drummer @entity6 was hacked to death was jailed for four months today			1
@entity8 , 27 , was arrested near his south @entity10 home after he posted his threats with a photo of himself wearing a balaclava and pointing a gun at the camera			1
@entity8 , who used a @entity5 page in the name of ‘ @entity18 ’ , wrote on may 22 this year , just after the @entity20 execution : ‘ i will do a lot worse than what took place yesterday and i have like minded people behind me ’			1
in the post , @entity8 encouraged his ‘ fellow countrymen ’ and ‘ my beloved @entity27 ’ to follow his lead			1
image : @entity8 had donned a balaclava and gripped an imitation weapon as he threatened @entity2 with ' revenge ' in a vile post put on @entity5 after the death of @entity6 he said : ' you @entity2 are n’t the only people that make explosives and your ( corr ) not the only people willing to commit acts of insane violence			1
he concluded his message with hate with a variation on the @entity27 slogan , ‘ never surrender ’ , adding : ‘ revenge will be taken ! ’ the judge conceded that ‘ what happened in @entity20 a few weeks ago shocked the whole nation ’ but he said @entity8 ’s case was ‘ abhorrent ’			1
jailing @entity8 for four months judge @entity52 said the aggravating factors were his ‘ glorification of firearms ’ and the incitement of ‘ revenge attacks ’			2
@entity8 admitted that the handgun was only a bb gun and that he was drunk when he made the offensive post			2
he had also engaged with a muslim online soon afterwards - a conversation which led him to take down his post			0
but by this time it had already gone ‘ viral ’ and the damage had been done			0
@entity8 lost his job as a scaffolder as a result of the publicity surrounding the case			0
shameful : this is the grossly offensive message @entity8 posted on @entity5 in the 24 hours after @entity6 died , which led to him being jailed today his previous convictions include possession of an imitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence , dishonesty and attempted robbery			1
but despite his support for the far right group , it emerged at @entity83 that @entity27 supporters have accused @entity8 of ‘ damaging the cause ’			1
@entity8 ’s solicitor told the court that he ‘ has had telephone calls from members of the @entity27 threatening him and telling him if he goes to prison he will be assaulted ’			1
the reasons for the @entity27 threats are unclear but a page from the @entity27 news reads : ‘ as much as we are saddened by yesterday ’s news from @entity20 , we feel it is more important than ever to keep tabs on extremists on the far right			2
emblem : @entity8 used this picture showing his apparent links to his ' beloved @entity27 ' , but members of the group have since threatened him because he is damaging their cause , the court heard ‘ meet @entity108 aka @entity8 from @entity109			1
a boxer who posts pictures of himself with a gun			0
‘ if that is not worrying enough he posts the below on his @entity5 page where he threatens to make a bomb and go on a killing spree			2
‘ this has been reported to the @entity119 ’s @entity118			0
’ speaking to @entity121 ’s today programme this week , @entity27 leader @entity120 said : ‘ every single speech i gave since @entity20 , in fact in the last four years , condemn any acts of violence			0
so the only way to solve this is through democratic process , through peacefully protesting			0
’ when it became clear that district judge @entity52 intended to pass a jail sentence today @entity8 visibly paled and said : ‘ i have n’t done anything wrong			0
they tried to cut someone ’s head off and i posted something online			0
they want to send me to prison ? ‘ what jail is he going to put me , bearing in mind there are @entity2 in all of them ’ , he added			0
@entity8 , of @entity142 , @entity10 , admitted posting a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent , obscene or menacing character contrary to the @entity146			2
he has already served half of the sentence and will be elligble for release in a month .			0
