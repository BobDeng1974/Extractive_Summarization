by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:09 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:25 est , 31 december 2013 scientists have issued the first weather forecast for an alien ‘ super-earth ’ orbiting a star 40 light years from @entity7			1
using the @entity10 to study light filtering through the planet 's atmosphere , @entity9 astronomers determined that the planet gj 1214b is shrouded by high - altitude clouds			1
the world orbits very close to its ‘ red dwarf ’ parent star , too , raising temperatures to 232 ° c and the scientists predict it 's going to remain cloudy and hot for the forseeable future			1
an artist 's impression of the cloudy super-earth exoplanet gj 1214b			0
using the @entity10 , astronomers have determined the planet is shrouded by high - altitude clouds			1
its parent star also raises temperatures to 232 ° c and these weather conditions are expected to last ' for the foreseeable future ' gj 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the @entity35			1
it is roughly 2.7 times larger than the @entity7 and its star lies in the constellation @entity39			2
using the @entity10 to study light filtering through the planet 's atmosphere , @entity9 astronomers determined that the planet gj 1214b is shrouded by high - altitude clouds			1
earlier studies of the planet were not able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like @entity51 in our own solar system			0
as was the case with @entity51 until the era of space probes , the cloud cover makes it impossible to know exactly what the planet 's surface is like			1
@entity62 , whose star lies in the constellation @entity39 , is roughly 2.7 times larger than the @entity7			2
earlier studies of the planet were not able to tell whether it had clear or cloudy skies but now scientists are confident it is both hot and permanently overcast - a little like @entity51 in our own solar system			0
what these clouds are made of is still unknown , but computer simulations suggest they could be composed of potassium chloride or zinc sulphide dust			0
@entity78 , planets having a mass between that of the @entity7 and @entity77 , are believed to be among the most common in our galaxy			2
dr @entity81 , leader of the @entity83 astronomers , said : ' i think it ’s very exciting that we can use a telescope like @entity10 that was never designed with this in mind , do these kinds of observations with such exquisite precision , and really nail down some property of a small planet orbiting a distant star			1
' the observations took around 96 hours spread over 11 months - the longest period ever devoted to studying a single exoplanet with the space telescope			1
dr @entity81 's team analysed near - infrared light from the planet each time it passed in front of , or ' transited ' , its star , an event that occurs every 38 hours			1
gj 1214b was discovered in 2009 by the @entity35			0
it is roughly 2.7 times larger than the @entity7 and its star lies in the constellation @entity39			2
it is called a super-earth because it has a mass between that of the @entity7 and @entity77 , pictured			0
exoplanet gj 436b is shown here to demonstrate scale writing in @entity119 , the scientists described the findings as an important milestone on the way to identifying potentially habitable @entity7 - like planets among the stars			0
follow - up observations suggested that the planet ’s atmosphere was either mostly composed of water vapour or dominated by hydrogen with high - altitude clouds			1
the new study ruled out a cloud - free atmosphere of water , methane , nitrogen , carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide			0
a ' flat ' signal from the @entity10 data , lacking chemical fingerprints , indicated the presence of high altitude clouds of uncertain composition shielding what lay beneath			2
the @entity9 space agency @entity147 's 6.5 metre @entity146 , due to be placed in orbit later this decade , is expected to reveal more information about exoplanet atmospheres			0
' looking forward , @entity146 will be transformative , ' said graduate student @entity151 , another member of the @entity83 team			0
' the new capabilities of this telescope will allow us to peer through the clouds on planets like @entity62			0
but more than that , it may open the door to studies of @entity7 - like planets around nearby stars			0

@entity165 orbits a star situated 40 light years from @entity7
using the @entity10 , astronomers have been able to study the planet 's atmosphere for the first time
it is shrouded by clouds and its star raises it temperature to around 232 ° c
the observations took around 96 hours spread over 11 months
