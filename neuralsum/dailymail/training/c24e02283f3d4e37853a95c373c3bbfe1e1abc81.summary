imagine a world where your credit score is judged by the company you keep on social networks , and not just on your spending habits			2
or a time when you pay for shopping using an eye - scanner , transfer money with the flick of a finger and meet your bank manager in the local supermarket			0
these are just some of the predictions made by financial technology expert @entity16 for the future of banking - and he believes the wheels for this revolution are already in motion			1
he said cards will soon disappear , to be replaced with mobile phones or tablets , used to tap against readers to pay for goods and service			0
mr @entity16 also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops , cafes and supermarkets mr @entity16 , sold his last start - up to @entity39 in 2011 and launched @entity40 : @entity41 , a digital training firm for banks among other businesses , a year later			1
speaking exclusively to the @entity45 , he said : ‘ we ’re on the brink of some seismic changes in the way we all use money			0
’ he said @entity52 users are already familiar with security prompts asking them to identify a friend ’s face before their log - in process is completed , for example			1
and in the future , banks could rely on such social networks in a way their customers have never seen before			2
for example , as those without social profiles become a shrinking minority , banks could ask their clients for permission to access them			2
financial tech expert @entity16 has revealed his vision for the future of banking			1
in the future , banks could rely on social networks in a way their customers have never seen before			2
for example , as those without social profiles become a shrinking minority , banks could ask their clients for permission to access them			2
according to @entity16 , cards will soon disappear , to be replaced with mobile phones used to tap against readers to pay for goods and services			1
but even that technology wo n’t last long , @entity16 continued			1
instead , banks will rely on finger scanners and retina readers to process transactions			2
@entity16 also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops , cafes and supermarkets			1
and he believes that stripping away card systems in favour of smart tech will mean the end of long queues			2
and those without accounts could be penalised when applying for credit			2
users with a stable social network would be seen as less of a credit risk than those whose friends chop and change regularly - giving them access to better credit			1
@entity16 said : ‘ the old saying largely remains a truism			1
you are defined by the company you keep			0
‘ you could easily have a scenario in ten years where a customer ’s chances of credit are determined not only on their spending , but also on their friends , family members and their social profile			1
‘ by giving up a bit more information to the banks , you might stand to benefit in a wider choice of products			2
’ mr @entity16 , 43 , continued that financial services are already facing competition like never before from the likes of @entity132 , which last month said it would offer finance to hundreds of thousands of small @entity135 firms already signed up to its @entity137 payments service			1
as a result , banks are being forced to innovate quickly , with credit and debit cards likely to be the first casualty			1
according to @entity16 , cards will soon disappear , to be replaced with mobile phones used to tap against readers to pay for goods and services			1
but even that technology wo n’t last long , @entity16 continued			1
in the future , banks could rely on social networks , such as @entity52 , in a way their customers have never seen before			1
for example , as those without social profiles become a shrinking minority , banks could ask their clients for permission to access them			2
and those without accounts could be penalised @entity162 recently revealed a first - of - its - kind biometric reader that identifies customers by the veins in their finger			2
instead of using a pin or password , @entity162 customers press their finger on a scanner ( pictured ) plugged into their computer instead , banks will rely on finger scanners and retina readers to process transactions			2
‘ credit and debit cards are history			2
card systems are expensive to run , relatively insecure and pretty easy to copy , ’ added mr @entity16			1
‘ soon you 'll simply walk into a shop , zap your phone [ or smartwatch ] against a contact point or barcode , and money will be taken from your account to pay for it			0
‘ @entity187 is already running this type of system through the @entity193 app ’s @entity191 feature			0
you just scan the barcode of an item you want to buy and , in a second , it ’s yours			0
' @entity196 will also mean more people can pay for items using their phones			0
‘ but that wo n’t last long either , ' continued mr @entity16			1
' i expect to see finger and retina scanners as part of our lives in the not too distant future			0
’ according to @entity16 , cards will soon disappear , to be replaced with mobile phones or wireless wristbands			1
@entity212 band ( pictured ) can already be used to pay for goods , and underground tickets ‘ credit and debit cards are history			0
card systems are expensive to run , relatively insecure and pretty easy to copy , ’ added mr @entity16			1
he said customers are also already able to walk into a shop , place their phone or smartwatch against a contact point , and pay for goods			0
@entity224 running @entity187 pay is pictured @entity162 recently revealed a first - of - its - kind biometric reader that identifies customers by veins in their finger			0
instead of using a pin or password , @entity162 customers press their finger on a scanner plugged into their computer			0
@entity187 's @entity191 lets people scan barcodes and learn more about products , using their phone the reader uses infrared lights to scan the veins and blood flow under the skin to confirm the user ’s identity			0
customers then have to scan the same finger a second time to confirm their transaction as part of the bank 's ongoing bid to combat fraud			0
the banking giant is additionally leading the way with contactless payment wristbands			0
‘ but that ’s really just the start of how tech is changing the banking industry , ’ added mr @entity16			1
‘ the bank of the future is going to be a lot more fun to engage with for customers than it is right now			0
’ @entity16 also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops , cafes and supermarkets as banking goes back to the future			1
he believes that stripping away clumsy card systems in favour of smart tech will mean the end of long queue			0
it also means customers will be able to get more tailored , expert advice as bank staff come to them			0
@entity16 said : ‘ the advance of tech means the end of clunky processes and waiting six weeks for an appointment to see a manager			1
‘ back in the fourteenth century , banking was done in coffee shops - that ’s where we ’re going back to			1
‘ banks are already looking at getting their advisors to their customers more directly			0
this is just a natural progression			0
‘ the bigger branches can become versions of @entity187 ’s genius stores - stripped back , slicker and offering the kind of service customers can only dream of now			0
‘ if you cut back on transactional costs , it means banks can offer more specialised advice on mortgages and investments to everyone , not just the privileged few			0
’ but @entity16 said firms , including banks , need to give their staff the skills now to face the digital future			1
‘ the companies that take digital seriously now , that give their employees training in coding , apps , social media and security , will take the initiative			0
they wo n’t get left behind			0

the predictions were made financial tech expert @entity16
he claimed that credit scores could soon be based on @entity52 friends
banks could also move into coffee shops and supermarkets
payment technology will become wireless and be based on biometric data
and mr @entity16 claims this could happen within the next decade
