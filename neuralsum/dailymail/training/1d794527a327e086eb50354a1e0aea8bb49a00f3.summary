by @entity0 published : 05:13 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 20:57 est , 14 november 2012 one in three businesses is losing money and the road to @entity6 's economic recovery will be ' long and winding ' , the @entity1 warned yesterday			1
experts dubbed these firms ' zombie businesses ' which have survived only because interest rates are at an historic low and the banks are reluctant to pull the plug on them			0
it raises fears of large - scale job losses if the base rate of 0.5 per cent is raised , a move which would tip many firms over the edge			1
the big squeeze : how the @entity22 rate of inflation compares to year - on - year rises in pay , according to the @entity26 the @entity27 published yesterday said the latest estimate is that 30.6 per cent of firms are losing money , a number which has increased sharply in recent years			1
the report warned the current situation ' may have allowed businesses that will face lower demand in the longer term to continue trading '			2
sir @entity38 , the @entity1 's governor , painted a bleak picture of the future , offering little hope for an improvement in @entity6 's anaemic economic recovery			1
nearly 30million people aged 16 and over are in work – but almost half of the new jobs created in recent months were part - time , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the part - time boom has seen many workers forced to accept such work despite desperately needing the higher salary that comes with a full - time job			1
between july and september , the number in work jumped by 100,000 to 29.58million , equal to more than 1,000 new jobs every day , the @entity26 said			1
but of the 100,000 increase in employment , only 51,000 were full - time jobs and 49,000 were part - time			1
the @entity26 said 8.1million people , close to an all - time record , are working part - time			1
of these , 1.4million say it is only because they ‘ could not find a full - time job			1
’ overall , the @entity26 said unemployment has dropped again , down 49,000 between july and september to 2.51million			1
long - term unemployment is a ballooning problem			2
nearly half of those aged 50 and over have been unemployed for more than 12 months			0
he said people should not be optimistic after the latest official figures from the @entity26 revealed economic growth of 1 per cent between july and september			1
the figure is ' not a reliable guide to the future ' , warned sir @entity38			0
he said : ' continuing the recent zig - zag pattern , output growth is likely to fall back sharply in the fourth quarter as the boost from the @entity80 in the summer is reversed – indeed , output may shrink a little this quarter			1
' the report said @entity6 should brace itself for ' a period of persistently low growth '			0
sir @entity38 , who retires next year , added : ' we have decided the chances of a rapid recovery are a good deal less than we thought			0
' he said economic growth is ' more likely to be below than above its historical average rate over the entire forecast period ' – which is the next three years			1
the @entity1 's report reveals the number of firms which are collapsing is much lower than in the last recession in the early 1990s			1
around 55 companies every day are being plunged into insolvency , according to the financial information firm @entity98			0
but the @entity1 said the number of loss - making firms is high , amid warnings from experts that a third of ' zombie businesses ' are at risk if they do not urgently get help to solve their problems			1
a ' zombie ' company can pay the interest on its debts but not repay the debt itself , leaving it particularly vulnerable to a rise in borrowing costs or a loss of business			2
warning : @entity38 , governor of the @entity1 , has predicted the economy could be shrinking again due to a ' @entity119 ' recovery @entity120 , chief executive of the @entity121 , which represents experts who specialise in rescuing businesses , said : ' if they are not given the tough , loving care that they need , they are definitely at risk			1
' the worrying thing about the situation is that there are jobs at risk			0
these businesses employ people whose livelihood depends on their job			1
' employment minister @entity137 said the fall in youth unemployment was particularly welcome @entity140 , chairman of investment firm @entity141 , said the fact that businesses are being kept artificially alive is a problem			0
he told the @entity145 that in previous recessions they would have been ' tossed into the bonfire and something better emerges ' , but ' the @entity150 system ' is not happening			0
' about 10 per cent of the private sector workforce are working in companies which should have been sorted out , ' mr @entity140 said			2
' that is one of the reasons the economy is not recovering quickly			2
we need failure as part of the solution			2
' according to @entity164 , the industry group that represents insolvency practitioners , there are as many as 146,000 zombie businesses in the @entity6			0
despite the weak state of the economy , the @entity1 's report said that employment in the private sector remains ' puzzlingly robust '			1
at present , 23.9million people work in the private sector , the largest number since records began , although many are having to work part - time unwillingly			1
@entity176 , chief economist at the @entity177 , said the report paints ' a grim but realistic outlook for the @entity6 economy '			2
unemployment fell by 49,000 in the three months to september , but is still much higher than three years ago supermarket giant @entity182 received a staggering 8,000 applicants for 400 jobs at a brand new store opening later this month			1
it means 20 people were chasing every single job at the new branch			2
the new store is opening in @entity190 , @entity191 , which is an area renowned for its high levels of unemployment			0
@entity194 says that 65 per cent of jobs have gone to people from the @entity190 area			2
council leader @entity198 said : ' the amount of applications does show that we do need more jobs in the area , which is why we are keen to promote regeneration schemes			0
' the shopworkers ' trade union , @entity205 , says the huge flood of job requests is a sign of high unemployment rates			2
but it said competition is often fierce among candidates for @entity182 jobs as pay rates are better than at other supermarkets			0
the @entity205 spokesman said : ' the sort of response a store gets to its job adverts depends on the level of unemployment in the area			2
' this is probably a sign of the times , but also probably a sign of the remuneration package and other benefits they offer			0
they are one of the best payers in the supermarket sector			0
' among the new recruits at the @entity190 store is a former bus driver who struggled to find work after he left his job of 20 years on the death of his wife			1
a single mother struggling to support her young daughter has also been recruited			0
the company set up a special training scheme for men and women who applied and had been out of work for more than six months			0
the scheme , run in cooperation with @entity194 , saw the last 92 trainees complete their course this week			0
@entity182 's corporate affairs manager @entity250 said : ' this is the kind of response we get when we open a new store			0
' there are great opportunities for people			0
in the last few store openings , we have had huge numbers of applications			0
' all our pay rates are over the minimum wage and we are the leading payer in the industry			0

problems within *eurozone* lead to fears of a *triple* - dip recession
number out of work falls by 49,000 to 2.51million
people in a part - time job because they could not fund full - time work still *250,000* higher than two years ago
