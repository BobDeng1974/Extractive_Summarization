nearly a quarter of those killed by @entity4 drone strikes in @entity5 could have been civilians , a report claims			1
with @entity8 and @entity9 facing growing pressure to cut drone programmes , the figures are certain to inflame relationships with @entity5			1
the study released yesterday by the @entity14 concludes , after scrutinising estimates from three monitoring groups , that of the 3,520 killed by @entity4 drones in @entity5 , @entity18 and @entity19 over the last 12 years , 457 – or 11 per cent – were civilians			2

@entity4 has sought to play down the ‘ collateral damage ' of the drone strikes in @entity5 's regions bordering @entity32 where @entity34 terrorists have sought refuge			1
