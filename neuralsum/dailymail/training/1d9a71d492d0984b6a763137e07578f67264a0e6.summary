@entity7 , principal of @entity8 's in @entity9 , argued that referring to independent schools as bastions of ' elite and privilege ' is outdated			1
and he claimed some parents pay far more by moving house or hiring private tutors to keep their children in state schools			2
speaking before taking up the role , he warned against ' outdated ' perceptions of private schooling			2
@entity0 's education spokesman @entity20 was accused of launching a class war last month after he warned public schools they must do more to work with state schools or lose tax breaks worth £ 70million by 2020			1

' he added : ' my school , like many , many other @entity25 schools , are real world schools where mum and dad are working very hard to prioritise their income to benefit their children			0
' and it 's funny , i would say 80 per cent of the social apartheid one sees in schools at the moment is actually because of geography , and some parents can access incredible education and incredibly successful schools because they can afford incredibly expensive housing in expensive areas of the country			2
