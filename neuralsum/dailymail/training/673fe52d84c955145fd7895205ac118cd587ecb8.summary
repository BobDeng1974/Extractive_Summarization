@entity8 , 59 , had hoped to see her stepfather , @entity9 , 74 , after he passed away at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
a nurse on the ward took her to a bay but then drew back the curtains to reveal an empty bed			0
the nurse then confessed he did n't where the body was			1
shocked : @entity8 , pictured left with her husband @entity20 , was stunned when she asked hospital staff to see the body of her deceased stepfather @entity9 , right , but was then told they did n't know where it was mrs @entity8 said : ' it was disturbing			1
the nurse led us to his bed on the ward and opened the curtains , but the bed was empty			0
' then he started shouting down the corridor to the other nurses , asking where he 'd been moved to			0
' as if it was n't hard enough being told he was dead without that			2
' this was a senior nurse and he had no idea where one of his patients was			0
we found it all completely unprofessional , insensitive and distressing			0
' she eventually saw the body after other staff members tracked it down to a private room on the same ward			1
earlier this month , @entity50 bosses wrote to mrs @entity8 and husband @entity20 apologising for the blunder claiming it was ' unacceptable ' and fell short of their standards			1
but the fuming family are now set for a face - to - face meeting with hospital chiefs to address a host of other complaints they have about his care during his three - week stay at the @entity62 , based at the @entity50 's @entity10 , in september			1
blunder : a spokesperson for @entity65 apologised ' unreservedly ' to the family for the error at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 the couple , from @entity11 , allege mr @entity9 did n't receive proper medication , was left unwashed and had problems with his feeding tube			1

' we went to the hospital every day and were shocked by the number of mistakes being made			2
' one day @entity9 had n't been given his medication , the next he had n't been washed			1
he wore a @entity81 feeding tube which became dislodged and there were a series of errors in booking him in for surgery to have that resolved			0
and then to top it all off , we went to see him after he died and the nurses did n't know where he was			2
' we put our trust in the @entity92 to look after @entity9 , but it failed him			2
' mrs @entity8 added : ' the @entity50 does n't seem to be accepting much responsibility			1
' we received a letter responding to the complaint , but there was very little by way of apology - and it was full of mistakes			0
anger : mr and mrs @entity103 also submitted several other complaints about the treatment mr @entity9 received while at the hospital ' at one point , it refers to my stepdad being reviewed by a doctor on october 9 - but he was dead and buried by then			1
' he died on september 9			0
the fact that they can get details like that wrong just made us even more upset			0
' @entity117 , chair of @entity12 @entity118 , said : ' this is shocking and totally unacceptable			2
' we hear so many cases of patients being shifted around hospitals and the staff not having a clue where they are , and it should n't be happening - especially with someone who is deceased			2
' this must have been very upsetting and stressful for the family			0
mistakes like these should n't be happening			0
' a spokesperson for @entity65 and @entity133 said : ' our interim director of rehabilitation and @entity135 wrote to the family addressing their concerns including the misunderstanding on where their father 's body was after he had died			1
