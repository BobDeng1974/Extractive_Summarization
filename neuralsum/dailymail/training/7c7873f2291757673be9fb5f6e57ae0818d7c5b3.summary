@entity1 captain @entity0 has criticised the decision to allow @entity4 fans in to tuesday night 's behind - closed - doors @entity6 game in @entity8			1
@entity10 's @entity9 was supposed to be empty apart from media , club officials and sponsors guests after @entity14 punished @entity4 for problems with their supporters in the past			1
but @entity1 played out a disappointing 2 - 2 draw against a background of noise and fierce support from about 300 fans in the main stand			1
around 300 @entity4 fans were in the main stand , despite the match being played behind closed doors the @entity4 fans watched their side come from behind to secure a point against @entity1 @entity14 had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by @entity4 fans official crowd - 0 club delegates - 75 per club centre circle boys and parents - 50 media - 150 @entity14 partners ( sponsors ) - 300 with no @entity1 fans present , it made for a peculiar environment and now @entity14 are to investigate after suggestions sponsors tickets and media passes were sold to regular fans on the black market			1
an angry @entity0 said : ' this one really annoys me and maybe it 's on top of other things as well			2
' you say " no fans " then all of a sudden you turn up and basically the only team that has n't got fans is @entity1			2
city threw away a two - goal lead as @entity56 and @entity57 scored in the second half for the hosts @entity57 's late penalty made it 2 - 2 after @entity1 had looked comfortable after going two goals ahead in @entity10 @entity62 scored @entity1 's second , sliding home to meat a cross from their first goalscorer @entity67 ' so who 's getting punished ? who is being done for racism ? @entity1 or @entity10 , you know ? ' i do n't have a problem , they 'll say it 's sponsors and so on and they need to give certain allocations , but why are we getting punished , you know ? ' and again , because you 'll have people in your papers writing columns saying ' he should be looking at his own performance and stuff ' – so , done – we 've analysed it and we know we should have done better and that but things like this are unacceptable to honest , there 's just no fairness in it			0
' some of the spectators situated in front of the @entity1 officials in the stand appeared to be drunk and spent much of the game standing up with beer glasses singing and chanting			1
@entity1 were leading 2 - 0 at half - time but only took a point in the end after a controversial late penalty gave @entity4 their first point of the group stages			2
' it does n't have an effect on the players , ' added @entity0			0
players from both teams line up before the match with a respect banner campaigning against racism @entity1 captain @entity0 was not afraid to criticise that @entity4 fans were allowed in to watch @entity0 questioned who was being punished after @entity4 fans appeared to have been allowed in ' its just little things when you leave with a result like this			1
' obviously you ca n't deny there 's a bit of frustration , and i 'm not looking for an excuse , but if you want to play it fair then , fair enough , you 've got to let your sponsors have some tickets but why the hell do we not have any fans here ? ' why ? what have our fans done wrong ? ' so it needs to be looked at , it needs to be changed , because our fans should n't be punished			0
' @entity1 have made their views known to @entity14 and the governing body have promised to look in to the issue			0
officials from @entity14 were seen taking photos and videos of the spectators during the second half			0
despite @entity62 and @entity67 's efforts , the game ended 2 - 2 meaning @entity1 have failed to win in @entity14 this season			0
