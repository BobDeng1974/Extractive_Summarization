by @entity0 published : 15:02 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 02:30 est , 16 october 2012 gardeners and ‘ allotment amateurs ’ have been accused of fuelling a national potato shortage by spreading a devastating fungal blight			1
farmers across the @entity6 have suffered amid the wettest summer in 100 years , with waterlogged fields and many crops left to rot			1
the weather has made potatoes vulnerable to fungal infections that damage and stunt their growth			1
commercial farmers across the @entity6 have suffered amid the wettest summer in 100 years , with downpours that have left fields waterlogged			1
here a farmer shows some freshly dug new potatoes farmers say the situation has been made worse by the army of ‘ grow - your - own ’ gardeners			1
the @entity24 says they are responsible for spreading the blight because they ca n’t identify it quickly and do not know how to control outbreaks			2
the so - called ‘ late blight ’ affecting potato crops is caused by fungal spores that reproduce rapidly in warm and moist conditions and are then spread on the wind			1
this sort of fungal blight – phytophthora infestans – was responsible for the @entity36 and the devastation of crops in the @entity39 and much of @entity41 in the 1800s			0
to blame ? ' grow your own ' gardeners , like this woman on an allotment in @entity46 , south @entity47 , have been accused of unwittingly helping to spread a disease affecting potatoes @entity50 of @entity51 recently told a group of gardeners in @entity54 that she grew her own potatoes , but had suffered a poor crop this year while farmers routinely douse crops in fungicides to kill off the spores , gardeners tend to avoid using such chemicals			1
the potato blight fungus was responsible for the @entity65 potato famine between 1845 and 1852			0
the famine , referred to as the @entity36 in @entity65 , devastated the country , where one in three people depended on potatoes as their main , if not only , source of food			0
many starved or died from related illness and the famine saw the population fall by at least a fifth due to the deaths and resulting emigration			0
as a result , even small garden or allotment plots of infected potatoes can threaten farms across a wide area			0
the @entity24 warned they were responsible for a ‘ disproportionate amount of overall blight pressure ’ in warm , wet seasons			2
council chairman @entity85 said it would be better if amateurs left the growing of potatoes to the professionals			0
he told @entity92 magazine : ‘ people should be encouraged to grow their own vegetables to learn about the origins of their food			0
‘ but the blight risk is real , and it would be preferable if people bought healthy , well - produced potatoes from their retailer , rather than grow their own			2
’ the spores can survive through the winter months on vegetation , in the soil and on any potato plants that are not properly cleared at the end of the harvest			0
farmers will routinely douse their crops in fungicides in order to kill off the spores but that has not helped this year @entity113 and @entity114 ’s have warned of shortages of @entity6 - grown vegetables and higher prices in the run - up to @entity119			2
stores have doubled the price of popular varieties such as @entity123 over the past year , while further increases on all types of root vegetables are expected			0
some retailers have even put up warning notices saying that fresh produce was not up to the normal ‘ beauty pageant ’ standard because of the rain			0
the @entity24 has contacted amateur gardening organisations to produce a special blight fact - sheet and other guidance and advice on growing potatoes			1
it has also recruited hundreds of ‘ blight monitors ’ to check on the development of late blight both on allotments and in commercial crops .			1

commercial farmers have suffered wettest summer in 100 years
downpours left fields waterlogged and much of the crop left to rot
it has also made potatoes particularly vulnerable to fungal infections
so - called ' late blight ' is caused by fungal spores spread on the wind
the @entity24 says ' grow your own ' gardeners make it worse
