she 's famous for her conservative sense of style but that did n't stop @entity6 's @entity5 @entity4 from flashing a glimpse of thigh during a reception at the @entity10 today			1
the 42 - year - old opted for an unusually short cream shift dress for the event , which was held to honour members of the @entity15 - the @entity6 cinema association			1
@entity4 's daring new look represented a departure from her usual midi length , although she did take some precautions , teaming the dress with neat courts and a pair of opaque black tights			1
the @entity15 is one of the biggest champions of @entity6 cinema and is responsible for the annual @entity42 - @entity6 's equivalent of the @entity43			1
the current president , film producer @entity44 , was among the guests to greet the @entity6 royals at the @entity10 this morning , while his predecessors include @entity48 , a pioneering director who mentored @entity49			2
this is not the first time the @entity6 royals , who are currently in mourning for the late queen @entity53 , have shown their support for the arts in recent months			0
@entity4 in particular is known to be a fan and travelled to @entity57 at the beginning of october to open an exhibition dedicated to @entity6 court painter , @entity60			2
daring : the ultra-high hemline represents a departure from her usual conservative sense of style stylish : the dress was worn at a reception for the @entity15 stop ! @entity31 stepped in to help his wife at one point , when she appeared to be going the wrong way later the same week , she and @entity31 were both on hand for the launch of a new @entity6 dictionary and have consistently championed the arts since ascending to the throne in june			1
the two have also overseen a sea - change in the way the @entity6 royal family does business , with @entity31 banning private employment and accepting lavish gifts last week			2
the new rules , which also apply to former @entity83 and his wife @entity84 , come into effect on @entity86 and are intended to avoid ' compromising the dignity of the institution '			0
@entity31 's move comes after his father 's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an € 18m ( £ 14m ) yacht			0
@entity97 , which @entity83 was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity , became a regular plaything of the @entity6 royals , who used it during summer holidays in @entity103			0
@entity31 's new - look @entity6 monarchy is closer in style to the @entity107 system , which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles			1
all smiles : both halves of the royal couple appeared to be on good form as they met filmmakers changes : @entity31 is in the midst of an overhaul of the @entity6 royal family 's public image glamorous : @entity4 , who will also be affected by the changes , looked fresh - faced and happy as part of his drive to modernise the institution , the 46 - year - old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an ' exemplary manner ' likely to ' earn citizens ' appreciation , respect and trust			1
' despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their @entity143 and @entity6 counterparts , the @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 monarchs and their families do accept gifts , although like the @entity143 royals , most have to be declared			0
in the case of the @entity143 royal family , gifts either become part of the @entity150 and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution			0
although the @entity5 is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like @entity83 , she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits , including a collection of shells , a set of lacrosse sticks , sunglasses , a pair of sandals , pineapples , eggs , a box of snail shells , a grove of maple trees , a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns			0
the @entity5 has also been given a number of horses , among them her @entity179 mount , @entity180 , and a series of exotic animals , including a canary , jaguars , sloths and an elephant called @entity187 - all of which were given to @entity189 .			0
