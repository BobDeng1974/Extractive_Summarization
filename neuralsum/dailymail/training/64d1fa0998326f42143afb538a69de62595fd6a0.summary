these are tough times for @entity1 right now , and he will need to keep the fans onside			2
so is this why he has openly picked a fight with the @entity6 manager ? i do n't think there is any empirical evidence to back this up but my guess , based on the views of football fans from the city of @entity15 that i have spoken with over the years , is that a sizeable number - perhaps even a majority of supporters there - do n't care about the fortunes of the @entity6 team at all			1
the former @entity23 striker @entity22 was born in @entity15 but told me if it ever happened , he would even turn down an @entity6 call - up so that he could wait to play for the @entity26			2
@entity27 is deflecting attention away from @entity15 's bad start by picking a fight with @entity31 @entity32 is still sidelined after getting injured on international duty @entity15 striker @entity32 is battling to overcome a thigh problem @entity23 's @entity22 had no intention of ever playing for @entity6 should the call have come knocking plenty of @entity15 and @entity39 fans have rung into my show over the years to express their apathy towards the national team			1
@entity15 fans loved it when @entity45 retired from @entity6 duty at a relatively young age , and then admitted in his book that he cared more about @entity15 : ' defeats while wearing an @entity6 shirt never hurt me in the same way as losing with my club … the @entity44 mauled the @entity6 in the fight for my loyalties			2
' most of us put club before country , there is nothing extraordinary about that			0
but as @entity45 wrote , the @entity62 sing : ' we 're not @entity63 , we are @entity64			0
' there is a level of antipathy from a lot of @entity69 towards the @entity6 team that some might find shocking			0
@entity74 was overlooked for the @entity6 captaincy a few years ago , in favour of @entity77			2
@entity15 fans did n't particularly enjoy @entity31 's reign at @entity80 so perhaps some of them are quite keen to see him fail elsewhere			0
the negativity towards @entity6 from @entity15 fans reached a new low when one of them rang into my show last summer to express his support for @entity89 's @entity88 ahead of the @entity91 clash with @entity6			0
it is totally the right of any football fan to choose not to be bothered about the @entity6 team			0
but @entity1 is a clever guy , he will know by now the @entity98 feeling among some @entity15 fans , so it looks to me like he 's played the club versus country card early , to endear himself to the fans through a tricky period of transition			0
players get injured in training and in games in domestic and international football – that 's the reality			0
@entity1 sending some sort of dossier of instructions into the @entity6 camp with @entity32 is laughable			1
if all club managers did that , no players would be able to train , play or even meet up with the @entity6 squad			1
@entity31 has escalated his war of words with @entity15 boss @entity1 @entity1 is trying to get @entity32 up to speed after four weeks out @entity32 has n't played since @entity6 's friendly win against @entity122 last month it could be that @entity1 is upset that he was denied the opportunity to get involved with the @entity6 set - up – he could have been @entity125 's assistant , but @entity31 got the top job instead			1
i 'd like to think that bitterness is n't why @entity1 has caused such difficulty for @entity31			1
the fact is , if either or both of @entity1 ' signings @entity134 or @entity135 had started the season on fire , the boss would n't be so upset about @entity32 's injury			1
the @entity15 manager did superbly last season and he took the credit he deserved			0
in more difficult times so far this season , @entity1 would earn far more respect if he took criticism on board , rather than tapping into the @entity98 and @entity148 sentiment on @entity149 , and loading some of the blame onto the @entity6 manager .			1
