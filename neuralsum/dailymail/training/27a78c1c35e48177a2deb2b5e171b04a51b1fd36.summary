by @entity0 published : 04:56 est , 13 april 2012 updated : 04:56 est , 13 april 2012 human stem cells can be genetically engineered into ' warrior ' cells that fight @entity3 - and the new cells can attack @entity3 - infected cells inside a living creature			1
the breakthrough , by @entity8 scientists , is hoped to be the first step towards a treatment that can eradicate @entity3 from an infected patient			0
much hiv research focuses on vaccines or drugs that slow the virus 's progress - but this new technique could offer hope of a ' cure '			0
@entity3 virus : the @entity8 researchers found that genetically engineered stem cells can attack infected cells within human tissue budding of @entity3 virus from cell tissue : the new trial tested genetically engineered ' fighter ' cells in ' humanised ' mice - mice with human tissue the study , published april 12 in the journal @entity33 , demonstrates for the first time that engineering stem cells to form immune cells that target @entity3 is effective in suppressing the virus in living tissues			1
' we believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating hiv infection in infected individuals , in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body , ' said lead researcher @entity50			2
the scientists took @entity53 cytotoxic t lymphocytes — the ' killer ' t cells that help fight infection — from an @entity3 - infected individual and identified the molecule which guides the t cell in recognizing and killing @entity3 - infected cells			2
however , these t cells , while able to destroy @entity3 - infected cells , do not exist in great enough quantities to clear the virus from the body			1
so the researchers cloned the receptor and used this to genetically engineer human blood stem cells			0
they then placed the engineered stem cells into human thymus tissue that had been implanted in mice , allowing them to study the reaction in a living organism			1
current medical treatments use antiretroviral drugs to slow @entity3 's progress			0
@entity78 ration of a person sick from @entity3 the engineered stem cells developed into a large population of mature , multi-functional @entity3 - specific cells that could specifically target cells containing @entity3 proteins			2
the researchers also discovered that @entity3 - specific t cell receptors have to be matched to an individual in much the same way an organ is matched to a transplant patient			0
in this current study , the researchers similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature t cells that can attack @entity3 in tissues where the virus resides and replicates			1
they did so by using a surrogate model , the humanized mouse , in which hiv infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans			0
in a series of tests on the mice 's peripheral blood , plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells , the researchers found that the number of @entity111 " helper " t cells — which become depleted as a result of hiv infection — increased , while levels of @entity3 in the blood decreased			1
' we believe that this is the first step in developing a more aggressive approach in correcting the defects in the human t cell responses that allow @entity3 to persist in infected people , ' @entity50 said .			0

genetically engineered cells ' hunt ' @entity3 within living tissue
trials in mice grown to have human tissue in their bodies
offers hope of ' eradicating virus from body ' , says researcher
