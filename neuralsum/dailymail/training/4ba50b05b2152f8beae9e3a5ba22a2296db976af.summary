ringing in the @entity25 : police are urging the public not to make hoax emergency calls over the @entity25 @entity7 's call handlers receive an average 1,371 calls each day , and on @entity11 last year this figure reached 3,016			1
@entity31 , @entity7 's business lead for call handling , said : ' @entity34 and the @entity25 are the busiest times of the year for our call handling team			1
' we receive thousands of emergency and non-emergency calls which is why we would urge those making silly prank calls or thoughtless requests to think twice			1
prank : one caller reported the killer of @entity45 ( pictured ) , a character in @entity24 ' it is these thoughtless acts and deliberate jokes that can cost lives as that single action can have an impact on the swiftness of the police 's response to a real emergency			2
' i would urge everyone to think carefully before dialling so that our call handlers can focus their efforts on real emergencies as they happen			2
you would n't want your own call being delayed by a hoax so why have someone else 's ? ' the hoaxer who reported the @entity24 story gave his name as ' @entity70 ' and that he was reporting the murder of @entity45			0
he said : ' @entity72 has been done for it right , but it was ...			0

for example , if a car has been stolen , property damaged , to report a traffic collision or to give police information about crime			0
the 101 number is available 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and there is a single flat rate charge of 15p , no matter how long the call , the time of day or whether the call is made from a landline or mobile .			2
