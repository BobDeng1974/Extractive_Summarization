for decades , scientists have been trying to discover the origins of many insect species by studying the @entity4 centipede			2
with ancestors dating back over 400 million years , the centipede , also known as @entity6 , is mainly used to study the differences across invertebrates			1
now experts have revealed that the myriapod is missing an internal body clock , as well as vital light receptors seen across the animal kingdom by sequencing its genome for the first time			1
researchers from @entity19 have sequenced the first full myriapod genome from the @entity6 , which is of interest because they believe the creature could shed light on the ancestor of beetles and crabs , as well as some other invertebrates researchers from the universities of @entity30 and @entity19 uncovered these findings after they sequenced the first full myriapod genome - a complete set of @entity34 - from the centipede			1
@entity36 is part of the myripod family - a group that includes the centipedes and millipedes - which can be used to explore the genetic basis of centipede biology and the evolution of arthropods , including crabs and beetles			1
the team , whose findings are published in the journal @entity51 , used this sequence to recreate many features of the genetic make - up of the ancestral arthropod			0
for example , they discovered it has a large number of near - identical segments , with one or two pairs of legs on each			0
the type of centipede is favoured by scientists for the accessibility of its nests , from which embryos can be gathered for research purposes ( pictured )			0
experts have revealed that the myriapod is missing an internal body clock , as well as vital light receptors seen across the animal kingdom the genome sequence of the centipede @entity6 has allowed scientists to reconstruct many features of the genetic make - up of the ancestral arthropod			1
they hope to learn more about the evolution of insects , crustaceans , chelicerates such as spiders and myriapods - centipedes and millipedes - from it			2
the evolution of the huge biodiversity of these , animals and the information encoded in their genomes , is poorly understood			0
while a number of studies have been done on the fruit fly , drosophila melanogaster , the @entity93 genome could demonstrate that much has changed during the evolution of the fly genome , as well as insect genomes more generally			2
this makes a strong case for studying a wider range of species to develop a deeper understanding of animal biology			0
this centipede genome also provides examples of differences in how insects and myriapods independently conquered the land			2
for example , their sense of smell is achieved by different sets of molecules			0
lead author dr @entity120 , of @entity121 in @entity122 , said : ' this genome of @entity124 has proved to be particularly valuable in deducing the content of important gene families in the ancestral arthropod , this ancestor being the starting point for the evolution of the huge diversity of arthropods that we currently see today			2
' there has been a high turn - over in arthropod gene and genome organisation , with lots of rearrangements and plenty of gene losses during the evolution of animals , like the insects			1
' the sorts of reconstructions that have been made possible by this new myriapod genome provide a foundation for delving more deeply into the biology of these genetic changes			0
' perhaps one of the most surprising findings is that these centipedes seem to have lost the genes programming the known light receptors used by animals , as well as the genes controlling the body 's internal clock			1
professor @entity160 , of @entity19 , said : ' @entity93 live underground and have no eyes , so it is not surprising that many of the genes for light receptors are missing , but they behave as if they are hiding from the light			1
' they must have some alternative way of detecting when they are exposed			0
' @entity170 , too , that this creature appears to have no body clock - or if it does , it must use a system very different to other animals			1
' he began making trips to @entity176 on the @entity122 coast , to hunt out @entity178 a decade ago			0
research at the @entity181 beach is likely to continue for years .			0

researchers have sequenced the first full genome from @entity6
@entity186 is of interest because its ancestors date back 400 million years
its genome could explain the evolution of insects and crabs , for example
experts found the centipede has evolved without a body clock and light receptors - probably because it lives underground
