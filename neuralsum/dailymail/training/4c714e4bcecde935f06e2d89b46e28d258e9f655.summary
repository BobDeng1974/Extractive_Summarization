by @entity0 @entity2 sticker albums will cost , on average , £ 450 to complete , according to new research by two mathematicians in @entity5			1
with 640 stickers in the current @entity9 sticker album and 50p for a pack of six it should cost just £ 63.99 to complete the collection			2
however , allowing for duplicates it is estimated that 899 packs are actually needed at a cost of a whopping £ 449.50			2
costly : new research has shown the real price of completing the @entity2 sticker album straightforward : without duplicates and swaps it could be as little as £ 63.99 to finish the lot @entity22 from the economist attempted to explain the workings while taking into consideration his own personal knowledge of collecting			1
he told @entity28 : ' it 's a statistical technique called the @entity30			0
i wo n't go into the maths part because i do n't understand it but the idea is basically that if you as an individual just bought pack after pack after pack and did n't do any swapping how long would it take you to fill your album			0
' of course the probability of getting the card that you need goes down the more slots that you fill in the album			0
' so on average these statisticians from the @entity5 university reckon that it is just under 900 packs which in @entity50 is £ 450 give or take , which is a horrifyingly large amount			1
' setback : but in reality that figure is likely to be closer to £ 450			0

real cost of @entity2 sticker albums is *revealed* by @entity5 mathematicians
completing an album could cost as much as £ 450 and take 899 packs
