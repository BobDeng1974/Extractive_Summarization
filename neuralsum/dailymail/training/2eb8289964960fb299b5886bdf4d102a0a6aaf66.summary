she said the pair occasionally ' treat themselves at the chippy ' but that she has not had a @entity66 's @entity65 for five years			2
paranoid : mrs @entity6 suffers from a psychiatric disorder which causes sufferers to believe their partners have been unfaithful , even without evidence the mother - of - two ( left ) is unable to work due to back pain associated with her weight and says she can not afford to pay for the surgery herself			1
mr @entity51 ( pictured right with his wife ) is now her full - time carer true love : the couple met in 2011 over @entity78 and got married in november last year yesterday , she posted on her @entity78 page : ' all i got to say is mmm starbucks and burgerking , lol 2nd cheeseburger ... in 5 years xx ' instead , mrs @entity6 said she eats a healthy diet including chicken , fresh vegetables and fish and even bought a treadmill to try and lose some weight			1
but she is still continuing to gain weight and , despite being a size 14 when the pair first met , is now a size 24			1
she said : ' i used to be thin - i had an attractive hourglass figure like @entity96			0
i 'd love to have my old body back			0
' mrs @entity6 has already had the tests to see if she is eligible for the operation and hopes to be fitted with the band later this year			2
happy ever after : the pair ( pictured on their wedding day ) hit the headlines last year after @entity51 admitted forcing husband to take a lie detector test whenever he returns home to prove that he has been faithful and she has already said that , if she does lose weight and find a new lease of life , she would be willing to take a lie detector test herself , to prove to her husband that she has not been unfaithful			1
she said : ' i 'm sure @entity9 is worried i 'll slim down and leave him for someone else			2
once i 've slimmed down , if @entity9 wants me to take a lie detector test then i will			1

suspicious : @entity34 , played here by actor @entity157 @entity34 is a psychiatric disorder where a person is convinced their partner is being unfaithful - but with very little , if any , proof to confirm their fears			1

the condition presents itself as jealous and controlling behaviour and sometimes violence - but the two main characteristics are delusions and obsessions			0
in men the jealousy tends to focus around sexual infidelity , whereas in women it may centre around emotional betrayal			2

i did n’t mean to fall in love again after my last relationship but @entity9 stole my heart			2
‘ the only problem was that we lived so far apart			0
we started to get serious and made plans to move in together but i then discovered that @entity9 had been seeing another girl around the time we ’d first met			2
‘ he claimed he did n’t think we were exclusive because of the distance and i forgave him but i started to doubt whether or not he could be faithful			0
’ mrs @entity6 , who also suffers from bipolar and body dysmorphic disorders , added that her jealousy got worse when the pair moved in together as she tried to monitor mr @entity51 ’s every move			1
she installed child - proof filters on his laptop and mobile phone to stop him looking at explicit pictures of women and banned him from watching any television programmes featuring women , even programmes such as @entity218			1
‘ one night , an advert for a women ’s razor came on television and i felt panicky thinking that @entity9 was eyeing the model up , ' she said			2
' the only thing that could put my mind at rest was banning him from watching any programmes that have women in them			2
‘ now , i wo n’t even let him watch @entity218 in case he fancies @entity21 but i ’m scared he ’ll have a sneaky look when i ’m in another room			0
‘ that ’s why i decided to order the lie detector online			1
it was my only way of knowing for sure if @entity9 ’s eyes were wandering			0
in general , he ’s quite truthful but i have caught him lying a few times about looking at other women			0
’ mrs @entity6 was diagnosed with @entity34 last september , with the condition affecting her so badly that she could barely leave the house			1
