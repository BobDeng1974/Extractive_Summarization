thousands : in an announcement at the @entity4 capitol of @entity5 , maj. gen. @entity1 said thousands of soldiers were arriving as he spoke though the ebola virus has reached the @entity7 , thousands of @entity7 are taking the fight overseas to @entity10 in a mission called ' @entity12			1
' the mission to combat the deadly virus is stationed in @entity4 where other agencies are currently battling the outbreak			0
this @entity19 unit is mainly made up of @entity7 troops but also includes doctors , nurses , scientists , aviators , engineers , mechanics , and technicians , most of whom are volunteers from the @entity30 , the @entity17 reports			2
many have left their families behind to be a part of the now global effort to fight the outbreak which has claimed the lives of almost 5,000 in eight affected or previously affected countries including the @entity7 , according to a @entity38 report updated saturday			1
more than 10,000 confirmed , probable , and suspected cases of the virus have been reported in the eight countries			1
in an announcement made saturday from @entity4 's capitol of @entity5 , maj. gen. @entity1 said soldiers were arriving as he spoke			0
' thousands of my soldiers are arriving right now , ' @entity1 said , ' and they are as excited as i am , and ready to join this great team that you all have built so together we can stamp out @entity19			2
' the overall mission is the effort of the @entity7 @entity54 , the @entity55 , the @entity50 , and the @entity51			1
the @entity17 reports that health official 's plan for the mission include building 17 @entity72 ( @entity80 ) in @entity4 staffed by health - care workers , each with 100 beds			1
this is to remove @entity19 victims from their home , where they can easily spread the virus , and treat them at the @entity87 where the risk of spread is limited and the patients can get the appropriate care			2
the @entity87 will reportedly not be completed until december			0
the first is expected to be built within weeks			0
who : the graphic above , from the @entity38 , illustrates the growing number of cases of the ebola virus in @entity10 countries @entity55 : the @entity55 is allowing health - care workers to sign up to volunteer to be a part of the mission on it 's website @entity54 officials have reportedly stressed that @entity7 military personnel will not directly treat @entity19 patients or come in contact with them			1
the 17 @entity87 will in turn provide 1,700 beds to @entity19 patients , but a report in the infectious diseases section of @entity112 medical journal , says that 's not enough			2
the report stated that the number of beds needed to effectively control the outbreak in @entity118 -- where @entity5 is located -- substantially exceeds the number global officials intend to have in the @entity87			0
the journal based its findings on a mathematical analysis of the outbreak and the report states that the ' findings highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak and averting a catastrophic toll of @entity19 cases and deaths			0
' ebola : the ebola virus ( shown above ) has claimed the lives of a total of almost 5,000 in seven affected or previously affected @entity10 countries and the @entity7 nations : though this mission has the @entity7 military deploying primarily to @entity4 , other @entity7 civilian operations are taking place in @entity141 , @entity142 and other @entity10 nations despite the journal 's criticism , the mission is in full swing			1
the @entity55 is allowing health - care workers to sign up to volunteer to be a part of the mission on its website			1
the post reports that more than 3,000 people have volunteered online to serve in @entity10			0
however , those who signed up to volunteer have to undergo and make it through a screening process			0
volunteers have been offered top - flight medical treatment in case they get sick , according to the @entity17 , and a field - hospital near @entity5 's airport is expected to open in the beginning of november			0
the looming risk of contracting the virus is not the only difficulty presented by the mission			0
also at hand is the area 's harsh roads as well as mosquitos and malaria			0
also the potential @entity174 , @entity175 , and @entity176 21 - day quarantine for travelers from @entity10 who have dealt with @entity19 patients may be an impediment to potential volunteers			1
though this mission has the @entity7 military deploying primarily to @entity4 , other @entity7 civilian operations are taking place in @entity141 , @entity142 and other @entity10 nations			2
hundreds of @entity7 civilians have been in @entity10 for months fighting the deadly virus .			1

thousands of @entity7 soldiers and civilians are headed to @entity10 to fight @entity19 in ' @entity12 , ' the @entity7 's latest effort to combat the virus
the mission will include 17 @entity72 for those infected , but critics say that wo *n't* be enough
the @entity55 is *recruiting* health - care workers from around the world
