he later told his parents he had picked out an employee who he was going to follow into the back of the store and kill after watching @entity21 , because the character @entity26 ' got him to thinking '			2
he was going to watch them go into the back room , follow them back there , and hopefully the police would get him and shoot him first before he did anything			2
