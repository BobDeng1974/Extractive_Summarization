@entity1 â€™s @entity0 fell to defeat in their opening contest of the first @entity3			1
the @entity4 is playing in the four parts series along with some of the top names in the game past and present , with the first round of fixtures played in the @entity10 this weekend			2
@entity11 came back from 2 - 5 down in her clash with @entity13 to win 6 - 5 before @entity1 faced @entity16 champions @entity14 in the final singles needing a 6 - 2 win to force a shootout			1
two - time @entity20 champion @entity1 partnered @entity11 in the doubles in @entity22 but they could n't win their set @entity1 and @entity11 teamed up to play in the mixed doubles but eventually lost their crucial match 6 - 4 @entity1 poses with his @entity0 team - mates after day one of the inaugural @entity3 @entity1 , who was suffering with jet - lag , chases down a drop shot from @entity14 who beat @entity1 6 - 5 in their singles match @entity1 enjoyed teaming up with @entity11 in the mixed doubles during the inaugural round - robin @entity3 the four franchised teams will visit each other ( although star names might not play in all the matches			1
for example @entity1 is only expected to play the first event in @entity22 ) and the home team decides the order of play			2
matches are five sets and will involve a one set contest in men 's singles , women 's singles , men 's doubles , mixed doubles and men 's legends singles			0
the winners are the team that gains the most games within five sets and not the winner of the most sets like usual in tennis			0
if a set is tied at 5 - 5 then players play out a timed tie - break to decide the winner			2
in addition there are no advantage scores , meaning the winner of the point at deuce takes the game			0
a shot clock of 20 seconds is used in between points to keep the momentum of the matches quick and the change of ends only lasts a minute			0
the scoring system is rather labored : the winning team picks up four league points , the losing team receives two league points if they win 20 games , only one point if they win 10 - 19 games and gain no points for less than 9 games			0
the winning team pockets $ 1million each match			2
