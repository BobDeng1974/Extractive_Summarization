by @entity1 reporter published : 11:49 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 12:05 est , 6 september 2012 a budding @entity3 entrepreneur has high hopes for a piece of unique artwork he spectacularly created on the outskirts of space			2
@entity10 , 22 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , created his world - first artwork by using a helium - filled weather balloon with attached canvas and dripping paint tubes to float the project to an incredible 100,810ft			1
the freelance media technician sent his contraption soaring towards space from a field in @entity24 , @entity25 , with it crashing back down to earth when the balloon popped two hours later some 40 miles north of the launch site			0
the fragments of the balloon can be seen in the left of the photo he said : ' i did it really to push boundaries			0
it 's a world first thing , i wanted to do something that nobody has done before			2
it was a great feeling to achieve something like that			0
' he continued : ' i try and do creative , science and technology projects in order to inspire other people , entertain and educate them			0
' @entity10 's contraption was made up of a large helium - filled weather balloon , attached at the bottom to a payload which consisted of a parachute , small @entity62 hd camera , four paint pots with hanging tubes and the canvas , attached by wires			1
@entity10 , right , preparing the weather balloon prior to its launch in @entity24 , @entity25 as the project floated up to the edge of @entity74 's atmosphere , paint dripped down from the tubes onto the canvas , creating the artwork			1
once the project reached an incredible 100,810ft , the weather balloon popped , causing it to fall at incredible speeds back down to earth			2
after an automated parachute was deployed , the artwork touched down about 2 hours after it had been launched			0
@entity10 was able to track the artwork because he added a tracker to the payload			1
@entity10 examines his art project after it had crashed down to earth he said : ' within the payload we had a tracker which allowed us to track it using radio telemetry			1
after we launched it , we kept on having it relay data back to the computer and that allowed us to see where it was in relation to the car			0
' he continued : ' we drove about 40 miles north to find it			0
the tracker worked so well that within 15 minutes of it landing we had picked it back up			0
' i 'd like to exhibit it in an art gallery somewhere , purely for others to see it and for it to hopefully inspire others to be creative			2
' the budding entrepreneur 's artwork was created right on the edge of the @entity74 's atmosphere ' i 'd like to exhibit it in an art gallery somewhere , purely for others to see it and for it to hopefully inspire others to be creative			1
' in 2011 , @entity10 completed a project which saw him send a camera up into space to record the curvature of the @entity74			1
@entity10 's next project , which was a challenge laid down for him on social networking site @entity129 by @entity132 boss @entity131 , is to discover the depths of the ocean .			1

@entity10 , 22 , hopes to exhibit his work in a gallery
he also hopes to take on @entity131 's ocean depths discovery challenge as his next project
