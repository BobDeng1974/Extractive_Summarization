when their older brother @entity3 died in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 did what loyal brothers and soldiers do			1
they stood solemnly in uniform at his memorial , laid red roses in front of his picture , and @entity5 spoke bravely to a chapel full of loved ones who came to mourn			1
soldiers themselves , @entity5 and @entity6 knew what their fallen brother had experienced and seen			1
they knew the difficulties of being a warrior and a devoted husband , and what a testament it was to @entity3 's character that he had excelled at both			1
@entity25 : from left , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity26 , deep in conversation			1
@entity5 and @entity3 died while serving their country in @entity4 ' @entity3 , i miss you and i love you , brother , ' @entity5 said			1
' and see you again			1
' two years later , @entity5 died at a hospital in @entity35 after an insurgent attack left him with injuries that first cost him his legs , then his life			1
he was 34 , a year younger than @entity3 was when a suicide bomber killed him at a @entity42 base where he was working as a defense contractor			1
for a family that had already paid the highest price of war , it was time for another funeral , another eulogy , another grave			1
the eldest @entity6 boys are two of the thousands of @entity54 who have died since the conflicts in @entity57 and @entity4 began			1
but they share a link that most do not : they were brothers			1
' they laid down their lives , both of them , so that others could live , ' their mother , @entity60 , said			1
@entity3 , @entity5 and @entity6 played with soldiers long before they became soldiers themselves			1
devastating loss : the @entity6 family in @entity69 , @entity70			1
mother @entity60 ( right ) poses with her children , from left , @entity6 , @entity73 , @entity5 and @entity3 playtime was something of a battlefield rehearsal			1
when the @entity79 were idle , their toys morphed into land mines , waiting to be stepped on in the carpet at the family 's home in southern @entity70			1
the three @entity6 boys and their sister , @entity73 , grew up in a small town called @entity87			1
it was n't a far drive from the country , where their father , @entity91 , taught the boys to hunt squirrels and deer when he was n't treating patients as an ear , nose and throat doctor			1
the house was always full of something : the smell of mom 's venison fried up with lemon pepper , the sound of the kids riffing on guitars or banging on drums			1
amid the chaos , though , was harmony			2
a friend once asked why they did n't have cable			2
@entity5 looked at him and said : ' we 've got each other			2
' at night , when @entity6 was tucked into bed , the big kids would have story time			2
@entity5 and @entity73 would sit with legs crossed and listen to @entity3 , who even as a teenager , saw himself as a protector : sword in hand , clad in armor , crossing bridges to battle monsters with glowing eyes and yellow breath			2
hero : army sgt @entity132 died on january 15 , 2012 , in a hospital in @entity35 after being wounded in @entity4 courage : @entity135 on the cover of a video of his 2009 memorial service and a newspaper obituary kept by his sister in @entity141 , @entity70 ' in the story , of course , he 's always the hero , ' their sister @entity142 said			1
as they grew older , military dreams turned into career plans			2
@entity5 aired his by the time he was in sunday school			2
most of his classmates raised their hands when a teacher asked what they wanted to do when they grew up			2
he got up from his seat and drew a picture of a soldier on the board			2
years later , in 2000 , he enlisted in the @entity158 - and then told his mother			1
' i was indignant because i was mommy and i thought he should talk with me , which i realize now was laughable , ' his mother said			2
@entity3 signed up next , dropping out of medical school to become a @entity163			2
the last to join the military was @entity6			2
determined to keep her last son out of harm 's way , his mother refused to cook for him for two weeks when he announced he was going to become a @entity169			2
pride : @entity6 in his @entity169 uniform - he lost two brothers in @entity4 ' i was just so mad because i wanted to protect him , ' @entity60 said			1
her protests did n't work			2
once the deployments began , they seemed constant			2
@entity6 shipped off to @entity4 for the first time in 2009			1
@entity5 had finished a deployment earlier that year and was preparing for another with his @entity181 unit in 2010			2
' one was always coming or two were there and one was home , ' their mother said			2
@entity3 had just retired as a @entity163 seal and was working as a defense contractor in @entity4			1
he thought he could spend more time with his family that way and still serve his country			2
when he was home in @entity195 , he played ninjas with his stepson , @entity197 , and hung around his wife , @entity198 , even if she was doing something as mundane as laundry			0
' he loved us almost suffocatingly so , ' she said			0
when he was working in @entity4 , @entity3 called home often and made the adventure sound like a vacation			1
he talked about the food , the hotels - not the danger			0
' he would n't tell me anything about it because he did n't want me to worry , ' his sister , @entity73 , said			0
the risk became real at the end of 2009 , when the @entity6 parents were celebrating the birth of @entity5 's baby boy in @entity216			1
amid the celebration , word came from overseas : a suicide bomber had killed @entity3 at a @entity42 base in @entity4			1
his family met his remains in @entity222 , @entity223			0
it was a cold , gray day and the family waited inside a bus that felt like a funeral parlor , @entity73 recalled			0
@entity5 took @entity73 's hand in his and they whispered memories about their brother			0
deployments were harder after that			0
@entity5 and @entity6 headed back overseas not long after the funeral			0
the war started wearing on @entity5 , a medic who repaired the wounds that men inflict on each other			0
he worried about his younger brother serving in another part of @entity4			1
' i was just so mad because i wanted to protect him			0
' @entity60 , mother ' ( @entity6 's ) heading home here in the next few days , which is a huge load off my mind , ' @entity5 wrote in a @entity247 message to a friend			0
he waited for his own homecoming			0
during his final deployment , @entity5 would tell his sister stories about his son , @entity252			0
then he would cut himself off , unable to talk about the baby boy he could n't hold in his arms			0
' the pain comes in when you have to think about home , think about the people you love and then just try to block it out ... for your family and for your fellow soldiers , ' @entity73 recalled him saying			0
he had faith that he would come home			0
so much faith that he turned down a friend 's offer to ship him a care package in december , telling him that he would be packing up by the time it arrived			0
the next month , an insurgent shot @entity5 after he and his fellow soldiers saved a number of women and children in @entity4			1
a medic unto the end , he helped tend to his own wounds before he was flown to a hospital in @entity35			1
@entity6 caught a flight and accompanied @entity5 's wife to the hospital , where she saw her husband for the last time			1
@entity5 fought to stay alive , even after doctors cut off his legs , even as his body failed , even as his organs started shutting down			0
he died on january 15 , shortly before his parents arrived to say goodbye			1
' we were crying and i said , '' it 's just you and me now , bro , ' " she said			0
' again , the family found themselves in the same chapel , the same veterans cemetery , to say @entity295 moved @entity3 's grave so that the brothers could lie @entity298 in @entity299 , @entity195			0
' to lose @entity3 was devastating , ' his widow , @entity198 , said			0
' to lose @entity5 was just ... you throw your hands up in the air			0
' each brother 's tombstone cites part of the @entity307			0
@entity3 's points to a chapter that 's often read at happier times : 1 @entity311			0
part of it reads : ' when i was a child , i talked like a child , i thought like a child , i reasoned like a child			0
when i became a man , i put the ways of childhood behind me			0
' the family still calls them boys			0
the youngest , @entity6 , is planning to move closer to @entity5 's family			0
later this year , his mother says , he 'll transfer from his base in @entity327 to one on the mainland			0
he 'll remain in the military , at least for now			0
he will not deploy for war again			0
though the @entity169 will not talk specifically about @entity6 's case , the military has policies in place to protect surviving sons like @entity6 and families like the @entity337			0
it 's rare for brothers to die in the same war , but not unheard of			0
one of the most famous cases of siblings dying in war is the five @entity345 brothers , who died together at sea during a battle in @entity348 @entity60 said the military assured her that @entity6 wo n't be sent into conflict again			1
their family has sacrificed enough .			0
