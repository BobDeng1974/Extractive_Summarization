@entity7 , the arch - federalist president of the @entity8 , faces a censure motion because of his alleged role in turning @entity11 into @entity4 ’s biggest tax haven when he was prime minister of the country			1
far - right and anti-eu @entity14 have managed to collect enough support for a motion of censure , which must be debated and voted on , possibly as soon as next week			1
the plan also has the support of @entity37 ’s @entity36			1
but a lack of support for the censure motion from other parties , less than a month after the @entity42 endorsed the appointment of @entity7 ’s 28 - strong executive team , makes it highly improbable that his critics will win the two - thirds majority required to force the @entity8 from office			1
the @entity42 has no power to sanction individual members of the executive			0
an alliance of @entity54 , including @entity36 and the @entity55 gathered 76 signatures to meet the threshold of 10 percent of the 751 - seat chamber to put the motion on the agenda			0

@entity25 , left , was @entity11 's prime minister for two decades and was responsible for the country 's controversial tax policies which are currently under investigation by the @entity8 ‘ it is intolerable that a person who has been responsible for aggressive tax avoidance policies serves as president of the @entity8 , ’ the motion read			1
mr @entity7 has said he wants a level playing field in corporate taxation			0
the censure motion , brought by parties that oppose @entity1 oversight over states , said ‘ tax sovereignty ’ was vital for competition but @entity11 ’s policies were not fair competition			2
eurosceptics won a bigger voice in parliament at elections in may amid growing disillusionment with economic austerity and perceived failures of @entity1 administration			0
