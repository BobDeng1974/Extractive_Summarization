by @entity0 @entity3 's controversial @entity2 artwork has sold for £ 2.2million to an anonymous buyer at @entity5 in @entity6 on tuesday night			1
before the auction , @entity7 said that she would like her controversial unmade bed artwork to stay in the @entity10 - but that she doubted this would be possible as there would be no - one who could afford it			1
@entity15 shortlisted @entity2 is a dishevelled monument to ' ladette ' culture , surrounded by used condoms , worn knickers , cigarette butts and vodka bottles			1
@entity7 was in the packed auction room as the work was sold , to applause from the crowd			1
@entity28 , who paid £ 150,000 in 2000 for @entity2 , one of the key works of the @entity39 movement , sold it to support the work of the @entity42			1
ahead of the sale , @entity7 , 50 , said she would prefer the work go on display rather than vanish into a private collection , but doubted anywhere could produce the necessary cash			1
she told the @entity49 : ' i feel kind of philosophical about it			2
the @entity52 really want it but they have n’t any money			2
no one has any money to buy it			2
' pricey : @entity7 revealed that she doubts any @entity10 galleries will be prepared to pay between £ 800,000 and £ 1.2million for the piece last week , she revealed how she is struck by flashbacks when she 's near the bed , the display of which she said ' changed people 's perceptions of art '			1
she said : ' this is a surreal experience			2
every time i 'm near the bed or install the bed i get flashbacks and recollections of when i first saw the bed , which was in my bedroom and that was 16 years ago			1
' when i made the bed today , i actually had to get in it and pull the duvet over me and push it back to make it feel real and look real			2
' even the smell and everything , it 's all still there for me			2
it 's very , very evocative			0
except it 's like waking up , i would n't say a nightmare , but definitely ... it 's really strange			0
' it 's now going on a different journey			0
i just hope it goes to a nice place			0
it 's helped me a lot			0
' @entity7 said reactions to the artwork , which she produced after a traumatic relationship breakdown , varied across the globe			1
up close : a close up of @entity3 's piece ' my bed ' which features cigarettes and used condoms she said : ' in @entity107 they were shocked by my dirty slippers but they stole some bloody knickers and some condoms '			1
' in @entity113 it was like , " yeah , we 've seen feminist art before , we 've done it already " , no fuss , just treated it like a regular artwork			0
' of course in the @entity10 , it just exploded with the @entity15			1
i still think it 's iconic			0
there was nothing in the world in art that has ever looked like this , that has ever been like this , it 's seminal			0
' it changed people 's perceptions of what art is and what art can be			0
that 's why it 's still really special to me			0
' if i could i would show this at my next exhibition			0
i still love it , i still stand by it and i made it 16 years ago			0
