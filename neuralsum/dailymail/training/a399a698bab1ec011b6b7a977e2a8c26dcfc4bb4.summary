@entity1 caretaker manager @entity0 has told @entity2 he should not be scared of giving the ball away			1
the former @entity5 winger was back in the @entity8 side 's line up on saturday for the first time since the middle of november			1
the 3 - 1 win over @entity12 was just his seventh start of the campaign - a poor return for a player who cost the @entity18 giants £ 700,000 when he moved from @entity19 in 2012			1
@entity2 made his first start for @entity1 in almost two months against @entity12 on saturday @entity0 - who picked up his first win as @entity23 boss since replacing @entity24 - admits the 25 - year - old has suffered a crisis of confidence after being reduced to the role of an impact sub for most of the season			1
but after seeing him impress against the @entity31 , @entity0 says @entity2 must be given the licence to take on defender - and reassured him he will not be criticised if he gives away possession			1
he said : ' @entity2 did well on saturday			1
he 's short on a bit of confidence but i told him to just go and express himself			0
' he 's a flair player			0
he ca n't be afraid to go and lose possession			2
he 's the type of boy who has to be allowed to do that			0
' as much as you would like him to keep it , that 's what they do - they entertain and try to take people on			2
he gets a wee bit more scope to do that than other people			0
' caretaker manager @entity0 says the winger should not be worried about losing possession meanwhile , @entity55 hopes his @entity8 equaliser will be enough for him to keep hold of his own starting slot			2
@entity0 made three changes to the team humiliated by last week 's 4 - 0 thrashing from @entity62			1
@entity63 - who had to be replaced after just half an hour in the capital as he flirted with a red card - was dropped to the bench along side @entity67 and @entity69			0
@entity70 , @entity2 and @entity55 were the men brought in to spice up @entity1 faltering season and the @entity74 frontman made the most of his chance after two games on the bench as he cancelled out @entity79 's shock opener for @entity12			1
@entity0 is looking to give the £ 700,000 signing renewed confidence as he returns to the @entity1 team @entity83 and @entity84 ensured @entity1 got the win which trims @entity5 ' @entity86 lead back to 13 points and now @entity55 hopes his part in a winning display will have been picked up by the interim manager			1
he said : ' you need games as a striker			0
i 'm sure the other front lads at the club will tell you they need a run of games just to find your match sharpness firstly , then to try and get your eye in with the goals			0
' it 's been frustrating for me personally			0
it was n't ideal starting the season with an operation			0
striker @entity55 , who scored in the win over @entity12 , hopes his goal will lead to more time on the pitch ' there are a lot of quality strikers at the club and i knew i had to be patient			2
but hopefully i did enough on saturday to give myself the opportunity to play the next game			0
' i 'm sure the manager will go with the team that he thinks has the best chance of beating @entity119 next week , so that is why it 's important at a club like @entity1 to take your chances when they come along			2

@entity0 handed @entity2 first start since november
@entity1 won 3 - 1 against @entity12 on saturday
@entity0 *insists* @entity2 must n't be scared of making *mistakes*
