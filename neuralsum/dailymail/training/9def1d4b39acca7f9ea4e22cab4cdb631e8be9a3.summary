the young @entity10 called @entity11 sniffed out the rusty explosive while out walking with her owner @entity12 at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
mr @entity12 initially thought that the device was a large stone			1
lucky escape : six - month - old @entity11 , pictured with owner @entity12 , found a 70 - year - old @entity8 grenade on the beach at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 dangerous : the rusty @entity8 grenade was probably left behind following a @entity24 training exercise whoch took place just up the shore at @entity27 , @entity16 disarmed : a bomb disposal crew took the grenade to a secluded part of the beach and carried out a controlled explosion on it but fortunately he soon realised that six - month - old @entity11 had found a 70 - year - old grenade and grabbed his dog to pull her to safety			1
the beach had to be evacuated and bomb disposal experts had to be called in to carry out a controlled explosion			1
mr @entity12 , 41 , said : ' @entity11 started sniffing something which looked like a very large brown stone			1
' it just did n't look right and it had distinct markings on that you do n't ever see on rocks or stones			0
' i had a closer look , because we are never quite sure what she is going to eat , and it resembled a hand grenade from the @entity8			0
nerves of steel : two bomb disposal experts prepare to detonate the grenade yesterday ' it looked like the sort of thing you see in the old war movies			1
curious : the puppy found what mr @entity12 initially thought was a large brown stone , but he soon realised what the object was and pulled @entity11 away to safety he added : ' i pulled @entity11 back and put a pile of stones there because the tide was lapping over it			1
it looked rusty and there was an oily film around it			0
' fortunately there were n't many people around			0
if it had been the summer with kids playing down here then you dread to think what might have happened			0
' @entity11 is very lucky she did n't try to eat it			0
' mr @entity12 , from @entity15 , remained at the scene until police arrived to warn other people about the grenade yesterday morning			2
police and beach wardens cordoned off a 250 metres long section of the beach			0
a @entity98 bomb squad from @entity99 , @entity100 , arrived in the afternoon , moved the grenade to an isolated part of the beach and blew it up			2
a @entity16 police spokesman said the grenade was ' very old and heavily corroded '			2
