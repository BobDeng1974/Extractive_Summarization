@entity0 received plenty of criticism when he switched club manufacturers almost two years ago and he has now conceded that it took nearly 12 months to feel totally at ease with his new equipment			1
the @entity7 was flying high at the top of the world rankings when he signed a 10 - year contract with @entity10 in january 2013 that , according to media reports , was worth $ 250 million			1
a host of fellow golfers and media pundits lined up to tell @entity0 he was taking a gamble with his career and he went through a torrid time before ending a 12 - month title drought by landing the @entity19 crown at the end of the year			1
@entity0 celebrates after winning the @entity21 at @entity22 in august @entity0 poses with the @entity24 's race to @entity26 trophy in @entity26 in november @entity0 has not looked back since and an outstanding 2014 season yielded two major triumphs , a @entity30 win , victory in the @entity24 's flagship event , a memorable @entity34 display and a return to the no. 1 spot in the rankings			1
' the @entity40 win at the end of a very lean 2013 was a welcome bit of form , ' the 25 - year - old said			2
' it was the coming together of some hard work on many aspects of my game and becoming completely comfortable with the club changes i 'd made			0
' i then had the confidence to get the job done			0
i 'd say it was worth the wait to get things properly in place			0
' the major wins were really a continuation of that process			0
and , of course , hugely important , satisfying and evidence that i could win majors when i had to dig deep , rather than by comfortable margins , ' said @entity0 who has been voted the 2014 @entity64			1
' but do n't get me wrong			0
i 've nothing against a comfortable margin			0
' @entity0 's first two major triumphs , in the @entity68 and 2012 @entity21 , were both runaway eight - shot victories			1
@entity0 ( left ) celebrates @entity71 's @entity34 victory alongside team - mate @entity72 @entity0 also won the @entity21 at @entity73 in 2014 , the @entity24 's flagship event his third and fourth major wins , achieved this year , were much tighter affairs			1
he won the @entity77 at @entity78 by two strokes in july and had only one shot to spare when he lifted his second @entity21 trophy , in @entity82 in august			2
@entity0 also had a stellar season in 2012 , winning five times around the world , but believes he is a much more mature player these days			1
' two years on tour is quite a long time , even ( or especially ) as a 25 - year - old , ' he explained			1
' i also think my game and mental approach are in many ways linked			0
' with my swing , clubs and fitness in place , i feel confident enough to go out and win			2
' perhaps a lot of the maturity is just an extended learning curve , with each experience , good or bad , another lesson in patience , course management and knowing when , or when not , to take a risk			0
' @entity0 gave an exemplary exhibition of course management during @entity107 's victory over the @entity108 in @entity109 in september			1
pitting his wits against an in - form @entity111 in the final - day singles at @entity114 , he simply blew the @entity108 away with a performance that showed just why he is the world no. 1			0
@entity0 reeled off four birdies and an eagle in a stunning six - hole start and went on to record a 5 & 4 demolition job on a dazed @entity111			1
@entity0 poses with his two major trophies , the @entity21 and @entity77 ( right ) ' that was really down to a confidence thing , ' said the @entity7			2
' i 'd been playing really well , my swing was in great shape and i felt i knew what i needed to do to get a win on the board -- get off to a fast start			0
' the early birdies that day came as a result of some excellent driving , which effectively took any trouble out of the equation on the opening holes and allowed me relatively easy approaches			0
' i thought that if i was well under par by the turn i would be difficult to catch			0
' the quality of @entity0 's golf this year has helped him establish a sizeable lead over closest pursuers @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 and he will certainly be difficult to catch at the top of the rankings in 2015 .			2

@entity0 won two majors during a *breathtaking* 2014 campaign
he said a *barren* 2013 season was tough as he *adjusted* to @entity10 clubs
@entity0 feels he has matured a lot in the past two years out on tour
