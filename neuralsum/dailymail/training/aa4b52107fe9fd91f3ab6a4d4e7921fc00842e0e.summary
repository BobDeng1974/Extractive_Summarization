’ right on cue , the gold medallist sauntered onstage			0
‘ please tell them who won the 100m , ’ he said			2
‘ i did , ’ @entity37 deadpanned			2
during @entity148 with @entity133 , the head writer discussed the vice president and vice presidential candidate ’s varying strategies ahead of the debate			1
@entity133 said that while @entity5 prepared for thursday ’s debates by practicing foreign policy , ‘ @entity4 prepared by shotgunning @entity160 and watching @entity162 cartoon			1
in fairness , ’ he added , ‘ a bunch of stuff is the entire economic part of the @entity157 / @entity5 plan			2
’ he also jibbed @entity157 ’s shifting stance on abortion , conceding that the procedure was appropriate in cases of rape and incest			0
geek squad : @entity171 , far left , hosted a panel of tech editors to talk about the flaws of the @entity175 sob story : little did they know , their complaints were given to @entity181 ' peasant workers ' who had little sympathy for the editors ' problems @entity133 said that @entity157 still wants to be seen as a pro-life president , but he noted , ‘ @entity157 defines life as anyone making over $ 250,000 a year			0
’ @entity130 , played by @entity132 , joined @entity188 to talk about @entity52 ’s much - talked about performance as moderator			1
