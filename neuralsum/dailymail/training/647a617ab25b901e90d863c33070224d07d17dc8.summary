by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 @entity3 and his wife @entity4 have received the go - ahead to raze their @entity7 beachfront house and build an 11,000 - square - foot mansion			1
the @entity10 voted today to allow the couple to demolish the 3,000 - square - foot beach house for which they paid $ 12 million in 2008 in order to build the much larger home			1
it is the second time the couple has won permission to build the mansion after a neighbor challenged the original permit for the @entity23 ' plan for a two - storey home with a 4,500 - square - foot basement			1
future construction site : @entity3 's beachfront mansion in @entity7 , @entity28 , abuts a public beach more than double : the construction will include a complete destruction of the current home ( which has red tiling on the roof ) so that it can be rebuilt at nearly triple the size according to the @entity38 , @entity37 claimed the @entity23 lied about the size of their land in order to increase the allowable size of their house			1
according to @entity37 , the @entity23 included the beach - front area west of their seawall , adding 6,000 - square feet to their lot size and allowing them to build a house 1,000 - square - feet bigger than would have been allowed by @entity50 city guidelines			1
@entity10 documents state that @entity37 also claimed that public beach use was not protected ; that the scale of the development would be out of character with its surrounds ; and that the home would be threatened by geologic risks , block public access and impact water quality			0
the panel voted seven - four in favor of the @entity23			1
the @entity38 reports that two commissioners , @entity65 and @entity66 , who voted against the project agreed with @entity37 , saying the sandy beach should n't have been included in the calculation of the home 's size			1
@entity66 said she was ' flummoxed ' and called it a ' huge red flag , and an unacceptable premise			0
' @entity50 ’s planning regulations , she said , ' clearly prohibit counting other kinds of unbuildable areas such as canyons and gullies			2
' new project : the @entity23 plan to build a beachfront mansion in @entity50 big enough to accommodate their children and grandchildren @entity65 said the description of the lower level of the house as a basement was misleading			1
' if you ’re standing on the beach … you are going to see @entity91 doors or sliding glass doors of a first floor that they call a " basement			0
" we have to define what we really mean as a " basement " on a hillside lot , ' she said			0
the 65 - year - old former governor is looking to make the home into an 11,000 - square - foot house that is more comfortable for the large brood of @entity3 children and grandchildren attorney @entity107 who represents the couple , said the @entity23 will begin work on the house in about six months time , and that the project is expected to take between 14 and 16 months			1
as a condition of the permit , the @entity23 are required to dedicate their beachfront area to public use			2
commissioner @entity116 told @entity117 the project would be ' very compatible with the development that 's in that neighborhood			0
' ' it 's not going to be intrusive or blocking the views that people have right now , ' he said			0
' these people have played by the rules			0
' the 75 - year - old house , which has two bedrooms , will be replaced with a two - storey dwelling			2
low - key : @entity3 has made very few public appearances since his failed election bid but did make a day trip to @entity133 ( pictured ) ‘ they will keep the appearance of the home from the street as a single - story residence			1
it wo n't look tall and bulky like some of their immediate neighbor 's homes , ’ the @entity3 ’s lawyer @entity134 told the @entity135			2
the plans reveal that as well as altering the house , the driveway will be relocated			2
the existing lap pool and spa at the home , which has a lawn running down the white sand beach , will be retained			0
the most outlandish feature of the home will be in the garage , as mr @entity3 ordered a $ 55,000 car elevator so that vehicles can be stored below ground			2
during @entity3 's 2012 election campaign , the revelation that the plans for the home included such a contraption - which stars such as @entity162 and @entity163 also have - came as a point of ridicule			1
' well , does n’t everyone need an elevator for their cars ? even if you have to hire a lobbyist to secure it ? ' quipped @entity174 , a spokesman for the @entity175			0
unassuming entrance : @entity3 came under fire during the campaign as it was revealed that he wants to commission a $ 55,000 car elevator in the garage the @entity7 home , which sits on 0.41 acres , is one of the family ’s three homes			1
the @entity23 ' official primary residence is a townhouse outside of @entity187			0
they also own a $ 10 million vacation home on the shore of @entity190 in @entity191			0
the couple sold the 6,400 - square - foot home in @entity194 , @entity195 where they raised their children , in 2009 for $ 3.5 million			1
in addition , their 9,500 - square - foot ski lodge in @entity199 , @entity200 , fetched $ 5.25 million last year			1
changes : the construction plans promise that the exterior of the house will not change dramatically @entity3 and @entity206 are believed to be worth between $ 190 million and $ 264 million			1
he made much of his fortune as the co-founder of private equity firm @entity209			0
at a book signing last year , @entity3 told reporters why he bought his @entity28 beachfront house			2
' i wanted to be where i could hear the waves , ' he said			0
' as a boy , we spent summers on @entity218 and i could hear the crashing waves at night			0
' it was one of my favorite things in the world			0
being near the water and the waves was something i badly wanted to experience again			0

@entity3 and @entity206 have won *approval* for plans to build an 11,000 - square - foot mansion
the house would replace a 3,000 - square foot beach house currently on the @entity7 , @entity50 property
a neighbor challenged the @entity23 ' plans , but commissioners voted in favor of the @entity23 seven - to - four
