by @entity0 for @entity1 a woman needed hospital treatment after screaming so hard doing the ice bucket challenge she dislocated her jaw			1
@entity6 , 20 , was taken to @entity7 to have her jaw put back into place when the internet craze for tipping cold water over yourself went painfully wrong last week			1
her video has now been shared more than 1,000 times on @entity14 after the challenge left her in agony			1
' i tried to close my mouth but it would not close , it was locked , and then i came to the realisation that something was up			0
' then my mum and sister came to the realisation and they started laughing , but i had to be rushed to hospital			0
' the shop worker had been celebrating her mother 's birthday before deciding to take on the challenge			2
@entity6 's 47 - second video shows her thanking a friend for nominating her before nominating several friends and family			1
her step - father , @entity47 , 44 , then pours the bucket over her			2
@entity6 screams twice after she is splashed with the icy water and then realises that her jaw wo n't move			1
as she approaches the camera , the extent of the dislocation can be seen , as her face appears to have be stuck in a painful position			0
two doctors later managed to click her jaw back into place			2
like millions of others around the world , she accepted the challenge to raise money for a @entity63 charity @entity6 's mother , @entity64 , 44 , who filmed the challenge , said : ' we were in the waiting room and everyone was laughing , they thought it was hilarious			1
' the two doctors who put it back in place had heard about her before they saw her , and then when we went up to x-ray they were already laughing about it as well			0
' @entity6 has taken it so well			2
at the time when it happened even i was laughing because you just do n't expect anything bad to happen when you are doing something light hearted like that			0
' but i think people should know that it can be quite dangerous			0
' @entity6 added : ' everyone has been saying it is really funny and it has been shared more than 1,000 times on @entity14			1
' as soon as it was clicked back into place it felt fine			0
it could have been a lot worse i guess			0
' but after she was doused in cold water , was walked away in pain having dislocated her jaw by screaming the 20 - year - old sees the funny side though and says she is glad she has helped raise money for good cause she added : ' you see all these videos all over @entity14 and stuff but you would never in a million years think something like that would happen			1
the next morning when i woke up it was a bit sore but other than that it has been fine			0
' i 've been told i 've got to only have liquid food for two weeks though , so it 's a lot of soup for me at the moment			0
' the @entity116 trend was started to raise awareness for @entity118 - the @entity120 abbreviation for @entity63			2
it sees participants pour ice and water over themselves before asking other friends to do the same and encouraging them to donate to charity			1
@entity6 donated £ 5 to the @entity127 after she was nominated and the charity announced on friday that it has raised an amazing £ 75million in the last month through the online initiative .			1

@entity6 took on the ice bucket challenge after birthday party
her video starts as millions of others do , with her accepting nomination
but after she gets *freezing* water over her head she walks away in pain
she later discovered she dislocated her jaw by screaming so *strongly*
the 20 - year - old has seen the funny side and given money to charity
