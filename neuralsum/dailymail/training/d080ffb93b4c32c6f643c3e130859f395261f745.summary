by @entity0 @entity1 hopes to see @entity2 back in action soon			1
@entity2 was sent home early from the @entity5 in shame after biting @entity7 in @entity9 's group stage win over @entity10			1
given that it was the third time he had bitten a fellow professional , @entity12 's disciplinary committee banned the @entity16 forward from ' all football - related activity ' for four months			1
the @entity12 president felt sorry to lose @entity2 early from the tournament , and he hopes the @entity9 striker will be ready and determined to represent his country again soon			1
' as a footballer i feel with him that such a punishment ... it hurts , it hurts , ' @entity1 said at his final press conference in @entity41			1
' but as @entity12 president i have to accept the decisions that are taken by our independent committees			1
' i do hope that this player will come back to football because on the pitch what he has shown so far ... i have seen his capacity technically and tactically to do what he can do - his smelling of the goal ... i do hope he will be back , he is now in one of the greatest clubs in the world			1
' prior to the @entity5 there were serious fears about security , transport and stadia , but @entity1 thinks @entity62 2014 passed the test with flying colours			1

@entity104 's run to the quarter - finals was a genuine good news story , @entity102 also surprised a few by reaching the same stage while @entity109 , @entity65 and @entity110 also won many admirers			1
but the biggest shocks came between the heavyweights of world football			2
@entity116 's 7 - 1 annihilation of @entity62 will go down as one of the biggest shocks in @entity5 history			2
leading the way : @entity121 scores the first goal for @entity116 during their 7 - 1 win over @entity62 lethal : @entity126 scores for @entity116 as @entity62 midfielder @entity127 watches on but for @entity1 , the highlight was @entity130 's stunning 5 - 1 victory over 2010 champions @entity131			1
' when i saw that match , especially in the second - half , then i felt this was going to be something special , ' he said			0
' what makes this @entity5 very special this time is the quality of the football , the intensity of the games			0
' in the first phase teams tend to not to want to lose matches			0
they used to absorb and not want to lose but this time it was : " boom , boom "			0
it started with aggressive , offensive football and this has been the case the whole through to the end of competition			0
' @entity156 was exceptional and the bar has been set very high for @entity21 to match the same quality			0
' double trouble : @entity160 scores @entity130 's second goal during their 5 - 1 win over @entity131 all smiles : @entity160 ( left ) and @entity165 enjoy @entity130 's 5 - 1 win over @entity131 on the whole , @entity1 's final address was an upbeat one			1
the @entity12 president brushed off the fact that he was booed at several grounds around the country			1
' if you are in this business you have to live with that , ' he said			0
but @entity1 did snap at one female reporter when it was put to him that @entity12 was corrupt			1
' listen lady , when you speak about corruption then you have to present evidence , ' he said			0
