mr @entity7 , 56 , says he has been receiving calls to his @entity6 @entity24 firm from hundreds of concerned residents he said : ' it is legal			1
foxes do n’t have the same protection as , say , a badger			0
i always let the police know when i ’m going to shoot a fox			1
i have a firearms certificate as well			0
' this has nothing whatsoever to do with fox hunting			0
' they ’re urban foxes so it ’s completely different			1
you ’re not going to get a bunch of hounds running through a @entity44 suburb			0

he is also on the police call out system to humanely deal with deer or other animals injured in road traffic collisions			2

mr @entity7 , who defra contacts to kill animals humanely during disease outbreaks , says he always notifies the police when he is going to shoot a fox and insists his work is legal the grandfather added : ' i quite like foxes really			1
in the countryside they do n’t do much harm			0
but they are not welcome in cities			0
' animal rights campaigners say that 50 per cent of young foxes are killed on the roads , and that is enough of a cull , but i think that ’s ridiculous			2
' it ’s crazy to rely on motorists to control any animal population - the damage to cars and potential loss of life is too great			2

if they were in danger of becoming extinct i would n’t kill them			0
' i would n’t like to be the one to kill the last remaining fox , put it that way			0
' a spokeswoman from the @entity119 said today : ' the @entity119 will always urge non-lethal methods of deterrent where possible as shooting foxes will simply encourage other foxes to move in from other areas and take their place ' the most sustainable and long - term solution to discourage foxes from an area is to remove or prevent access to the things that are attracting them to the area , such as food and shelter			1
' ' there are restrictions on some of the methods that might be used to kill them but otherwise foxes do not have specific legal protection			2
' providing that the person has the appropriate firearms certification for the weapon used , is on land that they either own or have permission to be on and is not shooting so as to pose a safety hazard then there is no offence committed			0
