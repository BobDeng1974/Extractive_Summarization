by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 25 september 2013 perched on railing with a can of lager in one hand and a cigarette in the other , this mother is hardly setting a shining example to children filing out of a nearby primary school			2
the unnamed woman must have found the stress of the 3pm school run too hard to take as she swigged from the can while waiting opposite a man with a pram for her own child to come out of the school gates			1
the feckless mother was photographed by a furious fellow parent , also waiting outside @entity22 , in @entity23 , @entity24			1
bad example : a woman was spotted drinking from a can of lager outside a primary school in @entity23 , north east @entity24			1
she is thought to be a parent waiting to pick her child up he said : ' children being exposed to this kind of behaviour will start to believe it is acceptable if something is n't done to stop this in the future			0
' is n't it an offence to drink in public at this time ? ' the photograph also drew the condemnation of the school 's headteacher @entity45 who said she has since spoken to the parents involved			1
she said : ' clearly this is not the sort of thing we want to see outside the school ; it is not a good example			2
it is the first time this has happened			0
i have spoken to the parents about it and have had a positive response			2
' if there are any more reports like this , i shall be speaking to the @entity64 for the area			0
' mrs @entity45 highlighted the rules for parents dropping off and collecting children from the school , adding : ' i do not allow smoking on our site and i have a code of conduct for parents because they come into the school			1
' there is a level of behaviour which is not accepted			0
we do not allow smoking and there is no shouting or swearing or physical abuse and parents are not allowed to come in under the influence of drink or drugs			2
' @entity24 councillor @entity89 , said that the mother 's behaviour sends out the wrong kind of message to children at the school			1
the feckless mother was photographed by a furious fellow parent , also waiting outside @entity22 , in @entity23 , @entity24 he said : ' we do nâ€™t like to dictate to parents about smoking and drinking , but they have to be reasonable where they do it			1
' we are always trying to promote healthy lifestyles , particularly with children			0
' drinking in public , which we see a lot of on the @entity110 , is a difficult issue			0
' all we can do is try to discourage people because it sends out the wrong message to young people that it is somehow socially acceptable			0
' the woman was pictured as the @entity117 launched a campaign against drinking in public and related antisocial behaviour			1
the organisation says that 50 per cent of all violent crime is alcohol related , with half of domestic violence incidents and around a third of child abuse cases involving offenders who are under the influence of alcohol			0
as part of the nationwide campaign , @entity23 police officers will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the photo taken outside @entity22 and intend to name and shame those who drink irresponsibly in the town			1
police and @entity140 for @entity141 , @entity142 , said : ' the clear message has to be that those who drink too much need to take responsibility for their own actions and this is something i will be working to address			0
' in the cold light of day , many of the people i have seen behaving badly because of drink should feel embarrassed by their actions , and we must find ways to ensure the embarrassment lasts longer than the hangover			0
