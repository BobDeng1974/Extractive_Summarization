@entity0 is scoring goals at a ratio of more than two - a - game as he goes into this week 's @entity5 match with @entity6 at @entity7			1
after a brace in a comfortable 5 - 0 away win against @entity9 he moved to 15 goals in seven league games – it 's a record start to the season in the @entity15 league and it gives him a better scoring average than most teams in @entity19			1
he will score over 70 this season if he continues at his current rate			0
@entity22 made light work of @entity9			2
@entity24 will be a far tougher test but @entity26 's team are starting to resemble the side that won last season 's @entity5			0
@entity22 forward @entity0 celebrates scoring first goal against @entity9 on saturday afternoon @entity22 : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 73 ) , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 79 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 68 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity0 subs not used : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity35 , @entity40 , @entity38 , @entity47 goals : @entity0 13 ( pen ) , 61 , @entity42 38 , @entity36 66 , @entity41 82 ref : @entity50 att : 23,506 @entity22 were without an under - the - weather @entity52 and the injured @entity54			1
@entity45 watched the game from the bench and @entity37 hobbled off with a bruised foot in the second half			0
if all four are fit to play against @entity6 the @entity22 coach 's most difficult job will be to decide who to leave out			2
@entity9 came into the game not having scored at home yet this season but they have a habit of making life very difficult for @entity22 and might have fancied their chances against an injury and illness - affected opposition			1
but @entity26 had said in the week that naming @entity0 in his starting @entity71 is worth a goal start for his team and so it proved again			0
@entity0 almost scored inside the first two minutes when found with a long ball out of defence from @entity37 but he shot uncharacteristically wide of the target			2
@entity22 's talisman does n't need three chances to score and with his second opportunity from the spot he shot past @entity82 to make it 1 - 0			2
@entity0 , @entity42 and @entity84 were all on the scoresheet against @entity9 on saturday @entity86 ca n't hide his disappointment as of @entity9 are thrashed at home @entity0 takes on @entity9 defenders @entity90 ( right ) and @entity91 ( left ) at the @entity93 stadium in @entity94 @entity22 's @entity0 ( @entity95 ) skips away from @entity9 defender @entity90 during saturday 's @entity97 clash it was not his most convincing penalty but it went through the keeper 's hands			1
the spot - kick award had also been slightly dubious			0
@entity42 went down in the area under a challenge from @entity91 who protested vehemently that he had got the ball not the man			0
it was @entity0 's 14th goal in eight league games – something no - one had done at the start of a season in @entity15 since @entity115 's @entity114 in the 1943 season			1
@entity91 was booked for the foul that led to the penalty and so was @entity119 when he up - ended @entity0 under the referee 's nose moments later			2
@entity37 forced @entity82 into a fine save with a vicious shot from the edge of the area and from @entity22 's next attack they did double their lead			0
@entity84 crossed from the right and @entity42 headed down and beyond @entity82 for his third goal of the season			0
@entity130 ( left ) of @entity9 is tackled by @entity22 defender @entity34 @entity130 ( left ) of @entity9 is tackled by @entity131 during the @entity97 match for all the fire - power lost in midfield due to @entity45 's absence @entity22 had gained in balance with the extra natural midfielder and the @entity84 , @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity41 quartet was in complete control of the game for @entity22			1
the later was particularly outstanding and will feel justifiably hard done by when he is left out for the returning @entity45 on wednesday			0
it was @entity41 who started the move that led to the third goal scored by @entity0 , who cut in from the left , ghosting past @entity91 before burying a shot past @entity82 for his 15th goal of the season			1
@entity9 had long since accepted their fate and @entity39 was allowed to look up and pick his pass for the spectacular fourth goal scored by @entity84 , who collected the floated assist on his chest before volleying home			2
the brilliant @entity41 rifled in a glorious fifth to mean @entity22 have now won their last five league games , scoring 25 goals and conceding only three			1
' we are in great form going to @entity7 , ' said the midfielder			0
