@entity0 vowed to continue the fight for control of @entity3 on thursday night as he broke his silence on the £ 16million bail - out put forward by his alliance of investors			1
the @entity9 - based businessman has flown home from the @entity11 without an agreement in place but is adamant that does n't mean his plan is dead			1
@entity0 expressed frustration with aspects of the process since arriving in the @entity11 to meet @entity20 directors nine days ago			1
@entity0 ( centre ) is still yet to broker a deal for him to take control of a 51 per cent stake at @entity3 @entity3 striker @entity25 in action during the @entity20 side 's cup win at @entity29 on tuesday night chief among those has been @entity32 — regarded as the main rival for the @entity20 throne — snubbing a request for talks			1
@entity0 questioned @entity32 's motives as he alluded to reports the @entity40 owner had sought control over @entity3 trademarks during previous discussions about a loan			1
the former club director held talks with @entity47 on wednesday but did not reach an accord with the man who holds voting rights over a 26 per cent stake in the club , providing the power of veto over a new share issue			1
however , @entity0 provided @entity56 with further information about his group 's plan yesterday and insisted he would not back off			2
' we have a lot of work to do over the next few months to regain the club , ' he said			2
' i would not be here without the support of the fans and neither would my co-investors			0
we are going to need to draw on your support again over the coming months			0
' he added : ' over the last few weeks @entity72 , @entity73 and i have constructively engaged the @entity3 board and ( at the request of the board ) @entity47 regarding our proposal to invest £ 16million into the club as soon as is practically possible			1
' when investing in any public company , there are numerous regulatory and compliance requirements that have to be dealt with			0
there are also @entity85 compliance issues that arise when investing in a football club in @entity87			2
@entity32 ( centre ) , seen here pictured at @entity40 's game against @entity90 , has snubbed any request for talks with @entity0 so far over owning a percentage of the @entity20 club ' an obvious further complication in @entity3 ' case is the seeming lack of authority of the board to make decisions without reference to key shareholders who appear to be ' the power behind the throne '			1
' prior to commencing the implementation issues referred to above , it is necessary to reach an in - principle agreement with the board that can then be put to shareholders			0
' in this regard , it is important to recognise that the so - called @entity111 represents more than 25 per cent of the shares in issue and could therefore block the implementation of our proposal even if recommended by the board			2
' likewise , a combination of other shareholders could veto our proposal			0
i attempted to meet with mr @entity32 on my visit but neither he , nor his colleague , @entity32 [ @entity122 ] @entity121 , acknowledged my request for a meeting			0
this is their right but it is unfortunate given the concerns from supporters that mr @entity32 is using his shareholder status to put pressure on the board to alienate the rights and trademark of the club in favour of his personal interest			2
' i will make a separate announcement and appeal to fans on this topic at the appropriate time			2
' @entity142 revealed earlier this month that the @entity0 group were planning a £ 16million investment in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue			1
@entity47 ( left ) has held discussions with @entity0 over his 26 per cent stake at the club that initial proposal has been modified to contain a loan element that addresses the fact the club may run out of cash before any share issue could take place			1
the cash input , however , will only happen if the @entity0 group gain effective control of the boardroom			1
' our initial proposal to the board was to invest the full £ 16million by way of equity at 20p per share , ' said @entity0			1
' the board requested that we consider a debt / equity mix that would reduce dilution for existing shareholders and allow the debt component to be advanced prior to the extended time frame required for the approval of additional equity			0
' we are amenable to this and to working with the board on the mechanics necessary to ensure that this is achieved , provided the full investment is recognised by way of board representation			0
' we wish to appoint an equal number of members to the board and have the key say regarding the appointment of the chairperson			0
' we will not invest funds and let the existing board determine how these funds are spent			0
that has not worked well in the past			0
' the board has apparently engaged constructively on our proposal while advancing its own points as to what it believes is in the best interest of the club and its shareholders			2
' @entity47 has similarly apparently engaged constructively , including highlighting some concerns			0
i have today responded to these concerns in writing			0

the fight for control continues to be a huge topic of debate at @entity3
@entity0 has broke his silence on the current issue
the former @entity3 director is keen to strike a £ 16million deal where he would then acquire a 51 per cent stake at the club
however , after *flying* in from @entity9 to discuss a potential deal he has now returned home after *unsuccessful* talks
