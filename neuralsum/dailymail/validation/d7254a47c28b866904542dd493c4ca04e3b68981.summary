three crew members have safely returned to @entity1 after spending 167 days on the @entity2			1
they returned in a @entity4 capsule , landing southeast of the town of @entity6 in @entity7 at 2.07am gmt ( 8.07am local time ) this morning			1
one the @entity2 three crew members remain , and another three will join on 27 march - including two who will become the first to spend a year continuously on the station			1
the @entity18 ( shown ) took slightly more than three hours to return after leaving the iss. this stunning image was taken from a helicopter as the capsule parachuted back to the ground by @entity24 photographer @entity23 this landing brought to an end @entity26 , carrying with it commander @entity29 of @entity24 and flight engineers @entity30 and @entity32 of the @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1
@entity32 was the first @entity34 female cosmonaut to work on the station in two decades construction of the @entity2 began on 20 november 1998			1
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			2
it completes an orbit of @entity1 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity1 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
the @entity18 spacecraft , which brought them back to @entity1 , departed from the space station at 10.44pm gmt on wednesday			1
it took them just over three hours to return			0
' we wish you a good flight and a soft landing , ' the remaining crew on the @entity2 said to the departing crew			2
after a few hours of free flight , the @entity4 burned its engine for four minutes and 41 seconds , reducing its velocity enough for it to plummet through the atmosphere , with the crew module separating from the other superfluous sections			2
once through the atmosphere , a parachute deployed and brought the @entity4 to a relatively gentle - but still quite bumpy - landing on the ground			0
extracted from the capsule , which was charred on re-entry , the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks , bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures			0
' everything is great , thank you			0
the guys are great and worked very well , ' said a smiling @entity32 while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure			0
' congratulations on the recent holiday , ' a rescue and recovery team officer said to @entity32 , referring to the @entity91 marked on 8 march			0
i am drinking real tea with lemon , ' @entity30 said with a smile			0
' i am glad to be here , ' @entity29 said in @entity34 before the three got into all - terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area			1
this landing brought to an end @entity26 , bringing with it commander @entity104 ( right ) of @entity24 and flight engineers @entity30 ( middle ) and @entity32 ( left ) of the @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1

the guys are great and worked very well , ' said a smiling @entity32 , pictured here , while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure the soyuz capsule landed 91 miles ( 146km ) southeast of the town of @entity6 , or @entity6 , in @entity7 at 2.07am gmt ' everything is fine			1
i am drinking real tea with lemon , ' @entity30 , pictured , said with a smile after the landing while on the station , the crew participated in a variety of research focusing on the effects of microgravity on cells , @entity1 observation , physical science and biological and molecular science			2
one of several key research focus areas during @entity26 was human health management for long - duration space travel , as @entity24 and @entity33 prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station			1
on 27 march , @entity24 astronaut @entity152 and @entity33 cosmonaut @entity153 will undertake the first year - long stay aboard the @entity2 , to prepare astronauts for long - duration missions to @entity157			1
the mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously , crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to @entity1			1
expedition 42 also tested the @entity166 ( @entity167 ) , which provides data to improve scientists ' understanding of the structure and evolution of @entity1 's atmosphere			0
this may lead to enhancements to spacecraft launches , landings and communications systems ; help guide future atmospheric investigations of @entity157 , @entity180 or other worlds ; and help researchers model and predict climate changes on @entity1			0
the station crew also welcomed three cargo spacecraft with several tons of scientific investigations , food , fuel and other supplies			2

construction of the @entity2 ( shown ) began on 20 november 1998			0
it supports a crew of up to six ay any one time , with crews split into groups of three			0
it has been continuously manned since 2 november 2000 the @entity18 spacecraft is seen as it lands with the expedition 42 crew near the town of @entity6 , @entity7 today			1
the crew returned after almost six months onboard the @entity2 where they served as members of the @entity208 and 42 crews a fleet of ground vehicles and aircraft , such as the helicopter in the distance , are used to secure the @entity4 and rescue the crew when it lands after a brief rest , the three got into all - terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area pictured from left to right in this photo of the entire expedition 42 crew are @entity32 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity193 in january , the trio helped grapple and connect a @entity227 spacecraft on the company 's fifth contracted commercial resupply mission to the station			1
@entity231 returned to @entity1 in february with critical science samples			0
two @entity34 @entity234 cargo craft docked to the station in october and february , while the fifth and final @entity237 @entity236 ( @entity236 ) , bearing the name of @entity240 physicist @entity239 , considered the father of the @entity243 theory , departed the station in february			2
during his time on the orbital complex , @entity29 ventured outside the space station with @entity24 astronaut @entity224 on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future @entity250 commercial crew spacecraft			1
@entity29 also completed a spacewalk in october with fellow @entity24 astronaut @entity252 to replace a failed voltage regulator			2
@entity30 conducted one spacewalk during his time in space			2
during his time on the orbital complex , @entity29 ventured outside the space station ( pictured ) with @entity24 astronaut @entity224 on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future @entity250 commercial crew spacecraft having completed his second space station mission , @entity30 now has spent 331 days in space			1
@entity29 , having previously flown as a shuttle pilot on @entity262 , has spent 178 days in space			2
@entity32 spent 167 days in space on this , her first flight			2
@entity267 currently is operating the station , with @entity269 in command			0
flight engineers @entity223 of @entity33 and @entity193 of @entity272 are continuing station research and operations until their three new crewmates arrive in two weeks			1
on 27 march , @entity24 astronaut @entity152 ( left ) and @entity33 cosmonaut @entity153 ( right ) will undertake the first year - long stay aboard the @entity2 , to prepare astronauts for long - duration missions to @entity157			1

three astronauts have returned from the @entity2 after a six - month stay aboard the orbiting space station
the @entity18 took slightly more than three hours to land near the remote town of @entity6 in @entity7
it carried @entity29 of @entity24 and flight engineers @entity30 and @entity32 of @entity33
the landing brings to an end @entity26 aboard the station , where three crew members remain
later this year the first year - long stay on the station will be attempted by a @entity250 and @entity34 astronaut
