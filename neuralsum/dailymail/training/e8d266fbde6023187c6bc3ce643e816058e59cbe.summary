each month a new planet is discovered that bears similarities to our own - and it is becoming increasingly apparent @entity4 is not unique			0
so it stands to reason that of the billions of @entity4 - like planets in our galaxy alone , there might be another that hosts life			1
it ’s a thought that is gaining more credence all the time , and now @entity16 has released a fascinating book detailing how , or if , we might communicate with some of these worlds			1
a new book made for @entity16 called @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 details the methods through which we might communicate with aliens			1
although this artist 's illustration is a bit fanciful , the authors suggest that @entity4 may already have been visited some of the most interesting chapters tackle the issue of alien communication in the past , present and future			1
in one section , for example , @entity34 from the @entity35 considers the possibility that rock art on @entity4 is of extraterrestrial origin			0
‘ we can say little , if anything , about what these patterns signify , why they were cut into rocks , or who created them , ’ he writes			0
‘ for all intents and purposes , they might have been made by aliens			1
’ the book is titled @entity21			2
in 1959 , @entity56 physicists @entity54 and @entity57 published an article discussing the potential to use microwave radio to communicate between stars			0
a year later in 1960 , astronomer @entity62 conducted the first hunt for alien life with an 85 - foot ( 25 metres ) antenna in @entity66 , but after two months concedes defeat.in the 1960s , @entity67 performs extensive searches for @entity70 , again with no success			2
in the 1970s @entity16 began to take an interest in @entity73 , with the chances of success seemingly growing as technology advanced			1
in 1988 , @entity16 began sweeping surveys of the night sky for signals , but @entity80 terminated funding a few years later			0
the independent @entity81 , established in 1984 , took over the job			0
in 1992 the first planet outside the solar system is confirmed , an almost certainly uninhabitable world orbiting a pulsar			0
in 2009 @entity16 ’s kepler telescope launches and , over the next few years , finds hundreds of planets			2
and just last month , the first planet of a similar size to @entity4 and at the correct distance from its parent star to host water , called @entity94 186 - f , was found			0
it is the most likely place that has been found that could host life as we know it			2
it was edited for @entity16 by @entity99 , director of interstellar message composition at the @entity81			0
with the help of other experts he tackles a number of topics including the prospect of life on other planets and the means through which we might send or receive a message			1
@entity99 begins the 330 - page book by postulating how difficult it might be to make first contact			1
‘ if a radio signal is detected in a modern @entity73 experiment , we could well know that another intelligence exists , but not know what they are saying , ’ he writes in the book ’s introduction			1
he goes on to add : ‘ even if we detect a civilisation circling one of our nearest stellar neighbours , its signals will have traversed trillions of miles , reaching @entity4 after travelling for years			0
’ but , all hope is not lost – throughout the book @entity99 and his colleagues tackle these very problems , and provide solutions that may prove invaluable in the future			2
‘ to move beyond the mere detection of such intelligence , and to have any realistic chance of comprehending it , we can gain much from the lessons learned by researchers facing similar challenges on @entity4 , ’ he continues			2
‘ like archaeologists who reconstruct temporally distant civilisations from fragmentary evidence , @entity142 researchers will be expected to reconstruct distant civilisations separated from us by vast expanses of space as well as time			1
‘ as we attempt to decode and interpret extraterrestrial messages , we will be required to comprehend the mindset of a species that is radically other			2
’ rock art , an example in @entity155 pictured , is cited as one possible example of aliens visiting @entity4 before			0
ultimately , however , the authors detail some of the methods we might employ to search for alien life including scouring exoplanets for signs of civilisation elsewhere in the compendium the authors tackle the question of the possible biology , evolution and physics of an extraterrestrial race			1
@entity99 explains how the methods via which aliens communicate might be vastly different from our own , making contact difficult			1
he says that messaging through sound , as we are used to on @entity4 , might not be possible			0
‘ on the other hand , vision and the use of images would appear to be at least plausible , ’ he writes			0
the authors also detail way we could send messages of our own through methods such as @entity142 , using giant radio dishes like the @entity182 in @entity183 ( pictured )			1
they say their are immense challenges in making first contact , but we can learn lessons from the history of civilisations on @entity4 and , he adds , imaging the surface of habitable planets in the future might reveal ‘ the physical arrangement of objects ’ that suggests the presence of alien life			1
@entity34 suggests , for example , that ‘ an optical telescope of diameter 620 miles ( 1,000 miles ) could resolve an object of diameter one kilometre ( 0.62 miles ) at a distance of 100 light - years			0
’ @entity99 concludes his introduction with the monumental task awaiting scientists and scholars across the world , but highlights the importance of these studies and research			0
‘ these scholars are grappling with some of the enormous challenges that will face humanity if an information - rich signal emanating from another world is detected , ’ he writes			0
‘ by drawing on issues at the core of contemporary archaeology and anthropology , we can be much better prepared for contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation , should that day ever come			1

a new book details the @entity73 ( @entity142 )
in it the authors discuss the methods through which we might find aliens
these include searching for signs of life on planets or finding messages
the book details some of the challenges ahead for making first contact
but ultimately the authors say it is something that might happen one day
