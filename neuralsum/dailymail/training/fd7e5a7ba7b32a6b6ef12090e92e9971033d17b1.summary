’ he added : ‘ as we compete to win on the global stage , now is the right time to make a change , ’ implying that @entity3 ’s departure had been premeditated to make room for a new era at the brand			2
@entity4 serves as @entity19 ’s professional ware counterpart			2
it offers dressier alternatives to @entity19 ’s casual separates and @entity40 ’s ( also owned by the company ) bargain - priced basics			0
in the 90s @entity4 hit its stride with polished , well - made attire			0
more recently , it seems like its merchandise 's quality and designs have been heavily downgraded			0
last year , @entity4 contracted renowned designer @entity48 in an advisory position to work alongside @entity3 and help the retailer ‘ rev up its fashion offering , ’ writes @entity52			1
