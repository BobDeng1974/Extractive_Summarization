the first of five tournaments for @entity2 this side of the @entity4 takes place in @entity6 this week , where the appearance of the 14 - time @entity9 champion provides a meaty sub-plot to the goings - on down the road at the @entity13			1
this will be @entity2 ’s first showing in a regular @entity17 event since last july , and first tournament anywhere since he finished joint last in the 18 - man invitational tournament he hosted in @entity22 in december			1
so forget the missing tooth that sparked headlines last week			2
here are five questions @entity26 must answer during these five events if he is n’t to go missing at @entity29			1
fourteen - time major winner @entity2 feels ready to start his season by playing two events in a row for @entity26 to win another @entity9 he must address if he is fit enough to challenge the likes of @entity34 thanks to everyone who emailed their thoughts on our campaign to keep live coverage of @entity41 on free - to - air television			1
no one thought selling live coverage to @entity45 would be a smart move for the game			2
@entity48 tells me he ’s been getting the same message , following our exclusive interview with the @entity54 ’s voice of golf			0
one reader , @entity56 , summed up the mood			0
his daughter was good enough to win the @entity59 last year but they can not afford @entity45 and so the only chance she gets to watch live golf is @entity41 and limited coverage of the masters			2
would she have taken up the game at all if she had n’t had even these morsels for inspiration ? our amateur bodies do amazing work in unearthing major talents but you do fear they will soon be operating with both hands tied behind their backs , rather than one			0
is he healthy ? @entity2 is 39 and has n’t a prayer of giving @entity34 a run for his money unless he can offer a positive update on this one			1
an unquenchable work ethic was one of the things that gave him his edge and he needs to be able to put in the hard hours once more			0
thankfully , there are reasons for cautious optimism			0
it ’s got to be good news that he feels ready to start his season by playing two events in a row			0
let ’s hope he goes five events without once clutching his lower back or starting to limp			0
can he find the fairway ? while @entity2 has been away , @entity34 has taken the art of driving to a new level			1
he ’s consistently hitting the ball 350 yards down the middle			0
over the past couple of years , @entity2 was hitting it 300 and crooked			1
although his scorecards did n’t show it , @entity2 , armed with a more fluid swing , actually drove the ball quite well in that invitation event			1
now we wait to see if he can locate enough fairways in @entity17 events to compete			1
despite showing a more fluid swing the 39 - year - old must also compete with @entity34 's consistent driving ‘ i did not have a problem ( with cocaine )			2
but that ’s not the issue			0
’ @entity121 @entity120 will presumably be suing all those publications who claimed his six - month break was due to a problem with recreational drugs			2
curiously , none of the said outlets have placed their lawyers on high alert			0
has he got the chipping yips ? it was positively shocking to see @entity2 , in his last outing , give a passable impersonation of a 24 - handicapper at chipping			1
on six occasions he clunked the ball no more than a few feet in front of him			0
logic suggests this will not happen once he gets back into the tournament routine , but it ’s not a certainty			0
previously , i ’d have said @entity2 could give up the game for a decade and still not duff six chips on his return			1
the @entity2 of old was a fearless and composed putter during the vital moments - but is that @entity2 gone ? has there ever been a start to a year like this one ? normally january and february are mildly diverting			1
now over the next month we ’ll see two @entity156 captains chosen on either side of the @entity158 , world no 1 @entity34 cross-examined in a @entity160 courtroom and , perhaps , the @entity161 ending 60 years of tradition and taking live coverage of @entity41 away from the @entity54			0
that ’s before the actual golf			0
can he still putt under pressure ? nobody will convince me there was ever anyone to compare to @entity2 when it came to holing vital putts			2
but it ’s a sad truism that putting is always the first thing to go , and it ’s a long time since we ’ve seen him display the sort of fearlessness on the greens that used to be a given			2
can he create some momentum ? on each of the four occasions @entity2 won the masters he did it the same way — building up a head of steam and winning at least one event between january and march			1
three of his five tournaments are at places where he has been a serial champion			2
he ’s won two of them eight times and the other a mere seven			0
so while it ’s not imperative he claims an 80th @entity17 victory during these five events to have a chance at the masters , he surely has to contend in at least a couple of them .			1

@entity2 is set to play his first regular @entity17 event since last july
