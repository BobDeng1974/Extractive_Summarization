the @entity0 has been accused of damaging the @entity2 ’s tourism industry over its prediction last week that @entity2 faces the likelihood of a decade of soggy summers – because just three years ago it told us to prepare for repeats of the drought of 1976			1
in may 2010 its climate extremes scientist @entity10 warned we would roast in the summer months and be faced with tap water bans			2
yet last week yet another glimpse into the future by @entity0 experts and colleagues from leading @entity2 universities suggested rainy summers are on the cards for the foreseeable future			1
a sunbather basks on @entity21 last week but the @entity0 warns of a decade of soggy summers a man is battered by heavy wind and rain on @entity26 seafront			1
three years ago @entity0 said hose pipe bans would be needed because of continually hot and dry summers back in 2010 , ms @entity10 said the nation should brace itself for a repeat of the extraordinary 16 - month drought period up to august 1976 when some parts of @entity33 suffered 45 days in a row without rain , and temperatures stayed at @entity37 ( 32c )			1
emphasising the need to expect the worst , ms @entity10 said preparations should include ‘ designing buildings to cope with the heat , putting in place emergency plans in hospitals and schools , growing heat - resistant crops and ( imposing ) hose pipe bans ’			2
even more recently – in january 2012 – the government ’s first @entity49 , compiled with the help of @entity0 scientists , predicted a decrease in summer rainfall over coming decades and sizzling sunshine that would persuade holidaymakers to stay at home rather than head for the @entity59			0
but last week meteorologists at a @entity0 conference into climate change in @entity63 said a warmer @entity64 meant @entity2 faced a higher chance of wet summers for up to ten years			1
now tourism bosses have accused the experts of driving @entity2 holidaymakers abroad by presenting ‘ academic machinations ’ as reliable weather predictions			1
a woman enjoys the sun in @entity74 , @entity75 , last wednesday - when weathermen predicted showers the @entity2 has seen severe summer flooding in recent years			1
pictured : flooded businesses in the centre of @entity81 , @entity82 in june last year one even suggested delegates to last week ’s conference should be made to bet their pensions on a decade of soggy summers if they were so sure of their claims			1
the anger has emerged most strongly in the @entity90 – the most popular holiday - at - home destination for @entity2 – where tourism leaders say a bad summer forecast wipes out £ 300million worth of income in @entity95 and @entity96 alone			2
visit @entity96 head @entity97 , said : ‘ i wish that these so - called experts would keep their mouths shut			0
‘ in recent years the @entity0 got the “ barbecue summer ” wrong , the hosepipe ban wrong – their credibility is shot			2
so why not just shut up			0
‘ if you run a campsite or have a seaside business it ’s a massive problem			0
people thinking of a holiday are driven abroad or simply do n’t bother			0
‘ a bad summer forecast brings a five to ten per cent drop in business			0
that ’s a loss of £ 300million to @entity95 and @entity96 and a lot of jobs and businesses on the line			0
tourism experts say businesses could lose money after the latest warning about soggy summers			1
@entity121 , a flooded road in @entity123 , @entity124 ‘ are the forecasters prepared to put their salaries and pensions on that ? somehow i doubt it			0
’ he added : ‘ there is absolutely no certainty in long - range predictions			2
they are just academic machinations but when they emerge they fuel @entity2 paranoia about the weather			1
’ the @entity139 , @entity2 ’s third most popular domestic holiday destination thanks to the @entity141 , is less weather - dependent			2
but @entity143 , of @entity144 , said long and medium term forecasts had ‘ real potential to damage @entity2 tourism ’			1
‘ meteorological organisations need to work with the tourism industry to better understand how weather influences the tourism decision - making process			0
’ last night a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ new research suggests long - term @entity64 currents may be playing an important role in wet summers			0
‘ these are understood to operate on cycles of a decade or more , and it appears we are well into the “ wet ” phase of this cycle			0
that does not mean every summer will be a washout			0
‘ we have worked with the tourism industry to provide detailed forecasts for 5,000 resorts , beaches and attractions so visitors can plan their day out with confidence and make the most of the great @entity2 weather come @entity173			1
’ the assertion in this article that @entity0 scientists had predicted a likelihood of a decade of soggy summers was based on reports of a @entity0 science workshop in @entity63 on june 18			1
the @entity0 says those reports misrepresented scientists who were discussing early research and not making predictions			0
a more detailed explanation is provided in the @entity0 news blog here .			0
