by @entity0 published : 09:36 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 18:10 est , 25 february 2013 mother - of - three @entity2 is celebrating an amazing weight loss achievement after shedding fifteen stone in six years			1
the primary school chef from @entity6 , who was affectionately known as ' @entity8 ' by colleagues and friends , lost the weight after having a gastric band fitted and now weighs just 12 stone			1
@entity2 started to put on weight after having children , now aged 28 , 27 and 13 and says that she tried every diet she had heard of in an effort to be thinner but finally underwent gastric band surgery after doctors told her she would die if she continued to grow			1
@entity2 has lost 15 stone in weight since having a gastric band fitted and now fits in to size 12 clothes just after her 40th birthday , medics told @entity2 that she needed to lose 10 stone - or risk dying before she was 50			1
she tried a series of crash diets and even weight loss pills , but despite successfully losing small amounts @entity2 always piled the pounds back on			2
@entity2 had a gastric band fitted five years ago in a last - ditch attempt to slim down to a healthy weight			1
after the surgery , @entity2 's size dropped dramatically , and she now weighs 12 stone and fits in to a dress size 12/14			1
@entity2 , who works at @entity37 , @entity6 , said : ' after i had the three kids i just started putting the weight on			0
' i 'm not a lazy person , any one that knows me knows i 'm not idle but i suppose my diet did n't help			0
' i 'm guilty of snacking on things at home , but whatever i tried to do to lose weight it did n't work			2
' and i really did try , i do n't want people to think that i did n't try different ways to lose weight , but i 'm not going to say that i 've never eaten chocolate or fatty foods , because i have			2
@entity2 worked as a cook at @entity37 but says she never ate at work , despite being surrounded by food ' i feel better now , the doctors said to me " if you do n't lose 10 stone you 'll be dead soon "			1
' i thought that i wanted to get more out of life so i decided to lose the weight any way i could			0
' the idea of not being there for my three kids was unbearable , i did it for them as much as myself			0
' it might sound strange but i never ate at work			0
even though i was surrounded by food i never got hungry			0
' it used to gorge on chocolate and crisps when i got home from work and the weight just piled on and on			0
' though her surgery was paid for by the @entity75 , @entity2 had to spend £ 7,350 of her own cash to have excess saggy skin removed from her arms and stomach			1
she is now saving up to have a procedure on her legs so that they match her new body shape			0
according to the @entity84 , a gastric banding - where a band is used to reduce the size of the stomach - can cost anywhere between £ 5,000 and £ 8,000			2
a gastric bypass - where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach - costs between £ 9,500 and £ 15,000 .			0

@entity2 weighed 27 stone at her heaviest
doctors told the chef she could die if she did n't lose weight
she now weighs 12 stone and is a dress size 12/14
@entity75 *funded* the gastric band op but she has paid £ *7k* to remove excess skin
