as a wealth management consultant for a prestigious @entity3 firm , @entity0 is used to keeping his cool			2
but lately , that 's become rather more difficult			0
@entity0 , 54 , is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer , which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side - effect of hot flushes			1
' i have about ten to 12 flushes a day , and six to eight at night , ' says @entity0 , a @entity16 who lives in @entity18 , @entity19 , with wife @entity20 , a teacher , 52 , and their three children , @entity24 , 22 , @entity25 , 20 , and @entity26 , 18			1
@entity0 , 54 , was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012			1
he is now well and his tumours have shrunk ' i know when one 's coming			0
the feeling suddenly builds up as if you 've gone into a sauna			0
within minutes i 'm in full sweat			0
five or ten minutes later , it 's gone			2
' @entity0 has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients			2
' i 'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked , ' he says			0
' i nip off to the loos and have a wash and change			0
' hormone therapy , usually given in the form of regular injections or implants , is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate			1
it ca n't cure the cancer , but can help keep it under control			0
hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat			1
the jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone ( @entity67 ) blockers			2
these act on the pituitary gland in the brain , to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone			2
even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment the majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow			2
lowering the amount in the body means it 's less able to spread			0
in @entity87 alone , 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity @entity93 @entity92			0
however , blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side - effects , explains @entity97 , a specialist nurse at the charity			1
' testosterone is a man 's natural source of energy , so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue			1
it also has an important role in sexual function , so there can be a loss of libido , ' she says			0
' there can be mood swings and depression ; some men also report breast swelling , nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle			0
all of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause , when levels of their equivalent hormone , oestrogen , start to fall			2
' hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes , and can cause bone thinning , because testosterone is important for bone density			1
studies by @entity93 @entity92 have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes , and 27 per cent of these say it is the side - effect that troubles them the most			1
this rings true for @entity0			2
' people do n't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning , ' he says			1
' i am basically a menopausal man			0
i have mood swings and i 've put on two - and - a - half stone			0
but the worst thing has been the hot sweats			0
i 'm up a few times a night , sometimes having to change the sheets and it 's tiring			0
' of course , this wakes @entity20 up , too , and then she 's worrying			0
' she used to have hot flushes and so she 's very sympathetic			1
the difference with me is that i do n't know if they will ever end			0
' men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life , says @entity97			1
' but men who are on it along with radiotherapy tend to only have it for up to three years until the cancer has been treated			0
' she says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side - effects of hormone therapy			1
' men are warned about side - effects , but clinic appointment times are not long , so doctors ca n't realistically talk through them all in detail			1
it 's also hard to predict what side - effects a man will have and how he will respond			1
' there are treatments to alleviate hot flushes , such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone , which has an effect like testosterone but does n't fuel the growth of cancer cells			1
some men find that complementary therapies , such as acupuncture , or herbal supplements , such as sage tea or black cohosh , help , but the benefits are yet to be proven clinically			0
but now new research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy , or @entity202 , a psychological technique and talking therapy , could help			0
this causes hot flushes and night sweats a trial on prostate cancer patients at @entity210 , published in march , has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally			1
@entity202 works by helping people understand the links between their beliefs , thoughts and behaviour			0
it 's a recognised treatment for anxiety and other mental health conditions			0
@entity221 , professor of clinical health psychology at @entity222 , has previously found that @entity202 reduces hot flushes in menopausal women , and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen			1
' beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms , ' she says			1
professor @entity234 believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful , positive ones , they will have less of an impact			1
her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer , all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week			1
half the group were given treatment as usual ( access to doctors and information about the problem ) and the other half received a self - help @entity202 booklet , a cd and two sessions with a psychologist			0
the men were taught breathing exercises , advised on lifestyle changes and sleep management , and encouraged to challenge negative beliefs and presumptions			0
' women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status , ' says professor @entity234			1
' in our interviews with men , we found the hot flushes signified a threat to their masculinity			2
' they felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them			1
and they catastrophised , so if they had one in the night they assumed they 'd feel terrible the next day			0
' after six weeks , the @entity284 's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent , compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group			1
@entity202 is not always easily available on the @entity287			0
professor @entity234 is hoping to offer her self - help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through @entity93 @entity92 , but this has not yet been confirmed			1
@entity0 was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago , at the age of 50 , so quality of life is important to him			1
by the time of his diagnosis , the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to his lungs and to the lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen , so surgery was not an option			2
while the hormone treatment has been helpful , the hot flushes have been hard to deal with			1
he is about to try a new type of radiotherapy , but expects to be on hormone therapy indefinitely			2
however , he says taking the right attitude to hot flushes has helped him hugely			2
' from the beginning i 've been open about my condition , so all my friends and clients know why i have hot flushes			2
' it 's nothing to be embarrassed about			0
my family and i have learned to live in the now and be grateful for what we 've got			0

@entity0 , 54 , from @entity18 , is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer
this starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body
one side - effect is hot flushes : ' i have about ten to 12 flushes a day '
