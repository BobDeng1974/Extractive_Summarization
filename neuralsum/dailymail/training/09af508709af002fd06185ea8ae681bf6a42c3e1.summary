by @entity0 3:27 pm on 15th august 2011 a @entity1 might not be every housewife 's first choice of pet - but @entity6 's beloved @entity5 is firmly part of the family			1
the two - year - old wild pig has the run of her home , tucks into dinners of dog food and sleeps every night under a blanket on her sofa			2
the lucky animal is treated to his cosy existence after @entity6 adopted and hand - raised him when he was orphaned as a baby			2
hogs and kisses : @entity6 with her house - trained @entity5 at their home in @entity26 @entity6 , 50 , who lives in @entity26 , said : ' some people think i 'm crazy having a pet warthog , but @entity5 is really loveable and an absolute darling to have around the house			1
' we got him as a baby when one of the neighbours brought him in after his mother was killed			2
' he was so tiny and vulnerable , and i nursed him by hand until he was old enough to be by himself			2
' he lived in our front room , and when he was big enough i used to take him on long walks outside so he could get used to his natural surroundings			2
pucker up : @entity6 gives her pet a goodnight kiss who 's a boar ? @entity47 's hog takes up most of the sofa ' i always imagined he would go back and live in the wild again , but he obviously liked it too much with us			1
' @entity5 is now firmly settled at the rural home @entity6 shares with her husband @entity55 , also 50			1
the warthog weighed just a few pounds when they adopted him in november 2008 but has since grown to around 12 stone			2
a helping ham : org is bottle fed as an orphaned youngster he now munches his way through at least two kilograms of @entity66 each evening , served up for him in the kitchen from a dog bowl			0
and on top of that he devours a pile of daily treats including dried sweetcorn kernels , ginger biscuits , marshmallows and his favourite @entity79 chocolates			1
life imitating art : a warthog named @entity82 featured in @entity84 's @entity83 by day tourist managers @entity6 and @entity55 let @entity5 roam freely outside in the private @entity87 game reserve which they run in @entity26 's northern @entity88			1
but the loyal animal returns to their home each evening at dusk for his dinner and to relax in front of the television			0
@entity6 , a mother of three , said : ' he has the best of both worlds because he goes out and spends the day with the other warthogs but almost always comes home when it gets dark			0
' we feed him and cuddle him , sometimes we clean him , and then he goes to sleep on the sofa			0
' he 's getting really big these days and his tusks are sharp so we have had to recover the sofas with a tough canvas lining or they would get ripped apart			1
' we also have to keep an eye on him because if we leave him unattended he can open the door to the kitchen and empty all the cupboards looking for food			0
' sometime we think he thinks he 's a dog because he gets really affectionate and likes to be loved			1
' i often share a sofa with him when we watch tv			0
we 'll snuggle under a blanket as he likes to be close to me			0
favourite spot : @entity6 's @entity120 does n't stand a chance as the warthog settles down for the night ' sometimes he 'll take the whole sofa for himself and @entity55 and i will sit on the floor			1
' warthogs are related to pigs and common across many parts of @entity26			0
the tough animals usually live in burrows and survive by eating grasses or digging for roots			0
they were made famous by @entity82 , the friendly warthog in @entity84 's 1994 cartoon movie @entity83			1
but in the wild the animals are far from cuddly and are often known to attack a potential predator when cornered			0
males can use their protruding tusks to fight with others for dominance , and warthogs are reportedly able to inflict deadly wounds even to lions			0
@entity5 has also become a firm friend with the couple 's other pets , which include a pair of parrots and a lively @entity120 named @entity150			1
@entity6 , who also runs a jewellery design business , said : " you might not imagine that a warthog and a @entity120 would get on but they are the best of friends			0
' @entity150 often perches himself on @entity5 's back when he 's sleeping , and although they sometimes fight over the food it 's always good natured			1
' she added : ' we have never forced him to stay here but he keeps coming back			0
' it is great that he has time outside and now that he has reached maturity , he has found himself a girlfriend and this year will probably become a father			0
' but we 're delighted that he likes to come home every day , and people are always amazed when they see him sitting on the sofa			2
' we have three daughters , and they all get on brilliantly with @entity5 too			1
he really feels like part of the family now			0
' i know some people might look at my @entity5 and think he 's ugly , but he 's actually really loving and affectionate			1
' they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and i think he 's gorgeous			2

watches telly , eats marshmallows and *pedigree* chums
' some people say my @entity5 is ugly , but he 's a darling to have around the house '
