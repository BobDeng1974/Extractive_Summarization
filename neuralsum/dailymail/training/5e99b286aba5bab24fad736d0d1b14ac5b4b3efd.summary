eating walnuts may improve performance on cognitive function tests , including those for memory , concentration and information processing speed			1
the study led by dr. @entity17 at the @entity18 , @entity19 , found that cognitive function was consistently greater in adult participants that consumed walnuts - regardless of age , gender or ethnicity			1
this cross-sectional study is the first large representative analysis of walnut intake and cognitive function			2
it is also the only study to include all available cognitive data across multiple @entity34 ( @entity34 )			0
the @entity34 draws from a large sampling of the @entity37 population , typically ages one to 90 years old			0
in this study , participants included adults ages 20 - 59 as well as 60 and over			2
dr. @entity17 and co-researcher dr. @entity42 found that study participants with higher walnut consumption performed significantly better on a series of six cognitive tests			0
dr. @entity17 said : ' it is exciting to see the strength of the evidence from this analysis across the @entity37 population supporting the previous results of animal studies that have shown the neuroprotective benefit from eating walnuts ; and it 's a realistic amount - less than a handful per day ( 13 grams )			2
' as the baby boomer population grows older , conditions affecting memory such as @entity59 's and dementia will become a greater concern ( file photo ) the study adds to a growing body of research surrounding walnuts ' positive effect on reducing cognitive impairment and overall brain health , which includes the possible beneficial effects of slowing or preventing the progression of alzheimer 's disease in mouse models			1
as the baby boomer population grows older , conditions affecting memory such as @entity59 's and dementia will become a greater concern			0
according to a 2012 @entity82 article , the estimated number of new cases of dementia each year worldwide is nearly 7.7 million , and the number of people living with dementia worldwide is estimated at 35.6 million			0
this number is predicted to double by 2030 and more than triple by 2050			0
there are numerous possible active ingredients in walnuts that may be contributing factors in protecting cognitive functions			0
this includes the high antioxidant content of walnuts ( 3.7 mmol / ounce ) ; the combination of numerous vitamins and minerals ; as well as the fact that they are the only nut that contain a significant source of alpha - linolenic acid ( @entity105 ) ( 2.5 grams per ounce ) , a plant - based omega - 3 fatty acid with heart and brain - health benefits			1
' it is n't every day that research results in such simple advice - eating a handful of walnuts daily as a snack , or as part of a meal , can help improve your cognitive health , ' said dr. @entity17 .			1

walnuts improve concentration and information processing , according to *scientists*
only nut that contains significant source of alpha - linolenic acid ( @entity105 ) - plant - based omega - 3 fatty acid with heart and brain - health benefits
