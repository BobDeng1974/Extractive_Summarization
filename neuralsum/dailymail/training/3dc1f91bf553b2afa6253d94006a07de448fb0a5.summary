a judge today began the process of selecting the jury that will hear the trial of accused @entity5 bomber @entity4 , telling the first of some 1,200 prospects to read no more news accounts about the deadly blasts			1
his accusers brandish a confession scribbled inside a boat during an intensive manhunt and a video they say shows him placing a backpack with a bomb a few feet from a little boy who died when it exploded seconds later			0
his defenders bank on the story of a difficult childhood in a former @entity24 republic and his radicalization at the hands of an influential older brother who could have pressured him into participating in the deadly attack			2
@entity51 district judge @entity50 acknowledged the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be aware of the incident , but reminded the group that their job during the three to four month trial would be to consider only the evidence presented in court			2
' mr. @entity4 is charged in connection with events that occurred near the finish line of the @entity5 on april 15 , 2013 that resulted in the deaths of three people , ' as well as with the fatal shooting of a police officer three days later , @entity50 told the group of 200 prospects			2
@entity50 signaled that he would allow about three weeks for selection of the jury that will determine both @entity4 's guilt and whether , if convicted , he will be sentenced to death			1
he said opening statements would begin around january 26			0
it is arguably the most high - profile federal death penalty case since @entity78 was convicted and executed for the 1995 @entity80 bombing			1
@entity4 's lawyers tried in vain for months to get the trial moved , arguing the @entity85 jury pool was tainted because of the number of locals with connections to the race and drawing parallels to the @entity78 case , which was moved to @entity92 for similar reasons			1
but judge @entity50 has been unmoved			0
defense : this panel of file photos shows attorneys @entity98 , left , @entity99 , center , and @entity101 , right , who are the defense team for @entity4 a potential juror enters the @entity105 monday as jury selection begins a woman holds a sign beside a security office outside the federal courthouse in @entity85 fury : a demonstrator holds a sign reading ' demand @entity114 / @entity113 ' and a @entity115 , outside the @entity116 in @entity85 a federal police officer and k - 9 dog patrol outside the federal courthouse in @entity85 , monday , jan. 5 , 2015 , for the first day of jury selection jury selection alone is expected to take several weeks because of extensive media coverage and the thousands of runners , spectators and others in the area personally affected by the bombings			1
the process also could be slowed if potential jurors express objections to the death penalty			1
in the end , a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be seated to hear a trial expected to last three to five months			2
at around 9am monday , @entity4 arrived at the federal courthouse in @entity85 accompanied by her attorneys			1
dressed in a dark shirt and light slacks , the 21 - year - old bombing suspect was described as periodically rubbing his facial hair and shirt collar as he listened to the judge speak to the prospective jurors			2
a moderate police presence was visible outside the courthouse , located in a downtown neighborhood that is the site of extensive construction			0
cruisers patrolled area roadways and officers with dogs walked the perimeter of the courthouse building			0
high - profile case : those chosen from a pool of about 1,200 will decide whether @entity4 , since here in a courtroom sketch from december 18 , 2014 , planned and carried out the deadly @entity5 attacks media circus : new cameras take positions outside the federal courthouse in @entity85 monday for the first day of jury selection some legal observers say @entity4 's lawyers — facing powerful evidence against him — will probably focus their energies on the penalty phase , when they could present mitigating evidence to spare his life			1
he has a strong team behind him			2
attorney @entity176 touts a strong record of helping her high - profile clients avoid the death penalty , including @entity180 , the @entity180 ; @entity182 bomber @entity181 ; and @entity183 , who killed six people and wounded former @entity51 rep. @entity185			1
@entity4 's lawyers are likely to narrow in on motive and any pressure exerted on him , said @entity188 , a former assistant @entity51 attorney in @entity189 who has investigated @entity51 ties to terrorism			1
‘ i think his mitigation will be in part paying close attention to what his explanation is and what circumstances beyond his control ... caused him to do this , ’ @entity188 said			0
prosecutors say 21 - year - old @entity4 and his brother , @entity202 — ethnic @entity203 who had lived in the @entity51 for about a decade — carried out the bombings as retaliation for @entity51 actions in @entity208 countries			1
they are also accused of killing @entity210 police officer @entity209			0
@entity202 , 26 , died after a firefight with police several days after the bombings			0
jury selection alone is expected to take several weeks because of extensive media coverage and the thousands of runners , spectators and others in the area personally affected by the bombings ( pictured ) clamoring for justice : several victims of the attacks plan to attend the hotly anticipated trial brothers : prosecutors say 21 - year - old @entity4 ( left ) and his brother , @entity202 ( right ) carried out the bombings as retaliation for @entity51 actions in @entity208 countries @entity4 was captured later that day , wounded and bloodied , hiding inside a boat stored in a suburban yard			1
prosecutors said he described a motive in a note written in the boat : ‘ the @entity51 government is killing our innocent civilians ’ and ‘ we @entity208 are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all			0
’ @entity4 's lawyers may lay the groundwork for some kind of mental health explanation , said @entity245 , a professor at @entity246			1
that could include any persecution his family might have suffered as ethnic minorities in @entity251 , where the brothers spent most of their lives before moving to the @entity51 with their parents and two sisters			0
‘ i think the real value in that may be to start to try to generate even a little bit of empathy around this and humanize the kid a little bit , hopefully enough to save a life , ’ @entity245 said			0
@entity264 , a @entity265 psychologist and terrorism expert who wrote a book , ‘ why “ @entity270 : deconstructing the accused @entity268 and @entity269 , ’ said she believes @entity4 may have been susceptible to the influence of his brother and others because he had lost structure in the year before the bombings			1
among those life changes : @entity4 had left the family 's @entity265 home to attend the @entity280 in @entity281 , his parents moved to the volatile @entity283 region of @entity284 , and the family was having financial problems			1
strategy : the defense team will likely focus their energies on the penalty phase , when they could present mitigating evidence to spare @entity4 's life long time coming : security stands outside the federal courthouse in @entity85 , monday for the first day of jury selection in the trial of @entity5 bombing suspect @entity4 ) authorities believe @entity202 became radicalized in the last few years of his life , including during a six - month trip to @entity283 and @entity300 in 2012			1
prosecutors , however , say @entity4 showed signs before the bombings — even to his closest friends — that he was becoming radicalized			2
at least one of three college friends convicted of lying or impeding the investigation is expected to testify against him			0
an additional friend who pleaded guilty to possessing a gun used to kill a police officer during the manhunt is also expected to testify for the prosecution			0
other prosecution witnesses are expected to include people hurt in the bombings , as well as police officers who helped in the aftermath			0
remember : a memorial stands at the site of the first bomb that went off in the @entity268 of 2013 on january 4 @entity4 's defense team has been pushing to show that he may have been intimidated by his brother			1
prosecutors revealed in a court filing that @entity325 , a friend of @entity202 's , said @entity202 participated in a grisly triple slaying in @entity327 , a @entity85 suburb , in 2011			2
the trial , expected to last several months , is likely to draw spectators injured in the bombings , as well as supporters of @entity4 who have demonstrated outside the courthouse during pretrial hearings			2
@entity4 's own lawyers have asked that the demonstrators be kept at arm 's length			1
@entity338 , a @entity339 woman who lost part of her left leg in the bombings , is one of several victims who plan to attend at least part of the trial			0
she said she hopes to gain some understanding of the motive			0
‘ i do n't see it as something that will get me past the horror of that day , ’ she said			0
‘ it 's something that i will always live with			0
