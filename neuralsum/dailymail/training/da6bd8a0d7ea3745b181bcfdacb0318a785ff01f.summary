the council announced she had left her role with immediate effect , five days after she had been put on long - term sick leave			1

’ professor @entity87 ’s report into the abuse crisis in @entity3 was highly critical of her leadership			0
@entity90 ( above ) today said mrs @entity0 ' is to leave ... by mutual agreement , with immediate effect '			1
