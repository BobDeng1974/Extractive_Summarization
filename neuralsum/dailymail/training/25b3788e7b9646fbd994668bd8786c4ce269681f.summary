@entity1 's triumphant autumn / winter 2015 show in @entity2 on sunday made it clear the mother - of - four has firmly made the transition from pop singer to fashion superstar			1
the 40 - year - old unveiled her latest collection of over-sized jumpers and midi skirts to rave reviews but , ever modest , she is the first to admit she does n't actually sketch her own designs			1
saying she 's had ' no formal training ' in a new interview , the mother - of - four instead directs a team to create her rapturously - received clothes			1
she added : ' i 've learnt a lot , in the last seven years			0
i 've learnt a lot very , very quickly			0
and i continue to learn			0
' in a recent interview with the @entity35 she described her design process : ' when i ’m starting work on the collection , i just sit with my team and talk to them about what i like , what i find inspiring , what i ’m desiring , what i want to wear , what i have n’t done before			2
' we have fit models we work with , and we ’ll either work the fit model or we ’ll drape on a stand			2
i can draw , but badly			0
i think that ’s okay			0
no one ’s expecting me to do it the normal way			0
' and that ’s a good thing			0
but i do sometimes take all my clothes off and drape on myself			0
it ’s just a bit more pleasant for everybody if we do it on models			0
' but while we were once accustomed to seeing @entity1 strutting down to @entity62 in a tiny @entity64 dress and @entity65 , these days , mrs @entity67 body - covering , not body - con outfits			1
@entity1 's chunky knits and midi skirt ensembles that barely revealed an inch of flesh have been hailed as ' the new kind of sexy ' @entity1 's family ( @entity75 ) @entity74 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 sat by @entity80 on the front row			1
' this was a sexy and sophisticated take that put shape at its centre for soft and womanly silhouettes , ' wrote @entity88 's @entity87			1
@entity1 turtleneck sweater get a similar style at @entity91 visit site as her family supported her from the @entity94 , @entity1 debuted her latest collection at @entity96			1
the stylish mother of four chose to wear an all - black look from her eponymous line consisting of a boxy mock neck sweater , button - front skirt , and pointed heels			2
ever so chic ( she goes by @entity1 after all ) , the fall line was a reflection of the designer 's personal style			1
sumptuous knits , cut out dresses , and cocoon coats filled the runway and what 's not to love about that ? @entity1 's custom ensemble is not available to the general public , but you can buy a similar sweater now at @entity91 ( click right )			1
the successful brand continues to expand as the @entity118 just opened a new boutique on @entity121 's swanky @entity120 and big names continue to dress in her wares including @entity124 and @entity125			2

she told @entity27 : ' i 'm busier now - so i could n't totter around in a tight dress and a pair of heels			2
i think i feel a little more relaxed			0
' mrs @entity1 , admits that she was too afraid to dress down in the past			1
she explained : ' i suppose if i 'm being honest , i would have been scared , right at the beginning , to wear lots of layers and to wear a flat shoe			0
' she now favours a muted colour palette of mostly blacks , greys and sometimes white , as well as flats , and she almost exclusively wears her own designs			0
mrs @entity1 has made the transition to globally respected fashion designer , silencing her critics by launching a hugely successful brand loved by a-listers and fashion editors alike			1
she unveiled her @entity20 collection at @entity96 on sunday to a stellar front row , including husband @entity78 and their sons @entity76 , 15 , @entity74 , 12 , @entity77 , nine , and daughter @entity79 , three , sitting alongside @entity88 editor - in - chief @entity80 , and stylist @entity173			1
shunning the trend for overexposure , currently championed by the likes of @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity1 's range was a much more modest affair			1
her designs were full of cream midi skirts , voluminous knits and calf - scraping culottes - proving that more really is more			2
the entire collection went down a storm with @entity88 's most esteemed fashion editors			1
last year , the fashion bible hinted that @entity1 's collection was reminiscent of the stuff they had seen on the @entity194 runway before and commented that they 'd like to see a ' bit more of her ' in her designs			1
it seems she took note			0
with a new direction , 40 - year - old @entity1 's stand - out designs , which are clearly based on her own wardrobe , winning her plaudits			1
shunning the trend for overexposure loved on all the red carpets , @entity1 's sophisticated and feminine collection still won plaudits @entity1 seen on the front tow of a fashion week show in 2008 making notes ... how things have changed @entity211 , @entity212 , added : ' bringing back sexy - a slither of flesh at the waist or a jigsaw of fabrics forming five shades of black - was only a sidebar to the main story : @entity1 has made it as a designer			1
' i ca n’t think of another celebrity who has been willing and able to create a unique style			0
' the doyenne of style journalism also added : ' whatever fashion people say about “ @entity229 ” doing all the work , i believe that the foundation and flow of this collection could have come only from her			2
' in her show notes , mrs @entity1 explained ' it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel			1
' the creative process for this collection was an altogether different style			2
mrs @entity1 explains how she decided to start with her classic designs and re-imagine them for a new season			1
' i began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it , ' she wrote			0
' it was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process			2
' familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked			0
volumes have been subverted , menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists , spirals , seams and asymmetry interplayed			0
fabrics bounce and move , a swing is sculptural , and a more body conscious silhouette emerges ... ' for me it is a collection full of possibilities			2
' @entity1 seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this collection , with patent boots and luxurious coats mrs @entity1 explained that she had been thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel commenting on her range , @entity280 's @entity279 wrote : ' equally successful were the mannish double - breasted navy cocoon coats with neat horn buttons ; the herringbone coat with a bustle at the hip ; the chunky cream and navy sweaters with ballooning sleeves ; and the skirt made out of cream velvet bows - @entity229 's answer to the " modern day red carpet " conundrum when worn with a simple chenille sweater			1
' sure , it 's not a problem that vexes most of us , but she 's got all her bases covered			2
' fashion website @entity300 described the collection as ' a study in calm sexiness ' and insisted plenty of women will be climbing over each other to wear it come autumn			0
this is the latest in a string of stylish hits for the star , who last year opened the doors to her flagship store on @entity120			0
then , she beat fashion powerhouse @entity315 , a label loved by the @entity318 , as well as her friend @entity319 for the prestigious title of @entity321 at the @entity322 2014			0
@entity1 , pictured in @entity324 in 2007 , once favoured figure - hugging dresses and pointy stilettos but she 's relaxed her approach to dressing and has adopted a much more pared - back and fashionable approach to getting dressed in the morning			1

@entity1 , 40 , has ' a different way ' of expressing herself
directs designers , gives *feedback* and drapes fabric on herself
@entity88 editors *praised* @entity1 's ' stand - out ' @entity20 collection
