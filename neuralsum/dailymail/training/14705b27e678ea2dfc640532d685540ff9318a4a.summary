by @entity1 reporter published : 16:31 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 16:43 est , 10 march 2013 gender divide : tv presenter prof @entity3 argues pink @entity4 reinforces sexists attitudes which see boys perform better at science @entity4 for girls helps reinforce gender attitudes that see boys performing better in science , a @entity14 television presenter and scientist has claimed			1
professor @entity3 , the popular presenter on the ' @entity17 ' series and ' @entity18 ' , hit out at the sexism that deters women from pursuing the subject			2
since girls are better represented in maths and science in most other countries around the world , the reason why they lag behind in @entity24 must be ' something cultural ' rather than ' an innate biological thing ' , she told an education conference			1
she said : ' the gender divide seems to be getting worse to me			2
' @entity4 has always been a good toy which teaches children about engineering			1
but @entity4 is now producing a range which it is says is for girls , which is completely pink and is about creating cakes			1
' i think the problem is happening at a very young age , when the idea is instilled that there is a big difference between girls and boys , rather than at age 15			2
' she added : ' what i found outrageous was the suggestion that using shopping and pink to get girls interested in science would work			1
it goes back to a 1950s idea of what women should be like			0
' the key is to make these subjects less gender specific than more so			1
' she was speaking in front of teachers and school leaders at the @entity69 event in @entity70			0
criticism : professor @entity3 has attacked @entity4 for making product ranges which are targeted at girls she pointed to a study by the @entity76 which showed @entity24 was one of only three countries where teenage girls did worse than boys in maths and science			1
the married tv scientist , who is a professor at @entity85 and has a young daughter , said : ' it is definitely difficult for women to progress in scientific careers			0
'' one of the problems is childcare			0
if you have a career break , it has an amazingly bad effect on people 's career			0
' if you look at the men and women starting science degrees at university the numbers are about equal , but when you get to professor level , only 15 per cent are women			0
'' popular : the television scientist is best known as a presenter on @entity17 and prehistoric autopsy prof @entity3 , 39 , added : ' the fact that girls are doing better in other parts of the world , suggest it is not an innate biological thing			1
there must be something cultural going on			0
' prof @entity3 is set to appear on screens later this year in the @entity14 documentary @entity117			1
@entity118 said its ' friends ' range was developed following requests from parents and girls for more realistic and detailed sets with brighter colours and role - playing opportunities			0
a spokesman said : ' we 've always had @entity4 bricks that are pink and we 've got a wide variety of different sets			2
' we do n't say “ this is for girls ”			0
it 's up to the child or the parent to make the choice			0
' ' prehistoric ' : @entity24 is behind many countries when it comes to girls being better represented in science			2

the @entity14 presenter attacked @entity4 for producing ranges aimed at girls
she is concerned with the under representation of girls in science
