the challenges of childcare affordability looks to continue for parents as the cost of the service is set to rise up to 30 per cent over the next four years			1
figures presented by the @entity7 predict parents who front up $ 100 a day for childcare would be hit with a rise of $ 40 by 2018 , while parents forking out $ 80 a day would be paying $ 32 more within the same time frame , @entity5 reported			1
it means fees will rise an average of 7 per cent every year over four years , with a total 29.1 per cent rise by 2018			1
these growing costs means a handful of parents will breach the childcare rebate threshold for assistance to claim back 50 per cent of their out - of - pocket costs			1
right now , parents are eligible to claim a maximum of $ 7,500 per child per year under the scheme , according to the @entity40			1
to drive down the costs of the scheme , mr @entity23 said the government would ' announce a comprehensive families ' package in the new year , including child care and parenting leave initiatives '			1
it comes after federal treasurer @entity23 's less than favourable budget update earlier this month which saw $ 2.4 billion more spent on childcare payments than expected he said it would aim to give greater work participation opportunities for parents			1
in a statement to @entity55 , shadow early childhood education minister @entity56 said these projections released by the @entity7 were another ' broken promise '			2
' @entity60 promised to make child care more affordable , but families are facing bigger than ever expected increases in cost , ' she said			0
' this government is only good at one thing and that is breaking every promise they have ever made			0
' a national parenting advocacy group recently called on the government to redirect funds earmarked for @entity60 's paid parental leave scheme into early childhood education and care			0
a survey of 1,200 parents across the country done by @entity78 found this was what 90 per cent of mums and dads wanted			2
mr @entity60 is looking to tweak this policy over the summer holidays in a bid to win @entity87 support next year			0
he has said the paid parent leave scheme , to be funded by a 1.5 per cent tax on big businesses , would involve more money for childcare after a previous version looked at a rebate for parents using carers in the family home			2
but the @entity78 spokeswoman @entity99 said the group 's survey showed parents ' biggest obstacle was finding affordable and quality childcare spots			0
' women are reporting that child care is just too expensive and that it 's not worth working more hours or returning to work even though they want to , ' ms @entity107 said			0
' only about 10 per cent of parents have said that money should go to subsidising nannies			0
' that 's because the vast majority of parents are seeking high quality , affordable childcare			0

@entity55 childcare fees will rise an average of 7 per cent over four years
it came as treasurer @entity23 delivered a grim *mid-year* budget *outlook*
the rising costs means a handful of parents may not be eligible for rebate
right now , parents can claim a maximum of $ 7,500 per child per year
