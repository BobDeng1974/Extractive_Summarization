as an @entity1 strike on @entity2 becomes more and more likely , so does the chance that the @entity1 will be fighting on the same side as @entity5 for the first time ever			1
@entity2 ’s president @entity7 , after all , counts the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the september 11 attacks among his enemies			2
and without intending it , an @entity1 intervention into @entity2 ’s civil war also has the potential to not just aid @entity5 allies , but also to help arm them			1
the @entity39 correspondent for @entity40 penned a column in the @entity43 publication tuesday titled @entity44 know he ’s fighting on @entity5 ’s side ? in which he described a scenario where the @entity1 and its enemies become convenient allies , at least within the confines of @entity2			1
‘ maybe the @entity1 should ask @entity5 for intelligence help , ’ writes @entity36			2
‘ after all , this is the group with “ boots on the ground ” , something the @entity1 have no interest in doing			2
and maybe @entity5 could offer some target information facilities to the country which usually claims that the supporters of @entity5 , rather than the @entity2 , are the most wanted men in the world			2
’ though colorful at times , the picture @entity36 paints is composed of stark , black and white realities			0
just this week , an @entity5 affiliated rebel group ’s commander in @entity2 has pledged to target communities of @entity2 president @entity7 's @entity67 minority with rockets in revenge for the alleged chemical attack near @entity71			1
‘ for every chemical rocket that has fallen on our people in @entity71 , one of their villages will , by the will of @entity76 , pay for it , ’ @entity72 of the @entity72 said in the recording posted on @entity74			0
‘ on top of that we will prepare a thousand rockets that will be fired on their towns in revenge for the @entity89 massacre			0
’ warning : @entity1 secretary of state @entity90 is among the high - ranking officials leaving little doubt that chemical weapons were used against @entity2 's enemies , including @entity5 the @entity2 opposition has accused government forces of an attack on insurgent - held suburbs of the capital last week where poison gas appears to have killed hundreds of people			1
‘ to the bereaved mothers of the children and the people of @entity89 , i say that your blood is a debt that we and every mujahid ( @entity115 holy fighter ) have to pay , ’ @entity103 said in the recording entitled , @entity105			0
@entity118 's @entity117 fighters have claimed responsibility for the deadliest bombings in the two - and - a - half - year - old @entity2 conflict and their brigades have led some of the most successful rebel offensives against @entity7 's forces			0
the group has been formally designated a terrorist organization by the @entity1 , a step which @entity129 said was vindicated by a declaration in april that it was merging with @entity5 's @entity132 group			2
@entity129 now says @entity118 is little more than a front for @entity5			0
that effectively squares the goals of the @entity1 and of the terrorist group			0
ready to strike : the guided - missile destroyer @entity137 is one of four positioned in the @entity139 and prepared to strike several @entity2 locations with @entity142 missiles ' up for grabs and up for sale ' : @entity146 second in command @entity147 said this month that he fears toppling the @entity2 government will help arm their enemies , most notably the @entity72 , an @entity5 backed group ‘ this , of course , will not be trumpeted by the @entity154 or the @entity155 – nor , i suppose , by @entity5 , ’ @entity36 writes			1
‘ but it does raise some interesting possibilities			0
’ one such possibility was posed by the @entity146 ’s second - in - command @entity147 , who believes that toppling @entity7 — which , it should be said , the @entity1 has never said it would try to do with a strike on @entity2 — would be a field day for @entity5			1
@entity147 told the @entity162 that the @entity2 government ’s weapons ‘ are going to be up for grabs and up for sale ’ should @entity7 fall			1
and while the @entity1 is distracted , @entity147 believes @entity5 could take advantage			1
‘ if we do n't keep the pressure on them , they will reconstitute , ’ he said			0
‘ i worry about complacency in the face of that			0

both the @entity1 and @entity5 want the @entity2 government to pay for the alleged use of chemical weapons
@entity146 second in command @entity147 fears toppling the @entity2 government will help arm its enemies , including @entity5
