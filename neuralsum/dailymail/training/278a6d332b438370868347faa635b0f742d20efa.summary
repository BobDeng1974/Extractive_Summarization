few things have had more influence on science - fiction than @entity3 , and fans breathed a sigh of relief when @entity8 's 2009 reboot of @entity10 's classic series stayed respectful to the source material			1
thankfully , from the look of these latest screens , the video game will do so , too			2
although most details are being kept under wraps , gameplay sees @entity18 and @entity19 working together to stop the legendary @entity20 from conquering the galaxy			1
out of this world : the @entity23 has been recreated wonderfully and you will be able to wander around inside interestingly , although combat revolves around a cover - system similar to that found in the @entity29 , there 's a strong focus on teamwork			2
@entity19 and @entity18 will both have their own special abilities that reflect their unique characteristics			1
@entity18 can call for an aerial assault from the @entity23 , while @entity19 can mind melt , perform the @entity38 death grip and use the tricorder to find enemy weak points			1
although there has been some concern from fans that the game would be straight - forward shooter , @entity41 , vice president of @entity42 told @entity48 last year : ' you will have elements of a shooter			2
you 'll have elements of exploration , and adventure and discovery			0
this is what the new @entity3 is about			0
' the game is powered by @entity59 , most notably used in @entity60 and @entity62 gameplay footage revealed last year already looked graphically stronger than both of those titles			1
particularly impressive were the well - rendered environments which conveyed the impressive sense of scale fundamentally required in such a title			0
watch this space : gameplay and level design lends itself to cooperative gameplay			1
often you 'll have to work together to solve environmental puzzles it promises a ' sweeping journey ' across unexplored planets and enemy battleships , and players will have full access to all of the latest 23rd century gear			0
speaking to @entity82 , @entity83 and pr director at @entity85 , said : ' it ’s great to see that the release of @entity88 : the @entity89 has caused so much interest			0
@entity42 have spent the last three years making the game and we ’re truly proud of the results			0
' by giving players the chance to step into the shoes of either @entity18 or @entity19 , two of the most well - known and loved characters in all of science fiction and adventure , we ’re giving both gamers and @entity3 fans alike the chance to really explore the universe of this iconic franchise			1
' it 's set for release on april 26			0
now watch how they made the game : follow us on @entity109 : @ @entity110 and on @entity111 : @entity112 .			0
