for the first time , candidates will be considered if they have convictions , cautions or fines for offences likely to include possession of cannabis or shoplifting			1
the @entity22 has established that @entity1 ’s biggest force is already recruiting those who have been on the wrong side of the law in a controversial attempt to increase race diversity			1
it can also be revealed that all forces across @entity29 and @entity30 will be encouraged to adopt softer rules on who should be ruled out from becoming a police officer			1
the @entity34 , which sets standards for the profession , is to publish a code of practice in the @entity39 on the vetting of would - be police officers			0
it will set out a relaxation of the current rules – which ban anyone with previous convictions , cautions or fines in all but the most exceptional circumstances – on the grounds that it is keeping potentially valuable people from becoming police officers			1
instead , the college will tell police chiefs they can take on applicants with criminal pasts , as long as they are open about what they did			0
those guilty of relatively minor offences , particularly those committed several years ago and which resulted in light sentences , are likely to be let in to forces			1
applicants who try to hide what they did , or who committed serious crimes involving violence , sex offences or fraud , will continue to be barred from a career in uniform			2
and it will still be down to chief constables or personnel directors to make the final decision on a candidate			0
a spokesman for the @entity34 confirmed last night : ‘ we are looking at reviewing the national standards around vetting			0
the current vetting standards are creating barriers to people who might be interested in policing			0
we need to look at this and apply discretion for minor convictions			2
’ but critics warned the move risked damaging public trust in the service , and claimed it was unnecessary as there is no shortage of highly qualified people who want to sign up			0
@entity96 , chairman of the @entity97 , which represents rank - and - file officers , said : ‘ the public need to have the utmost confidence that police officers are of the highest calibre and integrity and i have serious and grave concerns about anything which could undermine that			0

about 1,000 serving officers have committed some offence , but most are minor infringements of motoring law			0
@entity109 rules warn , however : ‘ police forces should not recruit people with convictions , cautions and judicial or other formal disposals , which may call in to question the integrity of the applicant or the service			1
’ ahead of the new nationwide code of practice , @entity139 has already relaxed its own rules to get more black and ethnic officers on the force , so that it becomes more representative of @entity147 ’s diverse population			2
in a recent report the @entity148 said : ‘ vetting removes 1.6 per cent of all applicants from the recruitment process			1
however , it removes 4.5 per cent of @entity154 candidates			2
earlier this year the @entity155 agreed to accept a higher risk tolerance , particularly where offences occurred some time ago and which were of a minor nature			2
