@entity2 's @entity1 governor says he will ban state - funded travel to @entity4 over a controversial religious freedom law			1
' i found it disturbing , disgraceful and outright discriminatory , ' the state 's chief executive , @entity7 , said during a news conference on an unrelated issue			2
' it hearkens back to a time when states were allowed to pass laws that treated their citizens differently			0
it 's our shared past where discrimination was codified into our laws			0
' @entity2 will become the first state to bar travel to @entity4 since its governor signed the religious freedom law last thursday			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , @entity29 , have sent out similar orders , however			1
the bill , signed into law by @entity4 gov. @entity33 , has the effect of giving individuals legal cover to refuse a customer 's business if it would violate a religious belief to fulfill the request			1
civil rights groups are characterizing the law as discriminatory , particularly against @entity44 persons , and @entity46 lawmakers in the state today said they 'd be open to clarifying the bill 's intent through legislative changes			1
demonstrators gather at the @entity52 on saturday to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by governor @entity33			1

critics say it would promote discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation dueling governors : @entity2 gov. @entity7 , left , a @entity63 , said today that he would bar state - funded travel to @entity4 in light of the new law , signed by into existence last thursday by that state 's chief executive , @entity33 , a @entity46 the details of @entity2 's retaliatory measure are not yet known			1

at a press conference later that day , @entity72 said his state ' led the way to end discrimination and we should continue to be a leader in speaking out against discrimination across the entirety of the nation			2
' ' no state should use religious grounds to be the basis for discrimination in our country , ' @entity72 said , according to @entity100			2
' let me point out that it is a sad fact that in our history religion was used as a basis to support treating black and white individuals differently as well , and i wo n't allow any of our citizens in @entity2 to face discrimination in other states , at least without a fight			1
' more than 2,000 demonstrators showed up outside the @entity52 on saturday to protest the new measure passed by the @entity46 - controlled @entity114 that @entity4 says is meant to give its residents a platform to bring religious freedom suits against the government			1
the @entity119 states that ' a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion , even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability ' unless the government has a ' compelling ' interest to do so and interference is the ' least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest			2
' the @entity4 law now under a microscope says that ' a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person 's exercise of religion			1
' the only exception to that rule is if the government can show it has a ' compelling ' interest to interfere and it did so through ' the least restrictive means			0
' a party that prevails over the government in court can now ask for ' compensatory damages ' and may be awarded ' all or part of the costs of litigation , including reasonable attorney 's fees			0
' civil rights activists argue that the law is overly broad because it can be interpreted to apply not only to individuals acting in their personal capacity , but also to businesses			1

gay rights activists say such discriminatory behavior would not be allowed under @entity4 law as a result of the religious freedom bill			1
a similar bill could soon become law in @entity185			2

@entity185 's legislation stats that ' governments should not substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification			2
' @entity191 , a @entity46 , has already signaled his support for the law			1
@entity199 , which is based out of @entity185 , and @entity201 ceo @entity200 sided against the @entity46 - backed measure over the weekend			2
' we feel this legislation is counter to this core basic belief of respect for the individual and sends the wrong message about @entity185 , as well as the diverse environment which exists in the state , ' a spokesman for @entity199 said in a statement provided to @entity213			0
@entity200 publicly criticized both state 's laws on @entity73 , saying , ' @entity201 is open for everyone			2
we are deeply disappointed in @entity4 's new law and calling on @entity185 gov. to veto the similar @entity219			1
' another business , @entity221 , said it would put on hold indefinitely construction on the expansion of its @entity56 headquarters , a $ 40 million project , until the further notice			0
' @entity221 is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents , ' the company 's chief executive , @entity228 , said in a statement			2

at a news conference @entity188 speaker @entity263 and state @entity189 president @entity265 @entity264 said they would be willing to change the wording of the law to make more clear that the state does not endorse discrimination			2
' to the extent that we need to clarify that , by adding something to the law to make that clear that 's not the intent , we are more than willing to do it , and we plan to do that , ' @entity264 told reporters , per a report from @entity213			2
' religious freedom and the right to be free from discrimination can coexist together , ' he said			1
@entity33 expressed shock during an interview with the @entity290 on saturday at the national outrage that that 's followed the signing of the law			0
' i just ca n't account for the hostility that 's been directed at our state , ' he told the publication			0
' i 've been taken aback by the mischaracterizations from outside the state of @entity4 about what is in this bill			2
' by sunday the rumored presidential candidate had gone into full damage control mode , appearing on @entity306 ' sunday morning news program this week			0
but he stood his ground and would not call the law a mistake during the interview , though , and declined to say whether it could be used to legally discriminate on the basis of orientation , as gay rights activists are charging , as homosexuals are not currently a protected class under @entity4 law			1
' this is not about discrimination , this is about empowering people to confront government overreach , ' he told host @entity323			0

' from people who preach tolerance every day , we ’ve been under an avalanche of intolerance , ' he said			1
' i ’m not going to take it lying down			0
furthermore , @entity33 said @entity4 's law is similar to federal legislation @entity347 signed as president in 1993 and a measure that @entity351 voted for while serving in the @entity352			1
@entity4 's law has ' the very same language ' as the @entity355 bill the @entity1 president voted for , @entity33 contended			1
@entity351 's spokesman rejected @entity33 's comparison in an interview on the same network minutes later			0
' if you have to go back two decades to try to justify something you are doing today , it may raise some questions about the wisdom of what you ’re doing , ' @entity362 press secretary @entity361 said in response			0
' it should be easy for leaders in this country to stand up and say that it is wrong to discriminate against people just because of who they love			0
' president @entity351 notoriously ' evolved ' on the subject of gay marriage during his first term and now supports it after having previously been against it .			0
