@entity1 rugby head coach @entity0 says , by his own performance - clock measurement , that the team have made just 15 minutes ’ progress over the last year , despite saturday ’s victory over @entity6			1
@entity0 uses the clock to gauge where his team are — from the six o’clock nadir of @entity1 ’s woeful performance on and off the field in @entity12 in 2011 , when the two hands were as far apart as they can be , to the perfect alignment of noon , where he wants to be for the @entity16 on home soil			1
@entity0 judged @entity1 to be at 10pm after the autumn series in 2013 and disappointingly his watch has only moved on to 10.15pm , so the clock is ticking if they are to improve enough before the big kick - off at @entity22 on september 18			1
@entity1 head coach @entity0 ( right ) uses a performance - clock measurement to assess progress however , @entity25 is lucky in having the full support of the @entity27 , who would still have backed him if @entity1 had lost to @entity6			1
chief executive @entity30 said before the match he had every confidence in @entity25 and his staff justifying their extended six - year contracts — awarded in october — even if they suffered another blow in the autumn series			0
understandably , @entity0 said he would have preferred a different order of games during november , rather than starting with the @entity41 followed by @entity42			0
but despite his long @entity27 deal , @entity25 will have no say in the autumn fixtures arranged up to 2019			0
@entity0 shares a joke with captain @entity47 after his @entity1 side beat @entity6 on saturday @entity1 legend @entity49 chats with @entity50 as a pundit before the @entity52 on saturday @entity49 will be inundated with offers ahead of the @entity16 and has already been in talks with rights - holders @entity55 about a pundit role			1
meanwhile , @entity58 , who has taken almost a full @entity16 cycle to recover from the personal trauma of being the team manager during @entity1 ’s 2011 debacle , is slowly starting to do more rugby - related work , including some for sponsors @entity65			1
even a full return to the sport is not being ruled out for the 2003 @entity16 - winning captain			2
tv presenter @entity69 , at @entity70 on saturday , with former @entity72 @entity71 national treasure @entity69 , in contract talks aimed at cutting her @entity75 racing commitments , is still expected to present the marquee turf events next year			1
yet even super @entity69 ca n’t host the @entity79 for the @entity80 and the @entity81 for @entity82 on april 11			0
the @entity83 have shown remarkable support for 77 - year - old @entity85 , who lost his @entity87 vice-presidency and was banned for four months by the @entity87 for telling female referee @entity88 — fiancee of @entity90 official @entity89 — a ‘ woman ’s place is in the kitchen ’			0
@entity85 ’s wife @entity94 has been elected acting secretary to keep the league afloat in @entity85 ’s absence			0
@entity27 chairman @entity99 ’s idea of being controversial is calling it a ‘ challenging ’ task for @entity1 2015 to meet their extortionate £ 80million @entity16 guarantee to the @entity105			2
yet @entity99 surprisingly agreed to meet famous streaker @entity106 at @entity22			0
@entity106 made her topless run at half - time during the 1982 @entity1 v @entity6 match while captain @entity99 was giving his half - time talk on the pitch			2
it prompted scrum - half @entity113 to quip : ‘ @entity115 , some bird ’s just run on with your bum on her chest			0
’ @entity106 , who had her photograph taken with @entity99 by the @entity122 32 years after their first @entity22 encounter , was promoting a breast - cancer awareness calendar			2
@entity125 with girlfriend @entity126 watching @entity1 against @entity6 at @entity22 on saturday @entity1 rugby ’s great hope @entity125 , who made his union debut for @entity131 on friday , has embraced his new code to the extent he was at @entity22 early the next day to enjoy the traditional car - park festivities before the @entity6 game			1
and all those who know rugby league great @entity125 say that he is such a strong character and presence he would give a lift to @entity1 ’s @entity142 squad even while learning the 15 - man code			2
the @entity27 ’s obsession with milking @entity22 matches for all they are worth now extends to sending sales reps around all the hospitality boxes to sell merchandise to those who have n’t been to the superstore .			0
