the recent recession triggered a surge in suicides , particularly amongst men			1
a new study has found the financial crisis between 2008 and 2010 was responsible for thousands of deaths across @entity7 and @entity8			1
the research , published in the @entity10 , shows that suicide rates ‘ rose significantly ’ after the 2007 financial crash			1
the financial crisis was responsible for at least 10,000 suicides , new research suggests experts from the @entity16 and the @entity17 said the increase was four times higher among men than women			1
they analysed data from the @entity22 about suicides in 24 @entity25 countries , the @entity26 and @entity27			1
between 2007 , when the economic crisis began , and 2009 , suicide rates rose in @entity7 by 6.5 per cent , they found			1
the rates remained elevated until 2011			2
this corresponds to an additional 7,950 suicides than would have been expected across these @entity25 countries during this time period , they said			2
before the recession suicide rates had been falling in @entity7 , they added			1
in addition , suicide rates in @entity27 and the @entity26 rose by 4.5 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively , during the same time			1
redundancies , debt and home repossessions were the main causes of suicides related to the recession overall there were at least 10,000 additional suicides as a result of the crisis , the authors say			2
but they added that this is a conservative estimate			0
job loss , home repossession and debt are the main causes of suicide during economic downturns , they believe			2
‘ there has been a substantial rise in suicides during the recession , greater than we would have anticipated based on previous trends , ’ said lead author dr @entity60 , of @entity16 ’s @entity61			1
‘ a critical question for policy and psychiatric practice is whether suicide rises are inevitable			0
‘ this study shows that rising suicides have not been observed everywhere so while recessions will continue to hurt , they do n’t always cause self - harm			0
‘ a range of interventions , from return to work programmes through to antidepressant prescriptions , may reduce the risk of suicide during future economic downturns			0
’ co-author professor @entity85 , also from the @entity16 , added : ‘ suicides are just the tip of the iceberg			0
these data reveal a looming mental health crisis in @entity7 and @entity8			2
‘ in these hard economic times , this research suggests it is critical to look for ways of protecting those who are likely to be hardest hit			0
' most suicides are committed by people with clinical depression , and the research revealed a marked rise in antidepressant use during the economic downturn			0
in the @entity105 , prescriptions of the drugs soared by 19 per cent between 2007 and 2010			0
programmes that actively help people who are out of work appeared to reduce the number of suicides , according to the findings			0
the researchers estimated that every $ 100 ( @entity26 ) ( £ 59.57 ) spent per head on assistance for the unemployed lowered the risk of suicide by 0.4 per cent			1
during the financial crisis , the suicide rate among men rose much faster than the suicide rate among women @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 were examples of countries where suicide rate did not rise markedly despite rising unemployment during the 2008 to 2010 recession			1
in @entity121 and @entity122 the rate remained stable while in @entity120 it actually decreased			0
an earlier period of increasing unemployment in the 1990s saw suicide rates go down in both @entity121 and @entity122			1
those few industrialised countries that escaped the recession , such as @entity136 , also avoided a rise in suicides , the study found			2
in the @entity25 , the number of suicides per 100,000 of the population declined from just under 12 to around 10 between 2001 and 2006			0
then it began to rise , increasing by 6.5 per cent before levelling out in 2009/10			0
