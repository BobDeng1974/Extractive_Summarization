a perverse loophole in the @entity1 will soon make illegal immigrants more affordable to hire than native - born @entity3			1
once millions of people living in the @entity3 illegally receive resident cards and work permits , they will be eligible to hold jobs and earn wages			0
but they wo n't qualify for @entity1 benefits or subsidies			2
that means employers with 50 or more full - time workers ca n't be penalized for failing to provide them with company - based medical insurance			1
ordinarily that fine amounts to $ 3,000 per worker , per year			2
the end result is a strange , looking - glass scenario – an incentive to hire people who today ca n't legally hold jobs – that will also hand president @entity26 's political adversaries another rhetorical cudgel to beat him with			1
@entity3 's overall labor participation rate – the percentage of able - bodied working - age adults with jobs – is at its lowest since 1978 , despite rosy federal government numbers showing the official unemployment rate has decreased in recent years			0
not a problem : @entity26 insisted tuesday in @entity34 that immigration reform would grow the economy and add jobs in the long run back of the line : native - born @entity3 could find themselves with one strike against them because they will cost an extra $ 3,000 to hire if a company with 50 or more employees does n't provide insurance to all its workers the contrast is due to a @entity46 accounting trick : the agency releases a number each month after adjusting it to exclude from the labor pool everyone who has given up on finding a job in the previous six months			1
the dearth of middle - class jobs , however , persists			0
and that job market will tighten when today 's illegal immigrants become tomorrow 's job - eligible immigrants – and they ’re cheaper to hire			2
the @entity58 first reported tuesday on the odd consequence of the temporary deportation - free status @entity26 aims to confer on about 5 million illegal immigrants for three years ' if it is true that the president 's actions give employers a $ 3,000 incentive to hire those who came here illegally , he has added insult to injury , ' @entity64 @entity63 rep. @entity63 told the @entity58			1
' the president 's actions would have just moved those who came here illegally to the front of the line , ahead of unemployed and underemployed @entity3			0
' the @entity77 did not respond to a request for comment on wednesday as administration officials prepared to pardon some turkeys and brine others			0
@entity26 , however , pledged on tuesday during a speech in @entity34 that his mainstreaming of illegal immigrants will not drive down @entity3 ' wages			1
' immigrants are good for the economy , ' he said			0
' we keep on hearing that they ’re bad , but a report by my @entity92 put out last week shows how the actions we ’re taking will grow our economy for everybody			0
' the @entity58 reported that a comprehensive immigration reform bill that cleared the @entity98 last year – the one the @entity77 favored before it stalled amid partisan squabbles – created the same unusual hiring incentive			2
that bill , called the ' @entity102 ' proposal because four @entity104 and four @entity105 crafted it , gave put illegal immigrants on probationary status that conferred work eligibility but not public entitlements			1
@entity110 : illegal immigrants and their families may soon also be thanking the @entity77 for preferential treatment in the @entity3 labor market @entity115 , a spokesman for @entity117 sen. @entity116 – one of the ' eight ' – said tuesday that @entity1 's entire employer insurance mandate should be scrapped in order to ' eliminate the incentive to hire people who are ineligible for @entity1 subsidies			1
' the obamacare - immigration loophole has existed since at least 2012 as part of a @entity77 strategy to quell criticism about the preisdent 's @entity131 ( @entity130 ) program			1
@entity130 provided safe haven for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the @entity3 as children prior to mid- 2007			0
republicans howled at the time that the new swell of mainstreamed so - called ' @entity137 ' would sap resources and be a drain on public benefits , including @entity1			2
the @entity141 later carved out a special status for the @entity137 , deeming them legal residents but denying them access to benefit programs			0
@entity26 's executive actions on immigration will only apply to people who were in the @entity3 by january 1 , 2010 .			0

*bizarre* quirk makes illegal immigrants ineligible for @entity1 benefits
because of the loophole , companies ca n't be penalized for denying them employer - *funded* medical insurance
the $ 3,000 savings could drive more jobs to the millions president @entity26 is set to *protect* from deportation under his three - year ' amnesty '
' @entity102 ' immigration bill favored by the @entity77 includes the same peculiar incentive to award jobs to border - *crossers*
no - benefits rule was put into place to quell criticism after @entity26 *protect*ed hundreds of thousands of ' @entity137 ' in 2012
