by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:50 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 13:08 est , 5 december 2012 @entity3 @entity2 had threatened to rebel against the government if @entity6 pressed ahead with january 's 3p rise in fuel duty a 3p rise in fuel duty planned for january will not go ahead , easing the pressure on motorists who have seen prices at the pump soar			1
in a rare piece of good news in a grim economic statement today , @entity6 has agreed not to impose the @entity19 hike			1
mr @entity6 said he had been advised to delay the rise until april , but has instead decided to scrap it ' completely '			1
however , a planned 3p fuel duty rise for april next year will be delayed until september 2013 but will go ahead			1
if the chancellor had gone ahead with the january rise it would have added £ 2.53 to the cost of filling up a family car			2
experts say it will save the average driver £ 7.69 - a - month			1
he told @entity2 : ' that is real help for the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country			0
' with growth sluggish and borrowing higher than expected , the chancellor has little spare cash to woo voters			0
but he risked a political backlash if he had pressed ahead with the rise , because it would coincide with rail and bus fare rises , hammering families and commuters no matter how they get around			0
mr @entity6 used last year 's @entity47 to scrap a planned 3p rise in fuel duty for january 2012			1
a scheduled rise for august was cut from 5p to 3p , but in june this year he postponed it until january 2013			2
now he has decided to scrap the january rise , confirming it in today 's @entity47 in the @entity53			2
' there is a 3p - per - litre rise planned for this january			1
some have suggested we delay it until april			0
i suggest we cancel it altogether , ' he said			0
the @entity62 said delaying and scrapping series of fuel duty hikes means the cost of a litre of fuel would be 10p higher in 2014 - 15 under @entity68 than under the coalition ' there will be no 3p fuel tax rise this january			1
that is real help with the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country			0
and it will help businesses too			0
' it means that under this government we ’ll have had no increase in petrol taxes for nearly two and a half years			0
in fact they have been cut			0
' the rises were all planned by the last @entity68 government to hit drivers after they left office			0
if they had all gone ahead it would have added 13p to a litre of fuel , breaking through the £ 1.50 - a - litre mark			0
a damning report by the @entity97 think tank revealed the high cost of fuel was even encouraging people to live on benefits because driving to work makes it uneconomical to get a job			2
the study said : ‘ motoring taxes may increase welfare dependency by raising travel - to - work costs , meaning many potential workers may be better off on welfare benefits than entering employment			2
’ within certain income ranges , some workers face marginal tax rates as high as 96 per cent			0
this means that for every extra £ 1 earned , the person is better off by just four pence because of high fuel costs			1
with fuel duty and vat combined , tax makes up almost two thirds of the price drivers pay for petrol			2
this graph shows how the latest cost of petrol ( 133.19p per litre ) and diesel ( 141.06p ) stack up			0
wholesale costs were taken from 14 days ago to reflect the time it takes to reach pumps ( @entity132 , fuelpricesonline.com ) mr @entity6 signalled his intention to postpone the 3p rise last month , when dozens of conservative mps threatened to join @entity68 in a @entity53 vote on the cost of living			1

@entity150 technical director @entity149 said : ' the chancellor had little option but to listen to the voice of @entity155 motorists and businesses and scrap the 3p fuel duty rise planned for january otherwise he would have faced a national outcry			1
' the @entity150 and @entity159 have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to encourage politicians to recognise the significant impact the price of fuel is having on our lives and how it is stifling the economy , inflating retail prices and reducing our competitive position against @entity169			0
' the @entity3 mp who lead the fight against a planned 3p rise in fuel duty today thanked the chancellor for backing ' white van conservatives '			1
@entity138 , who was a vocal critic of the planned rise ahead of a @entity53 debate on the issue last month , praised @entity6 ’s move to scrap the january tax increase			1
@entity6 offered some respite for motorists has he delivered his autumn statement to mps in the @entity185 during the @entity47 , the chancellor said he was not merely postponing the 3p rise to april but scrapping it altogether			1
during questions on the statement , @entity170 mp mr @entity138 said : ' can i thank you on behalf of my colleagues and @entity193 @entity155 for putting the fuel back into the tank of white van conservatives across the country			0
' can you confirm the scrapping of the 3p petrol rise , not just for three months but permanently , will mean the average @entity170 resident is better off by £ 80 to £ 100 next year ? ' mr @entity6 replied : ' i congratulate you for speaking for motorists and families across the country against @entity68 ’s fuel tax rises			1
' you speak for @entity170 man and woman and i ’m glad , as a result of your campaigning and difficult decisions we have taken elsewhere to control public spending , we have been able to cancel altogether that fuel duty rise due for january			2
' the news that the january rise will not go ahead was also welcomed by hauliers , who warned rising fuel costs were eating into their profit margins			1
relief : motorists and hauliers will benefit after @entity6 blocked the hike @entity223 , managing director of removals firm @entity224 , said : ' the 3p - a - litre fuel duty rise , which would have come into effect in january , would have had a severely negative impact on the haulage industry and a potential loss of jobs right down the ladder			1
for me there is no argument – the fuel duty freeze had to happen and i ’m delighted that it has			2
' hard - pressed motorists have been cutting down on the miles they drive to conserve fuel , but near record levels of fuel duty have been pouring into the @entity62			1
since 1991 - 92 the amount of fuel used in the @entity155 has fallen by 20 per cent to 50.6billion litres			0
but over the same period fuel duty receipts have more than doubled from less than £ 11billion to £ 26.8billion in 2011 - 12			1
@entity246 , @entity247 president , said : ‘ drivers in the @entity155 have followed @entity250 advice to purchase more fuel efficient vehicles			0
‘ it is remarkable that fuel consumption has fallen 20 per cent in two decades			0
however , drivers are contributing 144 per cent more in fuel duty tax so should n’t be stung by another hike in january			2
’ with average @entity155 petrol prices now at 133.19p per litre , fuel duty accounts for 57.95p , according to the @entity247			2
the @entity62 is on course to rake in almost £ 27billion from fuel duty this year - the second highest ever			1
the @entity247 said the said the government should be putting its energy into tackling inflated and ‘ bloated ’ pump prices - currently at around 135p a litre - driven artificially high by ‘ speculators ’ and proving much slower to come down than go up			0
energy minister @entity265 has ordered a report into whether oil firms have rigged the market , forcing up the price of fuel for drivers			0
it will also examine the number of petrol stations which have closed and the how far drivers in rural areas have to travel to reach the pumps .			0

@entity6 decides to scrap @entity19 hike to ease pressure on motorists
@entity68 's fuel duty *escalator* would have cost the average driver an extra £ 7.69 - a - month
study warned high fuel costs made it *cheaper* for people to stay at home than go out to work
separate 3p rise planned for april 2013 now delayed until september
