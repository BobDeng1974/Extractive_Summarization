@entity9 's research examined the link between peoples ' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices such as chilli			1

@entity23 , a doctoral candidate at the university , conducted a study of 184 non-smoking participants between the ages of 18 and 45 without any known issues that would compromise their ability to taste			0
the group of people were primarily caucasian and around 63 per cent were female			2
she assessed the group using the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) test			0
this test looks at the personality trait of ' sensation - seeking '			2
this trait is defined as seeking out ' novel and intense stimulation ' regardless of the risks involved			2
people who score above the mean @entity35 score are considered more open to risks and new experiences , while those scoring below the mean are considered less open to those things			1
the subjects were then given 25 micrometers of capsaicin , the active component of chili peppers , and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity			0
those in the group who fell below the mean @entity35 rapidly disliked the meal as the burn increased			0
@entity9 's research examined the link between peoples ' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices including chill , which is found in lots of curries ( pictured ) people who were above the mean @entity35 had a consistently liked the meal even as the burn increased			1
those in the mean group liked the meal less as the burn increased , but not nearly as rapidly as those below the mean			0

' she presented her findings at the 2013 @entity91 annual meeting and food expo			0
people were given 25 micrometers of capsaicin , the active component of chili peppers , and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity			2
the research found that people who actively seek adventure and intense sensations , like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations at the same event , dr @entity107 , principal flavor chemist at @entity108 , discussed the addition of ' tingling ' spices to foods			1
the practice is not very prevalent in the @entity2 diet outside of carbonation			2
he said that ' @entity116 , ' a traditional @entity118 cuisine that combines chili peppers for their heat and @entity118 peppers for their tingle , shows promise for @entity2 food manufacturers			1
the combination of the two sensates enhances the tingling while reducing the heat , which could make certain traditionally spicy foods more appealing to consumers , he said .			0
