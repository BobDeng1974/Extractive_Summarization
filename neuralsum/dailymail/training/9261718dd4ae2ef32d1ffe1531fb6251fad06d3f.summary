by @entity0 foreign criminals are ending up with shorter jail terms than @entity5 offenders because police are failing to carry out adequate background checks , a former intelligence chief has warned			1
@entity8 , an ex-superintendent at @entity10 ’s intelligence bureau , claimed simple checks that could flag up an offender ’s criminal history overseas are being overlooked by police who are too busy			1
and he said @entity5 citizens are receiving comparatively longer sentences as a result , because their offending history is always considered in court			2
unfair : one in seven prisoners in @entity5 is a foreign national , but many receive softer sentences because police are too busy to check their past			1
a riot by foreign prisoners last month hit @entity29 , pictured calling for such checks to be ‘ routine ’ for foreign offenders , mr @entity8 pointed to a number of failings in the way police forces across the @entity5 handle such cases			1
his warning follows a spate of high - profile cases in which violent offenders have travelled freely to the @entity5 to commit brutal crimes despite their past			0
the alleged failures of police investigations could also increase concerns ahead of the @entity5 ’s decision to open its borders to migrants arriving from @entity48 and @entity49 in january			2
mr @entity8 said many forces were also regularly failing to act on @entity51 , and cited cutbacks as a factor in sub-standard investigations			1
he said that one in ten foreign nationals arrested when he worked at @entity10 was the subject of such a warrant , but they were not effectively investigated			0
concern : home affairs select committee chairman @entity60 , pictured , will explore the issue tomorrow			0
he said free movement in @entity64 ' definitely aids crime ' and courts were being left in the dark he also pointed to legislation that suggests the failure of @entity5 courts to check an alleged offender ’s criminal history could be illegal			0
speaking at a conference in @entity48 reported by the @entity74 , he said : ‘ every day hundreds of foreign nationals are arrested and the police do n’t always investigate the criminality of those people back in their own countries			2
‘ officers are under so much pressure to move on to the next case			1
we are not fully exploring intelligence opportunities and that can lead to problems			2
’ ‘ it is not fair that a @entity5 national goes to court in the @entity5 and their previous convictions are taken into account and they are given a heavy sentence			0
’ mr @entity8 , who retired from the @entity92 last year , helped to establish the police national database that allows forces to share information			1
a damning government assessment published earlier this year revealed that up to one in four organised criminals targeting @entity5 is from overseas			0
the parliamentary home affairs @entity99 will explore the issue tomorrow			0
the committee ’s chairman @entity60 echoed mr @entity8 ’s comments , saying that courts are being ' left in the dark '			1
he said that free movement in @entity64 ' definitely aids crime ' , adding : ‘ it means we are putting a lesser sentence on them than we would if we knew the whole history			0
it is a big worry			0

@entity8 : unfair that @entity115 are always checked but foreigners are not
he said police are under ' so much pressure ' to move on to the next case
former intelligence bureau chief called for checks to be *compulsory*
