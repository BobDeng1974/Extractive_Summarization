yesterday , the @entity0 made history when it landed its probe on the comet @entity3			1
the event was fraught with excitement - and nerves - after reports the probe had n't managed to anchor itself to the site			1
for one scientist it all proved a little too much			0
professor @entity14 , who helped develop tools for the @entity17 probe , was filmed jumping for joy following the announcement , shouting : ' it 's fantastic			1
i 've waited years for this and i 'm so excited , i 'm going to cry			0
' at one point , the 56 - year - old space scientist was so overcome with emotion , she was filmed turning and hugging @entity30 science editor @entity29 , for which she later apologised			1
i 've waited years for this			0
i 'm going to cry			0
' at one point , she was so overcome with emotion , she was filmed hugging @entity30 science editor @entity29 ( pictured ) the successful landing was the result of a decade of research and development , including a 4 billion mile ( 6.4 billion km ) journey			1
professor @entity47 , from the @entity46 , was part of a team which developed a tool used in the project called @entity52			1
the tool , which is the size of a shoebox , is fitted to @entity17 and will be used to analyse the composition of samples and gases from the 4.5 billion - year - old comet			1
once she calmed down , she said to mr @entity29 : ' now i 'll try and be a professional scientist			1
' this is an amazing moment in @entity0 history			0
it 's just so wonderful , we 've waited so long and now it 's happening			1
' her colleague professor @entity65 added : ‘ the idea that comets may have brought the building blocks of life to @entity71 is one of the reasons why we want to study them			0
’ professor @entity47 , from the @entity46 , was part of a team which developed a tool used in the project called @entity52 ( pictured bottom left )			1
@entity52 , which is the size of a shoebox , is fitted to @entity17 and will be used to analyse the composition of samples and gases from the 4.5 billion - year - old comet scientists hope the £ 1billion project will solve some of the greatest puzzles in science – including the origins of life on @entity71			1
launched in march of 2004 , the @entity93 spacecraft travelled over an arching orbit , that took it beyond the orbit of @entity98 on its way to the @entity100 – @entity101			0
however , controllers revealed that because harpoons supposed to tether it to the surface had not fired , the lander may have actually bounced , effectively landing twice - and leaving it attached only by screws on its legs			0
' it 's complicated to land on a comet , and complicated to understand what has happened during this landing , ' said dr @entity115 , @entity116			2
the probe separated from the craft yesterday morning , and at the @entity0 ’s mission control in @entity121 , a faint radio signal came back from the lander at 4pm gmt. the @entity124 astronomer @entity123 ( right ) , one of the discoverers of the comet @entity127 , and @entity0 general director @entity128 ( left ) hug each other at the satellite control center of the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) in @entity131 , @entity121 yesterday the probe separated from the craft yesterday morning , and a faint radio signal came back from the lander at 4pm gmt. there were fears that @entity17 was unstable , after thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire			1
but , earlier this morning @entity0 announced it had made contact with the probe , and released this image at mission control in @entity121 , the news of the landing was greeted with jubilation and high emotion by staff on the project			2
it is thought @entity17 is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown @entity155 , the principal investigator on @entity93 's @entity157 instrument , told @entity158 this was the proof the team needed that it had finally reached the surface of the comet			1
dr @entity163 , who ran the audacious landing programme , said early tests suggested the craft had bounced softly before turning and settling again			0
he said : ‘ it touched down and was re-bouncing			0
so maybe we did n’t just land , we landed twice			0
’ there were fears last night that @entity17 was unstable , after the landing thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire			2
however , earlier this morning @entity0 announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is			2
it is thought @entity17 is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown and there is a ' chance it is on its side ' , @entity155 , the principal investigator on @entity93 's @entity157 instrument , told @entity158			1
‘ from what we ’ve heard overnight it seems there is a suspicion yesterday that there was some bouncing involved			0
‘ two instruments have confirmed @entity17 appears to have touched down followed by two subsequent touchdowns effectively			2
@entity93 has chased comet @entity100 – @entity101 through space for more than ten years in what has been described as ' the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever ' the lander announced its arrival with this historic tweet following its ten - year mission			1
launched in march of 2004 , the @entity93 spacecraft travelled over an arching orbit , that took it beyond the orbit of @entity98 on its way the lander was dropped from a height of 13.6 miles ( 21.8 km )			0
this image shows @entity209 from a distance of approximately 1.8 miles ( 3km ) from the surface ‘ so the fact we ’re now getting data back from the orbiter looks good , it suggests the lander is stable on the surface			0
the probe bounced twice on the surface after the landing yesterday , once to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) , before coming to rest on the comet			1
dr @entity115 , @entity116 said : ‘ did we just land in a soft - sand box and everything is fine ? or is there something else happening ? we still do not fully understand what has happened			0
’ @entity227 scientist dr @entity226 , who played a key role in the mission , said : ‘ to see this mountaineering effort , that we ’ve descended a lander to the surface of a comet , i ca n’t put words to it			2
’ and the expert was so confident of success that he had even had an image of the space probe tattooed on his right leg			2
there were fears last night that @entity17 was unstable , after landing thrusters and anchoring harpoons failed to fire			2
however , earlier this morning @entity0 announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is when @entity17 touched the surface of the comet it fired harpoons into the surface to keep it anchored there			1
to keep it attached to the surface a thruster at the top was meant to push it down as the harpoons fired			0
but before the launch , the thruster did n't appear to be working - and it was confirmed the harpoons did n't fire			0
this meant the lander may have had to rely solely on screws on its legs			0
the surface was much softer than they expected , so there were some concerns that @entity17 was not securely fixed on the comet - although from a software point of view things seemed to be fine			1
however , earlier this morning @entity0 announced it had made contact with the probe - but questions still remain about how secure it is			2
it is thought @entity17 is currently resting on the surface of the comet but its orientation is unknown and there is a ' chance it is on its side ' , @entity155 , the principal investigator on @entity93 's @entity157 instrument , told @entity158			1
‘ from what we ’ve heard overnight it seems there is a suspicion yesterday that there was some bouncing involved			0
‘ two instruments have confirmed @entity17 appears to have touched down followed by two subsequent touchdowns effectively			2
before the attempt yesterday , there was also a good luck message from a man who had once boasted of boldly going into space himself			2
@entity302 actor @entity301 sent the team a video in which the 83 - year - old said : ‘ good luck @entity93 , @entity17 ’s gon na land			1
’ one scientist then described the seven hours of ‘ terror ’ they went through to drop the @entity17 lander 13.6 miles above the comet from its mothership , @entity93			1
much of the equipment aboard the lander was switched on for the first time after lying dormant during the ten - year journey			1
@entity317 , one of the @entity124 who discovered the comet 45 years ago and named it , said from mission control in @entity131 , @entity121 : ‘ we saw the first light from this comet in 1969 , now we are landing on it			0
it is a fantastic , outstanding event , the first like it in human civilization			0
’ the probe is equipped with cameras , a suite of ten instruments , and a drill that can bore out samples to a depth of nine inches .			0

professor @entity14 was filmed following the announcement the @entity17 probe successfully landed on the comet *67p* yesterday
space scientist helped develop a tool used in the project called @entity52
the tool will analyse the composition of samples on board the comet
she is seen jumping for joy and repeating : ' it 's fantastic , it 's wonderful '
the 56 - year - old then hugs @entity30 science editor @entity29 , for which she later apologised
