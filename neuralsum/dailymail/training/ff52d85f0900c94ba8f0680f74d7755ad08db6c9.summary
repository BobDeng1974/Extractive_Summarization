a police commissioner who created @entity2 's first youth crime tsars is set to drop the post after the role became mired in controversy			1
@entity7 police and crime commissioner @entity8 chose 17 - year - old @entity9 as the @entity2 's first youth police and crime commissioner in april 2013			1
miss @entity9 was forced to step down from the £ 15,000 - a - year job just a week later after complaints about allegedly violent , racist and anti-gay comments on @entity15			1
she had to be suspended in june last year when it emerged she had a close friendship with married ex-local councillor @entity37 , 50			1
miss @entity17 has since returned to her duties , liaising between the police and youth groups and charities			1
since her reinstatement , miss @entity17 has travelled across @entity7 meeting school children , youth groups and sporting organisations			1
on her documentary : ' the only reason i agreed to do the documentary was to help people better understand the role of police and crime commissioner			2
it is very complex and there are lots of challenges			0
unfortunately i do n't think the programme did that and i 'm deeply sorry '			0
when asked about her job : ' oh dear , what is a police commissioner ? right , well it 's not the police commissioner , it 's the @entity66			2
' it 's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do , but there is no actual job description			2
' on what her ' @entity75 ' meant : ' oh @entity77 , i 've got no idea - i ca n't tell you actually - i was n't thinking i 'd be talking about the actual onion ( the concentric circles ) as we call it - umm i do n't know know really - everything 's important			0
' on her @entity87 battle bus : ' my budget is £ 317million , £ 15,000 is money well spent - i could have had a top of range @entity91 , but it 's not my image			0
' mrs @entity8 was then seen driving her personal @entity91			0
on resignation of @entity9 : ' i was not recruiting an angel			0
i was not recruiting a police officer			0
i was recruiting a young person , warts and all			0
it is personally sad for @entity100 and her family ' but her 12 - month contract ends on march 5 and it is thought unlikely she will be replaced			0
discussions are due to take place about an exact date for miss @entity17 's departure			1
there have so far been no moves to re-advertise the post publicly			0
a spokesman for the commissioner 's office said : ' the exact arrangements around her last day have yet to be made , but there is no replacement lined up			2
' once @entity17 has left , the commissioner will decide what to do			2
that decision has not been taken yet			0
' the post was originally set up so that the views of young people could be better represented in relation to policing in @entity7			0
writing on her blog , ms @entity8 said during her year in office , miss @entity17 completed ' an excellent piece of primary research ' which is due to be published shortly			1
she said : ' i have already incorporated some of @entity17 ’s advice into the 2015/16 refresh of my police and @entity134 which sets the strategic direction for @entity133			0
' ms @entity8 said the recommendations included officer and staff training around their interaction with young people			1
she also proposed that ' partners ' should encourage the use of shared open spaces ' in a safe and not anti-social way '			0
ms @entity8 said her youth crime tsar also made recommendations on how to reach young people with crime prevention and safety messages			1
miss @entity17 is returning to @entity149 following her time in the role			1
the @entity151 has announced that ms @entity152 will not face prosecution for driving without insurance despite finding ' she may have committed the offence '			1
the @entity156 launched the probe after ms @entity8 was involved in a road traffic collision on september 16 , on @entity159 , @entity160			2
at the time of the crash , ms @entity8 was driving her own personal car and investigators had to decide wither the she had obstructed a police officer ' in the execution of their duty '			1
a file on the incident was sent to the @entity151 who had to determine whether ms @entity152 had made a ' technical breach ' of her insurance conditions because the collision happened on a trip between a shop and a meeting			1
a @entity151 spokesperson said : ' although some further investigation might assist in determining whether there would be sufficient evidence to prosecute this matter , we are not advising that any further inquiries take place as in any event we consider that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute			1
' the alleged breach of insurance conditions is technical in nature and focuses on whether the purpose of the trip could be defined as business or personal and we consider that to be far from clear			2
' in this case the insurance company did not consider that the conditions of the insurance policy were breached so as to make any claim invalid , and has indicated it will pay the claim ( although in fact the other party was deemed to be liable )			0
' it follows that we have advised there should be no prosecution			0
