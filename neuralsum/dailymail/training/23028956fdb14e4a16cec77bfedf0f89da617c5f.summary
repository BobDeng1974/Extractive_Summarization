by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:32 pm on 21st january 2012 a man cleared of murdering two soldiers in @entity4 has claimed his dna was planted in the getaway car			1
@entity7 , 44 , said the charges against him were ‘ spurious ’ but refused to condemn dissident republicans			1
it is the third time he has beaten terror charges in 20 years			1
he was acquitted of shooting @entity12 , 21 , and @entity13 , 23 , as they collected pizza at the gates of @entity18 barracks in @entity19			1
cleared : @entity7 , who was cleared of a separate murder charge 20 years ago , was acquitted of the same charges as @entity22 @entity7 , 44 , first hit the headlines 20 years ago after he was cleared of an @entity25 murder			1
co-accused @entity22 was yesterday convicted of murdering the two sappers outside @entity18 army barracks in march 2009			1
the trial judge said there was a ' strong suspicion ' @entity7 , 44 , was involved in the @entity25 plot to kill the servicemen in march 2009			1
even though his dna was found on a seat buckle and the tip of a latex glove found in the getaway car there was not enough evidence to convict him of taking part in the ' murderous attack '			1
but today , he told a news conference : ‘ i am firmly of the view that my dna arose there because it was planted			2
i was never in that car			2
‘ i state quite categorically here that i had no involvement in what happened at @entity18 , no involvement whatsoever , and that has been vindicated in court because there was no credible evidence to suggest otherwise			2
’ asked about republican violence , he said : ' this is a legacy issue here in relation to what has taken place in @entity4 in a historic context and far be it for me to be the person who can end all of this armed struggle and all the rest of it , these are issues for these particular groups out there			2
' he added : ' i am not into condemning these groups or anything like that because i do n't believe there is any value in that			0
i do not support them either but i am not into the politics of condemnation			0
' @entity7 said hostility from families of the dead sappers came after they had been fed information by the ' forces of the state '			1
' they are feeding them tittle tattle and rumour and innuendo			0
' the soldiers ' families broke down in court as @entity7 , who has long - standing connections with terror groups in @entity95 , walked free			2
in 1996 the @entity96 quashed the @entity99 republican 's conviction and life sentence for murdering a former @entity102 soldier @entity101			0
he had spent three years in custody , almost the same length of time he has been on remand over the @entity18 murders			2
a year later he had charges of killing two policemen , @entity110 and @entity111 , dropped due to insufficient evidence before any trial			1
killed : sappers @entity13 , left , and @entity13 , were shot head as they went to collect a pizza outside the @entity4 barracks @entity118 , the sister of dead soldier @entity13 , comforting her mother @entity121 , as @entity123 's comrades make an emotional return to their @entity4 barracks after a six - month tour of @entity127 in 2009 @entity129 @entity13 's mother @entity128 at his former barracks in @entity4 despite the @entity131 hearing a police claim @entity7 was a driving force in the north @entity134 , he denied ever having been a member and claimed that he had been persecuted by the police			1
before his release , @entity7 had been on remand in @entity138 where he has been on a no - wash dirty protest against his continued incarceration			2
terminally - ill @entity22 was found guilty of murdering @entity141 , from @entity142 , and @entity144 , from @entity145 , just hours before they were due to deploy to @entity127 with 38 engineer @entity146			1
guilty : @entity22 , 46 , pictured at an earlier court hearing , was convicted of the double killing of two @entity151 soldiers @entity22 , a drinker and gambler who suffers from cystic fibrosis , was also found guilty of six counts of attempted murder and one of possession of firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life by judge @entity164 after a six - week trial without a jury			1
he was sentenced to life in prison			0
the @entity25 , a @entity169 splinter group opposed to the peace process , claimed responsibility for the ambush , which left four others injured			0
mr @entity174 said @entity22 , 46 , had invented an alibi for his movements on the night of the murders by claiming he had a @entity179 meal and attended @entity181 mass. but his dna was found on struck matchsticks recovered from the back seat of the partially burned - out @entity185 used in the attack			1
it had been dumped and torched eight miles from the scene in a bid to cover the gunmen ’s tracks			0
doctors have given @entity22 , from @entity193 in @entity194 , between three and four years to live so he is likely to die behind bars			1
@entity7 , from @entity99 , @entity196 , refused to give evidence			1
he was acquitted of the same catalogue of charges			0
mr @entity174 , sitting at @entity200 , said the prosecution had failed to link the defendant to the murder plot			0
he said : ‘ there must be strong suspicion @entity7 did know what was going to happen			2
however suspicion , no matter how strong , is not sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt			0
‘ i consider there is insufficient evidence to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that whatever @entity7 may have done when he wore the latex glove , or touched the seatbelt buckle , meant that he was preparing the car in some way for this murderous attack			1
’ @entity141 ’s mother @entity216 , 58 , said : ‘ this was a terrible crime			0
losing @entity219 has devastated our family and cast a dark shadow over our lives			0
’ @entity144 ’s sister @entity118 said the murders were a ‘ vicious , cowardly act ’ and said : ‘ we have come a little closer to justice			0
’ another prominent republican is to be tried in connection with the @entity18 murders , while police suspect at least one more person was involved			0
@entity234 bomber @entity233 has been charged with providing property for the purposes of terrorism and earlier this week a judge ruled there was a prima facie case against her as he returned her for trial			0
the 57 - year - old former @entity25 hunger striker , who along with her sister @entity244 was jailed in 1973 for her role in a republican bombing campaign in @entity142 , allegedly provided a mobile phone for the @entity18 murder gang			2
and police also believe one member of that gang was a son of self - confessed republican killer @entity252			0
the claim that one of his sons drove the getaway car used in the gun attack was made by a defence barrister during the six - week trial of @entity7 and @entity22			1
@entity261 , representing @entity7 , told the court : ' police hold reliable information to indicate that a son of @entity266 was the driver of the vehicle which was subsequently recovered by police and was used in the fatal shooting of two soldiers in @entity19 on march 7 2009			2
' @entity271 , 34 , and @entity272 , 35 , were both arrested and questioned by police investigating the murders but neither was charged			0
@entity271 has denied the criminal allegations made against him during the trial and has indicated his intention to make formal complaints to the @entity280 and the @entity281 over the references about him made in open court			0
his father , @entity284 , was a notorious member of republican splinter group the @entity285 .			0
