by @entity0 in an incredible act of generosity , a mother offered to act as a surrogate for her ex-husband ’s new wife			1
@entity7 , 34 , offered to carry @entity9 ’ baby after the 33 - year - old was left infertile by cervical cancer treatment			1
@entity7 , who had previously been married to @entity9 's husband , @entity12 , even went through gruelling @entity14 treatment to have the couple ’s embryos implanted into her womb			1
@entity7 ( left ) offered to carry @entity9 ' baby after the 33 - year - old ( right ) was left infertile by treatment for cervical cancer			1
@entity7 was the ex-wife of @entity9 's husband , @entity12 @entity9 told @entity22 : ‘ @entity7 is a very motherly sort of person and we had grown quite close			1
‘ she understood my need to be a mum			0
but , despite this , i was mind - blown when she offered to be our surrogate			2
’ @entity9 , from @entity31 in @entity32 , and her husband , @entity12 , had been trying for a baby for a year when she started to suffer bleeding after sex			1
the veterinary nurse , who was desperate for a child , visited her doctor who told her that she had a polyp which was probably responsible for the bleeding			0
she had the polyp removed but , devastatingly , tests revealed it was cancerous			0
at the age of just 27 , @entity9 was diagnosed with cervical cancer			1
at the age of 27 @entity9 was told she had cervical cancer and that the treatment would leave her unable to carry children			1
before starting treatment she had some of her eggs harvested and had some embryos frozen when @entity7 ( pictured with her son @entity52 ) heard about @entity9 's situation , she offered to act as a surrogate			1
she went through two rounds of @entity14 to have the frozen embryos implanted into her womb she said : ‘ i was devastated , but it was more the fact it would leave me childless , than the cancer itself , that worried me			1
’ @entity61 had to have chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as surgery to remove some of her lymph nodes			0
as a result of the radiotherapy she was told she would not be able to carry a child and would go into early menopause			0
she was desperate to have a baby so she delayed her treatment to allow her to harvest some of her eggs and freeze some embryos			1
tragically , both cycles of the treatment failed and @entity7 ( pictured with her new partner , @entity76 ) did not become pregnant with @entity9 's baby she says that no one wanted her to do this as everyone , including her doctors , felt it would be better for her to start treatment immediately			1
despite this , she delayed her treatment for a month to enable her to have the procedure carried out			0
she said : ‘ for me there was so point having cancer treatment if i could n’t have a baby so there was no question about it			1
’ once @entity9 had recovered from her cancer treatment , she started to look into her fertility options			1
incredibly , at this point @entity7 , who has five of her own children , offered to be a surrogate			1
she said : ‘ watching them go through cancer was hard and i got close to @entity9			1
‘ the thought of them not being able to have a baby was awful and it was the thought of what i could give them at the end that made me want to do it			0
’ @entity7 , who lives in @entity108 , added that she was n’t worried about the thought of having to hand the baby over once it was born as it would n’t be hers genetically and she had worked it out in her mind			2
eventually , in 2010 , @entity7 went through two round of @entity14 during each of which she had two of @entity9 ’s embryos implanted into her womb			1
tragically , neither of the ivf cycles worked and @entity7 did n't become pregnant			2
@entity9 said : ‘ it was devastating when the pregnancy test was negative			2
‘ i collapsed in a heap the second time as i knew i had no more frozen eggs to try			0
@entity9 said : ' it was devastating when the pregnancy test was negative			2
i collapsed in a heap the second time as i knew i had no more frozen embryos to try ' ‘ i was grateful for everything she had done			2
’ @entity7 added : ‘ it was dreadful , it was awful – it really was heart - breaking			2
‘ she took it hard but she was strong with it			0
‘ i felt really responsible and i felt i was letting her down			0
’ she added : ‘ it did n’t really matter that the father would have been my ex-husband – it did raise a few eyebrows though			0
’ @entity9 and @entity7 are still friends and @entity9 has now been given the five year all clear from her cervical cancer			1
however , sadly , her marriage to @entity12 broke down as she wanted to look into adoption and he did n’t			0
she now has a new partner , @entity147 , and the pair are considering adoption			0
since the failed @entity14 treatment , @entity9 has broken up with @entity12 ( pictured with his son , @entity52 ) and she had her new partner , @entity147 , are now looking into adoption @entity9 said : ‘ a baby would be the ideal situation as i would like the experience of having a baby but we would consider a child of any age			1
‘ i would love to have two eventually			0
’ @entity9 is holding a night in fundraising event to raise money for @entity163 as the charity supported her when she was ill. the charity ’s night in idea sees people have friends round for an evening and they each donate what they would have spent on a night out			2
@entity9 said : ‘ i want to give something back to the charity that helped me			2
‘ a lot of women do n’t talk about female cancer and @entity175 gave me useful advice and emotional support			0
’ @entity9 will be hosting a night in for @entity175 on friday 16th may			0
the event is simply about having friends round for a catch up , a laugh and something to eat and drink			0
a @entity175 spokesperson said : ' the beauty of it is that you do n’t have to train , get sweaty or even have to hassle people to sponsor you			0
' everyone just gives what they ’d have spent on a night out and the money goes to help people keep on living life during and after cancer			0
