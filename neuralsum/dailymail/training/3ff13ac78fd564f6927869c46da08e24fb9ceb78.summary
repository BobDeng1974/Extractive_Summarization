lord @entity9 ruled his case must be reopened to consider two key issues			1

the second concerns whether it would be ' unjust and oppressive ' to extradite @entity1 ' regardless of the prognosis ' of his mental condition			1
lord @entity9 said the further hearing should take place ' as soon as possible '			0
legal experts said the renewed hearing , which could lead to appeals all the way to the @entity45 , could delay any possibility of @entity1 being extradited for months , if not years			1
