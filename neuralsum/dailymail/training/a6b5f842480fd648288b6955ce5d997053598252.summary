by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 3 september 2012 updated : 06:43 est , 3 september 2012 the @entity1 is expected to be unveiled next week - and rumours claim @entity3 has completely redesigned its iconic headphones for the first time since 2006			1
@entity8 blogsite @entity6 posted a video of what it claims are newly - designed headphones for the next @entity1 , which is expected to launch on september 12			1
if confirmed , it is the first major redesign of the distinctive white headphones since the @entity1 launched , other than the addition of an in - line microphone and remote control in 2008			1
the headphones , which come bundled with ipods and @entity19 , are one of the most iconic parts of @entity3 's product line - up , and are perhaps most famous for appearing in the famous ' dancing silhouettes ' adverts for the @entity25			0
are these the next @entity1 headphones ? @entity8 site @entity6 said @entity3 's distinctive ' buds are being produced at the @entity8 @entity30 factory old versus new : the newer model ( on the left ) have a smaller , one - piece design @entity6 has sources from within @entity3 suppliers ' @entity8 - based factories , such as the parts - based @entity30 company			2
@entity39 translated the video commentary , which states : ' in my hands are the new earphones for the @entity1 that is about to come out			2
' these will replace the current earphones that are on the market			0
' they have the appearance of a horse 's head , not like earbuds			0
when they are worn , they have a much smaller profile			0
they have the appearance of a fully integrated , single unit - there 's no part that looks like it would come apart - not like earbuds ; the integrated design is characteristic of @entity3 products			0
' all factors such as design , quality finishing materials fabricated wire , plastic body headphones are led to the conclusion this is genuine and not counterfeit headphones			0
' could this be your next wallet ? analysts say the ribbons spotted at the top of this @entity1 prototype point to an ' @entity79 ' chip inside the @entity1 is also expected to come with a built - in chip which can serve as your credit or debit card for small payments			1
@entity86 - eyed fans looking at leaked images of the internals of the device have spotted what they believe is an @entity79 chip within the phone			1
@entity79 is seen as the successor to the chip - and - pin , serving as a small contactless card which can be waved against scanners at tills to automate a payment			1
some debit cards already have this feature installed , and certain retailers such as @entity103 already use the technology			0
other phones have come with in - built @entity79 , with @entity105 making a big play for the market with its ' @entity109 ' accounts in the @entity110			2
but recent history shows that @entity3 needs to embrace a technology before it sees widespread adoption among the public , and it could take an ' @entity116 ' feature to spark a new payment system into life			0
@entity119 , which has credible sources within the notoriously - secret @entity3 , has found references to @entity79 code within @entity1 prototypes , and they have spotted ' @entity79 connectors ' within purported images of the phone 's hardware			1
@entity128 speculates that ' @entity3 could tie in with a payment processor like @entity131 â€™s @entity130 for credit card transactions - or it could become a payment processor of sorts with its hundreds of millions of credit cards already on file at @entity138			1
' @entity79 has other useful benefits to users , such as instantly transferring documents or images between phones simply by tapping them together , as demonstrated by rival @entity147 's ' @entity146 ' feature on the recent @entity149 3			2
change : this picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new @entity1 , with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete			0

@entity1 also expected to have @entity79 chip that could turn it into a credit card
