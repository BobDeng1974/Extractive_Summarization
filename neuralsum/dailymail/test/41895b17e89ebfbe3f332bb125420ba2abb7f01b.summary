they ’re the ultimate status symbol for the ultra-rich , but superyacht owners or charter clients are n’t content to just sip margaritas in the sun or watch films in their on - board cinemas			1
they spare no expense or detail when they throw extravagant parties and they go to great lengths to one - up fellow members of the world ’s one per cent or impress their celebrity guests			1
money is no object to those who like to flaunt their massive wealth at sea , and that means sales and charter brokerages are kept busy with outrageous requests for everything from high - end food and entertainment to luxurious decor and special guests			1
the strange ones are demanding , particularly when food has to be sent from one place to another at the last minute			2
‘ when you ’re doing requests like this you ’re paying considerably more than if you were to organise it in advance			2
but then again , as people say , this is yachting			2
’ in a fast - pace world where brokers expect the unexpected , these are some of the most outrageous requests from superyacht owners and charter clients			1

under the care of trained professionals , the tigers were held in glass cages on the aft deck , allowing partygoers to pose for selfies with the animals in the background			1
mr @entity35 said the biggest challenges were sorting out the insurance and paperwork , and lifting the tigers onto the superyacht			1
hoisting caged tigers onto a yacht is n’t covered by the normal premiums			1
mr @entity35 said : ‘ getting them physically onto the yacht was an issue because they had to lift them using cranes			2
‘ the people who owned the tigers were wary to allow other people to operate the machinery , and it took several weeks of paperwork once we found a specialist insurer			1
’ mr @entity35 said the tigers were rented from a circus and were taken off the yacht after the party ended			1
he said : ‘ it went off without a hitch in the end , but it was an awful lot of work on our end			2
but that ’s what we do , that ’s what we ’re paid for			2
’ @entity36 arranged for fresh fruit and vegetables to be flown from the @entity120 to the @entity121 special delivery – from @entity123 to the @entity121 it ’s the comforts of home that people miss the most when they travel for long periods , but that is n’t a problem for the world ’s super-rich			1
one client had a week ’s worth of fruit and vegetables sent from their favourite shop in the @entity139 straight to their superyacht in the @entity121			1
of course , the container had a travel experience that most people will never have – it was flown from @entity123 to the island nation in the @entity146 by private jet			1
once it arrived in the @entity121 it was loaded into a helicopter and delivered to the superyacht , where it landed on one of its decks			1
mr @entity35 said there was ‘ nothing fancy ’ about the food , which arrived undamaged and fresh			1
the owner just wanted a familiar taste from back home			1
he said : ‘ the value of the food on the flight was significant less than the value of the flight			0
’ three ' a-list ' musical acts were hired to perform at a private party that took four months to plan party on a desert island one client wanted to have a huge party on a deserted island for 80 friends and family members , so a team of engineers had to be flown out to set up a stage and other amenities			1

some owners have built classrooms on board and hired teachers for around - the - world voyages sailing around the world in a floating classroom superyacht owners do n’t let their children ’s education get in the way of their ambitious plans for an around - the - world family holiday			1

mr @entity35 said some owners have had small classrooms built within their superyachts so their children can keep up with their studies			2
they have also hired teachers to deliver lessons while travelling to some of the most exotic places on @entity225			2
for the teachers , it is an incredible way to see the world while getting paid and not having to pay for a home or utility bills			0
mr @entity35 said : ‘ [ @entity231 ] varies enormously on things such as age and the amount of holiday they get , but you ’d be looking at certainly a minimum of £ 50,000			0
’ great @entity120 @entity239 baking an eight - tier cake is a very complex and time - consuming process , and a boulangerie in the @entity139 had just 24 hours to prepare one after a ‘ last - minute ’ request			0
the cake , decorated with edible flowers , was prepared in a hurry for a guest ’s birthday party in @entity249 in the @entity120			2
mr @entity35 said : ‘ they were working flat - out to make this thing , and it required a lot of convincing on our part to convince them to do it			0
‘ this eight - tier monster cake looked like a bouquet almost , with lots of very intricately designed and hand - cut edible flowers			0
it was impressive to say the least			0
’ one crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons for a girl 's birthday party ‘ a sea of pink and silver ’ sticking with the birthday theme , @entity36 once received a request to organise a surprise birthday party for an owner ’s granddaughter			1
the crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons , using compressed air tanks , as it was the only time the youngster was off the vessel			0

it was a huge panic and a rush , and they had to bring in a few guys to help from other yachts			0

but he was not a fan , so he gifted the beautiful piano to his friend ( who we ’ll call mr @entity307 )			0
the only problem was that mr @entity311 ’s yacht was in @entity312 and mr @entity307 ’s was in @entity313			0
instead of waiting until the yachts were in the same port , a team from @entity292 was brought in to dismantle the piano , package it and transport it across @entity69 to mr @entity307 ’s yacht , where they put it together			2
the cost of dismantling and moving the piano was nearly the same as purchasing a new one			0
