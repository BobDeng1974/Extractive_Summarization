now @entity8 and wife , @entity10 , are still happily nestled in their extravagant bamboo - lined bunker in @entity14 , having raised two children there and , not only , saved on energy costs but survived scores of savage storms			1
during the @entity23 oil embargo of 1973 and 1974 , the @entity8 's , like the rest of the @entity21 , were struggling with the high price of fuel and looking for ways to cut usage			1
home sweet home : @entity8 walks out the front door of his underground home in @entity30 , @entity2 , on tuesday , july 16 , 2013 then mr @entity8 read a magazine article about how underground living reduced the cost of heating and cooling and they were intrigued			1
' we told our families , and they did n't tell us we were crazy , ' he laughed in an interview with @entity40			0
' we were young and did n't know what we were doing			0
' the couple set to work in 1975 , when their daughter @entity45 , was born , building the intriguing residence themselves , mostly on weekends			2
they moved in eight years later , in 1983 -- the year their son , @entity50 , was born			0
and even then the house was ' a work in progress			0
' decades underground : the @entity8 's have spent the last 30 years living in an underground house they built themselves over an eight - year span ' by then , i think the inspector just felt sorry for us so he let us move in , ' mr @entity8 , who is now a grandparent , told @entity61			1
the house is constructed of concrete walls that are heavily waterproofed			0
the roof area is decorated with tropic plants , such as banana trees and several types of elephant ears and bamboo , which mr @entity8 started growing commercially 15 years ago and now ships all over the country			1
the only help the couple hired was a plumber , a concrete block layer , and someone to smooth the concrete floors and roof slab of the 2,500 square foot house			2
oil embargo : during the oil embargo in the 1970s , the @entity8 's and the rest of the country were struggling with the high price of fuel and looking for ways to cut usage everything else , they did themselves , according to an earlier article from @entity92			1
as for energy efficiency , mr @entity8 said the home is easy and cheap to cool in the summer though humidity can be a problem			1
the couple installed a furnace a few years ago to heat the property they also have underground power and utility lines			2
but @entity103 said the shelter the home provides from wild weather was a huge benefit they overlooked			2
inside : @entity8 read a magazine article that talked about how underground living cut the cost of heating and cooling and he was intrigued ' i did n't realize how much i 'd appreciate the fact that it 's storm proof , ' she said			2
' these last few tornadoes i tell the kids to come down when ever there 's a bad storm			0
we usually have a houseful of people when the weather 's really bad			0
' mr @entity8 still marvels at the house the couple built so boldly all those years ago , after simply reading book after book on architecture and construction			1
' i was in my 20s , ' he said			0
' there is something wonderful about youth - you just get up and go			0
it was fun in a way			0
