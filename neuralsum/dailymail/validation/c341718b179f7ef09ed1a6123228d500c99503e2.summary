the need to anoint @entity2 the greatest player there has ever been every time he has a good game is becoming rather tedious			1
yes , @entity2 is a genius			1
every time i see him play live , it is a privilege			1
i try to make sure the memories are burned into my consciousness			2
he is the kind of player who lifts the spirit with everything he does			2
he is a quite prodigious goalscorer , a wizard of a dribbler and a provider for others			2
and yes , he was mesmerising against @entity23 at the @entity24 on wednesday night			1
the way he nutmegged @entity26 , the way he turned @entity28 before @entity29 saved from him at point - blank range , the caressed curling ball to @entity32 for the @entity34 winner			2
it is normal for people to want to believe that what they are witnessing has never been matched before			2
‘ everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home , ’ said @entity39 once , and now everybody believes there has never been a footballer as pretty as @entity2			1
@entity2 showcases his magnificent ball control with an audacious nutmeg of @entity26 @entity2 renders @entity28 to the status of an open - mouthed ball - watcher during another masterclass @entity2 awaits the ball as he inspired the @entity54 club to reach another @entity55 last eight @entity2 forces his way past @entity57 and @entity58 during @entity34 's cruise against @entity23 what saddens me about the relentless championing of @entity2 , though , is that the idea there has never been anyone to match him has become such an aggressive orthodoxy			1
any dissent is met with untrammelled scorn and dismissive disbelief			2
it is as though @entity2 has become a god and the idea that he might have a rival is sacrilege			1
as a football fan , i worship @entity2 , too , but i do n’t think he ’s the best there ’s ever been			1
it ’s too early for that			1
he ’s only 27 but he has not yet achieved what many of the other greats of the game achieved , either for club or country			1
a graphic circulated on social media recently that showed all the records @entity2 had broken			1
@entity87 top goal - scorer , @entity34 top goalscorer , @entity90 top goalscorer			2
but individual stats are not everything			2
@entity95 , ultimately , is about winning things			0
if you are a great individual player , there is a wider test of greatness in inspiring your team to win trophies			0
in the argument about football ’s best ever , @entity2 is vulnerable here			1
@entity107 , for instance , scored 1,000 goals in his career			0
but the test of his greatness was that he won the @entity112 three times with @entity114			0
three times over a 12 - year span			0
it might have been four if he had not been hacked out of the 1966 tournament			0
@entity2 has never been able to lift @entity119 to a @entity112 victory as @entity121 , another rival for the ‘ best ever ’ , did in 1986			1
at last year ’s tournament in @entity114 , where @entity119 made the final , @entity2 produced some wonderful moments but he was not even his team ’s best player			1
@entity127 and @entity128 shared that honour			0
@entity107 is hoisted aloft after winning his third @entity112 in 1970 with that peerless @entity114 side @entity121 lifted @entity119 to their second @entity112 in eight years with his tour de force in @entity133 @entity2 reached the @entity112 final with @entity119 but was unable to grab the game by the scruff of the neck @entity2 and @entity138 embrace after winning the @entity90 in @entity139 against @entity140 @entity2 ’s zealous champions point out , with some justification , that international football is not as prestigious or as important as it was a few decades ago			1
that ignores the fact that most players would still consider winning the @entity112 the pinnacle of their careers			0
but it is true that the club game has risen in influence and players ’ priorities have changed			0
@entity2 is vulnerable in this regard , too , though			1
he has played for @entity34 , the team almost universally regarded as the outstanding side of the last decade and yet , remind me , how many @entity90 titles has he won ? that ’s right			1
the @entity90 is now seen as the ultimate test of a player ’s greatness and @entity2 has only won it twice			1
it is still a fantastic achievement but it seems like an anomaly for someone who is supposed to be the best ever , especially when you consider the achievements of others			0
@entity170 won it five times , @entity173 won it three times , @entity176 won it four times with three different clubs			0
in its incarnation as the @entity90 , other greats like @entity181 and @entity182 won it three times			0
@entity186 and @entity187 , two more players that some old fuddy - duddies think were the best they ever saw , won the @entity90 eight times between them			0
@entity192 's @entity191 ( left ) holds the @entity90 as team - mate @entity187 looks on @entity182 , @entity193 and @entity194 are in jubilant form after @entity197 's 1973 win over @entity198 a fresh - faced @entity173 aped a matador 's passes with a large @entity202 flag following @entity192 's win at @entity204 @entity176 flashes a trademark grin as he celebrates his second @entity90 win with @entity206 @entity208 's side arrive back in @entity206 with @entity170 ( right ) getting his hands on a fifth @entity90 we all have our own ideas of what constitutes beauty in football and @entity2 fits all of mine			1
but if i had to single out the most beautiful thing i have seen in the game , it would be @entity114 ’s fourth goal in the 1970 @entity112 final			1
in particular , it would be @entity107 ’s part in it			1
the way he stops the ball from @entity227 , waits and then strokes it into the path of @entity229			0
it was the stunning simplicity of it			0
it epitomised the way a man who was also a genius was ready to subvert himself to the team ethic			1
@entity107 ’s the best for me but i wo n’t pour scorn on you if you stick with @entity2			1
just remember that in the same way @entity243 football did actually exist before the @entity245 , great players populated our game long before @entity2 walked this earth			1
@entity249 should stop moaning and build a better car when @entity251 won 15 of the 16 races in the 1988 @entity254 season , i do n’t remember @entity255 bleating about how unfair it was			1
i do n’t remember @entity255 demanding instant redress when @entity258 won the first race for @entity251 at @entity260 in @entity114			1
i do n’t remember @entity255 saying that because @entity251 ’s @entity263 engine was so powerful , it should be hobbled in some way			1
i do n’t remember him demanding that the @entity265 do something about it because he had n’t done as good a job as @entity251 had			1
the preponderant @entity251 team celebrate @entity270 's title in 1988 after an utterly dominant season @entity255 was always a bit of a stoic like that			1
he usually worked on the basis that he did n’t get mad , he got even			2
how outdated that kind of attitude seems in the sport now after @entity249 ’s astonishing reaction to @entity281 ’s victory for @entity282 at the @entity284 @entity283 in @entity285 last weekend			2
we have grown used to @entity245 managers throwing their toys out of their prams after a defeat , but what happened in @entity284 really was a spectacular tantrum			0
@entity249 team principal @entity293 is an intelligent man but his suggestion that the @entity282 ’ engine should be ‘ equalised ’ in some way did him few favours			0
and the threat of @entity249 owner @entity299 that he might quit the sport was laughably petulant			0
this is a team , do n’t forget , who exerted their own stranglehold on @entity254 for four years			2
they won 13 of 19 races two seasons ago			0
@entity293 ( left ) and @entity299 were not so stony - faced when @entity249 were won every race now they have discovered they do not have a monopoly on winning , they want to walk away			0
the days of @entity258 and @entity270 sweeping all before them are a distant memory			0
so good luck to @entity282			0
they have done a brilliant job and now they are reaping the rewards			0
good luck to @entity323 , too			0
@entity254 has always been about the battle to get in the best car and after years of watching @entity327 winning in the @entity249 , now it ’s @entity281 ’s turn			2
i ’m with @entity282 boss @entity329 on this one			0
the others should stop moaning and try to get better			0
generally , that ’s supposed to be what sport is about			2
@entity334 is the face of golf now but the sport in the @entity338 still has a little work to do when it comes to name recognition			0
as @entity334 and his group walked up the 18th fairway at the @entity345 on thursday afternoon , the officials put his name up on a board on the far side of the green			0
@entity334 's name wreaked havoc with the scoreboard operators at the @entity345 first , it read ‘ @entity354 ’			2
after a couple of minutes , they realised the mistake			0
there was a hasty rearrangement of letters until it read ‘ @entity361 ’			0
they got it right the third time and the crowd in the stand overlooking the green serenaded them with ironic cheers .			2

yes , @entity2 is a genius . every time i see him play live , it is a privilege
and yes , he was mesmerising against @entity23 at the @entity24
what saddens me about the relentless championing of @entity2 , though , is that the idea there has never been anyone to match him has become such an aggressive orthodoxy
it is as though @entity2 has become a god and the idea that he might have a rival is sacrilege
as a football fan , i worship @entity2 , too , but i do n’t think he ’s the best there ’s ever been . it 's too early for that
