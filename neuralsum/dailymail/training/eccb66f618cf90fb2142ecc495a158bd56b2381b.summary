poachers and bush meat hunters are putting some species of giraffe in danger of extinction and the overall population has dropped by 40 per cent in the last 15 years , conservationists have warned			1
there are now fewer than 80,000 giraffes in @entity10 , 60,000 less than the 140,000 recorded 15 - years ago , according to alarming new research			1
' many of the threats to rhinos and elephants are the same for giraffes , ' dr @entity12 , from the @entity13 told @entity19			1
' the threats are local			0
it 's loss of habitat and increasingly it 's poaching , but not for the international trade , it 's bush meat hunting			0
' the prominence of giraffes in zoos has disguised the fact some giraffes are in danger of extinction			1
there are now fewer than 80,000 giraffes in @entity10 , 60,000 less than the 140,000 recorded 15 - years ago poachers kill giraffes in the wild because they are easy to hunt and provide a lot of meat trapped in a snare , a dead giraffe lies prostrate with its head removed			1
in certain parts of @entity10 the heads and bone marrow from the creatures are prized as a cure for aids she added : ' there 's a difference between poaching for elephants and rhinos for example			1
but with increasing social problems like poverty or the displacement of people , it is becoming more prevalent			0
' ' of course some parts of @entity10 bush meat is part of the staple diet of some , but really this is a bigger issue of food security			1
' poachers also view the giraffe as an easy source of meat , she said , adding that giraffe would be an easy target for the armed gangs hunting for ivory			1
' traditionally they get caught in snares by the poorer local people just looking for food , ' she said			0
' but those hunting higher profile animals have the firearms and automatic weapons which make it simple to kill the noticeable giraffe			2
' their prominence in zoos has disguised the fact that there is very little conservation effort is made with them , she added			0
while giraffe heads and bones can fetch a high price in @entity97 , where some people believe that their bone marrow can cure @entity100 , many are killed for their meat which is both sweet and popular			1
elephant poachers , particularly in the @entity103 , where ivory is traded for ammunition , arms and food , are known to favor the creatures			0
it is then shipped on to @entity110 and @entity111 where despite an international ban , demand for the bone remains high			0
' being delicious is one thing , but there 's also a bucket - load of meat , and they 're not difficult to hunt , ' said dr @entity120 , the world 's only full - time giraffe conservationist			2
' people love giraffes but they 're taken for granted , ' he added			2
' people assume that they 're everywhere			0
they see them on branding and postcards and think they are okay			0
but the decline of their natural habitat has seen their numbers fall dramatically			0
' however , some of the sub-species of giraffe are so rare that they could soon be classified as a species in their own right			1
if this happened , the @entity139 giraffe would instantly become the most endangered large mammal in @entity10			1
the @entity142 estimates that only 300 remain on the whole continent			0
the @entity145 giraffe would also be at risk , according to the @entity147 , the wildlife conservation inventory compiled by the @entity149			2
but despite the dangers a lack of resources prevented a thorough assessment of the entire giraffe population was not even attempted in 2010 the last time they were surveyed , according to dr @entity120 , who is also a director of the @entity142			2
however , along with 14 colleagues dr @entity120 has spent the past year collating the numbers of giraffe and the findings will be presented next year			2
' @entity161 is quite a bit of attention paid to elephants and rhinos but the giraffe is iconic to @entity10 , ' said dr @entity120			1
' but no one has really paid attention to giraffes and they are not really in as good condition as we thought			0
unless something is done soon , we will lose some of these glorious creatures before we even know it			0

there are fewer than 80,000 giraffes in @entity10 according to new research
some prize their heads and bones as a cure for aids
