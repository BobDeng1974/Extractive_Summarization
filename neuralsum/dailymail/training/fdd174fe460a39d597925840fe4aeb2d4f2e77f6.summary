@entity0 was returning from @entity1 to @entity2 when his flight was diverted to @entity4 airport regulations saw former @entity6 and @entity7 striker @entity0 endure his very own travel ' torture ' on tuesday			1
the footballer - turned - horseracing owner was travelling back to the @entity11 from the @entity12 on a @entity14 flight after attending the famous @entity16 meeting			1
scheduled for a fly - in to @entity2 from @entity19 , thick fog meant the flight had to be diverted to @entity4			1
the irony is , @entity0 's original plans were to end up in @entity4 via transfer from @entity2			1
however , once the plan was grounded in the north west , it was n't quite the stroke of luck that the 34 - year - old had hoped for			2
@entity0 took to @entity30 to inform the world of his ' travel torture ' when he wrote : ' @entity33 told i ca n't get off			1
got to wait on plane for over an hour to then fly to @entity2 and miss my flight back up to @entity4			1
' but it was his next , possible tongue - in - cheek tweet that saw him come in for criticism on the social networking site			0
@entity0 added : ' please @entity14 , let me walk off the plane and into my @entity46 car			1
i want to pick my kids up from school and do n't need to go to @entity2 and back			1
' @entity49 replied : ' go through security like the rest of us , ' while @entity53 added : ' sure there 's many other ppl on the plane with same dilemmas # civilianlife			0
' @entity59 weighed in with : ' it 's a security risk , ex footballer or not , ' while @entity62 got personal with his comment of : ' please @entity14 leave him on the plane forever ! ' @entity0 spent three years at @entity65 under sir @entity66 @entity0 ( right ) , @entity67 ( centre ) and @entity69 pose with t - shirts at a @entity72 media event in @entity73 , @entity74 @entity75 added : ' rules are rules , @entity0 , ' which warranted a response from @entity0 when he tweeted back : ' i know and i abide by them 100 %			1
does n't mean i ca n't be annoyed			0
' keeping his 2.99 million followers up to date of how his frustrating day was going , @entity0 later tweeted that he had missed picking his children up , but had managed to squeeze on another flight out of @entity2			1
a spokesman for @entity14 told @entity84 : ' we are very sorry that our customers were inconvenienced by this delay			2
' our flight from @entity19 to @entity2 diverted to @entity4 yesterday morning due to heavy fog at @entity2			1
it refuelled in @entity4 before resuming its journey to @entity2			1
' leaving the diversion airport as quickly as possible is our priority as it causes the least disruption to our customers			2
allowing some customers to disembark and leave the airport would increase the delay to the flight and further inconvenience the majority of customers for whom @entity2 is the final destination			1
' @entity0 ( left of picture ) watches as his horse @entity106 is unsaddled by jockey @entity107 at the @entity16 in @entity108 , @entity12 @entity0 will have been less than pleased after his horse @entity106 finished 11th of 12 in one of the @entity16 's big races it rounded off a frustrating few days for @entity0			2
he took his horse @entity106 over to the @entity12 for the world famous @entity16			0
unfortunately , racing in the $ 3million @entity114 event he only beat one rival to finish 11th of 12			0
@entity0 is no stranger to criticism , having received it by the bucket - load over his style of commentary since joining up with @entity121 as a commentator			2
and now to add fuel to his critics ' fire , his hatred of films , and cringeworthy moaning at ' not being allowed off the plane ' will simply go to show off his personality still further			0
@entity84 reported how @entity0 's role with @entity121 could be under threat after he chose to watch his horse @entity106 run in the @entity16 ’ @entity16 meeting in the @entity134 rather than work on @entity121 ’s @entity137 v @entity7 match last saturday			2
@entity121 are understood to have been disappointed by @entity0 ’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him			2
so much so that if @entity0 misses another game in similar circumstances , there could be a parting of the ways			0
@entity0 won every domestic trophy on offer , but will be best remembered scoring goals for @entity7 but it 's not all doom and gloom for @entity0			0
last month he was inducted into the @entity153 for his services to football			0
@entity0 , who won every domestic honour available during his time with @entity65 and @entity7 as well as the 2001 @entity158 said at the time : ' i am delighted to be selected to join the @entity161			0
what a fantastic way to end my playing career			0
' my whole family are very proud			0
it is great to be joining a list that includes so many of my heroes			0
' the former @entity6 striker tweeted from the event to reveal he was sat at a table ' with legends @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 etc. '			0
