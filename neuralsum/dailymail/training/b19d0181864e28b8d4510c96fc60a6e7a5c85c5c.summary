@entity0 ’s is hitting back against crafty shoppers who buy special occasion merchandise only to return it after a single wear			2
the store is now attaching what they call a ‘ b - tag ’ to dresses in visible spots , like hemlines			1
once removed , a dress will be rendered nonreturnable under new conditions outlined by the national retailer			2
the b - tag , first reported by @entity16 on tuesday , has been attached to all dresses retailing for over $ 150 , a store associate in the chain ’s @entity19 , @entity14 location told @entity21			1
the associate also said that the device is being used at all of @entity25 ’s nationwide outlets			1
hitting back : @entity0 's will now include this b - tag , snapped in - store by @entity21 , on all dresses that retail for more than $ 150 new measures : customers will not be able to return a garment once the bulky b - tag is removed			1
instructions are provided to help shoppers take the tag off of merchandise			2
the store ’s e-commerce business has also picked up on the practice			1
online ‘ details ’ indicate when items will be delivered with a b - tag attached			2
‘ please note that this dress will be delivered with a black b - tag attached , with instructions for removal included			0
if the b - tag is removed , the dress can not be returned , ’ reads an online description for a @entity43 ‘ opal sequin ’ dress			0
the @entity19 store associate told @entity21 that , for now , dresses are the only item at @entity0 's to receive the b - tag			1
@entity16 says that the retailer is ‘ using the tactic to combat a practice known as “ wardrobing ” — buying clothes and using them once — a form of return fraud			0
’ they say that the ‘ @entity64 estimates [ “ wardrobing ” ] cost the industry $ 8.8 billion last year			2
’ internet option : online shoppers will also find b - tags affixed to dresses they purchase from @entity0 @entity21 paid a visit to the dress department of @entity0 ’s @entity19 location in search of the b - tag			1
we quickly discovered the large black plastic tag hanging out from underneath each dress ’s hemline			0
the b - tag is a rudimentary piece of black plastic that resembles many of the store ’s electronic security tags in bulk and size			2
the tag is not , however , electronically charged in any way			0
its teardrop shape and bulbous nature would make it difficult to wear a dress with it still attached			0
in this way , the b - tag tactic will likely prove very effective			0
the b - tag does come with removal instructions , as promised on @entity0 ’s website			0
however when @entity21 attempted to remove a b - tag from the hemline of @entity105 beaded dress , using the instructions provided , the device ’s concept seemed slightly less successful			1
widespread release : @entity0 's is already using the b - tag in all of its nationwide locations ‘ to remove tag , lift “ b ” disk , ’ an instruction card affixed to the dress explained			0
when @entity21 lifted the “ b ” disk , the b - tag ’s tiny puncturing prong did indeed lift away from the dress a bit			1
but it became caught in the cocktailware ’s polyester tulle webbing in the process			0
the garment would have ripped if we had pulled any tighter to release the tag			0
when attempting to return the “ b ” disk to its original spot we discovered that once the disk is lifted , the device ’s seal becomes irreversibly broken			0
had @entity21 purchased the cocktail dress with the b - tag in this form , it would have likely been rejected by store associates			1
a spokesperson for @entity0 's told @entity21 in a statement that the b - tags ' are in place to reinforce the fact that @entity0 ’s will be unable to accept a return of merchandise that has been worn , washed , damaged , used and / or altered			1

the new store policy applies to dresses *priced* at more than $ 150 , a sales associate told @entity21
