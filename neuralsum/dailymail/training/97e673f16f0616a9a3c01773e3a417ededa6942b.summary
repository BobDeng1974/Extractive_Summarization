by @entity0 published : 16:17 est , 6 february 2013 updated : 17:01 est , 6 february 2013 in january , @entity1 announced that it would be opening its doors to the its highly anticipated upcoming @entity4 title @entity3 to fans and gamers through hosting a weekend of closed beta testing			2
@entity8 was one of those who enjoyed some early access @entity3 enjoyment			0
crash and burn : as mentioned in our interview with @entity16 , there are lots of hazards ranging from asteroid strikes to the more bizarre , alien abductions we recently interviewed @entity16 about rebuilding the classic series and now thousands of lucky gamers have had a taste of just how far @entity3 has come			0
players were invited to experience the games tutorial mode and then given free reign with an hour 's maximum gameplay			1
if you enjoyed the beta as much as we did , an hour was n’t nearly enough time			1
@entity3 have been generous with their gameplay videos and screenshots so gamers have known what to expect when they sank their teeth into this city - building monster			1
the tutorial takes you through the basics of gameplay and how to set the foundations for your city including how to manage your power , water , waste and sewage systems – vital attributes if your city is going to flourish			1
the game is powered by the @entity3 engine and is visually beautiful			2
just by using the mouse , players can tilt the camera angle , zoom in and see ‘ @entity58 ’ going about their business and zoom out to admire the growth of the city			1
overlay maps allow players to see better areas to place water towers , areas of high crime or sewage			0
these feedback views are a great way for city - builders to plan and react to the natural growth of their city			1
whilst some aspects of the game were locked in this build , most players will agree that more than enough fun could be had in the hour given			2
plus , the addition of curved roads is a much demanded aspect missing from previous games			0
release is scheduled for march 5			0
@entity82 's @entity81 : follow us on @entity84 : @ @entity85 and on @entity86 : @entity8 .			0
