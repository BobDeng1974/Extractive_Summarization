it was described as one of the most remarkable views any human could hope to see			1
@entity4 , dubbed ‘ the comet of the century ’ , will visit our inner solar system from november to january , with expectations that it could provide spectacular views for the @entity11			1
the eagerly anticipated comet could be 15 times brighter than the moon , with a massive tail , making it visible even in broad daylight			1
but astronomers due to meet this week to discuss observing plans for @entity4 may not have much to talk about			1
‘ the future of comet @entity4 does not look bright , ’ said astronomer @entity30 , with the @entity31 in @entity32			1
initial data suggested that the comet may prove to be brighter than any comet of the last century			1
it may also end up being its one and only trip to the solar system , as its trajectory may see it plunge into the sun in a fiery death			0
in july , the @entity4 was pictured on the opposite side of the @entity45 at around 378 million miles away from @entity46 , travelling at over 50,000 miles per hour @entity30 's calculations , however , show the comet , which is currently moving toward the sun at 16 miles ( 26 km ) per second , has not brightened since mid-january			1
that may be because the comet is already out of ice particles in its body , which melt as the comet moves closer to the sun , creating a long , bright tail			1
another theory is that the comet is covered in a layer of silicate dust that snuffs out water vapour and other gases that brighten the comet			0
‘ @entity4 has been on a standstill for more than 132 days ... a rather puzzling feat , ’ @entity30 said in a paper submitted to the @entity63 and posted online at the archival site @entity65			1
@entity4 is roughly heading towards the centre of our @entity69			2
it will pass within one million miles of the @entity45 's surface on 28th november			0
at the time of discovery in september 2012 , @entity4 was over 584 million miles from the @entity45 images of @entity4 obtained using the @entity75 at @entity76 on february 4 , march 4 , april 3 , and may 4 , 2013 ( left to right , respectively ) the comet , named @entity4 after the @entity78 that made its discovery , was found in september 2012 by two amateur @entity81 astronomers			1
it is due to pass about 724,000 miles ( 1.2 million km ) from the sun on november 28th			0
if it survives , that is			0
at that distance , the comet would reach temperatures of about 4,900 degrees @entity90 ( 2,700 degrees @entity89 ) - hot enough to melt lead			0
it may also be pulled apart by the sun 's gravity			0
following its discovery , @entity4 recalled the excitement of @entity96 , which sailed past the @entity46 in 1997 , appearing as a static - looking smear in the skies across the @entity11			2
scientists believe the comet hails from the @entity101 , a cluster of icy rocks that circle the sun about 50,000 times farther away than @entity46 's orbit			0
@entity96 over @entity107 formations in @entity108 in @entity109			0
following its discovery , @entity4 recalled the excitement of @entity96 , which sailed past the @entity46 in 1997 any object orbiting the @entity45 in a closed loop is given a figure known as ‘ eccentricity ’ of between zero and one			2
if that orbit is in a circular fashion like our own planet ’s , its eccentricity will be close to zero			0
@entity46 ’s eccentricity is around 0.017 which means its orbit is very circular			0
@entity4 ’s eccentricity is 1.000003457 – just ‘ over ’ one			2
this means that its presence in our solar system is an event that has never happened before and may never happen again			0
if comet @entity4 survives the encounter , it could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the comet passes back through the inner solar system			1
spotted in space : two astronomers from @entity81 discovered the icy ball , pictured here dimly lit against background stars @entity4 is roughly heading towards the centre of our @entity69			1
it will pass within 1.2 million miles of the @entity45 ’s surface on 28th november			0
at the time of discovery in september 2012 , @entity4 was over 584 million miles from the @entity145 its average speed throughout july will be 55,405mph			2
it will continue to accelerate steadily until november when it ’ll whip around our @entity45 at an astonishing 425,000mph			0
early data analysis suggests @entity4 ’s size to be around three miles in diameter			2
if @entity4 does n’t fizzle out , you could expect to see the comet with the unaided eye anywhere between the middle of november until the middle of january 2014 .			1

many hope @entity4 will provide remarkable views later this year
it was predicted to have a massive tail and be seen in broad daylight
but now astronomers claim the ' comet of the century ' may have fizzled out
