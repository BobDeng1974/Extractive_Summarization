it 's not every day you reach a milestone birthday , so when you do - you should celebrate in style			1
and @entity4 , @entity6 's giant gorilla , marked her 40th in style by wolfing down a cake made specially for her by the @entity11 runner - up @entity12			1
the fan favourite on this year 's show , @entity12 faced the tough challenge of creating a dessert with all of @entity4 's favourite treats , including sugar - free jelly , apples , carrots and walnuts			1
and he certainly lived up to his ' star baker ' reputation because the 16.5st western lowland gorilla greedily devoured it all			0
he said : ' i 'm thrilled to have made a birthday gift for such a special lady			0
' i 've always loved @entity6 and am a regular visitor so it 's a pleasure to use my bake off skills and help celebrate @entity4 's birthday			1
' i hope she likes the treat i 've created especially for her			0
' he added : ' frankly , if she was on the panel , i might have won the show , to be honest			2
' the cake had several defined layers , which featured walnuts , apples , carrots , red peppers and sugar - free jelly the red peppers were the first to go , said zoo staff , before @entity4 dug into the pink - coloured jelly clearly , using her hands was too much effort so @entity4 digs in using just her mouth instead @entity12 's intricate creation is in a messy state after the birthday girl got to it , with the jelly proving especially enjoyable @entity4 's favourite colour is pink so the colour had be prominent in @entity12 's cake for the birthday girl			1
but he also had the tricky task of making a vegan cake without eggs , sugar , butter or flour to fit @entity4 's dietary requirements			1
he aimed to give @entity4 her daily diet in cake form and include her favourite treats : carrots , apples and walnuts			1
@entity104 to show off his bake off skills , @entity12 made sure the cake had ' clear , defined layers ' - a popular requirement of judges @entity110 and @entity112			1
there is a layer of shredded carrot and parsnip , bound with coconut oil and with brazil nuts hidden inside			0
instead of buttercream , icing is ground cashews coloured with beetroot juice and decorated with pecans			0
there are slices of red pepper in the middle and the top layer is sugar - free vegan jelly with strawberries set within			1
@entity4 was presented with the cake at her birthday party and immediately ran over to indulge in some cake			2
she carefully picked at her favourite bits , with red peppers being among the first to go , before she dug into the jelly topping			0
@entity4 , who likes to forage for food and interact with children who visit her , is the eldest gorilla at @entity6 and has been there for 30 years			2
gorilla keeper @entity143 said : ' @entity4 is our old lady of the group , but is still a girlie girl at heart and loves anything pink , as keepers have noticed from various enrichment activities			0
' she loves pink fruit tea like strawberry or blackcurrant , so @entity12 making her a pink birthday treat was a fantastic surprise			2
she definitely enjoyed tasting all her favourite ingredients			0
' @entity4 has been at @entity6 for 30 years and is a calming influence on the rest of the group			0
she 's been there and seen it all so she deserves a fabulous fortieth			0
' we 're sure having @entity12 on - hand made her birthday a memorable day			2
' nearly gone : with messy fingers , @entity4 enjoys the final bit of jelly before the cake is all gone tucked away in a corner with her treat , she clearly has no plans to share with her friends ' she definitely enjoyed tasting all her favourite ingredients , ' said gorilla keeper @entity143 ' @entity4 is our old lady of the group , but is still a girlie girl at heart and loves anything pink , ' he added			1
