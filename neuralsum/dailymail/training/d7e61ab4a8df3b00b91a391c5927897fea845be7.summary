by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 8 may 2012 updated : 16:04 est , 8 may 2012 a mind - bogglingly big sunspot has appeared in the past few days , which could mean the @entity3 is about to be blasted by powerful solar storms			1
known as @entity6 , it was spotted by @entity9 ’s @entity8 spacecraft , which launched in 2010			0
its diameter of 60,000 miles is many times that of the @entity3 , which measures just under 8,000 miles across			1
the sunspot is so ginormous that it ’s possible to view with home telescopes – though experts warn that these must be fitted with sun filters to prevent permanent eye damage			0
sunspots often travel in pairs and are darker than the surrounding area because they are slightly cooler , which makes them less luminous			0
they are caused by the sun ’s magnetic field becoming twisted – and it ’s this twisting dynamic that can produce coronal mass ejections			1
these contain billions of tons of gases bursting with x-rays and ultraviolet radiation			2
they are mind - bogglingly hot – around @entity54			2
brilliant photo : a solar flare erupting in 2004 and spitting billions of tons of the @entity59 's gas into space the @entity3 is occasionally hit by these ejections , leading to amazing shimmering light shows			1
they are the result of ionised solar particles becoming imprisoned by @entity3 ’s magnetic field , exciting the gases in the atmosphere and emitting bursts of energy in the form of light			1
however , these particles can also cause magnetic storms , which in extreme cases have been known to disrupt satellites and electricity grids			1
in 1989 , a @entity78 was held responsible for leaving six million people in @entity80 , @entity81 , without power			2
solar activity runs in 11 - year cycles , with the current one peaking in 2013 , so more violent space weather is on the horizon			0
dr @entity87 , of the @entity88 in @entity89 , said recently : ' because the sun is becoming more active , it will have an impact on millions of people			0
sunspots can cause the biggest and most damaging space storms that occur			0
' during the next two years , we are expecting the number of sunspots visible on the sun to reach a maximum			0
we know that sunspots are the source of a lot of space weather and solar storms , so we expect a larger number of solar storms here at the @entity3			2

it could result in a gigantic coronal mass ejection , which would blast the @entity3 with radiation and possibly knock - out power lines and disrupt satellites
