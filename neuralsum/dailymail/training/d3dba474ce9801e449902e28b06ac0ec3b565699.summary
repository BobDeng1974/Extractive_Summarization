by @entity0 a driver pulled over when he saw title of @entity4 's song ' @entity6 ' flash up on his dashboard and panicked a worried driver pulled onto the hard shoulder of a motorway after seeing the word ' fire ' flash up on a dashboard display - only to discover it was the title of the song playing on his car stereo			1
the mix - up , caused by the title of the hit song by @entity4 , is one of number of incidents highlighted in a safety campaign to stop people needlessly causing a hazard on @entity28 's roads			1
the @entity29 , which is in charge of the @entity28 's motorways , has revealed some of the most bizarre excuses for pulling over in a bid to remind people that it is illegal to stop on the hard shoulder unless in an emergency			1
on one occasion , traffic officers found two cars on the hard shoulder , with one driver halfway through his vehicle to the other			2
on another occasion , a couple were asked if they had broken down but replied that they were taking pictures of their newborn grandchild in their open - top sports car because it was ' a lovely day '			1
other instances have included : : : a motorist who parked up and fell asleep on the @entity54			2
: : a group of motorcyclists who parked on the hard shoulder on the @entity58 to review their route and have a drink			2
: : a mobile phone user who stopped at regular intervals to carry out signal tests on the hard shoulder			0
the agency said that between july and september 2013 , a total of 2,062 drivers broke the law by stopping on the hard shoulder when there was no emergency			0
. it is also illegal to drive under a red x sign which is displayed when the lane ahead is closed			0
@entity29 national enforcement co-ordinator @entity74 said : ' every day , millions of people use our motorways			1
' most of them use the hard shoulder correctly and do n't ignore red xs , but we are appealing to the few who put themselves , other road users and those working on motorways at risk			1
' where the hard shoulder is used as an additional traffic lane at peak times , you can only drive on it if there is a speed limit over it			0
when a red @entity95 is displayed over any lane , it 's simple - do n't drive on it			0
' drivers are being reminded that stopping on hard shoulders is illegal unless done in an emergency			0
