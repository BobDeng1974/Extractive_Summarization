@entity0 was returning off - duty @entity3 captain @entity2 , his family and 157 other souls from their @entity7 vacation when disaster struck			1
the @entity10 's pilot suffered a devastating heart attack at 30,000 feet on the way from @entity13 to @entity14 , forcing @entity2 to rush to the cockpit and help guide the plane to an emergency landing			1
then the aircraft began to descend and bank steeply to the right			0
' over the public address system ; a flight attendant asked if there was a doctor on board the plane , ' said @entity2 in his first interview since that dramatic flight , given to @entity48			1
' a few more calls went out for medical professionals and the flight attendants were all hurrying to first class with their beverage carts and a first - aid kit			2
' his military training told him to stay seated with his wife and daughter and remain out of the way			0
suddenly , a heart - stopping announcement came over the @entity61 : ' are there any non-revenue pilots on board ? please ring your call button			2
' at that gut - wrenching moment , @entity2 realized the sick person was the pilot			1
according to @entity48 , @entity2 , ' looked to his wife ; as she gave him a nod , @entity2 pressed his button and headed toward the flight desk			1
' walking briskly to the cockpit , @entity2 saw that the pilot was desperately ill. @entity2 immediately knew he was suffering a serious cardiac event			2
drama at 30,000 feet : flight 1637 ( not pictured ) was traveling from @entity13 to @entity14 when the pilot of the @entity10 suffered a heart attack hero : quick - thinking nurse @entity80 , pictured left and right , rushed to respond when the pilot suffered a heart - attack mid-flight ' after they moved the pilot , i was asked by the first officer , ' are you a pilot , ' which was quickly followed with ' what do you fly , ' said @entity2			1
' i knew she was in a serious situation and that question gave her five seconds to judge if i would be useful			0
' i also had about five seconds to asses her , ' was she panicking , or was she ok to fly the aircraft ? ' ' we both finished our silent assessments , she made the right judgment and told me to close the door and have a seat			2
' summoning all his training , @entity2 decided it was best if he adopted a supportive role to the first officer and began to man the radio and troubleshoot any issues as they approached landing			1
' she was calm , but you could tell she was a little stressed , who would n't be , ' said @entity2			0
' at the beginning , i interrupted her flow of operations , but we figured everything out extremely quickly			0
' it was then that the first officer turned to @entity2 and revealed she had never landed at @entity120 airport before			1
however , @entity2 had landed there during his training and talked her through it			1
' i saw nothing but the finest professionalism under pressure out of the flight attendants , the nurses and the first officer , ' said @entity2			2
' everyone aboard the aircraft remained calm , there is no doubt in my mind this contributed above all else to our successful outcome			0
' in my opinion any military pilot would have done the exact same thing i did			0
' room to work : @entity80 and another nurse , @entity143 , pulled the captain out of the cockpit and into the galley , pictured , and after the flight landed safely he was met by paramedics , right , on the tarmac scary : mrs @entity80 was flying home via @entity14 with her husband and 16 - year - old daughter from a @entity7 vacation when the frightening announcements were made the pilot survived and has since thanked @entity2 for his actions			1
he was helped in his survival by quick - thinking nurse @entity80 , from @entity158			0
mrs @entity80 was flying home via @entity14 with her husband and 16 - year - old daughter from a @entity7 vacation			2
when the first announcement was made the registered nurse with decades of experience was first to respond			0
she said she found the pilot slumped over in the cockpit			0
' he was sick and mumbling and was just incoherent , ' she told @entity167			0
the pediatric intensive care nurse , who only recently re-certified her advanced cardiac life support accreditation , noticed his heart was beating irregularly and determined he 'd probably suffered a blood clot or a heart - attack			0
on the rescheduled flight on @entity176 , mrs @entity80 sat next to the co-pilot who informed her the pilot had survived and was being treated in the cardiac unit of an @entity120 hospital .			1
