by @entity0 if you ’ve over-indulged this summer , do n’t despair – because it is possible to be fat and fit			0
doctors say being overweight will not necessarily send people to an early grave because such a thing as ‘ healthy obesity ’ exists			1
in fact , up to one in four of those labelled obese are lucky enough to be fat and fit			0
they are physically fit , have normal blood pressure and process sugar easily , despite their generous proportions			0
celebrities including @entity17 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) have long said that it possible to carry extra weight and still be fit			1
researchers now believe this is true , defining it as ' metabolically healthy obesity ' studies show that ‘ sufferers ’ of healthy obesity have a lower risk of various ills than others who are similarly overweight			1
one 15 - year - long @entity30 study found that the ‘ healthy obese ’ were no more likely to develop heart disease or cancer – or die at any given time – than those of normal weight			1
in other studies , being fat and fit cut the risk of ill health , even if it did not completely remove it			2
the figures come from @entity44 experts who trawled years of research from around the world into the topic			0
their acknowledgement will no doubt be welcome news for the likes of cook @entity17 and singer @entity52 , who have long argued it is possible to be fat and fit			0
writing in a medical journal published by the respected @entity57 group , the medics said accurately identifying those who are fat and fit would cut the bill for obesity treatment			1
@entity52 said she would only lose weight if it affected her health and so far , she said , it has n't gastric bypass and banding operations cost taxpayers up to £ 85million a year , as growing numbers of people become hugely overweight			1
targeting treatment to those who would benefit the most could ensure taxpayers ’ money is best spent			0
the researchers said : ‘ potentially scarce resources can be more effectively tailored … some prevention and treatment strategies can be very expensive and time - consuming			1
’ genes are thought to be key , but working out why some of our bodies resist the toll of excess weight could also lead to treatments to improve the health of the obese who are not fortunate enough to fall into the healthy category			1
doctors normally gauge whether a patient ’s size is a health concern by using their weight and height to calculate their body mass index , or @entity94			1
but relying on @entity94 is controversial , as it does not distinguish between muscle and fat , meaning some athletes are classified as obese			2
the @entity44 researchers said using @entity94 alone was ‘ insufficient ’ and other factors such as waist size , blood pressure and where fat is stored in the body needed to be taken into account			1
but much more research is needed before any formula is ready for use in doctor ’s surgeries			0
and in the meantime , the researchers say that the obese should still think about losing weight			2
the team from the @entity114 and the @entity115 said : ‘ prevention of obesity through healthy diet and physical activity should be widely promoted			2
’ writing in the @entity122 journal , they warned that not everyone who is ‘ healthy obese ’ will stay that way			0
dr @entity125 , a gp and medical director of charity @entity128 , said it made ‘ perfect sense ’ that some people could be fat but healthy			2
but he warned : ‘ the science is not yet precise			0
there is always a risk that you will develop problems later			0

most people - including the medical *community* - *equate* lower weight with better health , but researchers say there is such a thing as ' healthy obesity '
@entity94 is too crude a tool to use when assessing someone *'s* health
they believe concept should be more clearly defined so that overweight people at a **higher** risk of disease can get the treatment they need
but added that overweight people should *attempt* to lose weight as they are still at **higher** risk of disease in the long - term
