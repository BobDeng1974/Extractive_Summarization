dirty facilities on holiday is the main reason behind why @entity3 write negative holiday reviews - yet one in four of us fail to mention it while at the resort			1
accommodation that was ' not as advertised ' and ' poor location ' are other key reasons that lead us to take to review sites in anger			1
the survey by @entity16 also revealed that whilst 37 per cent of @entity3 who had a good experience on holiday left a positive review , 69 per cent of those who had a bad experience left a negative review			1
a quarter of @entity3 who are n't satisfied with their room say they do n't bother to complain at the time the survey set out to reveal the reasons why @entity3 leave bad reviews after going on holiday and discover whether people are more likely to leave good or bad reviews			1
a total of 2,172 @entity3 citizens completed the survey , all of whom were aged 18 or over and had been on at least one holiday ( either in the @entity3 or abroad ) within the last 12 months			1
there was an even ratio of male and female respondents			0
initially , respondents were asked ' have you ever had a good holiday ? ' , to which 87 per cent stated that they had			0
finding out your hotel was ' not what was advertised ' leads many to leave a negative review on a website when asked if they had subsequently left a positive review after a good holiday , 37 per cent stated that they had			1
by comparison , of the 43 per cent of respondents who stated they had experienced a ' bad holiday ' , more than two thirds had left a negative review , suggesting that reviews are more likely to be left after a negative experience than a positive one			2
all respondents who had left a negative review were asked where they had posted their review , with the option to select as many options as they wanted			2
three quarters said they left the review with the ' booking agents / websites , ' followed by 68 per cent who used ' social media ' and 56 per cent who posted comments on an ' independent travel advice site '			0
some hotel nightmares include this toilet that is missing its seat and an extremely dirty bathtub these respondents were then asked if they had tried to address the problem ( s ) whilst on holiday by making a complaint , to which 26 per cent stated that they had not taken any measures to raise the issues during their holiday and potentially improve the circumstance during the time			0
source : @entity16 @entity86 of @entity16 said : ' it 's really important to raise your concerns if you can and give the holiday provider a chance to put it right , if you have the opportunity			0
' they might be able to change your accommodation or even upgrade you in order to make sure you have a good time			2
' most providers , from accommodation to catering , do n't want you to have a rubbish time â€“ and they definitely wo n't want you to leave a bad review			1
' it 's interesting to see the top reasons why people complain			0
they are all really good reasons , in all fairness , and they are things that can ruin a holiday			0
' we would strongly advise that holidaymakers do their research before booking anything ; check out the reviews that are already there before believing glossy pages or slick websites			0

accommodation not being what was advertised is also a major gripe
bad experiences *increase* the *likelihood* of a holidaymaker writing a review
@entity3 urged to *voice* their *grievances* at the time and not after
