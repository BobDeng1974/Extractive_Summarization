the sad absence of prince @entity1 from the final glorious tableaux marking the @entity3 meant the @entity4 had the opportunity to decide with whom to share the affection of the public on that last open carriage ride through the streets of @entity11 to @entity12			1
she chose the former mrs @entity13 , now the @entity14			1
the two women sat side by side , their comfortable level of intimacy plain to see			0
prince @entity19 sat on the seat facing them			0
how true the old axiom that time changes everything			0
this year it was announced that @entity13 is to become a @entity37 to mark the seventh anniversary of her wedding to @entity19 some 14 years ago , just 12 months after that crash in @entity41 in which princess @entity42 was killed , @entity19 went to see his mother			1
he was looking for approval and support for his relationship with mrs @entity13			2
since @entity42 ’s death , his relationship with her had continued to be conducted in the shadows			1
he wanted to be able to go out openly with @entity13 , to be seen with her , to take her to the theatre and out to dinner with friends			1
the @entity19 knew the @entity4 ’s approval would help , and that the first step was to get her to soften her attitude towards his long - time mistress			2
it was not a happy meeting			0
as a highly placed royal confidante told us then : ‘ @entity4 told her son she never wanted to talk about that wicked woman , and wanted nothing to do with her			1
’ @entity4 arrives at the @entity66 to @entity12			2
her husband , prince @entity1 , has been watching the events unfold on the television @entity70 : @entity13 , once derided by @entity42 as ' that other woman ' , has been slowly winning the hearts of the public after years on the sidelines the @entity76 carriage procession passes through as thousands of excited fans wait to greet her - and @entity78 of @entity79 patriotic : the @entity4 's carriage procession passes through the capital in front of adoring crowds @entity19 was devastated			1
he could n’t understand why his mother had taken so bitterly against the woman he loved			0
nor could he see that his request to the @entity4 so soon after @entity42 ’s death was premature			1
these were the days , of course , when memories of princess @entity42 , accompanied by considerable public anger at the way she was treated , were still fresh in the nation ’s mind			2
today , the only mention of the tragic @entity42 came four days before the jubilee weekend from prince @entity98 , in a touching tv interview recorded not here but in the @entity101 , where affection for — and understanding of — @entity42 remains high			2
here , the woman @entity42 described as the ‘ third person ’ in her marriage has not merely been accepted into the @entity107			1
she has clearly turned into its most central figure after the @entity4 herself , a vital and trusted lynchpin between the young and the old			2
during the four - day jubilee weekend , @entity13 has never been without a word : here , to the @entity113 ; there , to the @entity4 ; an amusing aside with prince @entity1 ; a giggle with the young princes			1
throughout the spectacle , she has been the most animated and relaxed figure in the @entity107 , plugged in to them all			0
the truth is that she has become — as we first saw as the @entity121 grouped with the @entity4 on board the spirit of @entity124 on the @entity125 on sunday — an integral element of the so - called ‘ @entity127 ’			2
@entity13 pictured in the distance during the @entity130 pop party at @entity12 in 2002 all change : @entity13 took her place on the front row of the @entity134 as she watched the @entity135 last night showing just how far she 's come in 10 years time heels : the @entity4 shares a word and a smile with her daughter - in - law at the jubilee concert on monday night			1
the @entity14 was a notable fixture over the jubilee weekend these core @entity144 family figures , in addition to the @entity4 and prince @entity1 , are @entity19 , @entity13 , @entity98 , @entity113 and @entity146			1
so there was @entity13 in the spotlight while prince @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 — who has always been frosty towards her elder brother ’s wife — were consigned to the margins on other boats			0
the reason ? a new palace policy of a ‘ slimmer ’ family focusing on the monarchs and her direct heirs			0
@entity146 , too , will probably disappear from this core group the moment @entity98 and @entity113 have a baby and the child is old enough to take his or her place in public			0
yesterday , not one of these ‘ relegated ’ royals was even allowed on the @entity12 balcony with the @entity4 when she excitedly took in the @entity171 @entity170 fly - past salute followed by the @entity173			1
yet a smiling @entity13 was there with the other principal royals			0
how very different from the @entity4 ’s @entity130 a decade ago , when @entity42 had been dead a mere five years and @entity13 was a peripheral presence , shepherded carefully out of the spotlight			1
prince @entity19 on his wedding day to @entity42 , @entity179 , and right , in 2005 , after he married the @entity13 at @entity180 part of the clan : @entity13 stands close to her husband @entity19 as the senior royals admire the cheering crowd the @entity186 and @entity113 wave as they travel along @entity188 , through @entity189 and along @entity190 was lined by more than 1,000 servicemen on that occasion , when there was a concert in the gardens of @entity12 , and @entity19 went on stage to give his thanks and pay tribute to his mother , @entity98 and @entity146 were with him , but there was no sign of @entity13			1
this time , on monday night after the concert watched by tens of thousands round the @entity204 and down the @entity190 , when the @entity19 again paid a warm tribute to ‘ mummy ’ , the @entity14 was not only on stage with him , but standing alongside the @entity4			1
for @entity42 ’s friends and millions of supporters , @entity13 ’s comfortable prominence is bound still to be painful			1
what has to be said about the @entity14 , however , is that since marrying the @entity19 in a civil ceremony at @entity180 in april 2005 , she has made a spirited effort to win over her detractors and has worked hard embedding herself as the wife of the heir to the throne			0
@entity19 ’s relaxed and jolly manner during the past few days can also be ascribed to @entity13 ’s influence			0
the raw humour and blue jokes that first attracted him to her at the start of their epic love affair 40 years ago still make him ‘ giggle ’			0
home and dry : the carriage , built in 1902 , was made by @entity228 for @entity230 's coronation			0
it is pictured here arriving at @entity12 home sweet home : the @entity4 's carriage pulls up outside the palace - luckily the rain that had been threatening held off following the carriage procession through @entity188 , the @entity4 and senior royals will gather on @entity12 's balcony to watch a flypast of @entity241 aircraft and the @entity173 his confidence and widely praised speech after monday night ’s concert is not unconnected to her perceived growing popularity with the people , even though many will never forgive her for her role in @entity42 ’s tragedy			1
‘ no one should underestimate how proud the @entity19 is of her , ’ says a friend			0
‘ he sees @entity13 as a misunderstood woman who has stuck to her guns			2
this weekend he has derived great comfort and pleasure from the fact people have been applauding @entity13			0
it ’s what he ’s always wanted			0
’ the intervening years , however , have been difficult for the @entity4 , who has had to tread a delicate path between public animosity towards the woman @entity42 described as the ‘ rottweiler ’ and her son ’s refusal to give up the woman he loved			1
under the circumstances , the @entity4 really did n’t have much choice , because the heir to the throne could hardly go on living indefinitely with a woman who was not his wife			2
when they married seven years ago , the @entity4 clearly made up her mind to give them her support , hence her amusing speech at that @entity180 wedding breakfast in which the horse - racing enthusiast @entity4 welcomed the newlyweds ‘ into the winners ’ enclosure ’			0
@entity286 good fun ! the crowd comes down @entity190 to see the @entity4 appear on the balcony of @entity12 a people on the move : thousands of members of the public are let in to watch the balcony appearance of the royal family a huge wave of @entity3 fans make their way up @entity190 to catch a glimpse of the @entity4 as she makes her way to the balcony of @entity12 even the @entity4 could not have recognised the prescience of her words			0
since then , having earlier lost the wise and close counsel of the @entity304 and her sister @entity305 , it is no surprise to long - serving courtiers that the mature and shrewd @entity13 has turned herself into someone to whom the @entity4 feels she can talk			1
indeed , this has made @entity13 the ultimate bridge — between @entity19 and his mother			0
whichever way you look at it , hers has certainly been a remarkable transformation from scarlet woman to royal @entity14			2
and ultimately — who would seriously question it ? — to be @entity4 one day .			0

after @entity42 's death in 1997 , @entity4 referred to @entity13 as ' that wicked woman ' and ' wanted nothing to do with her '
yesterday , her majesty chooses @entity14 of @entity79 to share open carriage ride through the streets of @entity11
