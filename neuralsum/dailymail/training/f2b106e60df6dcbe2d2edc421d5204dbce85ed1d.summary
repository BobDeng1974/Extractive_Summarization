the 41 - page report was compiled by a team from the @entity23 at @entity24 ( @entity25 )			1
thirty agents were assigned to perform such tasks as washing the children 's clothes , driving them to offsite showers , and making them sandwiches			2
the @entity44 was even directly involved in efforts to care for immigrant children in early 2012 when it helped negotiate a temporary shelter at @entity49 in @entity50			0
yet the @entity1 administration considered the problem a ‘ local ’ one			1
protesters gather outside the @entity8 consulate in @entity54 , @entity37 , on friday : agencies like the @entity11 and @entity12 were ' ringing alarm bells ' about the federal government 's capacity to manage the situation , according to a report presented to the @entity16 in march ‘ there were warning signs , operational folks raising red flags to high levels in terms of this being a potential issue , ’ an anonymous former senior federal law enforcement official told the @entity62			1
@entity1 ’s domestic policy adviser , @entity70 , has denied that the administration was slow to react and said the current crisis is ' off - the - charts different			1
' ' it was not the same pattern , ' she said			0
' we assumed a significant increase , but this was not the same kind of trend line			0
' the @entity33 has since revised their original estimate of 60,000 children for the year to 90,000 illegally entering the country by the end of september			0
last month , @entity1 ordered an emergency response overseen by the @entity86 and the @entity87 , and asked @entity88 to approve $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds			1
the @entity25 report also claims that warnings came from outside the federal government as well			1
the first ladies of @entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 cited ' worrisome statistics ' showing an upswing in unaccompanied minors in april 2012			0
the same month , @entity37 gov. @entity100 wrote a letter informing the president that the number of unaccompanied @entity6 minors crossing the border was up 90 percent from the previous year			2
he criticized the @entity1 administration for ' perpetuating the problem ' by its inaction			1
' every day of delay risks more lives , ' wrote @entity100			0
' every child allowed to remain encourages hundreds more to attempt the journey			0
' a group of immigrants from @entity95 and @entity115 who crossed the @entity9 - @entity96 border illegally are stopped in @entity118 , @entity37 during the president 's 2012 reelection campaign he announced plans to defer the deportations of certain immigrants brought to the country illegally as children before june 2007			1
critics now argue that the administration chose to ignore reports about the growing number of immigrant children and instead focused on trying to push his reform bill through @entity88			2
' was the @entity44 told there were huge flows of @entity6 coming ? of course they were told			0
a lot of times , ' one former government official told the @entity62			2
' was there a general lack of interest and a focus on the legislation ? yes , that ’s where the focus was			0
' the flood of children crossing the @entity8 border illegally and without their parents has slowed down in recent weeks , two senior @entity1 administration officials said on friday			1
@entity33 agents in the @entity154 in @entity37 have found fewer than 500 children crossing the border illegally this week , the officials said			2
last month , agents arrested as many as 2,000 child immigrants a week			0
the @entity1 administration has been struggling to deal with a flood of more than 57,000 children traveling alone since oct. 1			1
homeland security secretary @entity162 said earlier this month that as many as 90,000 unaccompanied child immigrants could be apprehended by the end of the budget year in september			0
most of the children are from @entity95 , @entity115 and @entity94			0
@entity94 president @entity168 , @entity95 president @entity169 and @entity24 @entity115 president @entity170 will meet with @entity1 and vice president @entity171 on july 25			1
demonstrators hold signs and flags outside the @entity175 in @entity176 : the @entity1 administration has been struggling to deal with a flood of more than 57,000 children traveling alone since oct. 1 @entity171 has been the point person for contacts with these @entity6 leaders			1
he last spoke to them by phone on july 9 and was in @entity94 for meetings on june 20			0
the @entity9 has been urging those governments to take steps to stem the exodus of children and warning that the @entity9 will take steps to send them back promptly			0
the volume of child immigrants has significantly taxed resources at the @entity16 and @entity194 departments in recent months and prompted president @entity1 to ask @entity88 to approve an emergency $ 3.7 billion spending bill to deal with the situation he has called an " urgent humanitarian crisis			1
" the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the latest trends in border arrests , said friday it 's too soon to know what has led to drop in border arrests			2
they said illegal border crossings along the @entity8 border tend to slow during the summer			2
prospects for action on the @entity9 - @entity96 border crisis faded on thursday as lawmakers traded accusations rather than solutions , raising chances that @entity88 will go into its summer recess without doing anything about the tens of thousands of migrant children streaming into @entity37 @entity11 has launched a public relations campaign to warn would - be immigrants and their families in @entity6 that the trip to the @entity9 border is dangerous and immigrant children will face deportation after they are apprehended			1
but since the trip through @entity96 can take weeks or even months , recent border crossers are unlikely to have seen much of the campaign			0
along with dealing with the flood of children traveling alone , the @entity33 has also arrested more than 55,000 people traveling as families , mostly mothers with young children			0
because of a lack of detention space many of those people have been released with a notice to report back to immigration authorities at a later date			2
the @entity1 administration has repeatedly declined to say how many people have been released and how many have reported as ordered			1
in recent weeks the @entity16 has opened a family detention center with space for as many as 700 people center in @entity244 , @entity96 , at the @entity33 's training facility			1
@entity12 announced friday that a detention center in @entity247 , @entity37 , would be converted to house families starting in the next few weeks			0
that facility currently has space for 600 people .			0
