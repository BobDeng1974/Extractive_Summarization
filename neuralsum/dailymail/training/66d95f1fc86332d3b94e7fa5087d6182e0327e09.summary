@entity0 has been made @entity2 's featured player for january in their official 2015 calendar – saving them any embarrassment if he does n't stay at @entity6 for the rest of the year			1
the release of the club 's official calendar could provide important clues into how @entity2 see the squad developing in the next 12 months			1
each month is accompanied by a large picture of a particular player and nobody wants @entity2 fans to turn over to a new month later in the year to see a player no longer with them			1
@entity18 , who is out of contract at the end of the season and has n't decided whether he wants to stay , is featured as the main picture for march when he certainly will still be with his hometown club			1
@entity0 ( left ) takes over january on @entity2 's 2015 calendar while @entity18 is given march under pressure goalkeeper @entity25 ( left ) is in february as @entity26 is given september midfielder @entity27 ( left ) takes his place in july and @entity29 will represent this time next year @entity31 january - @entity0 februrary – @entity25 march – @entity18 april – @entity32 may – @entity33 june – @entity34 july – @entity27 here to stay august – @entity36 september – @entity26 october – @entity37 november – @entity38 december – @entity29 but , significantly , @entity37 is held back until october			1
the 20 - year - old has been linked to other clubs including @entity41 following a blistering start to the season but he is tied down to a long - term contract at @entity6 and his position in the calendar suggests the club will play hardball over his future in the summer and keep him , as they did when @entity51 bid for @entity52 in 2013			2
@entity0 , 24 , has endured a torrid time on @entity54 since a much - hyped £ 16million move from @entity56 in august			0
he has yet to score a @entity58 goal for his new club and is currently facing @entity61 charges in connection with a social media post that allegedly contained racist and anti-semitic content , something the player strongly denies			0
given the paucity of striking resources at @entity2 , manager @entity67 is prepared to give the @entity71 another chance when he returns from a groin injury and re-evaluate his future in the summer			0
but the reality is if @entity2 unexpectedly receive an offer in january that allows them to recoup their outlay , they would listen carefully			2
@entity38 ( left ) and @entity76 are the stars chosen to represent november and june defenders @entity33 ( left ) and @entity36 have both struggled for form this season @entity37 ( left ) takes his place in october as @entity32 is featured on the april page with @entity52 gone , @entity67 has only had @entity29 and @entity83 available up front because of injuries to @entity26 and @entity83			2
@entity87 ace @entity86 is on loan to @entity89 and due to return for next season			0
@entity2 , @entity58 runners - up last season , are currently in ninth position and need to beat @entity94 on tuesday night to stay in the @entity95			0
the recent malaise at @entity6 is underlined by the fact that three of the six players on the cover of the calendar – @entity18 , @entity27 and @entity37 – are in contract talks , @entity0 's woes are well - documented and @entity26 has hardly played this season because of injury			1
the sixth player featured is @entity34 .			0

*captain* @entity18 is the featured star for march next year
in demand winger @entity37 is saved until october
