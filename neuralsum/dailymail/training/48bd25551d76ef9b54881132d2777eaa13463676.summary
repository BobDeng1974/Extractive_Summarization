by @entity1 reporter published : 12:07 est , 12 march 2012 updated : 12:08 est , 12 march 2012 around 13 per cent of women and five per cent of men have some degree of urinary incontinence			2
women are particularly affected after childbirth women who face the daily embarrassment of not quite reaching the ladies in time could find relief ... with @entity13			1
injecting the the toxin directly into the wall of the organ was found to improve symptoms among women considered to have a “ weak ” bladder			1
on average , the number of times they suffered an episode of incontinence fell from six times a day to under once a day			0
the number of times they felt an urgent need to go to the toilet also fell , from around eight times a day to three times a day			2
about four out of 10 women treated with the powerful neurotoxin became continent again after six weeks and a third were still continent six months after treatment			1
the effects started to wear off after about six months			0
the study , published in the journal @entity39 , was carried out at eight urogynaecology centres in the @entity41 from 2006 to 2009			0
a total of 240 women were split into two groups , with 122 women given @entity13 and 118 receiving a dummy treatment			1
researchers found improvements across a range of symptoms , including wetting oneself , feeling a need to rush to the toilet , and how often the women ' leaked ' urine			1
however , there were side - effects - including some women needing to use a catheter to go to the toilet because of paralysis in the bladder muscle			1
it is unclear how many people in the @entity41 suffer urinary incontinence , but it is thought to affect more than 50 million people in the developed world			0
figures from a previous @entity41 study found that 13 per cent of women and five per cent of men had some degree of urinary incontinence			2
women are more at risk , owing in part to the effects of childbirth			2
current treatments include pelvic floor exercises , behavioural therapy and drugs that can have side - effects , such as a dry mouth , constipation and blurred vision			0
dr @entity87 , senior lecturer from the @entity88 and honorary consultant gynaecologist at @entity90 , led the latest study			0
he said some patients affected by the condition ' find it hard to cope ' , adding : ' one patient told me of a harrowing situation whereby she ended up passing water over a supermarket floor			0
' he continued : ' we found that a single treatment with botulinum toxin was a very effective treatment for the symptoms ; patients were able to pass water one or two times less often during the day , and also noticed far fewer times when they had bad feelings of urgency and had to rush to the bathroom			0
' in patients treated with botulinum toxin , incontinence episodes dropped from six a day to less than once a day			2
' the number of urgency episodes fell from eight a day to three a day at six weeks			2
these changes were maintained at a similar level for up to six months			0
' the treatment is not without complications ; about one in eight women had some difficulty emptying their bladder at some time in the six months after treatment ( due to paralysis of the bladder muscle )			1
' this was treated by teaching the women to use disposable catheters , but the effect does wear off after about six months on average			1
' @entity13 is not approved for the treatment of an overactive bladder in the @entity41 and currently only used in trials dr @entity87 said he was ' excited ' by the results of the trial , saying @entity13 ' works so much better than the drugs we have			1
' he continued : ' my patients have been delighted with how well it works , even with the chance of needing to use a catheter			2
' i ’m delighted to say that botulinum toxin has much better results than a six - month course of tablets or bladder training			0
' our work may lead to @entity13 being licensed to treat overactive bladder syndrome in the @entity41			1
' the study was funded by the @entity155 , @entity156 and the @entity157 , and is the largest of its kind into @entity13 not to be funded by drug firms			1
@entity162 , director of @entity156 , said : ' this is a horrible condition and often means otherwise healthy active women curtail their lives , becoming prisoners in their homes			0
' it is rarely discussed but affects many women			0
' @entity13 is currently not approved for the treatment of an overactive bladder in the @entity41 , according to the @entity172 ( @entity172 )			1
it is licensed in some @entity174 countries and @entity178 for patients whose incontinence results from conditions such as spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis ( @entity183 ) .			0

nearly half of women treated with @entity13 became continent again after six weeks
but one in eight needed a catheter to go to the toilet after suffering paralysis in the bladder muscle
