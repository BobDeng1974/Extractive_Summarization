by @entity0 , @entity1 editor published : 18:05 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 18:50 est , 26 may 2013 charities have demanded urgent action to prevent access to illegal and ‘ disgusting ’ child pornography via @entity6 and other web browsers			1
a coalition of organisations is arguing for the introduction of blocking software and on - screen warnings to deny internet users access to the material			1
the group includes the @entity16 , @entity17 ’s , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , and stop it now			1
a coalition of charities has demanded urgent action from the likes of @entity6 to prevent access to child pornography their call follows revelations in the @entity32 on saturday about the ease of finding video and photos of the sexual exploitation of young girls			1
the investigation by mail columnist @entity39 was prompted by the case of @entity41 , killer of 12 - year - old @entity41 , whose murderous fantasies were fuelled by online child pornography			1
but the group , the @entity46 @entity45 on internet safety , questioned if firms like @entity6 have the will to take action			1
@entity52 , government adviser on internet safety and secretary of the charity coalition , said the @entity32 was right to highlight the problem			0
‘ @entity6 can do more and should do more , ’ he said			0
‘ for example , whenever someone puts in a search that clearly indicates they are looking for child pornographic material , @entity6 could flash up a warning			2
‘ it could say “ you are trying to reach child pornographic material			2
this is illegal and if you persist there is a chance of arrest and prosecution ”			0
’ @entity6 ’s web browser has three levels of filtering – ‘ unfiltered ’ , ‘ moderate ’ and ‘ safe ’			0
the murderous fantasies of @entity41 killer of @entity41 , 12 , were fuelled by online child pornography the default is moderate , which does not block hardcore porn			1
‘ it would be very easy for @entity6 and others to have “ safe search ” as the default , ’ mr @entity52 said			0
it is illegal to search for child pornography and anyone who finds suspect images is advised to report them to the @entity87 so they can be blocked			1
miss @entity39 ’s article revealed how easy it is to find images of what appeared to be child sexual exploitation			1
all of the details have been passed to the @entity95			0
mr @entity52 said : ‘ this is a major public policy challenge			0
@entity39 is dead right in saying there needs to be some sort of control on @entity6 ’s searches			2
’ last night @entity6 said : ‘ we take this issue extremely seriously			2
we are members and joint funders of the @entity87			0
when we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it we respond quickly to remove and report it			0
