but a piece of reverse graffiti in @entity8 has become a popular local attraction after a talented artist designed a beautiful oak tree that only appears when it rains			1
unlike usual graffiti , which is washed away by heavy downpours , @entity13 ' reverse graffiti only becomes visible when touched by water and disappears again when it dries			2
popular graffiti : @entity18 born artist @entity13 has created a reverse graffiti image of an oak tree in @entity8 that can only be seen when it rains first step : @entity13 pictured drawing the the outline for the stencil of an oak tree @entity26 project : @entity13 then created a stencil of the @entity29 - @entity8 's official tree - to the correct size the @entity18 born artist has been creating reverse graffiti since 2009 when he experimented with using waterproofing treatments on bricks to create the artworks			1
the artwork , which on located on the side of a former synagogue in downtown @entity39 and commissioned by the @entity40 , @entity41 and the @entity42 of @entity39 , is of the state 's official tree - a @entity29			1
mr @entity13 , who is in his mid fifties , said : ' it 's a conceptual mural which is built on a brick wall and the basic idea is a giant image of an oak tree			1
' i noticed that when water is applied to untreated concrete it changes colour			0
big structure : @entity13 , pictured left , then stuck the stencil to the side of a former synagogue in downtown @entity39 piece by piece : @entity13 cut the stencils into small square and then put them back together on the wall time consuming : @entity13 then had to painstakingly cut out the markings on each stencil ' i wanted the tree to appear with the rain , staying there throughout the rain and then slowly disappearing when the wall dries up			2
' that little element of magic is what were after and that 's what good art is about , its about surprising the viewer			0
' mr @entity13 recalls using this technique as a child , spraying water on the pavements to make basic pictures and patterns			0
to create the piece , mr @entity13 drew the giant picture on hundreds of small square stencils before spending three days creating graphite transfers of every section			2
technical : @entity13 then strayed the completed stencil with a waterproofing formula @entity93 : when the stencil was removed , the wall was sprayed with water to reveal the image of the charter oak tree end result : the detailed image of a charter oak tree appears as the wall is sprayed with water it then took another two days sticking the stencils to the wall before a final three days cutting the stencil to the final picture before spraying the wall with waterproofing formula			1
' it 's a wonderful feeling , i love getting dirty when working on art. i had two other artists helping me on this and it 's nice that we 're all speaking the same language			0
' the beauty of this project is that this has n't been a compromise of my artistic integrity , if anything my original smallish idea has blossomed into realisation ' this has been an amazing opportunity for me and i 'm really grateful to everyone who has helped me with this project			0
' piece of magic : @entity13 wanted to create a piece of artwork that would surprise the viewer local attraction : the wall is sprayed with water several times a day so members of the public can see it finishing touches : it took five days in total to stencil the wall and spray it with formula job well done : @entity13 , pictured in front of his latest artwork , has been creating reverse graffiti since 2009			1
