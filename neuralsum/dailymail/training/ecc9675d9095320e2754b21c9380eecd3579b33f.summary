by @entity0 published : 10:33 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 14:51 est , 22 july 2013 motorists have won a landmark judgement after the @entity3 ruled it illegal for a cash - strapped council to hike parking charges as a revenue - raising stealth ‘ tax ’ to subsidise its other services			1
motoring groups said the ruling was ‘ fantastic news ’ which had major implications for millions of drivers because it would stop local authorities across the country ‘ picking on drivers ’ to fill their empty coffers by imposing similar illegal parking ‘ taxes ’			2
a high court judge ruled @entity22 council in north @entity23 acted unlawfully when it increased the cost of residents ' parking permits and visitor vouchers in controlled parking zones ( @entity29 ) to raise revenue			1
objectors complained that the increases had made parking in @entity22 's quiet residential streets ' more expensive than parking outside @entity35 ' and were ‘ picking the pockets ’ of residents '			1
fight : @entity22 resident @entity38 led the legal action against the council 's unfair parking charges they argued that around 10 per cent of @entity22 residents , who lived in @entity29 , were heavily subsidising transport services for the whole borough and that the parking hikes were designed by the council to fund expenditure on road maintenance , subsised concessionary fares and other road transport costs			1
mrs @entity52 agreed , declaring at @entity23 's @entity3 that the 1984 @entity61 ‘ is not a fiscal measure and does not authorise the authority to use its powers to charge local residents for parking in order to raise surplus revenue for other transport purposes ’			1
the judge ruled that @entity22 had misinterpreted the law when it concluded that it was lawful for the council ' to budget for a surplus ( of parking charges ) at any level which it considered appropriate in order to generate income for other transport purposes which it wished to fund			1
' residents in the borough had originally faced residential parking charges of £ 20 for a first car and 35p each for visitor vouchers			1
those charges were increased in 2006 to £ 40 and £ 1			0
but in 2011 they soared to £ 100 and £ 4 - among the highest controlled parking zone charges in @entity23			2
the ruling is believed by experts to be the first successful legal challenge against the level of parking charges set by a local authority			1
it could see thousands of @entity22 residents reclaim millions of pounds in unlawfully collected charges			1
campaign : @entity90 led the fight against the council more significantly it could lead to many more legal challenges and prevent similar actions			0
professor @entity96 is director of the @entity97 which had given evidence backing the residents			0
he said : ‘ our position has now been vindicated			0
‘ this is fantastic news for drivers			0
the law is explicit - parking charges are about managing congestion , not raising revenue			1
' if there is a surplus collected then there are strict rules on what it can be used for			0
why did @entity22 ever think it had an arguable case to pick on one group of residents to shoulder an additional tax ? ’			2
’ professor @entity96 said he had some sympathy with cash - strapped councils , but added : ’ but we have no sympathy for attempts to make up the shortfall by arbitrarily picking on drivers			0
that view has now been backed by the courts			0
‘ councils thinking of turning to motorists to balance the books would do well to read the judgement and put their heads back below the parapet			0
this ruling will be felt by hundreds of local authorities and benefit millions of drivers			0
’ the ruling was achieved by the @entity90 , made up of residents from the borough , including solicitor @entity38 , who brought the lead case			2
mr @entity38 , from @entity140 , won the quashing of the council 's decision in february 2011 to dramatically increase the charges with effect from april 2011			2
the judge rejected arguments put forward by council lawyers that it had powers under section 45 of the @entity152 to raise a surplus from parking charges for transport functions			1
there were no parking charges in mr @entity38 's quiet residential road until the @entity159 was first introduced in 2001 to prevent tube commuters parking in local streets			1
the judge ordered the council to repay the parking charges unlawfully obtained from mr @entity38 , plus his legal costs , opening the way for other residents to seek their money back			1
the judge formally rejected @entity22 's application to appeal against her ruling , but the council can still ask the @entity172 to hear the case			2
mrs @entity52 said her orders against @entity22 would be stayed until the appeal court makes a decision			2
unfair : the cash - strapped council put the cost of permits up by up to 300 per cent to raise money for other projects mr @entity38 , a 46 - year - old father of two , said after his victory : ‘ @entity183 has been caught picking the pockets of residents			1
they were being made to contribute disproportionately to a range of services such as road repairs and the provision of bus passes across the borough			0
' simply holding a summer bbq or a children 's party could cost £ 40 in parking charges			1
an elderly person enjoying regular visits from a relative could face an annual cost of £ 800			0
‘ today 's judgment confirms that @entity200 never intended local authorities to take a large cut every time a book club meets , mums get together for coffee or a washing machine is repaired			0
’ it was regrettable that @entity22 spent more than two years , and tens of thousands of pounds defending actions ‘ which they should have known were legally and morally wrong , ’ he said			0
mr @entity38 's solicitor , @entity211 , a partner at @entity23 law firm @entity212 , said his client stood to gain just £ 120 rebate and was not motivated by money : ‘ he was motivated by this being a matter of principle and his concern for all the people who could clearly not afford this astronomical hike in fees			0
’ he added : ' it is a tribute to @entity38 's commitment and tenacity that he was not prepared to give up as he encountered many bureaucratic or legal obstacles along the way			0
this ruling now clearly proves that @entity183 , rather than funding parking through its fees , as the government intended when it passed the law , was raising money for illegitimate and unlawful purposes			2
’ @entity22 council leader , @entity235 , conceded that the increase in charges had been carried out ‘ too abruptly and rather charmlessly ’ , but said there would be an appeal			2
targeted : residents who lived in the controlled parking zones around @entity22 @entity242 had to pay the ' stealth tax ' to the council @entity245 , @entity246 , said : ‘ this government has been very clear that parking charges are not , and should not be , a town hall stealth tax on local residents			1
we have scrapped the @entity247 's guidance which pressured councils to hike up parking charges			1
indeed , making sure that car parking charges are reasonable is an important way in which councils can help support their local high streets and local shops			1
’ some councils have also been criticised for appearing to use cash raised from on - street parking and fines to subsidise other services			0
any which are found to be doing so may also face legal challenges on similar grounds			0
the @entity97 noted : ‘ no on - street charges can be levied to raise revenue ‘ the power to make charges for parking is defined by law to be for “ relieving or preventing congestion of traffic ”			2
‘ there are also more general powers to manage parking for safety and amenity but these do not also permit charging			0
’ it said : ‘ the law is quite clear that local authorities may only impose charges for controlling congestion			0
they have no power to impose charges in order to raise money for any other purpose			1
’ currently @entity22 residents can buy two types of visitor vouchers for friends or tradespeople needing to park near their homes			1
a book of 12 ‘ half - day ’ vouchers , which last up to four hours , and costs £ 26.40 – averaging £ 2.20 each or a book of 12 all - day vouchers which costs £ 49.92 , averaging £ 4.16 each .			0

@entity22 residents ' parking permits soared up to 300 per cent in cost
now they have won ruling saying it is illegal for councils to use parking charges to raise money for other transport projects
