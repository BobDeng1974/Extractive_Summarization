by @entity0 published : 13:49 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 07:15 est , 4 march 2014 each morning residents of the east @entity4 state of @entity5 watch the sun rise more than 90 minutes earlier than the west of the country			2
this is because time on the clocks across @entity4 are set to be exactly the same in each of its states and provinces , regardless of location			2
the result is a huge discrepancy between the time shown on the clock and where the sun is in the sky – a problem that this map reveals is widespread throughout the world			1
click on the the image to enlarge it ... this map shows the difference between clock time and ' solar time '			1
the ' late ' places are shown in red , the ' early ' places in green			2
the deeper the shade , the more out of sync time is the map , created by @entity37 engineer @entity36 , highlights the huge differences between solar time and clock - time in large parts of our planet			1
mr @entity36 said that the map was inspired by a trip to @entity45 , whose time zone means that @entity48 's sunset is more than an hour later than that of @entity49			2
this is because of the latitude and @entity53 ’s tilt as it moves around the sun causing solar daysto vary throughout the year			1
‘ the modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year , ’ explains mr @entity36 , in his blog			2
large parts of the @entity61 and @entity62 have a discrepancy of around an hour between solar time and clock time mr @entity36 said that the map was inspired by a trip to @entity45 , whose time zone means that @entity48 's sunset is more than an hour later than that of @entity49 a solar day is the length of time between the sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times			1
the length of a solar day varies throughout the year , and the accumulated effect of these variations produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes			0
this is because of @entity53 's tilt and its elliptical orbit as it moves around the sun. the @entity53 moves fastest when it is closest to the sun and slowest when it is furthest away			2
this ' unequal motion ' causes variations in the length of the solar day and in the times of sunrise and sunset			0
for example , midday in @entity49 goes from 11:47 in early november to 12:17 in early february			0
the map reveals that the sun rises and sets later in the day than it should in a larger part of the world , with the late places shown in red and the early places in green			1
most of @entity103 is heavily red , but mostly in zones with very scarce population			0
the exception is @entity107 , with a discrepancy of two hours			0
‘ it seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical , ’ notes mr @entity36			0
‘ but in the pre-industrial - revolution world travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance			0
’ the change from solar time , where all days have different lengths , to solar meantime , where midday wanders around 12:00 , came about due to the increase in mechanical clocks in the 19th century			1
the development of rapid railway systems and the consequent confusion of schedules that used scores of different local times led to the introduction of time zones as we know them			0
‘ indeed , if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved , the natural result is the current time zone system , ’ said mr @entity36			0
the sun rises earlier in some parts of western @entity137 as shown by the green in this map			1
this is because the length of a solar day varies throughout the year , and the accumulated effect of these variations produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes this might go some way to explain why people in @entity45 tend to stay up later			0
the country ’s time zone puts it an hour ahead of the @entity151 despite being on the same longitude ‘ the immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part , ’ said mr @entity36			1
‘ normally , these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction , but human geography sometime forces greater differences			0
’ politics also comes into play for some of the discrepancies seen in the map			0
for instance , in @entity168 all the clocks are set to @entity170 time			1
this means in the western part of the country , marked in deep red on the map , solar noon takes place at three in the afternoon			1
in @entity180 province , the @entity178 minority makes a point of observing its own time and not that of local @entity184			0
politics also comes into play for some of the discrepancies seen in the map			0
for instance , in @entity168 all the clocks are set to @entity170 time			1
this means in the western part of the country , marked in deep red on the map , solar noon takes place at three in the afternoon			1

@entity194 , by @entity36 , highlights the difference between solar time and clock - time in large parts of the planet
places where the sun rises later according to solar time are shown in red and areas earlier are shown in green
this is due to latitude of country and @entity53 ’s tilt as it moves around sun causing solar days to vary during the year
for example , all clocks in @entity168 are set to @entity170 time which means in western part of the country solar noon takes place at three in the afternoon
