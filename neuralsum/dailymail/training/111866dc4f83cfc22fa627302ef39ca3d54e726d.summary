miss @entity25 , who was due to start an @entity56 degree at university a month later , cradled her boyfriend ’s head in her lap and begged his laughing attackers to leave him alone after they battered him unconscious			1
attack : @entity1 was in a fit of rage when he attacked a nurse and broke their nose at @entity23 psychiatric unit but instead the group , ' acting like a pack of wild animals ' , ignored her pleas			1

judge @entity134 said : ' another patient behaved badly and had to be restrained and put in the seclusion room immediately adjacent to your room			0
because the staff did not like the patients gathering round when someone has to be restrained you were asked not to approach your room			0
' although you complied with it when a member of staff came to speak you rebuked him for the way he looked at you and started to verbally abuse him and make repeated threats to kill him			2
you were left on your own to calm down			0
' matters went from bad to worse and other members of staff become involved to try and persuade you to move from where you were standing			0
there was no alternative but to physically restrain you as a last resort and with great reluctance			0
life sentence : @entity1 ' accomplice @entity8 , pictured at 16 , was also jailed for life ' staff continue to try and persuade you to do what they wanted you to do , to withdraw threats made , but without success			1
for a good half hour staff members were exclusively involved in trying to persuade you to cooperate			0
' it was utterly clear you had not the slightest intention of cooperating			0
staff were prevented of making their quarter hourly checks on other patients to ensure their wellbeing			0
' they exhausted every possibility and an arrowhead formation was formed			0
@entity20 approached you with raised hands in a gesture made to reassure you			2
you knew what was going to happen , you had given your understanding to this handling			0
' they behaved entirely properly and in accordance with methods but all to no avail			0
@entity20 advanced and you struck a single blow , a very substantial blow that fractured his nose			2
it was a painful and unpleasant injury but could not be said to be serious in the context of a really serious injury			0
” ' the violence used against @entity20 was unlawful violence and the court has a clear public duty as well as to other patients who may think that they have little to lose by behaving badly			2
' staff who care for you are often at some risk themselves of being attacked			2
it is important for you to understand they exercise the very greatest patience and restraint and are wholly conscious of difficulties you suffer from but you can not be permitted to use unlawful violence against them and expect that to have no consequences			0
