an telescope monitoring the moon has captured the moment a 40kg rock slammed into the lunar surface creating a bright flash of light			2
the explosion on march 17 was the biggest seen since @entity8 began watching the moon for meteoroid impacts about eight years ago			1
so far , more than 300 strikes have been recorded			2
' it exploded in a flash nearly 10 times as bright as anything we 've ever seen before , ' @entity12 , with @entity8 's @entity13 at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , said in a statement			1
the flash was so bright that anyone looking at the moon at the moment of impact could have seen it without a telescope , @entity8 said			1
after reviewing digital recordings made by one of the program 's telescopes , scientists determined the space rock was about 1ft ( 0.3 meters ) in diameter , and traveling about 56,000 mph when it slammed into the moon and exploded with the force of five tons of @entity50			2
that same night , cameras detected an unusually high number of meteors blasting through @entity55 's atmosphere as well			0
most meteors burn up well before reaching the ground			0
@entity8 's lunar monitoring program has captured hundreds of meteoroid impacts on the moon			1
the brightest was detected on march 17 which is marked with a red square but not always			1
in february , an asteroid estimated to be about 66ft ( 20 meters ) in diameter exploded over @entity65 , @entity66 , damaging buildings and shattering glass , leaving more than 1,500 injured			0
it was the largest object to strike @entity55 since 1908			0
' the @entity66 fireball was many orders of magnitude larger and possessed 100,000 times more energy , ' than the lunar impact , @entity12 said			0
he believes the lunar impact and the march 17 meteor shower on @entity55 are related , the result of both bodies traveling together through a region of space sprinkled with small rocks and dust			1
' we 'll be keeping an eye out for signs of a repeat performance next year when the earth - moon system passes through the same region of space , ' @entity12 said .			0

explosion happened on march 17 and was the biggest seen by @entity8
a @entity8 satellite is now on a hunt for the newly formed crater
