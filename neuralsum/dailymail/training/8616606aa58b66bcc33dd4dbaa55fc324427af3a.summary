back in july , @entity0 tweeted a photo of training at @entity3			1
there were cones meticulously laid out , a pristine grass pitch and footballs at the ready			2
just one thing was missing : players			0
it seemed like a caustic comment on the state of affairs he had inherited at the club			0
at that time £ 170million worth of talent was being sold ; no one had come in			1
it did n’t bode terribly well			0
‘ i did n’t mean it that way ! ’ insists the @entity3 manager , now linked with @entity19 and facing his one - time mentor and former friend @entity21 at @entity22			1
‘ it was not a message that we do n’t have players			0
other people took that decision to say that			0
if it was a joke , i would be the first to say it was a joke but it was n’t			0
’ @entity0 has exceeded expectations after arriving as @entity3 manager @entity0 will face his former friend and mentor @entity21 at @entity36 on sunday while it is undoubtedly true that all around sensed chaos and crisis at @entity3 , he had sufficient self - belief to convince onlookers that the club could have a good season , though he does have the good grace to admit he is surprised to be in a @entity46 spot with more than half the season gone ‘ no , i did n’t expect this , ’ he concedes			1
‘ in that time , players were a little bit afraid about the situation but that ’s normal			1
because if you are like @entity55 , you are the captain of the team and you see four , five or six players out of the dressing room , signing for other clubs , of course you have reasons to be afraid			0
‘ my job was to calm that and to talk to the players and to give them the confidence that when we start the season , we will have a good team to continue what they did last season			0
’ @entity70 was one of several high profile players to leave @entity72 's in a £ 170m exodus @entity3 currently sit fourth in the @entity75 table following victory against @entity77 their progress since then has been stunning			1
only @entity80 and @entity81 had scored more goals prior to this weekend ’s games and they have the best defensive record , with just 15 goals conceded			0
@entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 would all crave a record like that			0
in the circumstances perhaps it ’s no surprise that @entity0 gives short shrift to those managers who say they need time to adapt to new circumstances			1
‘ it ’s an easy answer as a manager to say , “ i need time ”			2
you do n’t have time in football			2
i think sometimes they are more excuses of the people than to expect something			2
’ ( @entity107 ) @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 train ahead of the visit of @entity3 mangers like @entity21 who need more time are just making excuses , according to @entity0 easy to say , of course , when you win 11 of your first 14 games in the @entity75 ; not so easy for @entity86 , who won three of his first 11 and has spent much of the first half of the season saying that it will take time for players to adapt to his ideas			1
‘ maybe he is different to other managers but i do n’t believe in football that you need two years or one year			2
it ’s all about qualities of the players			0
and the better the players , the easier it is for the manager			0
’ once friends , @entity0 and @entity86 fell out while working at @entity133 together			1
now @entity0 hopes to upset the older man again by guiding his saints into the @entity46			1
he says : ‘ games like @entity22 are good tests to see if the players believe in the qualities of the team and if we can reach that kind of position in the table			1

@entity3 travel to @entity22 for a @entity75 clash
@entity0 has exceeded expectations since arriving as @entity3 boss
@entity150 says managers that say they need more time are just making excuses
