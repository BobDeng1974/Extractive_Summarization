@entity0 is home to the most deprived estate in the country , with four out of five children growing up in poverty			1
but such hardship did not stop residents of the @entity9 former mill town from gambling £ 72million on high stakes betting machines last year , chasing jackpots of up to £ 500			1
the total , the equivalent of £ 340 for every man , woman and child in the town , will fuel the claim that casino - style fixed odd betting terminals ( @entity22 ) , described as the ‘ crack cocaine ’ of gambling , risk causing serious addiction among the poor			1
frightening : the people of @entity0 , one of @entity31 's most deprived areas , gambled £ 72million on fixed odds betting terminals in the last year , which are as addictive as crack cocaine a bookmaker became hooked on slot machines after playing them ' for fun ' at work – and ended up stealing £ 20,000 from her bosses			1
@entity41 began playing the machines at the @entity44 shop where she worked using her staff card , before progressing to using her own money			2
soon she was embezzling from the shop by cashing in fake winning slips			0
at trial , @entity49 , 27 , received three years ’ probation and was ordered to get counselling and do 225 hours of community service			0
another case of someone who has become hooked on the machines is a father who wishes to remain anonymous to protect his family			2
@entity59 , a married father of three , aged 51 and hooked on playing electronic roulette in high street betting shops			2
he bet £ 1,000 some weeks and has gambled £ 90,000 to £ 100,000 away			1
he lost his own business , almost lost his wife , and although he has found a job in advertising he is struggling to keep his £ 400,000 house in @entity68 , @entity69			2
‘ i have always enjoyed a gamble on the horses , but my problems started when those machines came into the high street			2
once you get started , you ca n’t imagine the buzz and adrenaline			0
@entity59 joined @entity78 18 months ago and says he has now controlled his gambling			0
in @entity0 the economy has been hit so hard by the recession that even @entity82 ’s has left the centre			0
the town ’s @entity85 estate has 72 per cent unemployed and 59 per cent with no employable skills			1
the housing estate was named the most deprived area in @entity90 for a fifth consecutive year this month			1
more than 200 children on the estate are growing up in poverty , with around 800 people claiming council tax or housing benefits			1
people living in @entity85 are not expected to live beyond the age of 69 - while those living just two miles away in @entity100 and @entity101 can expected to live for 10 years longer			1
the council 's own statistics show @entity104 also has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country , with one in 10 girls giving birth under the age of 18			0
yet there are 69 of the machines spread across 19 betting shops in the town			1
they allow players to gamble as much as £ 100 a time in games such as virtual roulette			1
coun @entity119 , chairman of the council 's health and overview committee , said : ' i have said for a long time that we have become a nation of gamblers			0
' you find that every programme on tv is asking you to ring this number for a chance to win something			0
' that is where it starts and people get hooked on gambling			0
i am against there being too many of these machines in one area but you have to be able to give people the choice			2
' but some of these people who are making the choice to gamble on these machines can not afford it			2
' bookmakers deny targeting vulnerable communities , saying the claim is ‘ false and offensive ’			1
but in the poorest areas of the @entity31 more than £ 5.6billion was staked on 4,454 fixed odds betting machines last year			1
unacceptable : three quarters of the @entity85 estate are on benefits in a town that councillors fear is addicted to gambling decline : four out of five children on the estate are growing up in poverty , according to @entity165 data in @entity166 , which has the fourth highest rate of child poverty in the country , more than £ 197million was staked on 189 machines in 52 betting shops			1
last night the constituency ’s @entity173 mp , @entity172 , urged the government to review the laws surrounding the machines			1
she said : ‘ it ’s a sad fact that poorer people use these machines more than others			2
it ’s a very disturbing and worrying trend			0
’ @entity183 of the campaign for @entity185 , which collated the figures , said : ‘ the high stakes and speed of play have led to the machines being called “ the crack cocaine of gambling ”			2
' ‘ you see people on the machines for hours on end			2
no matter how big the win or the loss they keep coming back for more			0
’ last year @entity200 ’s dispatches found @entity201 netted an estimated £ 416million a year from @entity22 , while @entity202 made around £ 359million , @entity203 £ 290million and @entity204 £ 41million			1
the @entity205 is urging the industry to make @entity22 less profitable by reducing the maximum stake to £ 2			0
@entity209 mp @entity208 wants a change in planning laws to stop the proliferation of betting shops			0
she said : ‘ i would go further and suggest that all betting shops should be on the first floor and not on ground level			0
’ earlier this month sports minister @entity217 ruled out taking immediate action against the fixed odds machines			1
mr @entity217 insisted the government was ‘ seriously concerned about problem gambling ’ , but told the @entity222 there was a lack of evidence that the terminals were a major problem			0
almost £ 195million was staked on 131 machines in deprived @entity230 and @entity231 constituency in @entity69			1
in another deprived constituency , @entity232 , @entity69 , £ 243million of bets were placed on 164 high - stakes machines			1
@entity236 £ 243,270,300 * 2			0
@entity238 and @entity239 £ 227,000,000 4			1
@entity230 and @entity231 £ 194,616,240 7			0
@entity242 and @entity243 £ 189,210,233 9			0
vauxhall £ 178,398,220 * by parliamentary constituency ( in millions ) @entity22 were introduced in @entity31 betting shops in 2001 under the previous @entity165 , after the then chancellor , @entity247 , abolished duty on individual bets in favour of a tax on bookmakers ’ gross profits			1
ever since many @entity254 have campaigned for it to be reversed			0
had there not been a change in law , bookmakers would not have installed @entity259 as the tiny profit margin they make per stake would have been wiped out by the duty			0
experts say @entity259 have stopped thousands of bookmakers from going out of business			0
gambling industry figures show that each @entity267 machine earns a betting shop just under £ 1,000 per week			1
as bookies across the country have on average four machines – the maximum allowed – fobts are earning a bookmaker about £ 4,000 per week before tax and deductions			1
the @entity205 is calling for the industry to make the machines less profitable by reducing the maximum stake to £ 2			2
betting shops are classified as financial services , meaning that if a bank or similar business closes , a betting shop can open in the property unchallenged			0
@entity183 , campaign for @entity185 consultant said : ' the high stakes and speed of play have led to the machines being called " the crack cocaine of gambling " , and the @entity295 limits each betting shop to four @entity259 - so bookies leapfrog regulations by opening up as many shops as possible , which is why we get clustering , especially in poorer areas as our research has shown			1
' critics : campaigners say that high streets in more deprived areas , like this one in @entity308 , south east @entity69 , are being filled with betting shops to target the poor a spokesman for the @entity312 said betting shops are heavily regulated and socially responsible businesses			1
they added : ' according to independent planning reports they add to the vibrancy and vitality of the @entity31 's high streets			2
' the industry employs 45,000 people and supports a further 60,000 jobs in the economy			0
' our members pay £ 1 billion in taxes , far more than any other comparable retail businesses			0
' gamblers @entity78 can give help and support to people with gambling problems , for more information visit www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk following the publication of this article , @entity335 has asked us to point out that @entity338 are not addictive , according to their own research			0
they say only 3.5 per cent of gambling adults play on @entity22 ; the number of problem gamblers playing on them is 8 % and this figure is declining and that 70 % of machine players play only about once a month .			0
