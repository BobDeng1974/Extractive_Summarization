one saturday evening a few years ago , a football manager confided his thoughts on @entity2 to a small group of journalists			1
he deplored his behaviour , his disciplinary record and his general air of brooding malevolence			2
somebody made the tentative suggestion that @entity2 might have one or two good points			1
the manager thought for a moment			1
‘ maybe , ’ he said			2
‘ but he keeps them bloody well hidden			2
’ at the time , it was an image which @entity2 did little to dispel			1
for him , it appeared , football was a violent game in a violent world			2
you played , you fought , you prevailed			2
and if you could inflict a little damage along the way , then so much the better			2
the fact that he was a wonderful player , one of the finest of his generation , only enhanced his aura			2
some suspected the aggressive persona was something of an artifice ; the cropped head , the jutting jaw , the intimidating stare			1
there was more than a whiff of calculation about the way he carried himself , but so daunting was the effect that few were prepared to question his credentials			2
if it really was an act , then @entity2 was a hell of an actor			1
in truth , the question has not been settled by his latest autobiography , @entity29			1
@entity2 is at pains to reassure us that he really was the monster of myth and legend			1
his violent clashes are regurgitated in lingering detail			2
the notorious assault on @entity72 is not only exhumed but opens the book : ‘ i wanted to hurt him and stand over him and go , “ @entity75 , you c * * * ”			1
i do n’t regret that			2
’ he describes a fight with @entity80 in a @entity82 hotel : ‘ @entity80 had grabbed me , i ’d head - butted him			2
’ he relates in detail an altercation with @entity87 ’s assistant manager @entity86 : ‘ i ’m surprised i did n’t knock him out			1
’ @entity2 's notorious assault on @entity72 ( ground ) in 2001 opens the book			1
‘ i wanted to hurt him , ' he says @entity2 , through writer @entity93 , recalls a fight in which he heatbutted team - mate @entity80 ( left ) for those who subscribe to the popular perception of @entity2 , the first half of this book will reinforce every prejudice			1
but then he becomes a manager			1
everything changes , and his book captures those changes quite brilliantly			1
we become aware that @entity2 possesses a rare capacity for self - analysis			1
on the face of it , he is the epitome of gruff indifference : ‘ this is me			2
if you do n’t like me , tough ! ’ in fact , he worries about his tendency to self - destruct , he articulates the difference between anger and rage , and he reveals an insecurity we scarcely expected in so assertive a character			1
and he gathers together all the strands of this infinitely complex personality , and goes off to manage @entity123			1
his confidences are occasionally beguiling : ‘ i ’d never had an office before			2
now i had a secretary			2
i had a phone ; a phone with buttons and different lines			0
i had a leather chair that swung around , a swivel chair			0
for the first few days i used to swing around on it			0
if any of the players or staff had peeped through the office window they would have seen me going , “ @entity138 ! ” ’ he did n’t put up pictures of his family , since he did n’t want to make the place too comfortable : ‘ i thought : “ if things go badly , i want to be able to clear it out pretty quickly			0
’ @entity2 holds a copy of @entity29 in which he reveals another side to his personality in passing , he supplies a delightful deflation of the risible @entity151			1
@entity2 has the vague thought that @entity151 might give @entity123 a lift			1
‘ so i got @entity151 ’s number and rang him up			0
it went to his voicemail : “ hi , it ’s @entity151 — whazzup ! ” — like the @entity157 ad			0
i never called him back			0
i thought : “ i ca n’t be f * * * * * * signing that ”			0
’ he picks up on the small things , like the pre-match choice of music			0
‘ the last song that was played before the players went out on to the pitch was dancing queen by @entity173			0
what really worried me was that none of the players , nobody , said : “ get that s * * * off ” … we lost 3 - 1			0
i do n’t think it was down to @entity184 , but after the match i criticised the players … they were going out to play a match , men versus men ; testosterone levels were high			0
you ’ve got to hit people at pace			0
f * * * * * * dancing queen			0
i would n’t have minded if it had been one of @entity173 ’s faster ones			0
’ slowly , certainly , he grows to love the club			0
he becomes utterly engaged in the complexities of the job ; not merely the tactics and performances , but the human relationships , the anticipation of crises , the way the staff would come to him with marital difficulties or problems with their children			0
@entity2 applauds on the bench in @entity202 in his capacity as @entity204 assistant manager @entity2 ( centre ) gives a wry smile ahead @entity209 's 7 - 0 defeat of @entity210 in @entity212 qualifying ‘ i think that was one of my strengths , ’ he says			1
‘ i think i had a kindness to me			0
but there was never a day when i ’d go into work and come out in the same mood ; there ’d always be something going on			0
’ he starts to enjoy it , the setbacks and the successes			0
he takes @entity123 from the foot of the @entity226 to the title in his first season			1
he preserves their @entity230 place in his second			0
he revels in the victories and tells a harrowing tale of his reaction to a 7 - 1 beating at @entity235 : ‘ i hardly left the bed for 48 hours			0
i do n’t think i even showered for two or three days			0
’ in the third year of a three - year contract , after some hard words with the new owner , he takes his leave			1
some six months later , he joined @entity242			0
it was the wrong club at the wrong time			0
again , he is fiercely honest : ‘ i do n’t think i ’m a bad manager , but at @entity242 i managed badly			1
’ @entity2 enjoys his step into management at @entity123 , the setbacks and the successes even as a boss though his fiery , passionate side came out - here he argues with referee @entity252 after his player @entity253 is sent off in 2007 after success at @entity123 , @entity2 gives an honest appraisal of his next job at @entity242 : ' i managed badly ' we sense that he almost welcomed the parting			1
but it was to @entity123 that he gave the best of himself , where he discovered what the job entails , and he tells his story with startling clarity and almost painful candour			1
it is light years beyond the usual pap of managerial memoirs : ‘ toe - to - toe with @entity272 … wild nights with @entity274 … my @entity275 to play @entity276			1
’ @entity2 ’s book , ghost - written by @entity93 , is an endlessly absorbing piece of work			1
it may well be the finest , most incisive deconstruction of football management that the game has ever produced			0
in short , it is something of a masterpiece			2
@entity2 ’s good points are hidden no longer			1
@entity287 the people who conduct post-match interviews for @entity290 are rarely mistaken for @entity291			0
but last weekend ’s cross-examination of @entity293 and @entity294 , following @entity296 ’s victory over @entity297 , touched brave new levels of obsequiousness			0
‘ guys , ’ began the interrogator , ‘ after that brilliant win against @entity302 , was that a decent way to back it up ? ’ as the great @entity305 used to say : ‘ there ’s no answer to that			0

@entity2 did little to dispel his *perceived* malevolent persona
in the first half of his book , @entity29 , he reinforces every prejudice
but then the former @entity87 hard man becomes a manager at @entity123 *...* and everything changes
this book is light years beyond the usual pap of managerial memoirs
it is something of a masterpiece and finally reveals his good points
