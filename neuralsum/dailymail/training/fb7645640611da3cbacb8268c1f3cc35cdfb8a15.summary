by @entity0 published : 13:00 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 14:25 est , 28 january 2013 what could be the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of @entity6 's ancient civilisations has been discovered			2
archaeologists working at the site near to @entity9 have so far unearthed 150 skulls with just one or two vertaebrae attached - suggesting they were hacked off the victims			1
dated to between 600 and @entity13 , the skulls were found in an area miles from the nearest large city of the day , and researchers say the discovery could challenge existing notions about the area 's ancient culture			1
an ancient skull found near to @entity9 : researchers have found what could be the the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of @entity6 's ancient civilisations			1
this skull is from an earlier find ' it 's absolutely remarkable to think about this little nothing on the landscape having potentially evidence of the largest mass human sacrifice in ancient @entity29 , ' said @entity30 of @entity31			1
he is co-author a study detailing the findings published this month in the journal @entity35			0
dr @entity30 , an archaeologist at @entity38 's anthropology department , and colleagues stumbled across the site while using @entity41 to investigate ancient waterworks surrounding the ancient kingdom of @entity44			1
that mysterious city , home to the famous @entity47 , flourished from 200 to 650ad but , to date , the civilisation that built it remains unknown			0
it was in the now - drained @entity50 , which was at the time surrounded by nothing more than rural farmland , that dr @entity30 discovered a site which showed evidence of looting , @entity49 reported			2
closer investigation revealed the skulls , as well as a shrine with water - deity statues , incense burners and agricultural pottery like corncob depictions , which researchers said suggested a ritual purpose tied to farming			2
dr @entity30 told @entity49 that carbon dating of the skulls suggested they were at least 1,100 years old			2
the find is similar , but much earlier than , the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath @entity9 reported in october last year			1
archaeologists excavating the ancient @entity77 city of @entity78 , on the site of the modern - day @entity6 capital , found the 500 - year - old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city 's @entity84 but while the provenance of that burial site was quickly ascertained , there is no clue as to how assembled the @entity50 cache of skulls			1
bloody history : the find is similar , but much earlier than , the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath @entity9 reported in october last year			1
this picture is from that discovery the team chose not to release photos of these latest skulls because the sacrificial victims may be historically tied to indigenous people still living in the area			2
@entity102 , an archaeologist with @entity103 in @entity104 who was not part of the research team said that the findings could lead to a revision of historical accounts of the region			0
the site is not associated with @entity44 or other regional powers , she told @entity49 , and its location is unlike the great pyramids within cities where such sacrifices usually took place			0
she also suggested that the shrine and the fact that most of the victims were male suggest they were carefully chosen and not simply the result of indiscriminate slaughter of locals			0
many researchers believe the kingdom of @entity44 fell as a result of a disastrous drought , and there followed a period of warfare as smaller regional powers competed for supremacy			0
dr @entity102 suggested the political instability could have spurred merciless innovation in the region 's bloody sacrifice rituals			0
' maybe they needed to intensify their activities because everything was changing , ' she told @entity49			0
' when things are uncertain you try new strategies			0

find could challenge the *conventional* account of @entity29 - @entity148 history
the 1,100 year old skulls found in an area miles historical cities
archaeologists stumble across them while surveying on @entity41
