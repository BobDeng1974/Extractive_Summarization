by @entity0 the lineage of huge meat - eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years			1
this is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants , mapping their unlikely transformation			0
the tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs , which gave rise to modern birds , were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller			1
the lineage of huge meat - eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years			2
this is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants , mapping their unlikely transformation @entity22 , meaning ‘ beast - footed ’ , were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs - @entity25 , velociraptor and @entity28			1
' these bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations , such as feathers , wishbones and wings , four times faster than other dinosaurs , ' said co-author @entity36 , a palaeontologist at the @entity37			1
' birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs , ' added lead author associate professor @entity42 , from the @entity43			1
' being smaller and lighter in the land of giants , with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations , provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities , such as the ability to climb trees , glide and fly			2
the study , which ' weighed ' hundreds of dinosaurs , suggests that shrinking may have helped the group that became birds continue exploiting new ecological niches			1
this evolutionary tree shows major events in dinosaur body size evolution the branch of theropod dinosaurs , which gave rise to modern birds , were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller			1

being smaller and lighter in the land of giants , with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations , provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities the first birds evolved after the feathers of a group of dinosaurs received a burst of colour , a recent study shows			1
research has found that , as well as giving birds their appearance , the pigment chemicals in feathers readied their dinosaur ancestors for flight			1
these same chemicals may have helped change the metabolism of early birds so they could stay in the air during flight			0
the study focused on small , meat - eating maniraptorans , which lived 150 million years ago and had many early vestiges of birds			0
scientists compared the hair , skin , fuzz and feathers of living land vertebrates including birds , mammals and reptiles with fossil specimens of ancient lizards , turtles , dinosaurs and pterosaurs			2
they were surprised to discover maniraptorans and living mammals and birds shared the evolutionary development of variety in the shapes and sizes of melanosomes - chemicals that provide the colour in tissues , hairs and feathers			2
‘ ultimately , this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins			2
' researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree			0
they used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches			0
the study found that the dinosaurs most closely related to birds are all small , and many of them - such as the aptly named @entity74 - had some ability to climb and glide			1
it concluded the branch of dinosaurs leading to birds was more evolutionary innovative than other dinosaur lineages			1
' birds out - shrank and out - evolved their dinosaurian ancestors , surviving where their larger , less evolvable relatives could not , ' said professor @entity42			2
the research follows a separate study which also concluded that shrinking may have helped the group that became birds continue exploiting new ecological niches			1
an international team , led by scientists at @entity166 and the @entity167 estimated the body mass of 426 dinosaur species based on the thickness of their leg bones			0
the team found that dinosaurs showed rapid rates of body size evolution shortly after they appeared around 220 million years ago			0
however , these soon slowed and only the evolutionary line leading to birds continued to change size at this rates			0
this continued to happen for 170 million years , producing new ecological diversity not seen in other dinosaurs			0

on the right , a broad - billed hummingbird ( @entity190 ) in front of a tooth of a massive dinosaurian predecessor ( the 6 - tonne @entity193 ) @entity194 , the first bird , was a small dinosaur weighing only 2.2lbs ( 1kg )			0
small size might have been key to the evolutionary success of birds			0
this line kept experimenting with different , often radically smaller , body sizes - enabling new body ' designs ' and adaptations to arise more rapidly ‘ what we found was striking , ’ said dr @entity205 at the @entity167			0
‘ dinosaur body size evolved very rapidly in early forms , likely associated with the invasion of new ecological niches			1
in general , rates slowed down as these lineages continued to diversify			0
‘ but it ’s the sustained high rates of evolution in the feathered maniraptoran ( a theropod ) dinosaur lineage that led to birds – the second great evolutionary radiation of dinosaurs			1
’ this evolutionary line kept experimenting with different , often radically smaller , body sizes - enabling new body ‘ designs ’ and adaptations to arise more rapidly than among larger dinosaurs			2
other dinosaur groups failed to do this , got locked into narrow ecological niches , and ultimately became extinct			1
@entity25 weighed 7 tonnes and was the largest land predator of all time			0
dinosaur groups that failed to change in size got locked into narrow ecological niches , and ultimately went extinct dinosaurs evolved into a huge range of shapes and sizes over 170 million years			1
small body size might have been key to maintaining evolutionary potential in birds , which broke the lower body size limit of around 2.2lb ( 1kg ) seen in other dinosaurs			2

@entity22 , ancestors of birds , were only dinosaurs that got smaller
they evolved feathers and wings four times faster than other dinosaurs
they were more evolutionary innovative than other dinosaur lineages
separate study found shrinking may have helped the group that became birds continue exploiting new ecological niches
