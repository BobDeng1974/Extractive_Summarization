@entity3 , already dreaming about winning the masters , was already an extremely talented golfer in 2009 and he casually informs the family that he 's the no. 1 junior golfer in the country			1
the 21 - year - old impressed many following sunday 's big victory with his manners and affable manor as well as his golfing skills			1
as he stepped off the final green he embraced , in turn , his father @entity49 , his mother @entity48 , his college sweetheart @entity43 , his brother @entity44 , who plays college basketball , his grandfather and various friends			0
he then went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space			0

he 's polite , he 's humble , he handles himself so well , on and off the golf course			1

' the one family member who was n't present to enjoy the celebrations was @entity69 's 14 - year - old sister @entity74 , who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum			1
the siblings regularly facetime each other and every time they talk @entity74 asks he brother if he has won yet			2
' i 'll finally be able to tell her yes , ' he said , smiling			0
' i know she was watching on television and i think she 's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green , ' he said			2
