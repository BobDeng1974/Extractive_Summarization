by @entity1 reporter published : 00:02 est , 3 august 2013 updated : 00:08 est , 3 august 2013 three million @entity3 customers in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 lost access to @entity9 programming in a fee dispute on friday , threatening their ability to watch popular shows like ' @entity13 ' or see @entity14 pursue his 8th win at the @entity16			1
the nation 's second largest cable operator said that @entity9 refused to have productive negotiations , which were repeatedly extended after their previous deal expired at the end of june			1
as friday 's blackout stretched past a couple of hours , it appeared consumers would be caught in the crossfire for some time			0
@entity9 blackout : @entity3 has pulled the plug on @entity9 in several cities in a dispute over broadcasting fees ' it 's become clear that no matter how much time we give them , they 're not willing to come to reasonable terms , ' @entity3 said			1
multiple stations that carry @entity9 programming in @entity4 and @entity5 were replaced around 2:15 p.m. @entity38 with a message from @entity3 saying that @entity9 had ' demanded an outrageous increase ' in the fees it demands to carry its tv stations ' signals			1
@entity9 said it regretted @entity3 's decision , calling it ' ill - advised			1
' the broadcaster said it asked for an extension , but that @entity3 did n't agree to it			0
most of the cable subscribers affected live in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , but customers in other markets also lost signals			1
three million @entity3 customers in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 see this message when they switch channel to @entity9 the @entity9 stations that went dark are @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity4 ; @entity57 and @entity58 in @entity5 ; @entity59 and @entity60 in @entity6 ; @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity63 ; @entity64 , @entity66 - @entity65 in @entity67 ; @entity68 in @entity69 ; @entity70 - @entity65 in @entity71 and @entity72 in @entity73			1
about 2.5 million @entity3 customers also lost access to @entity76 , the premium channel that carries shows such as ' @entity79			1
' @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 channels - all owned by @entity9 - also went dark			1
in its message to subscribers , @entity3 said it would replace the lost programming with shows from @entity88 temporarily			1
the fight centers on the rising fees that tv station owners like @entity9 charge cable and satellite companies to retransmit their content			2
research firm @entity95 estimates retransmission fees will reach $ 3 billion industry - wide this year and double to $ 6 billion by 2018			0
viewers are missing out on @entity9 shows such as ' under the @entity99 ' @entity95 analyst @entity100 said that figure could be revised upward soon as tv station groups merge to gain leverage at the bargaining table			2
for example , @entity105 announced plans to buy @entity108 to form a group of 42 tv stations last month			0
earning revenue from pay tv subscribers is crucial to @entity9 's growth prospects , analysts say			2
even though @entity9 sends its signal out over the airwaves for free to anyone with an antenna , about 85 percent of its viewers watch tv through a pay tv provider			2
such fees ensure the company is not so reliant on advertising dollars , which rise and fall with the economy			0
meanwhile , @entity3 is fighting to hold the line on costs as it struggles to keep subscribers			0
it lost 191,000 cable tv subscribers in the most recent quarter , ending with 11.7 million at the end of june			0
even as the dispute lingered on , both companies posted healthy quarterly earnings this week			0
about 2.5 million @entity3 customers have also lost access to @entity76 , the premium channel that carries shows such as ' @entity79 ' @entity3 grew its net income 6 percent to $ 481 million , or $ 1.64 per share , as revenue rose 3 percent to $ 5.6 billion			1
@entity9 grew net income 11 percent to $ 472 million , or 76 cents per share			2
@entity9 's revenue also grew 11 percent to $ 3.7 billion thanks in large part to the fees that are in dispute with @entity3			1
@entity147 , an analyst with @entity148 , said tv distributors are taking a stand because programming costs are going up about 10 percent this year , an increase that 's too high to pass onto customers			2
' they feel pressure when some of these cost drivers are going up the way they are , ' @entity147 said			0
' they do need to show some teeth and try to negotiate something better			0
' he said the dispute would probably end quickly to avoid depriving customers of key sporting events , like the @entity166 starting on thursday			0
@entity9 also airs its first preseason @entity168 game aug. 23			0
@entity3 subscribers are set to miss out on the chance to watch @entity14 at the @entity166 as a result of the dispute			0

customers in @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 have lost access to @entity9 programming in a fee dispute
