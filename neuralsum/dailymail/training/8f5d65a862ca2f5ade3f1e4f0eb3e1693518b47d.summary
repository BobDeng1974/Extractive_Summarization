@entity0 is on a mission to make sure no one loses their joy this holiday season			1
the sometime actor and full - time evangelical @entity6 recently posted a video on his @entity9 page for all the ladies out there , and he knows just what they need to make this @entity13 truly special - cooking , cleaning , singing and decorating			2
he also wants them to know that they are ' irreplaceable			0
' if you are a mom , if you are a wife , if you 're the keeper of your home , i want you to know that your joy is so important this @entity13			2
' @entity44 is what @entity13 is all about according to @entity0 , and stolen joy can sap a person 's strength he explains , before declaring the best way for a woman to experience joy during this very special time of the year			1
' let your children , your family , see your joy in the way that you decorate your home this @entity13 , in the food that you cook , the songs you sing , the stories you tell , and the traditions that you keep , ' says @entity0			1
' invite your whole neighborhood into your @entity13 , and invite the world into our story of our king and his kingdom			0
' he then plugs his new movie , which is in theaters today , @entity0 's @entity67			1
the @entity69 is calling the film an ' unholy mess , ' while the @entity72 declares it ' one of the least artful holiday films ever made			1
' devoted husband : @entity0 has been married to wife @entity75 ( above ) for 23 years @entity0 also took some time to talk to all of his male followers , and again promote his film , in a second video on his @entity9 page this week			1
this time around it was less about joy , and more about what the manly thing to do is this holiday season			1
our example in our family 's life is so important at @entity90			0
so be all in this year			0
do n't be a @entity91			0
support the women in your life , ' says the former @entity96 star			0

' and you know what another amazing thing you could do is ? take your whole family and see @entity67			0
' former glory : @entity0 shot to fame playing @entity96 on the popular show @entity96 ( above with @entity122 ) and for those who do n't manage to catch @entity67 in theaters , but are hoping to see @entity0 back in the spotlight , he will likely be making a television cameo on the popular reality series 19 kids and counting in the very near future as he attended the wedding of @entity131 earlier this month			2
@entity0 declared @entity133 's decision to not even kiss her future husband before their wedding day admirable , and took his two teenage daughters with him so they could see what he deemed a very special moment			2
@entity141 has long been incredibly sacred to @entity0 , with the actor refusing to even kiss other women while filming , and demanding his wife @entity75 serve as a stand - in for all scenes that require any tonsil hockey .			2
