from twilight to @entity4 , fans of sci fi and fantasy franchises are known for their levels of dedication			0
they immerse themselves in the world of their favourite characters by dressing up as them , collecting the merchandise and even going to conventions to meet others who share their passion			0
but some take it even further than this , spending thousands of pounds and travelling the world in pursuit of the actors who brought their favourite character to life			0
it 's something actor @entity24 , 27 , is familiar with having grown up on screen playing @entity26 in the @entity27			1
her name was @entity29 and she would be waiting for him outside hotels , film premieres and events he attended desperate for a glimpse of the star and hopefully a picture or autograph			2
@entity24 said : ' @entity29 follows me to every event i attend			1
i 'm sure she has the best intentions but it is a little unnerving			0
' i first spotted her when i had a press tour in @entity57 and i noticed this women following me around , she seemed to have an obsession with me and always seems to know where i am			0
' why does a middle - aged woman have an obsession with back then , a teenage boy ? ' he added that he knows @entity29 means no harm and he finds her ' sweet ' but he said : ' she has followed my career for seven years , ultimately i am baffled as to why she wants to see me and what she wants from me			1
' once , @entity29 , 56 , from @entity66 , waited for four hours outside an event he was attending to give him a card telling him she was sorry his dog had died after the star revealed he 'd lost a pet on social media			1
so intrigued as to why @entity29 follows him around the world at her own time and expense , @entity24 decided to investigate the psyche behind the superfan for a @entity80 documentary that airs on @entity81 tonight			1
he even visited @entity29 's house and , surrounded by signed pictures of himself and posters of his friends and @entity27 co-stars , he learnt why he has come to mean so much to @entity29			1
she explained : ' i went out and brought the first one after that , that was it , it spiralled			0
' when i saw @entity91 and saw this blonde slimy git after @entity27 , i thought ummm i 'm going to start watching him			1
i think to start off with it was the character @entity26 i liked and then gradually i got to like you , you 're lovely			2
@entity29 said the actors feel like family to her because she has watched them grow up on screen @entity29 said she has enjoyed watching @entity24 grow up from being a boy as @entity26 in the first @entity27 films , left , to the man he is today , right @entity24 with ( from left to right ) @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 promoting @entity27 and the @entity110 in 2009 ' i wanted the autographs to feel closer to you , it was like a little connection			1
i have never had a family and following @entity27 and watching you all grow up it was like seeing my own family grow up and i got attached			1
you seemed like a big family and i wanted to be part of that			0
' @entity24 got a taste of just what this is like when he joined fans outside a @entity127 theatre to catch a glimpse of @entity105 aka @entity129			2
he experienced the excitement , anticipation and the buzz the fans get from meeting their favourite star			0
he spoke to his @entity27 friends and co-stars and author @entity37 to see how they have dealt with this kind of attention			2
@entity27 himself , actor @entity106 , said : ' it 's definitely a weird thing when are aware you account for a large part of someone 's life who you do n't know and who does n't know you - but thinks they do			1
' having an obsession with a character in a book is fine but when you are obsessed with someone you do n't have anything about ... i 'm more comfortable with people being obsessed with @entity27 than obsessed with me			2
' actor @entity24 meets @entity154 , the ' world 's biggest @entity27 fan ' who has spent thousands on merchandise and even has @entity37 's autograph tattooed on his arm @entity24 tried to get inside the heads of superfans by joining in a @entity4 convention on the show he also meets other @entity27 superfans and learns that many of them have found solace in the world of @entity168 when their own lives have been difficult			1

@entity154 told @entity24 his obsession started when he was bullied at school			1
' i did n't fit in , i was a skinny nerd who liked to dance rather than play baseball			0
i really identified with who @entity27 is			2
' but the film fan admitted it 's the characters , not the actors who play them , he loves but most of all he adores writer @entity37			0
so much so that he has her signature tattooed on his forearm			0
the actor also dressed up as @entity195 's @entity194 to experience the thrill of being a fan he said : ' if @entity37 walked through the door now you would see me lose it completely , shaking , crying freaking out			0
