by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 11 june 2012 updated : 08:44 est , 11 june 2012 two @entity3 students survived a week lost in a blizzard - hit @entity5 mountain range by taking regular dips in hot thermal springs they had stumbled across , rescuers said today			1
@entity9 and @entity10 , both 21 , had planned a two - day trek on the @entity13 's rugged @entity12 but ended up spending more than a week in the wilderness after a snowstorm hit			1
they survived by rationing their meagre supplies of peanut butter and rice and eventually walked to safety after nine days			1
the two students , on a foreign study program in @entity5 with @entity24 , had planned to hike and camp for a few days at some hot springs			1
survival : @entity9 and his girlfriend @entity10 survived for nine days on a mountain in @entity5 with only meagre supplies but heavy rain and a snowstorm during the @entity33 winter prevented the couple from being able to cross a river and return			1
' unfortunately it rained and rained , day after day , and snowed , ' @entity9 said			1
he said the nights were tough to take because the rain and sleet pounded down on the tarpaulin covering their sleeping hammock and the river roared - reminding them all the time of their predicament			2
when they realised they were going to be stuck they started rationing : ' a biscuit and jelly one day , ' @entity9 wrote ' and even less another			1
' @entity9 's mother @entity50 , of @entity51 , @entity52 , said she panicked when she first found out her son was missing			1
' it 's too much for a mom , ' she said			0
' especially when they 're that far away			0
i just felt so helpless			0
' inhospitable : the couple were trapped on a mountain in the @entity60 on @entity5 's @entity13 for nine days before they walked to safety while a helicopter was searching for them she had faith that @entity9 , an environmental science major , knew the outdoors well enough to survive , she said , adding that @entity10 , who is studying graphic design , is a strong woman			1
the couple 's ordeal began on june 1 when friend @entity71 dropped them off at a national park on the @entity13 's @entity12 so they could hike in and camp for a few days			1
' they were just going to the hot springs , to chill out and study for finals , ' she said			2
it was eight days before she realised they were missing and raised the alarm			2
the couple did n't take much food - some carrots , rice , peanut butter and trail mix , said police sergeant @entity88 , who coordinated rescue attempts			2
he said that after three days , a steady rain started			2
hot springs : @entity9 and @entity10 dipped into hot pools to keep warm and slow down energy loss as they survived on the mountain for more than a week ' then on wednesday the snowstorm hit and it got progressively worse , ' @entity88 said			1
@entity9 said that soaking in the hot pools ' helped keep us warm and slow energy loss			1
' it was n't until sunday that the river finally seemed safe enough to cross again			0
he prepared for their hike out by cooking up a ' good meal ' of rice , marshmallows , peanut butter and chocolate , he said			2
' we then left and crossed the icy waters only up to our waist , ' he said			0
' we were climbing the mountains under the dense tree cover when we first heard the helicopter we assumed was looking for us			0
the helicopter never saw us and we walked out just fine and met up with the search and rescue by the road			0
' it was when they attended a debriefing , he added , that ' we found out what a big deal all this was			0
' the student said he relied on his past experience hiking and camping and felt confident in the couple 's ability to survive			0
' i believe when you go into the bush you take your life into your own hands and need to be prepared to handle whatever conditions occur , ' he said			0
' we could have been more prepared , but in the end we were prepared enough to walk ourselves out			0
' beauty spot : the @entity60 national park on @entity5 's @entity13 where the couple went missing			0

@entity143 and @entity10 walked to safety when conditions relented before rescuers could find them
their friend who dropped them off for the two - day hike did not realise they were missing for eight days
@entity9 , 21 , said the hot pools helped keep them warm and slow energy loss
