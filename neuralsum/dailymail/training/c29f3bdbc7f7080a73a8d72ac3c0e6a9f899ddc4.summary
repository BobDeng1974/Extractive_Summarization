by @entity0 dr @entity1 , headteacher at @entity2 on the @entity3 , defended the school 's uniform policy and said it helped behaviour issues in classes the headteacher of a secondary school where more than 250 girls were taken out of lessons because their skirts were too short has defended the ‘ uniform crackdown ’			1
dr @entity1 , headteacher at @entity2 on the @entity3 , said the school ’s uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness in a letter sent to parents today			1
the school , which has around 1,120 pupils , wrote to parents on june 9 to inform them it would be clamping down on ' inappropriate ' clothing and said those who continued to breach the uniform policy would be sent home to change			1
as part of the crackdown , girls - aged between 11 and 18 - whose skirts were deemed too short , were either sent home yesterday or placed in an isolated hall			2
others were also sent home to change because their trousers were ‘ too tight ’ and did not fit with the school ’s strict new policy			1
and boys were also reportedly turned away after arriving at lessons with non-leather shoes			0
dr @entity1 today defended the decision to send pupils home and claimed several girls were under peer pressure to wear inappropriate uniform			1
he said : ‘ we are preparing students for the world of work so it is important that we teach students about the importance of managing their appearance and working to a dress code			1
‘ dealing with uniform issues helps us to improve general attitudes of co-operation and the skills of following instructions			2
‘ this helps us to improve behaviour and learning in classrooms			0
‘ a significant number of teachers have already commented on how much better behaviour in lessons has become , as soon as we started dealing with uniform issues			2
’ ‘ we would normally deal with uniform issues at the beginning of september			2
‘ however , we have a number of female students who have recently said that they are coming under peer pressure to wear their skirts shorter than they feel comfortable			1
‘ it is not fair that girls should be made to feel uncomfortable when they are just following the uniform policy			1
‘ we have therefore decided to act at this point in time , to correct uniform issues			2
’ he said the school had issued uniform guidance to parents on several occasions during the year and that there was a gallery of photos on the academy ’s website showing the interpretation of uniform rules			1
@entity94 , 14 , was sent home from @entity2 twice in one day			1
once because her skirt was too short and again when her trousers were deemed ' too tight '			0
her mother @entity98 , 39 , said : ' it was an absolute joke ' dr @entity1 said he had written to parents on june 9 warning them that there would be a focus on uniform yesterday and teachers would ‘ send students home , or educate them apart , if their uniform was not right ’			1
the headteacher said the current uniform policy had been in place for three years and that the school would only send home older pupils who were told to change and return to the school as quickly as possible			1
he said other pupils wearing inappropriate uniform would be educated away from the mainstream academy but that if the numbers swelled to more than 30 they would be sat in the hall and work under exam conditions			2
he said : ‘ we have received a number of phone calls and requests for meetings over the last few days			0
‘ we will be aiming to get back to parents over the next few days , but i hope that my summary of matters here provides useful interim information			0
’ @entity132 , from @entity133 , @entity3 , said her 14 - year - old daughter @entity134 had been sent home twice on the same day , for having a skirt that was too short and then trousers that were too tight			1
the 39 - year - old mother - of - two said : ‘ it was an absolute joke			0
it has been a nightmare			0
‘ i just ca n’t understand why the school have decided to do it five weeks before the end of the year			2
' the school had an inset day on monday and we spent the whole day trying to find a new skirt			0
' i finally bought one for eight pounds and thought it would be perfect - it was knee length			0
' but when she went to school she was immediately sent home because they said her skirt was too short			2
' it was the perfect size , it was not " too short " - i would not have bought it otherwise			0
' @entity134 is so little , she is so skinny , bless her , and it was a perfect fit , we were all really happy and sure it would pass their new strict policy			0
' but when she phoned me at 8am , i could n't believe it			0
' @entity162 ( pictured left with mother @entity163 and father @entity164 ) was sent home for wearing the wrong trousers , while @entity167 , 13 , ( pictured right with his mother @entity168 ) was told off for having non-leather shoes the single mother , who works as a waitress in a pub in @entity173 , @entity174 , said she was forced to go down to the school after being told her daughter was to be sent home			2
she said : ' i rushed down to pick her up and was told she was being sent home because her skirt was too short			0
' i then took her into @entity133 to buy some trousers which cost another £ 15			0
' but when she went back to school she was told they were " too tight " and they sent her home - again			2
' around 200 children in year 7 and @entity186 were sent to the assembly hall for the whole day for " isolation " and did not have any lessons			0
' another 100 children in year 9 and @entity191 were sent home , including some boys because their shoes were not leather			0
' that means 300 children have been sent home which is ridiculous			0
i ca n't believe their education is suffering because of this			0
' a number of girls do wear short skirts to school so i understand why the school had to make a change			0
' but this is not the way to do it - too many people have suffered because of this			0
' dr @entity1 , headteacher at @entity2 on the @entity3 , said the school 's uniform policy was being enforced as a matter of fairness and said some girls felt peer pressured into wearing shorter skirts however , dr @entity1 said the academy has ' high expectations ' of its students			1
he said : ' we are grateful to the very many parents who support us on a day to day basis by ensuring that their children arrive at the @entity2 in the agreed uniform , and help to uphold the standards of dress / uniform that @entity2 expects			1
' the governors and staff are conscious that we are preparing students for the world of work and so it is important that our students understand the importance of managing their appearance and working within the framework of a dress code			1
' it is not the first time dr @entity1 ’s strict rules on school uniform have hit the headlines			1
in september 2011 , as headmaster of @entity246 in @entity247 , he sent home 109 pupils on the first day of his new job for wearing the wrong uniform			1
he sent scores of pupils home , or gave them after - school detention , for wearing trainers with @entity255 , the wrong trousers , an unsuitable school bag and , in one case , a gold hairband , as well as for failing to bring a pencil , paper , rubber and ruler with them to class , while dozens were put in an isolation centre for disrupting lessons .			1
