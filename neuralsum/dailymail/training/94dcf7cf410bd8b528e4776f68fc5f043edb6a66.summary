a small stone container unearthed half - century ago has now been recognised as further evidence of a @entity3 or @entity4 presence in @entity5			1
the discovery was made when the interior of a container , which was unearthed in @entity9 , was found to contain bronze as well as small spherules of glass			1
archaeologists believe the stone vessel was a crucible for melting bronze by a metalworker , likely in order to cast it into small tools or ornaments , during the centuries around 1000 ad			1
a small stone container unearthed half - century ago has now been recognised as further evidence of a @entity3 or @entity4 presence in @entity5 scientists claim this is the earliest evidence of high - temperature metalworking north of @entity28 – an area that describes @entity30 and @entity31 before the 1500s			2
scientists believe indigenous peoples of northern @entity35 did not practice high - temperature metalworking			0
instead , archaeologists believe norse seafarers travelled via @entity39 to parts of @entity5 where they came into contact with the @entity43 people			1
@entity9 , in the territory of @entity45 , is the largest island in @entity5 and the fifth largest island in the world the discovery was made when the interior of a container , which was unearthed in @entity9 ( pictured ) , was found to contain bronze as well as small spherules of glass the @entity43 were hunters who occupied parts @entity39 and the @entity55 eastern @entity5 2,000 years before @entity56 moved in from @entity57			1
they survived on sea mammals such as seals and walrus , often lived on the coasts in skin - covered tens and made ornaments from bone , ivory , or wood			0
up until now , the view of the @entity43 culture had been that they were a very isolated people with very little contact with anyone			1
@entity75 beads ( left ) in @entity76 matched the blue glass found in @entity79 's death mask ( right ) another northern @entity81 discovery this week unearthed previously unknown trade routes for glass between @entity84 , the @entity85 and @entity76 in the @entity75			0
the discovery was made after @entity75 beads found in @entity76 matched the blue glass inlays found in @entity79 's gold death mask			0
twenty - three blue beads unearthed in an @entity93 grave , south of @entity90 , were analysed using a technique known as plasma - spectrometry , the method allowed researchers to analyse the fragile bead and compare the chemical composition of trace elements with material from @entity102 in @entity84 and @entity103 in @entity104			0
the comparison showed that the chemicals matched exactly , marking the first time that @entity109 and @entity85 cobalt glass has been found outside the @entity111 area			0
researchers from the @entity113 in @entity76 and the @entity114 in @entity115 say the latest study shows that as well as amber , @entity76 and @entity84 traded glass 3,400 years ago they also believe it links two ancient sun cults , based on the fact that sunlight is able to penetrate the surface of both amber and glass			0
' the crucible adds an intriguing new element to this emerging chapter in the early history of northern @entity5 , ' said lead author dr @entity129 , an honorary research fellow at the @entity130			2
dr @entity131 has spent 15 years recovering other specimens in @entity5 that resemble those used by @entity81 of the @entity3 and @entity135 periods			2
' it may be the earliest evidence of high - temperature nonferrous metalworking in @entity35 to the north of what is now @entity31 , ' she said			0
archaeologists believe @entity4 seafarers travelled to parts of @entity5 where they came into contact with the @entity43			1
these were hunters who occupied parts @entity39 and the @entity55 eastern @entity5 2,000 years before @entity56 moved in from @entity57			2

the @entity9 container held bronze and small spherules of glass
it may have been used as a crucible for melting bronze by a metalworker
it could have belonged to @entity4 seafarers who travelled to @entity5
up until now , the indigenous @entity43 hunters were thought to have been a very isolated people with very little contact with anyone outside of tribe
