by @entity0 published : 17:52 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 01:10 est , 25 june 2013 @entity2 lived a double life for years , infiltrating radical anti-racist groups on behalf of his @entity6 employers			1
the officer , who claims one of his tasks was to ‘ dig dirt ’ on the key witness in the @entity13 case – @entity14 – says he immersed himself in his work , seducing female members of the groups he joined and even participating in violence			1
the son of a @entity22 mother and a @entity24 father brought up in @entity25 , his parents divorced at the age of 12 and mr @entity2 said his childhood left him with ‘ a lot of suppressed rage ’ and aggression , useful qualities for posing as a left - wing activist			2
but the career adviser said he might have more success joining @entity6			2
to this end , he enrolled with the @entity44 and graduated top of his class from @entity48 police college in 1986			2
following four years in uniform , he joined @entity6			1
his undercover unit was known by colleagues as the ‘ hairies ’ because they grew long hair and beards to resemble the agitators they targeted			0
they adopted false identities – acquired by stealing the identities of real people who would have been about the same age but died as children – and were given a flat , vehicles and ‘ cover ’ jobs to help them blend in			0
at short notice , mr @entity2 was told he would have to pose as a @entity68 and infiltrate one of the anti-racist groups which had grown in popularity following @entity13 ’s murder			1
strangely for someone who was supposed to be keeping a low profile , he was given a big leaving party before his deployment – knowing he would not see his police friends for at least five years			2
mr @entity2 claims his superiors ordered him to monitor @entity13 ’s family and even smear the campaign			1
he told the @entity81 their aim was to calm the growing movement around @entity13 ’s death and ‘ stop it in its tracks ’			2
one of his first objectives was to gain the trust of a key anti-fascist leader at @entity91 ’s @entity90			0
posing as a dyslexic mature student – he enrolled at the college and quickly made himself known by punching a man who made a racist remark to a dinner lady in the canteen			0
the leaders of the group were impressed by his zeal and enlisted him to join marches against the @entity102			0
he set out to prove himself to the group , even attacking the police during a weekend demonstration so nobody would suspect he was working as an undercover officer			1
they were so convinced that they allowed him to take an active part in the violent demonstration against a @entity102 bookshop in @entity113 , south - east @entity91 just weeks after @entity13 ’s murder			1
@entity14 ( left ) , who witnessed the murder of his friend @entity13 ( right ) , was targeted by @entity2 during the undercover operation mr @entity2 was on one of the 550 coaches of demonstrators who travelled to the march , and said he turned up prepared to participate in ‘ the biggest ruck since the poll tax riots ’			1
officers decided to pounce when @entity13 ’s friend @entity14 , who witnessed the teenager ’s fatal stabbing , said he had attended the @entity113 demonstration			1
police started to trawl through footage of the disorder and charged @entity14 with criminal damage five months later			2
the intelligence was their first major breakthrough as they tried to undermine the @entity13 case because it showed @entity14 was a ‘ violent activist ’ , mr @entity2 told @entity139 ’s dispatches			1
a judge later threw out the case over an abuse of legal process			0
the trust he managed to gain in @entity113 allowed him to become the @entity145 and @entity146 branch secretary of @entity147 – a leading left - wing organisation that acted as a front for some of its more militant members			0
@entity2 retired in 2001 and later received an out - of - court settlement from the @entity44 his rise was partly due to his willingness to take on time - consuming , boring administrative roles			1
but his involvement was so extensive that he had to be careful he did not end up running the group he was sent to bring down			0
mr @entity2 lived in his cover flat six days a week and rarely saw his wife and two young sons			1
he immersed himself completely within the group – even sleeping with two members			0
‘ you ca n’t be in that world full time for five years and never have a girlfriend or boyfriend , ’ he added			0
‘ people would start to ask questions			0
’ while sex with activists was considered acceptable , there was an unofficial rule that you must ‘ never fall in love ’ while undercover			0
he eventually returned to normal duties in 1997 and was awarded a special commendation for his outstanding performance in a ‘ prolonged sensitive operation ’			0
mr @entity2 was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder			0
he retired in 2001 and later brought legal action against the @entity44 , receiving an out - of - court settlement .			1

@entity2 , who worked for @entity6 , went undercover for years
told to ' dig dirt ' on @entity14 who saw @entity13 murder
@entity2 said he seduced women in groups he joined
rarely saw wife and children during operations
retired in 2001 and was awarded out - of - court settlement from @entity44
