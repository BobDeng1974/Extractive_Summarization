by @entity0 published : 19:23 est , 9 march 2013 updated : 06:29 est , 10 march 2013 could @entity1 may lead the conservative party ? and what kind of leader would she be ? last weekend , this newspaper broke the story that @entity7 wants @entity8 to leave the @entity9			1
yesterday , she confirmed that this is indeed her view			1
‘ are we restricting our ability to act in the national interest ? are we conceding that our own @entity14 is not supreme ? i believe we are , ’ she said			1
‘ i want to be clear that all options – including leaving the convention altogether – should be on the table			1
’ and a @entity19 government will , she confirmed , scrap the @entity20			1
to pull @entity8 out of the @entity9 would be to return justice in this country to where it belongs – into the hands of our own courts , and out of those of a distant and discredited institution which declares that prisoners should have the right to vote			1
but mrs may did not take this bold stance in isolation			1
it formed part of the first - ever speech in which she set out her political world view – ranging outside her @entity41 brief to set out a deeply personal political manifesto			1
it was a declaration of intent , confirming that she intends to be a candidate for the @entity19 leadership if @entity48 loses the next general election			1
so could mrs may really lead the @entity19 ? and , if so , what kind of leader would she be ? i worked alongside her as a @entity19 mp in a neighbouring constituency ( i was the mp for @entity56 , she for @entity57 ) for the best part of ten years			1
she was an exemplary neighbour – helpful and supportive			1
all in all , she had all the qualities of what @entity19 mps call ‘ a good colleague ’ , save one – clubability , that mix of approachability and gregariousness that helps mps to rub along together			1
mrs may was a cat who walks by itself			1
in the lobbies where mps vote , they tend to mix in groups , exchanging news , jokes , information and gossip			1
but while other mps would look for friends , mrs may would stalk through alone , halting only for an occasional pleasantry or to buttonhole a colleague about political business , but never part of a group or gang			1
and with that sense of solitude came a fierce sense of territoriality			1
woe betide any unhappy mp or fellow frontbencher who trespassed into her territory or , worse , made a grab for part of it			2
i saw this at first - hand when she clashed with @entity98 over setting up a new integration ministry			2
at the time , mrs may was in charge of the party ’s approach to ethnic minorities , as well as women , and @entity98 ’s plan would have torn off a slice of her empire			2
mrs may clashed with @entity108 over plans to set up a new integration ministry since i worked in the same team as @entity98 , i went to the meeting at which the idea was set out			2
mrs may received us pleasantly and graciously and @entity98 began to make her pitch			2
as soon as she did , the smile on our host ’s face turned wintry			2
@entity98 had scarcely finished before mrs may launched a blood - drawing counter-attack , utilising every bureaucratic device in the book to kill the scheme at birth			2
mrs may is a formidable operator , but not always one who commands the affection of those who work with her			2
some senior ministers allow their juniors the freedom to flourish			2
others try to control everything themselves			0
almost all of mrs may ’s colleagues place her in the latter camp			0
when she returns home late at night after a division in the commons or desk work at the @entity41 , there will be few distractions from the toil of churning through the paperwork in those ministerial red boxes			0
this picture helps to capture the sense of isolation that somehow surrounds her			0
but that concentration has served her well			0
in a department notorious for imperilling the careers of those who serve there , she has prospered			0
she is unwaveringly focused on reducing crime , reforming the police and , above all , reducing net immigration – the figures for which are moving in the right direction			0
and that iciness is melting a bit			0
the @entity141 has changed since the last election			0
the conservatives now have some 50 women @entity166 , and mrs may seems more at ease with the new generation of @entity169 whose votes will be crucial in any future leadership election			0
comparisons are being made betwen @entity7 and @entity174 chancellor @entity173 she has an energetic team in the @entity41 behind her , and the services of a sociable aide – @entity178 , the mp for @entity179 and her parliamentary private secretary – to draw on			0
senior mps , such as the former cabinet minister @entity182 , speak admiringly of her work in government			1
and the home secretary is now offering informal ‘ surgeries ’ at the back of the @entity141 tearoom each week			0
a year ago , her lack of clubability seemed to leave her an unlikely future @entity19 leader			1
but since then , she has put herself at the head of the ‘ @entity194 of ministers ’ – the team of @entity198 members , including @entity199 and @entity200 – who have had enough of cuts to their departments			1
one minister spoke appreciatively to me recently of how well she performs in @entity198 , and how , when necessary , she is prepared to stand up to @entity205 , the most powerful man in the government			0
her team have been busy marketing her as ‘ the @entity208 ’ , a future equivalent of the dour but effective @entity174 chancellor			0
the only element lacking to date in her quiet leadership campaign has been a wider view of politics to accompany the grasp of detail			0
and now we have it			0
‘ we have to become the party that is tireless in confronting vested interests , ’ she said yesterday			0
‘ the party that takes power from the elite and gives it to the people			0
’ it was an appeal perfectly pitched for the marginal seats that her party must win in 2015			0
it confirmed that she is ready to lead if @entity48 falls – not just after the election but before it , if his disillusioned party overthrows him .			0

has all the qualities of what @entity19 mps call ' a good colleague '
but lacks ' clubability ' and instead likes to tread her own path
performing well in cabinet meetings *objecting* to further departmental cuts
