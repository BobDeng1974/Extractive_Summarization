there have been rocks that look like traffic lights , and even a perfectly rounded stone discovered on the surface of @entity5			1
but the latest bizarre formation appears to show a rock in the shape of a cannon			2
@entity10 has been beaming photos from the red planet since its @entity13 landed in august 2012 , and this latest discovery was spotted by amateur astronomer @entity15 , 45 , from @entity16			1
mr @entity15 said : ' i think it looks like an artillery piece - but it 's way too small for that really			0
' @entity25 image of a cannon pictured right the 45 - year - old space video journalist said he noticed a chuck of rock in the corner of footage while scanning @entity10 's official images			1
he said : ' i think it looks like a gun - as in an artillery piece - but it 's way too small for that really			0
' last month , a perfectly rounded rock was also spotted on the @entity5 surface , and continuing the cannon analogy , it looks similar to a cannonball			1
the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second			0
curiosity is the fourth rover to visit @entity5			1
it took around seven minutes to land on the @entity5			2
the rover is fitted with 17 cameras			0
it weighs about the same as a @entity50 at approximately 900kg ( 2,000lbs )			0
scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on @entity53			0
the same week , a rock shaped like a traffic light was also spotted as @entity13 roamed around the base of @entity5 ' @entity57			1
in the image , a set of three large rocks - admittedly with a larger fourth one as well - are shown being stacked on top of each other			0
they bear a striking resemblance to traffic lights on @entity66			0
but it ’s highly unlikely this same feature was built by a martian civilisation			0
the image was shot from the six - foot ( 1.8 metre ) high , left - hand side mast cam on the @entity13			0
the ' traffic light ' rock was also spotted by mr @entity15 , who runs a @entity74 channel called @entity75			1
‘ i saw this one and i thought “ hang on , that looks a bit strange ”			0
i think it looks like a traffic light			1
‘ it is hard to tell how big it would be without any point of reference , but i would estimate it was about 12 inches [ 30.5cm ]			0
‘ i posted it on the internet and people said they thought it looked like a set of traffic lights too - although some people did say it looked like a totem pole			2
’ the curiosity rover recently spotted a rock that looks like traffic lights on @entity5 ( shown in the red ring in this image )			1
@entity101 - based @entity10 is yet to comment on the latest discovery			1
the finding highlights just how weird and wonderful some of the rock formations on @entity5 can be the ' traffic lights ' ( left ) were spotted by @entity13 ( right ) on its way to the base of @entity57 , a geologically fascinating region that could explain how @entity5 lost its wet and habitable environment			1
other people have said the strange looking rock resembles a totem pole the rock was spotted by space video journalist @entity15			2

i think it looks like a traffic light ' ( stock image shown )			1
the image from @entity13 is just one of many fascinating rocks on the red planet that resembles something we are familiar with on @entity66 just days earlier , @entity13 spotted the ball - shaped rock on the surface of @entity5			1
@entity10 said it was likely an example of @entity5 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter , according to @entity137			1
curiosity is currently at the base of @entity57 , which has been the target for the mission since it landed just over two years ago			2
the area is geologically fascinating as it contains layers that may provide an insight into the history of @entity5			2
and , scientists hope the region might reveal how and why @entity5 lost what was once thought to be a habitable environment , with water flowing on its surface			2
this , in turn , may provide answers on the future of @entity66			0
the discovery follows another intriguing image that showed an almost perfectly round rock on the @entity151 ( shown )			1
@entity10 said it was likely an example of @entity5 concretion , the process of compacting and hardening a mass of matter			2
continuing the cannon analogy , it also looks like a cannonball last month , @entity168 's first mission to @entity5 , the @entity170 's @entity169 , arrived at @entity5 and released its first image ( shown ) of the red planet 's surface			1
' @entity174 ? keep in touch			0
i 'll be around ' the team for the orbiter tweeted on its arrival			0
