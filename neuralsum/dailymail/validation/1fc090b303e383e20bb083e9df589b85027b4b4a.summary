animal rights activists were stunned when the parent company of @entity2 , @entity3 , announced it would eliminate elephants from its circuses by 2018			1
the elephants will then be retired to a conservation center in @entity8			1
' monumental and long overdue , ' was how the @entity9 put it			0
' startling and tremendously exciting , ' the @entity11 said in a statement			0
and the @entity13 called it ' a giant step in the right direction			0
' but activists soon focused on the timing , questioning why it will take three years to phase out the elephants from the traveling circus shows			2
elephants perform at the @entity2 , at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity8			1
the @entity2 said it will phase out its iconic elephant acts by 2018 just days before the announcement , @entity26 ( @entity26 ) prevailed in an open - records request and obtained documents proving that , at least since 2010 , @entity2 has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis ( @entity33 )			1
@entity33 is highly transmissible from elephants to humans , even without direct contact			1
a statement from @entity26 frames @entity2 ’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country			1
' these elephants suffer greatly , but now their retirement is vital to everyone ’s safety , ' the statement read			1
@entity26 says the company 's move to retire its elephants heads off a scandal about the animals having @entity33 while touring as many as one - third of the elephants having tested positive for tuberculosis , and several @entity2 employees have been treated for the disease @entity65 , president of @entity26 , said : ' many of the elephants are painfully arthritic , and many have tuberculosis , so their retirement day needs to come now ' the documents obtained by @entity26 reveal that in 2010 , at least 11 elephants with the circus tested positive for @entity33 , and that elephants used by @entity2 have had @entity33 since at least 1978			1
as many as one - third of the elephants having tested positive for the disease , and several @entity2 employees have been treated for @entity33			1
@entity33 carried by an elephant was linked to an outbreak among eight humans at an elephant sanctuary , some of whom had no direct contact with the elephant			1
@entity26 said the documents also show that @entity2 consistently opposed efforts by officials to improve testing requirements for @entity33 in elephants			1
according to former @entity93 attorney @entity92 , who is now the @entity94 compliance officer for @entity3 , @entity33 is ' probably going to be the downfall of @entity97 ’s elephants '			2
@entity65 , president of @entity26 , added : ' many of the elephants are painfully arthritic , and many have tuberculosis , so their retirement day needs to come now			1
' ' if the decision is serious , then the circus needs to do it now			0
' @entity104 ( left ) , ceo of @entity3 , and his daughters , feed elephants at the @entity2 and @entity108 , in @entity109 , @entity8 however , executives at @entity3 , @entity2 's parent company , say it will take three years to build proper facilities for them on the 200 - acre plot of land in central @entity8 that 's already being used as an elephant conservation center			1
they have repeatedly denied that the elephants are mistreated in any way in the circuses			2
' each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area , ' said @entity123 , @entity97 's spokesman , adding that permits , drainage issues and other logistics must be worked out			0
the company intends for the elephants to live out their years on the property , and since one elephant is 69 , they must plan for the long haul to care for the crop of gentle giants			2
the decision to phase out elephants from the @entity2 comes at a time when cities across the @entity138 are cracking down on exotic animal displays			1
even before thursday 's announcement that the elephants will be phased out of @entity2 's performances by 2018 , company officials already said they were pulling out of certain cities because of newly enacted restrictions			1
@entity147 executives said the decision to end the circus 's century - old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length			0
elephants have often been featured on @entity2 's posters over the decades			2
' there 's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers , ' said @entity97 , the company 's executive vice president			0
' a lot of people are n't comfortable with us touring with our elephants			0
' @entity97 owns 43 elephants , 29 of which live at the company 's 200 - acre @entity108 in central @entity8			2
one elephant is on a breeding loan to the @entity168			0
thirteen animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018			2
the company plans to retire its remaining 13 touring elephants to its conservation center in @entity8 in 2018 @entity3 , @entity2 's parent company , say it will take three years to build proper facilities for all thirteen elephants to join the 29 already on site at the 200 - acre plot of land each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area , and permits , drainage issues and other logistics must also be worked out before the elephants can retire to the center another reason for the decision , company president @entity104 said , was that certain cities and counties have passed ' anti-circus ' and ' anti-elephant ' ordinances			1
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year , and @entity97 said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction			0
it 's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations , he said			0
@entity207 , who wrote a book about the freeing of an elephant , called the decision ' earth - moving ' and thought the @entity212 would never change their minds ' all of the resources used to fight these things can be put toward the elephants , ' @entity97 said during an interview at the conservation center			1
' we 're not reacting to our critics ; we 're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the @entity224 elephant			1
' @entity207 , the author of the book ' @entity226 on @entity227 : how @entity228 escaped the @entity229 , ' which is about a @entity231 circus elephant , said she believes the @entity97 family ' realized it was a losing pr battle			0
' ' this is an enormous , earth - moving decision , ' she said			0
' when i heard the news , my jaw hit the floor			0
i never thought they 'd change their minds about this			0
' in 2014 , @entity3 won $ 25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal - rights groups , including the @entity11 , ending a 14 - year legal battle over allegations that @entity2 circus employees mistreated elephants			1
the initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former @entity2 barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $ 190,000 by the animal - rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit			2
the judge called him ' essentially a paid plaintiff ' who lacked credibility and standing to sue			0
the judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial			0
@entity104 testified during that trial about elephants ' importance to the show			2
' the symbol of the ' @entity266 ' is the elephant , and that 's what we 've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years			0
' when asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants , @entity97 replied , ' no , it would n't			0
' the circus will continue to use tigers , dogs and goats , and a @entity279 troupe of camel stunt riders joined its @entity281 show this year			0
the symbol of the ' @entity266 ' is the elephant but @entity3 now admits that the public is no longer comfortable with them touring with elephants , and keeping up with changing regulations is tough the circus business is changing and @entity97 is now investing in more motor sports			1
in 2010 it created a motorcycle stunt show called @entity289 ( pictured ) and has acquired a number of other acts more motor sports , daredevils and feats of human physical capabilities will likely be showcased			1
in 2008 , @entity97 acquired a variety of motor sports properties , including monster truck shows , motocross and the @entity300 , which promotes drag races and other events			2
in 2010 , it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called @entity289			0
roughly 30 million people attend one of @entity97 's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year			0
@entity2 's popular @entity309 - based competitor , @entity308 , features human acts and does n't use wild animals			2
and while @entity312 is phasing out the elephants , other , smaller circuses in the @entity138 — and in countries such as @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 — still use elephants			0
@entity97 owns the largest herd of @entity224 elephants in @entity322			2
it costs about $ 65,000 yearly to care for each elephant			0
@entity104 said initially the conservation center will be open only to researchers , scientists and others studying the @entity224 elephant			1
he said he hopes it eventually expands ' to something the public will be able to see			0
