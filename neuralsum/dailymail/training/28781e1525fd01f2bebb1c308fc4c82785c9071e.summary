by @entity0 @entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 says most see striking as a last resort more than 45,000 rank and file police officers have demanded the right to go on strike			1
in a ballot , one in three members of the @entity2 voted to claim the same industrial rights as other public sector workers			1
currently , police officers are banned by law from taking industrial action			2
but some – furious at @entity16 cuts to pay , pensions and overtime – want to be able to walk out in the same way as teachers , nurses and tube workers			0
of those who voted , 80 per cent were in favour of the @entity2 campaigning for striking rights			1
around 56,333 voted , of whom 45,651 voted in favour			2
but because fewer than half the @entity2 ’s 130,000 members took part in the vote , it is not binding on the staff association ’s leaders			1
this has led to further controversy			0
members of the @entity37 , representing officers in @entity39 , said it was ‘ appalled ’ by the 50 per cent rule			2
they claimed this meant a clear mandate from members was ‘ simply being ignored ’			2
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity46 decided to impose an unachievable threshold of 50 per cent plus one of the entire membership to achieve a result			0
pfew has no rules that justify this decision			0
lost : a ballot of police officers held on the right to take industrial action has failed to reach a high enough majority , even though thousands voted in favour ‘ in effect , it ruled that officers who chose to abstain would be deemed to have voted “ no ”			0
’ the @entity2 represents more than 130,000 officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector			1
pleased : @entity16 minister @entity66 welcomed news that the @entity2 failed in its attempt to overturn a ban on strikes officers are banned from forming trade unions and taking strike action under the @entity74 1919			1
the @entity2 has loudly opposed cuts to police funding of around one fifth , and members marched on @entity79 to show their fury at changes to police pay and perks			1
@entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 , said : ‘ our members value their unique employment status as servants of the @entity88 and i believe the vast majority of them would view industrial action as a last resort			1
’ police minister @entity66 said : ‘ i am pleased the vast majority of police officers do not want the right to strike			0
their work is too important			0
’ earlier this year the @entity16 announced starting salaries for officers with no experience would be cut by nearly a fifth to £ 19,000 a year – less than a trainee manager at @entity100			0
home secretary @entity101 is yet to decide whether to accept a recommendation from @entity103 – the former rail regulator commissioned by the government to examine police pay and conditions – to allow chiefs to sack under - performing officers .			0

@entity2 needed half their *133,000* members to turnout for vote
45,651 wanted to strike and 10,681 were against - not enough to change law
