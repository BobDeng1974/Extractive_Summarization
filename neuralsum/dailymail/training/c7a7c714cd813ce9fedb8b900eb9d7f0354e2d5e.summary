@entity0 arrived at @entity1 last summer as a young man perceived to be entering the last - chance saloon , but on the back of a scoring record at @entity6 that would make him one of the hottest strikers in the current @entity9 season , if replicated			1
but therein lies the enigma of @entity0 , who has held immense promise but a matching capacity to be distracted ever since @entity13 bought him for @entity6 from @entity14 as a young teenager almost eight years ago			1
but having finally scored his first @entity9 goal for @entity1 , and crucially the winner , in tuesday night ’s 3 - 2 win over @entity19 , he will deliver at @entity20 , eventually			1
that at least is his recurring promise and although with @entity0 the ride is never smooth , there are real signs that he won back the faith of his manager @entity27 , is gelling with his team - mates - and that he wants to show the fans he is worth the £ 16million fee and £ 5m - a - year in wages			1
thank you and forza @entity1			2
but now head down and keep working hard			0
' certainly his league goal drought for @entity1 is in the past , his vital strike against @entity19 taking his club tally to three now , after a @entity57 goal over @entity58 in september and a @entity59 win against @entity61 the following month			1
but then goals have generally not been a big problem in his career , when he ’s had periods of stability			0
statistics alone never tell the whole story and that ’s especially true with @entity0			2
but the hard numbers show he has got better with age , despite the many , many hiccups , be they fireworks , bib troubles , bust - ups with team - mates and managers , failed @entity79 back - heels , social media gaffes , and on and on			1
between 17 and 20 at @entity6 , he scored 20 league goals in 59 games for a hit rate of 34 per cent			0
at @entity87 , where he was generally accepted as a maddening flop , his rate of 20 goals in 54 @entity9 games actually rose to 37 per cent			2
@entity0 opened his account for @entity1 against @entity58 in september and now has three goals @entity0 posted this picture and caption on @entity47 after he helped his side to victory against @entity19 @entity0 has consistently posted pictures and messages alluding to his love of the club and his team - mates and in 18 months in @entity6 from early 2013 to last summer , he scored 26 league goals in 43 games , a strike rate of more than 60 per cent			1
the only players doing better in the current @entity9 season are @entity105 ( 17 in 19 for 89 per cent ) , @entity106 ( 14 in 19 , 74 per cent ) , @entity107 ( 13 in 19 , 68 per cent ) and @entity108 ( 13 in 21 , 62 per cent )			2
you want something counter-intuitive ? @entity0 arrived at @entity20 in the form of the current @entity108 , but with several tons of baggage			2
the hope for everyone at @entity1 is he now comes good ; the evidence is that as his confidence grows , he feels - and demonstrates , principally via social media - part of the unit			1
when he ’s not watching @entity119 with his two - year - old daughter , @entity120 , his posts of himself with his team - mates or of his team - mates have come on his ‘ good ’ days			1
the day he scored against @entity58 he posted pictures of @entity124 and @entity125			2
the away win at @entity126 when he was a substitute was a team shot inside the dressing room captioned ‘ oh yes			0
’ last month as his only involvement in one of the @entity59 ties with @entity133 was watching it on his telly , he posted a photograph of himself doing so			0
the caption read : ‘ this illness might prevent me from helping my team on the pitch but it will not stop me from supporting my team off the pitch ! ! come on guys			0
’ and then two days later , he posted a picture of himself with @entity145			0
‘ ca n’t wait , ’ he said , obviously referring to their potential partnership			0
@entity27 then knocked him back by dropping him for the @entity149 tie at home to @entity151 , but also made it clear there was a way back with hard work			0
' i think we have shown here a number of times with players that have been out of the fold , for various reasons , that if they work hard in training , show the intensity and show the focus then they have every chance of getting back in the team - and not only getting back in it but staying in it , ’ he said			1
‘ the opportunity is there for @entity0 , and for every player - not just him			1
’ @entity0 has been supported by manager @entity27 despite struggling to make an impression @entity0 's banner at @entity20 which reads in @entity176 ' i have nothing to declare except my genius ' @entity0 posted the message : ' the time will come when everyone will get what they deserve ' on @entity47 he made it back			1
the comeback win over @entity151 in the replay was followed by more convivial footage with team - mates : @entity125 , @entity145 and @entity189 , all dancing at the @entity191 training ground with @entity0 joining in			1
@entity0 has been promising since october he would come good , since fans displayed a banner saying he had nothing to declare but his genius			0
‘ wow thanks to whoever did this , ’ he said then			0
‘ i know all of you expect more from me ... more goals especially and more genius but give me time and i 'll show is true			0
’ then just last week , in @entity41 , he posted a new quote : ‘ @entity203 dove ognuno avrà quel che si merita ' ( ‘ the time will come when everyone will get what they deserve ' )			0
he clearly expects to come good .			0

@entity0 scored his first @entity9 goal for @entity1
the @entity41 striker netted the winner against @entity19 on tuesday
@entity0 has struggled to make an impact since signing last summer
but he has consistently shown he is *settling* in at @entity1 by posting pictures with his team - mates and showing his support when not playing
