@entity1 fans will be licking their lips at the prospect of signings galore to strengthen their squad for an assault on the @entity7			1
after guiding the @entity9 to a second - place finish in the @entity11 , @entity8 is keen to bring in new faces with the likes of @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 all linked with a move to @entity19			1
but ... a note of caution			0
@entity8 has made 14 signings since taking charge of @entity1 back in 2012 , and only a couple of those have wowed the @entity26			1
@entity28 's @entity27 assesses the @entity1 manager 's signings so far			1
the only way is up : @entity8 is looking to strengthen the @entity1 squad this summer @entity33 ( from @entity34 , £ 10.5million ) the @entity35 is a player @entity8 is keen on after the pair spent time together at @entity38			1
@entity33 arrived at @entity19 as a 21 - year - old who looked to have a big future , but he managed just one goal in the first part of the 2012 - 2013 season , against @entity44 in a @entity46 qualifier			2
it was a nightmare first season and injury threatened to curtail it in february			2
the @entity35 returned ahead of schedule and finally scored his first @entity11 goal in a 6 - 0 thrashing of @entity55			0
having impressed for @entity56 at the @entity57 , @entity33 spent last season on loan at @entity60			2
with his transfer fee not exactly on the small side , it would be easy to label him as a flop			2
however , after scoring four goals in five games to help @entity60 to safety , there are indications the @entity35 could still make his mark in a red shirt			0
@entity75 - @entity74 potential : @entity33 celebrates after scoring against @entity44 in the @entity46 @entity76 ( from @entity77 , £ 15million ) in an episode of the documentary series @entity1 , @entity8 referred to @entity76 as the ' @entity80 '			1
initially , the midfielder 's range of passing was impressive but he soon lost his way and his only goals during his first season came against @entity87 in the @entity88 and @entity89 in the @entity46			2
having rarely featured at the start of last season after falling behind @entity92 in the pecking order , @entity76 has had to fight his way back into the team			2
one game in particular stands out , and that was the 3 - 0 win at @entity96 , during which he was brilliant			0
the 24 - year - old finished the campaign with a regular run in the team and finally scored his first @entity11 goal for @entity1 in a 3 - 3 draw at @entity104			1
next season he must continue his end - of - season form			2
@entity75 - @entity74 on the mark : @entity76 was given an extended run in the team at the end of last season @entity111 ( from @entity112 , £ 2.4million ) the @entity113 struggled to break into the first team at @entity19 during his first season , playing just four games in the @entity11			2
@entity111 spent last season on loan at @entity118 where he made much of an impact			1
his last - minute winner for @entity118 against @entity38 was appreciated by @entity1 fans , but , realistically , the chances of him breaking through at @entity19 are very slim			1
verdict - miss outcast : @entity111 spent last season on loan at @entity118 after failing to impress @entity125 ( from @entity126 , £ 1million ) the @entity127 was highly rated by @entity8 and quickly pounced upon			1
still only 20 years old , @entity125 has n't forced his way into first - team reckoning			0
an anterior cruciate ligament injury ruined his season in the @entity132 last year and he missed a lot of the season			2
there is still time for @entity125 to show what he can do			0
@entity75 - @entity74 talent : @entity125 , pictured playing in the @entity138 , was signed for £ 1million from @entity126 @entity139 ( from @entity38 , £ 12million ) instant hit			1
there 's no better way to win over fans than to score goals			0
@entity139 did that straight away , registering in his first three games in a red shirt			1
after arriving in january , he scored 11 goals in the second half of the 2012 - 2013 season			2
last year , though , he really made his mark			0
with @entity151 suspended for the first part of the season , @entity139 quickly lifted the mood with six goals in his first five games			1
when the @entity157 returned the pair , labelled the ' @entity159 ' , were unstoppable			0
@entity139 finished the season with 25 goals in all competitions after finally being given an extended run as a striker			1
verdict - hit @entity166 : @entity139 was one of the hottest striker in @entity168 last season @entity170 ( from @entity171 , £ 8.5million ) now , that price seems a bargain			1
the @entity174 is very similar to a @entity26 favourite from the recent past , @entity177			0
his trickery , vision and incisive passing fit in very well with @entity8 ' system			1
one thing often overlooked , though , is big goals he scores , as @entity177 did so often			0
@entity170 's deflected effort at @entity186 brought @entity1 level before @entity189 's injury - time penalty secured a 3 - 2 win			1
talking of 3 - 2 victories , who scored the winner against @entity194 in april ? @entity195 , @entity170			1
verdict - hit vital : @entity170 scored the winner against @entity194 in a 3 - 2 win at @entity19 @entity199 ( from @entity200 , £ 7million ) signed for £ 7million last summer , @entity199 arrived at @entity19 as a young central defender with huge promise			1
the 21 - year - old is yet to earn his opportunity in the first team and spent the end of last season on loan at @entity209			0
with @entity1 's defensive problems , @entity199 could fight his wat into contention			2
@entity75 - @entity74 push for the first team : @entity199 ( left ) spent the end of last season on loan at @entity209 @entity214 ( from @entity215 , season - long loan ) with @entity217 compromised by a knee injury , @entity8 moved to bring in the @entity219 left back on loan as cover			1
but @entity214 was never solid enough and soon fell behind @entity222 , who is more naturally comfortable at right back			0
verdict - miss cover : on - loan left - back @entity214 lost his place to youngster @entity222 @entity226 ( from @entity38 , season - long loan ) @entity228 had no idea that he was loaning out @entity226 to a title rival and a team that finished above his @entity38 side			0
@entity226 started well with a goal at @entity77 , but his opportunities were limited			0
that was largely due to the emergence of @entity237			0
verdict - miss limited : @entity226 was kept out of the @entity1 team by @entity237 @entity239 ( from @entity240 , £ 18million ) when the @entity219 arrived on @entity241 , @entity1 hailed @entity239 as a ' marquee signing '			1
it has been a strange first season for @entity239			0
he has found himself in and out of the team , almost on rotation with @entity247			0
while @entity239 still looks clumsy in possession and leaves fans with their heart in mouth every time he makes a challenge , there is talent there			0
after all , he captained @entity240 as a teenager and is likely to start for @entity257 at the @entity258			0
@entity75 - @entity74 solid as a rock ? @entity239 was hailed as a ' marquee signing ' when he arrived at @entity19 @entity261 ( from @entity194 , free ) this initially looked like a good piece of business by @entity8 to bring in an experienced , hardened @entity11 veteran on the cheap			1
but a couple of clangers in early 2014 , most notably the own goal against @entity186 and passing the ball across his own box to @entity272 against @entity273 , have reminded people how error prone he is			0
at 33 years of age , @entity261 is unlikely to be find himself as a starter again			0
verdict - miss costly : free signing @entity261 made a number of huge errors in the early part of 2014 @entity282 ( from @entity60 , £ 9million ) the @entity283 had big shoes to fill at @entity1			1
he stepped straight into a void left by @entity286 , who was first - choice goalkeeper at @entity19 for eight years			0
@entity282 had a debut that dreams are made of , saving a penalty in the 89th minute to preserve @entity1 's 1 - 0 lead over @entity118			1
@entity282 is an excellent shot stopper but , much like his back four , prone to mistakes			0
he rarely looked comfortable when claiming crosses and his howler to let in @entity296 's shot consigned @entity1 to a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity194 in december			2
looking back at the final standings in the title race , those points seem pretty costly now			0
@entity75 - @entity74 dream : @entity282 saved a penalty on his @entity19 debut that secured @entity1 three points @entity305 ( from @entity306 , £ 7.2million ) due to the excellence of @entity151 and @entity139 , @entity305 really has n't had a look in since september			1
having said that , the @entity309 was given a decent run at the start of the season with @entity151 suspended but could n't score			0
in fact , his only goal all season came in the @entity88 against @entity87			0
with @entity1 looking to strengthen and @entity14 's seemingly imminent arrival , there is only one way @entity305 is heading in the pecking order			1
verdict - miss solitary : @entity305 's only goal last season came in the @entity88 against @entity87 @entity322 ( from @entity323 , £ 6.8million ) @entity322 had the kind of season that left many wondering what his favoured role is			0
a forward ? a midfielder ? winger ? no 10 ? the @entity309 has made just nine @entity11 appearances this season with most of those being from the bench			2
he is still only 21 , but will have to work incredibly hard just to get noticed next season with a number of signings expected			2
verdict - miss bit part : @entity322 featured in just nine @entity11 games for @entity1 last season			1

@entity8 has made 14 signings at @entity1 *including* two loans
@entity139 and @entity170 have made the biggest impact
@entity1 looking to strengthen squad for @entity7 next season
@entity14 close to signing for @entity1 from @entity350
@entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16 still top transfer targets
