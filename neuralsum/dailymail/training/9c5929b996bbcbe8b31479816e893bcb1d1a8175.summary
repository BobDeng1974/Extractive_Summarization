by @entity0 the former @entity2 rugby captain has slammed @entity4 bosses for their u-turn on funding cancer treatment former @entity2 rugby captain @entity7 has described @entity4 bosses as a ‘ national disgrace ’ for going back on a deal to fund cutting - edge cancer treatment			1
the sports star , who lost his mother @entity12 to cancer in 2008 , accused the health service of ‘ turning the clock back ’ on cancer treatment by refusing to pay for a revolutionary radiotherapy treatment			1
@entity18 ablative radiotherapy ( @entity19 ) targets beams very precisely at the tumour allowing high doses of radiation to be delivered with less risk of it affecting surrounding organs			0
patients on average need only five visits to hospital , rather than the average of 25 for other cancer treatments , and can usually go home the same day			0
mr @entity7 was asked to work with the @entity4 to devise a plan after he approached @entity35 with concerns that not enough patients had access to the lifesaving treatment			1
but after health bosses ditched the proposal to give it to an extra 2,000 patients , mr @entity7 has accused @entity2 of ‘ going back on its word ’ and written to the health secretary to ask him to intervene			1
in a letter to @entity51 , mr @entity7 said @entity2 had ‘ savaged ’ the availability of the technology ‘ the rest of the civilised world uses as a matter of routine ’ so only a ‘ pitiful number of patients ’ would be treated			2
he wrote : ‘ in my view what @entity2 is doing now is a national disgrace			1
while their new chief executive talks about employing 50 new commissioners and focusing on better management structures , our cancer clinicians are denied the use of technologies to treat patients that the rest of the civilised world uses as a matter of routine			0
’ he added : ‘ the way @entity2 are approaching this is turning the clock back on the way we ’re treating cancer			1
we ’re not just standing still and doing nothing , we ’re turning the clock back			2
’ mr @entity7 was drafted in after he last year wrote to the prime minister to warn that @entity81 was ‘ falling behind the rest of the world ’ in the use of advanced radiotherapy			2
he was asked by @entity51 to work with @entity2 to devise a plan to improve the service and they agreed to a £ 5million deal to more than double the number of patients treated and extend the types of cancer treated			2
@entity7 lost his mother @entity12 to cancer in 2008 and has since raised more than £ 1m for charitable causes @entity2 pledged to conduct clinical trials on using the treatment on spine , liver and pelvis cancers , and ensure it was available in hospitals around @entity81			1
but it has now told mr @entity7 that the clinical trials will not take place , it will only treat half the patients it previously pledged and it will not start the work until april			0
in his letter to mr @entity51 , mr @entity7 wrote : ‘ it is bad enough that @entity2 is going back on its word regarding these patient numbers but we are not even being given a guarantee that the pitiful numbers they are proposing will definitely start being treated in the next financial year			2
‘ i am surprised that you are allowing all of this to happen under your stewardship			0
’ in 2012 , @entity35 promised that all @entity4 patients would get ‘ innovative radiotherapy where clinically appropriate , safe and cost - effective ’			0
@entity7 , pictured playing for @entity2 and @entity120 in 2008 and 2007 respectively , has slammed the @entity4 after the organisation backtracked on clinical trials and the number of patients to receive them new figures compiled by @entity126 , the @entity126 mp , show that the number of patients being offered advanced radiotherapy fell by 10 per cent last year			1
a total of 645 patients were treated in 2012 - 13 compared to568 in the year to april			0
mrs @entity126 said : ‘ this data shows that @entity2 is making @entity35 ’s promise to increase patient access to innovative radiotherapy into a farce			0
in contrast to his promise to save more lives , @entity2 is simply letting patients die			0
’ mr @entity7 is holding an event in the @entity141 today to try to persuade the government to act			0
@entity81 currently ranks third from bottom in the @entity145 league table of cancer survival rates			0
the sportsman , who won the rugby union @entity148 in 2003 , has become a charity campaigner and raised millions of pounds since launching the @entity150 following his mother ’s death			1
dr @entity153 , @entity2 ’s @entity154 , last night said : ‘ if money were no object it would be great to fund every experimental treatment that we are lobbied on , but that ’s not the reality , so instead our priority this year has been investing hundreds of millions of pounds in cancer and other specialised treatments that are actually proven to work for patients			1
