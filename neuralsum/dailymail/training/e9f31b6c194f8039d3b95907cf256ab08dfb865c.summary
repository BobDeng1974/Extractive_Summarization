by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 09:27 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:53 est , 19 december 2013 two of the most successful food brands in recent years are to part company , as @entity7 announced it is to stop stocking @entity8 early next year			2
as @entity7 moves towards more organic and gmo - free produce , it has decided to no longer offer the popular @entity12 yogurt			1
with more organic versions now available , @entity8 , which uses milk from cows fed with gmo food , appears to be less in line with the store 's philosophy			2
fresh approach : @entity7 says it will no longer stock @entity8 as it moves towards more organic @entity12 yogurt options ' @entity7 challenged its @entity12 yogurt suppliers to create unique options for shoppers to enjoy - including exclusive flavors , non-gmo options and organic choices , ' the store said in a statement			1
it added that @entity8 , which produces 30 million cups of yogurt a week , had ' chosen a different business model ' meaning it will be phased out early next year ' to make room for product choices that are n't readily available '			0
@entity37 , a @entity38 analyst , told @entity39 : ' as consumers spend more money with a handful of retailers , these retailers have more leverage to lean on suppliers for lower prices , different packaging			0
this may be one such example			0
' being stocked by @entity7 was just part of @entity8 's success story as the company , founded by a @entity55 immigrant , quickly rose to become a billion - dollar industry			1
' they have been a wonderful and an important partner of ours over the years , ' the company , run by @entity58 , said			0
taste of success : @entity8 was started by a @entity55 immigrant in 2005 who wanted to offer nutritious and easily accessible yogurt ' as the number one @entity12 yogurt brand in @entity69 using only natural ingredients , we share an affinity with @entity7 and its shoppers , ' the statement said			1
while none of the non-dairy ingredients in @entity8 have been genetically modified , it is hard for the company , and others like it , to find animal feed that is gmo free			1
in july the company said it would be a challenge to find an economical and gmo - free way to feed the more than 78,000 cows kept at 875 farms around its plants			1
more than 90 per cent of the soy and corn grown in the @entity69 and used for animal feeds come from genetically engineered seeds			0
however , with @entity8 keen for its product to be available to the masses , being dropped by @entity7 , which has about 360 stores in the @entity69 and @entity94 , wo n't be too big a set back			0
mr @entity58 told the @entity96 : ' the foundation of my business model and my philosophy is that we are going to make yogurt that is delicious , nutritious and accessible to everyone			0
' the immigrant , who came up with the idea of @entity8 in 2005 , added : ' when i came here i couldnâ € ™ t understand why in order to find good - tasting yogurt you have to go to some specialty store to find it			2

*grocery* chain says it wants *customers* to have more gmo - free options
move unlikely to affect billion - dollar success of popular @entity12 yogurt company
