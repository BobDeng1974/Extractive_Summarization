by @entity0 and @entity1 treasurer @entity2 and @entity4 leader @entity3 have become unlikely allies after both spoke up to support senator - elect @entity8 's shaky interview on sunday night			1
the @entity11 senator - elect was the subject of ridicule following an excruciating weekend interview with @entity16 's @entity15 , in which he struggled to explain his alliance with the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			1
' yes , it 's the potential if , aah , say in this case @entity21 and the @entity4 , um , it 's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances , ' mr @entity8 said in the interview			1
but mr @entity2 - not known for mincing his words - and @entity42 both said the novice politician should n't be judged on the interview			1
' you 've got to treat everyone with the same degree of respect , whether they 're the most articulate or whether they 're inarticulate , whether they 're nervous or whether they 're confident , ' mr @entity2 said on tuesday			2
' i do n't mind someone being nervous			0
i think it 's very human			0
' @entity56 : do you understand what balance of power means ? @entity8 : yes			2
it 's the potential if ... ah , let 's say in this case @entity21 and the @entity4 , um. it 's the power to vote down legislation in the right @entity66 answer : a balance of power ( in reference to the @entity69 ) is a position held by a minor party , independent or coalition which means their vote is necessary for legislation to be passed			0
mw : i do n't know what you mean by [ aftermarket industry ] ? @entity80 : the aftermarket industry is the industry , um , that is ... [ to himself ] take a breath			0
can i go out for a minute ? correct answer : the aftermarket automotive industry deals with car parts that are sold to consumers other than vehicle manufacturers ( such as @entity91 or @entity92 )			0
aftermarket manufacturers make motor vehicle parts - such as tyres , seats , engines , batteries or brake pads - and sell to car repair shops or directly to consumers			0
the products are used to replace faulty parts , to modify cars or to maintain the performance of vehicles			0
and he thinks mr @entity8 could follow in the footsteps of former member for @entity112 ' silent @entity110 '			2
' as @entity113 said at a famous town hall meeting at @entity112 , he said : " i 'm the one that does the talking , and @entity110 does the voting "			0
and i suspect it might be the same with @entity8 , ' mr @entity2 said			2
senator @entity3 said mr @entity8 's election was simply down to ' a numbers game ' but said he deserved sympathy over the interview , which caused some to question how he would represent @entity124 in the upper house			1
' it 's a nerve - wracking time when you go into politics and so , to that extent , of course you have to feel sorry for people who are struggling with it , ' senator @entity3 told reporters in @entity134			1
the bigger question was how mr @entity8 got elected with half of one per cent of the primary in the 2013 @entity139 senate race , senator @entity3 said			1
the long - serving @entity141 senator said @entity18 leader @entity142 , who mr @entity8 will back in a balance - of - power bloc when he begins his six - year term from july , and micro-parties consultant @entity145 , who guided the @entity146 on preference deals , had questions to answer about his election			1
' what you can see is a numbers game going on , ' senator @entity3 said			2
she said mr @entity8 had put himself forward for election and now had to represent his state as best he could			2
the @entity156 senator struggled to answer questions about the automobile industry ' everybody who goes into the senate has to undertake to make a serious contribution and i presume that is his commitment to the @entity37 community , ' she said			1
mr @entity2 in particular might be reluctant to go too hard on mr @entity8 after his boss made a verbal gaffe of his own over the weekend			1
prime minister @entity168 immediately corrected himself after referring to ' @entity169 ' during an official trip , but audiences back home noted the slip and ' @entity169 ' was soon trending on @entity174			0
mr @entity8 , from the @entity156 , struggled to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the @entity69 veteran seven reporter @entity56 asked mr @entity8 to explain what he meant by the ' aftermarket ' automobile industry , but the @entity124 stumbled with his answer before taking a break			1
' there 's the aftermarket industry which can be supported ... people that are losing their jobs ... sorry ... can we start that question again ? ' mr @entity8 said			1
' there 's the aftermarket industry ... which ... um ... sorry , can we go to another question ? i 've got myself into a fluster			0
' the aftermarket industry is the industry that is ... can i go out for a minute ? ' after a short break , mr @entity8 returns , and mr @entity56 advises him to answer questions as if he 's talking to someone at a pub. mr @entity8 , who has maintained his job at a timber mill ahead of the move to @entity204 , also struggles to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the @entity69			1
' yes , it 's the potential if , aah , say in this case @entity21 and the @entity4 , umm , it 's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances , ' he said			0
@entity18 leader and businessman @entity142 on monday attacked the @entity216 's story as ' biased and churlish '			0
' @entity56 recorded about an hour of a really serious interview with me about political things and other things but he did n't show any of that , ' he told @entity222			0
' he does n't show you all of the footage			0

@entity2 and @entity227 , @entity3 , defended mr @entity8 's blundering interview with @entity16 on sunday
they said he deserved sympathy over the nerve - wracking interview
