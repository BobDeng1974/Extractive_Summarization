@entity0 fears ' a very painful year ' lies ahead if @entity2 's roll out of their upgraded car this season proves a dud			1
build - time pressure over the winter resulted in the @entity9 - based marque starting the campaign with a car that is considerably off the pace			2
the additional knock - on effect means a delay in the introduction of the team 's b - spec model , which is now not due to be unveiled until the @entity19 @entity18 in june			2
@entity0 walks through the paddock in @entity21 ahead of sunday 's @entity22 @entity18 @entity0 locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the @entity26 @entity18 in march the hope is @entity0 and team - mate @entity28 will then finally be able to compete for points finishes , rather than crossing fingers a top - 10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals			1
if performance is lacking , however , @entity0 fears the worst			1
' we 're hoping to make a big step forward , ' said @entity0			1
' if we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining , a lot of time to recover			2
' but if we do n't make the step we 're hoping for then it 's going to be a very painful year			1
' for the team and the @entity46 , who was 10th in the season - opening race in @entity26 - where only 15 started and 11 finished - and 13th in @entity50 recently , the current struggles are already tough to endure			1
@entity0 fears for @entity2 's pace and was hounded by the equally troubled @entity53 duo of @entity54 and @entity55 in the @entity56 near the back of the grid @entity0 finished 13th at @entity59 and admits @entity2 are relying on their june upgrade to come good ' it is frustrating knowing we do n't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace			1
it 's really hard , ' @entity0 added			2
' it is also really hard to keep motivated			0
going into a race , knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage , is not the easiest for a driver			0
' at the moment , on pure pace , it is quite difficult to make it into the points			0
we 're quite far from the teams ahead of us			0
' we are in a position where it 's very easy to make mistakes , to lose the car as it is very difficult with degradation and stuff			0
' from now on we are going to have hard races , but it is what it is at the moment			0
we have to be professional and do the job as if we are going to win the race			0
' we 're going to give 100 per cent and try to be there with whatever we have , to try to get into the points before we get the new package that can hopefully get us back into the points on pure pace			0

@entity0 admits @entity2 are relying on june upgrade to *improve*
@entity46 fears very painful year if upgrade fails to raise competitiveness
@entity2 missed much of *pre-season* testing and are well off the pace
