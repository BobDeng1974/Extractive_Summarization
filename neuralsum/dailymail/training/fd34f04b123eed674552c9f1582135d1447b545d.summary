by @entity0 as @entity1 mourns the victims of flight mh370 - which included 38 @entity1 - the nation 's queen was photographed enjoying a round of golf			1
her majesty the @entity8 , @entity10 of @entity1 , laughed heartily at @entity11 & @entity12 in @entity13 on wednesday during a pro-am event prior to the @entity15			1
the pictures emerged as search teams from several nations continued to scour the southern @entity19 for debris from the ill - fated @entity22 plane in a bid to bring the relatives of the passengers some closure			2
sheer joy : her majesty @entity30 , @entity10 of @entity1 , looks happy and carefree as @entity1 endures some of its darkest days tragic days : pictures of the @entity10 enjoying herself on the golf course came as search teams continued to scour the oceans for @entity36 's wreckage new satellite images have revealed 122 objects in the southern @entity19 that could be debris from the @entity1 jetliner , missing since march 8 with 239 people on board , @entity1 's acting transport minister said on wednesday			1
the find has dramatically narrowed the search zone , with the debris spotted across an area measuring just 155 square miles ( 400 square kilometres )			0
in the past few days the search area has measured around 622,000 square miles - six times the size of the @entity50			0
on wednesday around 31,000 square miles was scoured			0
delight : the queen of @entity1 and @entity54 , the @entity55 captain , on the first tee during the pro-am event concentration : @entity10 of @entity1 watches her shot on the second hole grief stricken : a relative of the @entity65 passengers aboard the @entity36 flight grieves after being told that the missing plane might have crashed into the southern @entity19 @entity68 told a news conference that the images were captured by @entity72 - based @entity71 on march 23			1
they are the fourth set of satellite images to show potential debris from @entity36 in a remote part of the @entity19 roughly 2,500 km ( 1,550 miles ) south west of @entity78			1
the objects are believed to be solid and range from one metre to 23 metres ( three to 75 feet ) long			0
it is understood some pieces of debris are ' bright ' but authorities have not confirmed whether they are from missing @entity36			2
anguish : relatives of the passengers have been tortured by a lack of concrete information about the fate of @entity36 @entity36 vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from @entity13 bound for @entity91 , and investigators believe someone on the flight may have shut off the plane 's communications systems			1
partial military radar tracking showed it turning west and recrossing the @entity99 , apparently under the control of a skilled pilot			0
@entity1 's air force has released few details of its radar tracking beyond saying the plane was last detected off the northwest coast heading towards @entity107			1
but the country 's deputy defence minister , @entity109 , told parliament that no action was taken when the unidentified plane was spotted because it was assumed it had been ordered to turn back , local media said			2
' it was detected by our radar , but the turn back was by a non-hostile plane and we thought maybe it was at the directive of the control tower , ' he was quoted as saying			0
asked at the news conference whether air force radar operators thought the plane had been told to turn back by air traffic controllers , @entity125 , who is also defence minister , said he could not confirm it			0
a dozen aircraft from @entity130 , the @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity65 , @entity133 and @entity134 were once more scouring the seas southwest of @entity78 in the hunt for wreckage on wednesday , after bad weather the previous day forced the suspension of the search			0
but the area is renowned among mariners for high winds and big waves and the good weather is unlikely to last			0
‘ this is only going to be a narrow window of opportunity by the looks of things , because another weather system is moving in for thursday , which looks like that will bring an increase in winds again and also lead to a reduction in visibility through the rain associated with the cold front , ’ @entity146 , a spokesman for @entity130 's @entity147 , told @entity148			2
@entity1 prime minister @entity162 this week confirmed @entity36 had crashed in the southern @entity19 .			1
