@entity0 is planning a visit to watch the @entity3 golf tournament within days of breaking up the 300 - year - old @entity4			1
the @entity6 first minister revealed that if he secures victory in his battle for independence , he will travel to @entity10 to watch the likes of @entity12 and @entity13 teeing off			1
after dire warnings that @entity17 vote could trigger economic catastrophe , no campaigners accused mr @entity0 of embarking on a ' premature victory lap ' instead of answering key questions about how independence would work in practice			1
first minister @entity0 , pictured watching the @entity3 in @entity23 in 2012 , has admitted he plans a day out at the tournament at @entity10 just days after the independence referendum mr @entity0 , a keen golfer , suggested that whatever the outcome of the referendum on september 18 he will not miss the @entity3 , which starts just five days later at the @entity10 in @entity28			1
he also insisted that he will abide by the result , and if @entity6 vote no there will not be another referendum on independence for a generation			1
but the revelation that his mind is on golf will draw comparisons with @entity38 and his reputation for being a ' chillaxing ' prime minister			1
mr @entity0 today appeared on @entity42 's @entity41 to set out his latest pitch for independence			1
he insisted that if he loses thursday 's vote , he will not try to force another referendum			2
' if you remember previous constitutional referenda in @entity6 , there was one in 1979 and the next one was 1997			2
mr @entity0 's wife @entity51 has reportedly encouraged him to play golf during the independence campaign to help clear his head ' that 's what i mean by a political generation … this is a once in a generation , perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for @entity6			1
' in the interview mr @entity63 asked mr @entity0 about the prospect of voters backing independence , ' you presumably have a malt , a round of golf and then what happens ? ' extraordinarily , mr @entity0 said : ' i 'll probably go to the @entity3 the following week , i 'm not sure about the malt			1
' mr @entity0 's wife @entity72 is reportedly credited with encouraging the first minister to regularly take time out from the referendum campaign to play golf to ' unwind and clear his head ' , according to the @entity77			1
it also emerged that mr @entity0 was playing against the 14 - year - old son of the greenkeeper at @entity82 golf course overlooking the @entity83 when news broke of an opinion poll putting the @entity17 campaign ahead last weekend			1
today mr @entity0 went on to insist that there will be ' urgent business following a yes victory on friday ' , adding : ' firstly i think it will be a day of celebration , @entity6 will have achieved something astonishing in democratic politics			1
' but there 's a lot of business to do			0
and the first and urgent business is to bring @entity6 together			2
' because on friday , after a @entity17 vote there 'll cease to be a @entity17 campaign and a no campaign			0
there 'll be a @entity104			0
and i 've said very clearly that i want into that @entity104 as many voices as possible , people who have got something to offer and contribute to bring the country together			0
' but @entity110 , leader of the @entity112 campaign , accused mr @entity0 of doing a ' premature victory lap ' ahead of polling day			0
he told the @entity42 : ' we still do n't know how we can ensure that we do n't lose jobs , with firms saying they are going to take their headquarters out of @entity6 – that would be a disaster for @entity6			0
' we still do n't know how we are going to replace the additional funding we get for the @entity121			0
' we do n't know who is going to pay pensions and you were asking @entity0 a few moments ago about currency and he seemed to be doing a rather premature victory lap even before most of us have voted			0
' but he was just simply asserting that low and behold on friday morning , everybody else is wrong , they are all going to fall in line with what he is going to say			0
' mr @entity0 has previously faced criticism for spending £ 7,000 of taxpayers ' money on a visit to @entity136 for the @entity3 in 2012			2
he stayed in a suite in the five - star @entity138 , popular with celebrities such as @entity141 , which included a guest powder room , living room , a dressing area , three tvs , a video games console , a surround - sound stereo system and a marble bathroom			0
better together leader @entity110 accused mr @entity0 of being on a ' premature victory lap ' instead of answering questions about what independence would mean in practice mr @entity0 would have been treated to panoramic views of @entity156 , one of @entity136 's main thoroughfares , and the city 's historic @entity159			2
the @entity162 leader , who was accompanied by three officials , has refused to disclose how much he spent on this weeklong jaunt , dismissing criticism as ' ridiculous frippery '			0
but the majority of the ' @entity104 ' delegation in the @entity169 at the same time stayed in a more modest hotel near the @entity173 golf course , which charges £ 60 for a room			0
the entire trip cost taxpayers nearly £ 500,000			0
@entity38 decided against spending the weekend campaigning in @entity6 to instead attend a society wedding in @entity177 with the clock ticking on the countdown to the crunch vote on the future of the @entity4 , mr @entity38 chose not to spend the weekend in @entity6 and yesterday attended a society wedding south of the border			1
the @entity184 mingled with well - heeled guests in the @entity177 village of @entity187 , where @entity189 's half - brother @entity188 married @entity190			2
the younger son of @entity192 and his wife @entity193 , 33 - year - old @entity188 is an @entity194 who studied at @entity196 and works as a @entity198 - speaking investment analyst , while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand			0
the couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in @entity203 two days ago , laid on by the prime minister 's wife			1
they are part of the aristocratic @entity188 family , descended from the 19th century fur trader and @entity169 's first multi-millionaire @entity210			0
yesterday 's wedding came just weeks after mr @entity38 faced criticism for returning to the @entity214 surf hours after a crisis meeting about a @entity218 jihadi beheading journalist @entity216 .			2
