by @entity0 published : 15:48 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 15:51 est , 15 june 2013 the only surviving @entity3 @entity2 bomber has arrived at an @entity5 museum for a restoration project after spending more than 70 years at the bottom of the @entity8			1
the badly - damaged @entity10 aircraft was transported more than 200 miles from @entity11 to @entity12 in @entity13 today , escorted by two low loader lorries			0
it was lifted from the seabed on the @entity18 coastline last week where it was shot down during the @entity20			1
the world 's last surviving @entity23 , arriving at the @entity24 at @entity12 in @entity13 the badly - damaged @entity3 bomber was transported from the @entity18 coast near @entity11 , @entity18 for the first stage of its conservation the fragile fuselage and wings were unloaded by crane to go into hydration tunnels , where it will stay for the first stage of its conservation the painstaking project is believed to be the biggest ever recovery of its kind in @entity41 waters			1
the aircraft will be kept in purpose - built hydration tunnels at @entity12 , where it will stay for the first stage of its conservation			0
@entity46 , general manager at @entity47 , told the @entity48 : ' after all the hard work , planning and setbacks , it 's great to know the @entity53 is finally here at @entity12			2
' it will be a rare and exciting opportunity for visitors to get up close and personal to a unique piece of aviation history and the chance to view it in its salvaged state			0
' conservationist @entity62 started work immediately hosing down the bomber as museum staff were thrilled to see the plane finally arrive the aircraft serial number plate of the bomber shows a vivid piece of @entity10 history the plan to raise the plane - three years in the making - involved attaching lifting equipment to the strongest parts of the aircraft 's frame and raising it whole in a single lift on june 10			1
the ambitious hour - long operation was endlessly delayed by strong winds for weeks on end , until finally good weather made the salvage possible			0
the existence of the aircraft at @entity86 became known when it was spotted by casual divers in 2008 at a depth of 50ft , lying on a chalk bed surrounded by debris			1
the aircraft landing on a barge on june 10 after weeks of strong winds delayed the painstaking operation a sea water damaged engine part of the bomber shot down at the height of the @entity20 by @entity5 's @entity100 fighters the salvage crew lifting the plane from the @entity86 sea bed sonar scans by the @entity24 , @entity105 and the @entity106 confirmed the identity of the aircraft			1
judging by the serial number on the aircraft it was shot down on august 26 , 1940 , at the height of the @entity20			1
it was nicknamed the @entity114 's ' flying pencil ' because of its narrow fuselage			2
around 1,500 models of the aircraft were built , but this one is the last remaining			0
originally it would have been camouflaged green and dark green on top with swastikas outlined in white on both rudders			0
the @entity53 's bombs devastated large areas of @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 as one of the @entity114 's most important assets in the early phase of @entity10			2
historians believe this particular plane took off on the morning of august 26 , with eight other @entity53 bombers from @entity137 in @entity3 - occupied @entity138 to bomb the @entity5 fighter base @entity140 in @entity18			1
the @entity114 lost three of its dorniers that day , including this one			0
after an attempted controlled landing , the plane somersaulted and landed on its back			0
all four crew managed to leave the aircraft			0
these @entity3 @entity2 aircraft flying over @entity147 were similar to the one found near the @entity18 coast the image that showed archaelogists that divers had indeed discovered the rare bomber wireless operator @entity153 and @entity155 died and their bodies were washed up in @entity158 and @entity159 , repectively where they were buried in war cemeteries			1
the other two crew members , pilot @entity163 and @entity164 survived and spent the rest of the war in @entity41 prisoner - of - war camps			1
experts are excited by the find because , apart from the effects of sea life - such as barnacles , coral and marine life , it is largely intact			0
amazingly the main undercarriage tyres remain inflated , although the propellers clearly show the damage inflicted during the bomber 's fateful final landing			2
once the delicate process of conservation is complete , the aircraft will be displayed at the museum 's @entity128 site within the context of the @entity20 story			2
the bomber was retrieved from @entity86 , off the @entity18 coast			0

only surviving @entity3 bomber of its kind begins its restoration
it was lifted from @entity8 where it was shot down in @entity20
two crew members died and the other two became prisoners of war
*incredibly* , the plane 's wheels were still inflated after 70 years on the seabed
it was first discovered by casual divers in 2008
