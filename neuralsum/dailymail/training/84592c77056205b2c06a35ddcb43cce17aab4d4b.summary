in the weeks following liberation from the @entity2 , @entity0 was hit by wave of crime and violence that saw the city compared to @entity8 @entity7 or @entity9			1
and the cause was the same : @entity11			2
while the @entity13 fought against @entity15 ’s forces in @entity16 , law enforcers fought against the criminals who threatened that victory			1
men who had abandoned the ' greater good ' in favour of self - interest , black - market profits and the lure of the cafes and brothels of @entity0 : deserters			1
@entity26 welcomed their @entity28 liberators in 1944 but soon the city 's streets were flooded with a new kind of violence the existence of these gangs is one of many revelations in a compelling new book , ' the deserters : a @entity38 ' @entity40 's study of the very different stories and men grouped together under the label , deserters highly organised , armed to the teeth and merciless , these deserters used their @entity48 uniforms as another tool of their trade along with the vast arrays of stolen weapons , forged passes and hijacked vehicles they had at their disposal			1
between june 1944 and april 1945 the @entity48 army ’s @entity57 ( @entity59 ) handled a total of 7,912 cases			1
forty per cent involved misappropriation of @entity48 supplies			1
@entity64 yet was the proportion of crimes of violence – rape , murder , manslaughter and assault which accounted for 44 per cent of the force ’s workload			1
the remaining 12 per cent were crimes such as robbery , housebreaking and riot			2
former chief @entity80 correspondent for @entity82 , the book 's author @entity40 had long harboured an interest in the subject			1
but it was only truly ignited by a chance meeting with @entity88 - decorated combat veteran of the @entity89 and former deserter			1
@entity40 was giving a talk to publicise his previous book , ' @entity48 in @entity0 : @entity93 under @entity94 ' when the @entity48 started asking questions			1
it was clear , @entity40 recounts , that the questioner 's knowledge of the @entity99 was more intimate than his own			1
private first class @entity88 pictured in @entity0 on @entity101 , november , 11 , 1945			1
his complex story of courage and desertion inspired author @entity40 tested beyond endurance : this official @entity107 photograph taken in @entity108 near @entity109 in august 1944 , captured private first class @entity88 boarding a @entity111 landing craft			1
he is climbing the gangplank on the right - hand side of the photograph			1
the @entity114 , a @entity115 by @entity40 hero or @entity117 ? @entity88 receives the @entity118 in july 1946 yet 2 years earlier the @entity48 army jailed him as a deserter they met for coffee and @entity88 asked @entity40 what he was working on			1
@entity40 recalls : ' i told him it was a book on @entity48 and @entity111 deserters in the @entity127 and asked if he knew anything about it			1
' he answered , " i was a deserter			2
" ' this once idealistic boy from @entity131 who enlisted at 17 , had fought on the beachhead at @entity133 and through the perilous @entity134 , he was one of the very few regular @entity48 soldiers to fight with the @entity136 in 1944			1
his story was , @entity40 realised , both secret and emblematic of a group of men , wreathed together under a banner of shame that branded them cowards			2
yet the truth was far more complex			1
they had reached a point beyond which they could not endure and chosen disgrace over the grave			2
some recounted waking , as if from a dream , to find their bodies had led them away from the battelfield			2
others , like @entity88 , fought until their faith in their immediate commanders disappeared			2
was it a form of madness or a dawning lucidity that led them to desert ? @entity40 does not claim to be able to answer that question to which @entity88 himself had devoted his latter years to addressing to no avail			0
others still deserted to make money , stealing and selling the military supplies that their comrades at the front needed to survive			1
opportunists and crooks , certainly , but not cowards - the life they chose was every bit as violent and bloody as battle			1
50,000 @entity48 and 100,000 @entity111 soldiers deserted during @entity127 yet according to @entity40 the astounding fact is not that so many men deserted , but that so few did			1
only one was executed for it , @entity178			2
he was , until that point , by his own assessment the unluckiest man alive			2
the @entity181 : @entity178 , left , was the only @entity48 executed for desertion as his trial fell at a time when general @entity185 , right , decided he could not risk appearing lenient on the crime he never fought a battle			1
he never went on the run as most deserters did			2
he simply made it clear that he preferred prison to battle			0
of the 49 @entity48 sentenced to death for desertion during the @entity127 he was the only one whose appeal for commutation was rejected			1
his greatest sin , as @entity40 tells it , was his timing			0
his appeal came in january 1945 just as the @entity202 counter-offensive , the @entity200 , was at its peak			0
allied forces were near breaking point			0
it was not , @entity207 , general @entity185 decided , time to risk seeming to condone desertion			0
@entity178 was shot for his crime on the morning of 31 january 1945			2
he was dispatched in the remote @entity211 village of @entity212 and the truth concealed even from his wife , @entity214			1
she was informed that her husband had died in the @entity217			0
his identity was ultimately revealed in 1954 and twenty years later @entity219 played him in the television film , @entity221			0
in it @entity219 recites the words @entity178 spoke before the firing squad shot him			1
‘ they ’re not shooting me for deserting the @entity107 , ’ he said			1
last stand : @entity219 played @entity178 in @entity228 film , the execution of @entity178 @entity231 's execution in @entity211 was kept a secret from his wife and his identity only emerged in 1954 @entity178 and his wife @entity214 on their wedding day in @entity238			1
he was executed on 31 january 1948 ‘ they just need to make an example out of somebody and i ’m it because i ’m an ex-con			2
' i used to steal things when i was a kid , and that ’s what they are shooting me for			0
' they ’re shooting me for the bread and chewing gum i stole when i was 12 years old			0
’ private @entity251 's was a very different story			2
he was a farm boy from @entity253 who rushed to join up to escape a life of brutalising poverty and violence at the hands of his stepfather			2
he ended up a gangster tearing through @entity0			1
@entity251 fought at @entity261 and claims to have stormed the beaches on the d - day landings			2
he considered himself a battle - hardened professional soldier and bit by bit the small reserve of mercy that had survived his childhood evaporated in the heat of war			2
he had been in continuous combat with them from d - day to 30th december 1944			2
he had earned the @entity276 , two @entity277 , @entity278 and @entity279			0
when he was invalided out to @entity0 with appendicitis and assumed that he would rejoin his unit , the @entity282 , on his recovery			1
instead he was sent to the @entity284 , a replacement depot in @entity286			0
when a young lieutenant presented @entity251 with a @entity289 vintage rifle for guard duty , he told the officer to take the ‘ peashooter ’ and ‘ shove it up his ass			0
’ loyalties lost : before deserting @entity251 was decorated for bravery he has identified himself as the third soldier on the right , visible in profile , at the front of this @entity275 landing craft approaching @entity261 6 june 1944 @entity88 , left , pictured with author @entity40 in @entity0 where he was court martialled for desertion			1
he was 19 and thought his life was over			0
he demanded the weapons he was used to – a .45 pistol , a @entity308 sub-machine gun and a trench knife			0
his actual desertion was unspectacular			0
@entity251 was looking for a drink			0
the @entity312 refused him entrance because he did n’t have a pass and so he wandered on ‘ in search of a bed in a brothel			0
by morning he was officially awol			0
the next day a waitress in a café took pity on him and added fried eggs and potatoes to his order of soup and bread			0
when @entity326 came in and started asking questions she gave @entity251 the key to her room in a cheap hotel and told him to wait for her there			0
from decorated soldier he moved seamlessly into life as a criminal in the @entity0 underworld			1
a chance meeting led to him taking his place as a member of one of the many gangs of ex-soldiers terrorizing @entity0			1
led by an ex-paratrooper sergeant , raids were planned like military operations			0
@entity251 himself admitted , ‘ we stole trucks , sold whatever they carried , and used the trucks to rob warehouses of the goods in them			0
’ they used combat tactics , hijacked goods destined for front - line troops			1
their crimes even spread into @entity361			0
they attacked civilians and military targets indiscriminately			0
his gangland activities gave @entity251 ‘ a bigger thrill than battle			0
’ quoting from the former soldier ’s memoir glass recounts his boasts : ‘ we robbed every café in @entity0 , in all sectors except our own , while the gendarmes went crazy			1
’ they robbed crates of cognac and champagne , hijacked jeeps and raided private houses whose bed sheets and radios were ‘ easy to fence			0
’ they stole petrol , cigarettes , liquor and @entity388 six months @entity251 reckoned his share of the plunder at $ 100,000			0
little wonder that when victory in @entity16 was announced on 7 may 1945 , @entity251 admitted , ‘ that day and night everyone in @entity0 and the rest of @entity16 was celebrating , but i just stayed in my apartment thinking about it all			1
’ because @entity399 ’s desertion did not end his war – it was a part of it			0
as it was a part of many soldiers ’ wars that has long gone unrecorded			0
ultimately @entity251 was captured and court martialled			0
he was dishonourably discharged and spent time in the @entity407 in the south of @entity211 and in federal penitentiaries in @entity410			0
many years later he had that ‘ dishonourable discharge , ’ turned into a general one on rather disingenuous legal grounds			0
in peacetime appearances mattered more to @entity251 than they ever had in war			0
back then , he admitted : ‘ i never knew what tomorrow would hold , so i took every day as it came			0
@entity127 does strange things to people , especially their morality			0
’ those ‘ strange things ’ rather than the false extremes of courage and cowardice are the truths set out in this account of the @entity127 and its deserters			2
the @entity114 : a @entity427 by @entity40 is published by @entity428 , 13 june , @entity429 $ 27.95			1
available on @entity430 by clicking here .			0

@entity114 in league with the @entity0 underworld brought an *unprecedented* crime - wave to post liberation @entity0
50,000 @entity48 troops deserted , 49 were sentenced to death but only one went before the firing squad
new book reveals how the @entity107 concealed the truth even from the executed man 's wife
@entity8 style violence from @entity48 deserters threatened to derail the fight against @entity15 in @entity16
