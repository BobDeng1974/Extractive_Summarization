@entity1 coach @entity0 is keeping his faith with out - of - form @entity3 despite the opener 's lack of runs			1
@entity8 's 26 against @entity9 in their last @entity11 pool game was his highest score in his last seven one - day internationals , a run that followed his century against @entity16 in november			1
the difficult patch , including five single - figure scores , is a far cry from @entity8 's early career form , which once saw him score three straight centuries against @entity22 in december 2013			1
@entity3 looks to the skies in dejection after being caught out against the @entity9 for 26 runs the out - of - form opener leaves the field after being dismissed against @entity28 for a duck while @entity30 and @entity31 currently lead the run charts for the @entity33 , ahead of their quarter - final against @entity36 on wednesday at @entity37 , @entity0 is confident @entity8 is closer than ever to a match - winning innings			1
when asked if @entity8 was facing a mental barrier , @entity0 told a press conference : ' i am not a sports psychologist but i do n't know how a player can be perceived to be mentally shot			2
it 's a little bit nasty			0
' it 's going to be a tough selection ( meeting )			0
on the one hand we know @entity3 has got the ability to win games			0
but it 's often difficult to have all six batters in form at the same time			0
' we just sort of have this gut feeling that @entity3 has got a big score around the corner			2
he 's done well against @entity36			2
i 'm sure he 'll have a good feeling playing against @entity36			0
' one player @entity8 can look up to outside of his own dressing room is @entity63 , with the @entity64 currently leading the @entity11 run - scoring charts at 496 - he has four successive centuries to boot and is fighting for the number one ranking with @entity30			1
@entity8 is set to continue at the top of the @entity1 batting order for the quarter - final against @entity36 @entity1 coach @entity0 believes @entity8 is due a big score for @entity0 , though , the law of averages again is a handy way to look at things , as he added : ' he 's in the form of his life			1
you 've got to think his low score is just round the corner i suppose			0
' but we have worked on some plans that we feel we need to execute well against him			0
' and while @entity1 hope they have ' learned from the lessons ' of past sides , @entity36 are getting political in their approach to the knockout stage			2
no less than @entity36 's president and prime minister have offered their vocal support , with the latter unsurprisingly keen to claim his successful election campaign from january as the benchmark for aiming high			0
in quotes paraphrased in a statement on @entity36 cricket 's website , prime minister @entity98 stressed on the need to study @entity1 's weaknesses , adding : ' that 's what some of us did last december			1

@entity1 play @entity36 in the @entity11 quarter - final on wednesday
@entity3 's 26 against @entity9 was his highest score in seven @entity112
coach @entity0 is keeping faith with his out - of - form opener
