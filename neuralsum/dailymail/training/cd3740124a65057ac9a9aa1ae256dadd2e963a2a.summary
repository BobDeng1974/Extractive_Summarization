click here for all the stats from @entity2			1
luckily , @entity3 already has enough happy @entity2 memories to last him a lifetime			1
because on sunday , returning to @entity8 , his @entity7 team were destroyed in a wholly one - sided encounter			1
it was a day of intriguing sub-plots , @entity8 manager @entity13 ’s first home game , @entity14 and @entity15 making their @entity7 debuts , while former coach @entity17 also made his return to @entity2 after his summer departure following @entity21 ’s sacking — as guest of @entity7 chairman @entity23			1
but the most interesting storyline was @entity3 ’s return			1
there was no fairytale ending though , only misery , as he watched his team — and their new 3 - 5 - 2 formation — blown away			0
‘ a disappointing day , very disappointing , ’ admitted @entity3			2
‘ we started poorly and did n’t get out of it			0
we looked a little bit like a team of strangers			0
‘ it does n’t hurt more because it ’s @entity8 , it ’s three points			2
that ’s all that matters to me			0
getting beat here is no different to getting beat anywhere else			0
’ @entity3 will have left knowing that under @entity13 , this current @entity8 team have the potential to recreate the free - flowing winning football that became a feature of his four - year @entity8 reign			1
following @entity21 ’s dismissal , chairman @entity124 entrusted @entity13 with the task of bringing flair back to @entity2			2
and , @entity8 showed tangible evidence the @entity129 is heading in the right direction			2
‘ at the moment we want to put in place our philosophy and try always to convince we can play in the way @entity8 played in their history , ’ said @entity13			2
‘ but it ’s important to keep the reality and stay calm because if you lose two games , you are in danger			0
‘ it ’s always better when you win			0
it ’s easier to develop your style and philosophy when you win			0
we are top of the table but it ’s nothing because it ’s two games in			0
’ same again : @entity65 ( right ) finishes off a slick passing move from the home side with a powerful header to put @entity8 3 - 0 ahead in their first home game of the season too hot to handle : @entity7 goalkeeper @entity74 ca n't keep out @entity34 's header despite getting his fingertips to the ball familiar sight : @entity65 wheels away to celebrate his second goal of the afternoon for @entity8 as striker @entity67 ( right ) chases after him and another one : @entity67 gets in on the act by scoring @entity8 's fourth goal of the day past @entity7 goalkeeper @entity74 centre of attention : @entity67 is mobbed by his team - mates @entity40 ( left ) and @entity65 ( right ) after grabbing his first goal of the @entity168 season @entity8 's third goal came through @entity34 after an intricate passing move from @entity13 's side - click here for more in our brilliant @entity172 @entity8 's 48 - pass move that led to @entity34 ’s second goal was twice as long as any @entity168 goal scored in 2013 - 14			1
@entity177 had at least one touch @entity64 14 @entity179 10 @entity180 6 @entity59 4 @entity40 3 @entity181 3 @entity34 2 @entity182 2 @entity67 2 @entity56 1 @entity58 1 for @entity7 , the signs were ominous from the outset , @entity8 dominating possession ; @entity13 ’s high - pressing style already having a clear influence			1
it took 12 minutes for @entity8 to open the scoring , @entity34 coolly finishing at the back post after @entity191 failed to deal with @entity67 ’s cross from the left			1
@entity194 missed an undeserved chance to equalise for the visitors on 20 minutes , firing over with just @entity58 to beat			0
@entity3 knew it was the sort of chance his side could not afford to squander , and he was right as @entity8 set about putting themselves three goals clear before half - time			1
@entity56 rattled the bar with a superbly executed 30 - yard free - kick in the 24th minute before @entity8 ’ latest hero @entity42 added to his growing reputation by scoring @entity8 ’s second , nodding home @entity40 ’s 30th - minute near - post corner after slack marking from @entity14			1
seven minutes later , @entity40 showed why @entity8 have been so keen to persevere with him despite a disappointing first season			2
he cut through @entity7 ’s shell - shocked defence before producing an inch - perfect cross to leave @entity65 with the simple job of heading past @entity213			2
after a difficult first season at @entity8 , the @entity129 showed signs of major progress			0
two first - half assists provided tangible evidence of that , but it was his body language and demeanour that was perhaps most impressive			0
@entity40 wanted the ball at every turn , not afraid to express himself — a far cry from last season ’s injury troubles			0
but how @entity34 was afforded the freedom of the penalty area to score his second will have infuriated @entity3			1
much has been made of @entity7 ’s switch to a 3 - 5 - 2 system , but no formation or tactics could account for the woeful individual defending that cost @entity7 three goals			0
television cameras at @entity2 cut to @entity8 legend @entity237 , now a @entity7 coach , sitting in the stands , furiously writing notes before the half - time break			1
on the run : @entity7 defender @entity81 ( right ) attempts to get past @entity243 ( left ) battle : two - goal hero @entity34 ( left ) challenges @entity7 defender @entity191 ( right ) , who was substituted at half - time new and old : former @entity8 boss and now manager of @entity7 @entity3 ( left ) gives out instructions as @entity13 ( right ) watches on tricky customer : @entity129 winger @entity40 ( right ) uses his pace to get away from defender @entity76 ( left ) during the opening period club record signing @entity40 roamed all over pitch as @entity8 ran riot against @entity7 , as his @entity256 below shows - click here for more in our @entity172 under pressure : @entity7 winger @entity194 ( left ) attempts to get clear of @entity8 substitute @entity63 ( right ) respect : @entity260 shakes hands with his former manager @entity3 after being replaced by @entity68 with just over 10 minutes remaining experienced : veteran defender @entity263 ( right ) attempts to shield the ball from @entity8 midfielder @entity56 ( left ) mins @entity265 @entity8 total 117.4 72.9 @entity56 12.5 7.8 @entity40 12.0 7.5 @entity64 11.6 7.2 @entity7 total 109.7 68.2 @entity79 12.1 7.5 @entity78 11.4 7.1 @entity15 10.6 6.6 data courtesy of the @entity267 , the @entity268 of the @entity168 @entity76 carried the can for @entity7 ’s defensive woes , the @entity271 substituted by @entity77 at half - time			1
but the second half was only ever going to be a damage - limitation exercise for @entity7			2
@entity8 added one more , @entity67 scoring a deserved goal after excellent work from @entity277 and @entity181			1
for @entity13 the future looks bright after three wins			0
next week , though , @entity280 will provide a clearer view of the progress made under the @entity129			0
for @entity3 , far from looking to the future , his return to @entity2 may cause him to look back in anger at this humilating defeat			1
