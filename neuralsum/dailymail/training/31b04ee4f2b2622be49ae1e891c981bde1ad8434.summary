once the largest building in @entity2 , this abandoned asylum is now no more than a labyrinth of crumbling brick walls and dusty beds			1
@entity6 was open for more than 120 years and housed more than 7,000 patients at a time including the folk singer @entity8			1
but it closed for good in 2003 , and despite a fierce campaign authorities in @entity11 will demolish the remains of its chapel , classrooms , dental clinic and power station within months			1
left to rot : once reputedly the largest building in @entity2 , @entity6 in @entity11 had more than 7,000 patients during its peak in the 1950s the doctor wo n't see you now : a therapy room lies abandoned with straps still trailing across the bed			1
the remains of the complex will be demolished within months reclaimed by nature : weeds have begun to spring up again in the condemned 19th century buildings			2
the photos were taken by urban explorer @entity32 , 31 magnificent : the grand building opened its doors in 1876 and soon expanded			1
its patients included the folk singer and @entity41 sufferer @entity8 with 678,000 square feet of space , the former ' lunatic asylum ' opened to relieve pressure on a nearby facility			1
the main building was widely said to be the largest building by footprint in the @entity2 until 1943 , when it was surpassed by the @entity50 - which has 6.5million square feet altogether			1
the @entity50 itself has long since been surpassed and @entity2 's largest building by footprint is now the @entity54 plant in @entity55 , @entity56			1
the factory opened in 2010 has the second - largest footprint in the world ( 5.5million sq ft ) , beaten only by an auction centre for flowers in the @entity62 ( 5.6million )			2
built from 1871 and opened in 1876 , the hospital originally accommodated just 600 patients but soon expanded			1
by 1880 the patient population was 800 and in 1903 the numbers reached 1,500			0
the population of the hospital reached its peak in 1953 , when millions of shell - shocked soldiers returned from the @entity71 suffering from what is now widely known as post-traumatic stress disorder			1
by then it held 7,674 patients and was a self - sufficient campus , with facilities including a laundry , chapel , dental clinic , infirmary , classrooms , therapy buildings , dormitories and even a power station			1
@entity2 folk singer @entity8 , who wrote hundreds of songs and made famous recordings of @entity88 and @entity89 , was committed in 1956 with @entity41			1
the genetic disorder had blighted the life of his mother and made it difficult for him to walk , causing wild fluctuations in mood			0
even as @entity8 was in his final years before he died in 1967 , folk revivalists were basing a new scene on @entity8 's genius in @entity100 's @entity99			2
one of his visitors in @entity102 was the undisputed king of the @entity99 scene : a 19 - year - old @entity103			0
a 19 - year - old @entity103 visited folk singer @entity8 ( left ) when he was a patient at @entity102 , where many of the chairs and tables lie abandoned ( right ) faith : the purpose - built chapel would have provided solace to those suffering from terrible illnesses in an age which understood little about them			1
but now it lies empty , with the upside - down cross of @entity117 ( often - and maybe in this case - appropriated as a symbol of satanism ) graffitied on the wall near where the altar stood magnificent : the vaulted ceiling of the chapel , which will soon be demolished in a project expected to cost $ 50million			2
the site was so large it had its own power station big questions : the way @entity132 countries treat the mentally ill has been a major debate , particular since @entity136 's 1962 novel @entity134 many western psychiatric hospitals were controversial for their use of treatments such as electric shock therapy , which was introduced at @entity102 in the early 1900s			1
@entity136 's 1962 novel @entity134 would be made into a seminal film starring @entity142 , which swept all four major @entity144 and turned @entity2 's treatment of the mentally ill into an international debate			1
as years went by @entity102 's grand buildings fell victim to decay and overcrowding			0
finally , in 1988 , its directors could take no more			0
all patients were moved to a modern complex next to the original site , but the central block was still used by administration staff for another 15 years until they , too , left in 2003 and the doors closed for good			2
last year the state of @entity11 announced plans to tear down the asylum in a $ 50million project to expand the new complex , prompting outcry among those who wanted to preserve it			2
the last buildings on the campus are expected to be demolished within months after authorities received six offers , but ruled all would require some sort of state subsidy			1
in december the @entity174 group accused @entity11 's administration of failing to engage with developers who wanted to re-use and restore the historic building			2
@entity178 and asbestos : now unfit for human habitation , this was once the parlour on the self - contained campus where the 7,000 patients could go for a haircut learning : the school room inside the campus , which over the years taught many people with complex issues which psychiatrists had yet to fully understand silver lining : @entity11 's authorities rejected six alternative offers for the site , claiming all of them would have required public money , and chose to demolish it instead urban explorer @entity32 , 31 , said : ' holes in the roof have let in rain and snow , which has allowed plants to take root in the floors			1
@entity205 and ice appear in winter ' ' the private sector has expressed interest in re-purposing it , and other historic structures on the site as well , thus preserving them for future generations and sparing taxpayers the terrible costs of their destruction , ' they said in a statement			0
' the administration failed to follow through , changed course , and did their best to create the perception that it was financially “ infeasible ” for the private sector to make a go of it			0
' volunteer @entity223 added : ' failure to redeem a local icon exacts a cost on public morale			0
people rightly value their history – good , bad or indifferent , and the near universal response to the prospect of the @entity233 ’s demise is “ what a shame ” , “ what a waste ” , “ too bad they could n’t find a way to do something with it			0
” ' urban explorer @entity32 , 31 , made a tour of the eerie interior and took the haunting photos in this collection			0
she said : ' the interior of @entity6 has fallen into various states of decay			2
the wards furthest from the centre are the most destroyed since they were abandoned first			0
the top floors have seen the worst of it			0
' holes in the roof have let in rain and snow , which has allowed plants to take root in the floors			0
piles of snow and ice appear in the winter			0
' at the centre of the building the administration block is remarkably well preserved			0
in fact , the power was still on until just a few months ago			0
' the whole building is covered in hazardous asbestos and mould			0
' grand : @entity274 staircases inside the huge complex , which expanded throughout the first half of the @entity277 as soldiers returned from the @entity71 room with a view : leaves creep in through the window of one of the wards			0
preservationists were furious at the @entity11 administration for ' ignoring ' other offers			2

@entity6 , @entity11 , was largest building in @entity2 until @entity50 surpassed it in 1943
