@entity0 has called @entity2 's bluff regarding a potential grudge fight between the pair - telling his @entity5 rival : ' it 's not about money for me			1
' the calls for @entity2 to finally settle his long - running feud with @entity0 have grown stronger in the last few days , but the @entity12 fighter insists he has more pressing issues			1
while @entity2 is keen to meet the @entity16 welterweight champion ' one day ' , he added he would be keen on a winner - takes - all fight			1
@entity0 called out @entity2 in an interview after beating @entity20 in @entity21 on saturday night @entity2 's last fight came against @entity23 in december , whom he beat to take his record to 30 - 3 brook , though , is unfazed as he told @entity25 : ' it 's not about money for me			1
it 's about everywhere i go , ( people asking ) " when are you going to fight him ? "			2
' it 's public demand now			0
i think that he 's getting forced in to this fight if he gets in			2
' @entity0 defended his world title with a four - round demolition job of mandatory challenger @entity20 over the weekend and is supremely confident he could do a similar job on @entity2 , whose much - maligned chin is still considered to be a major weakness			1
' he 's been knocked down to the canvas by super-featherweights in his career , ' said @entity0			1
' he 's fighting a big , strong welterweight in myself who 's a world champion , who 's very confident , who 's never lost , who 's determined to flatten him			0
' do n't get me wrong , @entity2 is a very , very , very good fighter ; very fast hands , most definitely the fastest hands i will have been in with			0
but the fact is when i connect on his chin , it 's good night @entity51			0
' i 'm all wrong for him			0
i 'll find a way to catch him , we 've got 12 rounds			0
we 'll have the perfect gameplan			0
' @entity0 demolished @entity20 in @entity21 , beating him in just four rounds to retain his @entity16 @entity59 title @entity2 has previously refused a fight with @entity0 but now promises it will take place within 12 months @entity2 , though , is chasing a showdown with the winner of the @entity67 - @entity66 super-fight and told @entity0 earlier on tuesday that he would have to wait his turn			1
' i 'd love to fight @entity0 because it could be his last fight - i 'd give him so much of a beating that it could end up being his last fight , ' @entity2 told @entity25			1
' maybe he wants it because he knows that one fight against me will financially secure him for the rest of his life			0
' but it 's all about timing			0
if i 've got a different route and i want to face the likes of @entity67 or @entity66 out there ; @entity0 will have to wait			0
' it 'll happen one day and if @entity0 really wants to fight me , i 'll fight him , but the winner takes all			2
i 'll do a huge bonus because i know he 's going to lose the fight			0
' give him a little guarantee , but the guy who wins the fight takes a big lump sum			0
that 's how confident i am against @entity0			2
' brook , pictured celebrating his win over @entity20 on saturday , appears to have got his wish to fight @entity2 promoter @entity94 has responded to @entity2 by claiming the @entity96 silver medallist has no interest in meeting his boxer			1
' @entity2 seems to have this thing in his head about @entity0 not respecting him , ' @entity94 told @entity25			1
' @entity0 does n't want to respect him - he wants to knock him out			2
@entity0 does n't like him			0
' it 's a tough fight			0
you ca n't take anything away from @entity2 - he 's a quality fighter			2
' i just always felt that @entity0 would win the fight			2
i do n't think @entity2 would deal with @entity0 's power			1
' right now , @entity0 is golden and @entity2 is struggling to find an opponent			1
whatever opponent he 'll choose on may 30 is n't going to be @entity0 and that 's not what the public want			2
people will be disappointed with the opponent			0
' @entity2 has put himself under pressure saying the fight will happen in the next 12 months and we hope so but unfortunately for him , @entity0 's stock continues to rise and the split is probably getting worse and worse as days go by			1
' winner takes all ? i 'll believe that when i see it because they have no desire to fight @entity0			1
