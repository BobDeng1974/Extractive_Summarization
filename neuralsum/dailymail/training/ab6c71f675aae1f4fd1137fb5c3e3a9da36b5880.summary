by @entity0 published : 11:30 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 11:40 est , 21 november 2012 two weeks after his presidential ambitions sank without trace @entity3 is moving to @entity5 and there are certanly worse places for a former candidate to wash up			2
where money meets the sea : @entity3 's $ 12million beachfront home in @entity12 , @entity13 and the place where he and @entity15 intend to move ... though they have big plans for the place			1
life 's a beach : @entity3 and @entity21 show no signs of missing the trappings and pressures of the presidential campaign @entity3 , 65 , and his wife @entity15 have spoken of plans to move to their home in @entity12 , @entity13 - an area known locally as the place ' where money meets the sea '			1
the couple paid $ 12million cash for their @entity36 style home in @entity13 's ' jewel ' four years ago			1
and after so many months of teetering on the fiscal cliff it is easy to see why , for @entity3 , a move to his @entity12 bolthole with its 61 feet of beach frontage appeals			1
@entity44 of worship : @entity13 's @entity46 set in 7.2 acres of @entity12 dominates the skyline with its twin steeples @entity49 , described by one political commentator , as ' an active ' man it seems unlikely that @entity3 will simply pull up a sun - lounger and put up his feet			1
the couple reportedly have plans to demolish the villa as it now stands and replace it with a sprawling home twice the size			0
the location also has a stong draw for the devout @entity62 as @entity12 is home to the @entity64			2
the vast twin - steepled building to which @entity3 is believed to have contributed financially , covers 72,000square feet of this stretch of @entity13			1
having a whale of a time : @entity3 enjoys @entity69 on tuesday			2
if he 's missing politics it certainly is n't showing @entity3 never was a career politician			2
the gladhanding and electioneering never came easy to the former @entity75 governor			0
perhaps that is why , in the days since the 2012 nominee conceded he has shown no signs of missing the trappings of the power that hoevered , so briefly , within his grasp			0
pumping gas at his local station in @entity12 , @entity3 was happy to talk about his @entity5 plans stipped of the 24 hour security detail , the cavalcade of cars , the assistants , campaign managers , make - up artists and stylists @entity3 has relaxed with his family			1
two weeks to the day since losing the election , he visited @entity94 with his wife and grandchildren and evidently had a whale of a time			0
the former @entity100 nominee has also been seen out with his wife catching the latest installment of the twilight saga in @entity104 , @entity5			0
gone is the relentlessly slicked back hair and in its place a decidedly more dishevelled look ; while open neck shirts and rolled up sleeves have replaced the rigid tailoring of the campaign			0
pumping gas at his local station in @entity115 was happy to talk to bystanders			0
one , mkb95 , posted on @entity117 : ' @entity3 at my local gas station ... he looks tired and washed up			0
' @entity3 chatted , ' for a good three minutes while he was filling his tank , ' and among the chat he spoke of his and @entity15 's intended move to @entity12			1
after his relations with the @entity100 turned distinctly chilly little wonder that @entity3 should choose to spend his time on the more clement @entity127 coast .			0

@entity3 's *post-defeat* move to @entity12 , @entity13
he and wife @entity15 's ambitious plans for the $ 12million beachfront bolthole
