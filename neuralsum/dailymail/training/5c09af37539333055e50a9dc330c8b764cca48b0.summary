catholic bishops meeting to discuss ' family issues ' at a two week summit have scrapped plans to welcome gay members of the @entity5			1
showing deep divisions at the end of the @entity10 synod , which was sought by @entity11 in part to chart a more merciful approach to homosexuals , the bishops failed to approve even a watered - down section on ministering to gay @entity5			1
@entity17 through the summit , a draft document was released proposing remarkably progressive plans for the @entity5 , saying unmarried couples living together can be ' positive ' , and gay relationships and divorcees must be welcomed			1
but by the time the synod ended , the welcoming tone of acceptance had been stripped away and replaced by a paragraph describing homosexuality as a ' problem ' @entity5 families have to confront			1
progressive : showing deep divisions at the end of the @entity10 synod , sought by @entity11 in part to chart a more merciful approach to homosexuals , bishops failed to approve even watered - down proposals rather than considering gays as individuals who had gifts to offer the church , the revised paragraph referred to homosexuality as one of the problems @entity5 families have to confront			1
it said ' people with homosexual tendencies must be welcomed with respect and delicacy , ' but repeated church teaching that marriage is only between man and woman			0
the paragraph failed to reach the two - thirds majority needed to pass			2
two other paragraphs concerning the other hot - button issue at the synod of bishops — whether divorced and civilly remarried @entity5 can receive @entity59 — also failed to pass			1
the outcome showed a deeply divided church on some of the most pressing issues facing @entity5 families			1
it appeared that the 118 - 62 vote on the gay section might have been a protest vote by progressive bishops who refused to back the watered - down wording			1
the original draft had said gays had gifts to offer the church and that their partnerships , while morally problematic , provided gay couples with ' precious ' support			2
new era : pope @entity11 is pictured at the synod last week			2
displaying remarkably liberal attitudes for a church famed for its conservatism , a draft document that emerged midway through the synod said gay members must be welcomes and unmarried couples living together can be ' positive ' @entity86 , a @entity5 gay rights group , said it was ' very disappointing ' that the final report had backtracked from the welcoming words contained in the draft			1
nevertheless , it said the synod 's process ' and openness to discussion provides hope for further development down the road , particularly at next year 's synod , where the makeup of the participants will be larger and more diverse , including many more pastorally - oriented bishops			2
' the draft had been written by a @entity11 appointee , monsignor @entity103 , a theologian known for pushing the pastoral envelope on ministering to people in ' irregular ' unions			0
the draft was supposed to have been a synopsis of the bishops ' interventions , but many conservatives complained that it reflected a minority and overly progressive view			2
@entity11 insisted in the name of transparency that the full document — including the paragraphs that failed to pass — be published along with the voting tally			0
the document will serve as the basis for future debate leading up to another meeting of bishops next october that will produce a final report to be sent to @entity11			2
' personally i would have been very worried and saddened if there had n't been these ... animated discussions ... or if everyone had been in agreement or silent in a false and acquiescent peace , ' @entity11 told the synod hall after the vote			0
prayer : rather than considering gays as individuals who had gifts to offer the church , the final plans referred to homosexuality as one of the problems @entity5 families have to confront conservatives had harshly criticized the draft and proposed extensive revisions to restate church doctrine , which holds that gay sex is ' intrinsically disordered , ' but that gays themselves are to be respected , and that marriage is only between a man and woman			1
' we could see that there were different viewpoints , ' said cardinal @entity155 of @entity156 , when asked about the most contentious sections of the report on homosexuals and divorced and remarried @entity5			0
@entity161 cardinal @entity160 , the leader of the progressive camp , said he was ' realistic ' about the outcome			0
in an unexpected gesture after the voting , @entity11 approached a group of journalists waiting outside the synod hall to thank them for their work covering the synod			0
' thanks to you and your colleagues for the work you have done , ' he said			0
' conservative bishops had harshly criticized journalists for reporting on the dramatic shift in tone in the draft , even though the media reports merely reflected the document 's content			1
meeting : two other paragraphs concerning the other hot - button issue at the synod of bishops — whether divorced and civilly remarried @entity5 can receive @entity59 — also failed to pass at the synod @entity11 ' gesture , and his words inside the synod hall chastising bishops who were overly wed to doctrine and were guided by ' hostile rigidity , ' as well as those bishops who showed a ' destructive goody - goodiness , ' indicated that he was well aware of the divisions the debate had sparked			1
his speech received a four - minute standing ovation , participants said			0
over the past week , the bishops split themselves up into working groups to draft amendments to the text			2
they were nearly unanimous in insisting that church doctrine on family life be more fully asserted and that faithful @entity5 families should be held up as models and encouraged rather than focus on family problems and ' irregular ' unions			1
the bishops signaled a similar tone in a separate message directed at @entity217 families released saturday			1
there was no mention whatsoever of families with gay children , much less gay parents , and it spoke of the ' complex and problematic ' issues that arise when marriages fail and new relationships begin			0
' @entity226 wanted his church to be a house with the door always open to welcome everyone , without excluding anyone , ' the message read			0
( oddly , the @entity233 translation was less welcoming than the official @entity234 , ending the sentence after ' everyone			0
' ) welcome : @entity10 @entity238 guards salute @entity11 as he arrives for the synod last week cardinal @entity240 of @entity241 , who helped draft the revised final report , told @entity243 the final document showed a ' common vision ' that was lacking in the draft			2
he said the key areas for concern were ' presenting homosexual unions as if they were a very positive thing ' and the suggestion that divorced and remarried @entity5 should be able to receive @entity59 without an annulment			0
he complained that the draft was presented as the opinion of the whole synod , when it was ' one or two people			0
' ' and that made people very angry , ' he said .			0
