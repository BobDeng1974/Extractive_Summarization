as some @entity53 fans will know , listeners face five minutes and 20 seconds at a slower before @entity54 roars into life indie band @entity32 were renowned for their ' soft - loud ' dynamic because of songs like @entity35 , which has a long , quieter period before a sudden crescendo this technique is commonly used in drum and bass music , but the app shows it was common in rock songs of old			1
creator of the where is the @entity7 ? app @entity16 explained how the app worked on his blog			1
the app grabs the detailed audio analysis for the song and finds the 30 - second period where volume increases the most , he said			0
extra weight is given to louder crescendos , so if two parts of a track increase in volume by 20 decibels , the louder of the two will be used for the sound clip			0
during the process of making the app , mr @entity16 realised that he would not be able to stop the track after the 30 - second clip			2
instead , the app automatically switches to silent song 4 â€™ 33 by @entity99 after any clip is played			0
mr @entity16 said : ' the idea of the app is to find the epic moment , the dramatic moment , in the music			1
' the app breaks down the song , looking at the volume throughout and finds the most dramatic increases			2
' it 's been a very popular download			0
some people have been using it to find the most dramatic parts of movie soundtracks			0
it 's also popular for dubstep , but there 's a whole range			0
' this is definitely a novelty app. it 's a tongue - in - cheek app that takes you straight to your favourite part of the song			1
he added that the app could be used in future to help musicians work out at what point listeners get bored with a song and move on			1
' people often just mix songs as loud as they can to grab the listener 's attention , ' mr @entity16 told the @entity136			1
' the algorithm shows that music which has a diverse range of sounds and a wider use of dynamics sounds better			0
' ' skipping straight to the dramatic bits is like a reader going to the final page of a mystery novel to find out who did it			0
' the app is a bit of a novelty but people can see whether the computer agrees with you about where the best , most dramatic section of a song is			2
