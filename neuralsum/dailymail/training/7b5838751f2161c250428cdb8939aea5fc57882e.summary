by @entity0 right @entity1 is back in the spotlight as part of the pop group @entity4 , put together by tv show @entity6			1
before that it 's fair to say he had a roller - coaster ride of fame and fortune , including stints on @entity13 and his time as a pop pin up in the late 90s			2
but despite all that , perhaps it is the star 's experience of bulimia that has most shaped him as a person			1
however , the tv star revealed on @entity32 that the catalyst for his bulimia was nothing to do with a desire to look good , but all started when he was injured during a rugby game at school			1
' it all started in 1994 with a rugby match , ' he explained			1
' all i wanted was to be a rugby player and was under pressure through school			2
' then during one match i dislocated both shoulders and in hospital i picked up a virus that made me lose weight ' @entity1 went on to explain that the injury meant his rugby career was over and he became depressed , finding himself trying to figure out who he was			1
' i did n't know myself , i did n't fit in , i was so scared so i had fixated on rugby			2
' through the virus i picked up in hospital i lost so much weight so had been eating a lot to try to put it back on			2
' one day i was sitting eating a big bowl of cereal and had been so focused on just eating and thinking about nothing else , that when i stood up i was accidentally , physically sick			0
' i had n't meant to be , but it made me realise i had wasted an hour and a half away , where i did n't have to think about anything so i did it again straight away			0
' at his worst @entity1 admits to being sick up to 30 times a day and dropping to around 6st in weight			1
he is keen to spread awareness of the illness as 11 per cent of sufferers are men and @entity1 stresses that eating disorders are the same as any other mental illness and the that the driving force is not always about physical appearance			1
@entity1 , 35 , suffered from bulimia and wants people to treat eating disorders just like any other mental illness , adding they are not about vanity ' i 'm trying to make people realise that an eating disorder is like any other mental illness			1
' it 's about focusing on one thing			0
' @entity1 says if someone is suffering an eating disorder there is more than likely an under lying issue , which goes deeper than how they feel about the way they look and that that is simply something to focus on as a distraction			1
' if someone does n't love themselves , it 's about asking why do n't they ? ' he said			0
of his own illness @entity1 revealed that he was so unwell he was bringing up blood and that those around him knew but had no idea how to help			1
' i was throwing up blood , i knew everybody knew , i was acting different			2
' everybody knew but did n't know how to help and i was so embarrassed			0
' i would go to bed every night praying not to wake up but i could n't [ do anything like that ] because i knew my mum knew i had bulimia and she would blame herself			1
' @entity1 described the horrible side effects of making himself sick such as ' always being cold ' and often passing out and explained how it was a chance comment from his mother that began his turn around			1
' it was @entity127 1995 and mum had just done a big weekly shop			0
' she just said ' if you throw all this up i 'll never speak to you again - it was like a cricket bat across the face			0
' slowly @entity1 began to try to change his ways			2
he tried various therapies that did n't work and in the end worked hard to make himself better			0
' i did it methodically , ' he said ' i checked my temperature each day [ to see if he was getting better ] ' i weaned myself off being sick			0
i had to calm my body down because it was so tuned to being sick and getting rid of whatever i put in it			0
@entity1 , far left , with 5th story band mates @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 ' quitting an addiction to something that involves food is very hard because you still have to eat			2
' getting over the physical side took around 18 months but the mental side is much harder and it took me until i was about 30 to be able to look in the mirror and know who i was ' this @entity23 's resident gp dr @entity56 urged anyone suffering from an eating disorder to visit a gp where they can be referred to a specialist and added ' there is no quick fix , it takes time			0
' @entity166 , is performing as part of the man - band 5th story - made up of other previous pop stars including @entity170 's @entity147 , @entity146 , @entity145 and @entity144			0
