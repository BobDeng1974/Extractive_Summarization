@entity0 , head of the high - flying @entity2 secondary school in @entity3 , asked parents to make monthly donations a high - flying state school head who wrote to parents asking them to make voluntary contributions of up to £ 30 a month has said sorry after being accused of pressurising struggling families			1
@entity0 said opportunities at @entity2 in @entity3 were similar to some private schools charging fees of up to £ 10,000 a year , but said the school 's efforts to improve were hampered by a lack of government funds			1
so he asked all parents to make voluntary contributions of £ 10 , £ 20 or £ 30 a month , by standing order , which he said was not ' a great sum to contribute towards a child ’s education '			1
the head , who has been in the post since 2005 , then had to apologise after parents said they already paid for the boys ' school through taxes and criticised him for ' undermining the state school system '			1
the school has been running a voluntary contribution scheme for 10 years and already receives around £ 20,000 a year as a result from some parents of the 830 boys at the school , but mr @entity0 ' letter was an attempt to encourage more to take part			1
mr @entity0 has since apologised for the ‘ unhelpful ’ wording of the letter , which he sent earlier this month			1
in it , he wrote : ' independent school fees are normally over £ 10,000 a year per pupil			1
' at @entity2 education is free but , if parents are willing to give a fraction of that money , we could achieve so much more			2
' we are asking all families for a voluntary contribution of £ 30 , £ 20 or £ 10 per month to the new top - up scheme			1
' we believe that this is n’t a great sum to contribute towards a child ’s education			0
' of course we appreciate that some parents do not have the resources to contribute			0
thankfully there are some generous parents who are already contributing significantly			0
' if you are already supporting then we are of course most grateful , but please review your contribution			0
' @entity2 boys ' school is judged @entity64 ' outstanding ' and already receives £ 20,000 a year in donations mr @entity0 succeeded the former head , @entity66 , at the 830 - boy secondary school in 2005 his suggestion was criticised by mother @entity69 , whose son attends @entity2 , judged ' outstanding ' by @entity64			1
writing on a parents ' online forum , she accused the school of ' attempting to blur the lines ' between state and independent schools and of ' putting pressure on parents '			2
in her post on @entity80 , mrs @entity69 added : ' it introduces the idea of parents contributing financially to state schools on a regular basis with the aim of it becoming the norm			2
' this undermines our state school system			0
it is putting financial and moral pressure on parents at a time when many are struggling			0
' it ignores the fact that we already pay for state schooling through our taxes			0
mr @entity0 wrote a second letter to parents apologising for using ' unhelpful ' wording in his letter to them ' his - and our - time would be better spent campaigning for increased state funding than supporting schemes that erode the principle of free education and lead to greater inequality			1
' mr @entity0 claimed that voluntary contribution schemes were widely used by schools in @entity3 , and said that pupils were not asked to pay for after - school clubs unless external coaches were involved			1
' we have an incredible range of activities and we try to make sure that no one is disadvantaged by the lack of money , ' he added			0
last month parents of children at @entity123 in @entity124 complained after the school proposed that they would pay for each @entity127 pupil to buy an @entity128 at a cost to parents of £ 360 over three years			1
the school said the scheme would boost pupil attainment levels but parents questioned the merits of the scheme and the cost			2
state schools asking parents for voluntary contributions for the benefit of school or school activities is increasingly common			2
some schools ask for donations in the form of monthly standing orders , as at @entity2 , while others appeal for parental help when they need to fund a specific purchase , for example a new sports pitch			0
the @entity153 guidance says there is nothing in schools legislation to prevent a school governing body or local authority from asking for voluntary contributions			0
however schools may not ask parents to set up a direct debit , and parents must not be made to feel pressurised into paying			0
the guidance also states that if the activity the funds are being raised for can not be funded without voluntary contributions , the governing body or head teacher should make this clear to parents at the outset			2
the governing body or head teacher must also make it clear to parents that there is no obligation to make any contribution .			0

@entity176 in @entity3 wrote to all parents asking for money
@entity0 suggested they agree to £ 10 , £ 20 or £ 30 a month donations
@entity64 ' outstanding ' school already receives £ 20,000 a year this way
mr @entity0 wanted more boys ' parents to join the contributions scheme
one mother , @entity69 , complained he was pressurising parents
the head then wrote again saying sorry for the letter 's ' unhelpful ' wording
