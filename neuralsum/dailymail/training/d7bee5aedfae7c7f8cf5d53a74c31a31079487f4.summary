@entity0 believes that for @entity3 to qualify for the @entity4 this season , their record needs to improve against the @entity7 's big hitters			1
spurs finished sixth in the @entity7 last season , but their record against top - four clubs was diabolical , as they picked up just a single point in eight games , scoring just two goals and conceding an almighty 27			1
and of particular damage were the 6 - 0 defeat away at @entity16 , and the 5 - 0 loss at home to @entity19 that cost @entity20 his job			2
in action : @entity0 against @entity24 's @entity23 on their pre-season tour not good enough : @entity0 believes @entity3 need to improve to qualify for the @entity4 @entity0 told @entity26 : ' we did well against most of the other teams but against the top teams we were not very good and we were beaten pretty badly			1
' i do not know why that was			0
' at the start of the game you do n't really think about it			0
you just think it is another game			0
' but when you start to go three or four - nil down , you start to realise you are in a mega-big mess			0

@entity3 picked up just a point against @entity7 top - four last season
