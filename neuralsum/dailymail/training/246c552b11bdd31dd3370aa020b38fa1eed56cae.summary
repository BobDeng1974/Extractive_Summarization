the @entity0 , the @entity1 and raging night storms illuminate the night sky in @entity5 's @entity4 in this stunning timelapse video captured by @entity8 photographer and videographer @entity9			1
the ever - changing canopy of clouds and constellations provides an ethereal backdrop to otherwise everyday scenes of fields , farms and tranquil lakes			0
one lake is bathed in a green , eerie glow while in another shot , the stars appear to spin in the sky behind silhouetted trees			0
the 47 - year - old spent 40 nights across eight - months using a wide - angle lens and long exposures to obtain the crystal - clear footage			1
@entity9 , from @entity53 , @entity8 , started up a stock footage company selling pictures of storms in the 1990s but decided to started shooting timelapse videos four years ago			1
‘ i just decided i was looking for something a little bit different other than storms so that ’s how i got into the long exposure timelapse ' , he explains			0
branching out : @entity9 used to photograph storms but decided to started shooting timelapse videos four years ago remote : @entity9 captured the footage in some of the most isolated regions of the @entity44 , including @entity8 , @entity45 and @entity46 dedicated : the photographer spent 40 nights across eight - months using a wide - angle lens and long exposures to obtain the crystal - clear footage shock and awe : @entity9 put his experience of shooting storms to good use , capturing this impressive shot of lightning in the night sky the dedicated videographer battled with cloudy weather conditions to achieve the amazing footage of the dramatic @entity4 night sky			1
he said : ' i use @entity85 [ digital single - lens reflex ] cameras to shoot long exposure timelapse at night with up to 30 - seconds per frame			1
' i then assembled the individual frames into the timelapse on my computer			0
i spent a lot of time with the hue settings and white balance during the month - and - a - half edit			2
' the weather in 2013 made it difficult for me to get some of the shots i wanted			2
there were many times i planned to shoot the @entity0 or @entity100 , and the clouds would roll in			0
' seeing things with a new eye : @entity9 's images bring a whole new dimension to everyday landscapes back to nature : the photographer uses a dslr camera on a 6ft metal rail , that is set up to move the camera smoothly in time with the sky @entity113 - clear : the dedicated videographer battled with all weather conditions to achieve the amazing footage of the dramatic @entity4 night sky red sky at night : @entity9 said there were many times when he planned to shoot the @entity0 or @entity100 , and the clouds would roll in @entity9 , who also owns a farm in @entity8 , takes hundreds of still photos over several hours and then ‘ stitches ’ them together to create amazing sequences			1
' at a normal rate you do n’t notice how the @entity129 is rotating and it looks like the stars are moving across the sky			0
' it just speeds up everything so much more than you ’re used to seeing ' , he said			0
@entity9 said he got some of his best shots of the @entity0 in @entity45 but he was often hampered by cloud			1
he also captured several satellites and a couple of meteors in the shots : ‘ the meteors are hard to see in time - lapse , but you may see a quick flash because they only last one frame			2
if you see a light moving across the sky , it is either an airplane or satellite , not a meteor			0
’ and he explained that capturing the stunning red or green glow of the @entity100 was often not planned : ' some of the @entity100 i shot were unexpected with no advanced notice			0
several nights i was setting up @entity0 shots , when i noticed the glow in the sky to the north			2
' a new direction : @entity9 used to photograph storms but decided to opt for a more serene subject matter four years ago labour of love : @entity9 takes hundreds of still photos over several hours and then ‘ stitches ’ them together to create amazing sequences perfect timing : @entity9 said there were many times when it was difficult for him to get the shot he wanted but here he captures the night sky in all its glory most of @entity9 's footage is shot at night and , if you can see stars and it looks like the sun setting or rising , it is actually the moon : ' it will light up the landscape just like the sun with long exposures ' , he explains			1
he used a dolly , a 6ft metal rail , that is set up to move the camera smoothly in time with the sky and gives it what @entity9 calls the ‘ walking through it look ’			0
@entity9 says : ' people love my pictures - some even say they are blown away			2
' i do get the occasional comment from someone who thinks it is fake and it is a @entity200 spaceship picture inserted into the background			0
' but it would actually take more time to do that than shoot the real time - lapse			0
' those who want to learn @entity9 ’s techniques can join him for a photography workshop in @entity208 in @entity8			1
students can learn the basics of timelapse photography , along with how to scout the best locations and deal with changing weather conditions			1
