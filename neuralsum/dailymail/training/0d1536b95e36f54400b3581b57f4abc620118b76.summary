a horsemeat snack is being launched as a healthy high protein food for fitness fanatics			0
the ‘ a @entity4 ’ snack is a form of biltong , which is normally made from beef , and has just 114 calories in a 50g pack			1
the snack is made in @entity10 from @entity10 horses and is being promoted as a far healthier option than a pack of crisps by the specialist retailer @entity15			1
after last year 's horsemeat scandal , specialist sports food retailer @entity16 is selling ' a bag of @entity20 ' biltong as a high - protein snack , made in @entity10 ( file photo ) last year , millions of @entity23 were disgusted to discover that leading supermarkets and fast food outlets had been selling beefburgers that turned out to contain a high percentage of horse			1
people were alarmed to find they had been misled , while the discovery lifted the lid on a much wider problem of food fraud			0
fancy eating a horse ? @entity35 has suggested that a viable market in pony meat ( left ) for human consumption is the only way to save the species			1
sausages made out of pony meat are also pictured ( right ) subsequently , some chefs , horse lovers and even the princess royal suggested eating horse should be embraced by way of promoting a market in the meat and improving animal welfare			1
a spokesman for the web store said : ‘ customers are being urged to reach for a bag of horse rather than a packet of crisps , due to its excellent nutritional and health benefits			2
@entity58 , a director at the firm , said : ‘ more and more people are eating horse as part of their balanced diet			1
i would even go as far as saying it is now acceptable and has lost its stigma ' ‘ the standard 50g packet of biltong , which is similar in texture to beef jerky , contains just 114 calories			1
this is less than half the calories of packet of plain crisps of the same size , 263 calories			2
’ the packets also contains 21g of protein , 2.85g of carbohydrates and just 2.1g of fat , which is healthier mix that the 3.05g protein , 25.75g carbohydrates and 15.9g fat found in a standard bag of crisps			2
unusual dish : @entity35 founder @entity87 with a plate full of roast @entity90 pony meat on her farm in @entity94 the biltong is made by marinating horse steaks in black pepper , coriander and vinegar , before it is hung to air - dry in a controlled environment as part of a curing process			1
@entity58 , a director at the firm , said : ‘ more and more people are eating horse as part of their balanced diet			1
i would even go as far as saying it is now acceptable and has lost its stigma			1
the princess royal ( left ) appeared to give her support to eating horses in a speech to the @entity115 last year ‘ the horse biltong is delicious			1
like jerky , biltong is chewy however unlike the beef one , it is moister and has a sweeter flavour			0
also because they take longer to eat as well as being high in protein , they will leave you feeling fuller for longer			0
‘ people are becoming far more adventurous when it comes to trying different meat			0
for many , as long as it is humanly and sustainably sourced they are prepared to give it a go			0
’ he added : ‘ far too often when people are peckish they reach for something unhealthy such as a packet of crisps or chocolate biscuits			2
we say they should reach for a bag of horse – it ’s certainly the healthier option			0
’ the princess royal appeared to give her support to eating horses in a speech to the @entity115 last year			2
she suggested owners might take better care of their horses if they believed they could sell them for meat			0
just last month the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) said it believed the best way to save herds on the ancient moorland is by putting them on the menu in restaurants and homes , which would give them a value			0
founder of the @entity35 , @entity87 said herders would only continue to keep the animals if there was a ‘ sustainable market ’ for them			2
in a letter proposing the idea sent to @entity167 ( @entity167 ) , she said : ‘ i am writing to ask whether @entity167 would consider giving measured support to this understandably upsetting subject , which as pony lovers we find so hard to accept			0
‘ it has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that @entity90 pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them			0
’ she said a meat trade would encourage herders to keep the young ponies for at least three years , which is the earliest they could be slaughtered for meat .			0
