dating expert and celebrity psychologist @entity151 , below right , has written five books on sex and relationships			1
she gave @entity156 her top tips for avoiding romantic bloopers in your own life ...			1
@entity161 while the person occupies your every waking moment and it 's tempting to keep texting them just to make sure they feel the same way , my advice is step away from the phone			0
send them a ' thanks for the evening , it was fun ' message , by all means , but if you do n't get an immediate response , do not send another one to check to see if they got the first one or have had some terrible accident			0
@entity185 it 's hugely tempting to befriend your new beau on @entity189 or follow them on @entity191 , but leave this for a little while as the relationship needs to find its own pace and this can often look way too keen , way too early @entity196 past relationships are , inevitably , going to come up as a topic of conversation on the first few dates , but keep it detail - free and as light as possible			0
this conversation always changes the energy of a new relationship in the early days , and not in a good way			0
we 've all got a past , some of it fraught with angst , but leave this conversation for much later on down the line			0
@entity213 it 's always good to have a busy life outside of a new relationship ; most people like someone who is independent and fulfilled , and you do n't want to be seen to be too available			0
but there are times when you 'll need to juggle your social life to accommodate a date , otherwise you 'll be booking them in three - weeks - on - tuesday , thus robbing this promising relationship of any natural momentum			2
think in threes i hate too many prescriptive ' rules ' in dating , but sometimes we need an easy structure that we can call on for a bit of reassurance when we 're not sure we'e doing the ' right ' thing			2
so , very roughly ... .			0
