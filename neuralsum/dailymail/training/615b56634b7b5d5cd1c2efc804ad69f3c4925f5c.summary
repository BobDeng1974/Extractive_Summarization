by @entity0 published : 03:41 est , 21 june 2012 updated : 05:47 est , 21 june 2012 a mother has told how she believed her child was the anti-christ as she endured traumatic hallucinations after giving birth to her son			1
@entity6 seemed like the perfect mother - breastfeeding her baby son , keeping the house clean and baking cakes , but she was going through a secret trauma			1
she told @entity12 she had become convinced her baby had the face of the @entity15			1
a mother 's trauma : @entity18 said she started suffering terrible hallucinations as soon as she had given birth ( file picture ) ' i had my son in 2007			1
immediately after his traumatic birth , i knew something was wrong , ' she said			1
' i had it in my head that he had died during childbirth			2
by the time i got home , i was completely loopy			2
i was convinced i 'd given birth to the anti-christ and that was my role			1
' every time i looked at him , i saw the face of the devil			1
i saw dancing little devils in the room			2
when i breastfed , i was afraid he would eat off my chest			0
' on the outside i seemed to be @entity44 but on the inside everything was crumbling apart			0
' i told my husband i was going to open a goat farm in a warehouse in the middle of @entity50 and feed milk to asylum seekers			0
i could n't understand why he did n't think it was a good idea			0
' my husband thought i was losing it and the midwives thought i was doing really well until they started asking all the questions and realised things were n't right			0
' @entity6 , who now lives near @entity58 , @entity59 , said she was diagnosed with post-natal depression - but she was actually suffering from post-partum psychosis , which is experienced by an estimated 1 in 1,000 new mothers in the @entity63 every year			1
she added : ' i had to go and be part of a depressed people group but i was on a complete high and they were all sitting around crying			0
it was the wrong treatment for me			0
' @entity6 did n't get any medication at all and it took nine months for the psychosis to tail off			1
she said she was frightened about having another child but when she was pregnant and had a daughter in 2009 she had support from a psychiatric nurse			0
' for the first couple of hours after the birth i felt great but it was when i got home things started to go wonky again , ' she said			2
trauma : @entity6 was suffering from post-partum psychosis but was incorrectly diagnosed ( picture posed by models ) ' this time i had dripping dead torsos living at the bottom of the garden			1
part of their bodies would come whizzing at the windows of the house			0
i told my husband and psychiatric nurse			0
' @entity6 declined medication because she preferred to breastfeed her daughter , and because the mother and baby unit was full , her husband had to give up his job to help with round - the - clock care for her at home			1
she said she was not having any more children because she does n't want to go through the hallucinations again			2
@entity6 , a member of @entity105 on @entity106 , which has a website providing information and support , believes that post-partum psychosis , should be discussed with expectant mothers along with post-natal depression , so that they are informed and can seek help if it happens to them			1
' i had no idea about it			0
i 'd never heard of it before			0
it should definitely be discussed to raise awareness among women - not to frighten them			2
' if my husband had known about it , he might have picked up on my illness quicker			0
at the time , he just thought he was losing his wife			0
' @entity127 , chair of @entity63 , who has also suffered post-partum psychosis , said : ' it 's such a tragedy			1
loads of midwives actually do n't even know what post-partum psychosis is			1
' it was illustrated very well for me by a woman who had a very bad episode out of the blue			0
' in one of her ante - natal classes she had seen one leaflet which talked about post-natal depression and three lines about post-partum psychosis			1
' when she was manic , she thought she might have what was in the leaflet and they got the doctors in to see her			0
' when you are feeling really great in pregnancy , you are not going to think you 're going to get it , but if you just hear about it - what it is - it might trigger something if you notice a relative or friend behaving bizarrely after birth			1
' dr @entity158 , a perinatal psychologist at @entity159 for @entity160 , said the ' airbrushed image of perfection ' of new mothers was not the experience for many women			0
there was a long history of a link between psychiatric illness and childbirth			0
' baby blues ' affect half or more of new mothers , while post-natal depression affects affects up to fifteen percent and puerperal or post-partum psychosis is suffered by 1 in 1,000 which means that thousands of mothers are affected every year			1
' it 's a severe psychosis with mixed mood symptoms			2
it 's a psychiatric emergency			0
ideally , the mother and baby need to be taken to a specialist mother and baby unit , ' dr @entity158 said			2
research in @entity188 had shown that the big shifts in hormone levels during the first three or four days after birth , plus the effect of sleep disruption , could trigger psychiatric illness - particularly in bi-polar women			1
there was evidence that genetic factors could be involved - meaning that the risk could run in families .			2

@entity6 was convinced her baby boy had the face of the devil
she was suffering from post-partum psychosis - and not post-natal depression
she endured similar hallucinations when giving birth two baby girl two years later
