by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 03:48 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 7 february 2013 shamed : @entity3 , pictured yesterday , bought an @entity4 on his expenses just before he quit as an mp and was convicted of perverting the course of justice @entity9 has signalled that @entity3 should forfeit his £ 17,207 pay - off as it emerged the former cabinet minister put a £ 600 @entity4 on expenses just days before he quit as an mp on monday			1
mr @entity3 was handed the pay - off when he left the @entity14 last year			1
it is the equivalent of three months ’ of a cabinet minister ’s £ 68,827 annual salary			0
he received this on top of his mp ’s salary of £ 65,738			2
it also emerged yesterday @entity3 had acquired a top - of - the - range @entity23 tablet at taxpayers ’ expense just a fortnight before pleading guilty in court to asking his ex-wife to take his speeding points			1
after a public grilling on his weekly radio show , mr @entity9 made clear he sympathised with those who believed that multi-millionaire @entity3 should ‘ pay amends ’			1
mr @entity9 told his @entity35 radio phone - in show : ‘ i totally understand why people think that now he has pleaded guilty and when he is sentenced that he should pay amends for what ’s happened			2
‘ but at the end of the day @entity3 has got to make that decision			2
i do n’t yet know what sentence the judge is going to hand down to him			0
’ mr @entity9 said he was not going to provide ‘ a running commentary ’ on @entity3 ’s fate			1
the prime minister ’s official spokesman was also asked if @entity3 should repay his settlement			2
he said : ‘ this is a matter for @entity3			2
’ @entity3 – who stood down as the mp for @entity51 this week – is also entitled to claim up to £ 53,150 for winding down his office			1
most of this is for severance pay to staff			0
under the rules of @entity60 , the @entity58 ’ expenses watchdog , mr @entity3 will be free to keep his @entity4 because it would be too costly to hire bailiffs to retrieve it			1
@entity65 , of the @entity66 ’ @entity64 , said : ‘ the timing of this claim ( for the @entity4 ) appears utterly cynical			2
he ca n’t dodge the bill for this expensive gadget like he tried to dodge his speeding points			1
’ expensive : mr @entity3 claimed a new £ 600 @entity4 and will not have to give it back despite his fall from grace @entity74 was left shocked on monday as after nearly two years proclaiming his innocence and fighting to have the case dropped , @entity3 changed his plea at the start of his trial at @entity80 , promptly resigning as @entity50 mp for @entity51 and ending his political career			1
his ex-wife @entity83 , who is in court on the same charge , only revealed she had taken his speeding points to exact revenge on her cheating husband and ' nail him ' after he left her for another woman , the jury was told			1
mr @entity9 will today call the by - election in @entity3 ’s @entity51 seat on february 28 – far earlier than expected – amid @entity50 jitters that it could fall to their coalition partners			1
mr @entity9 fired the starting gun on his campaign today with a savage attack on the conservatives over their failure to agree to a mansion tax on expensive homes , while claiming sole credit for cutting the income tax bill for more than 60,000 basic rate taxpayers in @entity51			1
criminal : former energy secretary @entity3 , with his partner @entity108 , whose affair sparked his ex-wife to seek revenge after taking his speeding points in 2003 , her trial heard this week he used the major speech of the by - election contest to accuse the @entity114 of demanding a tax cut for millionaires while he battled to cut tax bills for low and middle earners			1
mr @entity9 revived the prospect of a mansion tax to target wealthy home owners			2
he said his ' preferred option ' was a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £ 2million , applied just to the value over and above £ 2m			0
alternatively he proposed new council tax bands at the ' top end ' levied on properties worth over £ 2million			2
mr @entity9 said : ' both of these options are based on a very simple principle : that we should ask a small number of very wealthy individuals to make a reasonable contribution , in order to provide desperately needed help for millions of ordinary people			2
' nothing could do more to demonstrate a commitment to greater fairness in our tax system			0
it ’s an open secret that our conservative partners do not share our views on this			0
' however , we will continue to make this argument , in this @entity145 and beyond			0
our approach is simple : taxes on mansions ; tax cuts for millions			0
an approach to tax that puts payslips before palaces , if you like			0
' the @entity155 have indicated that they intend to relentlessly highlight @entity3 's record , who quit the @entity158 on monday after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice after years of denials			1
rivalry : @entity3 and @entity9 clashed during the 2007 leadership to succeed sir @entity164 the by - election contest is likely to be one of the most hotly - contested in recent years , with two governing parties going head - to - head			1
both mr @entity9 and @entity169 know that victory for their party would help settle complaints about their leadership , and defeat will raise serious doubts about their hopes at the 2015 general election			1
@entity50 insisted their decision , as the sitting party in the constituency , to opt for a short contest reflected the high state of preparedness of the local party , even though they have yet to choose a candidate			2
' we are going to throw the kitchen sink at it			0
i 'm pretty sure that the @entity155 will as well , ' one source said			0
speculation : it is thought @entity194 may stand for the conservatives in @entity3 's former seat ' it is going to be a tight contest , and generally in tight contests in two - way marginals you get some pretty robust exchanges			1
' meanwhile conservative chairman @entity203 told the @entity204 : ‘ the residents of @entity51 have for a long time been sold a lie by their @entity50 mp			1
that ’s why they ’ll welcome the opportunity to express the way they feel about it very soon			0
‘ conservatives will present the opportunity to start afresh with a hard - working local mp who gets on with looking after her constituents			0
’ it is understood that the @entity114 will formally select local mother @entity194 , their candidate in 2010 , to fight the seat again			0
she famously confronted @entity218 over cuts to special schools in the 2005 election campaign			0
her chances of success have been boosted by @entity226 leader @entity225 ’s decision not to stand			0
labour sources are hoping for a strong showing , but are thought to privately accept they have little chances of winning			0
but @entity50 chief whip @entity230 will today move the writ to trigger a by - election in @entity51 in just over three weeks – before the party has even selected a candidate			1
former @entity50 frontbencher dr @entity235 , who fronts the hacked off campaign for a press law , last night ruled himself out , as has @entity50 council leader @entity240			2
a @entity114 victory in @entity51 , which would require a 3.5 per cent swing , would be a shattering blow for mr @entity9			1
no prime minister since @entity245 at the height of her @entity248 popularity has managed to gain a seat in a by - election			1
trial : @entity83 , the ex-wife of @entity3 , is in court over the same charge but denies it on the basis of ' marital coercion ' former energy secretary @entity3 was clocked driving too fast in march 2003 and persuaded @entity83 to take the blame so he could avoid losing his licence			1
the couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after mr @entity3 admitted he was having an affair with his pr adviser @entity108 , 46			2
driven by a thirst for ‘ revenge ’ , mrs @entity83 decided to leak the sensational story that he forced her to take his speeding points to escape a driving ban			1
in one email she wrote : ‘ i really want to nail him			0
more than ever actually , and i would love to do it soon			0
’ @entity80 heard how @entity83 hatched a plot with a journalist from the @entity272 to ‘ set up ’ @entity3 in a series of taped phone calls which were yesterday played to the jury			2
but the wary politician had refused to admit the offence in a series of heated exchanges which only served to illustrate the bitterness of the couple ’s split			0
in one call , @entity3 accuses his former wife of telling the papers that he has split up with the woman he left her for , his bisexual former press adviser @entity286			0
@entity83 responds : ‘ i ’m very pleased for you that you are still with that man of yours			0
’ in another call she complains her home is under siege from journalists saying : ‘ i ca n’t even get home , whether it ’s to do with your * * * * ing man or whether it ’s to do with your * * * * ing points			0
’ @entity3 now faces prison after a £ 150,000 prosecution and a £ 100,000 police investigation bill			1
@entity303 's trial continues today			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
