when it comes to the @entity4 festival , a number of suspect looks crop up each year including hippie ensembles , outlandish headgear and plenty of skin - and 2015 has been no exception			2
but as the first weekend of the arts and music festival wrapped in @entity12 , @entity13 , some of the outfits paraded around the sunny campus - or lack thereof - stood out as being particularly woeful			1
one woman spotted was nude except for a minute chainmail band slung around her hips , two silver star stickers covering her nipples and a breezy shrug			1
another was dressed in a strappy monokini , essentially leaving her practically naked apart from a pair of sturdy boots , a beaded headband , shades and a sheer white printed kimono			2
one festival goer seemed to have taken a leaf from @entity52 's recent catwalk show in which he dressed models in clinging nude bodystockings			2
her skin tight body suit was teamed with gladiator sandals , plenty of tattos and a silver necklace - cum - harness			0
skin on show : string monokinis teamed with lace - up boots ( left ) competed with nude bodysuits and strappy sandals ( right ) on the dodgy style stakes rock on : one woman spotted was nude except for a minute chainmail band slung around her hips , two silver star stickers covering her nipples and a breezy shrug which is worse - clashing florals ( left ) or matchy - matchy two - pieces ( right ) ? time to hit the beard - garden ! this festival goer wove plastic flowers into his facial hair then there was the party animal who threw poses in a lurid , multi-colored swimming costume , complete with shimmering butterfly wings and a clashing patterned bum - bag			1
and speaking of clashing , there was a lot of that			0
celebrity offenders included @entity94 , who strutted around yesterday in a turquoise paint - splattered maxi - dress , and @entity97 , who teamed a metallic gold bikini top with a pair of patchwork denim dungarees and a bright orange bomber jacket			1
the worst fashion moments from just about every recent decade came out in full force ; from the tie - die crop tops of the @entity106 to the deeply unflattering high - waisted ankle - flappers of the @entity108 , and the clashing florals of the @entity110 and @entity111			0
headgear was , as always , blindingly popular , with opulent bejewelled forehead chains and blooming - awful flower crowns the order of the day			0
psychedelic : then there was the party animal who threw poses in a lurid , multi-coloured swimming costume , complete with shimmering butterfly wings and a clashing patterned bum - bag squeaky - clean white was the order of the day for @entity127 's @entity126 ( left ) and @entity129 's @entity128 ( right ) @entity131 supermodel @entity130 ( left ) made a rare style misstep and went all - out with aggressively purple hair and black crochet at @entity136 's @entity4 pop - up yesterday complex knotted hair styles were enough to put princess @entity140 's braided buns to shame , and washed out ombre hues were about as tired as the peace signs which sprouted from the fists of every woman who realized she was having her photo taken			2
even stylist - armed celebrities failed to side - step their share of festival fashion disasters			0
@entity131 supermodel @entity130 went all - out with aggressively purple hair and black crochet , while @entity151 's overload on chunky gold accessories rendered her reminiscent of a swashbuckling pirate who had just looted a treasure chest			1
the second instalment of @entity4 , which attracted nearly 580,000 attendees last year and grossed a record - breaking $ 78.3 million , kicks off on april 17			0
this woman ( left ) could n't have picked a more unflattering pair of high - waisted ankle - flappers , while teaming a hippy skirt with dowdy white sandals ( right ) just looked @entity162 - ish on another festival - goer three musketeers : @entity151 's overload on chunky gold accessories rendered her reminiscent of a swashbuckling pirate who had just looted a treasure chest ( left ) , and neither @entity168 ( center ) nor @entity170 ( right ) fared much better on the style stakes @entity173 's @entity172 at @entity174 crop it like it 's hot visit site @entity4 seems to be the one place where @entity151 lets loose in terms of her style and is open to experimenting ; she just wants to fit in with her @entity182 - ation ! the catwalk strutter has a flair for festival fashion , and she always pulls out all of the stops at this annual @entity188 music festival			1
take this gypsy style outfit which comprises of an off - shoulder white crop top and flowing black maxi skirt with thigh splits , tied together with a statement waist belt			2
the top is by @entity173 â€™s @entity172 and is the perfect take on summer bohemian vibes			0
styled with everything and anything from denim cut offs and brown boots to maxi skirts and sandals , this off - shoulder top will set pulses races however you wear it			0
and the best part is that it 's attainable for us mere mortals ; it 's only $ 88 at @entity174 , so hurry up and buy it with a click to the right before it sells out			0
she 's a normal teen at heart ! if you want to emulate @entity151 's look for even less , take a gander at the style edit below at our top picks from the likes of @entity223 , @entity224 , and more			1
re : named @entity225 visit site @entity228 - the - @entity227 visit site guess off - the - @entity230 at @entity231 's visit site @entity233 visit site flower crowns ( left ) proved to be a craze that has stubbornly refused to die , while less mainstream trends like the belly - dancer ensemble ( right ) also cropped up the clash : @entity94 ( left ) strutted around yesterday in a turquoise paint - splattered maxi - dress , and @entity97 ( right ) teamed a metallic gold bikini top with a pair of patchwork denim dungarees and a bright orange bomber jacket complex knotted hair styles were enough to put princess @entity140 's braided buns to shame , and washed out ombre hues were about as tired as the peace signs which sprouted from the fists of every woman who realized she was having her photo taken as a rule of thumb , if you feel the need to literally advertise your outfit as ' fly ' , it probably is n't ( left ) and matching ombre hair with an ombre garment is just far too much ombre for one human ( right ) the countless bejewelled headpieces that adorned the foreheads of festival revellers this year were one of @entity4 's more pervasive trends			1

in the searing @entity13 heat , many jumped on the chance to shed most of their clothes
string monokinis and skimpy leotards were spotted at every turn
