yes , they can do it on a cold night at @entity2 ? perhaps it was n't an emphatic performance by @entity5 - but that does n't matter in the @entity7			1
following their heroics at @entity11 on sunday , @entity9 's side had to raise themselves for the less glamorous surroundings of @entity13 or face being on the end of a shock defeat			1
@entity5 striker @entity16 celebrates after scoring the winner with an instinctive finish on 19 minutes @entity16 fired in a first - time finish after the ball fell to him following @entity22 's run into the box @entity5 team - mates rush to congratulate @entity16 as they head into the fourth round of the @entity7 with a 1 - 0 victory against @entity13 @entity13 : @entity27 6 , @entity28 6 , @entity29 6.5 , @entity30 6 , @entity31 6 , @entity32 6 , @entity33 6 ( @entity34 6 , 63 ' ) , @entity35 6 ( @entity36 6.5 , 55 ' ) , @entity37 6 , @entity38 , @entity39 6 ( @entity40 82 ' )			1

however , @entity9 has more unwanted questions to find answers to as the injury concerns pile - up for the @entity71			2
@entity78 missed wednesday night 's clash with an adductor injury that is expected to keep him out for the next four weeks			0
and no sooner had the club confirmed the @entity84 's absence , they were facing up to a central midfield crisis after @entity54 limped off on the stroke of half - time 's with a hamstring injury			2
with key defender @entity90 also due to miss the next four weeks with a hamstring strain , the injury problems are piling up for @entity9			2
' the injuries are a big negative because we already have injuries			0
i spoke with @entity54 and [ @entity97 ] @entity55 and we said they would play 45 minutes each - if only @entity54 could hold on for 12 more seconds			2
' @entity54 is a hamstring , so he will be out for four or five weeks			0
' the problem we have is in our numbers			0
we have good youngsters but we do n't want to put too much on them			0
' we can handle it at the moment , but one or two more injuries we might have to look at it			0
i 'll talk to the club			0
' @entity13 manager @entity48 ( left ) shakes hands with his @entity5 counterpart @entity9 ahead of kick - off the @entity5 players form a huddle under the floodlights at @entity2 before the @entity7 third round replay @entity116 thought he had opened the scoring for @entity13 before the goal was correctly ruled out for offside the @entity13 midfielder was midway through his goal celebration before realising his strike had been ruled out @entity5 's @entity56 ( right ) is muscled off the ball by @entity39 ( centre ) of @entity13 during the first - half @entity36 was released by @entity5 aged 16 due to a ‘ lack of physical development ’			1
six years later , the @entity13 defender is 6ft 5in and he came on to face his former club			0
on his side 's display , @entity9 added : ' i 'm proud of them , it was a serious performance from us , it was difficult and a typical @entity137 cup game			1
' @entity5 , though , were handed an almighty fright inside the opening five minutes , @entity138 racing clear of the @entity5 backline to slide the ball under @entity49 , only for the effort to ruled offside			0
but that was the highlight for the home side as @entity5 cruised to victory after @entity16 finished off a good move involving @entity50 , @entity58 and @entity22 in the 19th minute			1
@entity13 keeper @entity27 can only watch as @entity16 's shot fires past him to open the scoring for the @entity152 side the @entity154 international punches the air in celebration after giving @entity5 a first - half lead @entity5 captain @entity51 ( 3rd left ) embraces @entity16 as @entity13 defenders return to the centre circle with their heads dipped the goal took the wind out of the @entity13 ' sails			1
the intensity and exuberance of their early play vanished as the @entity152 side asserted their authority with such ruthlessness			0
@entity13 rarely threatened @entity49 after @entity16 's decisive striker as @entity5 - led by the excellent @entity51 - nullified the home side 's threat to set up a fourth round tie against @entity175			1
one chance , one goal			0
that 's what happens in the @entity152 - and @entity13 found out to their detriment			1
a tame @entity39 header was all @entity13 had to show for their second half performance , which was full of work - rate - but woefully short on quality			1
' the game was a damp squib , we were okay until they scored and then they killed the game , ' admitted @entity13 manager @entity48			2
' we wanted it to be a rip roaring cup tie , but they did n't let it happen			0
they are a damn good side			0
there 's no shame in losing to @entity5			2
