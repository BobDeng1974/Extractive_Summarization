it is not a match to decide the title , as has been the case in earlier seasons			0
but the @entity6 derby this sunday still holds great significance for both clubs , managers and , of course , supporters			1
@entity12 have won the last four contests between the sides , as well as the previous three at @entity15			1
a number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time			2
here @entity19 assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers			0
can @entity22 survive a derby loss ? the word is the @entity26 ’s future will be decided come may when the dust on a creaking season has settled			1
defeat to cross-town rivals would push chairman @entity29 closer to pressing the termination button though			2
it would leave @entity12 trailing united by four points and likely to finish fourth , needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to @entity34 – the very minimum requirement			1
@entity22 ( centre ) is a man under - pressure at @entity12 and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable who needs the win more ? to that end you would probably have to say @entity12			1
a victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation , and reignite ambitions to finish second , possible saving @entity22 from the axe			1
@entity54 look set to finish in the top four regardless , the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory			1
but they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours			0
@entity54 have never lost five in a row to @entity12 before			1
three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed			0
@entity62 ( right ) tormented @entity12 at @entity63 as they dropped out of the @entity65 title race would victory dispel any lingering doubts about @entity68 ? quite likely			1
three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity12 would underline @entity68 ’s ability to rise to the big matches and suggest that , after a season of trial , error , and turnstile selections , the plan is coming together			2
those uncertainties around the @entity83 would resurface just as swiftly with defeat of course			0
@entity68 has had his critics this season but @entity54 's performances are proving them wrong should @entity89 remain in the @entity12 side ? it would be a big call for a game of such size , but the sense that @entity12 may be better off without their captain can not be disregarded			1
these should be the 29 - year - old ’s peak years but injuries seem to have affected his body and mind			0
the @entity102 is increasingly prone to errors of judgement			0
@entity105 and @entity106 do not provide the most robust competition but @entity89 ’s appearance in seven losses in 12 games speaks volumes			0
@entity106 , on the bench against @entity113 , has experienced three losses in 24 matches all season			0
@entity89 ( left ) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby where does this rank in @entity125 football ’s biggest games ? @entity6 has become a powerhouse of @entity125 football through @entity12 ’s ascent			1
the city has been home to the @entity65 title for the past four seasons , oscillating between @entity15 and the @entity133			2
that will not be the case this year but the rivalry still burns and allied to the global scale of these clubs the match ranks as high as any other , perhaps only beaten by @entity140			0
@entity141 ( centre ) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at @entity15 who is the better player right now : @entity147 or @entity148 ? no doubt @entity148 is the better striker , his movement , angles for shooting , and goal - scoring record stands testament to that			1
but since being shifted to his preferred centre - forward role , @entity147 is displaying form that would see him into any side			1
he has been approaching his all - action peak and scored seven goals in ten games for club and country , taking his overall season tally to 21			0
@entity148 has 23 for the campaign , but has failed to find the net in his last six games , a run stretching back to february 24			2
at the moment you would have to go for @entity147			2
these two love the @entity173			0
@entity147 holds the record for most all - time goals with 11 , while @entity148 has six in seven			1
@entity147 ( left ) and @entity148 are two of the best forwards in the current @entity65 how crucial might @entity177 be ? his return to the @entity54 lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably			1
he has not enjoyed the best returns facing @entity12 in recent seasons – and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre - back as a first - half substitute – but will get more space in his deeper midfield role			1
it is unlikely @entity22 will task anyone with marshalling @entity177 , which is how he likes it			2
@entity177 ( left ) has become a key player for @entity54 over the years and is pivotal for @entity68 will the real @entity196 show up ? you would hope so			2
@entity196 at the height of his powers in an awesome sight and could prove the difference			0
but those flashes have been all too fleeting this season			0
now would be a good time to step up			0
like @entity89 , @entity196 's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against @entity113 on monday will @entity54 solve the problem of @entity208 ? the team looks balanced right now , with @entity210 doing nothing to lose his place			1
@entity54 ’s record signing has been coming on and providing assists , so @entity68 is probably inclined to repeat the pattern			2
ultimately , @entity216 must provide more , and will want to , but at this moment he should start on the bench			0
why is kick - off at 4pm ? police saw no dangers of the late afternoon kick - off time on a sunday , and have cited previous good behaviour between sets of supporters			0
as ever , television dictates the preference and the 4pm slot is prime for viewers			0
@entity208 has n't quite settled in @entity6 but recently has done well when coming off the bench			1

the @entity6 derby is crucial in the race for the @entity65 top two
under - pressure @entity22 ca n't afford to lose the clash
the performances of @entity148 and @entity147 will be important
@entity54 can open up a four - point *gap* if they beat their bitter rivals
