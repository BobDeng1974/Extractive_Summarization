by @entity1 reporter published : 18:06 est , 2 august 2012 updated : 18:06 est , 2 august 2012 @entity2 has launched another attack on @entity4 , arguing that the president is anti-business and has run out of ideas to boost the struggling economy			1
the @entity9 candidate , who has just returned from a trip to @entity11 , said mr @entity4 was ' like a dog trying to chase its tail ' in his economic policies during a speech on thursday in @entity16 , @entity17			1
while the president was campaigning hundreds of miles away in @entity20 , mr @entity2 's message followed him there as his campaign put up billboards criticising his controversial statement that small business owners are not responsible for their own success			1
mr @entity4 was greeted with ads from mr @entity2 featuring entrepreneurs with the message : ' mr president , i built my business			1
' attack : @entity2 once again criticised the president 's approach to economic growth in a @entity17 speech counter-attack : mr @entity4 is accusing mr @entity2 of trying to reduce his own tax rate @entity39 : this campaign ad takes aim at mr @entity4 's claims that small business owners rely on others the president fired back with a claim that the @entity9 candidate supports ' trickle - down fairy dust ' that has been shown not to improve the economy , and summarised mr @entity2 's tax plans in a scathing television ad : ' he pays less			1
' for mr @entity2 , thursday saw a return to domestic campaigning after a weeklong overseas trip			2
he is expected to announce his running mate soon , but the former @entity58 governor gave no indication during the day that he has made a decision			0
instead , he unveiled a plan for more jobs and more take - home pay , coupled with a self - generated report card that said @entity58 enjoyed better economic times when he was governor than the nation has under mr @entity4			1
mr @entity2 said his economic policies would lead to the creation of 12million jobs over the first four years , and help make @entity71 energy - independent			1
he pledged to expand international trade , particularly with @entity73 , and vowed to confront @entity74 over its own policies			0
star - studded : mr @entity2 appeared with ten @entity9 governors at an event in @entity79 , @entity17 say cheese : the president posed with a group of children at a restaurant in @entity85 , @entity20 on thursday ' i 'm finally going to sit down with the @entity74 and they 're going to understand that if they cheat there are going to be consequences , because we 're not going to let them walk all over us , ' mr @entity2 said			1
he said he would help small business owners , improve the education system and cut spending to reduce the deficit , but he offered relatively few specifics			0
mr @entity2 has previously he wants to extend the tax cuts due to expire on december 31 and grant a new 20 per cent cut in tax rates in addition to stimulate growth			2
he has also said he will reverse some of mr @entity4 's proposed defence cuts , and simultaneously reduce spending on other programmes in a way that deficits would gradually subside			1
but he has so far refused to identify which existing tax breaks he would curtail to accomplish his goals , and generally avoided naming individual programmes he wants to cut or eliminate			0
in his remarks during the day , mr @entity2 said he wants federal education funds that aid the disadvantaged and disabled to be tied to the student rather than flow to school districts , as is now the case			2
but he did not specify how much he would cut from them to achieve his goal of reducing federal deficits			0
he criticised mr @entity4 for signing legislation that cut $ 500billion from @entity119 over a decade			2
but he did not say whether he would restore the funds , and he has spoken favourably in the past of a @entity123 - passed budget that left the reductions in place			0
crowd : the @entity9 candidate climbed on a table to address a throng of supporters at a fairground hungry for victory : mr @entity2 boarded his campaign aeroplane with a bag of @entity136 's in hand in his comments , mr @entity2 said @entity139 have a different view			1
' they think we should just raise taxes , ' he said			0
' the problem is when you raise taxes you lower growth			0
' mr @entity4 's approach is ' like a dog trying to chase its tail , you just do n't ever get there , ' he added			2
' so the right answer is not to raise taxes			0
the right answer is to cut taxes and cut spending			0
' for the second day in a row , mr @entity4 cited a study by the nonpartisan @entity157 that says mr @entity2 and other millionaires would receive a tax cut of approximately $ 250,000 a year if the former @entity58 governor gets his way			1
' this analysis also found that if governor @entity2 wants to keep his word ' about reducing deficits , ' the average middle - class family with children would be stuck with a tax increase of more than $ 2,000 , ' he added			0
the president 's new campaign ad was delivering the same highly personalised message			0
it says that mr @entity2 has paid a lower proportion of his income in taxes than many people of lesser means and adds : ' he pays less , you pay more			1
' mr @entity2 's personal wealth has been estimated as high as $ 250million , but he has not so far made public any detailed disclosure of his holdings			2
the @entity9 rolled out his own new ad , giving a less - than - warm welcome to mr @entity4 on a day @entity183 touched down in @entity20			1
it notes that the state still suffers from high unemployment , record home foreclosures and an increase in poverty			0
' @entity4 : what a disappointment , ' it says .			0
