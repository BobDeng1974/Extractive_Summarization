by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 01:55 est , 19 september 2012 mobile phones have become an integral part of going to a gig , with instagram , @entity5 and other services overloaded with gig pictures , while waving phones about has become the modern equivalent of holding a candle aloft			1
however , @entity12 musician @entity11 has taken things one step further , and created an app which becomes part of the show			1
the musician , currently on tour in the @entity12 , can remotely control the phone screen , changing its colour and background in time to the music			1
' when i first started performing “ @entity36 ” ( a piece of chamber music where the audience are the performers and given written out instructions as notation ) a few years ago i included several uses of cell phone interaction for the audience , ' he said			0
' the results really pleased me and also seemed to really engage the audience			0
' i thought more and more about how we are living in a time where much of the concert going audience has smart phones , that are basically computers , that can be used as both sound making machines and lighting devices			2
' the thought of an audience being the light and the sound source for a show became one of my main goals			0
' however , the team struggled to make the idea work , as most music venues do not have wifi networks			0
instead , they decided to use audio			0
' @entity68 , the main programmer , had the genius idea to use audio to communicate to the phones and create ' calibration tones ' that would unlock the apps inner working and make it possible for us to communicate from the stage with all the apps running in the audience			1
the free app syncs all the smartphones in the room to create a light show , in a similar way to @entity86 ’s led wristbands			0
the handset can also be programmed to ' play along ' to the music			2
audio tones ' hidden ' in the music control the smartphone screens , display colours and creating patterns .			1

@entity12 musician @entity11 uses *custom* app to display colours and play sounds of concert goers mobile phones
app is controlled by *special* audio tones in the music being played on stage
