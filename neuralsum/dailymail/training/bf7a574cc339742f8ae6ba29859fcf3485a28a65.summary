rocketing global rates of stroke among the young and middle - aged are a ‘ wake - up call ’ , say @entity5 experts			1
in the past 20 years the number of strokes afflicting people aged 20 to 64 have jumped by a quarter , an international study shows			1
strokes in this age group now make up 31 per cent of the worldwide total , compared with 25 per cent before 1990			2
warning : the number of strokes in the past 20 years have jumped by a quarter although the rate of strokes among older people is declining in the @entity5 , @entity5 are still more likely to die from stroke than someone living in @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity22			1
in the poorest areas of the @entity5 the number of people dying from stroke is around three times higher than in the least economically deprived			1
@entity27 , chief executive of the @entity28 , called the study a ‘ wake - up call to governments across the globe ’			0
poor lifestyles , increasing sedentary habits , obesity and diabetes threatened to eradicate advances made in @entity5 in recent years , he warned			0
figures from @entity39 earlier this month revealed a 40 per cent fall in stroke rates among elderly people since the mid- 1990s			1
experts said the drop was due to better treatment of high blood pressure and cholesterol			1
but rates remain high for people aged 45 and under , and those of black @entity51 and @entity52 origin , and a drop in the total number of strokes is unlikely because more people are living longer			1
the latest findings , published in @entity59 medical journal , form part of the @entity61 , looking at major diseases and causes of ill health in 50 countries			0
the results reveal stark differences between rich and poor			0
relentless : @entity69 presenter @entity68 , 54 , suffered a stroke , which he blamed on his relentless schedule strokes were linked to 46 per cent more disability and illness and 42 per cent more deaths in poorer countries than in richer ones between 1990 and 2010			2
in rich countries , stroke rates fell 12 per cent over the two decades			2
lifestyle factors such as smoking , high blood pressure and unhealthy diet were thought to play a role in increasing stroke rates in low - to - middle income countries			1
professor @entity87 of @entity89 ’s @entity88 and @entity90 said : ‘ the worldwide stroke burden is growing very fast and there is now an urgent need for culturally acceptable and affordable stroke prevention , management and rehabilitation strategies to be developed and implemented worldwide			2
’ each year around 152,000 strokes occur in the @entity5 , costing the @entity98 an estimated £ 3.7billion , and there are over a million @entity5 living with the effects of stroke			1
in january , @entity69 presenter @entity68 , 54 , suffered a stroke , which he blamed on his relentless schedule			0
mr @entity27 said at least half of strokes could be prevented by simple lifestyle changes , such as taking more exercise			0
‘ the report reveals a shocking disparity between rich and poor , where death rates from stroke are up to ten times higher in lower income countries , ’ he said			0
‘ closer to home , within the @entity5 , the number of people dying from stroke is around three times higher in the most economically deprived areas , compared to the least deprived			2
‘ stroke survivors often face a black hole when discharged from hospital , with one in five in the @entity5 receiving no support from services to help them recover			0
‘ this is a stark warning			0
we urgently need to address this global stroke crisis by prioritising stroke prevention and investment into stroke research			0
’ a second study published in @entity130 showed that in 2010 , three - fifths of the global disability and more than half of deaths due to stroke were from bleeding in the brain			0
this type of stroke , known as a haemorrhagic stroke , is deadlier than more common ischaemic strokes that cut blood supply to the brain .			1

people aged 20 to 64 suffering strokes jumped by a quarter
*britons* more likely to die from stroke than someone living in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22
smoking , high blood pressure and unhealthy diet increases risk
