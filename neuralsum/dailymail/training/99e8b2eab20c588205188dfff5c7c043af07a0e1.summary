by @entity0 and @entity1 created 9:21 pm on 8th october 2011 @entity2 has ordered a crackdown on thousands of families with youngsters diagnosed with ‘ naughty child syndrome ’ who get new cars paid for by the state			1
the @entity10 has been shocked to learn that the families of more than 3,000 people suffering @entity13 ( @entity13 ) are believed to have been given vehicles under the £ 1.5 billion - a - year @entity16 scheme			1
mr @entity2 is determined to stop what he regards as abuse of free cars for the disabled as part of his campaign to curb the @entity24 ’s annual £ 192billion benefits bill			1
luxury : the £ 35,000 @entity26 , which claimants can get through @entity16 with a top - up payment of £ 9,000 the number of people with cars paid for by the government - funded @entity16 scheme has soared to 575,000 – up by 200,000 in just over ten years			1
the number of claimants receiving disability benefit for @entity13 – or hyperkinetic disorder , as it is categorised by welfare officials – has rocketed from 800 a decade ago to 43,100 last year			0
an additional 55,900 claimants are given handouts for ‘ behavioural disorders ’ , taking the total for @entity13 - related conditions to 99,000			1
it has led to claims that a lack of proper checks has led to widespread abuse			1
mr @entity2 was enraged to be told initially by his department that there were no precise numbers on how many people with the condition received free cars			1
determined : secretary of state for work and pensions @entity2 however , after persistent enquiries by @entity58 , officials finally revealed that 3,200 such claimants qualified			1
@entity16 was launched in 1978 with a handful of specially modified cars , such as motorised blue three - wheel trikes and @entity63 with a ramp at the back for a wheelchair			1
but now it is the biggest fleet - management outfit in the @entity24			0
@entity69 , its chief executive , earns £ 1.17 million a year			0
its website openly advises claimants how to use the benefit to get luxury cars such as a £ 30,000 @entity76 , a £ 35,000 @entity26 or a £ 37,000 @entity77			2
some doctors believe the big rise in the number of children said to have @entity13 is a direct result of their parents ’ right to claim disability benefit of up to £ 10,000 a year			2
while critics believe @entity13 is just a label to describe restless or naughty children , psychologists insist it is a real condition which applies when a child is persistently restless , to the point where it has a detrimental effect on their development			0
some adults are also affected			0
the government says that about a third of a million children aged between six and 16 suffer with the disorder			0
original : the blue three - wheeler @entity16 first offered disabled people @entity13 was almost unheard of 20 years ago , but the number of prescriptions for @entity102 – the controversial drug which suppresses symptoms – has rocketed from 2,000 in 1991 to close to 350,000			1
@entity16 claims are processed by the work and @entity107 as part of the £ 12 billion - a - year @entity109 ( @entity109 )			1
successful claimants are handed over to @entity16 , which supplies the cars			1
in more than seven out of ten cases people who get @entity109 receive it for life , with no more questions asked			2
@entity109 is divided into two elements – ‘ care ’ , worth up to £ 294 a month , and ‘ mobility ’ , worth an additional handout of up to £ 205 a month			2
spoiled for choice : @entity16 's website has a number of cars on offer to get the mobility element , families of sufferers must prove they need ‘ guidance or supervision most of the time from another person when walking out of doors in unfamiliar places ’			1
they can either spend it themselves on transport , or have it paid direct to @entity16 to provide a lease car			1
the £ 205 benefit is enough to cover the full monthly cost of cars such as a @entity143 or a @entity144 on a three - year lease			0
however , it is not means - tested			0
if better - off claimants want a bigger or more luxurious car , they can supplement the grant with their own cash			2
for example , they can get a £ 35,000 @entity26 by handing over a top - up payment of £ 9,000			0
after three years , they get another new car			0
a claimant whose child has been diagnosed with @entity13 can download a claim form which they can either post or submit online			0
they must set out the reasons why they should receive @entity109 – for instance , because they have trouble dressing themselves or using the lavatory			1
they should also explain why they qualify for the ‘ mobility ’ element			0
according to advice on a @entity175 website , this would include ‘ physical problems when walking out of doors ’ and ‘ needing someone with them when out of doors in unfamiliar places			0
you may , for example , need help to cross the road or avoid obstacles			0
’ the claim should be backed up by a doctor ’s reference			0
more than half of claims are approved without further checks			0
once accepted , the claimant completes an online application at a car showroom			0
@entity16 confirms with the @entity196 that the claim has been approved before providing a car which suits the claimant ’s needs			1
more than 11,000 of the cars obtained via @entity16 are high - end models such as @entity203 and @entity204			1
in the past year , when many people have been forced to sell their cars or buy second - hand because of the recession , the number of @entity16 cars on the road has risen by 35,000			2
some car dealers have promoted the @entity16 scheme to claimants ’ relatives by assuring them that they can keep the car at a separate address and use it for personal commuting and family trips without @entity175 investigators finding out			1
a total of 200,000 of the cars are used by the disabled person ’s friends or relatives			2
@entity16 ’s website features reviews by @entity229 ? magazine			2
the £ 35,000 @entity26 is described as ‘ striking a fine balance between comfort and agility			0
the cabin is classy and spacious ’ ; the £ 30,000 @entity76 is ‘ refined and has a luxurious , spacious interior ’			0
last night a senior @entity236 source said : ‘ we are determined to crack down on the spiralling disability benefit bill , stamp out abuses and increase the transparency of the system			2
’ a @entity16 spokeswoman said : ‘ the objective of the @entity16 scheme is to offer mobility and independence to all customers			1
‘ this requires a wide range of cars , adaptations and wheelchair - accessible vehicles , so that customers have access to vehicles and adaptations that suit their individual circumstances , taking account of their conditions			0

lack of checks means *programme* set up to help the disabled is open to abuse
@entity2 determined to crack down on claimants who take advantage of the system
last *sunday* we said some 3,200 families of children with @entity272 were believed to have been given cars under the @entity16 scheme . in fact that total is the *combined* figure for two categories of **recipients** of the @entity281 component of the @entity109 and includes other behavioural disorders . **recipients** choose whether or not to spend their *allowance* on a @entity16 car ; *generally* about 30 per cent do so . also , we described the qualification for the @entity290 component , rather than the @entity281 component required to claim a car , for which individuals must be *declared* virtually unable to walk .
