by @entity0 injuries : mother - of - three @entity2 , of @entity3 , thought she was going to die after the attack an academic today revealed her miraculous survival - and how she has been scarred for life - after a stag impaled her throat with its antlers			1
@entity2 thought she would die after being gored in @entity10 in the @entity11 , which saw doctors put her into an induced coma and perform two operations on her windpipe			1
medical experts said the 44 - year - old @entity19 electronics researcher was lucky not to have been paralysed from the neck down			1
dr @entity21 said : ‘ it 's a miracle i survived - especially when you consider that if a car hits a stag , the car 's usually a write - off			1
but i believe it was part of my path in life - and part of that path was that i survived			2
i suppose i could wallow in what 's happened , feel sorry for myself and ask “ why me ? ” , but i do n't see the point			2
' dr @entity21 was holidaying at the end of last year when a startled stag charged towards her			1
it knocked her over , impaling her throat			2
she added : ‘ i was never attacked			0
the stag got spooked , ran and i just happened to be in the way			2
i did n't feel any pain , but looked down and saw a lot of blood and i was gurgling and struggling to breathe			0
my initial thought was i was going to die - but on reflection it was probably more traumatic for my friends , watching and helpless , than it was for me			1
’ within 40 minutes , she was off to hospital in @entity49			2
she was then airlifted to be treated by specialists at @entity51 in @entity52			0
the antler had gone through dr @entity21 ’s airway , fractured her neck , smashed her throat , damaged the nerves to her vocal cords , carried on through her oesophagus and hit her spine			1
but it stopped just short of her spinal cord , which was something of a miracle considering it almost severed a main artery , which would have caused dr @entity21 to bleed to death			1
a fraction deeper and there was a chance she would have been paralysed from the neck down			1
doctors put dr @entity21 into a coma and operated on her windpipe			1
she added : ‘ i woke up a week later - but i was n't myself until about a week after that			0
’ close : a fraction deeper and there was a chance she would have been paralysed from the neck down dr @entity21 , who has three children , said that the worst thing was the mental experience rather than the physical recovery			1
she added : ‘ people think when you wake up from a coma , you go straight back to normal			2
but i had crazy hallucinations which carried on after i woke up			2
in fact , it took over a week for me to get sane again			0
’ her vivid hallucinations morphed voices and sounds she could hear on the ward into characters and scenarios in her head and she became trapped in a world which blended the fictional with the real			1
she added : ‘ it was a very scary and dark time			0
like a recurring bad dream			0
i was acting like a crazy person , trying to reach out to touch and talk to people who were n't there			2
‘ i felt like i was losing my mind - and my sister thought i was going nuts			2
all sorts of bizarre stuff was going on , from surgeons trying to replace my brain to @entity111 hiding in the toilet			0
’ fortunate : medics said the electronics researcher was lucky not to have been paralysed from the neck down as the strong painkillers wore off , dr @entity21 began to come round			1
but months later she still finds herself haunted by the bizarre ' trips '			0
' it was a very scary and dark time			0
like a recurring bad dream			0
i was acting like a crazy person , trying to reach out to touch and talk to people who were n't there ' @entity2 on her hallucinations ‘ i have flashbacks and nightmares , ’ said dr @entity21 , who spent much of her recovery at her sister @entity128 's home in @entity129			1
‘ people think i made a miraculous recovery - and physically i did			0
but the mental scars will take a lot longer to heal			0
’ after her initial operations , dr @entity21 had to learn to walk , talk , write and even eat again			1
but it was a welcome challenge for the child of a continent - hopping engineer father , who spent her younger years ‘ in the company of bears in @entity144 , with monkeys in the garden in @entity147 or having picnics in the @entity150 desert ’			0
‘ i faced it head on , ’ she said			0
‘ when the doctors said they were transferring me to the ward , i was determined i 'd walk out with my head held high , rather than be wheeled in a chair			1
location : dr @entity21 was holidaying in @entity10 , a remote hamlet in the @entity11 , at the end of last year when a startled stag charged towards her			1
the incident happened near the gate ( pictured ) ‘ the first day , i needed three people to help me out of bed			2
i took two steps on the spot , then vomited			0
the following day , i walked the length of the ward			0
it took all my strength but i was determined			0
' my initial thought was i was going to die - but on reflection it was probably more traumatic for my friends , watching and helpless , than it was for me ' dr @entity21 on the incident itself ‘ with my voice , i got vowel sounds back initially , then had to learn how to breathe when speaking			1
even now my voice is still croaky			0
but every time something came back , it was like being given a gift			0
‘ it 's only after losing the things you take for granted that you realise how lucky you are			2
’ until just a few weeks ago , @entity21 stoneneeded to be fed through a nasogastric tube , but the dedicated vegan is now back on solids			1
she has lost a stone , but claims she is back to her ' perfect weight '			0
last week , dr @entity21 returned to living and working at her print company @entity191 in @entity3 , which she continued to run from her hospital bed - holding conference calls on @entity195 .			1
