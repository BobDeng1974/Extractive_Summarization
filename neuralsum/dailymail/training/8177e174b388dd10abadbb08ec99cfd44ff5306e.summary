by @entity0 published : 18:36 est , 13 november 2013 updated : 18:38 est , 13 november 2013 pressure : a new report had said that the 111 helpline is increasing pressure on healthcare services the @entity8 helpline could be putting even more pressure on @entity11 units - despite being set up to reduce the number of patients turning up at casualty , research has shown			1
a government - commissioned study found that in some areas the helpline led to an extra 400 patients and an additional 600 ambulance call - outs every month			1
research by academics at the @entity22 , published in the @entity23 , looked at four areas where the helpline was introduced in 2011 and compared the number of patients going to @entity11 and ambulance call - outs a year later			1
they found in @entity30 , it led to an extra 400 patients showing up in @entity11 every month – an increase of 6 per cent – while there was a 5 per cent rise in @entity35 , which worked out as an additional 200 patients a month			1
the study also found that in @entity39 and @entity40 nearly 1,000 extra patients turned up in urgent care centres every month , an increase of 8 per cent compared to the previous year			1
and in @entity30 the centres , which are usually located within normal @entity11 units , treated 900 extra people a month			2
the introduction of the helpline also led to an increase in 999 call - outs of between 6 and 11 per cent in all the areas being looked at – in @entity51 this worked out as 650 more a month			1
@entity8 111 was rolled out this spring to give patients round - the - clock medical advice over the phone			2
the government launched the helpline to replace @entity58 out - of - hours numbers and the @entity61 helpline			2
but the study concluded that in its first year , @entity8 111 ‘ did not deliver the expected system benefits of reducing calls to the 999 ambulance service or shifting patients to urgent rather than emergency care ’			1
it is manned by call centre workers with just six weeks ' training - who according to experts have been sending patients to @entity11 and calling out ambulances unnecessarily			2
concerns have also been raised that patients who are not put through to a doctor or nurse hang up in frustration and end up going to casualty anyway			0
call centre : operators are given just six weeks ' training before giving out medical advice over the phone but the @entity85 said the study did not reflect how the helpline is now performing because it only looked at a few areas that had been involved in the pilot			1
and yesterday the @entity8 ’s top doctor insisted that the helpline would be a solution to the crisis in @entity11 , saying it would let patients speak to doctors and nurses rather than going to their nearest casualty			0
professor sir @entity98 , the medical director of @entity99 , said he intends to beef - up the @entity8 helpline by hiring more doctors and nurses			0
he also announced a major shake - up of @entity11 departments , introducing the idea of a two - tier system			0
this would see about half of @entity109 dealing with heart attacks , strokes and serious injuries with the remainder treating less critical patients			0
the plans will also see @entity116 offering more same - day appointments and opening their surgeries at evenings and weekends to reduce the need for patients to go to @entity11			2
but the idea has already run into controversy , with critics saying the new system will only end up confusing patients			0
@entity127 ’s health spokesman @entity126 said : ‘ 2013 has been the worst year in a decade in @entity11			0
it is a crisis of @entity130 ’s own making			0
‘ it is clear that his decision to scrap @entity61 and replace nurses with call handlers has added to the pressure on @entity11			0

in some areas , the service is leading to 400 extra patients a month
it also *prompts* as many as 600 extra emergency call - outs
figures were revealed by @entity22 academics
but @entity85 said the study was too *selective*
