@entity0 today makes his most powerful political intervention since leaving @entity2 by launching an outspoken attack on ‘ the problem within @entity5 ’			1
the former prime minister addresses the shocking killing of drummer @entity8 in @entity9 by going further than he – or any front - rank @entity11 politician – has gone before over the issue of @entity5 radicalism			2
writing in today ’s @entity14 , he departs from the usual argument that @entity5 is a peaceful religion that should not be tainted by the actions of a few extremists			2
@entity19 view : @entity0 says that @entity5 extremism is more widespread than most politicians admit instead , mr @entity0 urges governments to ‘ be honest ’ and admit that the problem is more widespread			1
‘ there is a problem within @entity5 – from the adherents of an ideology which is a strain within @entity5 , ’ he writes			1
‘ we have to put it on the table and be honest about it			1
of course there are @entity35 extremists and @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 ones			2
but i am afraid this strain is not the province of a few extremists			0
it has at its heart a view about religion and about the interaction between religion and politics that is not compatible with pluralistic , liberal , open - minded societies			0
’ he adds : ‘ at the extreme end of the spectrum are terrorists , but the world view goes deeper and wider than it is comfortable for us to admit			0
so by and large we do n’t admit it			0
’ mr @entity0 ’s comments are likely to be seized on by critics who will argue that by leading us into the @entity57 he has helped to swell support for radical @entity5 around the globe			1
outspoken : the former prime minister addresses the shocking killing of drummer @entity8 , pictured , by going further than he - or any front - rank @entity11 politician - has gone before over the issue of @entity5 radicalism the @entity65 ’s remarks come as @entity66 prepares to make a @entity68 statement about the @entity9 murder tomorrow afternoon			1
the statement will come just hours after the first meeting of the prime minister ’s @entity71 and @entity73 ( @entity74 ) – made up of senior ministers , @entity76 , police and moderate religious leaders – tomorrow morning			0
@entity80 sources said that it would be a ‘ preliminary meeting ’ to draw up the agenda for a full meeting within days			0

mr @entity66 ’s commons speech is also expected to address the situation in @entity91			1
in his article , mr @entity0 , who is trying to establish a @entity93 state through his work as a peace envoy , also addresses the @entity91 situation , warning : ‘ we are at the beginning of this tragedy			1
@entity91 is in a state of accelerating disintegration			0
accused : @entity103 , 22 , left , and @entity104 , 28 , right , have both been charged with the murder of drummer @entity8 , who was killed last month in @entity9 , @entity107 ‘ president @entity108 is brutally pulverising communities hostile to his regime			2
’ mr @entity0 says that ‘ the overwhelming desire of the @entity112 is to stay out of it ’ , which he goes on to describe as ‘ completely understandable ’			1
he suggests that ‘ the problem within @entity5 ’ can start to be tackled by ‘ educating children about faith here and abroad ’			0
sir @entity119 , a former foreign secretary and chairman of the @entity122 , said : ‘ much of what @entity0 says is sensible			1
‘ the @entity5 terrorists who kill people have the silent support of many more in their community who share their ideology , if not their methods			2
‘ but even combined , they represent only a small minority of @entity132 , and we must never forget that			0
‘ however , he appears to be still trying to justify the @entity57 rather than acknowledging that that war provided an unprecedented opportunity for the @entity139 and @entity140 extremists to slaughter so many of their co-religionists			0
