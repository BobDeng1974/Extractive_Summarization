by @entity0 most people would panic and seek immediate medical help if they found an insect living in their body			0
but not one @entity6 student , who was so fascinated by the flea inhabiting her foot that she left it there for two months			1
@entity10 , a student at @entity12 ’s @entity11 , decided to study the creature after she discovered it in her foot			1
a @entity15 researcher found a sand flea ( pictured ) living inside her foot and decided to keep it there for two months while she studied it while it was there , she took regular photos and videos of it , the website @entity21 reports			1
ms @entity10 ’s job at the university involves carrying out research into ways to prevent tungiasis – a skin disease caused by infection with a female flea – in @entity34			1
these sand fleas burrow into the skin of their host where they live and breed			0
they cause the human host to suffer pain and itching and the site of the infestation often becomes infected			0
the only cure is to dig the fleas out of the skin			0
last month it was reported that an @entity49 biologist , dr @entity48 , had lived with a parasitic worm in his mouth for three months ( pictured ) ms @entity10 says that after two months she became ‘ uneasy ’ about the experiment as her foot was itchy and painful and she was struggling to walk			1
as a result , she decided the time had come to remove the flea			2
despite the termination of her experiment , she made an interesting discovery – she found that the fleas most likely mate while inside their human hosts as she only had one flea living inside her foot and it neither laid eggs nor died			1
as a result , she believes it lived in a ‘ waiting state ’ in anticipation of finding a mate			1
ms @entity10 is not the first researcher to have compromised her health for the sake of science			2
last month it was reported that an @entity49 biologist had lived with a parasitic worm in his mouth for three months			0
dr @entity48 , 36 , played host to a @entity80 pulchruma parasite which moved around the fleshy part of his cheeks and lips			0
dr @entity48 consulted a dentist and a surgeon about the issue but neither removed the parasite so he decided to deal with the problem himself			2
he used small forceps to remove the worm from his cheek with the help of his wife			0
he now keeps it in a jar and studies it .			0

@entity10 took regular photos and videos of the flea in her foot
after two months she became ' uneasy ' about the experiment as her foot had become painful and itchy and she was struggling to walk *properly*
at this point , she decided to removed the flea from her foot
she noticed it was alive and had *n't* bred *-* which led her to *suspect* fleas mate inside their hosts or stay in a ' waiting state ' until they find a mate
