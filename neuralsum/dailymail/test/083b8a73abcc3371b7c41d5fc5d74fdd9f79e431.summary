in a quest to be more green , @entity0 says it is investing in @entity3 solar power and preserving @entity5 forests that make environmentally friendly paper			1
the tech giant announced a new focus on using paper from trees harvested under environmentally sound conditions			0
as part of the deal , @entity0 has pledged an unspecified amount of money for a @entity17 - based nonprofit , the @entity16 , to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the @entity20			1
then @entity22 administrator @entity21 , now @entity0 's president for environmental initiatives , has spearheaded the new green focus at the world 's biggest company			2
@entity0 pledged an unspecified amount of money for a @entity17 - based nonprofit , the @entity16 , to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the @entity20			1
in the @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity34 , wetlands , rivers , and upland forest provide refuge for @entity40 salmon , bald eagle , and @entity43 lynx			0
in @entity47 located in southern @entity48 , the high - quality pine savannas and unique plants and flowers have long made this land a conservation priority			0
the @entity16 will resell the land to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees			0
the initiatives come as the tech giant this year met a self - imposed goal of powering all its @entity5 operations with renewable energy to reduce carbon emissions — initiatives that have won high marks from environmental groups			1
on thursday , it 's also promising to use more renewable power overseas , where @entity0 relies heavily on contract manufacturers — and where a top executive acknowledged the company can do more			1
' it 's important to us to tackle climate change everywhere we are , ' @entity21 , @entity0 's vice president for environmental initiatives , told @entity75			2
' when you talk about @entity3 , you 're talking about manufacturing partners			0
' we 're looking to bring the same innovation there			0
' this is the start			0
' the new solar project in @entity3 has a capacity of 40 megawatts , which is smaller than some projects @entity0 has announced in the @entity5			1
by comparison , @entity0 is spending $ 850 million for rights to nearly half the output of a 280 - megawatt solar facility planned for construction south of @entity0 's @entity90 , @entity91 , headquarters			2
that project will produce enough energy to power all of @entity0 's @entity91 offices , a computer center and 52 retail stores			1
still , the @entity3 project will produce more than the amount of energy consumed by @entity0 's 19 corporate offices and 21 retail stores in @entity3 and @entity103 , @entity97 said			1
she added that @entity0 uses renewable energy for 87 percent of the power at its facilities worldwide			1
that figure , however , does n't include substantial power consumption by contract manufacturers			0
with the new project in @entity3 , @entity0 is looking to improve its own operations first			1
' before we go somewhere else and start asking and eventually requiring clean energy , you want to make sure you show folks how to do it , ' said @entity97 , who was @entity5 @entity22 administrator during president @entity119 's first term			1
@entity0 and other tech companies have drawn criticism in the past for use of toxics in manufacturing and data centers powered by electricity from coal			2
but @entity0 's moves away from those practices in recent years have won accolades from groups like @entity133 , which issued a statement praising the @entity3 project thursday			2
@entity97 declined to say how much @entity0 is investing in the @entity3 project , which is being built in partnership with @entity5 energy company @entity137 and four @entity3 firms			1
although @entity3 is known for heavy reliance on coal , its government has set aggressive goals for solar , wind and hydroelectric power			0
meanwhile , @entity0 pledged an unspecified amount of money for a @entity17 - based nonprofit , the @entity16 , to purchase two large tracts of timberland on the @entity20			1
the @entity16 will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in @entity34 and @entity48 — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees			0
@entity159 , the group 's chief executive , said that will protect the forest while keeping it in the hands of private owners who pay taxes and create jobs			0
the @entity16 will resell the land — 36,000 acres of timberland in @entity34 and @entity48 — to commercial interests under legally binding terms that require future owners to preserve the forest and follow environmentally sound principles for cutting and replanting trees			0
@entity159 said he 'll use proceeds from reselling the land to buy and protect additional tracts			2
' @entity0 believes that paper , like energy , can be a renewable resource , ' the pair said in a blog post announceing the deal			1
' so @entity0 is striving to supply 100 percent of the virgin fibers used in its paper and packaging from sustainably managed forests or controlled wood sources			0
' @entity0 wo n't necessarily buy paper made from trees on that land , but @entity97 said the investment will increase the supply of sustainable wood fiber			1
she said the two tracts would produce about half the non-recycled wood fiber used in @entity0 's product packaging last year			2
that would put @entity0 halfway toward its goal of obtaining all its non-recycled paper products from sustainable timber			0
@entity0 would n't say how much paper it uses , but it says two - thirds of its paper packaging comes from recycled material			0
in the last three months of 2014 , @entity0 sold more than 100 million iphones and other gadgets , most in cardboard boxes			0
