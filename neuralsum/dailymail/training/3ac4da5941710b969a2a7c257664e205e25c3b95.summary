by @entity0 one of @entity2 's most important fuel pipelines has been closed today after police discovered a gang of thieves had siphoned off thousands of gallons of diesel in a ' sophisticated ' heist			1
it is believed more than 30,000 litres of diesel may have been taken from the pipeline running from @entity13 's @entity12 in @entity14			1
that would be worth about £ 41,000 ( $ 70,000 ) at pump prices			1
the alarm was raised when the owner of an industrial unit in @entity20 , near where the pipeline passes , discovered a large amount of fuel hidden at the scene			1
a gang of thieves has tapped into one of the country 's main underground fuel pipelines to steal more than 30,000 litres of diesel detectives have arrested two men , aged 32 and 34 , in connection with the thefts			2
today , police were guarding the spot in @entity38 , @entity14 , where the thieves are thought to have tapped into the 14 - inch pipeline			1
the fuel is being stored safely and engineers from the refinery are working to retrieve it , police confirmed			2
the pipeline , known as the @entity47 and owned by @entity13 , is one of the @entity2 's main underground fuel supply routes for gas , diesel , gasoline and jet fuel			1
it runs 130 miles from the @entity13 refinery in @entity12 near @entity56 to the @entity57 and is 14in in diameter			1
the pipeline cost £ 40 million to construct in the mid 1980s and was extended in the 1990s			2
it now runs out to @entity61			0
detectives are today investigating the ' sophisticated ' and ' potentially lethal ' plot to siphon the fuel it has been reported that a similar incident took place recently in @entity68			1
however , oil theft from pipelines is relatively rare in the @entity2 but a major problem in some parts of the world , such as @entity74 where it is estimated to cost the government up to $ 1 billion per month			2
an @entity13 spokesman : ' @entity13 is assisting @entity78 with their enquiries following the discovery of a store of fuel in the @entity20 area			2
the pipeline runs 130 miles from the @entity13 refinery in @entity12 near @entity56 to the @entity57 and is 14in in diameter ' early indications suggest that the fuel may have come from a nearby @entity13 pipeline			1
investigations continue into whether this is the case			0
' @entity13 is committed to the very highest standards of safety			0
the pipeline has therefore been closed down and our specialists are working to check it and , if necessary , effect any repair			0
' we will not resume operations of the pipeline until this work is complete			0
' detectives from @entity78 said they are investigating the ' sophisticated ' and ' potentially lethal ' plot to siphon the fuel			2
a force spokesman said : ' we can confirm two men , aged 32 and 34 from the @entity107 area , remain in police custody for questioning this evening			0
' both men were arrested in @entity107 last night on suspicion of conspiracy to steal fuel			0
' @entity78 launched an investigation after a large quantity of diesel was found in an industrial storage unit at @entity38			0
' lines of inquiry include establishing the exact amount of fuel stolen and examining the suspected sophisticated method used in this alleged theft			1
' the discovery was made by the unit 's owner at around 7.30pm on thursday			0
it is believed to have been illegally obtained			0
' the exact quantity and circumstances surrounding the accumulation of fuel are central to the investigation , and detectives are focusing on identifying those responsible			0
' the fuel is stored safely and securely and is being retrieved by engineers from the nearby @entity13 refinery			1
' the investigation , led by @entity134 , is still in its early stages and this is all the information we are able to release at this time			0

fuel taken from the pipeline running from @entity13 refinery in @entity14
today , @entity13 took the *decision* to close the major fuel supply route
amount stolen would be worth about £ 41,000 at pump prices
detectives investigating the theft have made two arrests
