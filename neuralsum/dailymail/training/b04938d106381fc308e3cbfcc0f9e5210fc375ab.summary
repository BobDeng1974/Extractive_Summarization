dangerous : something as simple as deodorant could put mothers - to - be at risk of a miscarriage a chemical found in dozens of household items may double a woman ’s risk of miscarriage , researchers warn			1
scientists said pregnant women should avoid canned food , stop heating food in plastic containers and even avoid touching cash register receipts			2
researchers from the prestigious @entity17 in @entity18 found pregnant women with the highest levels of the chemical bisphenol a ( @entity20 ) in their blood were 80 per cent more likely to miscarry			1
they measured levels of the chemical – found in plastics and items including water bottles , sunglasses and cd cases – when the pregnancy was confirmed by the doctor			1
lead researcher dr @entity31 said : ‘ until further studies are performed , women with unexplained miscarriages should avoid bpa exposure in an effort to remove one potential risk factor			2
‘ there are some simple things that people can do , but it ’s impossible to avoid it completely			0
‘ avoid anything that involves cooking or warming food in plastic as the chemicals leak out of plastic materials at a higher rate at higher temperatures			0
‘ avoid canned food , avoid cooking or heating plastic and also avoid touching things that have high @entity20 resin – something as simple as a cash register receipt which is coded with resin that has bpa in it			1
’ miscarriages are common and statistically one in three women in the @entity62 will suffer one at some point during their lives			1
a spokesman from the @entity67 said the @entity69 study was too small to draw any firm conclusions , and warned against causing further worry for pregnant women who are already told to avoid many products , including caffeine , alcohol , tobacco , raw eggs and pate			0
in another study , the @entity79 ’s @entity78 looked at the records of 501 couples who were trying to become pregnant between 2005 and 2009			0
all provided urine samples which were measured for levels of @entity20 and phthalates – another group of chemicals used in plastics			1
warning : researchers said miscarriage risks increased by 80 per cent when women came into contact with @entity20 they were monitored for a year and kept diaries stating if and when they became pregnant			1
oddly , the researchers found that high levels of phthalates affected men ’s fertility but not women ’s			2
couples where the male partner had high recordings were 20 per cent more likely not to conceive within the year			0
dr @entity103 , president of the @entity104 , said : ‘ these chemicals are a cause of concern to all of us			0
' we do n’t know necessarily the exact biochemical mechanism [ cause ] but other studies point to the need to be aware of the use of these chemicals			0
’ the findings from the two studies follow a @entity119 move to ban phthalates and bisphenol a amid suggestions they also cause breast cancer , leukaemia , asthma and birth defects			1
the @entity119 said the chemicals had ‘ serious implications ’ for health , and a ban was needed to ‘ protect future generations ’			2
@entity132 , of the campaign group @entity133 , said : ‘ both pieces of research highlight how vitally important it is for the @entity62 government to agree the need for @entity140 measures to eliminate our exposure to all hormone disruptors			2
' we could be jeopardising future generations as hormones are so fundamental to our ability to reproduce			0
’ the studies are being presented today at the @entity104 ’s conference in @entity149 .			0

@entity119 aims to ban *toxins* causing 80 *%* miscarriage risk
@entity20 ( @entity20 ) is found in plastic water bottles , receipts and glasses
phthalates are found in nail *varnish* , make - up , deodorant and *shampoo*
the @entity164 asks us to point out that the plastic material used to contain naturally *sourced* bottled waters found on @entity62 *supermarket* *shelves* is made of @entity169 ( @entity169 ) . ' there is no @entity20 ( @entity20 ) in @entity169 plastic . @entity169 is the main *packaging* used for *beverages* , it is completely safe and complies with all @entity176 and national legal *requirements* ' , said a *spokeswoman* .
