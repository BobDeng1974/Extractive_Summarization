the @entity0 is set to launch the first of two blimps designed to help the military detect and destroy cruise missiles or rogue aircraft incursions targeting @entity8 's @entity7 cities			1
the first radar - toting vehicle will be set airborne next week as part of a three - year test of the latest defense system at an @entity0 facility near @entity14 , @entity15			1
when fully deployed next february , the $ 2.8billion system will feature two , unmanned , helium - filled aerostats - able to scan the oceans and coastline in a 340 - mile radius			1
defense project : the @entity0 is set to launch the first of two blimps designed to help the military detect and destroy cruise missiles targeting the nation 's capital or other major @entity7 cities one balloon will continuously scan in a circle from @entity29 to @entity31 's @entity30 , and as far west as central @entity32			1
the other will carry precision radar to help the military on the ground to pinpoint targets			2
the system is called @entity39 - short for @entity40 elevated netted sensor system			2
the project , built by @entity43 of @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity15 , has cost the government about $ 2.8 billion so far			2
and last week @entity49 approved another $ 43.3 million for the first year of the test			0
reducing costs : despite the project setting the @entity8 government back by Â£ 2.8billion , experts say the airships will save money in the long run by reducing the need for surveillance by conventional aircraft despite the staggering cost , supporters of the project say @entity39 will save money in the long run by reducing the need for surveillance by conventional aircraft			1
' the analysis we 've done says it 's about five to seven times less than operating a fleet of aircraft to cover the same area over the same time period , ' said @entity72 , @entity43 's @entity39 program director			0
the white balloons , each 80 yards long , are part of a new wave of lighter - than - air surveillance equipment			0
testing : a giant radar dome is seen on the bottom of the unmanned aerostat , which will be launched next week they will not carry weapons as enemy missiles would be destroyed by air , ground or ship - based weapons			1
major general @entity86 , commander of the 263rd @entity87 and @entity40 , said : ' we can defeat cruise missiles but we have limited capability to detect			0
' and so , with an elevated sensor , such as @entity39 , and the ability to look out over the horizon , now we have the ability to detect and to enable our systems to defeat cruise missiles			0
' the government has also deployed tethered airships near the @entity99 border , in @entity100 and @entity101 and in the @entity102 to combat drug smuggling			0
the airships at @entity105 , @entity15 , will be the first of their type near a major @entity7 city , visible from @entity109			1
plan : when fully deployed next spring , the system will feature two , unmanned , helium - filled aerostats , tethered to concrete pads 4 miles apart the military has insisted that the balloons will not carry cameras in response to privacy campaigners ' concerns about snooping			1
but @entity121 , of the @entity122 in @entity15 , said the group was leery of the airships ' ability to constantly monitor moving objects , including cars on the ground			2
mr @entity86 says the radar is unable to identify individuals or record cellphone conversations			0
' the mission is not to spy on @entity8 citizens			0
it is not designed for that , ' he said .			0

@entity137 of two airships will be launched next week at @entity0 facility in @entity15
unmanned blimps will scan 340 miles of @entity7 using advanced radar
despite staggering cost , experts say system will save money in long term
privacy campaigners expressed concern over blimps ' snooping ability
