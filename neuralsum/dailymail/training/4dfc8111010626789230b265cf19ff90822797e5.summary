ordeal : @entity5 is pictured before he suffered the horrendous attack in february 2002 his mother @entity20 , 56 , who is now his full - time carer , said : ‘ @entity5 ’s condition is improving day - by - day and naturally he wants to know what has been happening over the last 11 years			1
‘ he still can not speak but the machine enables him to ask and provide some quite complex questions and answers			0
‘ lately he ’s been asking , “ have they caught the people who did this yet ? ” that ’s a fantastic thing for this family because it ’s a thought process entirely of his own			0
