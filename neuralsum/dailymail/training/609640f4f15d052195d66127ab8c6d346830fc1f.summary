prime minister @entity0 has abandoned a plan to cut the $ 20 @entity3 rebate for short consultations			1
health minister @entity5 announced the back - down on thursday after the government faced immense pressure from doctors and opposition @entity10			1
ms @entity5 said she was deeply concerned by misinformation causing confusion for patients and confusion for doctors about the changes			1
' the government is taking them off the table			2
' ' i have heard , i have listened and i have decided to take this action now , ' the minister said , after breaking her holiday to address the issue			2
however , she insisted it remained critical that there should be reform to ensure the @entity3 system has a sustainable future to give quality care			1
the minister made a strong commitment to undertake a wide ranging consultation on the ground with doctors and the community to come up with sensible options			2
' i need to explain ... that our @entity3 system is growing at a rapid and unsustainable rate			2
' the changes , introduced by the @entity0 government to cut costs , would have seen @entity3 pay $ 20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from january 19 earlier , @entity55 president @entity54 wrote to mr @entity0 urging him to intervene to overturn the plan to cut by $ 20.10 the rebate paid to gps for consultations under 10 minutes			1
doctors said the measure would lead to increased out - of - pocket expenses for patients and ultimately to higher national health costs			2
@entity65 , the @entity66 and four crossbenchers also vowed to team up to refuse the regulation after the @entity69 returns on february 9			0
' it was never a good idea , and mr @entity0 should take this opportunity to ditch it and instead consult with the medical profession on how to support quality primary healthcare , ' associate professor @entity54 said on thursday			0
doctors said the measure would lead to increased out - of - pocket expenses for patients and ultimately to higher national health costs earlier in the day , small business minister @entity77 said the government would push on with the important reform to discourage doctors from practising so - called six - minute medicine			1
' we 'll continue to make the case that this reform is necessary			0
it is thoughtful , it is prudent			0
this change is on the table			0
it is being implemented , ' mr @entity77 told reporters in @entity28 on thursday			0
' it is an important measure and there are no alternatives being advocated by anybody			0
' his comments followed a statement on wednesday from ms @entity5 , who accused @entity65 of playing politics with the issue			2
' without reform , @entity3 will collapse under its own weight and jeopardise the world - class , affordable healthcare @entity105 take for granted , ' her statement said			1
@entity65 , the @entity66 and four crossbenchers also vowed to team up to refuse the regulation after the @entity69 returns on february 9 @entity3 has paid $ 37.05 towards short visits for years , and the plan was to cut that amount to $ 16.95			1
critics said the change would prompt doctors to stop bulk billing these shorter consultations and start charging patients to cover costs			0
the @entity0 government also scrapped its plan for a $ 7 @entity3 co-payment before @entity121			1
instead , an optional co-payment would be introduced at the same time the @entity3 rebate to @entity58 is reduced by $ 5			1
it will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them			0
incentives to bulk bill children under 16 , concession card holders , pensioners and veterans will remain in place			0
