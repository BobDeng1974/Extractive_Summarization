with the rise of online dating , there has never before been as many ways of meeting potential partners as there is today			2
but one single man has taken up a rather different , and apparently successful , approach in his bid to find his soulmate - plastering posters advertising his search for girlfriend a across @entity13			1
artist @entity14 , 50 , is pasting 500 flyers a day round @entity16 emblazoned with the message ' looking for a girlfriend ' , along with his picture and mobile number			1
he said : ' i 'm not desperate - i just want to find a more meaningful relationship			1
i have already got a couple of dates lined up thanks to the posters			2
' the artist from @entity39 turned his back on more modern match - making methods such as dating apps and sites after being single for two years following the break up of his marriage			1
but in a spur of the moment move , he decided to print 500 flyers bearing the message : ' i 'm really looking for a girlfriend			1
this is not a joke			2
just tired of the singles scene and hoping to meet the right person			0
i am a professional artist and creative person			1
you know who you are			0
to me each and every person is beautiful			0
open to the possibility of the relationship morphing into something more profound			0
' in the first few hours after posting the initial batch , mr @entity14 received more than 100 calls - and despite a number of those being prank calls , he decided to carry on the campaign for one whole month			1
he is now even being recognised in the street as pictures of his posters are shared across social networking sites			0
the posters , which mr @entity14 sticks to walls , lampposts and telephone boxes , have seen him inundated with more than 1,600 calls in over a week - and he has now even got a couple of dates lined up mr @entity14 said : ' it has been interesting to see the reactions of people			1
you 'd be surprised at the amount of female attention it has drawn			0
' of course there have been some odd phone calls			2
but there has been an overwhelming amount of women getting in touch too			0
' my family and friends think i 'm crazy , but they see it works			0
some days i wake up to hundreds of texts			0
' some women however have not been too impressed by the campaign , with one female @entity13 telling local tv she thought it was ' kind of weird , and a little scary			0
' the artist from @entity39 turned his back on more modern match - making methods such as dating apps and sites after being single for two years following the break up of his marriage mr @entity14 remains confident his relentless flyer campaign will find him true love			1
he said : ' it definitely works , it is just my choosing and pickiness that is holding it up			0
' i 'm abstaining from sex right now because i 'm looking for the right girl , not just a sexual encounter - i 've had plenty of opportunities for sex over all those phone calls			1
' i thought at first that it would take a week , but i 'm hopeful that within a month i 'll have found the right girl			2
