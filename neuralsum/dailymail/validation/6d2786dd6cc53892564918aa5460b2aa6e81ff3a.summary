all - rounder @entity0 took a hat - trick as @entity2 put one foot in the @entity4 semi-finals by dismissing @entity5 for 133 in their last eight clash at the @entity8 on wednesday			1
bidding to win their first ever knockout match at a @entity4 , the @entity10 bowlers removed both openers inside the first five overs and never eased up the pressure thereafter			0
@entity0 ( 3 - 29 ) dismissed @entity5 skipper @entity15 ( 19 ) with the final ball of the 33rd over and returned to send back @entity17 ( 1 ) and @entity19 debutant @entity18 ( 0 ) with the first two deliveries of the 35th			1
the ninth @entity4 hat - trick left the 1996 champions reeling at 116 - 8 after the loss four wickets for just two runs in three overs and when @entity28 was dismissed soon afterwards , the writing was on the wall			1
@entity28 , who had been looking for a fifth successive century , scored a measured 45 from 95 balls but was forced to throw off the shackles as the wickets tumbled around him and holed out to deep third man off paceman @entity35			0
a heavy shower appeared out of the blue as if to mourn what looks like being the final one - day innings of one of the game 's great batsmen and the players came off the pitch for a 23 - minute rain break			0
it only delayed the inevitable , however , and @entity47 ( 3 ) was the last man to depart , hammering the ball to @entity49 at cover off @entity2 's other main spin threat @entity52			2
@entity52 took 4 - 26 , including the wicket of @entity54 to leave another retiring @entity5 batting great with a tally of four runs in his final innings in the 50 - over format			2
@entity5 , who won the toss and chose to bat , were never able to score at a pace that would have put pressure on the @entity65 and test their mental resolve			0
while @entity28 was at the crease , though , they would have fancied their chances of putting on some kind of tally for their bowlers to defend			0
once he departed and the rain cleared , however , the semi-final appointment in @entity76 against @entity77 or @entity78 next week would now seem to be @entity2 's to keep			1
the @entity81 team practice at the @entity8 ahead of their quarter - final against @entity2 @entity65 captain @entity84 ( right ) will be hoping to lead his team to the last four			2

@entity5 bowled out for 133 against @entity2 in @entity8
@entity0 took a hat - trick on way to figures of 3 - 29
winner of clash at @entity8 will play @entity77 or @entity78 in semi-final in @entity76 on *tuesday*
