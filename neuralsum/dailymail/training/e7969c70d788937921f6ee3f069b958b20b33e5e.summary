it may sound like a scene out of the 1980s hit comedy film @entity2 , but an @entity5 fisherman had a real - life fight with this five - foot - long reptile			1
@entity9 became so enraged when he discovered yet another crocodile on the end of his fishing line that he tackled the animal before taking it home and spending the night with it sleeping below his bunk bed			1
mr @entity9 had been spending his 45th birthday fishing for @entity20 seabass , barramundi , at @entity22 , in the river mouth at @entity24 , approximately 55 miles south of @entity25 , when he thought he 'd caught a fish			1
bunking down for the night : @entity9 with the five - foot - long crocodile that became tangled in his fishing lines at @entity22 , @entity24 , @entity5 but when he went to reel his catch in , he discovered a five - foot - long crocodile at the end of his line			1

' i thought i 'd caught my one - metre barra			1
i was so happy , i was yahooing and carrying on			0
' twenty minutes later after fighting it i brought it to the surface and when the moon came out from behind the clouds i realised it was a croc tangled up in my fishing line			2
' real - life @entity2 : @entity9 , pictured with @entity47 councillor @entity46 , watched the reptile overnight until animal rescue services could attend to it in the morning mr @entity9 said he did n't want the crocodile to die in the netting but was also still fed up with the reptiles stealing his bait and stalking him at local fishing haunts			1
so mr @entity9 placed the crocodile in his car to drive to his local councillor 's to complain about the overpopulation of reptiles in the area			2
unfortunately @entity47 councillor , @entity46 , who also holds the council 's crocodile management portfolio , was asleep so mr @entity9 was left with no choice but to bunk down with the animal for the night until it could be taken to a wildlife park			2
