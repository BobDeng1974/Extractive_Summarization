by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 23 july 2013 updated : 09:14 est , 23 july 2013 one third of 18 to 24 - year - old @entity2 take painkillers on a daily basis , according to a new survey			1
the study revealed that 33 per cent of young @entity2 take pain medication every day while 32 per cent would take a painkiller within 20 minutes of experiencing pain			1
the survey , by @entity11 , also found that the most common reason for taking a painkiller is a tension headache			1
this could be explained by the fact that 41 per cent of the young people interviewed believe that their generation is under more stress than any other			2
one third of 18 to 24 - year - old @entity2 take painkillers on a daily basis , according to a new survey the survey also revealed confusion about how painkillers reduce pain			1
when asked how they understood painkillers to work , 40 per cent of under 25s believed they only ‘ mask ’ the pain rather than tackle it directly			2
the findings are concerning doctors as taking more than the maximum daily recommended dose of paracetamol can damage a person 's liver			2
this is especially problematic in young people as the impact of painkillers on the liver is increased by drinking alcohol			1
it is also believed that taking ibuprofen regularly may cause stomach ulcers			1
experts have warned that many young people could actually be giving themselves headaches by taking too many painkillers - a condition known as rebound headaches - which can trigger painkiller abuse			1
the risk of this is highest for those taking aspirin , ibuprofen or paracetamol at least every other day to treat headaches or another sources of pain			2
there are also fears that young people may not realise that products such as cold and flu remedies contain paracetamol , so they end up having a double dose			2
# @entity70 released late last year found that more than 62 million prescriptions are written annually on the @entity72 , a 30 per cent rise in only five years			0
figures show another six billion pills were bought over the counter last year , with sales growing at 4.1 per cent annually			0
but there are concerns that tens of thousands of adults – mainly women – are addicted to the drugs , having initially taken them to ease a minor ailment			0
the study revealed that 32 per cent of young @entity2 take a painkiller within 20 minutes of experiencing pain and the most common cause is a headache and this week , a leading expert spoke out about the dangers of taking co-codamol , an opioid painkiller , which can be highly addictive			1
the drug , which contains paracetamol and codeine , creates a feeling of calm and well - being which can be addictive , especially for women			0
the problem is so severe that @entity102 dr @entity101 , from @entity103 , is calling for urgent research into the scale of the issue			0
however , co-codamol is not the only painkiller that comes with a health warning			0
doctors have been told to stop prescribing diclofenac to people with heart conditions or circulation problems			0
it is believed that the drug can increase a patient 's risk of having a heart attack or a stroke			0
as a result , the @entity121 said that it should not be given to people with serious underlying heart conditions .			0

32 *%* of young @entity2 take painkillers within 20 minutes of experiencing pain
the most common cause of pain is a tension headache
but experts are warning of the danger , with paracetamol linked to liver problems and ibuprofen to stomach ulcers
