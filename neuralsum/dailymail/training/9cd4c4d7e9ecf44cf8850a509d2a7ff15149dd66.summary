@entity0 is reluctant to sign a new contract at @entity2 and wants crunch talks with @entity4 after the @entity5			1
the @entity6 international has two years left on his current @entity9 deal , but the @entity11 club are keen to safeguard his value by offering him a new deal this summer			1
however , @entity0 wants assurances over his first - team opportunities at @entity2 before considering extending his deal			2
@entity0 knows his future will pose @entity2 a problem in the coming months , and is unwilling to relinquish his growing position of strength by penning fresh terms			2
with just two years left to run on his current deal , @entity0 knows @entity2 will have to cash in on him in the next two transfer windows before the prospect of losing the striker on a free transfer in 2016 becomes a real possibility			0
it 's good to talk : @entity4 and @entity0 are planning on talking after the @entity5 season to remember : @entity0 had an excellent season for @entity25 last season scoring 16 goals signing a new contract would eliminate any immediate rush for @entity2 to make a decision on @entity0 ’s future			1
and the 21 - year - old wants to meet with @entity4 to find out if signing a new deal would see him fully re-integrated in to the first - team set - up at @entity2 or simply be made available for loan again			0
as @entity51 revealed earlier this week @entity0 is a target for @entity53 as they look to replace @entity2 - bound @entity54			0
part of the deal ? @entity53 are keen on @entity0 as part of the deal that could take @entity54 to @entity2 the prospect of including @entity0 in the deal for @entity54 has been explored , but third - party ownership issues in relation to the @entity62 international would provide a major obstacle in a deal structured that way			0
if @entity2 do decide to sell @entity0 this summer then they will want to recoup at least the £ 17million they paid for him three years ago			0
in addition to @entity53 , there is interest from @entity71 while @entity25 manager @entity72 is keen on signing @entity0 on a permanent basis following his successful loan spell .			1
