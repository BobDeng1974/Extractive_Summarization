@entity0 was lucky not to be seriously injured in @entity2 's latest pre season outing , just managing to get out of the way of a terrible two - footed tackle from @entity6 defender @entity5			1
it might have been a friendly but the uncompromising @entity9 centre back seemed to be taking it seriously - diving in for a dangerous challenge on @entity2 's Â£ 32million forward			2
combative @entity0 was right in the 32 - year - old 's face immediately after to let him know what he thought of the foul , but the guilty party was let off by the referee with just a yellow card			0
with the @entity6 centre back left as the last man on a @entity2 counter attack , @entity0 pushed the ball slightly too far forward and @entity5 saw his opportunity to take it before sending his man tumbling in a tackle that could have broken his leg if it was a split second earlier			1
with just @entity44 and @entity45 as backup , @entity2 are pinning their title hopes on the @entity49 striker - and will be relieved to see him escape from @entity19 unharmed			0
not so friendly : @entity2 , led by captain @entity50 , confront the referee after the challenge			0

@entity2 's summer signing could have been hurt by @entity5 ' terrible tackle
the centre forward was bearing down on goal when he was taken out
@entity5 used two feet , taking the ball and the man in the *process*
@entity0 earlier scored a brilliant goal to put @entity2 ahead in @entity19 friendly
