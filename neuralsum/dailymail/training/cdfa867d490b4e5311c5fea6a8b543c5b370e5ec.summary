@entity6 , 31 , is trying to find a stem cell donor for @entity8 , 29 , who has leukaemia ms @entity16 , who lives @entity17 , said : ‘ our friends and family in @entity21 and @entity17 have rallied around , asking what they can do to help , and at least 20 of them joined the @entity24 donor register straight away			1
‘ any one of them could be a match for someone like @entity8 who needs a donor			2
‘ it 's so easy and straightforward to sign up			0
we started thinking that if we channel our energies into getting our friends , and friends of friends , and even strangers , to join the register , we could make a big difference			2
’ in march this year , mr @entity8 , who also lives in @entity17 , started to suffer from fatigue and night sweats			1
he visited a doctor who carried out blood tests and just four hours later he was given the devastating news that he has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia			2
at the time ms @entity6 , a physiotherapist , was halfway through a six month backpacking trip in @entity44			1
mr @entity8 was diagnosed with leukaemia in march and will need a stem cell transplant in early july mr @entity8 was diagnosed just three months after proposing to ms @entity6			1
he went to a doctor after developing fatigue and night sweats and blood tests confirmed he had leukaemia the couple had become engaged just three weeks before she left , while enjoying their last weekend away together before her trip			2
mr @entity8 called ms @entity6 on her mobile while she was in a remote internet café in @entity44			1
she assumed he was ringing with good news because he had been waiting to hear the results of a job interview he had attended			0
visit @entity61 to join the donor register			1
on the website you can request a ' spit kit '			0
this will be sent to you in the post and you can provide a saliva sample by spitting into the pot and posting it back to the charity			2
when @entity24 receives the sample , you will be added to the register			2
ms @entity6 is also running the # shake4mike campaign			1
she is urging people to post pictures of themselves shaking their faces on @entity78 and @entity79 while pledging to join the register			1
she would also like them to nominate others to do the same			0
she told @entity82 that she knew he had been having blood tests but that she just assumed they would come back normal			0
instead , 5,000 miles from home , she was told he had cancer			0
ms @entity6 said : ‘ i had been due to go on a three week trek in @entity90 the following day , so if the news had come a day later , @entity8 would n't have been able to reach me for weeks			1
‘ thankfully , i got the message in time and after a gruelling 10 hour bus journey , 12 hour wait in @entity95 , two 11 hour flights and a three hour car journey i was finally by his side			0
’ she added : ‘ i was completely shocked when he told me			0
my only plan was to get home			0
‘ it was the worst day of my life			0
i tried to calm myself down and focus on getting home but the journey was awful			0
‘ i felt better a soon as i got to him			0
’ ms @entity6 went on to explain that this is not the first time her family has been struck by tragedy			1
in 2005 her father , who was 59 , developed a blood clot in his leg and died suddenly in front of her mother and sister			0
a few weeks later her grandmother died , and just eight days after her death , ms @entity6 says her grandfather died of a broken heart			1
following the spate of expected deaths , ms @entity6 ’s mother ’s best friend , 38 - year - old @entity123 , moved in to support the family			1
mr @entity8 ( pictured before his illness ) is currently having chemotherapy and will need the transplant when the chemotherapy regime finishes			1
devastatingly , none of his three brothers are matches for him shockingly , within two months he had suffered a brain haemorrhage and he also passed away			0
ms @entity6 and mr @entity8 met in 2009 and ms @entity6 says he turned her life around and made her smile again			1
she says he helped her to move on from the tragedies of 2005			0
as a result , she says she is now determined to be his ‘ rock ’ and says she will not give up without a fight			0
after his diagnosis , mr @entity8 started chemotherapy at @entity141			1
he will finish his current chemotherapy regime in early july at which point he will need a stem cell transplant			1
ms @entity6 worked with @entity24 to launch the # shake4mike campaign			1
she 's urging people to take pictures of themselves shaking their faces and to post them on @entity78 while pledging to join the register all of his three brothers have been tested but , devastatingly , none are a match for mr @entity8			1
ms @entity6 told @entity82 that there was about a 60 per cent chance that one of his brothers would be a match so it was a ‘ devastating blow ’ when they learned that none were matches			1
as a result , he and his family have turned to the blood cancer charity @entity24 for help finding a lifesaving donor from the register			2
ms @entity6 said : ‘ @entity8 now has so much ahead of him - a new job , a wedding and building a family - but he desperately needs to find a matching stem cell donor so that he can focus on getting better and embrace his future			1
’ as a result , she is urging people to join the register by visiting www.anthonynolan.org and requesting a ‘ spit kit ’			1
potential donors , who must be between the ages of 16 and 30 , can just spit into the kit and send it back to the charity and they will be added to the register			2
ms @entity6 says she will be mr @entity8 's rock and that she will not give up without a fight most people who join the register are never asked to donate			1
however , for those who are , there are two different procedures they could be asked to undergo			0
about 90 per cent will be able to donate their stem cells quickly and easily in a process similar to blood donation			2
@entity189 is cancer of the white blood cells			0
acute leukaemia is that which progresses rapidly and aggressively			2
lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes - the white blood cells that fight viral infections			2
symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin , tiredness , breathlessness and repeated infections			0
it affects about 650 people a year in the @entity206 and is the most common type of cancer in children			2
approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it			0
about 85 per cent of cases occur in children under the age of 15			0
treatment usually involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a stem cell transplant is sometimes required			1
source : @entity222 this takes about four to five hours and sometimes needs to be repeated the following day			0
however , it does not require a general anaesthetic and the donor will not be required to stay in hospital			0
the other 10 per cent will be asked to donate by giving stem cells from the bone marrow in their pelvises			0
this requires bone marrow to be taken from the pelvis and is usually carried out under general anaesthetic to prevent the donor experiencing too much pain			0
most donors who give in this way are required to stay in hospital for 12 to 24 hours to recover from the anaesthetic			0
ms @entity6 is also asking that people get involved in the # shake4mike campaign			1
she wants people to take a photo of themselves while shaking their heads and to share the picture on @entity78 or @entity79 while pledging to join the donor register			1
she hopes people will then also nominate a friend to do the same			0
she told @entity82 : ‘ the idea was to get people to shake their faces at cancer – at leukaemia			2
‘ we wanted to have a funny and light hearted campaign that people could really get behind			0
