@entity0 is poised to make his first @entity2 appearance for a year and a first @entity4 start since march 2013 , after @entity5 suffered a setback in his recovery from concussion			1
having been knocked out in an accidental collision with @entity12 centre @entity10 at @entity13 10 days ago , @entity5 was expected to come through the return to play protocols in time to retain his no 15 shirt against @entity17 in @entity18 on sunday			1
however , the @entity20 full - back experienced concussion symptoms again last friday , after cycling , so he was forced to begin the whole process from scratch on monday			1
@entity26 full back @entity0 is tackled by @entity29 centre @entity27 on saturday @entity0 fields a high ball during an @entity2 training session at @entity32 last tuesday @entity5 showcases his aerial skills during @entity2 's victory against the @entity12 at @entity13 while @entity36 has not yet ruled @entity5 out of contention for the crucial encounter between the two remaining unbeaten teams in the @entity40 , all the indications on monday night were that he would not be available			1
' @entity5 was symptom - free , then he did the bike on friday and there were some symptoms after that , so he had to step down again , ' said @entity2 's head coach			1
' he 's had a rest over the weekend and started the return - to - play process again today			2
' i 've got to be 100 per cent certain that he 's right with the type of knock it was and also to go into the size of game that this is			0
the reality is he wo n't have trained from the ( @entity12 ) game to potentially this friday , which is 13 days			2
you have to have the team ready to play			0
@entity5 lays motionless on the pitch after the @entity20 full back collided with @entity12 centre @entity10 @entity5 received medical attention on the pitch following his heavy collision with @entity10 @entity5 left the field on a stretcher and did not return to the field following his concussion ' a lot will depend on how the next 24 hours go but a decision will have to be made within the next two days because the team need a chance to prepare with all the pieces in place			1
it will be a judgement call based on a medical call			0
' @entity5 seems increasingly likely to miss out and his loss would be keenly felt			0
he has been an outstanding main - stay of @entity2 's recent victories over @entity78 and @entity12			2
@entity0 last played for @entity2 on march 9 last year – against @entity78 at @entity13 – but he has been in fine form for @entity26 and @entity80 values his attributes as a playmaker full - back			1
the 26 - year - old has n't started for his country since the record 30 - 3 defeat in @entity86 almost two years ago , but his misfortune has been to find himself challenging a man who was untouchable last year , as @entity5 was named @entity89 among a host of personal awards			2
' he 's been unlucky in the sense that the stand - out player in the @entity40 last year was @entity5 , in his position			0
he 's had to wait patiently for his chance again			0
he 's certainly confident and he feels he 's ready , should his opportunity come , i think he 'd be ready to take his chance			0
@entity100 full back @entity98 has also been called into the squad after making his test debut last june ' he 's a different type of player to @entity5 in that he 's equally good under the high ball , he 's very good as a positional full - back and he can play fly - half , so he offers that slightly different kicking option , but also the opportunity to be a first receiver - playmaker			1
' @entity100 full back @entity98 has also been called into the squad after making his test debut last june in @entity112 and more recently playing superbly for the @entity113 in @entity114			1
however , @entity0 is surely destined to take @entity5 's place in @entity18			2
@entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 are all expected to be available for training on tuesday after recovering from injuries , and the three forwards are all theoretically in contention for a return to the match - day 23 at the @entity125			0
@entity36 is due to name his team on friday			0
@entity116 ( left ) and @entity117 are expected to be available for training on tuesday			0
