@entity2 ’s last chance of a @entity4 winner before he retires has evaporated after @entity5 , his intended mount in this afternoon ’s @entity4 at @entity6 was withdrawn			1
@entity2 will bring an end to his two - decade domination of jump racing after he rides at @entity10 a week today			1
but he will be a spectator in the big race this afternoon after unsuitable drying conditions at @entity14 track prompted @entity5 to be scratched			1
@entity2 finished fifth on @entity15 in the @entity16 , but will not ride in the @entity4 @entity2 ’s final quest for national glory began in the @entity20 version of the race when sixth on @entity22 on @entity23			1
the soon - to - be - crowned 20 - time champion was then fifth on favourite @entity25 in last saturday ’s @entity16			2
@entity2 , who recorded the 4,348th win when successful on @entity27 at @entity6 , said : ‘ it is disappointing not to be riding in the @entity4 but the ground was going to be too quick for @entity5 and , sadly , i could n't do the weight on any of the others			1
’ @entity2 has three rides at @entity6 today - @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 – but then is not expected to ride again until the @entity10 next weekend			1
a crowd of close to 20,000 is expected at @entity10 with only a few tickets still unsold			2
a heavily - influenced @entity2 day will see the venue festooned in banners bearing his name while his 2010 @entity16 winner do n’t push it and @entity42 , an eight - time winner when ridden by him , will be among the champion racehorses to be paraded			2
@entity2 will be presented with the trophy for his 20 championship before the third race , the @entity46 in which he is expected to ride @entity51 - trained mr @entity50			1
meanwhile , @entity52 says he is confident @entity54 winner @entity53 will at least stay the seven furlongs of this afternoon ’s @entity55 at @entity56			2
@entity2 will retire next week , but had been hoping for a final national success before @entity5 withdrew but evidence will have to be conclusive if the speedy filly , who won six of her eight races as a two - year - old , is to cement her position for the one mile @entity65 at @entity66 on may 3			1
if her stamina is found out , a sprinting career would beckon			2
@entity52 said : ‘ she has been settling very well at home and she has been here and won before			0
hopefully , she will feel at home			0
‘ i do n’t think seven furlongs will be a problem and if she gets that there is a chance she will get further			0
this race will take the freshness out of her			0
’ @entity52 puts 2.000 @entity65 hopes @entity82 and @entity81 , the @entity84 runner - up , on classic trial in @entity56 ’s one mile @entity80 and @entity81 also has stamina questions to answer			0
@entity52 said : ‘ @entity87 is by ( sire ) @entity88 , who never got further than five furlongs and he has loads of speed			0
@entity82 will definitely get a mile and i hope they both will			0
it will be a finding out day			0
’ the @entity80 also features @entity96 - trained @entity95 , the 2014 @entity98 winner .			0
