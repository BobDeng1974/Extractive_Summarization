by @entity0 and @entity1 for the @entity2 the @entity3 were accused of losing their ‘ moral compass ’ last night after @entity5 was allowed back into the party despite claims he groped a string of women activists			1
alleged victims reacted with fury , saying the party ’s reputation had been ‘ torn to shreds ’ and women would desert it in droves			2
it also emerged last night that @entity5 will keep his position on an influential party policy committee – and will be free to stand for high office within the party and campaign at next year ’s general election			1
@entity5 , pictured , is free to rejoin the @entity3 group in the @entity24 after the decision @entity26 today hit out at the decision to clear @entity5 of bringing the party into disrepute business secretary @entity29 said the @entity3 could still consult @entity5 and ‘ use his expertise ’ in the forthcoming campaign			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ i ’m sure people will want to use his expertise			0
but my understanding is that wo n’t be in a major full - time role			0
’ there was outrage at the party ’s handling of the announcement , with alleged victims told only moments before the news broke on @entity46 , late on tuesday night			1
in a statement , the peer said he was ‘ pleased ’ with the outcome , stressing that none of the claims against him had been proved			2
he even warned media outlets against repeating the accounts of the women who claim he groped them , which he said were ‘ defamatory ’			0
deputy prime minister @entity57 said the party had ‘ taken a long hard look in the mirror ’ over the allegations and insisted changes had been made			2
party officials said @entity5 would have no role in the manifesto process nor in the party election campaign			1
but there will be nothing to stop him campaigning as a @entity3 supporter and he remains an elected member of the policy committee			1
@entity5 was feted by senior party figures because of his skill in masterminding many of the party ’s past triumphs at the polling booths , and can now retake his place among the @entity3 group in the @entity24			1
he was suspended last year during a disciplinary process after four activists – @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity26 – publicly accused him of touching them inappropriately			1
in may last year he issued an apology for encroaching on their ‘ personal space ’ – prompting several of his alleged victims to call for him to be permanently expelled			0
after police dropped their probe into the allegations , a @entity92 , @entity93 , was asked to produce an independent report			0
he concluded that although the evidence against the peer was ‘ broadly credible ’ , the allegations could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt			2
then last night the peer was formally reinstated by a party committee which concluded he had not brought the party into disrepute by refusing to apologise for what happened			1
miss @entity84 , a former aide to mr @entity57 , said she was ‘ very disappointed ’ by the decision			2
miss @entity26 , 42 , quit the @entity3 in fury over the handling of her case			1
‘ people , especially women , are telling me they will never vote @entity3 again , ’ she said			1
‘ you are risking a lot when you are a woman when you come forward with a story like this and nothing has happened			0
‘ we ’ve been told we ’re “ credible ” in our claims but then ignored			0
it ’s not like when the party went against its policy on student fees – we ’re talking about half the population with women voters			0
all they have done is pay lip service to those who came forward with claims			0
mrs @entity26 , a former ward councillor in @entity129 , added : ‘ there has been no change in the party , just an awful lot of words and no action			1
i think he has got away with it – he ’s been extremely lucky			0
i just hope he reflects on it and does n’t do it to anyone else			0
the mother of three said : ‘ the party has shown no leadership on this matter			0
they just do n’t have a moral compass when it comes to things like this			0
‘ i found out about five minutes before it broke on @entity46			0
’ another former @entity3 female worker , who made complaints about @entity5 but does not wish to be named , said young women would be reluctant to vote for mr @entity57			1
she said : ‘ the parochialism of the party has engineered a no - verdict rule on @entity5 , allowing him to get off scot - free			1
‘ a dubious character had gotten off on a technicality , but his reputation and that of the party has been torn to shreds			0
‘ @entity162 will be looking at this and think : “ i ca n’t vote for @entity57 and the @entity3 if this is how they treat women ”			2
’ mr @entity57 acknowledged that many women felt ‘ let down ’ but insisted the party had changed to ensure complaints would be handled better in the future			0
he said : ‘ the @entity3 have taken a long , hard look in the mirror since these allegations were made last year and i am confident that the party has changed			1
‘ it is clear that a number of women in our party felt let down that the party failed to act on their complaints appropriately			2
i am determined that no member of our party should find themselves in that position again			0
’ @entity5 said : ‘ i am pleased that all disciplinary investigations against me have been brought to an end and that the suspension of my party membership has been lifted			1
’ friends of @entity5 , pictured , said he had been subjected to a ' witch hunt ' over the past several months			2
