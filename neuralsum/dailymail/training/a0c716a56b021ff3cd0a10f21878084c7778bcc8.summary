the @entity0 is rapidly becoming a celebration of @entity2 and @entity3			1
@entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 are all exceeding expectations and exciting the world with their style of play			1
@entity12 are comfortably placed and after thursday even @entity13 have a performance of which they can be proud			0
but one nation from the region stands apart , unimpressive and uninspiring — and that is the most important one of all : @entity18			1
the hosts , synonymous with the idea that football should be joyful , stand apart from the carnival at present after two quite drab displays			2
@entity27 regard @entity0 wins as a birth - right and hosting the tournament has intensified that expectation , especially amid social unrest and protest , when many look to the team to be a unifying force for the nation			1
there is a very real fear among the authorities that an early exit will cause the daily protests against the cost and corruption of this tournament to escalate into a mass movement			0
so this side carries an even heavier load than most @entity18 teams			1
and it is clear much of the burden is falling upon 22 - year - old @entity24			0
going down : @entity75 wins a controversial penalty against @entity41 after slight contact from @entity78 spot on : @entity24 scores a penalty against @entity41 to put @entity18 2 - 1 ahead on june 12 no chance : @entity41 keeper @entity81 is helpless to stop @entity24 scoring from the penalty spot @entity84 , a member of the great 1970 @entity18 side and now a respected newspaper commentator , wrote : ‘ the major problem is the team ’s reliance on @entity24			1
if he plays well , then they are ok ; if not , it ’s a disaster			0
after the first match , i though @entity18 would be better against @entity7 but it was as though they were letting the game pass them by , waiting for good luck			1
’ @entity95 , the goalkeeper from the 1974 and 1978 @entity0 teams who captained his country and is now a renowned manager , has been a prominent critic			1
‘ the national team have been shocking , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity102 they started too slowly , as they had done against @entity41 , and they did n’t get the luck			2
nobody did anything special : the defenders were lost ; @entity107 and @entity108 were lost in midfield ; and @entity24 was lost			0
i do n’t know what was happening			0
inspired : @entity7 keeper @entity46 saves from @entity112 to deny @entity18 victory last week at full stretch : @entity46 dives to make a save during @entity7 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity18 in @entity117 ‘ against @entity34 on monday all the players need to be pressing more and better focused			1
@entity24 is a very good player but he is not alone on the pitch			0
all the players have to support him			2
in my opinion , at this moment the national team is not a united group			0
’ a feature of their games has been the stirring renditions of the national anthem , which has reduced some players , including @entity24 , to tears			2
@entity130 , a @entity27 great from the 1982 side who also played in the 1978 and 1986 @entity133 , said : ‘ all the players have to take care during the national anthem , because they need to have focus on the match			1
in the first game , i understood because the @entity0 was here and the game meant a lot to @entity27 people			2
breaking down : @entity24 was reduced to tears during @entity18 's national anthem before the @entity7 game work to do : @entity146 and his @entity18 players have yet to live up to expectations ' but they need to control themselves			1
i do n’t understand why the players were crying against @entity7			1
those kind of feelings can mean that you lose focus on the other team			0
if they want to become champions , they will need to concentrate on football			0
’ the question is what can @entity146 , the former @entity163 manager and 2002 @entity0 winner , do about the sluggish start ? the attacking options of @entity75 , @entity168 and @entity169 , who had inglorious spells at @entity172 and @entity173 , are hardly inspiring			1
@entity163 ’s @entity174 is yet to start , which is surprising			0
@entity146 is an old hand , having overseen the 2002 @entity27 triumph and taken @entity178 to the @entity180 final and 2006 @entity0 semi-final			1
but criticism will be intense if the display against @entity34 is again mediocre			0
stunned : @entity18 fans react after @entity185 's own goal gave @entity41 a 1 - 0 lead on june 12 @entity130 said : ‘ i do n’t know why @entity146 starts with @entity108 on the right			1
@entity7 played like champions and had perfect tactics to stop midfielders			2
and @entity18 did not react , maybe because they only played smaller teams during the preparations			2
’ @entity84 said : ‘ @entity7 , @entity146 had better options like @entity174 , @entity195 or @entity37 , to try to get closer to @entity24 , but he chose @entity196			1
it ’s clear the national team depends a lot on the talent of @entity24 , talent to create any offensive play			0
‘ in the last game , @entity203 , @entity107 , @entity75 , @entity108 and @entity196 did not have a good time			0
@entity30 was slow and @entity112 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity185 and @entity24 , played well , but some way from their best			0
they need to show more beauty in their play , to play like champions			0
’ @entity18 are a long way from that			2
the next few weeks could be very difficult if they can not fulfil expectations .			0

@entity18 's performances against @entity41 and @entity7 have been uninspiring
@entity95 has *labelled* @entity0 hosts ' shocking '
@entity130 has questioned why players were crying during national anthems
