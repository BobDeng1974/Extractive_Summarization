an author has claimed that ' people are ready ' for his forthcoming play which stars impressionist @entity3 as the disgraced paedophile @entity4			1
journalist @entity7 said while there had been some shock at the drama , @entity11 with @entity4 , the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it			1
it will open in @entity15 in june , less than three years since the late comedian 's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary			2
although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing , @entity7 claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts			0
in an interview with @entity41 he said : ' it has changed everything ; it has changed the way we look at abuse , it has changed the way we prosecute it , it has changed attitudes towards it , the way we treat the survivors of it			0
' what person would not want to explore what kicked it off ? ' drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of @entity4 's many victims , the play 's central role has been given to impressionist @entity3			1
most often recognised for his comedic performances , @entity7 said his leading actor is also ' terrific ' at embodying the ' dark , nasty ' elements of the story			2
in his popular @entity71 series , @entity69 , @entity3 included @entity4 in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed @entity74 rapper @entity73			1
@entity3 previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series @entity69			1
in a sketch he responds to a teenage @entity73 's repeated requests to appear on @entity79 'll fix it @entity82 users rejected @entity84 's claim the public was ' ready ' for the play , describing the subject choice as ' unbelievable ' dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by @entity90 , @entity3 writes to the @entity79 'll fix it host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent			1
later he impersonates @entity4 himself , responding : ' it would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the tv , especially at tea time			0
' sinisterly , he then tells the fictional teenage @entity73 that the pair could go to @entity100 ' in a few hours ' before giggling and licking his lips			0
author @entity7 said people were ' ready ' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the @entity109 's inquiry into abuse at the @entity71			1
while @entity7 said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking , he is confident the public , and @entity4 's victims , will be prepared for the drama			1
' yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time , but i think people are ready			0
' critics have however slammed his ' unbelievable ' subject choice			1
one @entity82 user said it was ' not quite right ' to portray the scandal , while another commented : ' why not make @entity129 the musical ? ' , referring to the @entity131 predator @entity132 who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse			0
@entity135 refuted @entity7 's claim that the public were ready , responding : ' it 's official , i am not people '			2
but a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian 's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste			1
' from what @entity7 has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject , ' said @entity151 , specialist abuse lawyer at @entity153			2
' after meeting with him and discussing the project at length , i 'm satisfied he will not cause offence to any of the victims			0
in fact some have agreed to meet with him			0
' an audience with @entity4 is the author 's second play			2
his first , @entity162 , is being shown at the @entity163			0
depraved : the comedian abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals , schools and television studios in the 1970s and 80s			0
