after his grand arrival into rugby union , @entity0 will prepare to enter a school of hard knocks in a ‘ padded cell ’ with @entity7 ’s back - rowers , while his new club may find themselves on a collision course with @entity10			1
the world player of the year in league was unveiled amid great fanfare at @entity14 and he handled the glare of attention with considerable aplomb , despite the jetlag induced by a long - haul trek from @entity20			1
there was ample diplomacy as he explained his cross-code move and ambitions , but the subject of his likely position in the 15 - man game kept recurring as a potential sticking point			1
@entity30 , the @entity10 head coach , would welcome the prospect of @entity0 making a late charge for @entity34 selection in midfield , and at the start of this season it appeared @entity7 were ready to co-operate by deploying him at inside centre			1
but , amid a spate of back - row injuries , now it appears they may revert to their initial intention by unleashing him at @entity45 , whether that is in the national interest or not			0
@entity0 has made the switch from rugby league to union and is being touted for a place with @entity10 @entity0 and @entity7 head coach @entity52 prepare to face the media during the player 's unveiling @entity0 was unveiled as a @entity7 player on thursday following his switch from rugby league having welcomed his new recruit , @entity7 head coach @entity52 emphasised the club ’ s right to harness his imposing presence as they see fit , having had to stump up the full transfer fee without assistance from the @entity65			1
whether or not a padded cell actually awaits @entity0 , what does is a crash - course in the breakdown and other aspects of back - row play , just in case that is where he is employed			1
asked where the newcomer would play , @entity52 said : ‘ if you want my gut feeling , i think @entity0 ’s going to play in the back row			2
i ’ve got a good relationship with @entity30 , but we have not really talked about @entity0 positionally , only “ when is he coming , is he healthy and do you need any help in the way you develop him , we can help in that respect ”			2
but the decision will be @entity7 ’s and @entity87			2
i can afford to experiment and see what the best position is			0
‘ we have quite a few back - row players injured and we have a padded cell which we will put them in over the next few weeks so the guys can take @entity0 to one side and say , “ this is how you present the ball , this is how we clear ”			1
’ the 25 - year - old played 13 times for the @entity10 rugby league side , and also played twice for @entity101 @entity30 would likely welcome @entity0 challenging for a place in the @entity10 @entity34 squad 1			1
he can be a bit of a teacher ’s pet			0
growing up watching rugby league , his favourite player was former @entity109 star @entity108 , which could be a popular choice if @entity0 is called up for @entity10 — @entity108 is the backs coach for the national team			1
he ’s not always been so keen on a cross-code switch			0
in a q&a in 2009 , the former @entity114 man was asked about whether he was concerned too many players were swapping rugby league for rugby union			1
he said : ‘ it is definitely something rugby league as a sport should be worried about			1
i played a little bit of rugby union when i was younger , but i ’m definitely on the side of league			1
he made a flying start to his league career			2
in 2007 , as a strapping 18 - year - old , he made a spectacular international debut for @entity101 , scoring in a 20 - 14 win over @entity130			1
the last 18 - year - old to score on debut against the @entity133 ? a certain @entity108			1
there is still a chance that once @entity0 is fit to start his union career after recovering from facial surgery , he will first surface at centre for @entity7 , but the uncertainty is not good news for @entity10			1
the national coaches will be desperate to see him wear no 12 as soon as possible , but the man himself was at pains to play down his test hopes — well aware it would not send out the right message at his new club to suggest he wants to run before learning to walk in the rival code			0
however , @entity10 ’s autumn internationals last year played a part in convincing him to cross the divide			0
‘ i did see the games — i was in the country , ’ he said			0
‘ i did think it was fantastic , the way it was built up at @entity157 ; it looked like a fantastic experience to be a part of			0
i guess that ’s one great thing about rugby union			2
‘ but i ’m here now as a @entity7 player			2
i ’ve been asked a lot about @entity10 but for now it ’s important to sort this face out , get some fitness back in , get in the padded cell , earn the respect of the boys and let them know i ’m here for the right reasons			0
’ outlining the motivation behind leaving league , he added : ‘ i ’ve always had an ambition to play union			2
i did n’t think it would come this early			0
i came back at the end of 2013 to play in the @entity181 and i really missed @entity10 and @entity10 people			0
a bloodied @entity0 is taken down by two opponents during the @entity185 match the @entity7 star celebrates with @entity187 ( left ) after the @entity188 won the @entity185 match @entity0 's mum @entity189 poses with her @entity188 sons ( from left to right ) @entity0 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 ‘ i saw @entity52 and @entity195 ( @entity194 — club chairman ) at @entity7 and i saw it as an opportunity			1
i believed in the vision they had for the club and thought it was a great fit			0
my goal at the moment is to get fit and find a spot in @entity52 ’s team			0
i do n’t know where that is yet			0
over time we ’ll work that out			0
’ @entity0 has made his move after some time off to recuperate from his operation , having broken a cheekbone and eye socket during his man - of - the - match contribution to the @entity188 ’ first @entity185 title in 43 years			1
he spent some time with club owner and film star @entity187 on his farm — ‘ we had a couple of beers together , we had a good time ’ — before flying home to embrace this new challenge			0
@entity0 ( right ) said goodbye to his loved ones older brother @entity191 and girlfriend @entity223 at @entity224 on tuesday ahead of his flight to @entity10 and @entity7 he declared himself at ease with the pressure which will accompany him in union and backed his ability to learn a whole new ball game			1
‘ it is not going to be an easy transition , ’ said the man known as @entity232 ’ @entity0			1
‘ but i do n’t lack belief			0
’ there has been contact with the @entity10 coaches , but @entity0 played down the significance of their conversations			2
he said @entity30 had merely called him a few times to say ‘ @entity244 ’ and his mistaken use of the @entity247 phrase brought a laugh			0
it will take time to acclimatise to being back in this country , let alone being in the other code			0
asked if any of his three brothers who are still at the @entity188 might be tempted to head home and turn their hands to union , @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t think so ! @entity256 and @entity192 are living on @entity258 beach and loving it in @entity247			1
my oldest brother ( @entity191 ) has settled down and has a family in @entity20			2
’ so @entity0 appears to be the only member of the clan who will make this leap into the unknown , at least for the time being			2
but for @entity7 and for @entity10 , wherever he ends up playing , this big brother could be a revelation			0
