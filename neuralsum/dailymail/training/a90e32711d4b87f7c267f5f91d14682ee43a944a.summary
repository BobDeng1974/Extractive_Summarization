she is his daughter and he was simply being protective			0
after the attacks he showed genuine signs of regret , cuddling up to me			0
’ mrs @entity9 added : ‘ many people might have had @entity21 put to sleep			1
you would n’t put a child down just because it lashed out in temper			0
so why do people think differently about a dog ? ’ she and her gas fitter husband @entity40 , 39 , who have no children , bought @entity21 as a puppy			1
he was no trouble until last february when @entity46 – @entity21 ’s pup by a friend ’s bullmastiff – came to live at their house in @entity37 , @entity38			1
as mrs @entity9 told @entity46 off for chewing the vinyl floor in the kitchen , @entity21 lunged at her and sank his teeth into her forearm			1
she was treated at hospital but left to be with her dog			2
' doctors wanted to keep me in , ' she said			0
' but i went home because i knew @entity21 would be like a frightened child worrying where mummy had gone – and he was full of remorse			2

’ she had 24 stitches to her face and more than 40 to her arm			0
the couple discussed having @entity21 put down but mr @entity101 said : ‘ although i was so upset about what @entity21 did to @entity9 , neither of us could do it			1
’ in september , @entity21 attacked mrs @entity9 again and she needed surgery to save the movement in her left hand			1
but she claimed : ‘ @entity21 is n’t aggressive – he was just overprotective			2
we ’ve now solved this by ensuring he ’s always behind a gate if i have to tell @entity46 off			0

' mrs @entity9 insists @entity21 is no danger to the public			1
‘ i do n’t muzzle him because he ’s never gone for anyone else			0
