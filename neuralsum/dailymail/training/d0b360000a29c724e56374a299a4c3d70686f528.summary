by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 last updated at 4:20 pm on 29th december 2011 the nationwide @entity4 shopping spree has renewed fears of an alarming increase in personal debt as @entity8 get carried out with the euphoria of bargain hunting			1
debt advice organisations are today bracing themselves for a huge upsurge in consumers admitting to money problems after drastically overspending their festive budget			1
some £ 2.5billion passed through the tills yesterday on top of an estimated £ 1.8billion on @entity20			1
retail analysts believe the combined final total will be the highest ever spend for december 26 and december 27			0
bargain hunters flock to @entity24 today as the post-christmas sales boom continues			0
debt advice organisations are bracing themselves for an upsurge in consumers admitting to money problems no end in sight : some £ 2.5billion passed through tills yesterday on top of an estimated £ 1.8billion on @entity20 financial analysts today warned that the @entity4 buying experience can easily get out of hand as people spend huge sums of money			1
over 60 per cent of people are struggling to pay for @entity4 this year and over a quarter will end up with debts because of @entity4 spending , according to @entity41			1
on average the festive financial hangover will last almost 6 months as people strive to pay off their @entity4 bills , but almost one in ten will still be clearing their debts next @entity4			0
in order to put presents under the tree and food on the table , more than half will dip into their savings while over a third of savvy consumers will use up hard - earned shopping vouchers or reward points			1
of particular concern though is that over 40 per cent will have @entity4 on credit this year , with 4 per cent taking out new credit especially to fund @entity4			0
a further 16 per cent will sell possessions in order to get the @entity4 cash they need and 3 per cent will borrow from friends and family ( although with personal finances under pressure , many friends will not be in a position to lend money even if they want to )			1
@entity74 , personal finance expert at @entity41 , said : ' if you 're struggling with your festive finances , and are thinking of turning to credit , i would urge you to use credit cards sensibly			0
' putting your spending on a card with 0 per cent on purchases could give you some breathing space			1
' but the mass spending has been greeted with gloom by debt experts who fear that many people have gone back on their pledge not to use their credit cards to snap up sales bargains			1
there are growing concerns that large numbers of @entity8 will go into 2012 burdened by mountains of extra debts that they have no realistic chance of repaying			2
not only are some risking being in debt next @entity4 , they are still in debt from last @entity4			2
cash - strapped shoppers will slash nearly £ 1billion from spending on non-essential goods such as electrical items , furniture and carpets next year			1
retail sales are expected to grow by just 1.2 per cent to £ 295.3billion in 2012 - their third slowest year of growth in the past four decades - spelling more pain for the sector , according to a report by leading retail research firm verdict			1
sales of groceries will grow by 3.3 per cent as consumers eat more meals at home to save money , but spending on non-food items is set to shrink by about 0.5 per cent as the change in attitudes - from extravagant to austere - continues			1
that would mean retail non-food sales will have fallen by £ 9.5billion since the recession of 2008			2
electricals , furniture , floor coverings , diy and gardening goods will be hardest hit , with sales down by about £ 900million , and are unlikely to improve until mid- 2013			2
clothing and footwear will grow by just 2.4 per cent , or £ 14 extra per person , as a result of higher prices , but the rise in youth unemployment will hit fashion retailers			2
the report , compiled in conjunction with business analysis firm @entity140 , will add to fears that major retailers are in danger of collapsing in coming weeks amid unprecedented levels of price reductions			0
among the most vulnerable are lingerie chain @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
stores across the country saw scenes reminiscent of those before the economic downturn as thousands of people flocked to the sales			0
from left to right : @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 enjoy a spot of shopping in @entity161 crowded : consumers all over the @entity8 have flocked to shopping centres , such as @entity164 in @entity161 they were taking an average of at least £ 4.6million a minute , or £ 77,000 a second			2
experts said the predicted £ 10billion plus spend for the whole of this week will be 2011 's most lucrative for retailers , beating the pre-christmas rush			2
consumers are expected to have spent at least £ 22.8billion by the third week of january - £ 338million more than in the equivalent @entity173 period last year			1
@entity174 , an analyst at @entity175 , said : ' it 's good to see so many people visiting stores and the milder weather has helped			0
with retailers ' quarterly rent due , the difficulty is that they are selling a lot of stock at very low prices			0
' what remains to be seen is if this quarter 's takings are enough to see them through this difficult period to the next quarter			0
' the peak weeks of @entity4 trading are crucial to retailers as this period accounts for nearly one - fifth of the @entity8 retail industry 's annual sales , making stores fight harder than ever to tempt shoppers through their doors			1
the beleaguered retail sector has suffered from poor footfall figures during the course of the year			0
high street takings were down by around £ 200million a week in november versus october			2
many retail managers have complained once - thriving shopping centres have come to resemble ghost towns			2
shoppers crowd the @entity209 doorway yesterday morning as the @entity211 store opened its @entity4 sale bargain hunters : shoppers at the @entity209 winter sale search for big discounts @entity4 sales were brought forward in many stores with discounts increasing on a daily basis			1
many stores are now offering 70 per cent or more off items			0
@entity222 , manager of @entity211 's @entity224 shopping centre , said @entity20 had been the busiest ever – following on from a record breaking december 23 and @entity226			1
he said : ' we have broken three records in three days in terms of numbers , with each of the last three days being the biggest ever for the time of year			0
' industry insiders , however , say that despite the encouraging trading , some big - name players may not make it through the next few weeks , with many now due to pay their rent bills for the next quarter			2
@entity147 , which has 146 stores and 18 concessions in the @entity8 , has announced it plans to enter administration in coming days			0
and @entity148 , which owns 98 blacks outlets and 208 millets stores , has fuelled speculation that it would go into administration in a move that would allow rivals to cherry - pick its best assets			0
people rummage through handbags at @entity209 yesterday as thousands descended on the @entity253 department store last week chocolate - maker @entity254 said annual profits would miss estimates , while music chain @entity257 said weak sales may cast ' significant doubt ' on its future			1
up to 12million shoppers – one in four of the population aged over ten – were thought to have crammed into high streets and malls yesterday			1
@entity265 , @entity209 and @entity266 all joined the retail frenzy , launching in - store sales on top of those already started online			1
high shopper numbers and busy traffic were reported at centres across @entity8 , including @entity274 in @entity275 , the @entity276 in @entity277 and the @entity278 in @entity279			0
professor @entity280 , director of the @entity281 , said : ' i do n't think we 're stretching it to say the 26th and 27th of december combined have been the best ever , certainly if we include online sales			0
i 'd have thought it could be a record two - day takings			0
' people have definitely been waiting for the sales			0
many decided to play a waiting game with retailers in anticipation of deep sales cuts			0
because of the way @entity4 has fallen and the fact that many people have taken the whole week off that has prompted a huge boost in spending			1

debt advice organisations are bracing for a huge upsurge in calls
£ 2.5bn passed through tills yesterday , on top of £ 1.8m on @entity20
cash - strapped shoppers will cut £ *1bn* spending on non-essentials in 2012
