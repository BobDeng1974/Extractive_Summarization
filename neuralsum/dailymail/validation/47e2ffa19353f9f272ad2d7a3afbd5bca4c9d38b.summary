waist training is all the rage these days , with stars such as @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 all giving it a go			1
but one woman has taken taken the fad to extreme levels			0
@entity11 achieved an eye - watering 20 - inch waist - wearing a corset 23 hours a day			1
the busty model , from @entity15 , @entity16 , has been wearing the waist - shrinking garment for the last six years and even refers to it as her second skin			1
@entity11 said : ' i am completely obsessed with belts and corsets - i even sleep with them on			1
' i love the feeling of pressure and only take it off for an hour a day to rest and to wash myself			2
' the 25 - year - old model began waist - training while still in her teens and now with her enhanced 34dd breasts she draws stares wherever she goes			1
she said : ' people stop what they 're doing and stare - everywhere i go i get attention			2
' people shout at me in the street - they ca n't believe that my figure is real			0
but wearing a corset took some getting used to - at first it was terrible and uncomfortable			1
' after a while it became a necessity and when i 'm not wearing it my skin would itch			2
but it 's not pain - it 's more pleasure , i like the pressure			0
i do n't feel a thing , it does n't bother me at all			0
' @entity11 's doctors have said that her extreme waist - training could lead to complications later in life in this shot it is clear to see how much smaller @entity11 's waist is to the rest of her body but @entity11 's doctor fears that her stringent regime could lead to complications later on in life			1
dr @entity72 , said : ' in my medical opinion she should stop this @entity75 @entity74 she has not done any damage so far but she should stop before it 's too late			1
' it happens because the floating ribs at the bottom of the rib cage are easier to mold - it 's definitely possible to achieve this waist without surgery			2
' along with the waist training , @entity11 tries to keep her hourglass shape by eating right and dieting			1
she added : ' i only eat very small portions mainly egg whites , pineapple , lots of fruit and a little bit of meat - i have a very balanced diet			0
i do crunches , weights and whatever i can to stay in shape			0
' but a strict corset regime and a healthy lifestyle can only go so far in gaining a cartoonlike body			1
@entity11 hopes she will become famous because of her tiny waist which she shows off her in a sequin jumpsuit @entity11 regularly wears tight fitting clothes which show off her tiny waist wherever she goes @entity11 attracts stares from on - lookers who are confused by her figure she added : ' i have to admit that i have had some surgery			1
i 've had my nose done and my breasts three times			0
i 've also had buttock implants and some liposuction - so quite a bit			0
' unsurprisingly she draws both adulation and criticism whenever she hits the streets of @entity15 in @entity16 - with people even comparing her to an alien			0
she said : ' they say that i 've had too much surgery , that i do n't have ribs and that i 'm a man			0
it is totally false - people even say that i am an extraterrestrial and a transsexual			0
' but she considers wearing a corset for 23 hours a day a small price to pay for the happiness it brings her			1
she added : ' this is the best thing that has happened to me			0
i would like to be known for my waist , not for having the smallest waist in the world but rather for my waist and my entire body			1
' that would be one of my ambitions , to be very well known for the shape of my body			2
other than having a small waist i also want to be considered sexy			2
' recently @entity150 star @entity149 came under fire for having worn a corset during the filming of the new film			2
actress @entity149 has come under fire for wearing a corset in the new @entity150 film which has given her a tiny waist many have commented that the characters waist is too small and gives young viewers unrealistic expectations of how they should look			1
@entity149 even admitted that she could n't eat properly during filming saying : ' when [ the corset ] was on we would be on continuous days , so we would n't stop for lunch or a lovely tea like this			2
you 'd be sort of eating on the move			0
in that case , i could n't untie the corset			0
' if you ate food it did n't really digest properly , and i 'd be burping all afternoon in [ @entity175 's ] face , and it was just really sort of unpleasant			0
i 'd have soup so that i could still eat but it would n't get stuck			0
' in another interview she admitted : ' i have naturally a quite small waist ... and on top of that i have a corset that was pulled me [ within an ] inch of my life … and then the skirt is so big that the perspective and the proportions make it look smaller than it is			1
