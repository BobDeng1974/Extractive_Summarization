@entity0 inspired terrorists in @entity2 are ' just a few hours flying time ' from striking @entity4 ' and want to attack us ' , home secretary @entity3 said tonight			1
mrs may said @entity8 fighters had carved out a ' safe haven ' in the @entity10 - with ' advanced technology and weapons ' capable of threatening the @entity4			1
she said the terror threat was now ' on the doorstep of @entity15 ' and was the most serious since 9/11			0
mrs may also revealed that some women are among the 400 radicals that have left the @entity4 to fight in @entity19			1
home secretary @entity3 tonight launched an impassioned defence of the security services and warned the threat faced by @entity4 was serious the home secretary 's dramatic warning is reminiscent of @entity26 's infamous claim that @entity27 was just 45 minutes away from hitting @entity4 in the run up to the 2003 invasion of @entity2			1
but the home secretary , speaking at the lord mayor 's annual security and defence lecture at @entity34 's @entity33 , said the terror threats against @entity4 are ' considerable '			1
she also reiterated her demand for fresh powers to monitor people 's internet like emails and skype calls to keep tabs on terrorists			1
deputy prime minister @entity44 has blocked any further extension of the government 's powers to monitor people 's communications			1
but mrs may said : ' we need to make changes to the law to maintain the capabilities we need			0
' ' this is quite simply a question of life and death , a matter of national security			0
we must keep on making the case until we get the changes we need			0
' mrs may revealed she was now signing off spying warrants every week for the police and security services to monitor @entity4 based terrorists planning to travel to fight in the @entity10			1
she said around ' 400 @entity4 linked individuals ' have gone to fight in @entity19 include ' many young men but also some women '			1
but she said the security services were working with their hands tied behind their back because they did not have the power to monitor the internet properly			2
she said the web was becoming ' a safe haven for terrorism and criminality '			1
mrs may said the ' danger is already upon us '			0
the home secretary said : ' we no longer have capabilities upon which we have always relied			1
' let me give one example			0
over a six - month period the @entity82 alone estimates that it has had to drop at least twenty cases as a result of missing communications data			0
' thirteen of these were threat - to - life cases in which a child was assessed to be at risk of imminent harm			0
' she added : ' the real problem is not that we have built an over-mighty state but that the state is finding it harder to fulfil its most basic duty , which is to protect the public			2
@entity103 fighters in @entity2 and @entity19 are no longer just a threat to towns and cities in the @entity10 - they also plan to attack @entity4 , according to the home secretary @entity103 has carved out an safe haven to attack @entity4 from ' just a few hours ' away , @entity3 warned tonight mrs may said the government had been criticised for ' overstating the threats we face '			1
but she said : ' we need to remember some facts			0
between september 2001 and the end of 2013 , more than 2,500 people were arrested for terrorist offences in this country			0
' almost 400 people have been convicted for terrorism - related offences			0
we have disrupted more than one major attack in this country each year since 2005 and many more overseas			0
mrs may 's warning is reminiscent of the now - discredited claim that @entity27 could hit @entity4 in 45 minutes she added : ' the terrorist threats to this country and our interests are changing faster than at any time since 9/11			2
' we continue to face possible attacks by @entity0 in @entity125 and @entity126			0
' but we face further threats from @entity19 and now from @entity2 where @entity0 , @entity103 and others have created a safe haven with substantial resources including advanced technology and weapons			1
' they are on the doorstep of @entity15 , just a few hours flying time from @entity34 , and they want to attack us – not just in @entity19 or @entity2 but here in @entity4			1
mrs may revealed that ' many hundreds of people from our country have travelled to @entity19 to fight against the @entity140 regime '			2
she said : ' they have ended up fighting for terrorist groups , often against other parts of the opposition rather than against the @entity19 government			2
' some of them will present a real danger to us when they return to @entity4			2
the investigation of these people will require all of our sensitive capabilities and the skills and resources of the agencies and police			0
' it will involve the further use of the powers i have through the @entity160 to remove people ’s passports to stop them travelling – and in a smaller number of cases , i am prepared to use my powers to deprive people with dual citizenship of their @entity4 nationality			2
