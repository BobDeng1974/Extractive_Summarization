@entity0 lay inert on the turf for a moment			1
he realised the magnitude of what happened			0
he understood the horror of it instantly			0
he let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away , as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the @entity15 fans			1
his face was scrunched against the grass , distorted in a mask of despair			0
@entity20 , still struggling to avoid relegation to @entity22 , had performed heroically to push @entity15 into extra-time in this @entity26 semi-final and @entity0 had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1 - 1 but the @entity30 goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now			1
there had been less than a minute to go before the extra-time interval when @entity35 had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at @entity38			1
he knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it			1
it was football at its most cruel			0
in years to come , it will be the enduring image of this game			0
@entity35 's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of @entity20 goalkeeper @entity0 in extra time it was a routine shot from @entity35 but the @entity20 stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe the ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game @entity0 tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp @entity20 had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties @entity38 lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the @entity26 semi-final against @entity15 the @entity20 goalkeeper , who had been magnificent until then , left the field in tears as manager @entity74 tries to console him @entity0 's opposite number , @entity76 ( left ) of @entity15 comforts his fellow goalkeeper after the game is resolved @entity20 : @entity0 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity86 ( @entity85 , 106 ) , @entity87 ( @entity88 , 90 ) , @entity89 , @entity91 ( @entity90 , 111 )			1

goals : @entity35 39 , 106 when the final whistle confirmed that it would be @entity15 who will face either @entity120 or @entity121 here at the end of next month , @entity0 , 30 , put his head down and began to walk purposefully from the pitch , his thoughts fixed on some form of escape , some search for sanctuary			1
the @entity20 manager , @entity74 , tried to console him but he was inconsolable			1
as he disappeared down the tunnel , he hung his head and wept			0
sure , the bigger picture was that @entity15 now have a chance to become the most successful club in the history of this competition by winning it for the second year in succession			1
the bigger picture is that this time , their success in the @entity26 seems less like a consolation prize and more like a gateway to a new period of glories at a club that had been starved of them until last season ’s cup final victory over @entity147			2
but above all , this was the kind of human drama that peoples this competition and adds to its legend			0
‘ i am happy we are through , ’ said @entity15 goalkeeper @entity76			1
‘ but i thought @entity0 was terrific today			1
he had the game of his life and they only got to extra-time because of him			0
he was the best player on the pitch			0
i really feel for him — i have been there , done that			0
’ @entity74 did his best to ease @entity0 ’s pain , too			1
‘ this is the life of a goalkeeper , ’ said the @entity20 boss			1
‘ and @entity0 is a top goalkeeper			1
there ’s every chance he ’ll be @entity20 ’s player of the season this year			1
his performances in the @entity170 have been crucial			0
‘ we stick by him			0
i understand his worth and the supporters understand how important he is			0
@entity0 is a strong character as well			2
he ’ll take his disappointment on the chin and on wednesday night when we play @entity176 i ’m sure he ’ll be as good as he always is			2
’ @entity74 also complained that refereeing decisions had counted against his team			0
he had some justification but nothing can dull the memory of how his side pushed @entity15 all the way			2
there were times when it seemed @entity188 ’s team , who had been pegged back by the @entity190 in normal time , might be overwhelmed by the sheer relentless refusal of their opponents to accept defeat and by a team spirit that would not fade			2
the match became a test of @entity15 ’s fortitude as well as their class			2
in former years , they might have buckled			0

they had nearly taken an early lead when @entity100 rose to meet a corner at the near post and @entity0 had to dive smartly to his left to push it off the line			1
later , he produced a stunning one - handed stop to keep out a header from @entity101			0
@entity20 held firm but @entity15 started to exert more and more pressure			1
@entity108 , in particular , was a delight to watch in possession			2
there are increasing signs that the @entity241 is finally beginning to find his best form and he beguiled @entity20 with a series of sweet turns and beautifully measured passes			2
seven minutes before the interval , @entity15 broke the stalemate			1
it was @entity108 , inevitably , who was the inspiration			2
he collected the ball midway inside the @entity20 half , took time to pick his pass and flighted a curling ball to @entity35 in the box			1
@entity35 did the rest , although the rest was not simple			2
he controlled the ball on his chest with his back to goal , turned and committed @entity260 by shaping to shoot			0
then , with time , the @entity261 forward prodded the ball past @entity0 and wheeled away to celebrate			1
@entity101 ( right ) , a replacement for @entity100 , powers a header at goal shortly after @entity20 had scored but @entity20 goalkeeper @entity0 made a splendid one - handed save to tip the ball up and against the crossbar @entity35 ( centre ) earlier took the ball past goalkeeper @entity0 ( second left ) before losing his footing and falling @entity84 ( left ) shoots at goal for @entity20 against @entity15 at @entity215 but his attempt went wide of the goal it seemed then that @entity15 would extend their lead			1
@entity20 ’s threat had been negligible			2
but they came out for the second half with new belief and to the delight of their fans massed behind the goal , they forced an equalizer			2
@entity91 must take a lot of the credit for squeezing in a cross when it looked as though he had run out of space near the byline			0
the ball drifted over @entity291 ’ head and as @entity76 scrambled across his line , @entity83 volleyed the ball back across him			1
@entity76 got his hands to it but he had not been able to prevent it crossing the line			0
suddenly , @entity20 wanted more			2
@entity89 clipped a lovely chip into the path of @entity300 on the edge of the box			0
it fell to him nicely but @entity84 sliced his volley wildly wide			0
the game was harum - scarum now			0
@entity89 urged the fans on and they roared back			0
but six minutes from the end of normal time , @entity20 escaped when @entity107 missed an open goal , crashing a left - foot shot against the post			1
@entity107 held his head in his hands			0
