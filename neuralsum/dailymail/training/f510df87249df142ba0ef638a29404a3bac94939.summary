@entity48 pictured above at the @entity50 in september 2012 word of the withdrawal of more @entity1 personnel came on the day that @entity4 president @entity48 stepped down , throwing the country deeper into chaos days after @entity58 - backed @entity57 rebels battled their way into his presidential palace			1

@entity126 claimed responsibility for deadly attacks in @entity136 early this month			0
the events in @entity4 will ' absolutely ' limit @entity1 drone strikes and counter-terrorism operations in the country in the short - term , a former senior @entity1 official said			2

' they hate @entity10 , ' said the official , referring to the @entity120			0
' but they also hate the @entity1			0
' some @entity1 officials believe that while the @entity120 are determined to wield more power in @entity4 the movement may not want to assume responsibility for actually governing the divided , impoverished country			1
but overall the @entity18 administration appears to have few contacts with the @entity120 and remains concerned that their emergence as the country 's main powerbrokers will mean greater influence for @entity58 in @entity4 's affairs , a prospect that also worries neighboring @entity167 power @entity165			1
