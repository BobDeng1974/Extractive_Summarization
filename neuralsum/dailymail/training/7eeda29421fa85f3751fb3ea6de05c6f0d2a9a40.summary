fielding annoying questions from relatives during the holidays is pretty much unavoidable , but one cocky teenager has come up with an inventive solution to silence those annoying relatives by handing them a pamphlet of pre-prepared answers			1
when @entity8 , a 17 - year - old from @entity10 , @entity11 , sat down for @entity12 last month she proceeded to hand out her carefully printed hand - out which included answers to the boring generic questions that she just was n't prepared to answer at the dinner table			1
the leaflet covered hot topics for the teenager including what college she might attend , if she has a boyfriend and her age			0
the three - page pamphlet was entitled ' frequently asked questions ' and included a smiling pic of @entity27 looking her best on the front cover			1
@entity8 , a 17 - year - old from @entity10 , @entity11 , has come up with an inventive solution to silence those annoying relatives by handing them a pamphlet of pre-prepared answers to their boring generic questions @entity33 was a message explaining the purpose behind the hand - out			1
' if you refrain from asking me these questions that i have nicely provided you the answers to , we will have a happy and loving thanksgiving			2
thank you , ' she wrote			0
@entity8 then went on to answer the boring questions with a certain amount of sass			1
for instance in answer to questions about she age she wrote : ' i turned 17 in october			1
. yes , i know time flies			1
i have also gotten taller , that happens when you grow up			2
' the original idea came from her mom she recent explained			0
' i was talking to my mom about how much i hate answering the same five questions over and over during the holidays , so she hinted that i just make a handout for my family , ' the teen told @entity65			0
' she was beyond shocked when i actually followed through with her idea			0
' @entity8 produced her debut pamphlet just before @entity12 dinner and it seemed to go down a winner			1
' when i handed them out on @entity12 , it was more of a gag joke than anything else			2
everyone thought the idea was great and took it well , ' she explained			0
' i was surprised though , because i did n't have anything to talk about with some family members ! overall , i think the pamphlet was a hit and i loved not talking about the same things			2
' the reaction was so good in fact that she has another handout planned for the dinner table on christmas day			0
' during the holiday season , most teens get stuck answering the same questions over and over again , ' she told @entity90			0
' i realize that some people are genuinely interested in what you have to say , but sometimes i find that these generic questions are just used to fill the silences			0
i love talking to my family members , but i feel like so much time is wasted while answering repetitive questions			2
' once they move past the generic pleasantries , @entity99 hopes that she and her relatives will be able to move on to more enjoyable and substantial topics			0
the idea proved such a hit for @entity8 at @entity12 that she will be handing out more pamphlets round the table on @entity109			1
