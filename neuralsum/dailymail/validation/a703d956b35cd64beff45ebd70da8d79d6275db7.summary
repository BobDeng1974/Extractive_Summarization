for @entity8 science correspondent @entity7 , seeing on film the aftermath of the freak accident that resulted in the amputation of his left arm above the elbow proved more difficult than he had anticipated			1
he had an early look at the documentary , @entity7 : a @entity11 , narrated by his friend , dr. @entity12			1
it premieres on @entity14 next tuesday at 9pm			1
' i was a little bit taken aback by how much it affected me emotionally , ' @entity7 said			2
' we all want to talk about this linear , analogue thing — here 's when you grieve , here 's when you do therapy , here 's where you get back to work			2
but that 's not how we all live			2
he appears on the network as an occasional analyst , such as during coverage of last spring 's missing @entity55 plane , but does most of his freelance work now for @entity57			0
he was on assignment for @entity8 in @entity59 and the @entity60 in february 2014 when a heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm			1
it caused a nasty bruise , but not enough to stop @entity7 from working			1
he wanted to finish his stories and escape for a few days on a beach			0
the following night , his pain increased and @entity7 sought medical attention			2
he was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome , a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm			1
as he was getting ready for surgery , he searched the internet for details on a diagnosis he had never heard before , and grew alarmed when words like ' life - threatening ' and ' amputation ' popped up			0
fateful trip : in febraury 2014 , @entity7 ( pictured ) traveled to @entity59 and the @entity60 to report on 3d printing when the accident occurred illusion : waking up after the amputation , @entity7 could feel his left arm , but it was only a phantom limb denial : @entity7 continued working on his stories after being discharged from the hospital and did n't tell his family back home about the amputation waking up after surgery , @entity7 's first inclination was that he caught a break			1
he could feel his left arm , the fingers on his hand			1
but it was an illusion , a phantom limb			1
he checked out of the hospital two days later and spent more than a week in a @entity60 hotel , finishing his @entity8 stories			0
in an extreme form of denial , the divorced father of two told no one what had happened , even his children			0
they were dark days , and he told @entity12 he even considered suicide			0
' i had never lost an arm before , ' he said , drily			0
' i was n't sure how that would go			0
' two weeks after the amputation , he wrote in a blog post- typed with one hand with the help of a voice recognition software : ' life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you			2
actually , i would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now — in more ways than one			0
' during an interview on the @entity132 in march 2014 , about a month after his accident , @entity7 described what happened to him as ' mind - boggling			1
' unstoppable : the 55 - year - old reporter has learned how to ride a bicycle one - handed with the help of a special contraption ( pictured ) @entity7 had never been the sort of person who reached out for help			1
and he wanted to prove to himself he could move forward and still do his job			0
when he found out about the amputation through the february blog post @entity7 had written , @entity12 was worried			1
' i was n't surprised by @entity7 ' reaction , ' he said			1
' my concern was , was this his form of therapy or was he delaying the inevitable psychological crash by not dealing with it emotionally ? ' @entity7 has tried to prove he can maintain his active life beyond work , with some missteps			2
he started running , but losing an arm affected his balance and he took some nasty spills			0
he broke his nose one time when he reached to break his fall with an arm that was no longer there			1
a woman who came upon him was horrified — look what happened to his arm ! — and @entity7 had to explain he did n't lose it in the fall			1
with the help of a prosthetic arm , he completed a 300 - mile bike ride to honor his late sister , @entity12 pedaling by his side			0
the licensed pilot has also been testing out how to fly again with his new disability			0
growing pains : the divorced father of two has been learning how to perform simple everyday tasks like cutting a bagel and getting dressed on his own he 's learning about the oddities of pain in a phantom limb , how to work with new prosthetics and how to negotiate simple tasks — getting dressed , cutting a bagel — that he never had to think twice about before			1
when filming the @entity14 special , @entity7 knew what @entity12 was up to when his friend asked him to read on camera some of the emails that @entity12 had sent to him a year ago			1
he was trying to make him cry			0
the emotional journey , still not completed , has been one of self - discovery			0
he 's learned that there 's no weakness in asking for help			0
he realizes what loved ones and even strangers think of him , and it has been overwhelming			0
' if i had to trade it — that arm for the knowledge and the love that i feel ? ' he said			2
' i 'll go with the love			0
it 's a hell of a way to learn a lesson			2
