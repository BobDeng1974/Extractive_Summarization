in his two most important shows , @entity15 , 1950 - 54 , and @entity16 , 1954 - 57 , @entity0 displayed remarkable skill in pantomime , satire , mimicry , dialect and sketch comedy			1
and he gathered a stable of young writers who went on to worldwide fame in their own right - including @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity28 : @entity0 was one of the driving forces of what many television critis refer to as ' the @entity28 of comedy ' ' the one great star that television created and who created television was @entity0 , ' said critic @entity37 on the tv documentary @entity39 ! the @entity40 , which first aired in 2001			1
while best known for his tv shows , which have been revived on @entity43 in recent years , he also had success on @entity45 and occasional film appearances , notably in it 's a @entity47			2
if the typical funnyman was tubby or short and scrawny , @entity0 was tall and powerful , with a clown 's loose limbs and rubbery face , and a trademark mole on his left cheek			1
but @entity0 never went in for clowning or jokes			1
he insisted that the laughs come from the everyday			0
' real life is the true comedy , ' he said in a 2001 interview with the @entity61			2
' then everybody knows what you 're talking about			0
' @entity0 brought observational comedy to tv before the term , or such latter - day practitioners as @entity69 , were even born			1
in one celebrated routine , @entity0 impersonated a gumball machine ; in another , a baby ; in another , a ludicrously overemotional guest on a parody of @entity73			1
he played an unsuspecting moviegoer getting caught between feuding lovers in a theater			0
he dined at a health food restaurant , where the first course was the bouquet in the vase on the table			0
he was interviewed as an avant - garde jazz musician who seemed happily high on something			2
the son of @entity89 immigrants , @entity0 was a wizard at spouting melting - pot gibberish that parodied @entity94 , @entity92 , @entity93 and other languages			1
his professor was the epitome of goofy @entity98 scholarship			0
some compared him to @entity100 for his success at combining humor with touches of pathos			0
legend : two - time @entity106 winner @entity0 died wednesday at age 91 ' as wild an idea as you get , it wo n't go over unless it has a believable basis to start off with , ' he told @entity61 in 1955			1
' the viewers have to see you basically as a person first , and after that you can go on into left field			0
' @entity0 performed with such talents as @entity117 and @entity118 , but his most celebrated collaborator was the brilliant @entity4 , his " @entity15 " co-star			1
@entity4 and @entity0 performed skits that satirized the everyday - marital spats , inane advertising , strangers meeting and speaking in clich√©s , a parody of the @entity127 in which the hero was @entity129			1
they staged a water - logged spoof of the love scene in @entity134			2
the @entity136 husband - and - wife skits became a staple			2
' the chemistry was perfect , that 's all , ' @entity4 , who died in 2001 , once said			2
' we never went out together ; we never see each other socially			0
but for years we worked together from 10 in the morning to 6 or 7 at night every day of the week			0
what made it work is that we found the same things funny			0
' @entity0 worked closely with his writing staff as they found inspiration in silent movies , foreign films and the absurdities of ` 50s postwar prosperity			1
@entity15 : @entity0 's sketch comedy partner @entity4 ( right ) says the two worked well together because they ' found the same things funny ' among those who wrote for @entity0 : @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity26 and his brother @entity156 , and @entity27 , who was providing gags to @entity0 and other entertainers while still in his teens			1

a 1996 roundtable discussion among @entity0 and his writers was turned into a public television special			1
said @entity26 , the @entity176 - winning playwright : ' none of us who 've gone on to do other things could have done them without going through this show			1
' ' this was playing for the @entity183 ; this was playing in @entity186 's band , ' said @entity155 , the creator of tv 's m - a - @entity187 and screenwriter of @entity190 , who died in 2009			2
increasing ratings competition from @entity193 's variety show put ' @entity16 ' off the air in 1957			2
in 1962 , @entity0 starred on @entity45 in the musical @entity195 , written by @entity26 , and was nominated for a @entity196			1
he played seven different roles , from a comically perfect young man to a tyrannical movie director to a prince of an impoverished @entity202 kingdom			0

' in comedy , @entity0 is still the best there is			1
' @entity212 : @entity0 helped launch the careers of legendary comedians and tv writers like @entity154 and @entity155 his and @entity4 's classic tv work captured a new audience with the 1973 theatrical compilation film @entity219			1
he was one of the galaxy of stars who raced to find buried treasure in the 1963 comic epic ' it 's a @entity47 , and in 1976 he put his pantomime skills to work in @entity154 ' silent movie.but he later looked back on those years as painful ones			0
he said he beat a severe , decades - long barbiturate and alcohol habit in 1978 , when he was so low he considered suicide			2
' i had to come to terms with myself			0
" yes or no ? do you want to live or die ? ' " deciding that he wanted to live , he recalled , was ' the first step on a long journey			0
' @entity0 was born in 1922 in @entity236 , @entity237 , the third son of an @entity240 - born restaurant owner and his @entity92 - born wife			1
his first dream was to become a musician , and he played saxophone in bands in his teens			0
but as a youngster waiting tables at his father 's luncheonette , he liked to observe as well as serve the diverse clientele , and recognize the humor happening before his eyes			0
emmy : @entity0 , seen here with @entity256 ( seated ) and @entity257 won two @entity106 over the course of his 60 - year career his talent for comedy was discovered when he was serving in the @entity262 during @entity263 and got a part in a @entity262 musical , @entity266 and @entity267			1
he also appeared in the movie version			0
wrote famed columnist @entity269 : ' i hear the picture 's good , with @entity0 a four - way threat			1
he writes , sings , dances and makes with the comedy			2
' that led to a few other film roles , nightclub engagements , and then his breakthrough hit , a 1948 @entity45 revue called @entity281			0
his first tv comedy - variety show , ' the admiral @entity283 , ' premiered in february 1949			2
but it was off the air by june			0
its fatal shortcoming : unimagined popularity			0
it was selling more @entity284 television sets than the company could make , and @entity284 , its exclusive sponsor , pulled out			0
but everyone was ready for @entity0 's subsequent efforts			2
@entity15 , which debuted in february 1950 , and @entity16 three years later reached as many as 60 million viewers weekly and earned its star $ 1 million annually at a time when $ 5 , he later noted , bought a steak dinner for two			1
rip : @entity0 , whose wife of 67 years died in 2010 , leaves behind three children when @entity16 left the air in 1957 , @entity0 was only 34			1
but the unforgiving cycle of weekly television had taken a toll : his reliance on booze and pills for sleep every night so he could wake up and create more comedy			2
it took decades for him to hit bottom			0
in 1977 , he was onstage in @entity313 , @entity314 , doing @entity26 's ' @entity315 when , suddenly , his mind went blank			2
he walked off stage , checked into a hospital and went cold turkey			0
recovery had begun , with the help of wife @entity322 , who would be by his side for more than 60 years and helped him weather his demons			0
those demons included remorse about the flared - out superstardom of his youth - and how the pressures nearly killed him			0
but over time he learned to view his life philosophically			0
' you think just because something good happens , then something bad has got to happen ? not necessarily , ' he said with a smile in 2003 , pleased to share his hard - won wisdom : ' two good things have happened in a row			0
