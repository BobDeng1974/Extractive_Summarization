energy firm @entity0 has announced a price cut of just 1.3 per cent – less than 18p a week - on gas tariffs energy firm @entity0 has announced a puny price cut of just 1.3per cent – less than 18p a week - in a devastating snub to customers			1
the reduction on gas tariffs is worth a saving of just £ 9 on the average annual household energy bill and is tiny in the context of a sharp fall in wholesale energy prices			1
wholesale gas prices are down by around 28per cent in a year and electricity by 15per cent , which could deliver annual savings of £ 140 if they were passed on in full			1
@entity0 , which is a subsidiary of a power company owned by the @entity21 government , is the last of the ‘ big six ’ suppliers to announce a cut in tariffs in the last two weeks			1
earlier reductions of around 5per cent and less by the other five – @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 – have all been derided as too little and too late			0
however , none have done so little as @entity0 with a reduction that is so small as to make no real difference to the one million customers on standard variable rate tariffs who will receive it			2
at the same time customers will not get the benefit of the reduction until february 11 and after the snow storms predicted for the next few days have passed			0
@entity0 ’s minuscule price cut also represents a snub to the chancellor @entity47 and other ministers , who have demanded energy firms pass on falls in their costs to customers			1
mr @entity47 , who recently took to @entity53 to say it was ‘ vital ’ that the price cuts are passed , has ordered a @entity57 investigation to make sure this happens			2
the tiny reduction announced by @entity0 suggests the company does not expect any kind of sanction			2
the company defended the small reduction saying that it was unable to cut further because it had bought a lot of gas and electricity at the high prices that existed before the falls over the past year			2
other companies have tried to blame @entity71 and its pledge to freeze prices until 2017 should the party win the @entity75 in may for the smaller than warranted reductions			0
the firms suggest that they are unable to cut deeper because they fear being locked into low prices that will hit their profits over the long term			0
the conservative energy and business minister @entity83 suggested the recent price cuts , including the one from @entity0 , were ‘ very encouraging ’			1
however , consumer experts condemned the energy giants for turning the screw on customers in the teeth of the winter			0
@entity91 , energy expert at @entity93 , described the 1.3per cent reduction as ‘ paltry ’			1
the reduction on gas tariffs is worth a saving of just £ 9 on the average annual household energy bill and is tiny in the context of a sharp fall in wholesale energy prices , which are down by around 28 per cent in a year he said : ‘ it was inevitable that we would see the final of the ‘ big six ’ cut its prices this week and this is truly the most underwhelming of the lot @entity116			1
on top of that , we see that bill payers will again not feel the full benefit of lower bills immediately			0
‘ @entity0 ’s customers will see overall energy bills fall by just £ 9 a year if paying by monthly direct debit – down to £ 1,155 a year			1
‘ that is an absolutely paltry price cut in comparison to the fall in wholesale prices that we have seen			1
’ he added : ‘ it ’s been frustrating to see all but one of the big six choose to delay a cut in prices			2
they have all ensured that they gain a few extra week at higher prices when energy consumption by consumers remains high in the colder weather			0
’ @entity136 , director of consumer policy at @entity138 , said the @entity0 announcement confirms that the 60per cent of households who are on variable rate tariffs are not getting a fair deal			1
‘ these meagre reductions are too little too late and must be increased to help hard - pressed consumers struggling with their energy bills this winter , ’ she said			2
she said householders must now take matters into their own hands and switched to fixed rate deals that can offer annual savings of more than £ 300 a year			0
the industry regulator @entity153 is so concerned that energy firms are charging rip - off prices that it has referred them to a full - blown inquiry by the @entity158			0
however , this will take at least six months and currently , @entity153 has no powers to force the industry to pass on a fair reductions in tariffs			0
@entity164 , director of energyhelpline.com , said : ‘ this is a price cut so small you ’d probably need a microscope to see it			1
consumers will struggle to notice it in their next energy bills			0
’ the @entity0 chief executive , @entity172 , said : ‘ we continue to look for ways to bear down on costs for customers and will offer more help to the most vulnerable , for example encouraging them to switch to fixed tariffs			1
‘ if wholesale gas prices create cost reductions which allow further price cuts these will be passed to customers as soon as possible			2
’ business and energy minister , @entity83 , said : ‘ energy bills are falling			2
it ’ s very encouraging that all major suppliers are now passing on savings from lower global gas prices			0
of course i will continue to meet with the big firms to make sure that hardworking households are getting a fair deal			0
‘ this case is by no means closed and we will be watching the global gas markets very closely , expecting to see any further savings passed on			0
’ @entity199 - @entity198 , @entity200 , said : ‘ people want to see bigger savings now and energy companies need to up their game if they want their customers to stick around			0
’ @entity206 mp , @entity71 ’s @entity207 and @entity208 , said : ‘ given wholesale gas prices have fallen by at least 20 per cent , a measly price cut of just 1.3 per cent is yet more evidence of why we need a tough new regulator with the power to ensure that energy companies pass on the full savings from falls in wholesale costs to all consumers , as @entity71 has proposed			1

energy firm @entity0 has announced price cut of just 1.3per cent on gas tariffs
reduction is worth a saving of just £ 9 on average annual household bills
