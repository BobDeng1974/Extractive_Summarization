she received sever psychological trauma and now needs counselling			0
@entity0 , 39 , was given a custodial sentence by a judge at @entity31 ( pictured ) ' you have a predilection for dressing in skirts and that is exactly what you did when you went out looking for sexual stimulation and intending to commit a sexual offence			2
' you saw this lady entering the toilet and you were attracted to her because she was wearing a skirt			1
you thought ‘ skirt ’ to yourself and that triggered this violent sexual attack			2
' she was a vulnerable lady in a public situation and you attacked her for your sexual gratification			0
it was only because she fought you off and made so much noise and commotion that you stopped and fled			0
' the public minded citizen who grabbed and tackled you and held on to you deserves commendation			0
this attack was cunning and conceived and but for her perseverance you would have completed the offence			0
' there was an element of stealth and cunning			0
it was predatory behaviour with a chilling echo of your previous offending			0
' the reports say that you acknowledge you are a high risk to women and you told the probation officer you do n’t think you will ever change			1
' you are in my view extremely dangerous			1
you are likely to re-offend with potentially incalculable consequences for the public			0
' you victims are likely to be confronted by someone wearing a skirt and tights and that is likely to impact on them even more than a stranger rape in other circumstances			1
' it was predatory behaviour with a chilling echo of your previous offending ' ' your risk of reoffending increases when you cross dress			0
