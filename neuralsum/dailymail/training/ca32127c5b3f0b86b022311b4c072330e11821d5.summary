by the time she was diagnosed , it was too late to save her february 15 , 2008 - mrs @entity5 first visited her gp complaining of fever , vomiting and aching			1
he gave her painkillers and suggested it was probably the menopause			0
february 22 , 2008 - she returned to the @entity2 as her symptoms had not improved			1

mr @entity60 said : ' @entity5 was very concerned about her symptoms but she thought she was in safe hands			2
' she was a great mum and grandmother and very family orientated , we 're all absolutely heartbroken that she 's no longer with us			0
' it 's very hard not to be angry about what happened			0
@entity5 should not have had to suffer like she did and if the cancer had been diagnosed earlier we believe we could have had longer with her			1
' we just hope that what happened to @entity5 acts as a reminder to all of us about the importance of a quick diagnosis of cervical cancer			1
' it is however still difficult to come to terms with out loss because we have never had any sort of apology or admission of responsibility to help us draw a line under everything that happened			0
' until then , i 'm not sure that we can ever truly move forward			0
' dr @entity16 today apologised for failing to detect mrs @entity5 's cancer			1

' a year after mrs @entity5 's symptoms appeared she was finally referred to a specialist at @entity38 ( pictured ) , where she was diagnosed with incurable cancer @entity102 , from @entity103 , who represented the family , said : ' this is a tragic case that has left a family devastated by the loss of a wife , mother and grandmother			1
' during out investigations an independent medical expert found that @entity5 's gp should have recognised her symptoms as typical of those experienced by cervical cancer sufferers			1
' any yet no pelvic examination was made , she was not referred to a gynaecologist and no advice was given advising her to return for further medical attention should the bleeding continue			2
' had she been referred earlier she would have avoided such a long period of pain and suffering without a diagnosis and our expert was of the opinion that on balance she would have lived for longer and had more time with her family			2
' ms @entity102 added that if her cancer had been picked up earlier , her suffering would have been ' greatly reduced and it was ' incredibly hard for all her family to see her deteriorate so quickly '			0
