buying @entity0 could become much cheaper from midnight tonight , as the @entity2 patent for the drug expires a cut - price battle for the £ 1.5billion market in @entity0 begins today after the impotence drug ’s patent expired at midnight last night			1
with prices predicted to tumble quickly to as little as a tenth of the current rate , men in need of a boost in the bedroom could be able to obtain the little blue pills for as little as 60p each			2
until now , those who do not qualify for an @entity17 prescription have faced paying up to £ 6 per tablet			1
but while expiration of the patent will make the drug more affordable , it will not make it more easily available , because men will still need a prescription – private or @entity17 – to get it			1
around a dozen companies are expected to market generic , or non-branded , versions of the impotence drug from today			1
and at least ten more have also made tablets and have permission to sell them			0
@entity32 , which developed @entity0 at its plant in @entity34 in @entity35 , has held the patent since 1990 and sold the drug at a price that allowed it to recoup the money spent on development			1
worldwide , sales are worth almost £ 1.5billion a year			0
it will be launching a non-branded version today			1
among its competitors will be @entity46 , a manufacturer of generic medicines that is the biggest supplier of drugs to the @entity17 and whose products range from cold treatments to cancer drugs			2
a spokesman for the @entity55 - based firm said : ‘ we fight cat and dog with other companies to be the first on the market when a patent expires			1
’ @entity0 is a blue , diamond - shaped pill and while the copycats will come in different shapes , sizes and colours they will all contain the same active ingredient – a substance called sildenafil			0
most will simply be marketed under that name after satisfying drug regulators that they work as well as the real thing			0
other versions of the blue pill , which will not be available under the same brand name , are predicted to be marketed from tomorrow for as little as 60p per tablet cheaper copycat versions will provide enormous savings to the @entity17 , which spends more than £ 40million a year on the medicine			1
among patients , the biggest winners will be those who do n’t qualify for pills on the @entity17 – the 150,000 or so of the 750,000 @entity2 who take @entity0 each year			2
they currently pay around £ 24 for four tablets obtained with a private prescription			0
they are being urged by @entity90 , of the @entity91 , to ensure that their doctor makes the prescription out for sildenafil			0
‘ it is those patients who will directly benefit from the price fall , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’d expect the dramatic fall to feed its way through to the private market			0
’ the @entity17 currently prescribes @entity0 only to men with underlying health problems , such as diabetes or prostate cancer			2
in the long - term , the cut in price could lead to a broadening of the criteria			0
dr @entity112 , one of the team that developed @entity0 , said cutting the price should end the market in dangerous counterfeits			0
‘ the launch of generic versions is likely to be well - received by mankind because it will reduce the cost of a medication for a disorder that has a serious impact on lifestyle , ’ he said .			1

@entity32 patent expires today , meaning that other companies can produce their own version of the *sex* - *enhancing* drug
industry experts say the market could be *flooded* with cheaper versions
the current cost to the @entity17 is £ 6 per tablet and it is *difficult* to be prescribed the medication unless suffering with serious health condition
expiration of patent will see @entity32 launching its own cheaper brand
