the champions of @entity1 were smashed into submission at @entity3 on saturday night , to further expose the vast gulf in clout between the @entity7 clubs and their rich @entity9 rivals			1
this was a brutal mismatch and a shattering result , not just for the ambitious @entity13 but for the @entity15 game as a whole			0
@entity18 ’s men are imperious in domestic rugby — leading the league by 10 points — but they were simply obliterated by the formidable top 14 giants			0
@entity23 are nigh - on invincible at home and @entity25 could do absolutely nothing to even fleetingly threaten their dominance in this raucous arena			1
even in the brief moments when the @entity13 had the temerity to work up a head of steam and go through the phases , they were pounded back in the tackle and turned over time and time again			0
@entity23 winger @entity37 ( right ) scores his second try against @entity25 what unfolded was one - way carnage			1
@entity43 wing @entity37 scoring two tries before half - time and @entity45 , the ex-bath and @entity1 full - back , capped a masterful display with a break - away try from 90 metres out			1
all the while , @entity51 kept cranking up the points tally with supreme goal - kicking			0
aside from the misery of being dumped out of the @entity57 in such emphatic fashion , the concern for the @entity13 will be that this grim rout critically damages their confidence at a key stage of the season			0
for @entity25 and @entity1 , there may also be worries over two leading forwards , as @entity67 failed to reappear after half - time and @entity69 went off , apparently suffering pain in his right knee			1
@entity45 of @entity23 dives over to score a try at the @entity3 - @entity73 it was over as a contest long before half - time			1
there was a pronounced intensity deficit between the sides from the off , with @entity25 losing the collisions and appearing somewhat sluggish in contrast to their fired up and energetic opponents			2
the procession began in the fifth minute when the @entity13 conceded an early scrum penalty			0
@entity51 landed his first shot at goal and the hosts were on their way			0
there was so much pressure from @entity23 that it was just a matter of time before the @entity25 defence was breached			1
sure enough , the first try came in the 13th minute , as @entity93 blasted clear from a lineout on the right and he released @entity96			2
@entity45 cast his magic over the saints defence to inspire comprehensive victory the @entity43 centre was tackled in the 22 by @entity101 , but the attack continued at a furious tempo and , when @entity37 carved inside off his left foot , he was half stopped , but managed to climb up off the turf , stretch and touch down			1
the try was confirmed by the @entity108 and converted by @entity51			0
it did n’t help the @entity13 ’ already bleak cause that they missed their first scoring chance			0
after @entity67 had pinched a @entity23 lineout throw , the visitors won a penalty but @entity115 was off target with the kick			2
@entity51 landed another penalty , then came the two - try barrage which buried @entity25 ’s hopes of a famous result			2
at the heart of the onslaught was @entity45			0
first , his break laid the platform for @entity126 to burst deep into enemy territory and after @entity129 was tackled short of the line , the ball was switched right and @entity51 ’ lofted pass sent @entity37 over for his second try			2
@entity25 captain @entity133 leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat @entity51 converted from a wide angle then two minutes before the break , the blitz continued			2
@entity140 made ground in the centre , @entity96 picked out @entity45 and he raced into space , drew the last defender and passed back inside for the home no 12 to charge clear and touch down			1
once again , @entity51 added the extras and the @entity13 were sunk			0
after the break , @entity51 struck another penalty before @entity45 made his long - range dash to the line in the 55th minute , for another converted try			1
eventually , with @entity153 in the sin - bin , @entity152 crashed over to give @entity25 something to show for all their desperate toil , but it was far too little , far too late			1
the game was up .			0

@entity25 were *27* - 0 down at the break at the @entity3 - @entity73
@entity37 , @entity96 and @entity45 went over for @entity23
@entity152 scored a late try for the visitors on saturday night
