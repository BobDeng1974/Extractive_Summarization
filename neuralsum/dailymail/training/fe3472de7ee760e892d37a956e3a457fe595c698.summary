when stuntman @entity0 heard there was a role coming up in a @entity4 movie that would require being able to pole dance he thought he ’d give it a shot			1
the blonde - haired model , who earns a living getting run over and set on fire in films , was 21 at the time and soon realised there was an added bonus to joining his local pole dancing class in @entity20 ’s @entity19			1
‘ i copped a lot of flak from my mates until they realised i ’m a straight male in a room dancing with girls , ’ @entity0 told @entity21			1
‘ i did my first show two weeks later and did my first competition six weeks after that			0
for over a year and a half i did shows and competed in the @entity48 championships , both men ’s and doubles , ’ @entity0 explained			2
@entity0 said his friends would come to a show and then ‘ realise how good it was ’			1
‘ women were n’t the reason i joined but it was great , i did meet people through it , ’ he said			1
@entity0 performed on cruise boats , clubs and @entity20 ’s @entity61			1
@entity0 and his school friends used to train around the city including near the @entity64 , where he is pictured here he joined a gymnastics class when he was younger but quit when they would n't let him do flips asked how women react to his pole dancing he said : ‘ they love it , you do get a lot of attention			1
’ but he never felt like just a ‘ piece of meat ’			0
‘ we joke about me being objectified but i ’m not really			0
you are so comfortable with it			0
‘ there is only one backstage area so you do have people getting changed around you but the woman are n’t like “ oh no he ’s in the room ”			2
‘ it ’s up to you how you act because you are changing in a room full of women in their underwear			0
there ’s a right and a wrong way to act , ’ he reasoned			0
as well as working as a stuntman in films , tv shows and commercials @entity0 is also a model despite the associations that come with pole dancing , @entity0 thanks the sport for making him as strong as he is now his time pole dancing taught him how to do the ' flags ' move shown in the top photograph in this article , where he hangs off poles horizontally @entity0 thinks his pole dancing stint is the reason his strength is so good now			1
he describes himself as a stunt man and model first and foremost , but when his friends are around ‘ and want to have a dig ’ his pole dancing is mentioned			1
‘ they bring it up before i will , ’ he laughed			0
‘ but it ’s great fitness that ’s really all it is … it ’s a different way of moving your body and you do n’t get that strength through anything else or going to the gym			1
’ the 24 - year - old , who happens to be single , said his time pole dancing taught him how to do the ‘ flags ’ move shown in the photographs in this article , where he hangs off poles horizontally			1
@entity0 got into the stunt business after getting hooked on parkour and free - running as a 14 - year - old teenager with his two best mates , growing up in @entity135 , on the @entity136 of @entity20			1
the @entity20 , seen here by the city 's iconic @entity138 , practises his moves near his home in @entity19 after leaving school he became a qualified stuntman in 2009 and has now played parts in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 he said his parent ’s front yard is filled with old racing cars and motorbikes used for testing out his stunts @entity0 has learned all the skills he thinks he could possibly need for his work as a stuntman including ' drifting ' in cars ‘ at 16 or 17 i found out that stunts is a real job when i met a performer … i made the phone calls and did everything i could to get into it , ’ he said			1
@entity0 left school and enrolled in a stunt course which taught him how to drive like in the movies and gave him all the technical knowledge needed to avoid nasty accidents			1
by 2009 he was a fully - qualified stuntman and his parent ’s front yard was soon filled with old racing cars and motorbikes used for testing out his stunts			1
there have been cuts and bruises but @entity0 ’s still never broken a bone in his body			2
‘ @entity48 is not a huge industry and more and more people are doing it , everyone knows everybody … it ’s not just films it ’s tv and commercials , ’ he explained			2
@entity0 once jumped off a cliff for a scene in @entity185 and certainly is n't afraid of heights his work has seen him travel across @entity48 , to @entity188 in a live @entity190 show and to @entity191 for a part in the third @entity195 film a highlight of his job so far was when he partied at the @entity199 pool party in the 2013 @entity48 - @entity201 blockbuster @entity145 since starting out , he ’s travelled across @entity48 , to @entity188 in a live @entity190 show and to @entity191 for a part in @entity195 3			1
he ’s appeared on billboards for @entity206 underwear , shaved his head to be @entity208 ’s body double in upcoming sci - fi flick @entity210 and fallen down a cliff in @entity185			0
he said a highlight so far was when he partied at the @entity199 pool party in the 2013 @entity48 - @entity201 blockbuster @entity145 , starring @entity214			2
‘ you ’re not always doubling an actor and you ’re not always doing stunts … a lot of the time you are doing more than they can allow an extra to do , ’ he reasoned			2
‘ in @entity145 i was playing a rowdy hanging out of a car and i was also in the pool party as a partier , jumping and flipping into the pools , shaking bottles of champagne and throwing people in the water , ’ @entity0 said			1
one of the scariest stunts he 's had to do was being a hit by a motorbike on the show @entity233 as a model , @entity0 was plastered four storeys high on a giant billboard beside @entity20 ’s @entity237 for @entity206 underwear brand ‘ inside the studio was the whole pool and everyone was dressed up			1
’ @entity0 even worked in a scene with @entity214 , who he said is ‘ very professional ’			0
‘ he ’s there to do a job , and he ’s a great actor			0
’ when it comes to being scared , @entity0 said falling down a cliff in @entity185 and being a hit by a motorbike on @entity233 was a ‘ big head game ’			2
‘ how do you get hit by a motorbike ? we strapped a mat to the front of it and practised , ’ @entity0 recalled			2
‘ it ’s all about body placement , ’ when getting hit by a car or motorbike			0
when something is speeding towards him he 's thinking ‘ about his training … it ’s all timing … it ’s a calculated risk ’			0
@entity0 does n’t just spends hours in the gym , his weekly routine will involve a mix of cardio , fight training and gymnastics			2
@entity0 is strict about what he eats and currently follows the @entity271 diet , which avoids carbs			0
' i train less because i eat quite well , ' he explained he said stunt person jobs in @entity48 are n't as common and the parts are getting more and more competitive he spends his time practising stunts in motorbikes and cars , abseiling , diving , perfecting his rope skills , snowboarding , wakeboarding , riding a bmx and skating ‘ you need body control and to be coordinated to control your body in the air during flips			2
‘ then you ’ve got everything else : motorbikes , cars , abseiling , diving , rope skills , snowboarding , wakeboarding , @entity284 and skating , ’ he said			0
‘ anything that an actor ca n’t do or could happen on a job , you need to learn how to do			0
’ @entity0 is also strict about what he eats – and currently follows the @entity271 diet , which avoids carbs			0
‘ i train less because i eat quite well , ’ he explained			0
but for him the discipline is worth it because he gets to be a stuntman			0
‘ it ’s the best job for me , it ’s definitely not for everybody … a lot of people do n’t want to be hit by cars , set on fire or fall of buildings			1
‘ i love it whether there is a lot of work around or if it ’s quite , there ’s nothing else i want to do			0
’ follow @entity0 on @entity321 and @entity322 for more photos			0
there is no other job in the world he would rather be doing but admits ' it ’s definitely not for everybody … a lot of people do n’t want to be hit by cars , set on fire or fall of buildings ' en does n’t just spends hours in the gym , his weekly routine will involve a mix of cardio , fight training and gymnastics			1
