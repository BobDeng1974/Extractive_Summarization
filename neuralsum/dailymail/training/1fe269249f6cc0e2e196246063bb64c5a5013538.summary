by @entity0 a suspected shoplifter was arrested after a new cctv system compared his face with photographs held on @entity6 's database			1
the man had not previously come to the attention of officers but his father and brother were known to police			0
the new computer system compared the suspect 's features with those of criminals already held on the force 's database and flagged the family resemblance			1
the new system compares photographs with images already contained on the police 's database ( file picture ) the new technology is not admissible in courts but it provides officers with a possible lead , allowing them to track down other evidence			1
@entity33 's chief inspector @entity32 revealed that the system managed to identify potential suspects in 44 per cent of cases analysed by the system			1
he said : ' there 's the potential for this to look like @entity39 ... but that 's not the case			0
this is not a surveillance tool , it 's an information and surveillance tool for searching for suspects			0
' the new system may be able to identify thousands of other suspected criminals after it was announced that police in @entity49 will be routinely issued with body - worn cameras following the shooting of @entity52 which led to mass rioting and looting in @entity54			2
the man was arrested after the computer flagged the family resemblance with criminals already photographed already , police have been equipped with cars fitted with an automatic number plate recognition system			1
the cameras photograph a car 's number plate and run it through police databases , alerting officers if a car is not taxed or insured			0
other details such as whether a car is used by a suspected criminal can be included on the system			2
however , @entity71 of @entity72 told @entity73 : ' this takes the intrusiveness of @entity75 to the next level , so it is absolutely essential that people are able to access meaningful redress when they feel their privacy is infringed			0
' many people will see the development of attempting to identify suspects based on the traits of their family members as deeply disturbing			0

officers from @entity33 did not recognise the suspected shoplifter
the new computer compared the image with others held on its database
the system flagged the resemblance allowing officers to make the arrest
human rights *activists* are suspicious of the system *branding* it intrusive
