by @entity0 @entity1 has begun lobbying the state of @entity3 to allow it to test driverless motorbikes and trucks on its roads			1
the technology giant has caused controversy over its driverless vehicle testing in recent years as critics complain of its role in our ever - increasing reliance on technology			1
despite the project still being in its infancy , documents reveal @entity1 now wants to extend its permission to use driverless cars on public roads to other types of vehicles			1
it said : ' it is certainly possible that future testing could include motorcycles or larger commerical vehicles			0
' if some innovator can demonstrate that testing autonomous technology on such vehicles is safe , then they should be allowed to test			0
' in january this year , a group protested outside the home of @entity1 engineer and creator of the driverless @entity26 motorbike @entity24 , over his role in developing autonomous vehicles and @entity1 's links to @entity51 - a military robotics contractor @entity1 acquired last year			2
if driverless motorbikes are designed with any similarity to @entity1 's autonomous cars , the vehicle as we know it will undergo a radical redesign			1
the @entity59 and @entity60 cars @entity1 have refitted for its prototypes have no steering wheels and pedals , with sensors removing blind spots			0
capped at a speed of 40kph , they feature two seats with seat belts , buttons to start and stop and a screen showing the vehicle 's route			0
@entity1 boasts the vehicles ' never get tired or distracted ' and said have clocked up about 1.2million kilometres of driving time on @entity3 roads			2
using imagery of its surroundings processed in real time , the cars are said to anticipate objects and other obstacles as they travel , scanning a distance of two football fields around themselves .			0

documents show @entity1 has *written* to the @entity3 state government to request permission to test motorbikes and trucks on public roads

the company 's driverless car technology *remains* in the prototype stage , but their autonomous *fleet* has travelled more than one million kilometres
