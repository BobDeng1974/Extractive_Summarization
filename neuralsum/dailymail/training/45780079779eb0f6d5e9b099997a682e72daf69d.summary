when filmmaker @entity1 travelled to @entity2 in 2001 to document the struggle between the controversial logging industry and the local community , she never expected that her footage would be used to take her , and 19 others , to court			1
@entity1 was asked to come on board as the in - house filmmaker for advocacy group @entity11 , and continued her own independent filming , capturing the broader environmental issues facing @entity2 at the time			1
faced with backlash from the local community , logging corporation @entity16 sued @entity1 and 19 other activists known as ' the @entity16 20 ' , including lawyers , campaigners , elected politicians , students , doctors , a writer , and a dentist , on charges of conspiracy to undermine their company 's image			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity29 about the documentary , @entity31 5 , which details her involvement in the legal process and the impact it had on her life while the charges were thrown out of court two times before a third and final attempt by woodchipping industry giant @entity16 failed , which contributed to the collapse of their company , @entity1 described the whole experience as intense and quite traumatic			1
having become involved in telling the story of the logging industry 's impact on the state as an individual , she found herself swept up in a much larger issue between @entity16 and the local community			1
in @entity1 's documentary about the experience , she said , ' my life was changing and i had no control over it anymore … i was a player in this massive chess game between this almighty powerful corporation and really , a bunch of community members who ’d been standing up for their backyards			1
' @entity1 spoke to @entity29 about the documentary , @entity31 5 , which details her involvement in the legal process and the impact it had on her life			1
' the whole process of filming and editing was intense			0
it made me relive what had happened , and lots of moments i wondered why i was doing it , there was some awful memories dredged up , ' @entity1 said			2
logging corporation @entity16 sued @entity1 and 19 other activists known as ' the @entity16 20 @entity1 released footage of the company dropping a napalm - like substance on the remainder of a wood - felling site and burning the area ' the uprising was coming from middle class , mainstream communities			1
it was n’t extremists as other people might say , it was a widespread community conflict , ' said @entity1 being both a filmmaker and a defendant , @entity1 was in a unique position to explain the ordeal , and felt that the issues that had plagued @entity2 and the wider @entity94 public remained relevant today			1
' when i went to university i was exposed to documentary film making , and i felt like it was what i wanted to do			2
i became very passionate about telling underdog stories , human rights stories , ones that you do n’t see a lot of in the mainstream media , ' she said			0
' i already had an interest in this and had covered issues in @entity109 and @entity110 and had visited other forest campaigners to learn what they were doing , and in @entity2 in particular i heard about a real uprising			2
' ' it was coming from middle class , mainstream communities			0
it was n’t extremists as other people might say , it was a widespread community conflict			2
' during legal proceedings , @entity1 realised that her documentary footage was one of the ties between the defendants , who were an otherwise disparate group			1
' i never expected for the prosecution to use my footage as evidence to prove a conspiracy			1
i was devastated because i thought i ’d been doing something to help wider community , ' @entity1 said			2
being both a filmmaker and a defendant , @entity1 was in a unique position to explain the ordeal , and felt that the issues that had plagued @entity2 and the wider @entity94 public remained relevant today ' i realised during the legal process that there was no constitutional protection of free speech			1
i thought we had free speech protection , like in the @entity144 , but after doing some more research i discovered that we did n't , which still concerns me , ' she said			0
' there was no legal precedent for a case like this , where @entity16 were re-framing a campaign to raise public awareness as a conspiracy			1
there 's no real protection for whistleblowers , whether that be journalists or filmmakers			0
' @entity1 felt incredibly isolated throughout the trial , and began a series of confessional video diaries as a form of releasing the pent up anguish and anxiety she was feeling			2
' it 's really hard when you 're the one being persecuted because as an individual you do n't have the resources and protection that the corporate giants do , and while you 're being sued you ca n't speak out			0
' ' i was all alone , and it stopped me from doing what i 'd been doing for five years			0
even now my life is still absorbed by the impact of it			0
' @entity1 felt as though she had been gagged , silenced , and without a voice , unable to interact with the world through film as she had for so long			1
it was because of this sense of disempowerment that made the creation of defendant 5 very healing , because even though it was painful at times to make , it gave her back her agency			0
' what people will see when they watch the documentary is a deeply personal story of how it feels to be targeted by a giant corporation and to be denied freedom of speech , ' she said			2
@entity1 released a film showing images of the company dropping a napalm - like substance on the remainder of a wood - felling site and burning the area			1
as major @entity94 banks withdrew support from the company 's industrial plans , @entity16 was unable to source financial backing from overseas after pressure from environmental agencies , and folded as a company			1
the documentary will air next week , coinciding with the ten - year anniversary of the defendant 's receiving the first legal document regarding the case during legal proceedings , @entity1 realised that her documentary footage was what tied all the defendants , who were an otherwise disparate group , together they really shot themselves in the foot with their behaviour , because it was not just an environmental issue , it was now a human rights issue			1
they drew more attention to themselves through their bullish behaviour and ended up in collapse , ' said @entity1			2
@entity1 said that she hopes people will understand that activism is n't the dirty word many think it is , and she wants her film to be part of breaking down misconceptions about what it means to have a sense of social responsibility			1
' we all should have social responsibility , to each other and the world we live in			0
being an activist does n't make you an extremist , it just means you 're someone who cares , ' @entity1 said			0
the documentary will air next week , coinciding with the ten - year anniversary of the defendant 's receiving the first legal document regarding the case			2
' our democratic rights are very tenuous and we ca n't take them for granted			0
if we value having a fair and just @entity94 society then we need to partake and protect our democratic rights , ' she said			0
' 20 people were sued and the other defendants were able to walk away , and i totally understand why , but i ca n't just walk away			0
i need to tell this story			0
' defendant 5 is screening as part of the @entity267 series of documentaries by up and coming @entity94 filmmakers			0
it will air on monday , december 8 at 9.30pm on @entity271 and will then be available to view on @entity272			0
