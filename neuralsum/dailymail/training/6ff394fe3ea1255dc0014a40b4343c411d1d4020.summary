‘ it was unmistakably our drawing room because of the beams , ’ says @entity2 , 63			0
‘ later we saw the camera pan out as @entity9 drove off down our gravel drive and there was a shot of the house itself			2
’ dramatic setting : the timber - clad converted @entity31 , pictured , is set in idyllic 1.6 - acre grounds , which include a pond , in @entity34 , @entity4 this was the moment when the @entity37 discovered that their home had a starring role in a show that had always been one of their favourites			1

the sunday night staple , which ran for eight years from the late 1980s and regularly drew 15 million viewers at its peak , was set in @entity50 , and was mostly filmed around @entity4 and @entity51			0
the picture it painted of @entity55 country life was as much a part of its charm as @entity9 himself sniffing out a valuable heirloom			2

located in the sleepy village of @entity34 , two miles from the medieval town of @entity73 , it is full of interesting features , with red - brick fireplaces , stone floors and beamed doorways			1
‘ we later found out that the television crew virtually camped out in the village pub for two years because so much of the series was filmed in and around here , ’ says @entity2			2
the barn itself dates from 1520 but a previous owner converted it into a home in 1989			1
with a red - brick and weather - boarded facade , it is set in idyllic 1.6 - acre grounds , which include a pond , summerhouse and stables			0
‘ it was converted before building regulations were brought in restricting the number of windows , so it ’s very light and bright , and has great height , which must have been perfect for filming , ’ says @entity1 , 62 , who sold his successful chain of opticians in 1999 and is now a business consultant for firms including @entity100			0
@entity31 was the fictional home of @entity9 's onscreen girlfriend @entity61 , played by @entity62 pictured with star of the show @entity15 , for series five and six which aired between 1993 and 1994 the couple , who have both been married before and have six daughters and nine grandchildren between them , have spent about £ 100,000 on the property			1
