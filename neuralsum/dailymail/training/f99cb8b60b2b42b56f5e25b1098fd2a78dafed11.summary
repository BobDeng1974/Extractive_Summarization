by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 13:29 est , 7 june 2013 he 's famous for his brutal putdowns , the worst of which have been directed at @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 among others			1
and now the best of @entity11 's quotes are to be immortalised in a new book			1
the @entity13 to @entity11 is the brainchild of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , and will feature illustrations by artist @entity19			1
but the star of the show is to be a hand - picked collection of @entity11 's bitchiest bons mots , including lines such as : ' sweatpants are a sign of defeat			1
you lost control of your life so you bought some sweatpants			2
' brutal : @entity32 creative director @entity11 is famous for his catty quips and bitchy comments although the @entity32 designer was n't involved with writing the book , which is due to be released in september , it does allegedly have his seal of approval			1
in recent years , @entity11 has become almost as famous for his quips as he has for his design prowess , having taken a swipe at everyone from the entire nation of @entity44 to , yes , the younger @entity46 sister			1
in the days following the royal wedding in 2011 , the designer gave an interview to a @entity50 magazine , during the course of which he revealed his dislike of @entity53			1
he said : ' @entity54 has a nice silhouette and she is the right girl for that boy			2
i like that kind of woman , i like romantic beauties			0
' on the other hand , her sister struggles			0
i do n't like the sister 's face			1
she should only show her back			0
' he followed that rattle of invective with a critique of the fashion on show during the celebrations , saying : ' this was not a collection , this was the choices of this kind of woman for this kind of ceremony : the bad proportions , the ugly hats , the short skirts on fat legs			0
' fat is a favourite topic of @entity11 's , who caused outrage a year later when he took a pop at @entity90 singer , @entity7 , describing her as ' a little too fat ' , although he drew the sting slightly by calling her beautiful and adding that her voice is ' divine '			1
not content with upsetting @entity7 and the @entity94 , he then went on to ask whether any part of singer @entity96 was real , before surpassing himself by offending the whole of @entity98			1
' if i was a woman in @entity98 i would be a lesbian , as the men are very ugly , ' he quipped			1
' there are a few handsome ones , like @entity104 's boyfriend , but there you see the most beautiful women and the most horrible men			1
' the victims : both @entity6 and @entity5 have been on the receiving end of a @entity11 quip another country to feel the sting of @entity11 's tongue was @entity44 , after the designer weighed into the debate on the nation 's financial crisis and corruption problems			1
' @entity44 needs to work on a cleaner image , ' he advised			1
' it 's a big problem , as they have this reputation of being so corrupt			1
' you ca n't be sure the money will go where it 's supposed to go			2
nobody wants @entity44 to disappear , but they have really disgusting habits			1
' he 's even had a crack at the press , most recently at @entity134 , whose editor , @entity135 , ran a story that claimed @entity11 was overrated			1
' first of all , @entity135 's magazine is not doing well at all , ' he riposted			2
i 'm sorry for @entity135 , who was such a success at @entity140 , to go down with a s * * * ty little paper like this			0
' collection : the new book , which is out in september , includes 50 of @entity11 's best and bitchiest quotes on short , unattractive people : ' life is not a beauty contest , some [ ugly people ] are great			1
what i hate is nasty , ugly people ... the worst is ugly , short men			2
women can be short , but for men it is impossible			0
it is something that they will not forgive in life ... they are mean and they want to kill you			0
' on people who complain about thin models : ' they are fat mummies sitting with their bags of crisps in front of the television , saying that thin models are ugly			1
' on former friend and @entity32 muse , @entity172 : ' i wish her all the luck in the world , just so long as i do n't have to see her anymore or hear her spoken about			0
' on pop star , seal : ' i am no dermatologist but i would n't want his skin			2
mine looks better than his			0
he is covered in craters			0
' on @entity183 : ' i do n't know @entity183			0
she was never known in @entity184			0
@entity185 also does n't know who she is			0
' on fur : ' it is farmers who are nice to the cows and the pigs and then kill them			0
it 's even more hypocritical than hunters			2
at least the hunters do n't flatter the animals ...			0
i do n't like that people butcher animals , but i do n't like them to butcher humans either , which is apparently very popular in the world			2
' on the @entity203 : ' she looks a little bit like her grandmother - a more smiley version			0
" in terms of what she wears , she 's come into herself a little bit more - whatever that is			2
' on @entity6 : ' i do n't understand the change of hair			0
i adore madame @entity6 , i love her			0
but there is a news reader at @entity216 which has this haircut ... frankly , this does n't suit her			0
the fringe was a bad idea , it 's not good			2
' on @entity7 : ' the thing at the moment is @entity7			1
she is a little too fat , but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice			0
' on @entity96 : ' is she a construct with all her implants ? '			0

@entity5 and @entity7 have both been on the receiving end of @entity11 's wit
he has also managed to offend the entire population of @entity44 and @entity98
the designer once took a pop at people who object to skinny models
