@entity28 , who is from @entity37 , has been with @entity30 since he was eight years old and was spotted playing in a tournament at @entity39			2
@entity40 : @entity28 of @entity30 ( left ) could have a big move on his hands he turns 17 in january and has shown versatility playing at left - back as well as centre - back			1
@entity26 are continuing to scour @entity32 for upcoming talent as they did with @entity49 protégé @entity48			0
the @entity51 - born youngster failed to settle though and has since returned to @entity32 with @entity52			0
@entity24 manager @entity53 admitted he enjoyed the sausages on his recent scouting trip to @entity56 , however , the trip home was n’t so successful			0
@entity53 was at @entity59 against @entity60 to watch @entity62 striker @entity61 play for the visitors			1
the 21 - year - old struggled to impress against a dominant @entity59 and the day got worse for @entity53 on his way back to the airport when his hire car broke down and he had to get out to help his driver push the car to the side of the road			0
fortunately for ‘ @entity53 ’ an @entity73 scout , who had also been to the game , was passing and stopped to give him a lift to the airport			0
watchful eye : @entity61 ( left ) has been looked at by both @entity24 and @entity73 @entity53 gave little away saying : ‘ i was at @entity60 versus @entity59			1
the sausages were great ! they ot beat quite comfortably so in terms of that player you would n’t be able to judge him on that particular game because they got battered			0
’ @entity61 has scored 16 goals this season and is understood to have a release clause of £ 5million should his side , who sit second from bottom , be relegated			0

@entity99 are willing to sell for £ 2.5million and @entity102 have also expressed an interest			2
potential : @entity30 and @entity73 have expressed interest in @entity96 loan star @entity94 @entity94 has caught the eye with his performances this season and his ability to play in a number of positions across the midfield			1
his goal contribution has also helped , notably his individual effort against @entity114 at @entity115 early in the season			0
@entity30 , meanwhile , are also among clubs monitoring @entity118 striker @entity117 with @entity119 expected to return to @entity120 in the summer			2

he has been a star turn for @entity133 and has scored 19 goals in 32 games			2
apart from @entity121 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 are all keen on @entity140 - born @entity139 who will be out of contract in the summer			0
north of the border : @entity121 could move for @entity133 's @entity123 @entity140 suitors for @entity144 are expected to be disappointed this summer			1
the @entity146 international centre forward has been courted by @entity24 , @entity147 and @entity73 in recent seasons and @entity99 are ready to sell with just one year remaining on his contract			1
however , the 28 - year - old ’s wages of around £ 75,000 a week mean he is heading to @entity153 with @entity154 and @entity155 both interested			0
