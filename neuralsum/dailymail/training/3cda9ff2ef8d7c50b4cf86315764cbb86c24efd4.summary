by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 has been unveiled as the new @entity5 captain			1
the 28 - year - old @entity7 skipper succeeds @entity8 after the @entity10 star retired from international duty following @entity5 's disappointing @entity13 campaign in @entity14			1
@entity15 , @entity5 's vice-captain at last summer 's @entity13 where the @entity5 failed to win a game , also announced his retirement earlier this week			1
' @entity3 is an obvious choice for his honesty , commitment to the cause , his experience , the fact he has already captained @entity5 in the past , ' @entity22 said			1
' now of course he 's got that responsibility at @entity7 as well			2
all those factors weighed into my thought process and i 'm pleased to be able to say i 've been able to offer it to him			0
i had a long conversation with him and he 's prepared to accept the pressures the @entity5 captaincy brings			1
' asked if he expected the move to spur @entity3 on to even greater heights , however , @entity22 demurred			1
' i try to shy away from that , ' he said			0
' i think it 's dangerous to demand that of people			2
we see so often in the past it takes you on to a new level but with 95 caps and all the goals he 's scored , all the things he 's done , we 've already seen he 's prepared to take responsibility			2
' we hope he continues to push on , he continues to play well and he shoulders the responsibility of the captaincy as well as the other captains before him			2
' @entity3 told thefa.com : ' to be named as @entity5 captain is a dream come true for me personally and of course my family , ' it is something that i will take massive pride in doing			1
' as a kid i always loved watching a big @entity5 game on the television			0
back then i had a burning ambition to play for my country			0
to be appointed captain is beyond my wildest dreams			0
' i would obviously like to thank @entity18 and the coaching staff for having the belief and confidence in me to do the job			0
' passing it on : @entity22 was left in no doubt that @entity3 was the right man to lead the new @entity5 @entity3 was backed for the job by predecessor @entity8 , and will consult his fellow @entity88 before getting stuck into his new task			1
' i intend to speak with @entity8 about different aspects of the role , ' @entity3 said			1
' we had a great relationship from the moment we played together for our country and right up to our final game in @entity14			0
i am sure if ever i need to seek his advice he will be there to help			0
' @entity3 has had disciplinary problems in the past , but @entity22 said he had not concerned himself with those issues			1
' i 've got to judge him on the two years i 've been with him , ' @entity22 said			0
' it 's not for me to look back too much into the past and whatever misdemeanours the player may have had			2
' in the two years with me i 've had no reason whatsoever to question anything about his character or desire to play for his country or his wholehearted willingness to offer himself in every situation			0
' i 'm not concerned about anything else but he has that baggage with him and he will have to accept that as an added part of the pressure			0
you ca n't draw a line under the past			0
