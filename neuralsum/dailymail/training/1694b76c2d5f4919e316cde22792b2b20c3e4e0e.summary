@entity0 roared his approval , offered a little glare but resisted the urge to have words with @entity5 and then soaked up the adulation of his home crowd			0
it was the big moment of a huge bowling display from @entity10			0
the man @entity11 tried to get banned from this fourth test had just trapped his nemesis lbw after a superb demonstration of swing bowling and @entity16 were on the ropes at 63 for six after winning the toss and batting			2
they may have made something of a recovery to reach 152 all out and just about stayed in the game by dismissing @entity24 just before the close to leave @entity10 on 113 for three			2
but this was very much the home side ’s day			0
in form : @entity28 salutes the crowd after taking six wickets during day on the fourth test in @entity32 great day at the office : @entity28 celebrates with team - mates after taking his sixth wicket , that of @entity36 @entity38 ja vu : the @entity10 bowler finished the day on remarkable figures having taken six wickets for 25 runs no one more than @entity0 , who was this week cleared of all charges over his @entity45 spat with @entity5 , even if he was ultimately overshadowed by strike partner @entity28 as @entity10 ran riot under cloudy @entity32 skies			1
both @entity11 and @entity48 would have batted first on an @entity50 pitch with pace and carry but it turned into an excellent toss to lose because of the excellence of one of the most prolific partnerships in @entity58 history			1
it was @entity0 and @entity28 who squandered perfect bowling conditions on the first morning at @entity62 ’s where @entity10 went on to crash to a second @entity58 defeat			1
yet since then the senior pair have displayed class and character to hit back at the @entity68 and then gloriously on thursday when , particularly in the first hour , they bowled with a pace , hostility and skill that was almost unplayable			0
the sun - baked summer has not exactly made @entity10 feel at home but the arrival of this series in @entity32 was always likely to bring the weather they have craved			2
brave stand : @entity16 captain @entity11 hit a defiant 71 as his team crumbled in their first innings looking up : @entity82 sends a ball high towards the boundary at @entity50 it was perfect weather for ducks on thursday — a @entity58 record six in one innings , in fact			1
half a dozen @entity92 batsmen failed to trouble the scorers against @entity95 in 1980 , while six @entity96 ( v @entity16 in 1996 ) and six @entity97 ( v @entity95 in 2002 ) suffered the same fate			0
the record for a test is 11 — most recently set by @entity10 and @entity101 at @entity102 in july			0
@entity103 waddles off after nicking @entity0 to @entity48			2
@entity28 gets the plaudits after having @entity106 caught at slip			0
@entity0 is jubilant after trapping @entity5 in front			0
@entity109 is castled after leaving a @entity28 delivery that nipped back			0
@entity28 wraps things up by bowling @entity36			0
the stage may have been set but @entity0 and @entity28 had to make the most of it , as they did in reducing @entity16 to a scarcely believable eight for four , all four wickets falling in 13 balls on the same score			1
@entity0 ’s third over was a double wicket maiden as @entity103 and then @entity104 , again failing to live up to his lofty reputation , both fell without scoring with @entity10 ’s slip fielding matching the brilliance of their bowling			1
@entity126 , thrown in here at the expense of @entity129 , and @entity106 were the other early victims , both falling to @entity28 , as @entity16 ’s lowest score against @entity10 , 42 in 1974 at @entity133 , looked under threat			1
that they did not plumb those depths was almost totally down to their captain , @entity11 displaying considerable guts to overcome the limitations of his technique against the moving ball and the numerous blows to his body			0
@entity11 had seen @entity16 ’s best batsman in this series , @entity145 , fall to @entity148 before the moment that @entity0 will cherish more than most of his 374 test victims			1
appeal : @entity11 runs between the wickets as @entity10 's @entity0 turns to the umpire in @entity32 flying high : @entity148 jumps for joy after taking the wicket of @entity145 at @entity50 he may have been exonerated by judge @entity156 and the decision of @entity159 chief executive @entity158 not to contest the not guilty verdict but @entity0 ’s aggressive approach was still under the microscope here			1
@entity48 had told him to carry on cursing but @entity0 was noticeably quieter , even after trapping @entity5 with the perfect inswinger to the left - hander after setting him up with three outswingers			2
exceptional , highly skilled bowling			0
that left @entity0 just nine wickets behind sir @entity169 ’s @entity58 wicket - taking record but he was unable to add to it because of @entity11 ’s defiance and the fact that @entity28 then blew @entity16 away			1
@entity28 needs an operation on his right knee but he did not look hindered here as he recorded four wicket maidens and ended up with six for 25 , his third - best test haul			0
by the time @entity11 became the fifth of his six victims , @entity16 ’s captain had scored 71 , with only @entity82 offering much support with a hard - hitting 40 on his return to the side			2
@entity16 might have failed to reach three figures had @entity148 and @entity186 been able to offer more penetrative support but they are making their way in test cricket and it was understandable that @entity10 were unchanged			0
@entity16 were just about able to hang on in there , with @entity193 failing to convince before losing his off stump to @entity109 and @entity48 giving it away with a poor pull shot against the lively newcomer @entity197			1
@entity24 and @entity198 were taking the @entity199 away from @entity16 until @entity197 struck in the last over — eight of the day ’s allocation were lost because of woeful over-rates — to gain an lbw shout from @entity205 who , along with @entity206 , had an excellent day			1
not nearly as good , though , as that of @entity28 and @entity0 who have given @entity10 the perfect chance to dictate terms in this decisive test			2
@entity10 's turn : captain @entity48 takes to the field for his first innings during the fourth test @entity216 of hope : @entity16 bowler @entity109 high - fives a team - mate after bowling @entity193 impressive start : @entity10 batsman @entity24 cuts a ball to the boundary during day one of the fourth test good innings : @entity198 , pictured , finished the day strongly for @entity10 in @entity32 , scoring 45 runs			1

@entity10 bowler took six wickets for just 25 runs during @entity16 's first innings
@entity16 captain @entity11 put up a brave *individual* stand , scoring 71 runs
the *visitors* were all out for 152 at @entity50 , *due* to the impressive bowling of @entity28 and @entity0
@entity48 and @entity193 's wickets fell early on but @entity24 and @entity198 struck up a decent partnership as @entity10 chased the 152 run total
but @entity24 was bowled by @entity197 in closing minutes at @entity50
@entity10 trail by *39* runs going into the second day in @entity32
