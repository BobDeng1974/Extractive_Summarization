will @entity0 lead @entity1 into the @entity3 next season ? will @entity0 lead @entity1 into the @entity3 next season ? now share your opinion @entity6 is a happy man			1
after the perceived debacle of @entity8 and enduring months of boorish antics under @entity10 , @entity11 believe they finally have their man			2
judging by the chairman ’s comments on monday , @entity0 is the one to claw back @entity3 riches			1
that ’s the mantra as he settles in at @entity18 following resignation at @entity20 and subsequent appointment in north @entity22			1
but , more to the point , @entity6 indicated that the @entity24 will install that flowing , attractive football those around @entity18 are so fond of ; the @entity27			1
new man at the helm : @entity0 was appointed as @entity11 manager on monday and he 's gone : @entity10 was unceremoniously dumped by @entity1 at the end of the last season ‘ in @entity0 i believe we have a head coach who , with his high energy , attacking football , will embrace the style of play we associate with our club , ' @entity6 enthused			1
' he has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual , whilst building great team spirit and a winning mentality			0
' we have a talented squad that @entity0 is excited to be coaching next season			1
' it ’s a populist view			0
a @entity1 blogger was cheerleading in the hours after the announcement that supporters ’ enthusiasm centres on the ‘ swashbuckling ’ @entity20 side of last season			1
that appears to be a general consensus			0
let ’s not forget , however , that this is the same @entity20 side which found the net 54 times in the @entity61 last season – the exact same as @entity62			2
every team above them scored more			0
@entity0 does n’t implore his side to pour forward ; they keep the ball – pass , probe and weave their way to goal patiently and in a measured fashion			2
it served them exceptionally well and @entity20 were one of the more attractive sides to watch			2
happy man : @entity1 chairman @entity6 believes @entity0 will bring back attacking football that was n't the problem ! @entity81 and @entity82 were excellent going forward last year however , if @entity11 fans – and , more importantly , the hierarchy – believe they ’re in for a feast of goals they are likely to be disappointed			1
swashbuckling @entity10 would be a more appropriate fit if success was measured by the goals - for column			0
during his time at the club @entity1 scored more times than @entity95 with strikers largely derided for their impotency			0
@entity20 did n’t actually see a marked difference in goalmouth action when @entity0 rocked up at @entity100 ’s			1
while in charge in the top flight , @entity101 saw his side score 1.35 times a game			0
@entity0 ’s record was 1.36			2
they created fewer chances than @entity109 during the last campaign and , interestingly , boasted a poorer record than @entity62 away			1
the 42 - year - old is a sound choice given his record , but seemingly for the wrong reasons			1
in many ways , he is an extension of the meticulous @entity8			2
@entity20 ’s defensive record was excellent under him , managing to keep clean sheets in 35 per cent of their games			1
just what was required , given shipping goals was one of the deciding factors in @entity126 rightly getting the boot in january 2013			0
major blow : @entity20 could now lose the likes of @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 cautious ? @entity20 actually created fewer chances per game than @entity109 under @entity0 rock steady ! @entity135 ( left ) and the rest of the @entity20 back four were superb throughout their campaign it ’s no bad thing that @entity0 is more cautious - a bit of solidity is exactly what @entity1 require			1
there is a much smaller chance of his @entity1 side conceding three against @entity146 in front of their own supporters , as well as five against @entity149 and @entity150			0
away from home they should n't be allowing @entity62 , @entity149 or @entity153 to notch four or more			0
the facts tell their own story			0
saints conceded 46 times last year , less than @entity158 ’ @entity157			2
as a direct comparison , @entity1 saw the ball in their net on 51 occasions – more than @entity163			0
he needs to land players who are going to make a difference in a defensive sense , particularly at centre half			0
going off @entity6 ’s past dealings with his employees , cash to fund that wo n’t be a problem			2
for any new manager at a club to have struggled , the way forward is by starting from the back and patience from above - not an attribute @entity1 are renowned for			0
a five - year deal suggests , on the surface at least , that @entity0 will be afforded time			1
boy , does he need it .			0

@entity0 resigned at @entity20 and given five - year deal on monday
@entity6 and supporters are excited about his style of play
saints created fewer chances than @entity109 last season
the @entity24 is similar to @entity8 and will build a back four
his defensive record was excellent while at @entity100 's
@entity0 should prove an excellent choice at @entity18
