there have been many dna tests , on saliva traces on the letter stamp and , later , tests on @entity8 's clothes have been inconclusive			2
@entity134 , @entity53 - @entity53 's cousin , was the main suspect , after his 15 - year - old sister - in - law told police there was circumstantial proof he had murdered @entity22			0
