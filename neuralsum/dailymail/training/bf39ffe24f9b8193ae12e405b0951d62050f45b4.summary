by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:45 est , 14 january 2014 updated : 10:05 est , 14 january 2014 reverting back : @entity3 , a @entity4 state senator in @entity5 , said that if the chemicals used in lethal injections are not available , the state should use firing squads a @entity5 lawmaker is pushing to allow use of the firing squad to execute condemned state inmates if there are ever any issues that prevent the state from securing lethal injections			1
@entity4 state senator @entity3 said monday that state law currently calls for using a gas chamber if lethal injection is unavailable			1
' the state of @entity5 does n't have a gas chamber currently , an operating gas chamber , so the procedure and expense to build one would be impractical to me , ' said @entity3 , a member of the @entity26			1
' i consider frankly the gas chamber to be cruel and unusual , so i went with firing squad because they also have it in @entity30			1
' he 's introduced the bill for consideration in the legislative session that starts february 10 in @entity35			0
' one of the reasons i chose firing squad as opposed to any other form of execution is because frankly it 's one of the cheapest for the state , ' @entity3 said			1
' the expense of building a gas chamber i think would be prohibitive when you consider how many people would be executed by it , and even the cost of gallows			2
' @entity3 said his bill addressed the possibility that the state could have to find a substitute for using lethal injection because a number of states are running short of the chemicals used for lethal injection			2
modern day firing squad : this is the execution chamber at @entity61 where a firing squad lines up and kills the seated prisoner what remains : four of the bullet holes from the killing of @entity67 on june 18 , 2010 are seen in the wood in @entity71 , for example , the state auditor is undertaking a probe of the @entity73 over its use of a new death penalty drug			2
that state for years had used a three - drug blend to perform executions until pharmaceutical companies stopped selling those drugs to prisons			0
@entity71 has executed two inmates in recent months using the sedative pentobarbital and plans a third execution later this month			0
the drug comes from a compounding pharmacy in @entity87 not licensed to do business in @entity71			0
in line : @entity5 's only inmate currently on death row is @entity92 , 68 , who is challenging the constitutionality of the death sentence he received in 2004 for the rape and murder of 18 - year - old @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity101 the pace of inmate executions is much slower in @entity5 , which has only one inmate on death row and last executed an inmate in 1992			2
inmate @entity92 , 68 , is challenging the constitutionality of the death sentence he received in 2004 for the rape and murder of 18 - year - old @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity101			0
the @entity111 already has upheld @entity113 's conviction , but a federal court has put the execution on hold for the past several years while it considers his appeal			0
@entity118 , executive director of the @entity119 in @entity120 , said monday he believes @entity5 could face constitutional challenges if it tried to use the firing squad as its only method of execution			2
@entity118 said @entity30 has offered inmates the choice of being executed by firing squad but said the state is phasing out the punishment			1
he said mandating the use of the firing squad if lethal injection were unavailable , as @entity3 seeks to do , would be a different matter			1
' that i think would raise concerns in the federal courts , perhaps the state courts , about whether and unusual , perhaps a cruel and unusual punishment is being inflicted , ' @entity118 said			0
' i do n't know how the ultimate ruling would come down , but i think there would be delays as that case got considered and it might even go up to the @entity111			0
this is not what @entity30 has done			0
' running into problems : a number of states have had problems securing the chemicals used in lethal injections so @entity3 said that he thought firing squads - like those used in @entity30 - were the next most humane option			1

@entity4 state senator @entity3 believes that gas chambers are less humane than firing squads and would cost too much to build
comes as many states are having problems getting the rare chemicals *needed* to perform lethal injections
@entity30 has an operating firing squad room used to kill death row inmates
