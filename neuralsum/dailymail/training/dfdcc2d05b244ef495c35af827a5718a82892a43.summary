@entity1 's @entity0 picked @entity2 as one of his 10 players to watch at the beginning of the season , writing : ' watch him wrestling with defenders , pulling and scratching and diving to win penalties			1
@entity10 will love him , defenders will hate him ! he is a finisher - and i fancy him to settle quickly and score plenty			2
' after watching @entity2 closely at @entity14 last season , i picked him as one of my 10 to watch this time around			1
so far , so good			2
the @entity17 is an absolute animal and has made a sensational start to his @entity21 career			1
he charges around like the @entity22 and the @entity24 defence looked petrified of him at @entity26			2
every game he looks like scoring			2
that ’s because he is so hungry and you do n’t always see that same drive in every striker			0
@entity33 accused some of the @entity24 players of picking on @entity2 , but he does n’t look like the kind of person you can bully ! he can be wound up but his spat with @entity40 did n’t bother me in the slightest			1
he ’s a winner and can be a revelation in this league			1
if he had , the game and the headlines would all be about him			0
instead it was another team display that showed the gulf in class between @entity54 and @entity53			1
@entity50 bought into the work ethic and @entity67 will hope he keeps it up			1
as for his team - mate , @entity69 is now @entity71 ’s best player			0
he is lightning fast , beats defenders for fun and has all the ability to become our talisman			0
what a start to the season for @entity79 and @entity80			1
the winger has three goals in three games and @entity80 are joint top of the league with nine out of nine points			2
@entity87 is doing a fine job , bringing in good players like @entity90 but also clearing out others like @entity92 , who i always felt was a bit of a @entity96 defender — something of a liability			0
a lot of people tipped @entity80 to go down this season			2
on this form ? not a chance			0
all smiles : @entity105 is mobbed by his @entity107 team - mates as they beat @entity108 after getting sacked by @entity110 in 2009 , saturday ’s win will have felt very good for @entity112 boss @entity111			1
he and his players will have watched @entity110 tear apart @entity53 last week and probably thought to themselves : ‘ my god , this could be a nightmare for us			1
’ a lot of teams will go to the @entity119 with damage limitation in mind , but not @entity112			0
they arrived with a game plan and were well organised			0
@entity110 only lost once at home last season — to @entity21 in february — so full credit to @entity112			1
you will have to go a long way to find a better result in the league this season			2
no matter how much he cost , @entity56 was never going to arrive at @entity132 , wave a magic wand and turn them into the @entity135 of old			1
he showed glimpses of quality at @entity59 but the team are playing with fear , probably for the first time in their lives			0
@entity142 will hate not being able to work with several players over the international break , because there is a lot to be done			0
but after planes over the stadium and being made a scapegoat last season , @entity147 must be relieved to know it was not just down to him			2
too much too soon ? youngster @entity152 struggles when he leads the line for @entity155 only a few days ago @entity156 said @entity152 could be the man to lead the line for @entity155 in their title challenge this season			1
no goals in 16 games shows he is not the answer			0
@entity155 have a team of playmakers but imagine if they had a world - class striker to finish off those chances ? even with @entity167 fit they lack firepower			1
@entity156 now says he will be active in the transfer market to solve the problem , but to leave it this late is ridiculous			0
after his year at @entity135 did not go to plan , @entity174 has , to an extent , come home to @entity177			1
the key for him is having a boss who believes in him			0
the fans already love him at @entity177 and will even more after his late equaliser at @entity184			1
he has talent and this is a good chance for him to remind us all what he ’s capable of			0
five years ago @entity188 was playing for @entity189			0
now he ’s scoring goals in the @entity191			0
as a player you always have some doubts and missing that penalty on the opening day wo n’t have helped , but there ’s no doubt he can cut it			2
i saw him the evening after the game and congratulated him , but when i asked my dad if i should buy him a bottle of champagne , it was a definite no ! that ’s the dedication needed at the top level these days			0
storming run : @entity209 travelled 70 yards to score @entity112 's winner against @entity110 @entity54 v @entity53 is now the joint highest scoring @entity191 fixture in history , with @entity53 v @entity184			1
both fixtures have had a total of 129 goals			0
i had an element of sympathy for @entity105 this summer			1
he wanted out but had to watch as his friends were all sold off around him			0
but results like saturday ’s will make it much easier for him to stay a little while longer at @entity107			1
players have been known to go on strike to force a move but it looks like the @entity226 is happy to knuckle down			2
he is a box - to - box midfielder who can do it all and , with @entity230 giving him licence to play further forward , he ’s adding goals to his game , too			0
but if he does keep his shooting boots on , he needs to remember to celebrate a bit more			0
his body language was slightly odd at @entity108 — goals do n’t come along that often from midfield so you have to enjoy them ! where 's this come from ? @entity80 's @entity79 already has three @entity191 goals this season stories : @entity174 celebrates scoring an equaliser on his second debut for @entity177 at @entity184			1

@entity2 has been a revelation at @entity21 since his summer move
@entity50 should have scored on his @entity53 debut
@entity174 is back at @entity177 where the winger 's loved
@entity105 was linked with a move away from @entity107
@entity56 wo n't turn @entity135 around *overnight*
@entity152 is n't the man to lead the @entity155 line this season
