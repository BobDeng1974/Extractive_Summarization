the 39 - year - old sergeant must serve at least ten years in prison after being found guilty last month of executing the severely wounded @entity27 prisoner in @entity28 in september 2011			1
but the severity of the punishment has sparked a massive wave of support for the first @entity34 serviceman to be convicted of murder on active service abroad since the @entity37			2
many believe @entity1 should have received a more lenient sentence reflecting how the intense stress of fighting on the front line led to a ‘ moment of madness ’			1

@entity0 , pictured on the day he shot the insurgent , was jailed for 10 years but 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the sentence to be reduced however , defence secretary @entity75 said it would be ‘ wrong ’ to comment on the clamour for a reduced sentence			1
he said : ‘ this is an independent judicial decision			0
the court will have had all the facts , including pleas in mitigation around the sentencing decision			0
there may well be an appeal over the sentence			2
’ meanwhile , a survey found that six out of ten people thought the commando ’s prison sentence should be halved to five years			1
