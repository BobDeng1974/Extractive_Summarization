several major fashion retailers have been busted for marketing their items as ' faux fur ' when in fact they are crafted from real animal pelts			1
in an investigation led by @entity11 's @entity10 , stores including @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were found to be selling mislabeled jackets , sweaters and boots from brands including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
tests performed at the @entity21 in @entity22 proved that all four of the ' faux fur ' items purchased and examined under the microscope contained real fur from coyotes , rabbits and raccoon dogs			1
busted : this @entity19 sweater ( left ) was advertised by @entity7 as being ' faux fur - trimmed ' but is in fact rabbit fur , and this @entity16 coat ( right ) was described by @entity8 as being ' faux ' but is actually coyote fur all the brands concerned issued statements in which they apologized for their actions and unanimously declared these hiccups were clerical errors rather than deliberate deceptions			1
@entity7 pointed out that the @entity19 ' faux fur - trimmed sweater ' it sold had the correct ' real fur ' label sewn in , but a website copywriter had wrongly described it as ' faux ' on its site			1
@entity7 referred to the ' inaccurate description ' of its @entity18 faux fur - trimmed jacket as ' a result of human error by a @entity7 staffer			2
' the fur was in fact from a raccoon dog			0
@entity18 added that it would no longer be selling real fur after its @entity60 collection			2
@entity6 blamed its vendor @entity61 for mislabeling a pair of ' faux fur - trimmed boots			2
' @entity65 confirmed that ' a small quantity of rabbit fur boots were mislabeled ' as a result of an ' inadvertent error			0
' @entity8 admitted it had sold six @entity16 coats which were labelled as ' faux ' but were in fact made from real fur , again due to a ' clerical error			1
' caught red - handed : @entity6 blamed its vendor @entity61 for mislabeling a pair of ' faux fur ' boots ( pictured ) for which @entity65 apologized , citing an ' inadvertent error ' @entity79 , who runs the @entity81 ' fur - free campaign , is n't convinced			1
' some of the good faux furs can be more expensive to use when making jackets or other garments than low - quality animal fur , ' he explains			2
' they may use animal fur just because it 's cheaper			0
' he added : ' it 's outrageous			0
we 're talking products made from animals who probably suffered , and certainly died , for a product that is not even what the customer wanted			0
' @entity98 animal advocacy nonprofit @entity97 , states that more than 50 million animals are violently killed for use in fashion every year			0
according to the @entity103 of @entity98 however , the fur industry is entirely justifiable due to it being a ' historically significant ' trade and ' a highly desirable consumer product			0
' proven : tests performed at the @entity21 in @entity22 ( pictured ) proved that all five of the ' faux fur ' items purchased and examined under the microscope contained real fur @entity98 fur sales for 2013 were $ 1.39 billion – a ten per cent increase over the previous year			1
still , according to a may 2014 @entity116 poll , nearly 100 million @entity98 said they considered buying and wearing real fur to be ' morally wrong			0
' @entity11 's latest expose is just the latest in a string of similar ' mislabeling ' incidents regarding the sale of faux fur			1
in september , @entity122 's was found to be selling coats labelled as ' faux fur ' but actually made from raccoon dog pelts			2
the retailer predictably apologized , blamed its vendor and stopped selling the coats			0
ours to wear ? @entity18 's ' faux fur ' coat was found to be made from raccoon dog fur ( left ) , while a mislabeled @entity16 coat was made from coyote pelt ( center ) and @entity65 used rabbit ( right ) and last year , the @entity137 charged @entity6 with the same offense , after which @entity6 settled and promised not to do so again			1
in a statement to @entity141 , @entity139 said : ' companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are not misleading customers who do n’t want to support animals being bludgeoned , electrocuted , or skinned alive for their fur			0
' @entity139 ’s advice is that if there ’s any doubt about whether a fur is really faux , it ’s best just to avoid it altogether			0

four ' faux fur ' labelled items were purchased from various *online* stores by @entity11 's @entity156 and then examined in a laboratory
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were found to be ' mislabeling ' items by @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity161
all the brands apologized and cited ' clerical ' and ' human ' errors for the *blunders*
@entity79 of the @entity167 claims that using real fur is often cheaper to produce than ' good faux fur '
