takeaway curries might be tempting , but they may not contains the perfect ratio of ingredients			0
a physicist has revealed a complicated formula for the most satisfying curry by examining the key ingredients in all types of the popular dish			2
dr @entity9 said the ideal curry must pass the ' fork test ' so that every forkful and mouthful contains all the key ingredients in equal measure			1
dr @entity9 said that based on a 27cm plate size , the perfect meal requires a 23cm diameter bed of rice just 5mm thick , which supports a low dome of curry that is 14cm in diameter and is 2.4cm high at the tallest point dr @entity9 , from the @entity25 at the @entity26 said every forkful of curry should include meat or vegetable , sauce and rice in a ratio of 1:1:1			1
the golden ratio , which dates back to @entity35 , is said to be the most aesthetically pleasing , while satisfying taste and texture when it comes to certain foods			1
according to dr @entity9 , for the formula to work , the circle of rice bedded on the plate needs to be 61 per cent wider than the spherical cap of curry sat on top			1
that way the formula , which was commissioned by @entity41 , can be applied to any size meal			0
for example , using a 27cm plate size , the perfect meal requires a 23cm diameter bed of rice just 5mm thick			0
this supports a low dome of curry which is 14cm in diameter and is 2.4cm high at the tallest point			0
dr @entity9 said , with a recommended portion size of 100g of cooked rice per person , the perfect meal requires 200g of curry to balance it visually			1
the plate should also contain 100g of meat or vegetables statistics from @entity67 dr @entity9 , who spent 40 hours devising the formula , said : ' we assume that , with a 27cm standard dinner plate , we want a 2cm clear band of clean plate around the outside of the rice			1
' this is for aesthetic purposes and to allow room on the plate for " breakage " of the circle of rice when eating			2
' with a recommended portion size of 100g of cooked rice per person , or 60g uncooked , the perfect meal requires 200g of curry to balance it visually			1
the plate should also contain 100g of meat or vegetables			2
' the fluffiness of the rice is key to the formula as , with the separate grains , there is as much air as rice when laid out on the plate , ' dr @entity9 said			1
' this affects the look of the rice and how it feels in the mouth			0
this changes the effective density of the rice and results in equal volumes of rice and curry having different weights , ' he added			0
@entity109 is one of @entity111 â€™s most popular dishes and the nation eats an estimated 3.5 million curries a week , with and one in seven being tikka masalas			0
@entity116 , senior brand manager at @entity41 , said : ' the perfect curry really is about balancing each of the elements to ensure the best culinary experience possible			0
' it is also important that the meal is visually appealing too , so the " hill " of curry sits perfectly on the wider base of rice			2

a @entity26 physicist said a forkful of curry should *conform* to the golden ratio for satisfying taste and texture
the *research* found the circle of rice bedded on the plate needs to be 61 per cent wider than the spherical cap of curry sat on top
dr @entity9 said recommended portion should include 100g of cooked rice , 200g of curry to balance it visually and 100g of meat or vegetables
