' delaying the release of the audio recordings , particularly where the legal justification to keep them confidential is lacking , only serves to fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials			1
' calls that were made from cellphones and routed to state police dispatchers are not among the tapes			2
those include calls from a woman who was injured in the foot and a parent who called from inside a conference room during the shooting , according to documents released last week by prosecutors .			2
