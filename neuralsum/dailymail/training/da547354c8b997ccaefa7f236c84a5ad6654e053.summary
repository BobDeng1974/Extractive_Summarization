whether he 's rocking a man bun or crucifix earrings , there 's no denying that @entity4 is the trendiest resident of @entity5			1
so iconic has the made in @entity8 star 's look become that he channelled his style expertise into a clothing line , @entity11			1
the 25 - year - old has unveiled his aw14 range and modelled it in an exclusive photoshoot for @entity15			0
i feel that the brand has gone from strength to strength over the last three years , and this collection is a reflection of all the hard work that my team and i have put into making this our strongest collection to date			2
' we have come a long way from starting as a t - shirt brand , and now our product range is not only larger but , having moved to a new factory , the quality is better than ever			0
' and it seems the fashion world is embracing his work			0
the trendy label is currently stocked in 38 stores within the @entity46 - with plans to expand overseas to @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 - and is being worn by @entity51 and @entity52			1

' get the look : speaking about the range , the designer said he feels that the brand has gone from strength to strength over the last three years , and this collection is a reflection of all the hard work that he and his team have put in pensive : @entity4 has become well - known for his trendy style and fans can emulate his look thanks to his clothing range , with t - shirts costing £ 40 and sweatpants costing £ 60 despite looking up to the singers , @entity4 has become quite the trendsetter himself , mainly spearheading the man bun or ' mun ' , which he wears so well			1
so how can men pull off the mun ? ' i think the key is to remember that it is a waiting game , i.e. do n’t try and put it in a bun too early , as some people have done , as it just does n’t look great , ' advised @entity4			2
' just keep growing the top while keeping the back and sides trim			0
then when the length on top is right , bun it up ! ' so @entity11 : away from the sloaney show that sky - rocketed him to fame , @entity4 has his sights set on success in the creative industry , perhaps in music or art one cast member who is a fan of his mun is on - screen love interest , @entity4			1
fans of the @entity117 show were left stunned last sunday when it was revealed that @entity4 had secretly been locking lips with co-star @entity4 - but it seems things may have fizzled out already			1
speaking about his on - screen relationship , he said : ' we are good			0
people are asking a lot of questions about us , as the show is on air at the moment , but what the viewers are seeing , we filmed a while ago			2
quite a lot has changed since then , so you will have to wait and see			2
' despite the status of their romance , @entity4 is a fan of @entity4 's style			0
' @entity4 puts time into the way she looks , and it pays off as she always looks immaculate , ' he said			0
away from the sloaney show that sky - rocketed him to fame , @entity4 has his sights set on success in the creative industry			1
' in five years time , hopefully i 'll still working within the fashion industry			0
i hope that @entity11 will have progressed significantly , to become a well - respected and recognised brand worldwide			0
