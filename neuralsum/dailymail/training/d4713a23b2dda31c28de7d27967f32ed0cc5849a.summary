by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 03:31 est , 6 november 2012 child benefit could only be paid for the first two children under radical reforms being considered at the @entity4			2
senior sources confirmed that as the @entity7 looks to trim more from @entity9 ’s bloated welfare bill , one option is to limit future payments of the handout by family size			0
the proposal goes further than @entity16 @entity15 ’s suggestion that workless families could have child benefit and child tax credits limited if they insist on having more than two children			1
hint at reform : financial secretary to the treasury @entity23 ( left ) said the government was looking at restrictions to child benefit which could go further than those mooted by @entity16 @entity15 ( right ) for families who have more than two children instead , child benefit could be paid to all families , whether in work or not , for the first two offspring but not for subsequent children			1
ministers say benefit would not be removed from existing families , so could only apply in the future			1
the reform would be far simpler to administrate than a complicated means - tested removal of benefit from lower income households			1
the @entity4 has already had to introduce a complex system of means testing at the other end of the income scale , as child benefit is reduced for families where one earner is on more than £ 50,000 and removed altogether from those earning £ 60,000 or more			1
but it would prove hugely controversial among conservative backbenchers , who are already concerned about the backlash generated by chancellor @entity55 ’s existing changes			0
these come into force in january , but at present all parents with young children are given the benefit worth £ 20.30 a week for the first child and £ 13.40 for each subsequent child			2
exploring all options : under the reforms being considered by the @entity4 , families would get child benefit for the first two offspring only ( file picture ) for a couple with two children , it is worth £ 1,752 a year , while for a couple with three children it is worth £ 2,448 a year			1
a senior @entity4 source told the @entity76 : ‘ all options are being looked at in this area			0
‘ it ’s not something we can do retrospectively			0
the main focus is on the incentives that apply to workless households as opposed to working households			2
you could just do that with child tax credits			0
but we are looking in detail at child benefit as well			0
we are looking at various options			0
’ another @entity4 source said : ‘ no details , including whether it would apply to people in work , are settled , and it would only apply to new children			1
’ financial secretary to the treasury @entity23 hinted at broader reform in an interview with @entity103 ’s @entity102 programme			2
controversial : conservative backbenchers are already concerned about the backlash generated by chancellor @entity55 's existing changes to child benefit asked if he supported mr @entity15 ’s ‘ two child policy ’ , mr @entity23 said : ‘ @entity15 has set out a proposal in that area			1
that ’s something that collectively across government we are looking at , including for child benefit			0
‘ clearly that ’s something we would need to look at in some detail but there is a point about the fact that those people who are in work have to make decisions when they have additional children as to whether they can afford to do that or not ... ‘ it ’s important that the welfare system works in such a way that everybody is faced with a degree of responsibility as to the children they have and whether they are able to afford that			1
’ asked whether child benefit might be limited to the first two children , he added : ‘ we are looking at it in terms of the welfare bill across the board as to how that might work			1
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ the government is exploring further options for making the welfare system fairer and more affordable , and details will be announced in due course			0
’ senior conservatives insist that removing or cutting child benefit from the top 15 per cent of earners remains one of the government ’s ‘ most popular policies ’ , with a poll showing that even a majority of those affected back the idea			0
despite warnings of a potential bureaucratic nightmare , and crippling marginal tax rates for higher - earning couples with big families , ministers are pressing ahead with plans to restrict the benefit paid to 1.2million households			1
affected families have started to receive letters from @entity168 giving them the choice of stopping receiving benefit or having cash clawed back at the end of the year through the tax system			2
a @entity175 poll commissioned by the @entity176 found that 82 per cent of people support the policy , including 78 per cent of people with children under the age of 18			0
it was backed by 80 per cent of households with income between £ 41,000 and £ 55,000 .			0

restrictions would apply to all families whether they are in work or not
goes further than @entity15 's plan to merely reduce *payouts* beyond two children
reform would be far simpler than complicated means - tested system
