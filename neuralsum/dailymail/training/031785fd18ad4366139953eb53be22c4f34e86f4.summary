by @entity1 reporter published : 19:59 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 8 september 2013 almost seven out of ten sunbeds fail council safety tests , it has been revealed			1
their output of @entity7 rays breach the legal limit by more than three times in the worst cases and put users at increased risk of cancer			1
the legal limit for sunbed emissions is 0.3 watts per square metre - the equivalent of the midday summer sun in @entity19			1
a woman lies on a sunbed but according to new research at least seven out of ten fail council safety tests nearly seven in 10 sunbeds tested by council inspectors in the north of @entity27 over the past two years pumped out dangerously high levels of uv rays			1
but local authority inspection reports reveal some sunbeds gave out rays more than three times that level			1
critics last night described the revelations as a ' wake - up call ' and demanded tougher regulation of the industry			1
@entity40 , @entity41 for the @entity42 , said : ' local authorities must work together to improve the system to make sure sunbeds are safe , whether that be a requirement that tanning salons are licensed , or those operating the salons have a standard of training			1
' the @entity52 should also get involved because there are serious health implications			0
' of the 448 sunbeds tested by trading standards officers in 2012 and 2013 , an astonishing 310 fell short of safety standards			1
these included all 20 beds tested in @entity60 and 78 out of 103 in @entity61			0
businesses flouting the regulations were all told to re-tube their sunbeds			2
local authorities in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 admitted they had not carried out any tests on sunbeds while others , including @entity74 and @entity75 , said they were planning investigations later in the year			1
only in @entity78 did inspectors put sunbeds out of commission after 131 out of 227 failed for blasting out dangerously high levels of radiation			2
@entity83 , of @entity84 , called on the government to give local authorities more powers to license the industry			0
@entity88 was left devastated after being told she had skin cancer aged only 22 he added : ' sunbeds that fail to meet the @entity93 and @entity94 standard are putting users at even greater risk of skin cancer			1
' @entity97 , of the @entity98 , which represents about 20 per cent of the industry , warned some salon owners would continue to ignore the regulations because the uv emissions inspection regime was so inconsistent			2
he said : ' what is happening is not satisfactory , but local authorities need to toughen up			0
' they should be shutting sunbeds or salons if they fail , but often they do not go back and re-check after testing			2
' those who are compliant are at a financial disadvantage because customers often want a bed with tubes which emit at higher levels because they get a tan easier , so they will lose business to another salon			0
' @entity118 , of law firm @entity119 , said soaring numbers of people with ' horrific ' burns were seeking compensation			0
he added : ' the lack of regulation on tanning salons is frightening			0
' we 're in no doubt that in future we will see a sharp rise in skin cancer linked to sunbed abuse			2
' a @entity134 study this year found some sunbeds emit uv radiation six times stronger than midday @entity19 summer sun. and last year experts at the @entity140 and the @entity141 found that skin cancer - melanoma - can be directly linked to sunbed use			1
it also revealed sunbeds account for almost 900 deaths every year in @entity94			1
@entity147 , of the @entity148 , described our findings as ' alarming '			0
he said : ' we take matters concerning product safety very seriously but it 's unrealistic to expect all sunbeds to be tested by trading standards			2
' the @entity93 's consumer protection system is designed to put the obligation of safety on the businesses who supply such services			0
' @entity162 sunbed user @entity88 was left devastated after being told she had skin cancer aged only 22			2
the output of uv rays from sunbeds breach the legal limit by more than three times in the worst cases and put users at increased risk of cancer the @entity75 hairdresser , now 24 , began visiting tanning salons when she was just 14			1
after a visit to the doctor in 2010 , she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma , caused by a tiny freckle on her leg			0
' i used sunbeds because my friends did and i thought being brown would make me look good , " said miss @entity88 ( left )			0
' i would go in school lunch hour a couple of times a week			0
' i would always choose the stronger sunbed and stay on it for longer than necessary			0
' when i look back now , i ca n't believe that i did it			0
i was stupid and will never go near a sunbed again			0
' without a doubt , using sunbeds is what caused my melanoma , ' said miss @entity88 , who burnt her body several times through sunbed use .			1

legal limit for sunbed emissions is 0.3 watts per square metre - equivalent of the @entity19 midday sun
