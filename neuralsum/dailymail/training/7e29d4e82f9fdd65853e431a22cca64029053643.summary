a council has come under fire after sending tenants an ' insulting ' newsletter telling them to set aside money for court fine , cigarettes , @entity7 and lottery tickets			1
@entity9 sent the advice in a leaflet to thousands of council housing tenants - who reacted with fury at being treated like ' beer - swilling chavs ' like tv 's @entity16			1
the newsletter , which includes a reminder to residents that they have to pay their rent and council tax , was slammed by locals in the @entity26 town as ' an insult ' offering patronising advice			1
leaflet : @entity9 told residents to save money for court fines and lottery tickets the 12 - page bulletin features a section titled ' take control of your money ' , which states : ' working out your budget is all about looking at what money you 've got coming in and what you are spending			1
' it tells tenants to list all their expenditure , adding : ' some things are more important than others so make sure you put these first			0
' you need to pay your rent or you could lose your home			2
electricity and gas bills need paying so you do n't get cut off			0
if you do n't pay your council tax you could go to prison			1
court fines need paying too			1
' in a list of costs which could be incurred by tenants , the council mentions @entity7 or cable tv , lotteries , magistrates ' court fines , cigarettes , tobacco , alcohol , haircuts and child maintenance payments			1
anger : residents claimed they were treated like @entity16 , the layabout father from @entity7 's @entity70 local @entity71 , 28 , said : ' the newsletter makes it sound like every council tenant is like @entity16 in @entity70			1
' not everyone sits about watching @entity7 with a fag and a can of booze just waiting around until they have to go to court			0
' the simple fact that the council included these items just goes to show what they think of their tenants - they think they 're just chavs			0
' another resident , @entity86 , 41 , said : ' this newsletter is an insult to everyone who lives in the town			0
' we are not beer - swilling chavs waiting for a @entity94 ticket to come in , but that 's obviously what the council think of us			0
' patronising : @entity9 council has been accused of not taking its own town , pictured , seriously @entity100 , the @entity101 councillor responsible for housing , said that he would look into how the tactless newsletter came to be distributed			2
' it does n't sound right , ' he said			0
' if the entry for magistrates ' court fines had been pointed out to me i would have queried it at the time			2
i also would n't be encouraging them to put money aside for cigarettes			0
' councillor @entity111 , leader of the @entity113 opposition , said the advice was ' inappropriate ' and painted council tenants in a harsh light			2
' it just struck me as being somewhat odd and , to be frank , rather insulting to suggest that falling foul of the law is a part of everyday life for our council tenants , ' he said			0
a council spokesman said the advice was ' standard debt and budgeting advice ' , adding : ' there are lots of things in the list that will not apply to many council tenants but the list helps them to prioritise the most important payments			2
