a lack of iron , especially in women , is known to trigger hair loss , possibly because it means less oxygen is delivered to the hair follicle , but should you take iron pills to treat it ? ‘ this is a bit of a moot point , ’ says dr @entity9 , a consultant dermatologist at the @entity10 and a specialist in hair loss			1
‘ there is published evidence for and against it			0
all i can say is that in my practice i see lots of girls with low ferritin levels [ stored iron rather than iron in your blood ] , who shed hair and stop shedding once you correct the ferritin level			1
’ meal : eating protein with every meal is vital to strong , healthy hair , as hair consists of protein , experts say @entity35 , a former president of the @entity36 now based at @entity37 , recommends @entity39 pills ( £ 15.95 , lambertshealthcare.co.uk ) , which contain iron , because these do n’t seem to cause the digestive irritation linked to standard pills			1
but professor @entity43 , a consultant dermatologist at the @entity44 in @entity45 , says that while there are many supplements claiming to help promote hair growth , very few have strong evidence to support them			1
two years ago , a clinical trial looked into the efficacy of the supplement @entity54 ( £ 29.99 , @entity55 )			0
the study involved 63 women : 33 took the supplement , 30 a placebo			0
after six months , the hairs in those taking the supplement had increased in width by an average of 7 per cent compared with the placebo group , which were unchanged			2
however , professor messenger remains unconvinced			0
‘ as far as i am aware , this study has not yet been published in a peer - reviewed journal and did not appear to look at other parameters , such as hair density , ’ he says			2
‘ whether a 7 per cent increase in hair diameter can be reliably measured is doubtful , as is whether it is clinically significant			2
’ @entity72 found women with increased hair - shedding responded well to iron supplements it might be worth checking your protein intake			1
as @entity83 , a trichologist , explains : ‘ hair consists of protein , so eating sufficient protein is vital to strong , healthy hair			1
’ he suggests having protein at every meal			2
a good diet including protein is certainly important , says dr @entity9			2
she points to the fact that those with anorexia or a very low @entity90 suffer from hair loss			0
‘ however , i am not sure i can justify saying you need to eat protein at every meal , ’ she says			0
there is some evidence that an amino acid ( or protein building block ) called l - lysine may play a role in hair loss			1
a review published in the @entity101 found that women with increased hair - shedding responded well to l - lysine and iron supplements ( l - lysine is thought to help the body to absorb iron )			1
l - lysine is found in particularly large concentrations in poultry and fish , but it is also in smaller amounts in soy and eggs			0
however , supplements or dietary changes wo n’t pay dividends overnight			1
‘ it usually takes more than two months for the hair follicles to begin to benefit from dietary changes and as hair only grows half an inch a month , it may take as long as six months before you begin to notice any changes , ’ says @entity83			1
‘ but stick with it because perseverance pays off			0
’ the caffeine in @entity129 caffeine liquid hair energiser ( £ 7.49 for 200ml , from chemists ) is said to stimulate weakened hair roots			0
but does it work ? professor @entity43 says that a study published last year shows caffeine can stimulate human hair growth in vitro , ie in a test tube			0
there have also been studies showing caffeine is absorbed quickly through hair follicles , suggesting it could be active when used in a shampoo formulation			1
what is lacking is good clinical trial data showing an effect in vivo , ie in people , he says			0
‘ interestingly , minoxidil , which does prevent hair loss in men , has no effect on hairs growing in a test tube , but does in vivo			0

@entity157 @entity83 says hair consists of protein so eating it is *key*
he adds that dietary changes and supplements wo *n't* pay off overnight
it takes more than two months for hair follicles to begin to benefit , he says
