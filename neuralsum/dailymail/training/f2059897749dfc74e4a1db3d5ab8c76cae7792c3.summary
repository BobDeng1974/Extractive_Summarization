by @entity0 published : 15:37 est , 17 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:47 est , 17 february 2014 a row has erupted after a swingers club opened directly opposite a @entity6 tv station and just yards away from a primary school			1
@entity8 in @entity9 promises late - night sex swapping parties five nights a week and organisers offer to open ' by appointment only ' between 10am - 4pm			1
but the venue has been condemned by a local councillor , who says it is a ' blatant attempt to cash in on people 's sexual interests '			1
controversial : the club , which is offering ' late night sex - swapping parties ' opened opposite the @entity24 headquarters ( on the left ) in @entity9 the swinging club will cost couples £ 25 for a 12 - month membership , allowing them access to six ' playrooms ' , three lounge floors and a couples - only area			1
it also has an 11 - room bed and breakfast			2
it is located yards from @entity39 and directly opposite christian media outlet - @entity40			1
@entity9 councillor @entity41 , said : ' the particularly sordid nature of this club makes me - backed by local residents - even more determined to block this blatant attempt to cash in on people ’s sexual interests			1
opposition : councillor @entity41 says the ' sordid ' nature of the venue makes her determined to block it ' if someone wants to live a " swinging lifestyle " let them do it in their own homes - not on the doorsteps of @entity61 residents , around the corner from a local school and near places of worship			1
' swinging , where couples swap sexual partners , is not illegal , but @entity69 said the club needs planning permission to operate - which @entity73 ’s owners do not have			1
@entity69 confirmed the authority had not given the club the go - ahead			2
a spokesperson from @entity69 said : ' the use of the premises as a swingers ’ club is unauthorised and needs planning permission			1
' all planning applications are considered on their individual merits and have to undergo a statutory period of public consultation			2
' this gives local residents , businesses and community partners the opportunity to make their views known on proposed developments within their area			0
' @entity73 ’s organisers , who claim to have 20 years ’ experience of the swinging scene , boast on their website : ' we want to break the stereotypical ideals people have about swinging and hopefully bring something fresh and vibrant to our venue			0
' anger : it was opened just yards away from @entity39 @entity73 said : ' we are a private members club who offer a safe discreet environment for professional people to meet like minded people			2
we do not promise sex swap parties , that has been hyped up			2
' what about transvestites and cross dressers , do they not have a human right to frequent establishments like this where they are free to express themselves			0
clients such as these and single girls who have enquired do not feel safe in town centres			0
' the issue of binge drinkers and louts in the city centre at weekends should be far more of a concern			0
' as for the @entity40 , @entity41 is using this as a pitiful excuse			1
the bible states no man should lie with another man yet churches allow gay marriage			0
' also if ms @entity41 is so concerned for her patch why are our neighbours the lifeline centre , where heroin addicts are given methodone and numerous amount of used needles are found right near the school in back lanes etc. ' @entity148 house and the @entity149 are dens for drug addicts and alcoholics who are frequently seen drunk at 8am in the morning			2
there is nothing of danger or offensive about professional couples entering a building and the door closed behind them			0
' also she mentions about keeping it in their home , how is that possible ? people have families and neighbours to think about			0
' swinging couples are spicing up a relationship and that is far better than affairs and divorce affecting the family unit and devastating children			0
this lifestyle keeps families together			0
' it is 2014 and we will fight and defend our corner as far as we can			0
