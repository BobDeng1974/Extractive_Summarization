by @entity0 published : 20:00 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 14:41 est , 25 october 2013 cheerleader : @entity2 , the environment secretary , said public opposition to @entity5 foods had softened consumers no longer care about the issue of @entity5 crops , the environment secretary claims			1
@entity2 insisted genetically modified products should be cultivated and manufactured in @entity11 and said they would cut costs for hard - pressed shoppers			1
mr @entity2 , a @entity15 cheerleader for the technology , which @entity11 has resisted , said consumers had accepted a move to allow shops to sell meat from animals raised on @entity5 feed , suggesting public opposition had softened			1
he added : ‘ it is impossible to detect			0
if an animal , a chicken or a pig , has eaten @entity5 material , you ca n’t tell			2
the fact that the public did n’t react to that was very interesting			2
’ his latest intervention prompted an angry response from @entity36 campaigners , who accused him of misrepresenting the evidence and taking voters ’ views for granted			0
mr @entity2 , in an interview for political magazine , @entity43 , said consumers had happily accepted a move to allow meat from animals fed on @entity5 animal feed , suggesting controversy had dimmed			1
‘ i thought it was very interesting when some of the main retailers [ @entity53 and others ] felt that they could no longer tell their consumers that they were selling meat products which had not consumed @entity5 material at some stage because nearly all our animal feed now has contained some @entity5 ‘ of course it is undetectable , it is impossible to detect			2
if an animal , a chicken or a pig has eaten @entity5 material , you ca n’t tell			2
i thought the fact that the public did n’t react to that was very interesting			0
’ the minister insisted that @entity5 had been grown across much of the rest of the world for many years and there were no reports of any adverse impact			2
‘ there are 17 million farmers cultivating 170m hectares which is 12 per cent of the world ’s arable land , which is seven times the surface area of the @entity11 and not a single person has come to me with a report of any health problem , ’ he said			2
‘ the fact that every single member of the @entity87 has been on holiday to @entity89 and has come back happily , healthy and sane shows that this is a technology which can feed the world			0
it ’s not the only solution but it is a very valuable technology			1
’ the environment secretary , who is thought to want @entity5 products widely available on supermarket shelves by the end of the decade , added : ‘ it would be good to grow some @entity5 crops in this country because some of these products would be cheaper which helps our consumers , who are under a lot of pressure			1
we all know the cost of living and the cost of food has become an issue			0
’ he also claimed there were ‘ massive environmental gains ’			0
‘ there are huge reductions in spraying ... there would be massive savings in pretty strong chemicals which we spray the whole time , huge savings in diesel , huge savings in compaction of soil , there ’s no doubt about it			0
that ’s a straight help to agriculture			0
’ mr @entity2 also saidn ‘ agritechnology ’ , which covers @entity5 crops and conventional crop manipulation , represents a major business opportunity for @entity11 and was an industry in which the country should become a world leader			1
‘ we have top class research institutions ... when i was in @entity139 i was talking to other companies and i would love them to come here			0
' this does n’t have to be gm. we are looking at a conventional wheat development which could increase the yield of wheat by 25 per cent , i would love that to be done here			0
criticism : opponents of mr @entity2 said adopting @entity5 food could harm @entity11 's reputation ‘ i would like the @entity11 to become the leading nation in @entity152 for agritechnology			1
i would really like to go a whole step further			0
’ mr @entity2 insisted that products were being cleared by watchdogs for human consumption , but then blocked across @entity152 because of political resistance			2
‘ @entity160 , products pass through the very rigorous scientific process and then get stuck at the political level			0
so we are talking at member state level to other member states to see if we can get this moving			0
because at the moment @entity152 is going to fall further and further behind , ’ he said			0
mr @entity2 caused controversy earlier this month when he said millions of children in the developing world are ‘ dying or going blind ’ because @entity5 crops , some of which are desgined to boost vitamin content , have not been more widely adopted			1
dr @entity173 , of @entity174 , which campaigns to ensure any use of @entity5 is in the public interest , said : ‘ there would be a massive disadvantage to @entity11 ’s reputation for good farming if we grew @entity5 crops in @entity11			1
‘ the evidence shows that @entity5 crops which are resistant to weedkillers actually increase the amount of spraying which harms wildlife			2
polls show that the public wants meat , milk and dairy products fed on @entity5 animal feed to be labelled			1
then we would have a better gauge of whether people actually want to buy it			0
‘ i think @entity2 will be surprised by the reaction if he tries to have @entity5 crops grown in this country			1
there are still very many people who are strongly opposed to this technology , and growing them here would cause a big backlash			0
’ due to the controversy when @entity5 technology was first adopted in the 1990s , there are only a handful of products containing @entity5 crops currently available on @entity11 high streets			1
currently , there are no commercial @entity5 crops in @entity11 , but livestock is commonly reared on imported @entity5 feed			1
but the prime minister , the government ’s chief scientific adviser , sir @entity214 , and science minister @entity216 have all voiced support for @entity5 the scientific community also overwhelmingly supports its wider use , with experts insisting each product must be judged on its merits rather than damning a whole technology .			1

@entity2 said public opposition to @entity5 food has softened
he described it as ' a very valuable technology '
but critics said adopting @entity5 *methods* could damage @entity11 's reputation for good farming
