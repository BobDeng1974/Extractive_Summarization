‘ pupils may have first thought that this was some kind of exciting adventure , but they soon saw all the trouble that @entity8 and @entity9 ’s actions have caused			1
‘ they also saw that sooner or later they had to face the consequences of their actions , which have led to @entity8 and @entity9 being unable to return to school			1
‘ all of a sudden it no longer looks like such a good idea			0
