the 6.0 - magnitude earthquake that jolted parts of @entity2 today served as a reminder of just how active the seemingly - solid ground beneath us can be			1
and these reminders have become increasingly frequent			0
on average , the world only sees one or two earthquakes per month that are 6.5 - magnitude or higher			1
but april produced a higher - than - normal number of the major seismic events , as revealed in this incredible time - lapse video			1
magnitude 3 – silght tremor felt by people indoors , likened to a passing lorry			0
magnitude 4 – can crack walls , disturb trees			0
magnitude 5 – moves furniture , damages poorly built buildings			0
magnitude 6 – moderate to major damage , chimneys and walls collapse			0
magnitude 7 – major damage to all buildings , ground cracks , landslides can occur			0
magnitude 8 – total destruction , waves can be seen travelling through the ground			0
earthquakes happen every day , and as this animation shows , small ones happen at least once an hour			0
according to the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , which issues alerts for tsunamis , there were 13 major earthquakes in april			1
five were higher than 7.8 , which prompted tsunami warnings			0
moderate - to - large earthquakes are less common , but last month was ‘ easily a record for this institution , ’ according to the @entity38			1
the time - lapse takes you on a journey of all recorded large and medium - sized earthquakes that took place from january through to april of this year			1
the @entity53 appears calm up until april 1 when a huge 8.2 magnitude earthquake rocks northern chile the @entity53 continues to shake with another earthquake that hits the @entity57 in the @entity58 the @entity53 appears calm up until april 1 when a huge 8.2 magnitude earthquake rocks northern @entity54			1
from there , the @entity53 continues to shake with another huge earthquake that hits the @entity57 in the @entity58			1
the activity does n’t let up all month			1
but what is interesting , according to the @entity38 , is the sheer number of other earthquakes that were n't part of these two major clusters			1
there were isolated larger - than - normal quakes all over the world — in @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , and even an unusual one in the @entity73			1
the @entity74 gave no indication to what might have been behind the huge change in seismic activity			2
the animation concludes with a summary map showing all of the earthquakes in this four - month period			2

the animation concludes with a summary map showing all of the earthquakes in this four - month period scientists from @entity95 claim fracking could cause powerful earthquakes capable of destroying buildings as the process of extracting gas weakens fault lines deep underground			2
@entity104 geologists said that a domino effect of quakes could be caused by intense pressure on fault lines created by hydraulic fracturing , combined with seismic activity thousands of miles away			2
the @entity95 scientists maintain that powerful earthquakes can trigger swarms of minor quakes near waste water injection wells like those used for in oil and gas recovery			2
they say a recent surge in @entity104 oil and gas production using vast amounts of water to crack open rocks and release natural shale gas has been linked to an increase in small to moderate induced earthquakes in five states			0
seismologists from the university have identified three quakes in @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 that they believe were triggered at injection well sites by a major earthquake a long distance away			2
the discovery , published in the journal @entity137 by one of the world 's leading seismology labs , threatens to make fracking even more controversial			0
a joint @entity143 study of hydraulic fracturing by @entity145 and the @entity146 said that fracking can be managed effectively in the @entity143 as long as operational best practices are implemented and robustly enforced through regulation			0
the experts also said that earth tremors induced by hydraulic fracturing are likely to be of a smaller magnitude than the @entity143 naturally experiences or than is related to coal mining activities .			0
