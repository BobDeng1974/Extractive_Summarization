in the letter , @entity1 wrote to her husband @entity28 that she was ' so , so sorry ' for killing the boys , and that she ' struggling ' to take @entity22 's life			1
@entity1 broke down in hysterics yesterday after the letter was read to a jury at the @entity2 , and had to be excused from court to be taken back to hospital			1
according to @entity37 , the letter reads : ' @entity28 , i need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take @entity42 's life			1
i am so ghastly and i feel every ounce of it for doing this			2
' the boys were bad enough			2
i am struggling with @entity42			0
i waited until the boys were asleep			0
if i could take my own life and leave her to wait for you i would			0
but the wait will be as traumatic			0
' this is so bad and i am so , so sorry			0
my only solace is that pain and future suffering i am saving her from			0
' @entity1 was assigned a new , less experienced social worker in an ‘ ill - conceived ’ decision two months before she suffocated her three disabled children , a court heard yesterday			1
she has admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility			2
@entity1 and her husband had been supported for 15 months by social worker @entity63 , who was ‘ specifically chosen because she had expertise in looking after children under the age of five ’ , the @entity2 heard			1
but she was ‘ suddenly replaced ’ by ‘ younger and less experienced ’ @entity68 and quit her job soon afterwards			2
' @entity28 , i need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take @entity42 's life			1

' i am so sorry			0
this life is better without me			0
' the only thing giving me the motivation to continue is the belief that the boys are already playing up in heaven like they could never play here			0
i can seem them running around ... ' @entity1 , 43 , killed the children before trying to kill herself at the £ 2million family home in @entity97 , @entity98 , while her husband was in @entity101 with the couple ’s eldest child , now eight , who does not suffer from the condition – @entity106 type 2			1
outlining the case ahead of sentencing , prosecutor @entity107 yesterday said the ‘ disruption ’ of @entity114 being replaced happened partly because the social services department thought she ‘ had got too close ’ to @entity1 and was not having monthly meetings with the children			1
‘ miss @entity63 resigned soon afterwards			2
miss @entity68 became the @entity116 social worker just six months after she joined @entity118 social services , ’ she said			1
‘ with hindsight that perhaps was an ill - conceived decision by the social services department			1
' friends said @entity1 ‘ constantly felt under pressure and criticised by social services ’ and had been ‘ very derogatory about @entity118 social services ’ , the court heard			1
@entity125 , defending , criticised the actions of the ‘ inexperienced social worker ’ and said her predecessor resigned ‘ in disgust ’ after being moved off their case because she was an ‘ advocate for the family ’			1
last night @entity134 said a serious case review was ongoing			0
in a letter @entity1 wrote for her husband dated april 20 – two days before the killings – she told how she made up her mind two days earlier , on @entity140 , ‘ to say goodbye ’ and her ‘ plan ’ had given her inner peace , the court heard			1
proud father : mr @entity1 with his three - year - old twin sons , @entity20 and @entity21 , who were smothered along with their sister @entity22 pictured : @entity17 inside a prison van at a previous hearing and she has been held at a secure mental unit which can not be named crime scene : the @entity2 heard mrs @entity17 lied to a nanny so she could be alone with the children and then killed them , before putting them in funeral poses she wrote : ‘ i can not face going down this path watching @entity42 and the boys continue to get weaker			1
‘ most importantly , the interference in our lives ( you know : @entity161 [ @entity161 ] , @entity162 , @entity163 )			0
i am tired of it all			0
no matter what we overcome , no matter what we do , it will never be enough			0
’ the court heard there was a ‘ fundamental tension between @entity1 and mrs @entity17 and the plethora of medical professionals involved in the care of the children ’			1
@entity174 , known as @entity175 to the family , was duped into leaving @entity17 alone while she killed her children			1
she had been told mrs @entity17 's mother was visiting only to discover it was a lie			1
she then rushed to the south - west @entity181 home where she found the mother injured and the children dead in their beds			1
mrs @entity17 then handed her a letter which read : ' i am so sorry i had to do this but i could not carry on			1
i also could not leave the children with @entity28			1
it would have been too much for him			0
' you have been the most amazing person in our lives over the last few years			0
without you i most likely would have done this a lot sooner			0
please do n't think that there was anything more you could have done to avoid this			0
' please believe me when i say that you did far too much as is			0
there was nothing more you could have done			0
you were / are perfect			0
i am so sorry i had to end things this way			0
' please look after @entity203 for me			2
@entity203 and @entity28 still need you ( very much )			1
' they included those from @entity161 and @entity134 , which provides support for disabled children and their families from its @entity209 in @entity211			2
when the case was handed over to @entity118 , the documents included a quote from @entity1 ‘ stating that she did n’t want to see her children ’s suffering prolonged ’ , miss @entity212 said			1
relations between doctors and the family reached such a crisis in 2013 that medics were ‘ actively considering child protection measures on the basis of neglect ’ , miss @entity212 said , although the children were ‘ happy and looked after ’			2
there were ‘ up to 60 professionals ’ involved with the three children , ‘ often descending in groups on the home ’ , the prosecutor said			2
‘ one can well imagine how intrusive that felt			2
’ yesterday it was also revealed for the first time that @entity1 smothered the twins while they were asleep using a nappy ‘ so they could n’t smell her ’			1
she later told a doctor she killed all three children between midnight and 5am on april 22 , the court heard			1
she found it harder to kill @entity22 and wrote a letter to her husband between killing the boys and her daughter			1
in it she said : ‘ @entity28 , i need to tell you how difficult it is for me to take @entity42 ’s life … if i could take my own life and leave her to wait for you i would … my only solace is the pain and future suffering i am saving her from			2
i am so sorry … ‘ the only thing giving me the motivation to continue is the belief that the boys are already playing up in heaven like they could never play here			0
’ yesterday @entity1 stared at the dock floor clutching a tissue in her left hand , sobbing as she listened to the beginning of the prosecutor ’s speech			1
mr @entity1 , a banker , sat by the dock door			2
but after 20 minutes , before the details of how the children ’s bodies were found were disclosed , she became too upset and was excused by the judge , mr @entity272			2
the judge reserved sentencing until tuesday			0
an earlier version of this article followed incorrect agency copy in quoting @entity125 as saying that there was no evidence mrs @entity17 would have harmed a hair on her children ’s head but for the illness they suffered			1
in fact her said she would not have harmed her children but for her illness			2
we are happy to set the record straight			0
