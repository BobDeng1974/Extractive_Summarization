@entity0 believes @entity1 will not be engulfed by external pressure when they tackle @entity3 in a two - @entity5 series later this month			1
@entity1 ' record against the @entity3 does not augur well for appointments in @entity8 on june 14 and @entity9 seven days later			1
they have beaten @entity3 just once in 27 attempts - and that was at the @entity13 15 years ago - while they will fly out on thursday minus injured stars such as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
focus : @entity0 believes @entity1 will not be engulfed by external pressure when they tackle @entity3 tricky task : @entity0 is likely to line up opposite @entity23 wing superstar @entity22 but @entity24 wing @entity0 is not daunted by the task that awaits @entity1 in the two tests and the clash against @entity28 on june 10			1
' there is definitely confidence , ' he said			2
' our squad has been together for three to four years , and the confidence we have in each other is really high			2
' we just need a bit more consistency and the bit of luck that every test team needs			2
' we are just looking forward to getting down there , and we will hopefully put in a performance over the three games			0
' there are not many people ( pundits ) putting pressure on us , so we will just go out there and play			0
everyone expects us to lose , but we are quietly ( confident ) within the squad			0
' we are just going to take each game as it comes			0
we have a game on the tuesday against @entity28 , so we will see what the team will be			0
hopefully , we will get the win , and then we will prepare for the test			0
' @entity0 is likely to line up opposite @entity23 wing superstar @entity22 , who is fresh from a @entity57 and @entity58 top 14 trophy double with @entity59 and remains one of world rugby 's deadliest finishers			1
wants to get started : @entity0 is relishing the challenge of playing the two tests over in @entity3 it is a challenge , though , that @entity0 will relish			1
' he has to be one of those ( wings ) at the top , ' @entity0 added			0
' think of those tries he scored against @entity70 last season			0
if he had n't got injured ( in that game ) , @entity3 probably would have won			1
' watching him over the years , he 's been a world - class player and has sort of changed the way wingers play in terms of how they get involved in the game			1
' it 's just the amount of touches he has per game			1
he does n't just stay on the wing , he comes in off 10 , nine , first receiver , and his kick - chase is probably one of the best in the business as well			0
' he still has that influence in the @entity3 squad - it shows how important he is to them			1
he is such a threat from anywhere			0
' he has all that experience now			0
winning the @entity92 and all the other trophies that he has won , he 's just about as high up there as any winger can be			2
' it 's definitely a good yardstick to face him			1
i 've played against a lot of other top wingers - ( @entity70 's ) @entity100 is probably one of the toughest opponents i have faced - but @entity22 is going to be right up there			2
i am looking forward to the challenge , if i am selected			0
