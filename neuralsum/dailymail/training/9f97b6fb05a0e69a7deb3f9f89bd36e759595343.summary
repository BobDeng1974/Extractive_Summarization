@entity1 's owners insist @entity3 ' position is not even up for discussion as he seeks to get their dreadful season on an even keel			1
the manager admitted his job would be on the line after his side crashed to their fourth consecutive defeat at @entity13 on sunday and that he was ' not arrogant enough ' to think he was safe regardless			1
but as he prepares to take @entity1 to @entity15 for their vital @entity17 clash with @entity18 , there is not even the slightest suggestion that @entity20 , the club 's @entity22 owners , are contemplating making a change			1
@entity3 , frustrated on the touchline at @entity13 , is safe in his job as @entity1 boss for now @entity1 co-owners @entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) are set to stick with @entity3 as manager they backed @entity3 in the summer when giving him a new four - year contract after he had guided @entity1 to within two points of winning the title and showed their support by giving him Â£ 116million to re-shape the squad following the sale of @entity38			1
@entity3 frequently says he has ' good communication ' with @entity20 's main men - @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity41 - and @entity20 remain convinced last season 's @entity43 is the man to take @entity1 forward for the long - term			1
speaking after his side 's 3 - 1 defeat at @entity48 on sunday , @entity3 said : ' any manager will tell you that you have to win games and get results , particularly after the way we have been developing as a club			1
' i have great communication with the owners			2
we 've been honest enough with each other and we have to get results			2
' you have to perform			0
owners and directors and chairmen have to see development on the field			2
three straight league defeats , and no points in november , have left @entity1 in real trouble in the league injuries to @entity70 have highlighted @entity3 ' team 's lack of attacking threat up front this season ' barring this period , our development has been very good and fast			1
but there 's no doubt you have to get results			0
' that will support the confidence to the owners , and you take it from there			2
i will only ever do my best			0
' the best has seen us develop well			0
now i must fight even harder			0
the full responsibility comes down to me			0
' now i have to fight even harder and take the responsibility			0
as manager , the responsibility comes down to me and any pressure comes on to me			0
' video we need results - @entity3			1
