by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:55 est , 13 may 2013 updated : 11:54 est , 13 may 2013 defence secretary @entity2 is known in @entity3 for being a hard - nosed @entity4 , with a keen eye for cutting costs			1
but his strait - laced , right - wing reputation suffered a blow today after he was revealed to have been a goth who read left - wing newspapers during his schooldays			1
the claim was all the more bizarre coming from former classmate , tv and radio host @entity19			2
makeover : defence secretary @entity2 ( left ) was a ' goth ' - like rock singer @entity22 - when at school , tv presenter @entity23 has claimed mr @entity2 is making headlines after defying @entity26 to say he would vote to leave @entity27 if there was a referendum now			1
the former businessman is now known for being a hardline conservative , particularly on spending taxpayers money having served as @entity34 ’s deputy in opposition			0
but it seems he was much less buttoned - up when a schoolboy growing up in @entity38			1
in fact he was regularly reprimanded about not having his top button done up , slouching in official school photos			0
mr @entity19 revealed on @entity42 that he was ‘ at school with @entity45 - a @entity44 back then ’			1
he is understood to have made a similar claim during a radio show in 2011 , although sources close to mr @entity2 suggested it was a ' wind - up '			1
the pair were in the same class at @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity38 in the 1970s			2
mr @entity19 added that the future @entity4 cabinet minister who appears at the @entity60 in well - tailored suits ‘ used to arrive in class in leather trench - coat with @entity56 under his arm ’			2
@entity19 's tweet threatened to undermine mr @entity2 's reputation as a hard - nosed conservative even in official school photographs , mr @entity2 took a laidback approach			1
in this picture from 1970 he is seen ( circled ) slouching with his top button undone , in contrast to his sharp apperance today mr @entity19 made the revelation as mr @entity2 suggested he would vote to leave the @entity72 if there was a referendum now			1
mr @entity26 today slapped him down , saying ministers should not answer ‘ hypothetical questions ’			0
mr @entity19 said the prime minister had suffered a long weekend after mr @entity2 , and education secretary @entity78 had parked their ‘ tanks on his lawn ’			1
mr @entity2 was born in @entity82 in @entity38 in december 1995			1
the son of a civil engineer , he went to @entity86 school in @entity53 before studying @entity87 at @entity88			0
he later worked in the private sector , for medical equipment and building firms , before becoming @entity4 mp for @entity93 and @entity94 in 1997			0
he looks back fondly on his youth			0
‘ i had some very fond memories of school , ’ mr @entity2 told the @entity96 last year			2
tv presenter @entity19 made the claim about mr @entity2 's secret past after he spoke out on the @entity72 he revealed how he made the decision to go to @entity88 in 1970 , which set him on course to one day join the @entity103			1
he said : ‘ @entity104 had been in office , but i did n't get anything he did			0
‘ i remember the day after the general election when @entity104 had lost , i remember quite clearly cycling from my house in @entity109 along @entity110 and feeling what a relief to live in a country with a @entity4 government again			0
’ he said he later bumbed into his headteacher			0
' i had n't really decided that until that moment			0
but i suppose everything else flowed from there			0
my life would have been totally different if it had n't been for that			0
' what i 'm trying to say is that if you see an opportunity you have to grab it – it might not come round again			0
' over the weekend mr @entity2 gave mr @entity26 a headache with his assertion that he would vote to leave the @entity72			1
asked on the @entity130 ’s @entity129 radio programme whether he would vote to leave the @entity72 as things stand , replied : ‘ yes , because i believe that we have to negotiate a better solution that works better for @entity134 if we are going to stay in and play a part in the @entity72 in the future			1
' but let me be absolutely clear : i think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the @entity72			2
' we ’re going to try and change the rules and change the way it works and change the objectives that it has in order to make it something that works for @entity134			0
' however , he added : ' if the choice is between an @entity72 exactly as it is today and not being a part of that then i have to say that i ’m on the side of the argument that @entity78 has put forward			2

defence secretary 's reputation as hard - nosed conservative takes a knock
*broadcaster* @entity19 lifts the lid on their @entity38 schooldays
@entity2 slapped down by @entity165 for saying he would vote to leave the @entity72
