by @entity0 @entity1 are keen on @entity3 starlet @entity2			1
the @entity5 and @entity6 champions face @entity3 at @entity7 tomorrow in the @entity9 quarter - final , first leg and have been monitoring the impact made by 19 - year - old @entity2 since he broke into the first team last summer			1
@entity13 made an offer for @entity2 early in the season which was rejected by @entity3 and they will maintain that stance should any other club attempt to lure away their brightest young star			1
@entity1 , who remain keen on a summer deal for @entity36 defender @entity35 , are scouting across the world for versatile attacking players who can succeed the likes of @entity40 and @entity41 , who have both turned 30			1
they have yet to make an offer for @entity2 but their interest is strong			0
getting ready : @entity2 could feature in @entity3 's @entity9 quarter - final with @entity1 over the next week summer target : @entity1 also have @entity36 's @entity35 on their shortlist equally , @entity3 will not entertain bids as they look to show that , despite this season ’s dramatic dip in results , they still have the power to hold onto their young stars and attract new ones			1
the loss of @entity56 is still a sore point and the club want to ensure that scenario is not repeated			2
meanwhile , @entity60 are among the clubs showing an interest in @entity3 right - back @entity63			2
the 22 - year - old @entity64 is on loan at @entity67 side @entity66			1
@entity68 of clubs interested in @entity70 @entity71 are maintaining an interest in @entity74 midfielder @entity73 despite the @entity75 agreeing a new contract			1
scouts watched the 22 - year - old score in saturday ’s 3 - 3 draw with @entity1 and the playmaker again impressed with his all - round performance			0
interest : @entity71 are one of a number of clubs looking at @entity74 midfielder @entity73 ( left ) on target : @entity86 ( right ) celebrates after earning @entity74 a shock 3 - 3 draw at @entity6 champions @entity1 on saturday he has been watched by @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity36 , @entity3 and @entity92 this season and last week agreed a two - year extension to a contract that was due to run out in 2015			1
he is valued at around £ 12million but @entity86 has yet to be capped by @entity96 and is yet to secure an @entity98 passport , that could cause a problem for any subsequent work permit hearing			2
@entity9 contenders @entity71 are drawing up a list of targets as they look to strengthen in attack , midfield and at centre - back for next season			2
@entity64 starlet @entity107 watched by @entity3 and @entity36 @entity108 , remember the name			1
the 15 - year - old @entity27 defender was watched closely by scouts from @entity36 and @entity3 last week as he played for @entity112 in the @entity113 in @entity114			1
the spring - haired teenager , who has drawn comparisons to @entity36 ’s @entity35 in appearance , turns 16 on thursday and is another product of @entity120 ’s youth system			2
conveyor belt : young @entity64 talent @entity108 ( left ) is being watched by @entity3 and @entity36 scouts his style and ability on the ball has got clubs discussing figures already and @entity120 will be holding out for around £ 2million in compensation			1
another @entity120 starlet @entity130 is expected to complete a deal with @entity132 despite late interest from @entity91 in the 16 - year - old winger			0
@entity135 and @entity136 in chase for powell @entity135 and @entity136 want to sign @entity3 midfielder @entity139 in a permanent deal this summer			1
@entity141 are also keen to take the 20 - year - old should they gain promotion after @entity139 scored his 12th goal of the season at the weekend			1
however , manager @entity29 would prefer for @entity139 to go out on loan again for another season and this time to a @entity149 club so the teams in contention may yet get their wish but only on a temporary basis			2
permanence : @entity139 could be snapped up by @entity135 or @entity136 when his loan spell at @entity141 ends @entity156 revamped inter next season @entity92 striker @entity21 is emerging as the preferred option for @entity90 ahead of @entity36 ’s @entity159			1
@entity21 has scored 22 goals in 44 games for club and country this season and @entity90 are keen for him to spearhead their revamped squad for next season			0
they have been keen on the 28 - year - old for some time and his form has only cemented their view that he could be the man to help them challenge @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			2
revamp : @entity92 's @entity21 could lead @entity90 's forward line next season no rush : @entity92 will be reluctant to let the @entity178 front man leave until they have found a replacement @entity92 , however , are not in any rush to sell unless they find a suitable replacement			0
they would want close to £ 18m as they look to balance out any improvements of their own in the summer with a defensive midfielder and centre - back among their own priorities			0
@entity21 is understood to be on less wages than @entity159 but that fee will be the sticking point for @entity90 as they look to add a top striker and five other signings			0
@entity194 squad could go for nothing there will be a lot of interest focused on @entity201 ’s appeal hearing today as he fights to buy @entity194			0
@entity201 was disqualified as a potential owner by the @entity203 last week after being found guilty in an @entity205 court of failing to pay € 388,500 of import tax on a yacht			0
the @entity205 businessman had agreed in february to buy 75 per cent of @entity194 from the @entity210 - based investment bank @entity209			0
in court : @entity201 will attend an appeal hearing on monday after the @entity203 disqualified him as a potential owner of @entity194 over unpaid taxes on a yacht representatives from the law firm @entity217 are to argue that @entity201 is innocent under @entity205 law until an appeal against the import tax ruling is finalised			0
@entity194 playing staff received only 50 percent of their wages last week as the club struggled to cover debts without @entity226 ’s cash			0
should the financial situation deteriorate then @entity194 will be wary of not being able to pay the players wages which is reputed to total around £ 18million a year			0
if players go 14 days without any payment at all those players are able to leave on free transfers as happened at @entity233 .			0
