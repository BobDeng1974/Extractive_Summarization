an educational video warning schoolgirls about @entity3 grooming gangs was commissioned for schools in 2007 but was never promoted in the @entity5 amid fears of appearing racist			1
the 20 - minute film , my dangerous @entity9 , features an @entity3 man in his 20s grooming a younger white girl - lavishing her with gifts and getting her drunk before forcing her to have sex for money			1
it was commissioned by child protection chiefs based in @entity21 following reports of vulnerable girls being passed around groups of men for sex , according to a tv producer who worked on the project			1
@entity21 has since been shaken by the revelation that 1,400 girls were abused by @entity3 gangs in the town of @entity42 between 1997 and 2013			1
the female tv producer , who preferred not to be named : said : ' the project was set up to specifically raise schoolkids ' awareness of the dangers			0
' the police and social workers were very clear it was @entity3 men who were seducing white @entity5 girls			2
' i ca n't help wondering how many girls the film might have saved from being sexually exploited if the @entity56 and police had put their needs before political correctness			2
' she said that men would find young girls in shopping centres and win their affections before forcing them to have sex with their male friends			0
despite winning plaudits at international media festivals , the video was hardly used as it was thought not to be politically correct the movie was produced by a company called @entity72 , who say the aim was to ' open up people 's eyes to the harsh realities of sexual exploitation '			1
it was also commissioned by the @entity5 @entity80 ( @entity56 ) , which is now part of the @entity82			0
at the time of its release , the @entity56 said : ' we want this film to create awareness of the circumstances in which this kind of exploitation can occur , and encourage vigilance from everyone in a position to notice the behavioural and physical signs that indicate abuse			0
' a spokesman from @entity99 today said : ' the film was officially launched in 2010 and the annual @entity102 conference			0
' it was put on the @entity56 website , sent to every police force and to child protection agencies			2
' the video was commissioned by child protection chiefs based in @entity21 following reports of vulnerable girls being passed around groups of men for sex , according to a tv producer who worked on the project they were unwilling to offer a comment on why it was never made compulsory for schools and was only seen in a few classrooms			1
@entity121 , head of children 's services in @entity42 between 2005 and 2010 , resigned as @entity124 for @entity21 last week following weeks of intense pressure to quit			1
@entity126 , director of children 's services at the time of the scandal also quit on friday			0
the resignations follow last month 's report , from professor @entity133 , which indicated that at least 1,400 children were abused between 1997 and 2013 in @entity42 amid widespread failings by authorities			1
the devastating report made ' painful reading ' for the police force covering the town , its chief constable admitted			0
@entity143 , chief executive of @entity144 , also stepped down after the findings , which suggested that the authorities were too scared to take action against the gangs for fear of appearing racist			0
over the 16 - year period , children as young as 11 were sexually exploited by gangs of men – most of them of @entity156 origin .			2

the 20 - minute film was commissioned by child protection chiefs in @entity21
' my dangerous @entity9 ' features an @entity3 man grooming young white girl
it was made following reports of sexual abuse , according to film 's producer
but never *properly* promoted as many feared it was not politically correct
