president @entity1 's summer vacation off the @entity3 coast has come to an end			1
the president returned to the @entity6 late sunday after spending two weeks with his family on the island of @entity9			1
what a break it turned out to be			0
his attempt at rest and relaxation was largely overtaken by events involving @entity18 militants in @entity19 and @entity20 , including the videotaped execution of an @entity23 journalist they had been holding hostage , and the unrest in @entity26 , @entity27 , following the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man			0
the unusual midvacation return to @entity49 had been scheduled before those issues came to dominate the news			0
still , in the midst of daily briefings on these and other matters , telephone consultations with world leaders and other responsibilities , @entity1 squeezed in nine rounds of golf on the island he has made his summer presidential retreat while shrugging off criticism about how he was spending the time away from @entity49			1
@entity23 president @entity1 , first lady @entity32 and daughter @entity33 walk off @entity63 at @entity64 in @entity65 @entity1 broke from his vacation to deliver statements on @entity19 , @entity27 and journalist @entity43 on four separate occasions , including one delivered during two days he spent back at the @entity6 in the middle of the getaway ' just because the president is in a different location does n't mean he 's not doing his job , ' @entity6 spokesman @entity69 said			1
@entity1 also ate dinner out a few times , danced at a birthday party for the wife of @entity49 powerbroker @entity77 , treated first lady @entity32 to a jazz performance and took the family to a fireworks show near the home of senior adviser @entity82 , who also was vacationing on @entity9			2
@entity1 returned @entity83 , @entity49 once during the vacation to attend national security meetings with senior staff in coming weeks , @entity1 will travel to @entity87 , @entity88 , before stops in @entity90 and @entity91 on friday to raise money for @entity94 candidates ahead of the november midterm elections before leaving on sunday , @entity1 and his wife went hiking with friends near the @entity33 ' rental home in @entity99 , on the western part of the island			0
the @entity6 did not identify the friends			2
back at the @entity6 , @entity1 will have to decide whether @entity43 's killing and the broader threat the @entity105 extremist group poses to @entity23 interests in the region and elsewhere is reason enough to now seek to intervene militarily in @entity20			1
" just because the president is in a different location does n't mean he 's not doing his job , " @entity6 spokesman @entity69 said to critics of the president 's leisure activities he has resisted going that route for three years , even as the death toll in @entity20 's civil war approached 200,000 , the government used chemical weapons against its people and the @entity18 group grew more powerful amid the chaos			1
pressure to go after the @entity18 inside @entity20 is coming from @entity1 's own military leaders , as well as some of his critics in @entity127			2
@entity1 also must weigh that thirst for forceful action against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the @entity23 into a country that has been torn apart by an intractable internal conflict			0
@entity6 officials have suggested that airstrikes in @entity20 are an option , though the officials say specific military proposals have yet to be presented to the president			1
@entity1 also must weigh that thirst for forceful action against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the @entity23 into a country that has been torn apart by an intractable internal conflict @entity1 will be a rather scarce commodity at the @entity6 in the coming weeks			2
he plans to travel to @entity87 , @entity88 , on tuesday to address the 96th national convention of the @entity144 , before stops in @entity90 and @entity91 on friday to raise money for @entity94 candidates ahead of the november midterm elections			0
travel to @entity150 followed by attendance at a @entity153 summit in @entity154 begins immediately after @entity155			0
the trip is expected to focus on @entity23 and @entity158 concerns over tensions between @entity160 and eastern @entity161 .			0

spent two weeks golfing and spending time with his family
critics *lambasted* the president for images of him on the golf course
@entity6 shot back : ' just because the president is in a different location does n't mean he 's not doing his job '
