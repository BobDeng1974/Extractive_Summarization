shoppers could soon be automatically recognised when they walk into a shop using a controversial new camera			1
called @entity4 , the camera uses photos uploaded to @entity6 to recognise people as they walk in			1
shoppers who agree to use the system , which has not been developed with @entity6 , will be offered special deals			1
' @entity6 check - ins are a powerful mechanism for businesses to deliver discounts to loyal customers , yet few businesses — and fewer customers — have realized it , ' said @entity31 - based advertising agency @entity29			1
they are already trialling the scheme in firms close to their office			2
' a search for businesses with active deals in our area turned up a measly six offers			2
' the odds we ’ll ever be at one of those six spots are low ( a strip club and photography studio among them ) , and the incentives for a check - in are not nearly enticing enough for us to take the time			2
' so we set out to evolve the check - in and sweeten the deal , making both irresistible			0
' we call it facedeals			0
' the @entity55 camera can identify faces when people walk in by comparing @entity6 pictures of people who have signed up to the service @entity6 recently hit the headlines when it bought @entity62 , an @entity64 firm that pioneered the use of face recognition technology online			0
the social networking giant uses the software to recognise people in uploaded pictures , allowing it to accurately spot friends			0
the software uses a complex algorithm to find the correct person from their @entity6 pictures the @entity6 camera requires people to have authorised the @entity80 app through their @entity6 account			0

the system then learns what a user looks like as more pictures are approved			1
this data is then used to identify you in the real world			0
in a demonstration video , the firm behind the camera showed it being used to offer free drinks to customers if they signed up to the system .			1

could be used by shops to offer discounts to customers
