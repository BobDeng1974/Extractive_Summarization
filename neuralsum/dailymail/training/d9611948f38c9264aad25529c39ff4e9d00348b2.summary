by @entity0 grubby : @entity2 's needle in @entity3 , @entity4 , which is to be cleaned by laser to eradicate more than 130 years of accumulated grime conservationists will use lasers to clean more than a century 's worth of @entity4 grime from @entity11			1
the project to restore the ancient @entity14 monument , which towers above the east side of @entity3 , will also fix sections that have become weak with age			1
the hieroglyph - inscribed granite pillar , also known as the @entity20 , has stood in the city for more than 130 years			0
it has n't been cleaned since its arrival from @entity14			2
the plan to restore the 3,500 - year - old @entity11 was announced yesterday by the @entity25			0
the non-profit , which manages @entity3 , said tests showed that cleaning with lasers proved to be the most environmentally friendly method , and also the most sensitive to the fragile stone			1
it is understood that the heat from the lasers will vaporise the filth that has accumulated on the @entity20 over the decades it has stood in the heart of the busy , polluted city			0
with 2,112 square - feet of surface area to clean , it is a considerable job			0
the project began this month and is expected to take several months to finish			1
alongside the cleaning job , conservationists will also work to stabilise sections of the obelisk that have become weakened over the ages			1
after conducting the first comprehensive survey of the monument 's surface in its history , they will use glue to make sure that it will be able to weather the next couple of thousand years			1
brought to @entity4 in 1881 , @entity2 's needle is without a doubt the city 's most - ancient structure			2
despite its name , the @entity2 of renown had nothing to do with its creation and , in fact , it predates that legendary @entity14 queen by more than a thousand years			0
it is one of two obelisks carved by stonemasons out of single lumps of red granite about 3,500 years ago in the ancient @entity14 city of @entity73			0
both @entity4 's @entity20 , and its twin , which sits by the @entity75 on @entity77 's @entity76 , are inscribed with hieroglyphics praising the @entity79 , who reigned from 1479 to @entity81			0
it is believed that the pair were originally erected outside a temple , but were then toppled and burned by invading @entity85 rampaging through @entity14 in @entity86			0
they lay buried in the sands of the @entity89 for more than five centuries before roman emperor @entity91 discovered them and transported them to @entity94 , where they were re-erected in a temple built in his honour by @entity2			0
through the ages : the obelisk is shown on the left in a photograph taken in 1881 , just months after it was erected in @entity4 's @entity3			1
it is without a doubt the young city 's most - ancient structure there they stood until the late - 19th century when , during a surge in interest in @entity14 antiquities , the country 's government offered one to @entity114 and the second to the @entity116 in a massive undertaking , a cargo vessel , the @entity117 , was built in an @entity121 shipyard especially for the job of transporting @entity116 's needle across the @entity124 , a journey of a month			2
then , once it arrived at @entity128 's docks , a railway was built especially for the task of transporting it to its new position at the heart of the city			0
it was finally erected in @entity3 on january 22 , 1881 , with a full @entity136 ceremony that was watched by thousands of @entity4			1
@entity3 : the restoration of @entity2 's needle was announced by the @entity25 @entity139 : @entity2 's needle on the @entity76 in @entity141 , central @entity77 the @entity25 has called the restoration of @entity11 ' the most comprehensive conservation of the monument in nearly 130 years '			1
in a release , it said : ' the conservation project was developed by the @entity25 with assistance from the @entity148 and the @entity149			2
' planning the project began in 2011 and included photographing and scanning the @entity20 to document its condition , as well as a comprehensive survey of the monument ’s surface , the first in its history			1
' @entity157 also included testing various methods of cleaning the @entity20 ; cleaning with lasers proved to be the method most sensitive to the stone and most environmentally friendly			0
' egyptologists from the @entity148 believe that fragile areas discovered on the monument ’s surface are the likely result of environmental stresses that occurred more than one thousand years ago , as well as natural weathering			2
' after they are cleaned , these areas will be treated with adhesive products typically used to conserve granite			0
' the conservation work is expected to be complete by autumn .			1
