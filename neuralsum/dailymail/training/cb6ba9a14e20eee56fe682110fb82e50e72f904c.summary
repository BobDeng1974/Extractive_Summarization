as the birth of the @entity4 royal twins draws closer , princess @entity1 's father has told of his and wife @entity6 's excitement at the impending arrival			1
@entity8 , father of 36 - year - old @entity10 beauty , described the feeling as ' amazing ' - and has even temporarily moved to @entity4 to be close to their daughter			1
speaking to @entity16 publication @entity14 , mr @entity8 revealed that it has been a busy year for the @entity18 as he and his wife have celebrated the birth of two grandchildren already			1
the proud father has moved to @entity4 to be closer to his daughter as she prepares to become a mother for the first ( and second ) time next month ' our son @entity34 , who lives in @entity10 , is the father of a 10 - month - old child and yesterday it was the first birthday of our granddaughter , ' he said			1
' now there are two others about to be born , as you know ! it 's amazing ! our grandchildren come fast and furious			1
' but to the @entity10 also revealed that he is determined to treat all of his grandchildren equally - whether they have royal blood or not			1
' i will respect everything required by the protocol , my daughter knows that , but other than that they will be treated in the same way as their cousins			0
' princess @entity1 showed off her baby bump alongside @entity58 at the @entity59 in @entity60 last month @entity8 , pictured above left with his @entity1 and above right with wife @entity6 on their daughter 's wedding day , described the impending birth as ' amazing ' ' i have already opened a savings account for their futures and my daughter 's children will also have their own , with the same amount in			1
' they certainly do not lack funds but i will treat them equally			2
' @entity58 has two children from previous relationships - daughter @entity73 , 22 , and son @entity74 , 10 - but neither are able to inherit the throne			2
the princess recently spoke of her elation at the idea of becoming a mother			2
describing the experience as ' magical '			0
she told @entity16 publication @entity83 , ' the prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical , so powerful			0
we are full of love , gratitude , as well as a great sense of responsibility			0
' i am particularly grateful for the spontaneous love bestowed on me in these special moments			0
the show of affection for my family , of the totality of the @entity4 people and all our friends			0
' after and before : the princess at seven months pregnant ( left ) and in april before announcing that she was expecting ( right ) the royal couple announced they were expecting in may but the news that the former @entity106 swimmer had twins on the way was unofficially broken on @entity109 a week later by a friend of the princess 's father			1
@entity10 tv presenter @entity113 , a friend of @entity8 , tweeted : ' my old @entity115 schoolmate @entity8 has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins			1
congrats @entity1 and @entity58 ! ' the official announcement of the twins was only made last month , with the @entity122 releasing a statement that read : ' the prince and @entity125 are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year			1
' with an average of 3.5 sets of twins born per 1,000 pregnancies , an instant family of two babies - even royal ones - is n't unusual			1
@entity136 , @entity124 is one royal parent of twins , who with wife princess @entity138 welcomed @entity139 and @entity140 in 2013			1
another is crown prince frederik of denmark and his wife @entity143 , who became parents to prince @entity146 and princess @entity147 in 2011			2
prince @entity148 , @entity149 is yet another royal father of twins , following the birth of @entity152 , @entity153 and prince @entity154 , @entity156 , to his wife @entity157 in 2010			1
but although royal twins are fairly frequent among @entity160 dynasties , among them the @entity4 couple , @entity162 royals are an entirely different story with just one set born in the last 2,000 years			0
born to @entity168 of @entity169 and his wife @entity170 in 1430 , @entity166 and @entity167 were the first and only twins born to @entity162 royal parents			2
tragically though , @entity166 , the eldest of the two , died before reaching one - with his younger brother later taking the throne of @entity169 as @entity176 during his marriage to @entity143 , @entity167 sired no fewer than seven children , all of them in separate pregnancies			0
despite the lack of @entity162 royal twins , odds have shortened on another double birth - for the @entity149 and @entity186 - taking place			2
while the @entity4 rules of succession are clear , the @entity162 rules are n't set in stone , although as the new baby - or babies - will be spares , the question of who inherits what is less vexed			0
in theory , with @entity198 already in the royal nursery , the new babies would come behind him with the elder becoming the spare while the younger would have no real role			0
as for which parent is responsible for the @entity4 royal twins - or the @entity162 ones , should they come to pass , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity205 says both could be behind a multiple birth , although the mother is the more likely candidate			2
‘ twins are not genetically based , ' he explains			0
' @entity214 twins are more rare and when a single fertilised egg divides in two , creating identical twins			0
‘ another way is when a mother release two eggs at ovulation and both are fertilised , creating non identical twins			0
‘ if either the mother or the father have twins in their family , the chances of them having twins is higher			0
