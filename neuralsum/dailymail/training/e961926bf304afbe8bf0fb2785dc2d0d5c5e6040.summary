by @entity0 published : 16:44 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 19 january 2013 vibrant graffiti and frescoes uncovered during a restoration of the @entity4 in @entity5 have revealed the arena , famed for its bloody gladiator battles , was a far more colourful place than had previously been thought			1
traces of red , black , green and blue frescoes , as well as graffiti and drawings of phallic symbols , were found in the 1st century building 's only intact internal passageway which sits between the second and third levels			1
the findings paint an all together different appearance than the monochrome grey and red brick that archeologists had previously imagined for the famous 50,000 - seat amphitheatre			1
find : brightly coloured fragments of frescoes were found during a restoration of a passageway inside the @entity4 a restorer stands in front a wall with remains of frescoes and graffiti the findings were part of a long - delayed restoration of @entity5 's @entity4 they show that while the exposed seating area was covered in white marble , the insides , the galleries , all the corridors and transverse hallways were completely colored			1
huge amounts of calcified rock and dirt had hidden the frescoes , which were finally revealed during the cleaning and restoration project , which began in november			1
among the finds was a red palm frond and a picture of a crown believed to have been drawn by a gladiator fan as he or she passed through the passageway			1
another restored section has images of a phallus , which officials said was commonly drawn for good luck			2
the @entity62 word ' @entity63 ' , referring to victory or revenge , was also found			2
@entity4 director @entity66 said less than one per cent of the painted surfaces of the @entity4 remain			1
she said : ' we need to imagine a building with extreme contrasts of color			2
' many of the splashes of color are covered with layers of more recent graffiti			2
" @entity81 " signed his name there with the date 1943			2
" @entity83 " and " @entity82 " did as well			2
someone else left some drawings in 1620			1
' the ancient graffiti , seen here in red in the background , was another discovery of the restoration the frescoes were hidden under decades of calcified rock and grime , and were revealed after the surfaces were cleaned archaeologist @entity96 shows brightly coloured fragments of frescoes inside a corridor of the @entity4 officials say the scrawlings probably date from the 3rd century , after the @entity4 was restored following a fire in a.d. 217			1
but some may be even earlier			2
the passageway , which will be open to the public later on this year , leads to the highest level of seating - a wooden gallery reserved for the lowest classes and furthest from the action in the arena			0
it was built between 72 and 80 ad and was originally used for gladiator contests , and re-enacting sea battles			0
it was the largest ever built in the @entity115 , and was constructed of concrete and stone			0
in its heyday it could seat 50,000 spectators on three tiers of seating			0
the building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era			0
it was then used for a variety of purposes , including housing and and a @entity131 shrine			0
the exterior of the building is visited by millions of tourists each year			0
' we 're used to thinking that during excavations , archaeological surprises are a risk for builders and for the city 's development , ' said @entity5 archaeological heritage superintendent @entity142			0
' this is a beautiful archaeological surprise even in a monument as well known as this one , studied all over the world , there are still new things to discover			0
' aside from the hallway cleaning , the @entity4 is set to undergo â‚¬ 25 million ( $ 33.31 million ) head - to - toe restoration funded by @entity152 businessman @entity151 , founder of the @entity154 's shoe empire			1
the effort is primarily designed to shore up the monument , one of the world 's most famous , which is crumbling under years of neglect			0
asked how such details could have gone undetected for nearly 2,000 years , officials said flatly : money			0
there simply was n't funding available to carry out the restoration of the passageway , which @entity66 said had been a goal for her office for 20 years			0
pieces of masonry and rock have fallen from the rafters , and the travertine is covered in gray dirt from car exhaust and pollution			1
a frescoe reading ' vind ' was found - it means victory or revenge the traces confirmed that while the @entity4 today is a fairly monochrome colour , it used to have halls decked in colour the nearby subway rattles its foundations , such that the @entity4 has begun sinking in the same way the @entity188 does , with a 40 - centimeter ( nearly 16 - inch ) inclination on its south side			1
' it 's not serious , but it needs to be restored , ' @entity66 said , noting the last major restoration was carried out in the 1970s			0
' the later you start , the worse it is			0
' work has been delayed because of court challenges to the contract bidding process , with the latest hearing this week put off until the end of the month			0
while intriguing , none of the fragments restored so far rival the gorgeous frescoes found in other nearby ruins of the @entity205 , such as the 6th century biblical scenes in the @entity208 church			1
but officials stressed that they are nevertheless remarkable because they give a very different impression of what the @entity4 must have looked like in its heyday .			1
