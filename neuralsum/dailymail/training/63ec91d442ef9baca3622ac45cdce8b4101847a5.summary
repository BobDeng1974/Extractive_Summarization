most patients are scared to complain about poor treatment because they fear that they will be ‘ branded troublemakers ’ by the @entity3			1
some are even denied treatment after raising concerns , the new patients ’ watchdog @entity4 has found , while others are labelled ‘ serial complainers ’			1
despite concerted efforts to make the @entity3 more open when things go wrong , healthwatch has discovered that a pervasive ‘ culture of fear ’ means many patients are still petrified to make complaints			1
healthwatch chief executive @entity17 warned a total overhaul of @entity3 complaints procedure was needed the watchdog , which is the official voice of the patient in the @entity3 and social care , will present a 50 - page report to @entity25 this week outlining its concerns and setting out a series of recommendations			1
last night , chief executive @entity17 warned a total overhaul of the @entity3 complaints procedure was needed , saying : ‘ this is not just about tweaking with the system			1
‘ patients experience fear in relation to making complaints and too often providers of health and social care are defensive and not listening properly			1
it a very negative experience for everyone			0
’ miss @entity17 said many hospitals , surgeries , mental health trusts and care home providers still denied patients information and forced them to pursue litigation when many did not want to			2
as part of its research , the organisation conducted a survey of more than 400 people			1
it found that : one respondent , who had cataracts , claimed to have been denied further treatment at a hospital after complaining about being fitted with the wrong eye lens			2
he said : ‘ a surgeon wrote to my gp saying , “ because this gentleman has made a complaint , we feel that it would be better served if he was seen elsewhere			0
” ’ the father - of - four believed the hospital had ‘ turned its back ’ on him as a result of his complaint			0
another respondent , who suffered seizures after a routine hernia operation , was dubbed a ‘ serial complainer ’ when she raised the problem			0
neither patient wanted to be named for fear of angering their doctors further			2
miss @entity17 added : ‘ people are being branded troublemakers and experiencing ongoing problems with their care as a result of complaining			1
‘ the troubling thing about the case studies that we found is that , quite clearly , there is a reason to be scared			0
very often , people walk away [ from complaining ] because they know that – even if one period of treatment is complete – they are bound to need the services of the same people again			1
’ sir @entity98 , who led the public inquiry , concluded that a poor complaints system ‘ allows unacceptable practice to persist ’ she said improvements had been made to the complaints system since spring last year , when the report into the appalling care suffered by thousands at @entity107 was published			0
hundreds are thought to have died unnecessarily at the @entity110 hospital during the previous decade			0
sir @entity98 , who led the public inquiry , concluded that a poor complaints system ‘ allows unacceptable practice to persist ’ , ‘ aggravates the grievance ’ felt by the patient and ‘ undermines the public ’s trust in the service ’			0
a @entity119 spokesman claimed the @entity120 had been ‘ a turning point for the @entity3 ’ and the @entity121 was ‘ now more transparent than ever before ’			2
she added : ‘ feedback is essential so mistakes are not repeated			0
the @entity124 now includes complaints - handling as part of their independent new inspection regime			0

watchdog healthwatch is official voice of the patient in @entity3 and social care
six in ten people say nothing because of worry it will **affect** treatment
healthwatch conducted a survey of more than 400 people
six in ten people do not complain because they are worried it will *adversely* **affect** their treatment
of those who did complain , a third said doing so actually **affect**ed the care they received
people are most *reluctant* to complain about senior figures such as surgeons and *psychiatrists* .
