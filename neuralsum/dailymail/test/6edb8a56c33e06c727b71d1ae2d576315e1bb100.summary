as @entity1 comes to a close , a new damning report has named and shamed some of the worst clothing brands sold in @entity5 and their companies , for the ongoing exploitation of their overseas workers			1
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and the @entity13 - which includes @entity13 , @entity13 and @entity14 - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by @entity17			1
amongst the best performers were @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
the report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in @entity5			2
the @entity17 has named and shamed some of the worst @entity5 clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers amongst the best performers were @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 it found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing			1
none of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage			0
unlike a country 's legally set minimum wage , a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food , water , electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants			0
in some countries like @entity57 , where the minimum wage is as little as us $ 68 a month and a living wage is us $ 104 , the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t - shirt			0
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and the @entity13 - which includes @entity13 , @entity13 and @entity14 - were identified as some of the worst performers ' the whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies do n't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you ca n't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain , ' @entity65 , an advocacy manager at @entity66 , said ' a mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum , and even then , only for part of their supply chain , ' the report states			1
' furthermore , 91 per cent of companies still do n't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent do n't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs			1
' if companies do n't know how and where their products are made , then there 's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected			2
' @entity104 for instance , the world 's fifth largest exporter of cotton , was notorious for its child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour ' on a systematic basis '			0
' furthermore , 91 per cent of companies still do n't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent do n't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs , ' the report stated @entity65 , an advocacy manager at @entity66 told @entity120 that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world 's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry			1
' the whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies do n't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you ca n't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain , ' he said			0
' there were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations			0
' we found all the public information available on the companies - public statements , anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed			0
the report comes almost two years after over 1,100 @entity57 garment workers died when the @entity160 factory collapsed in @entity57 due to building safety problems ' we found all the public information available on the companies - public statements , anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed			2
' the worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they 're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they have n't engaged with our research process			2
about 75 per cent did engage , but one quarter did n't			0
' however the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like @entity186 and @entity187 on improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers , and @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity192 and the @entity193 showing attempts to improve their international worker 's pay .			1

@entity17 *revealed* the @entity5 - sold brands and companies that *ignore* the exploitation of their overseas workers
@entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and the @entity13 - which includes @entity13 , @entity13 and @entity14 - were some of the worst performers
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 had some of the best scores
75 per cent of companies do n't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs
