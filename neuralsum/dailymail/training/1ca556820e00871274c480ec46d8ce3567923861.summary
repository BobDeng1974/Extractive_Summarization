by @entity0 published : 11:43 est , 4 february 2014 @entity2 : 12:54 est , 4 february 2014 given the amount of hours that are wasted playing games on phones and tablets , it was only a matter of time before someone put all this game play to good use			0
@entity13 has teamed up with agency @entity14 to develop a game that will help scientists research faulty genes			1
called play to @entity19 : genes in @entity21 , the game is similar to @entity22 , and as players navigate through the on - screen asteroids they are helping to create new genetic patterns			1
@entity13 teamed up with agency @entity14 to develop a game to help scientists research faulty genes			1
called play to @entity19 : genes in @entity21 , pictured , the game is similar to @entity22 , and as players navigate through the on - screen asteroids they create new genetic patterns a computer app for gps that tells them their patient might have cancer could save hundreds of lives a year			1
the app , created by the @entity38 medical school , costs £ 50 per surgery and can help doctors diagnose some of the deadliest forms of the disease far more quickly			0
the app works by recording patients ’ symptoms whenever they visit the surgery even if they see a different doctor or nurse and turn up out - of - hours			0
if a patient has a number of symptoms which could be cancer – but might otherwise be dismissed as harmless – a message flashes up on the doctor ’s screen			2
researchers believe it could enable up to 3,000 more cases of cancer to be detected sooner leading to 300 lives saved annually due to earlier treatment			0
to create the game , @entity13 collected over two million pieces of data from 2,000 breast cancer patients in the @entity64 and @entity65			1
travelling in a world set 800 years in the future , players guide a spaceship safely through an intergalactic assault course , gathering along the way a fictional cargo called @entity73			1
each route that gamers choose to fly the spaceship , and each piece of @entity73 collected , uses data taken from these cancer patients ' genes to create a new genetic pattern			1
every time the game is played , these patterns are fed back to scientists who can detect hot spots in faulty genes within these patterns that could be targeted with new treatments			1
this in turn should help them develop new drugs that target specific genetic faults , and new ways to figure out how to stop cancer developing in the first place			1
the researchers created the game because there was too much data for a scientists to sift through manually			2
to create the game , @entity13 collected two million pieces of data from 2,000 @entity64 and @entity65 breast cancer patients			1
the game is set 800 years in the future and players have to gather a fictional precious cargo called @entity73 along the way each route that gamers choose to fly the spaceship , pictured , uses data collected from cancer patients ' genes to create a new genetic pattern			1
every time the game is played , these patterns are fed back to scientists who can detect hot spots in faulty genes within these patterns the free game , available on @entity123 and @entity124 , has already been downloaded 1,700 times			1
the more people that play the game , the more accurate the results , and once 10,000 people have downloaded and played the game , scientists will start to analyse the data			2
all the information will be fed back to a cancer research laboratory at @entity133			0
@entity134 , from @entity13 , said : ' our world - first smartphone game is simply out of this world			0
‘ not only is it great fun to play - but every single second gamers spend directly helps our work to bring forward the day all cancers are cured			0

all the information will be fed back to a cancer research laboratory at @entity133 ' our scientists ' research produces colossal amounts of data , some of which can only be analysed by the human eye - a process which can take years			2
' we hope thousands of people worldwide will play the game as often as possible , to help our researchers get through this data			0
' if the game is successful , it could be used to look at data for other types of cancer such as prostate and lung cancer			0
' @entity174 comedian @entity173 , who launched the game in @entity175 , said : ' teenagers will now be able to turn to their parents and say ' i am curing cancer as opposed to wasting my time playing games			0
' it 's fantastic , we could n't have done this 10 years ago			0
this technique of using crowd - sourcing to look at huge amounts of data is a new science			0
' scientists generally use computer software to trawl through large amounts of data generated by microarrays , yet but in many cases these are not accurate enough .			0

play to @entity19 : genes in @entity21 was created by @entity13
the *charity* collected two million pieces of data from 2,000 cancer patients
players guide a spaceship across the screen collecting cargo
each route that gamers take collects gene data to create genetic patterns
these patterns are sent to scientists who use them to detect faulty genes
this can help develop new drugs that target these faults , and stop cancer
