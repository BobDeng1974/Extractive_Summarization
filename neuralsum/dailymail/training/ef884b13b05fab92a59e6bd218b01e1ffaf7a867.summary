to whom does this @entity0 belong ? it is said that after a while dogs begin to resemble their owners ... so can you figure out to which celebrities these cute pups belong ? mother - of - two @entity8 , stylist @entity9 , and models @entity10 and @entity12 are just some of the stars who let legendary @entity15 - based dog photographer @entity14 pap their pet as part of a new exhibition to raise money for animal charity @entity20			1
producer @entity21 , @entity23 bassist @entity22 , model @entity24 , designer @entity26 , former guitarist with @entity27 and @entity29 ' @entity28 also took their dogs into the studio to have their turn in front of the camera			1
the feeling frontman @entity39 , @entity41 's daughter @entity40 , fashion expert @entity42 , designer @entity43 , actor @entity36 and former @entity38 star @entity37 also had their dogs take part in @entity14 's exhibition @entity48			1
the resulting prints will be auctioned online via pet community @entity50 and be on display for one week only in @entity55 ' @entity54 headquarters			1
discussing the exhibition , @entity14 said : ' filling a gallery with fifty intimate yet oversized portraits of dogs is a dream come true			1
' my aim with the portraits is to capture the seemingly human side of canine emotion as well as those dog - like traits we all recognise			1
' the pictures have been taken from low angles to appear as natural as possible and are almost always focused on the eyes			0
' two labradoodles pose beautifully for @entity14 ... but who takes them home at the end of the shoot ? speaking to @entity76 , he explained why having dogs on set is never going to be boring : ' they rarely do exactly what you want them to and so there is an element of chance to the results			1
' you control the lighting , bring in the dog , and then move the set up around according to the dogs behaviour			1
' he continued : ' they do n't understand subtle direction like models , and the whole shoot often becomes very physical			0
' their unpredictability means that you have to try and create your own luck			0
nothing is guaranteed but then when you do get the shot it is all the more rewarding			1
' a @entity100 terrier named @entity101 , @entity102 the pug and @entity105 the chihuahua all belong to ...			0
this is @entity107 the miniature schnauzer ... but whose house does she live in ? and which celebrity dogs particularly well - behaved ? ' @entity110 and @entity24 's dogs were pretty amazing			1
it was apparent that they spend a lot of time together and the dogs trust them			1
' getting three dogs to sit perfectly in a line is much trickier than it seems but @entity24 managed this very easily			1
' @entity110 was just hilarious			0
she stood behind me with her head above my camera , speaking to the dogs in that amazing way of hers			1
' lots of different intonations to keep the dogs interest as she listed all the things they were interested in - these ranged from the fishes in the sea to the ghosts in their house			1
the dogs were genuinely engaged and i was in stitches			1
' @entity26 's dog was pretty fun too but for different reasons : my own dog @entity141 became obsessed and spent the entire shoot trying to mount the poor little thing			2
in the end we had to lock shut him in the kitchen to cool down			0
' this beautiful @entity149 is called @entity150 - but what 's his owner 's name ? @entity155 the @entity154 belongs to someone who feels very at home with a microphone in his hand ... @entity161 ' reasons for working with @entity55 and @entity20 were simple : ' it was a no brainer really			1
i wanted to do a show with @entity55 and we agreed that it should be for charity			2
' dogs sharing their lives with the rich and famous and dogs yet to be homed have been lit and photographed in the same setting ' ' @entity20 have a policy which states that they never put a healthy dog down			1
this alone made me want to work with them , and after meeting the team i knew we 'd made the right decision			0
' dogs sharing their lives with the rich and famous and dogs yet to be homed have been lit and photographed in the same setting			2
' it is striking that although the animals are physically and socially so diverse they behave in almost exactly the same way			0
' it would be difficult to guess the ones going home with @entity12 and those waiting for a new home - they all crave human love and will all do anything for a piece of cheese			0
' who dressed this dapper little @entity196 @entity195 ? socks the whippet , left , and a stunning salt and pepper miniature @entity197 , right ... but whose are they ? following a private preview , the exhibition - held at @entity205 , 81 @entity206 , @entity207 - will be open to the public from 21 march to 29 march , 10am to 5pm			2
bidding in the online auction opens here today			0
@entity210 , co-founder of @entity211 , said : ' at @entity213 we are passionate supporters of @entity20 and truly admire photographer @entity14 ' work			1
' his portraits wonderfully encapsulate the true character and soul of each of the dogs featured			2
' we are proud to have organised this event to raise money and awareness for dogs in need and also to showcase @entity14 's fabulous work			1
we hope everybody bids for these beautiful portraits			0
' who takes home this happy @entity229 , left , and this serious @entity230 , right ? this wise @entity231 looks like nothing will phase him ... even a rough - and - tumble young family @entity235 , chief executive of @entity20 , said : ' dogs have long been seen as man 's best friend and this exhibition is a shining example of the beauty of our furry friends			1
' it 's hard for us as dog lovers to imagine that there are so many abandoned dogs looking for new homes , and that â€™s where @entity20 comes in			1
' dogs of all shapes and sizes can be found at our network of rehoming centres across the country			2
' we hope that this exhibition will not only help the @entity20 canine stars featured have a chance of a new start , but through the monies raised all of the other dogs that pass through our doors each and every day			1
' at whom is @entity266 the puggle gazing with those big puppy - dog eyes ? peggy the @entity269 is a tiny little thing belonging to ... ? whose floppy - eared @entity270 is toffee ? @entity273 , not the eyes , , , with dogs , is rarely the eyes that depict the personality			1
the eye thing is an old habit picked up photographing @entity280 thing that best shows a dogs personality / mood is the position of the ears			2
getting the ears into a desirable position is key			0
if a dog is slightly wary , which they often are on set , their ears will go down			2
this does n't make for an attractive portrait			0
i will often get an assistant to leave the room and knock on the door to get the ears to prick up			0
this can backfire and send the dog into fits of barking but you work with what you have			2
the shoot is always quite organic in this respect			0
@entity307 treats handy the sitting part is almost always down to food			0
the greedier a dog is the easier it is to photograph			2
my own dog is obsessed with food and will never , ever take his eyes off a biscuit			2
this is the ideal scenario because dogs do n't generally follow objects with their eyes , but will move the entire head			2
this baby long - haired @entity323 is @entity325 ... but who is her owner ? this way they can be manipulated into lifting or lowering their head to the desired position			0
for dogs that are n't interested in food then maybe a squeaky toy			0
absolutely anything that holds their attention can be used - but , to be honest , i have rarely met a dog that wo n't play ball for a piece of cheddar			0
@entity344 , boy i would say get down low			0
lie on the floor for a dogs eye view			0
they look much better shot from low angles			0
@entity351 if you do n't have professional lighting is to simply wear something white			0
if you are close enough to the dog it will reflect light into his / her eyes and can really bring a picture to life			0
