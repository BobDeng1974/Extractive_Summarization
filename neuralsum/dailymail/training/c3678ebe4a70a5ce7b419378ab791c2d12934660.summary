@ @entity10 warned the first account there had been a mistake , and failed to stop the beheading video from being disseminated , the website reported			1
according to the news site , @entity0 then wrote on @entity17 ' a clarification about the mistake was made by " @entity22 " account , that has published the video before the official time			1
' the user saw a tweet with the video and thought it was published officially			0
we tried to remove the video after we understood that his was published by mistake , and we are sorry to the followers of the @entity31			1
' in a later @entity8 message , those responsible apologized and asked fellow jihadis not to ' reproach ' them			0
the group later apologized to its followers retaliation : the fighter who apparently beheads @entity6 in the video calls it retribution for @entity46 's continued airstrikes against the group the video footage - depicting what the @entity49 called a sickening act of brutality - was posted two weeks after the release of video showing the killing of @entity56 and just days after @entity6 's mother pleaded for his life			1
in the video , the man who appears to be @entity6 says ' i am @entity62			2
i 'm sure you know exactly who i am by now and why i am appearing before you			0
and now this time for my message : ' @entity46 , your foreign policy of intervention in @entity70 was supposed to be for the preservation of @entity49 lives and interest			1
so why is it that i ’m having to pay the price of your interference with my life ? am i not an @entity49 citizen ? ' you ’ve spent billions of @entity49 taxpayers dollars and we ’ve lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the @entity31			1
so where is the @entity49 people ’s interest in reigniting this war ? from what little i know about foreign policy i remember a time when you can not win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from @entity70 and @entity93 and to close down @entity94			2
' here you are now @entity46 nearing the end of your term and having achieved none of the above and seemingly marching us the @entity49 people into a blazing fire			0
' @entity102 , a spokesman for the family , said that the @entity104 had seen the video but that authorities have not established its authenticity			0
' the family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately			0
there will be no public comment from the family during this difficult time , ' @entity102 said			0
@entity6 , a 31 - year - old @entity112 - area native who freelanced for @entity114 and @entity115 magazines , vanished in @entity116 in august 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed @entity56 's beheading			1
dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid @entity116 landscape , @entity6 was threatened in that video with death unless the @entity49 stopped airstrikes on the @entity31			1
in the video distributed tuesday and titled ' a second message to @entity49 , ' @entity6 appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the @entity31 , the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across @entity116 and @entity70 and declared itself a caliphate			1
in @entity135 , @entity134 spokeswoman @entity133 said @entity49 intelligence analysts will work as quickly as possible to determine if the video is authentic			2

' our hearts go out to the @entity6 family			0
' @entity133 said it is believed that ' a few ' @entity49 are still being held by the @entity31			1
@entity133 would not give any specifics , but one is a 26 - year - old woman kidnapped while doing humanitarian aid work in @entity116 , according to a family representative who asked that the hostage not be identified out of fear for her safety			2
the fighter who apparently beheads @entity6 in the video calls it retribution for @entity46 's continued airstrikes against the group			1
' i 'm back , @entity46 , and i 'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the @entity31 ... despite our serious warnings , ' the fighter says			0
' so just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people			0
' the killer specifically mentions the recent @entity49 airstrikes around the @entity172 dam and the beleaguered @entity70 town of @entity174 , making it unlikely that @entity6 was killed at the same time as @entity56 , as some analysts had speculated			1
over the weekend , @entity70 government forces with help from @entity49 airstrikes broke the @entity31 's two - month siege of @entity174 , a town where some 15,000 @entity182 had been stranded			1

the @entity199 , a @entity49 terrorism watchdog , first reported the video 's existence			2
the @entity31 has terrorized rivals and civilians alike with widely publicized brutality as it seeks to expand a proto - state it has carved out on both sides of the border			2
in its rise to prominence over the past year , it has frequently published graphic photos and gruesome videos of bombings , beheadings and mass killings			0
