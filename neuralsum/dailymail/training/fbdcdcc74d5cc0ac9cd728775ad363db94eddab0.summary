@entity0 prepared for the @entity2 run - in by admitting that he does not have a reliable centre forward			2
@entity4 face @entity5 at @entity6 on saturday at the start of a 12 - game run that will decide whether they make the @entity11 places and whether @entity13 ’s first season at the club can be considered a success			1
with @entity4 ’s defence one of the tightest in the @entity2 , @entity13 knows that goals at the other end could decide his team ’s fate and agreed that his centre - forward trio of @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 have not reached the required levels this season			1
@entity0 claims he does not have a reliable centre forward for his @entity11 chasing side the @entity4 manager said : ‘ it is true because i can not deny it , @entity24 can not deny it , @entity22 can not deny it and @entity23 is not playing there much any more , but we can not deny that at this moment we do n’t have a striker who scores 20 goals in the season			1
‘ they could be having an unlucky year and i have to take that into account and i have to decide , with my staff , if it ’s these aspects or other aspects that is causing this			0
’ despite the injury problems that have caused @entity4 so many problems defensively this season , it is the attacking play of @entity13 ’s team that is causing supporters to be concerned			1
@entity13 claims his side are short of a 20 - goal a season striker as they prepare for their weekend game @entity23 and @entity59 share a joke in training at the @entity62 in @entity63 currently , they see little of the fluency and excitement traditionally associated with @entity4 despite the investment in attacking players made last summer			1
@entity22 is likely to get a chance with @entity23 on saturday , as @entity70 is out for a few weeks with an ankle problem and young @entity72 has a dead leg			2
@entity13 also admitted that he needs to see more from record signing @entity75 and conceded that the former @entity77 player is struggling to adapt to what his manager wants			2
‘ he needs to go through the process and at the end he shall be much better , ’ said @entity13			2
‘ i know that he is a very creative player and you can see this from the statistics			0
@entity75 and @entity23 are put through their paces as @entity4 training gets underway @entity13 has conceded that summer signing @entity89 is struggling to adapt to what his manager wants ‘ he needs that space and i give him that space , but he needs to do things with his brain and that is a learning process , not only with @entity89 but with all the players			1
' every team has its philosophy , which is why some players are better with one club but not another			0
when you buy players you need to give them time to adapt to the culture of @entity106 , to the rhythm of the @entity2 , because that is a big difference to somewhere like @entity109			0
’ an under pressure @entity22 is put through his paces as @entity4 train ahead of @entity5 asked if trying to change the way a player like @entity89 thinks risks damaging him , @entity13 was unwavering			1
‘ you have to ask the player that , ’ he said			0
‘ i give a lot of space to all the players because in an attacking way they create more when they are free			0
' but when you want to win as a team you have to defend also and he has to do that			0
it is not always the fault of the manager when a player is not performing well , i can tell you ! ’ @entity129 and @entity130 are put through their paces as the @entity4 duo look to @entity5			0
