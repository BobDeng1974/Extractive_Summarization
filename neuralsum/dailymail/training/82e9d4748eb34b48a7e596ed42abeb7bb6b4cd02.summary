in the interview with the @entity10 , she added : ‘ the @entity1 ’s image was that they care for animals , prevent cruelty and help and advise people with animals			1
i was horrified when i learned we were going to have to put down healthy animals because we did n’t have room for them			0

' the response of the charity to the @entity10 's piece about @entity109 was disgraceful			2
