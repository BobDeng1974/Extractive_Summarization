the @entity4 extremists running roughshod across @entity1 could produce ' a thousand ' global terrorists like @entity6 bent on widespread death and destruction , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity2 warned on monday			1
@entity9 said that if the @entity2 and other nations focus too much on @entity1 's internal politics and ignore the ' immediate threat ' of a terrorist movement that 's gathering steam , the results will be catastrophic			1
' this is a global tumor in @entity1 taking place now and in @entity18 , ' he said , referring to the @entity4 militant group calling itself the @entity20 in @entity1 and @entity18 ( @entity21 )			1
' we 've seen it before			0
' the @entity24 has scolded @entity26 's government in @entity27 for provoking @entity21 by alienating the country 's @entity4 minority			1
@entity30 said on friday that @entity2 military intervention would be conditioned on reconciliation efforts from @entity26 's @entity34 majority			1
' so this should be a wake - up call			0
@entity1 ’s leaders have to demonstrate a willingness to make hard decisions and compromises on behalf of the @entity1 people in order to bring the country together			2
' but @entity9 suggested during an interview with @entity38 's @entity37 that @entity30 is naively fiddling while @entity27 burns			1
' these are all " nice to have " discussions , ' he said , but ' what we have in @entity1 now , to -- is an immediate threat			1
' ' but do you not feel this is an immediate threat ? ' @entity37 interrupted , ' that practically half the country feels disenfranchised ? the @entity4 ? ' ' we 're not saying we 're not happy to [ have a ] discussion , ' he responded			1
' we want to have that discussion			0
but we 're saying conditioning that discussion is not wise			0
making clear that we all stand together against a threat in global terrorism is the question			2
' ' let me give you an example			0
what you have in @entity94 , with one @entity6 – you will have a thousand of them			2
' ' no pows , ' he warned			0
' nothing , none of that			0
no rules of engagement but destruction			2
' ' that 's the situation in @entity1			2
' @entity30 told @entity104 on monday that he is sending 275 armed military men and women into @entity27 to protect @entity2 embassy personnel and assets as they are moved elsewhere in @entity1 and to @entity109			1
they will be ' armed for combat , ' the @entity24 said , while insisting that the ground troops wo n't be the first drop in an ocean of military entanglements of the sort that @entity30 campaigned against in 2008 and 2012			2
an administration official also said monday that the president is considering the deployment of a small contingent of @entity121 to @entity1 , specifically to help the @entity26 government slow the advance of @entity21			1
@entity30 is also mulling unilateral air strikes to hamper @entity21 , but administration sources told @entity126 on tuesday that the primary objection to that strategy is political , not tactical			1
the @entity130 , one source said , is concerned that forcing @entity21 off the battlefield now that neighboring @entity132 has sent 2,000 of its elite @entity134 forces to stabilize the region could effectively clear the way for @entity132 to seize oil fields and other lands in eastern @entity1			1
@entity37 pushed back against @entity139 , arguing that the more ' immediate threat ' to @entity1 was political inequality enforced by @entity34 against @entity4 @entity21 aims to establish a caliphate -- an @entity144 state that transcends national borders -- in areas of @entity18 and @entity1 , and it has captured at least nine cities in the two countries ' a thousand of them ' : @entity9 says the @entity150 ( pictured ) , who masterminded @entity152 's 9/11 terror attacks in the @entity2 , could just be the beginning is @entity21 is allowed to press forward @entity30 is stuck between a rock and a hard place , needing to keep a @entity2 - friendly government in place in @entity27 while also avoiding a newly strengthened and further leveraged @entity132 at a time when that @entity144 republic is moving toward nuclear weapons capability			1
@entity9 said monday that whether or not the @entity24 decides on a path of limited cooperation with @entity163 , @entity1 needs help urgently			2
' we have been saying that we need to strengthen our army with having fighter planes , @entity169 helicopters and others			0
... the administration now understands that urgency			0
they have been willing to say , " we are willing to help			0
" what we are saying is we can not wait until tomorrow			0
a decision has to be made			0
it should have been made yesterday			0
' from our perspective , ' @entity9 said , ' the urgency of the ground are giving us less options and more radical options			0

@entity185 said monday that while @entity30 frets about @entity1 's internal politics , @entity21 is gathering strength
unless the group is stopped , he said , it will become a global terror threat like ' a thousand ' @entity50
@entity21 will take ' no @entity195 , ' he warned , ' nothing , none of that . no rules of engagement but destruction '
' what we have in @entity1 now ... is an immediate threat , ' the ambassador warned
@entity38 's @entity37 said she thought the true threat was a @entity4 minority that feels ' disenfranchised '
@entity21 , the @entity20 in @entity1 and @entity18 , is a @entity4 militant group that was *previously* known as ' @entity21 '
