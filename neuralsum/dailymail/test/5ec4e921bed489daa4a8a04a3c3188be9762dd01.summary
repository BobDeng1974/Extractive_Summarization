the superstitious will know – or perhaps those who have seen @entity3 's classic film @entity4 – that a bird in the house is a bad omen and one that is said to equate to death			0
so a family in @entity10 would be forgiven for being slightly put out about the fact that their home became infested with them			2
according to the video maker , who returns home with the other people in the clip to find the infestation , the birds came in through the chimney			1
the video maker stated that he initially thought the intruders were bats but now believes them to be sparrows capturing them on camera as they fly around the room , the man remains very calm while narrating on the carnage before him – birds crashing into the walls and flying overhead			1
he says : ‘ there are birds everywhere , what the hell , look at this , ’ before reiterating his point and recoiling as one crashes into him			0
a female voice then speaks out – also extremely calmly considering the fact the front room has been turned into an aviary			0
despite the infestation of birds in their front room , the family remain very calm throughout the video according to the video maker the birds managed to invade the house through the chimney the lady says : ‘ careful not to step on them , ’ as the video maker points out that some of the birds appear to be dying , as they lie on the ground			1
the filmmaker then states : ‘ this is awful , ’ and suggests that the group need to find a way to get the birds out of the house			0
the video concludes with the filmmaker continuing to record the birds as they circle the room and bounce off the walls			2
the video maker states that the scene is awful as a number of birds crash into the walls and end up on the floor according to the video maker there were around 30 birds in the front room when the group came home			1
speaking on another video , he also states that he initially thought they were bats before realising they were birds and potentially sparrows .			0
