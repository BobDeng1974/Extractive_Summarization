@entity0 survived a wayward tee - shot on the final hole to win his third @entity4 title at the @entity5 at @entity6 in @entity7			1
@entity0 finished 17 under par and won by one stroke from @entity10 after @entity12 's @entity11 , whose seven successive birdies on the front nine was the longest streak of the tour season , faded on the inward half			1
but the 37 - year - old @entity17 had to do it the hard way after hitting a tree with his final drive , forcing him to hack out left - handed			2
@entity0 celebrates after holey his bogey putt on the 18th to win the @entity5 at @entity6 @entity0 is met by his family on the 18th green after three shot turn around in the final round two good shots set up a tap - in bogey and his compatriot @entity31 could do no better , having left his own tee - shot up against the face of a bunker			1
@entity0 's win at the @entity36 course is his third career @entity4 title and his first victory in four years @entity0 's five - under - par round of 66 was blemish - free up until that point , with four birdies on the front nine taking him firmly into contention having started three strokes behind overnight leader @entity45			1
he then pitched to two feet to set up birdie on the par - five 13th and saw a wonderful approach at 15 roll just past the right of the hole and a foot through - bringing him another birdie - and even his struggles down the last could not prevent him clinching the title			0
@entity0 told @entity53 : ' i was behind a little bit but i kept hitting good shots and giving myself chances			2
' obviously @entity11 must have made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch but i just kept hitting fairways and hitting good irons			2
' the 13th was the momentum turner - @entity10 's in the fairway and i fan mine out right , but i end up making birdie and he makes bogey			0
' he had no regrets over not playing safe at the last			0
he said : ' that 's driver all day for me , i 've got 290 ( yards ) to carry to take out the bunker			0
i just pulled it slightly too much and got real unlucky ending up next to the base of a tree			0
' a two - under 69 saw @entity31 remain in second , where he started the round , while @entity11 shared third with @entity78			2
@entity0 holds his trophy aloft following his five - under par 66 saw him secure victory @entity0 ( right ) finished one shot clear of @entity10 ( left ) in @entity82 the 24 - year - old @entity11 had moved into the lead after his blistering front nine			1
a solid putt at the sixth earned him his fourth successive birdie and he followed it up with a superb three - wood onto the green at the par - five seventh and well - judged irons to the next two greens			0
@entity11 said : ' i 'm happy with where i finished			0
the back nine on this golf course is very tough and you have to hit perfect shots to make birdies , which i did n't do			1
' @entity99 was fifth on 14 under , @entity98 was a further shot back and @entity45 joined @entity101 at 12 under after a closing 74 featuring three bogeys and a double			0
@entity12 's @entity11 hit seven successive birdies on the front nine , the longest streak of the season			1

@entity0 's two late birdies helped the @entity17 to victory
the result is @entity0 's third career victory on the @entity4
@entity0 came from three shots back at the start of the round
@entity11 could n't *capitalise* on a run of seven *straight* birdies
