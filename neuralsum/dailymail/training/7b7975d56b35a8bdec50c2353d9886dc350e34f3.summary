@entity11 , 29 , and his wife @entity12 , 28 , are determined to tick their way through as much of the list as possible before their time with little @entity18 , who was diagnosed with a rare brain condition , runs out			1

then they whisked her away to be resuscitated and check on her and then she finally came to , ' mr @entity11 told @entity43 of the couple 's first indication that there was a problem			0

the now three - month - old spent her first few weeks of life undergoing blood tests , ultrasounds , @entity54 , a lumber puncture and finally an mri , which led her to be diagnosed with @entity57 6 the couple are determined to spend as much time with their daughter as possible and have begun checking off points on a bucket list of family activities they always imagined themselves doing as a family ' all those cognitive and motor skills on @entity18 are n't there due to that part of the brain being underdeveloped			1
' with this condition @entity18 will never reach any milestones			1
she will never smile , never sit , never support her own head , never eat solids , never talk and the list goes on			1
this condition is aggressive and will shorten baby @entity99 's life to approximately one year			2
' when asked if he could remember how he felt when he was told of his child 's fate , mr @entity11 said : ' i can remember it clear as day - i was just shell shocked			0
' there are no words to describe it			0
our life had just been turned upside down			0
' part of the bucket list included a family holiday to @entity112 , where they took this photo in @entity115 a family trip to @entity118 's @entity117 was also on the list , where they met giraffes and koalas ' we want to take her fishing , camping , get a celebrity photo with @entity127 and @entity128 , pitch up a tent in the backyard , build a cubby house in the lounge room , fall asleep together , have story time - nothing extravagant ' but the family 's heartache does n't stop there , as they must also watch @entity18 suffer through multiple seizures each day			1
' the seizures happen because the parts of the brain that are underdeveloped are trying to send messages , but they 're being shortened and not transmitting			2
if it has n't got the right parts , it wo n't communicate so they have seizures , ' , mr @entity11 said			2
' they happen every time she 's awake and even when she 's asleep , on and off , on and off about 10 or 12 times			2
seeing that it hurts her , that 's when it hurts us			0
' @entity11 and @entity12 also have to help @entity18 through the multiple seizures she endures each day @entity157 as a family : @entity18 's condition is extremely rare , with only 16 cases around the world			1
she is the first ever case in @entity63 the family are now reaching out the public for donations so that they can spend each of @entity18 's remaining days with her			1

' if heaven forbid something happened sooner rather than later – i 'll be regretting [ not spending time with her ] for the rest of my life , ' mr @entity11 said			0
since starting their bucket list , the family have fulfilled a number of checkpoints including a plane trip , going on a family holiday , a visit to the zoo and plenty of pictures along the way			0
' they are all just little things we wanted to do as a family and we now have to cram it in in a short time , ' mr @entity11 said			2
the family are now reaching out the public for donations so that they can spend each of @entity18 's remaining days with her and have so far reached an overwhelming $ 27,000 in support since sharing their story three days ago ' we 're still going through the motions , but this is n't the hard part – it 's the easiest part			1
just her face and her presence is keeping us going , ' mr @entity11 said ' we want to take her fishing , camping , get a celebrity photo with @entity127 and @entity128 , pitch up a tent in the backyard , build a cubby house in the lounge room , fall asleep together , have story time - nothing extravagant			0
' if we can , we want to visit family and friends in other states so that she can meet them too			0
we just have to live out what we can and make the best of what we have			0
' ' to people in similar situations : i would suggest to love your child and make the most of it			0
mourn them afterwards because if time with them is short , you do n't want to be sad while they 're here - it does n't make things any easier			0
