by @entity0 the idea to quit their jobs and buy a school bus started off as a joke			1
but for six @entity7 friends the idea took hold , and five months later they are in the middle of an epic road trip around the @entity11 in a bus they gutted and renovated themselves			1
the young professionals - including a lawyer , a financial advisor and an engineer – started in @entity19 and have since driven through 18 states from the @entity21 to the @entity22 of the @entity11			1
here it is pictured in @entity37 @entity28 , 24 , who worked in @entity38 as a financial advisor before deciding to quit his job and join his friends in @entity19 , said the group got the idea off another guy 's website after he converted a bus into a recreational vehicle			1
' it was pretty much one of those situations where [ friend ] @entity31 [ @entity31 ] brought it up one day - hankboughtabus.com - and we just thought that was really cool , ' mr @entity28 told @entity53			0
at the beginning of the year mr @entity31 , also 24 , had just finished his university degree in @entity56 and was on a working holiday in @entity58 , @entity19			2
he persuaded his friends @entity30 , 24 , @entity27 , 24 , @entity26 , 22 , @entity29 , 21 , and mr @entity28 to quit their various jobs and come join him to work as ski lift operators in @entity58			2
the journey has seen them travel from @entity19 through @entity11 states including @entity37 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( pictured ) , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 the young professionals - including a lawyer , a financial advisor and an engineer - said the idea to buy a bus ' started off as a joke '			1

' it kind of started as a joke , like " how funny would it be if we did this " , ' mr @entity31 said			0
' then it escalated to @entity27 and i looking for buses , then we found a bus , then we bought a bus			2
' it kind of just went from one of those crazy ideas to " we are actually doing this "			0
' their journey has seen them meet some interesting characters – including some elderly people in @entity68 who were preparing for an apocalypse – and they even ran into former @entity7 prime minister @entity113 on the street in @entity115 when they bought the vehicle in @entity91 , @entity19 , it was an iconic yellow school bus but they stripped it and painted it white none of the friends had renovated a bus before but mr @entity27 , a mechanical engineer , did most of the carpentry and @entity26 did the digital design ' we were drinking beers and walking along and she was walking towards us as we crossed the street , ' mr @entity31 said			1
' i was just like " hey @entity130 ! " and she was on the phone but she stopped and excused herself and shook our hands			0
' the group – most of who went to school together in @entity139 , @entity135 - purchased the bus at the end of january			1
it took two and a half months to renovate , during breaks in between skiing in @entity58 , @entity19 , and they worked in temperatures as cold as minus 30 degrees the bus is nicknamed the @entity35 , because the friends lived on @entity148 and they are @entity149 fans it took two and a half months to renovate in temperatures as cold as minus 30 degrees			1
' we did it on our days off while we were n't skiing , ' mr @entity31 said			0
' @entity27 is a pretty handy guy , he 's a mechanical engineer , and he did most of the carpentry			0
' @entity26 has finished an architecture degree so he did the digital design			0
' it was a yellow school bus when they bought it but they stripped everything out			1
after gutting the bus they covered the inside with plywood and insulated it before putting timber floor panels down ' getting rid of the seats was probably the hardest part , it was ridiculously cold because we had to go under the bus to undo the bolts because they were fixed to the bottom			2
' they then covered the inside with plywood and insulated it before putting timber floor panels down			0
the bus is nicknamed the @entity35 , because the friends lived on @entity148 and they are @entity149 fans			1
on april 13 they left @entity19 to drive to @entity178 in @entity69 , and they finished painting it white the day before they left			2
the group of friends - most of who know each other from high school in @entity139 - say the best part of their trip has been the people they have met along the way the friends pictured at an @entity191 museum in @entity192 , @entity74 to get to @entity69 they drove through @entity37 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
after the festival they drove through @entity68 again , then @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
along the way they 've been documenting their journey on their @entity198			0
they park their bus in rv parks and sleep in it on the beds they customised themselves			2
' we try to meet all the families and older people staying in the rv parks , ' mr @entity31 said			0
' everyone has been really nice and looked after us			0
' the best part of the trip has been all the people that we 've met			2
' two of the boys ran into former @entity7 prime minister @entity113 on the street in @entity115 while they were drinking beers the group only has three weeks left on their @entity11 visas , so from @entity81 they will travel to @entity220 and @entity221			1
after that they will split up , with some going back to @entity19 and others returning to jobs in @entity7			1
mr @entity31 said the friends would n't have done anything differently – except for ' maybe buying a bus that had air conditioning '			1
' i would say i guess there was a certain amount of risk , people think " that would be a cool idea to do " but a lot of people would n't have the perseverance or commitment to stick it out			0
' we have a saying – " everything comes up moose " – because for us there 's always a solution			0
' if something seems bad it always works out in the best possible way			0
