@entity0 is apologizing to drag queens and the transgender community for deleting accounts that used drag names like @entity5 rather than legal names such as @entity7			1
the world 's biggest online social network caught heat recently when it deleted several hundred accounts belonging to self - described drag queens , other performers and members of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community			1
@entity0 has long required its users to go by their ' real names ' on the site for security purposes , to stand out from other social networks and so it can better target advertising to people			1
drag queens ( from left ) @entity5 ms @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 spoke of their disappointment earlier this month after @entity0 executives met with them and refused to change the policy banning stage names			1
@entity0 apologized - altough the real names policy is n't changing , the way @entity0 enforces it might now , the company says the spirit of its policy does n't mean a person 's legal name but ' the authentic name they use in real life			1
' though the real names policy is n't changing , the way @entity0 enforces it might			1
last month , the company suggested that performers such as drag queens have other ways of maintaining their stage identities on the site , such as creating pages that are meant for businesses and public figures			2
identity : the performers told a conference at @entity58 city hall the ban ' wipes them out of existence ' @entity29 ( left ) said : ' i have been @entity29 for 20 years , and i have @entity0 telling me @entity29 does not exist			0
so they 're basically wiping you out of existence ' anger : sister @entity28 and @entity29 are two of hundreds whose had profiles have been blocked by the social network but a fan page is not the same as a regular @entity0 account and users were not happy with the suggestion			2
and a group of transvestites in @entity58 claimed it was their human right to identify as their alter - egos			0
supervisor @entity81 , who is representing the drag queens , told a news conference : ' if we 're going to work together on this , we want acknowledgement that this policy is misguided			2
' he was flanked by the movement 's instigator , @entity28 , and fellow cross dressers @entity29 , @entity91 , and @entity5 miss @entity5			0
@entity29 said : ' i have been @entity29 for 20 years , and i have @entity0 telling me @entity29 does not exist			0
so they 're basically wiping you out of existence			0
' @entity0 has long required its users to go by their ' real names ' on the site for security purposes , to stand out from other social networks and so it can better target advertising to people @entity104 , star of @entity106 's @entity105 , condemned the policy as a distraction from other more important issues in the community , telling @entity111 : ' can @entity0 just get this figured out quickly please ? aliases have existed for ages , it should n't be a surprise to anyone ! ' while we squabble over this , we 're wasting time we could be spending on more important issues affecting our community			1
' @entity122 , @entity0 's chief production officer , explained that part of the issue was that a user had flagged the accounts as fake			2
he said in a blog post : ' the stories of mass impersonation , trolling , domestic abuse and higher rates of bullying and intolerance are oftentimes the result of people hiding behind fake names , and it 's both terrifying and sad			0
' our ability to successfully protect against them with this policy has borne out the reality that this policy , on balance and when applied carefully , is a very powerful force for good			0
' @entity122 accepted that many people had endured a ' painful ' experience and said they will be able to use their stage names on @entity0			2
he continued : ' i want to apologise to the affected community of drag queens , drag kings , transgender , and extensive community of our friends , neighbours , and members of the @entity159 community for the hardship that we 've put you through in dealing with your @entity0 accounts over the past few weeks			1
' the spirit of our policy is that everyone on @entity0 uses the authentic name they use in real life			1
for @entity28 , that 's @entity28			0
for @entity5 miss @entity5 , that 's @entity173			0
' he said the issue had shown up the fact that ' there 's lots of room for improvement in the reporting and enforcement mechanisms , tools for understanding who 's real and who 's not ' .			0
