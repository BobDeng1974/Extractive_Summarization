by @entity0 published : 19:21 est , 8 december 2013 updated : 07:25 est , 9 december 2013 a @entity2 councillor has denied racism accusations over comments on immigration made on a video five years ago			1
@entity7 emerged yesterday of @entity8 – a former @entity10 election candidate who defected this year – saying she wished to ‘ send the lot back ’			2
the councillor denied being offensive or politically incorrect , and insisted she had been referring only to people in the country illegally			1
@entity2 has backed its councillor @entity15 , who was filmed saying she wanted to send immigrants home party leader @entity17 dismissed allegations that she held extreme views as a political smear and indicated his party would stand by her			1
mrs @entity15 , a councillor in @entity22 , @entity23 , made the video in 2008 , to promote her bid to become a @entity10 mep			1
the @entity27 said it was provided to them by her then husband , who operated the camera			2
they have since divorced acrimoniously			2
in a section published online , she is seen rehearsing her pitch on the issue – talking about the need to control the numbers arriving in the @entity38 and to repatriate ‘ the illegals and failed asylum seekers ’			2
‘ that ’s not quite policy yet			0
maybe i should soften it a bit , ’ she says at one point , adding : ‘ ok			0
’ in a later take , she says : ‘ we must control immigration			0
we can not sustain the numbers coming in ; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous			0
@entity2 leader @entity17 backed mrs @entity15 and decried the ' appalling attack on one of our councillors ' ' control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in @entity57 and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak @entity60 so they can integrate			1
’ afterwards , she is heard to say ‘ i just want to send the lot back but i ca n’t say that ’ before joking that the remark might be used in future to ‘ get back at me , bribery , blackmail ’			0
in march mrs @entity15 made headlines by telling @entity69 publicly at a conference that she was quitting his @entity10 party for @entity2			1
at the 2010 general election she came within 714 votes of winning @entity74 from @entity75 for the conservatives			0
defending her comments , she told the @entity27 it was ‘ nothing different from what the home secretary is advocating now anyway ’			2
‘ i do n’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect , ’ she said			1
‘ i stand by what i said : illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism wo n’t work			1
it was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context			0
’ mr @entity17 went on @entity90 to decry ‘ an appalling attack on one of our councillors , falsely saying she is against all immigration ’			1
he said : ‘ i have met her two or three times and i have discussed policy at length before accepting her into the party			0
i had no reason to believe she held views that were extreme or inconsistent with ours			0
‘ while this comment looks odd and unpleasant there may be a context here that is slightly different to the way it appears			0
’ last night mrs @entity15 pointed out that the video had been made public by her ex-husband			1
in a statement she said : ‘ i have been overwhelmed with the messages of support i have been receiving , particularly via social media , and was very interested to read that many people – women in particular – read between the lines of this story and saw a man scorned and a woman trying to make her way in politics being used and caught in the crossfire of a party still trying to position itself after many years			0
