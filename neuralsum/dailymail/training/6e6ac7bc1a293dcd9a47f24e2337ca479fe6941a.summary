by @entity0 it can dwarf even the most bling of rings on @entity4			1
researchers have discovered a star the size of our planet made entirely from diamond			2
the coldest , faintest white dwarf star ever detected , it is so cool that its carbon has crystallized , forming the @entity4 - size diamond in space			1
artist impression of the the coldest , faintest white dwarf star ever detected , that is so cool that its carbon has crystallized , forming the @entity4 - size diamond in space			1
white dwarfs are the extremely dense end - states of stars like our @entity22 that have collapsed to form an object approximately the size of the @entity4			1
composed mostly of carbon and oxygen , white dwarfs slowly cool and fade over billions of years			2
the object in this new study is likely the same age as the @entity32 , approximately 11 billion years old			0
it is 900 light - years away in the direction of the constellation @entity35			1
' it ’s a really remarkable object , ' said @entity37 , a professor at the @entity38			0
' these things should be out there , but because they are so dim they are very hard to find			0
' @entity41 and his colleagues found this stellar gem using the @entity46 ’s ( @entity46 ) @entity45 ( @entity45 ) and @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , as well as other @entity49 dwarfs are the extremely dense end - states of stars like our @entity22 that have collapsed to form an object approximately the size of the @entity4			2
composed mostly of carbon and oxygen , white dwarfs slowly cool and fade over billions of years			2
the object in this new study is likely the same age as the @entity32 , approximately 11 billion years old			0
pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars , the superdense remains of massive stars that have exploded as supernovas			0
as neutron stars spin , lighthouse - like beams of radio waves , streaming from the poles of its powerful magnetic field , sweep through space			2
when one of these beams sweeps across the @entity4 , radio telescopes can capture the pulse of radio waves			0
the pulsar companion to this white dwarf , dubbed @entity77 - 0137 , was the first object in this system to be detected			1
it was found using the @entity45 by @entity81 , then a graduate student at @entity83 in @entity84			0
conditions on the star are so cool that its carbon has crystallized , forming the @entity4 - size diamond in space			1
the pulsar was then observed over a two - year period with the @entity47 by @entity93 , an astronomer at the @entity94 ( @entity95 )			0
these observations pinpointed its location and distance from the @entity4 -- approximately 900 light - years away in the direction of the constellation @entity35			1
the researchers calculated that the white dwarf would be no more than a comparatively cool 3,000 degrees @entity104 ( 2,700 degrees @entity105 )			1
our @entity22 at its center is about 5,000 times hotter			0
astronomers believe that such a cool , collapsed star would be largely crystallized carbon , not unlike a diamond			1
other such stars have been identified and they are theoretically not that rare , but with a low intrinsic brightness , they can be deucedly difficult to detect			0
its fortuitous location in a binary system with a neutron star enabled the team to identify this one .			0

@entity123 , faintest white dwarf star ever detected
so cool that its carbon has crystallized , forming the @entity4 - size diamond in space
900 light - years away in the direction of the constellation @entity35
