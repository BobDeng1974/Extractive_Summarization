it emerged on monday that @entity1 could be prepared to turn down as much as £ 180,000 per week as contract talks with @entity3 continue to stall			1
the @entity6 international 's current £ 35,000 - per - week deal has another two years to run at the end of this season and @entity1 has so far turned down a number of offers from the @entity12 club			1
@entity1 has become increasingly concerned by his constant switching of positions in the @entity3 side and has even been utilised at right wing back by @entity17			1
here , @entity18 answers five key questions on the @entity3 star ’s future			1
the @entity3 forward was in action for his country on friday night in a @entity26 qualifier @entity1 is prepared to turn down a mammoth £ 180,000 - a - week deal at @entity3 1 ) what is @entity1 ’s issue with the deal on the table ? @entity17 dug himself a hole by claiming @entity1 is the one of the best young players in @entity35			1
someone of that stature is worth , at least , £ 100,000 - per - week			2
your moral views on whether a player so young should be paid so much is irrelevant			0
you pay your best players the going rate			0
@entity1 , arguably , is @entity3 's best player meaning he should be , at least , on a par with @entity44 's £ 150,000 per week			1
likewise , there are issues with @entity1 's role in the team at the moment			1
he 's been shifted around the pitch by @entity17 - even utilised as a right wing back on occasions			2
he sees his best position as being through the middle			0
@entity1 's current £ 35,000 - per - week deal has two years to run at the end of this season the 20 - year - old scored for @entity6 in their 4 - 0 win over @entity59 at @entity60 on friday night @entity1 impressed as part of @entity6 's front three but he has been used at wing back by @entity3 2 ) what would it take to get him to sign a new deal ? certainly an improvement on the £ 90,000 - per - week deal they 've offered but even that may not be enough for him to sign			1
qualifying for the @entity70 will also help matters			0
a player of @entity1 's rising stock wants to be plying his trade on the biggest club stage of all			1
playing in the @entity78 next season is nowhere near as glamorous			0
assurances over his role in the side may help , too			0
3 ) are @entity3 losing patience with their star man ? the fans are starting to get a little restless			2
the longer this drags on , the more agitated supporters become			0
fans believe there will be a resolution but that optimism is n't shared by those in the corridors of power at @entity12			0
they know there 's a real danger of @entity1 point blank refusing to sign any sort of contract			2
@entity3 chiefs need to keep negotiations amicable			2
it 's a delicate juggling act for them			0
there will be no shortage of suitors for @entity1 should he leave @entity3 - in the @entity107 and @entity35 @entity1 takes on @entity59 's @entity108 during the @entity110 qualifier at @entity60 4 ) what is the likelihood of @entity1 leaving @entity12 in the summer ? it remains in @entity3 's hands			1
the fact of the matter is @entity1 will still have two years left on his current £ 35,000 - per - week contract this summer			1
they could sit tight and maintain he is n't for sale			0
but whether @entity3 want to risk their prized - asset entering the final year of his contract remains to be seen			0
also , will @entity17 want a player who has made it clear he does n't want to stay ? if there is no agreement over a contract , @entity1 is likely to leave this summer			2
5 ) if he was to go , what are his options ? clubs across the continent will be clambering for his signature should @entity3 decide to sell			0
@entity133 and @entity134 are both monitoring the situation carefully			0
likewise , @entity136 will be hugely interested in the forward			0
@entity138 are also keeping tabs on @entity1 's situation but the greater finances of their rivals mean they are likely to be outsiders			1
@entity1 has performed well for @entity3 but he is yet to sign a new deal to keep him at @entity12 @entity17 must convince @entity1 to sign a deal that could be one of the biggest in club 's history			1

@entity1 's current deal has two years to run after this season
@entity3 forward has turned down an offer of £ 90,000 per week
it emerged last week that @entity1 would be prepared to *reject* £ 180,000
