by @entity0 one in six universities – including top institutions such as @entity4 – have been awarding too many good degrees , a groundbreaking study has claimed			1
in the first analysis of its kind , researchers looked at the ‘ academic profile ’ of students who graduated in 2011			2
the statistics , which included exam results from school , were then used to predict what degree results the students were likely to achieve			2
experts believe that some institutions are ' over-rewarding ' top grades they discovered that out of the 123 @entity21 universities that were examined , 21 awarded significantly more firsts and 2:1s than expected			1
the list included several members of the elite @entity25 including @entity4 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
the universities insist their high rates of top degrees were down to good teaching			1
but the study , which was carried out by the @entity35 , has cast renewed doubt on the value of degree grades , which are controlled by universities with little outside scrutiny			0
external examiners – academics from other institutions – check how exams are marked but generally only ensure a consistent standard for a pass mark , rather than a first or 2:1			1
the figures led to warnings that university league tables are encouraging academics to mark exams leniently			1
institutions such as @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 ( pictured ) are named on the list experts said the research pointed to ‘ over-awarding ’ by some universities which was contributing to grade inflation			1
professor @entity61 , of the @entity62 at @entity63 , said : ‘ the results add statistical clout to the widely held view that some universities award more firsts and upper seconds than is justified by their intakes			0
one of the drivers is the natural wish of universities to score well in league tables			1
‘ the percentage of firsts and upper seconds they choose to award actually contributes significantly to those tables so there is quite an incentive to award good degrees			2
‘ almost certainly there has been inflation in degree classes			0
firsts and upper seconds have gone up too rapidly for it to be genuine improvement			0
’ experts believe that university rankings should not use results as this encourages in grade inflation and he called for the tables to stop allowing degree grades to influence rankings , saying : ‘ the biggest single contribution to allowing these difficult judgments to emerge dispassionately would be to remove that perverse incentive			2
’ professor @entity61 also pointed to strong regional patterns			0
he said that if a university saw an ‘ institution down the road giving out a lot more good degrees than they are , they may think they are being too hard on their students			2
it suggests the standard that is set is subjective			0
’ the survey also showed that 18 institutions – including @entity111 and @entity112 – awarded significantly fewer good degrees than expected			1
however @entity29 , which in 2011 handed out one of the highest proportions of firsts and 2:1s out of any university in @entity21 , awarded the top two grades to 82.8 per cent of students			1
a spokesman said its ‘ focus on excellent teaching is borne out in our degree results ’			0
@entity125 gave the top two degrees to 87.4 per cent of students and @entity4 awarded the grades to 90.9 per cent of students in 2011 – more than any other university			1
an @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ at @entity4 , we offer a high level of individual teaching			0
‘ we are confident that this approach , combined with rigorous examination processes , ensures that final degree classifications accurately reflect the very high abilities of our students			0

more than 10 percent of **college*s* are awarding more 2:1 degrees than expected
experts believe top marks are given to boost a *college* *'s* league standing
however , 18 **college*s* such as @entity111 handed out fewer top marks than expected
