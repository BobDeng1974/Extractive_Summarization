@entity0 has revealed she was raped by her kidnapper @entity1 during the eight - and - a - half years she was held captive at his house			1
she made the revelation during a television interview in @entity5 yesterday - her 25th birthday - ahead of the release of the film 3,096 days			1
the film is based on her memoir , which takes its name from the number of days spent in captivity			1
miss @entity0 has previously refused to comment on the sexual side of the complex relationship she developed with @entity1			1
speaking to talk show host @entity17 , miss @entity0 said police evidence had reached ' the public domain '			1
she said this made her agree to changes in the film 's script which showed the assaults			1
@entity17 asked her : ' so you are saying now to the public : this is what happened , now please leave me in peace ? ' she replied ; ' yes '			1
@entity1 was an @entity46 communications technician who kidnapped @entity0 on the morning of march 2 1998 on her way to school			1
he kept her in a custom built basement under his house in @entity51 near @entity52 , in @entity53			1
miss @entity0 escaped on august 23 2006 while @entity1 took a phone call			1
he killed himself by lying down in front of a train shortly after her escape			2
miss @entity0 , who has made an estimated five million pounds in tv and magazine interviews and book sales , still has mixed feelings about the man she calls ' the criminal '			2
she reportedly carries a photo of him around with her at all times , lives in his house , maintains his car and travels under a false name to foreign countries because of the attention she gets			2
miss @entity0 said last night that she wished @entity1 had lived to tell his side of the story			2
she said the cellar in his house , which she now owns , has been filled in			2
she said : ' that feels good			2
' speaking about life after her escape , she said : ' i 'm trying to commit to each day positively , to process what is happening to me			2
' that i was a child when it happened really helped me			0
as a child you are still naive and believe in justice			0
' she says she was the intellectual superior of @entity1 , who had never had a girlfriend and whose plan was to groom @entity0 until she fell in love with him			0
' the more information i learned about him , the more i could see through his intentions , ' she said			0
' i can never do the carefree youth thing			0
what helps me is talking with other other people who share their experiences of youth with me			0
' @entity94 killed himself after @entity0 escaped from his home , eight years after her kidnap miss @entity0 gave her first television interview shortly after her escape , but has refused to speak about sexual assaults during captivity until now miss @entity0 has frequently been accused of not taking opportunities to escape from @entity1			1
the bungled police investigation to find her after her disappearance is still being probed by @entity5 and @entity46 investigators			1
miss @entity0 said that although she went shopping with @entity1 , and once on a ski holiday , there was no opportunity for escape			0
she said : ' there were years of pressure on me			0
it was like an internal prison which made it impossible to flee			0
' he said he would stab anyone who tried to help me			0
' @entity121 , a child kidnap victim , and a @entity5 journalist who was tortured in @entity124 joined the discussion after 45 minutes			1
all three concurred that it was important to maintain contact with their tormentor and to remain , after freedom , in the role of the victim			0
but she said that her ' martyrdom ' is often challenged in @entity53 because people do n't believe her side of the story			0
some politicians and lawmen believe @entity1 had an accomplice and that miss @entity0 has not told the whole truth about what went on during the years she spent with him			0
' for me , this is very hard to bear , because i am almost pushed to the point of living abroad - or to kill myself , ' she said .			0
