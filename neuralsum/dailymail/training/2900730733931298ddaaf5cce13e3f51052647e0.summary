from @entity1 to @entity2 , @entity0 has a wardrobe to boot , with designers bending over backwards to dress the star in their creations			1
while she has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a @entity12 cover - one of fashion 's most famous faces has revealed that was n't always the case			1
esteemed @entity18 designer , @entity17 , has revealed that he got ' killed ' for dressing @entity0 before the style tide started to turn			1
he explains that he worked with @entity0 as a favour to his good friend @entity25 - and helped reinvent her			1
' @entity25 and me , we did it together , ' he said			2
' every designer is dying to dress her now			0
i did n't care what people thought about @entity0			1
' in the beginning , i met her because of my respect for @entity25 , and then i liked her a lot and we became friends			1
i got killed because of this			0
but i did n't care			1
' @entity17 said that while @entity0 is a ' sweet girl ' , she was accepted by ' nobody ' in the fashion industry at first @entity18 pleated plunging black gown shop the designer at @entity51 ... visit site she recently took the plunge and chopped off her trademark flowing raven locks , and it appears as though @entity0 adopted the same notion for this sartorial offering whilst out in @entity59			1
putting her voluptuous curves on display in a pleated black @entity18 gown with a neckline that left very little to the imagination , @entity0 managed to keep her class intact with the inclusion of a chic silk black blazer completing the all - black ensemble			2
proving she needs no help in regards to her pert chest area , @entity0 embodied the ‘ if you ’ve got it , flaunt it ’ mantra in the floor - grazing chiffon creation , and despite not being as confident as the reality star , we would n’t mind a slice of her style			1
there 's nothing wrong with keeping a classic black gown in the wardrobe as a safe bet ! although not available to buy online , you can still emulate @entity0 ’s look across the price spectrum ( just check the style edit below )			2
whilst we ’ve got our eye on @entity90 's deep - v gown at @entity91 , we ca n't help but fall for @entity93 's bargain creation at $ 85.50			0
we 'll be styling ours with minimal black strappy sandals and a metallic clutch bag for our next big night out			0

@entity17 is right ; @entity0 's metamorphosis has been no mean feat , for while she might now be a firm favourite with designers , her initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for @entity119 and @entity120			1
in fact , pre-fame , @entity0 also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and film star			1
despite her skills as a stylist , her own style left much to be desired			0
from bright gold dresses to garish satin , she rarely made a ' best - dressed ' list in the early part of her career			0
even as she started to make a name for herself , for a long time , @entity0 was shunned by the designers who now adore her			2
' @entity25 and me , we did it together , ' he said of @entity0 's reinvention			1
' every designer is dying to dress her now			0
i did n't care what people thought about @entity0 ' @entity17 dressed a pregnant @entity0 for the @entity146 in may 2013 just over two years ago , during a photoshoot for @entity149 at the end of 2012 , many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star			1
@entity153 , artistic director at @entity154 , styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high - end samples was a ' challenge			0
' he said : ' people would n’t lend me the clothes			0
but that ’s fashion snobbery			0
' @entity153 , who is now good friends with @entity0 , revealed that the top designers did n't want their designs featured on a woman who had , ' less - than - model - like - proportions '' however , he rightfully predicted at the time , ' she 's not the it girl yet , but she will be			1
' it truly seems @entity153 's prediction has come true ... @entity0 has become the ultimate fashion it girl			2
so close has the designer become to the global stars , that he designed the couple 's wedding outfits the 34 - year - old made sure to credit her favourite outfit - and designer - of the year recently by posting a snap on @entity183 with the caption : ' this @entity18 look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014 ' @entity0 has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper and designer 's influence over her wardrobe choices			2
@entity193 , pictured at the @entity195 awards in a daring custom - designed haute couture gunmetal skirt by @entity197 , with an @entity199 latex bodysuit with @entity201 heels , and , right , at @entity192 in @entity202 , both in september her fashion highlights to date include being asked by @entity204 , the former editor of @entity12 , to cover her @entity206 book			1
@entity0 was photographed for the cover picture by @entity2 's @entity208 and the shoot was art directed by @entity211			2
it was a controversial choice at the time , but that worked in @entity0 's favour , as @entity204 later explained to @entity215			0
she said : ' she ’s controversial , but so was @entity216 and i always like controversial people			0
' she went on to praise the reality star , saying : ' she was brave ... with @entity208 shooting			0
' she had one guy for hair , one guy for make - up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked , and she accepted everything			0
' i do n’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – i ’ve never seen her in a @entity231 jumpsuit or a basketball jacket , but she said yes to everything			0
' she was the easiest model we ’ve had			0
and when we put a mask on her face , she did n’t say anything			0
' @entity0 , wearing a @entity240 blazer , and rapper @entity25 attend the @entity240 show as part of the @entity192 - one of many of the shows at which the power couple sat in the front row before she found global fame , @entity0 worked as @entity119 's stylist and personal shopper it was following @entity252 's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular @entity0 was becoming with the world 's biggest fashion houses though , from the flood of designers that sent clothes for her new arrival , all duly documented on @entity0 's instagram page			1
from @entity18 to @entity261 and @entity262 to @entity263 , @entity0 shared photographs of @entity252 's adorable new wardrobe , signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her			2
the biggest coup came in april 2014 though , when she and @entity25 landed a joint @entity12 cover ahead of their may wedding			1
the news caused outrage among some of the magazine 's subscribers , but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year			0
that magazine sold 500,000 copies , beating both @entity282 and @entity284 's @entity12 covers			0
not her best : @entity0 was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits like the gold cocktail dress she wore at the @entity291 awards in 2008 , left , and , right , in 2010 at the @entity293 jewellery launch			2

@entity17 says he was ' killed ' for dressing @entity0 but he ' did n't care '
explains he dressed her through respect for @entity25 and now loves her
@entity0 has seen her fashion star rise and she sits frow at the biggest shows
the metamorphosis included a @entity12 cover and job as face of @entity202
