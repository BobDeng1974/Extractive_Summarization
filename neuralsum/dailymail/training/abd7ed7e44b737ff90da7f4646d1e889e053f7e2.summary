@entity2 ’s @entity1 campaign has essentially become one big @entity4 audition after it emerged that new @entity6 manager @entity5 has instructed the club to sell him			1
@entity2 — an unmitigated disaster during his first season at @entity10 last term — scored when coming on as a late substitute in @entity14 ’s opening game here in @entity16			2
he has played every minute of the three victories that have followed			0
@entity10 sources have revealed this week that @entity23 has been quite clear about who he wants and does n’t want and has told @entity31 already			0
all that remains to be seen is whether @entity6 can sell @entity2 for anything near the £ 27million they paid when buying him from @entity35 last september			2
boost : @entity14 's @entity2 has enjoyed something of a renaissance at @entity1 sacked @entity6 manager @entity38 consistently defended @entity2 last season and used to say that the 26 - year - old was @entity14 ’s ‘ stand - out player whenever i went to see them play ’			1
now it appears that @entity2 must show that form during the remainder of this tournament if he is to get a decent move ahead of the @entity4 season , which starts next month			0
high point : @entity2 , left , has helped @entity14 reach the last eight in @entity16 with @entity14 through to face @entity51 in the last eight of the @entity1 , it is unlikely @entity2 will join @entity6 on their two - week tour of @entity54 that begins on july 21			1
therefore , he is unlikely to have any chance to impress @entity23 at close quarters and change the @entity58 ’s mind			0
ruthless : @entity5 has made it clear which players he wants when he takes charge at @entity6 @entity62 will rebuild @entity6 - @entity63 dud : @entity2 struggled to make an impact following £ 27m move from @entity35			1

new boss @entity23 has told @entity6 to sell *midfielder*
@entity2 has *failed* to make an impact since joining from @entity35
he has played in @entity14 's last three games at @entity1 2014
