by @entity0 a father has spent nearly two decades unable to feel excited or sad , after a freak motorbike accident in his youth left him brain damaged			1
army veteran @entity5 , 39 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was just 20 when he was hit by a car while stationed in @entity9			1
although he has since married and had a son and daughter , mr @entity5 has not been able to feel excitement since the accident			1
this is because his injuries damaged the part of the brain that deals with emotion			2
long way back : since @entity5 , 39 , pictured with children @entity21 , 11 , and @entity22 , seven , was hit on his motorbike aged 20 , he has been unable to feel excitement or sadness mr @entity5 suffered severe head injuries in the accident in 1995 and spent the following ten weeks in a coma			1
the former soldier was left virtually blind , semi-paralysed and the part of his brain which deals with emotion was almost wiped out			1
despite doctors saying he would never walk again , he has since had a remarkable recovery and in 2000 , met his wife @entity34 , now 45 - although due to his short term memory loss it took him a year - and - a - half to remember her name			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i still struggle with names - i even get my children ’s names mixed up all the time			1
i am fine with numbers , but names and places i just ca n’t remember			0
’ happy , but not excited : mr @entity5 med @entity34 five years after the accident , but was not struck by nerves on his wedding day in 2002 ‘ and when i came out of my coma i was talking gobbledegook , but to me it sounded like perfect @entity49			1
the couple married in 2000 , and have since had two children , @entity21 , 11 , and @entity22 , seven			1
but neither his wedding day or the birth of his children sent mr @entity5 on to the roller - coaster of emotion most people would experience			1
he has now written about his experiences in his book called @entity60 and raises money for charity @entity62			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ people say that i am very " one level " , especially in my facial expression			1
' i ’m never bothered by much , just very relaxed			0
i do n’t get excited , ecstatic , or desperately sad - i just have one level now			0
calm life : mr @entity5 is more interested in spending time with his family and painting than the thrills of soldier life ‘ i never had a proper laugh , i ’m just quite nonplussed about things			2
’ with the support of his family , he has defied doctors who said he would n’t walk again and through gruelling physiotherapy , has regained some mobility			2
the limbic system is the collective name for structures in the human brain involved in emotion , motivation , and emotional association with memory			0
there are several main parts of this system , including the hippocampus - the memory centre - and amygdala - the fear centre and the hippocampus			0
damage to the limbic system can severely affect a person 's memory and emotional response to events , @entity101 , spokesperson for @entity102 , the brain injury association , said : ‘ a brain injury can effect everything we do , think and feel			2
‘ the emotional and behavioural impact of brain injuries can be devastating for individuals and families alike and can include an inability to control anger and irritability , a lack of empathy and a general lack control over one 's emotions			0
‘ recognising and understanding these changes is a vital part of rebuilding one 's life after brain injury			0
’ mr @entity5 said : ‘ i just crack on with things , there is no point letting it get me down			2
' when i was a soldier i would say i would rather be dead than disabled , but now i see how foolish i was			0
‘ since my accident i have married my wife and had two fantastic children , whom i love dearly			1
' mr @entity5 expresses himself through painting , and despite having limited vision , he has learnt how to paint with the help of charity blind veterans			1
but although he has worked hard to overcome his physical disabilities , he has found his emotions stay the same			0
his wedding to @entity34 , for example , was somewhat subdued experience			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ it was a fantastic day and the weather was beautiful but beforehand i did n’t have excitement for it			1
it ’s just part of who i am now , to have emotions on one level			0
’ mr @entity5 , a former soldier in the 1st @entity151 and @entity152 regiment , had a glittering career in the army ahead of him			2
he served in @entity9 , @entity155 and did a tour of @entity157 , was one of the fittest in his regiment and was the top gunner for the @entity163 tank			2
back in the days : a collect of @entity5 in the army , before he suffered the motorbike accident in 1995 mr @entity5 has served as a part of the @entity168 forces in @entity157 and was stationed in @entity9 at the time of the accident family man : mr @entity5 , pictured with son @entity22 in hospital , says that although he adores his family , he does not get excited about things like theme parks , travel or birthdays mr @entity5 was lucky to survive the accident and while he was in a coma his weight dropped from 12 stone to five - and - a - half			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i am paralysed on the right hand side from my nose to my toes but even though the doctors said i would never walk again i have proved them wrong			1
’ he no longer uses a wheelchair - instead , his right leg is encased in a plaster cast , but he is able to walk around and has even completed the @entity190 marathon , in one day and ten hours			1
he has also accepted that he wo n’t experience the same highs and lows in life as other people do			0
‘ i just get on with it			0
my children have given me a reason to live			0
' when i was in the army i travelled all over the world and was always kept busy			0
‘ after my accident my life completely changed and i could no longer complete my ambition of rising up the ranks in the army			2
‘ but now i have the kids , it gives me a task to do , a task which will always be there and i ’ll always be looking after my children no matter what age they are			0
