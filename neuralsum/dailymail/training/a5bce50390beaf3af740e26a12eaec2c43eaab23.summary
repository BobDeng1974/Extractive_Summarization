have you ever wondered if @entity1 is actually bothered ? i ’m not for one second suggesting he does n’t care about his work , or that he is n’t trying			1
he is a professional , anyone with even the slightest knowledge of his career will know that			0
but throw forward to summer 2015			0
imagine that @entity10 finished outside the top four and did n’t achieve the target of making it into the @entity15 next season			1
he might be sacked , but there is a chance @entity19 might still be at @entity10			1
either way , he will be the subject of fierce , and understandable , criticism for his failure to lift @entity10 into the top four			1
@entity1 ( centre ) hangs his head as @entity10 slip to a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity29 captain @entity30 ( second right ) and his team - mates looked sick after @entity29 's second goal my own view is that if he makes it in to the top four , fine			1
if he does n’t then he has failed in his first season at @entity10 , even if they lift the @entity40			1
but i ca n’t believe @entity19 will lose sleep , because his reputation is totally intact whatever happens under him at @entity44			1
his place among the greats is already assured			0
he has won titles in three different countries with four different clubs			1
his @entity15 - winning @entity51 team in 1995 was stunning			1
they knew their jobs , they were organised to the point of boring efficiency , but with the sparkling creativity of @entity57 on one wing , @entity59 on the other and the sublime @entity61 at his peak in the fantasy role			0
that team was the perfect mix of function and flair ; it ’s a team that will go down in football history as one of the very best			0
critics might say they underachieved , but that was n’t a failing of @entity19			2
it was thanks mainly to the emergence and effects of the @entity78 ruling , which saw @entity51 unable to keep those players together			0
@entity19 lifts the @entity15 in 1995 after @entity51 's improbable victory over @entity81 @entity19 's @entity51 side lifted club football 's most prestigious trophy with a blend of flair and efficiency one of his spells with the @entity90 national side was a disaster , the other saw them finish third in the world			1
in @entity94 , he even managed to win a penalty shootout ( the @entity90 are as fearful of these things as the @entity97 ) with an innovative substitution ( throwing on @entity99 at the death ) boosting his reputation hugely			2
he then lost one in the semi-final			0
so he ’s not the greatest , but @entity19 is certainly one of the greats			2
if you ’re still not convinced , then i refer to you the work of the man named coach of the century by @entity111 in 1999			0
in his brilliant book teambuilding : the @entity116 , @entity115 names several ' top - notch coaches ' to whom the ' evolution of the game of football can be attributed to			1
these coaches developed team tactical innovations which improved the performance level of their teams			0
' @entity115 added : ' due to the success of these coaches other coaches plunged into these new styles of play			2
' @entity115 then lists these coaches : the @entity94 legend @entity130 ; @entity132 pragmatist @entity131 – the catenaccio king , successful at three @entity134 giants but notably at @entity135 ; sir @entity136 and his wingless wonders developing the 4 - 4 - 2 system with @entity141 ’s @entity140 winners in 1966 ; @entity115 himself ( he was n’t modest , understandably so given his record ) for bringing @entity144 to the table ; @entity146 ’s @entity140 - winning 3 - 5 - 2 with marauding full backs ; @entity148 who created history at @entity150 with his 3 - 4 - 3 designed to control midfield and therefore control the game ; and then last on the chronological list , @entity19 , who further developed @entity148 ’s ideas			1
legendary coach @entity115 is held aloft by his players after @entity157 's @entity156 success the book was published in 2001 , @entity115 died in 2005 , so we can only guess who might be added to the list : possibly @entity163 , surely @entity164			2
even so , for @entity19 to be included on the original list is surely evidence of how much he is respected within global coaching circles			2
he ’s been at that level for a long time			0
of course some players hated him , @entity169 was particularly scathing when he left @entity150			0
but then you only have to look at the number of quality players who have followed him to a new club to realise as many , probably more , loved working under him			0
journalists have fallen out with him in the past – the brilliant @entity90 football journalist @entity178 was close to @entity19 but they fell out			1
@entity178 ’s book on the @entity10 boss , @entity181 , @entity182 , is one of the best i ’ve read in the past few months			2
@entity19 coached @entity164 ( left ) while at @entity150 i do n’t know @entity19 personally but professionally i ’ve always found him charming and engaging			0
however , i am under no illusions , this situation could change at any moment			0
so with @entity10 still trying to recover from losing a brilliant manager and an efficient chief executive in the summer of 2013 , @entity19 knows he may succeed or he may fail			1
he obviously wants to get it right , but if he does n’t , he may choose to retire in his mid- 60s , safe in the knowledge that his reputation as one of the great coaches in the history of football is intact			0
meanwhile , some bang average ex-footballers on @entity97 television will still be trying to tell us all that @entity19 does n’t know what he ’s doing			0
one wonders if these former ' @entity202 greats ' have even heard of @entity115 .			1

@entity10 currently fourth in @entity202 table
@entity1 tasked with achieving top - four finish in his first season
united a point clear of fifth but @entity19 wo *n't* lose sleep if they miss out
@entity90 has won four titles in three countries and a @entity15
@entity115 named him among the best ever coaches
