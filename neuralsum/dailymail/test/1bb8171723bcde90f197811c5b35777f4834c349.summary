they 're professionally trained to project their voices for stage and screen , so it 's unsurprising that the nation 's most popular actors might use one of their best assets to secure lucrative work with the best deals said to be worth around Â£ 50,000			1
however , while voiceover work might be a salary - boosting sideline , it can go down like a lead balloon with other employers , as @entity18 actress @entity17 discovered to her peril recently			1
executives at @entity18 have reportedly just overturned a ban on their cast offering their dulcet tones to radio advertising campaigns after rumours of a near - mutiny among its actors , the catalyst for which was @entity17 's extensive voiceover work			1
put a sock in it : in the past @entity18 has reportedly tried to silence its stars when they 've asked to do voiceover work for television adverts			1
complaints from actors have led bosses to revise the ban @entity17 , who played @entity41 on the @entity18 , pictured here on set with actor @entity44 , has been the voice behind many ad campaigns including @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 according to the @entity51 , one of the soap 's biggest names , @entity17 , who until last month played @entity41 , was said to have been given a telling off for taking on a voiceover job for the @entity57			1
the show 's bosses were said to be disgruntled that @entity17 was lending her voice to a rival station and thus potentially advertising the @entity18 's biggest competitor , @entity63			1
pressure from fellow actors is said to have caused bosses to relent and enable their ' talent ' to take on radio voiceover jobs , although television adverts are said to still be strictly forbidden			1
for those actors not tied to tricky contracts , the voiceover world can be a very rewarding one with plenty of big - name companies prepared to put their money where their mouths are if it means securing a star that they feel might help them sell more of their product			1
from @entity82 to @entity83 , it seems everyone is happy to get behind a microphone and cash in			2
below , we look at the stars who 've lent their vocal chords to various campaigns : we could listen to him all day ... @entity82 has occasionally branched out from acting to lend his voice to advertising campaigns			1
brands that have snapped up the @entity96 star include @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 @entity82 the @entity101 star may be one of the hottest properties in @entity103 but that has n't stopped the @entity96 actor from enjoying the other opportunities that have come his way			1
with his particular brand of well spoken @entity110 , it 's unsurprising that upmarket car manufacturer @entity97 chose him to talk over their ads. a little more surprising is that mr @entity112 also provided the audio for @entity99			1
last summer , the star was paid a rumoured six - figure sum to help the dog - friendly company get their message across about pet dental hygiene			2
@entity122 with his wacky image and the coolest set of friends on the block , @entity124 frontman might not seem like someone who you 'd naturally choose to advertise a mobile phone company but money talks and @entity122 can count @entity133 amongst his voiceover clients			2
@entity135 he uttered the phrase ' @entity137 ' and a million women fell in love			0
@entity135 , now playing football in @entity141 , is still available for voiceover work but may never reach the dizzying heights of those @entity145 ads , which launched his career away from the pitch and also saw him marry his co-star @entity148			1
the couple have since divorced			0
the @entity151 's other ads have included @entity152 and @entity153			2
pitch perfect : @entity156 's distinctive intonation has seen her voice used in plenty of advertising campaigns including for @entity161 toilet tissue ( pictured ) , @entity162 's and @entity163 money down the pan : @entity166 and @entity168 star @entity167 used voiceover work to boost his income inbetween jobs before making it big			1
clients included @entity175 toilet cleaner @entity156 the @entity177 star has become one of the nation 's favourite actresses but can boast a surprisingly varied career in the world of voiceovers too			1
thanks to her distinctive intonation , @entity156 has laid down vocals for companies that include @entity161 , @entity188 , @entity162 's and @entity163			1
now that @entity156 is expecting a baby at 41 , might she turn to the less demanding world of voiceover work once more ? @entity192 the love actually actor , 65 , has a prolific voiceover portfolio , having got behind the microphone for campaigns for brands including @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203			1
he 's described by voice over agency @entity206 as : ' a cool , confident , sharp , witty and well - loved @entity110 gent with a distinctive familiar and trustworthy delivery			2
' @entity209 he 's the proudest of @entity211 so it 's no surprise that @entity209 might put his name to a campaign that would entice visitors to descend upon his homeland for a holiday			2
for @entity220 this year , the @entity103 actor 's velvety tones could be heard on the @entity222 video promoting the @entity223			0
@entity209 said he was happy the 60 - second clip would help ' nations come together to celebrate the fun and warmth of the @entity223 '			0
the gift of the gab : @entity209 recently voiced adverts for @entity222 , which promoted visitors to the @entity223 ahead of @entity220 in mid march plenty of cash : @entity63 star @entity234 has used his cockney sparrow vocals to secure work for companies such as @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 ( pictured right ) in 1973 , @entity243 's father @entity242 sang the famous @entity245 lemonade song , @entity246			1
acted by actor and mime @entity248 , @entity242 lent his voice - and his son , who was then known as @entity252 , rather than @entity243 - provided the backing vocals in the cult ad which ran until 1984 and featured a man in striped pyjamas creeping downstairs to raid the fridge for the fizzy drink			0
@entity243 's father sang the famous lyrics , ' i 'm a secret lemonade drinker ' in the @entity245 ad @entity264 it 's an instantly recognisable voice , charged with camp and irony			2
comedian @entity264 has supplemented his stand - up and television work by putting down his arch tones for companies such as @entity272 , @entity199 and @entity273			0
@entity264 is also the voice behind @entity275 , a show for toddlers about a mischievous young royal that appears on @entity280			0
@entity167 before finding fame in @entity166 , @entity282 - of - five @entity167 brought home the bacon with various voiceover jobs ; his @entity287 lilt in demand by the likes of @entity290 , @entity145 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity162 's			2
the comedian has described himself as ' affable ' , a style which clearly goes down well with the nation 's consumers			0
@entity297 the @entity223 actress has plenty of stage and screen roles behind her including @entity302 and @entity303 but one , very brief , advert has put her into advertising folklore			0
when she seductively described a chocolate pudding for a @entity309 's advert in 2005 , sales soared			0
she said at the time : ' i went totally over the top			0
when i hear them on the radio i ca n't stop laughing			0
i can barely believe it 's me			0
' the ' this is not just food ... ' advert was so successful it was reborn again last year ... and spawned plenty of spoofs on the internet			0
@entity322 the last tango in @entity325 star has become one of the most popular faces on screen in recent years			0
her voice is pretty recognisable too having provided the soundtrack for adverts for @entity332 , @entity203 , @entity333 and @entity334 amongst others			0
the right voice can make millions for a company , as @entity223 actress @entity297 proved for @entity309 in 2005 how do you make a chocolate pudding sound sexy ? @entity223 actress @entity297 managed it in 2005 for @entity309 ... sales promptly soared and the company used a similar format again last year the higher end of the vocal range : the master of squeak @entity346 has put his unique voice on ads for @entity350 , while @entity264 has camped it up for @entity272 , @entity199 and @entity273 @entity234 as a leading character in @entity63 , @entity234 's @entity352 twang has long since been his trademark			1
the @entity356 - born actor has used his larynx to great effect in the world of voiceovers , using it to promote @entity361 , @entity239 , @entity238 and plenty kitchen roll			1
@entity346 the squeaky - voiced comedian has been blessed with one of life 's more interesting - sounding voiceboxes so it 's unsurprising that he 's in demand			0
previous work includes the @entity350 and @entity370			0
@entity371 @entity374 's partner , @entity151 - born actress @entity372 has worked her @entity376 magic on adverts for brands including @entity379 and @entity380			0
@entity381 regional accents can pull in the biggest contracts			0
