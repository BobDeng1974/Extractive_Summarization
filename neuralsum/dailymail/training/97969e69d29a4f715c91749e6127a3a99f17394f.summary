@entity0 hit an imperious century to become @entity2 's highest one - day international run - scorer and leave @entity3 with a chase of 304 at the @entity5			1
@entity0 made 141 in 125 balls at the head of the innings , making another eloquent case for the role of authentic batsmanship in the 50 - over format			2
his was a typically classy effort , peppered with crisp drives and exquisite placement , and took him past @entity18 's previous @entity17 record of 5,092 runs			1
@entity0 hit a century against @entity3 to move past @entity18 's previous record of 5,092 runs @entity21 - born @entity0 is only the second @entity17 to surpass 5,000 odi runs for his country but although @entity2 's 303 for eight was a good riposte having been asked to bat first , a return of 59 for five in the last 10 overs was an underwhelming end to proceedings			1
while @entity0 and @entity31 ( 69 ) can reflect on a job well done , captain @entity30 is having a tougher time			1
less then 24 hours after the revelation of a lurid blackmail plot against him , @entity2 's new captain was snared for a golden duck			1
@entity0 's form on tour has been largely excellent , with 187 in a warm - up match against the @entity42 and an effortless 88 not out in victory over @entity44			2
new captain @entity30 is bowled out after just one ball against @entity3 , 24 hours after being blackmailed @entity0 ( right ) celebrates with @entity2 team - mate @entity31 ( left ) as he scores his century against @entity3 player , matches , inns , runs @entity0 , 153 , 149 , 5136 @entity18 , 197 , 181 , 5092 @entity52 , 170 , 162 , 4677 @entity53 , 134 , 123 , 4422 @entity54 , 123 , 122 , 4335 @entity55 , 125 , 122 , 4290 @entity56 , 127 , 126 , 4205 @entity57 , 122 , 118 , 4010 @entity58 , 120 , 118 , 3846 @entity59 , 100 , 100 , 3637 the only black mark was falling first ball of the match in the first game against @entity3			1
and history almost repeated itself as he failed to control @entity67 's opening delivery and was fortunate his mis - hit did not go to hands			0
after that he unloaded a series of early boundaries , including three in @entity67 's second over as he became just the second @entity17 to reach 5,000 odi runs			2
the @entity21 man even managed to draw some reluctant applause from the locals with an effortless back - foot drive for four			0
@entity79 was a virtual passenger in the opening exchanges but exploded to life in the ninth over with three consecutive sixes off @entity84			0
the first crept over the mid-wicket rope , the second cleared it comfortably and the third was carried over the line by long - leg fielder @entity90 as he attempted to hang on to a near - impossible catch			0
having been 39 for four at the 10 - over mark in @entity94 , @entity2 were now 69 without loss			2
the end of fielding restrictions stemmed the flow of boundaries but @entity0 's intuitive ability to locate gaps ensured the hundred stand came at better than a run per ball			2
@entity79 fell for a hit - and - miss 46 , deceived by @entity105 after stepping down the track , while @entity107 lasted 14 awkward balls before lofting @entity109 to mid-off			0
@entity0 's century helped @entity2 to leave @entity3 with a chase of 304 after batting first @entity0 's only life came on 80 , @entity114 grassing a thick edge off @entity105 , and he quickly reeled in @entity117 's record and his own hundred			1
his latest partner , @entity31 , was scoring busily at the other end and the pair went on to add 121 for the third wicket			0
@entity0 managed a first six with nine overs to go , @entity84 again going all the way , but had run out of steam by the time he lofted @entity126 to @entity67 at mid-off			0
@entity30 was next in and failed to banish his recent troubles by nicking his first ball from @entity126			0
@entity2 never regained their momentum , @entity31 unable to last the course and @entity132 bowled round his legs , while @entity134 and @entity135 were run out from the last two balls of the innings			0
@entity2 's @entity132 bats for @entity2 against @entity3			1

@entity0 broke @entity18 's record of 5,092 runs for @entity2
@entity2 left @entity3 with a chase of 304 after batting first
@entity30 was targeted by an *alleged* blackmailer before the match
the new @entity2 captain was snared for a golden duck
