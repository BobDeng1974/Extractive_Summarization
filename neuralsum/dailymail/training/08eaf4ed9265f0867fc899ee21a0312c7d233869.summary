but now the @entity13 , nicknamed ' @entity14 ' , has dismissed such speculation			0
' i do n’t want to leave @entity2 , ' he told @entity17 , ' i ’m very happy and very settled here			1
' after a blistering first half to the season that saw the @entity8 international become a favourite among @entity2 fans , the striker picked up a muscle injury that derailed his season			1
