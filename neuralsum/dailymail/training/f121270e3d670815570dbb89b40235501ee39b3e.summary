actually , he did n’t rant or rave			0
@entity1 made his points lucidly and , for the most part , logically			1
a little whiny , perhaps			0
for that alone , there should be no question of further action from the @entity8 over his impromptu guest spot on sunday			0
calling a referee a cheat is actionable , but @entity1 took care to be respectful			1
his belief that @entity15 alone are suffering from official incompetence also does his cause few favours , and his memory is as selective as any manager ( he forgot @entity22 ’s dive against @entity23 , for instance )			1
@entity1 asked specifically to be a guest on @entity27 ' show goals on sunday to air his grievances @entity1 was right with his comments , if a little one - eyed , and he spoke lucidly and logically on the show the studs - up tackle from @entity32 infuriated @entity15 star @entity33 and his manager @entity1 click here to read more from @entity37 's chief sports writer @entity36 yet the crux of the debate — why violent , career - threatening tackles seem to be less of an issue in @entity43 football than a dozen or so matters of little consequence , is a debate that needs to take place , and urgently			1
our referees are well equipped to spot when a player has celebrated inappropriately , minus shirt			0
when one has come in late , over the top and with malicious intent , they too often seem baffled , or at least underwhelmed			0
nobody is under any illusion about @entity1 ’s motives			1
he did not commandeer television airtime to protest on behalf of @entity60			0
we know precisely who will benefit if referees can be pressured into avoiding controversy around @entity15 players			1
@entity33 's reaction to @entity32 's tackle earned the @entity67 a red card - he 'll now miss the @entity70 final if @entity71 can not tell that @entity32 ' tackle was violent , maybe he should take some time away from the game a refereeing performance in a @entity75 or @entity76 country like @entity71 's at @entity77 on saturday would have started accusations of corruption			1
here in @entity43 thankfully we accept honest incompetence			0
click here to read @entity83 's analysis there are those who think @entity1 harms the sport with these off - field power plays , and they have a point			1
@entity32 of @entity90 should have followed @entity33 down the tunnel on saturday			1
@entity33 ’s retaliation merited a red card , but so did @entity32 ’s tackle			1
at the very least his behaviour was worthy of two yellows , having already hit @entity96 in mid-air in the first half			0
referee @entity71 punished neither challenge			1
his performance was extraordinarily poor			0
@entity1 is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign , but entitled to ask questions			2
his players , fine players , are frequently under siege			0
not since @entity105 at @entity106 has a ball - carrying forward been treated as brutally as @entity109 this season			0
@entity71 's refereeing performance was extraordinarily poor for @entity15 's game against @entity90 on saturday @entity109 has been treated brutally by opposition players this season , and @entity1 is right to protect him @entity105 , however , was becoming a world star and referees were intimidated by him			1
he would fall and seize hold of the ball , stopping the game and pre-empting the decision to award a foul in his favour			2
he did n’t even make a fuss when @entity124 of @entity125 committed one of the most spectacularly vicious tackles seen in this campaign			0
somehow the defender stayed on			0
so @entity1 is justified in raising the issue , even if his chosen method is unconventional			2
could he have aired the same grievances in private , opened dialogue with @entity134 , chief of the @entity135 ? yes — but one presumes he has those conversations all the time			1
by using a public forum , and an expansive 27 minutes of it , @entity1 broadens discussion			2
after @entity1 requested to go on @entity141 , planned guest @entity140 had to make way @entity1 's visit to the @entity144 could have been made more interesting if he was joined by @entity134 it would have been more interesting to invite @entity134 into the studio , too , but there is no way that happens in the present climate			1
the days of @entity150 versus @entity151 have passed			0
the default position of the authorities is to scan the news for any sign of controversy and then act			0
they will study @entity1 ’s appearance , have no doubt of it			1
they prefer silencing dissent rather than questioning its motives ; just as @entity71 had the wit to deal with @entity33 ’s obvious transgression , but no clue that @entity32 came close to snapping his leg in two			1
there is no chance @entity33 will get his red card rescinded , no matter the sense of injustice			0
he threw a player to the ground and that is a sending - off offence			0
the @entity15 manager did not look happy as he watched on from the sidelines , and later aired his thoughts his absence from the @entity70 final , as well as league games against @entity183 and @entity184 is a big loss for @entity15			1
yet if @entity71 does not know what a violent foul is maybe he needs to take a little time away from the game , too			1
any idiot can spot that @entity33 had to go but a leading official should be able to see cause and effect			0
too many violent tackles are waved away these days			0
hazard has seriously discussed getting larger shin pads to combat the kicking he receives ; that should concern the authorities more than any manager ’s well - honed grievance			0
after @entity15 's game against @entity90 , @entity1 listed four minutes ; four key incidents that he believed the referee had got wrong			1
here , @entity37 looks at them : 30 - @entity32 sends @entity96 crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back			2
@entity96 rolls over twice before leaping up when he realises no action is being taken			0
it should have been a free - kick and could have been a yellow card for @entity32			2
@entity32 catches @entity96 with his right boot during an aerial challenge in the 30th minute 33 - @entity96 goes for goal but @entity214 diverts it with an outstretched arm , as he turns his back to goal			2
it should have been a @entity15 penalty			2
@entity96 fires a shot at goal but his effort was blocked by the raised arms of @entity214 43 - @entity225 goes to ground after @entity226 leans into him with an oustretched arm			0
it could have been a @entity15 penalty but would have been soft			2
@entity225 vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by @entity226 69 - @entity32 misses the ball and almost snaps @entity33 's left shin with his studs but @entity71 waves play on			1
an enraged @entity33 leaps up and pushes @entity32 over			2
@entity71 sends off @entity33 and books @entity96 for trying to take red card out of his hand			2
it was a shocking tackle that merited a red card for @entity32 and a @entity15 free - kick			1
referee @entity71 shows @entity33 a straight red card after his altercation with @entity32 in the second half @entity245			1

@entity1 asked to appear on goals on sunday in the wake of @entity15 's draw with @entity90 on saturday *afternoon*
he aired his grievances on refereeing incompetence involving @entity15
if @entity71 does not know that @entity32 ' tackle is a violent foul , maybe he should take some time away from the game
