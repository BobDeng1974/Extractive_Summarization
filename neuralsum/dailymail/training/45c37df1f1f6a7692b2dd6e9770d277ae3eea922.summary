by @entity0 published : 08:15 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 12:29 est , 7 march 2014 a mother has accused a private girls ' school of ' barring ' her daughter while she was recovering from anorexia because they feared she might inspire ' copycat ' cases			1
@entity9 , 16 , has spent the last two years battling with the severe eating disorder - enduring a year in and out of hospital as her weight plummeted to just six stone			1
but when it came to rejoining her classmates at the fee - paying @entity16 to finish her gcse studies , she was told her inclusion ' would be too disruptive ' , according to her mother			1
accusation : @entity20 and her daughter @entity21 have accused @entity22 of ' abandoning ' the 16 - year - old because of her eating disorder support : @entity20 and @entity9 said they were devastated when they were told the 16 - year - old could not rejoin her friends at @entity22 ' without a doubt one of the main reasons @entity21 was not allowed back to school was because she was someone who lots of people looked up to			1
in the head teacher 's eyes , she may well have inspired copycat disorders , ' @entity20 told the @entity38			1
@entity21 left the school to get intensive treatment for her disorder from a specialist @entity43 clinic after developing the potentially lethal disorder aged 14			2
after being discharged from hospital last year , she had hoped to go back to school on a part - time basis until she fully regained her strength			1
but her hopes of fitting back into school life were dealt a blow when the school said it did not want her to return until she was well enough to come back on a full - time basis			1
care : @entity9 , pictured , left @entity22 to get treatment for anorexia barred : @entity9 nearly died from anorexia which she developed when she was 14 but was asked not to return to her old school until she had fully recovered @entity21 , who is now a pupil at @entity58 , in @entity59 , said the rejection was devastating			1
describing the upset at not being able to immediately rejoin her friends , she told the @entity63 : ' i was very upset about it			0
i almost died and without the support of my friends i would not have pulled through			0
alumna : dame @entity69 , former director general of @entity70 , is a former pupil of @entity22 ' i was completely ready to go back and be with them and just get back to normal but i was told the school were n’t able to have me back			2
it would have given me such a boost to my progress			0
' @entity21 's father , @entity76 , 46 , who divorced from her mother several years ago , has also attacked the school - whose past pupils include baroness @entity80 , former private secretary to @entity82 , and @entity69 , former director general of @entity70 - over its treatment of his daughter			1
he said : ' the school 's response to @entity21 coming back was pretty poor			2
people suffering from anorexia are encouraged to work towards a particular goal and @entity21 was working towards getting back into school and to be with her friends			2
' this was all taken away from her when the head teacher made it clear she was not welcome back			0
@entity21 has shown remarkable courage and determination to get this point			0
' @entity99 , particularly amongst teenage girls is not as uncommon as people think and schools need to be aware of that			0
' mr @entity104 told how he feared the eating disorder would kill his daughter at one stage			0
upset : @entity9 says she was distraught at not being able to rejoin her classmates exclusion : @entity9 said she was devastated when she was told she could not rejoin her classmates ' at its worst , we thought this might be it for @entity21			2
she needed to be forcibly fed through a tube and she went from a happy , healthy teenager to nothing at all			0
' @entity20 and i divorced a few years ago and we have considered whether this had an impact on @entity21			0
' she became obsessed with her weight and appearance			0
she would look at pictures of celebrities in magazines and on the internet and was convinced she was fat and ugly			0
' the school has rejected the criticism leveled at it by ms @entity9 and disputed the version of events given by the pupil 's mother			1
critical : mother @entity20 has criticised @entity22 , pictured , for not allowing her daughter @entity21 to return on a part - time basis rebuttal : @entity22 , left , and headmistress @entity135 , right , have refuted the @entity9 family 's version of events and said pupil health and wellbeing was ' at the heart of everything we do ' a statement issued by the school said : ' the school responded to say that they were very keen to support @entity21 ’s integration but remained of the view that it would be preferable to wait until @entity21 was well enough to return on a full - time basis			1
' the health and wellbeing of our pupils is at the heart of everything we do ... the professional view of the head and her team was that an interrupted part - time programme in a crucial year would not be in the interests of @entity21 ’s welfare or education			1
' to say that @entity21 was excluded is simply not true as is the assertion we were concerned about copycat issues			0
' in school our approach is very pro-active and open in talking about and raising awareness of such issues through a variety of means including @entity173 lessons , tutorial support , extra-curricular sessions where guest speakers address the girls and parent talks / workshops , as well as having a full time nurse and the services of a school counsellor			2
