by @entity0 @entity2 fans have been left ' inconsolable ' after buying standing tickets for the band 's hotly anticipated arena tour only to discover that under - 12s must be seated			1
parents have been treating their children to tickets for the group 's concerts , but some have failed to read the small print which includes restrictions for the youngest fans			1
one of those is @entity17 who bought her eight - year - old daughter @entity19 a Â £ 50 ticket to see the band at the @entity22 in @entity23 next month			1
' inconsolable ' : eight - year - old @entity19 is devastated after being bought standing tickets to see her idols one direction on their arena tour only to learn that under - 12s must be seated at their gigs @entity19 , who has a shrine to @entity31 in her room , was all set to see her idols on may 28 with her mother , aunt @entity35 , 42 , and cousin @entity36 , 11 , who is also banned from the standing area			1
but last week mrs @entity17 , of @entity38 , near @entity39 , saw an article in their local paper about how under - 12s would not be allowed into the standing stalls			2
mrs @entity17 , 36 , said she had n't read the small print on the website when she paid for the tickets			1
she said : ' @entity19 is inconsolable and she has n't stopped crying			2
it is so cruel to raise a little girl 's hopes like this only to dash them			0
' when i saw it in the paper i contacted the stadium to double check it was correct			0
i can see absolutely no reason why kids are n't allowed in the standing area			0
glum direction : @entity19 had been all set to see her idols on may 28 with her mother @entity17 ( left ) , aunt @entity35 , 42 , and cousin @entity36 , 11 , who is also banned from the standing area shrine : @entity19 has been a @entity2 fan since they were on the x-factor four years ago ' it is absolutely ridiculous , they say it is for health and safety reasons , but that is just stupid			1
' i would have been right beside @entity19 the whole time , and if there had been any trouble i could have just picked her up			2
' we have been in the standing area of concerts before and it is absolutely fine			0
' i am not sure if @entity2 are involved , but the stadium have said it is not their policy , it has come from one direction			0
' i do n't think this will stop @entity19 from liking @entity2 , but i am certainly not happy with them			2
' mrs @entity17 says is now desperately trying to sell her tickets online and says she can not bear to attend the concert without her daughter			0
rules : age restrictions have been put in place at every gig by @entity2 ( above ) for safety reasons venue : one of the gigs is being held at @entity23 's @entity22 ground ( above ) she believes that the terms and conditions should have been made a lot more clearer on purchase			1
@entity19 has been a @entity2 fan since they were on the x-factor and her favourite is louis			0
she was also left devastated last year when her mother failed to get her a ticket because they had all sold out			2
@entity2 's management , @entity110 , were approached for a comment but did not respond			0
a spokesperson for the @entity22 said : ' the age restrictions apply to every @entity2 show at every @entity116 venue , they are not specific to the @entity22 and have been put in place centrally to ensure the safety and comfort of everyone attending the concerts			1
' the terms and conditions of sale of the tickets , along with @entity126 's on the various ticketing websites , clearly state the age restrictions at point of purchase			0
