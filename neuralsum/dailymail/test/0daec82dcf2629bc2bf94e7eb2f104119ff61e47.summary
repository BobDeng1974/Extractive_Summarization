while every aspiring actor dreams of @entity3 stardom , an a-list career does n't always show up			0
for actors hovering somewhere between the big time and the dole queue , there is the comforting world of the @entity10 soap opera , where stars are guaranteed regular work and a spot in the nation 's living room three times a week			1
if long - running series such as @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 have been a launchpad for many an acting career , it 's also provided a safe haven for those looking to side - step from a different career or reinvigorate their public profile			1
the former @entity41 star has admitted that she 's turned down the offer twice before this week saw some big - name announcements in the land of soap , with former @entity34 star @entity32 announcing that she 's putting her pop career on hold to star in at least four episodes of @entity20			1
a street insider told the mirror : ' we 're delighted to land @entity32 - her character has real potential			1
' she will prove a real trouble - making fly - in - the - ointment - especially for @entity54			2
at the other end of the soap map , @entity38 will soon be seen charging through @entity57 ; the actress is to play @entity60 's new love interest , @entity61 , in the long - running series			1
mum - of - one @entity38 admitted that she 'd previously turned down offers from the soap , firstly because of other work commitments and then because she was a new mum and did n't want the often gruelling schedule that comes with a soap contract			1
@entity32 and @entity38 are n't the only names to sign on the dotted line for soaps at an interesting stage in their careers			1
two days ago , celebrated stage actress and 70s child star @entity75 announced that she will also take a new role in @entity19 , playing the role of @entity79			0
we know lots about the stars who 've carved out successful careers after leaving soap operas ; @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and even @entity90 ... but there 's also a growing list of faces who you might not have expected to see mucking out the stables in @entity21 or pulling a pint behind the @entity98			1
a healthy career ( left , pictured in @entity100 ) was n't helped by comments @entity102 made about the september 11th terror attacks and some dubious remarks in a lad 's mag. when @entity19 came knocking in 2013 , he promptly signed up and has n't looked back ( pictured right with co-star @entity107 ) @entity102 @entity108 actor @entity102 was seen as a big - name signing when he agreed to play @entity110 , a new landlord at the @entity98 in @entity19			1
after starring in films such as @entity112 and @entity100 , the actor had seen his career soar and was even cast by leading @entity115 playwright @entity114 in two of his plays and then took a starring role in an adaptation of another , @entity121 , in 2008			0
his famously loose tongue saw @entity102 's popularity plummet somewhat though after he made controversial comments about the 9/11 terror attacks and offered some dubious advice in lad 's mag zoo			1
the star turned down the offer of @entity19 in 2009 but after finally accepting in 2013 has n't looked back			2
the cockney rebel even bagged the @entity132 at the @entity133 earlier this year			0
more @entity134 than the @entity135 ... but @entity136 made a huge success of her stint in @entity21 , playing superbitch @entity139 @entity136 the @entity142 moors might have been the last place that you 'd expect to find @entity136 but in 2004 , the actress announced that she 'd been tempted north by the role of soap villain @entity139			1
despite a glamourous life that had seen marriages to rock stars @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 and a set of celebrity friends , @entity136 was anything but afraid of heading to the countryside to get her acting career back on track			1
she later said of the role : ' the one great thing about being an actress is i love playing different characters and i was really blessed with @entity139			0
' ' she was this total bitch and the writing was incredible			0
i worked with a brilliant cast and i learnt so much from them			0
' actress @entity169 left @entity19 in 1998 after a decade of playing @entity170 ... only to make the leap to rival soap @entity20 after a period of stage and screen work in 2011 @entity169 for ten years , @entity169 caused chaos in @entity57 as evil @entity170			1
when she was written out in 1998 , a series of high profile drama roles followed including @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
the lure of soapland proved too strong though and by 2011 , @entity169 had ditched less reliable stage and screen work in favour of a regular spot on rival soap @entity20			2
playing the landlady of the @entity190 , @entity169 stayed until 2014 when she left amid rumours that she was unhappy with the lack of screen time that her character was being afforded			0
the carry on films ensured @entity107 was a household name but her career was reborn when she was cast alongside @entity200 and @entity201 in @entity19 in 1994 @entity107 in possibly the most perfect piece of casting ever performed in soapland , @entity19 snapped up national treasure @entity107 just as her star was fading			2
the actress , made famous for her saucy antics in the carry on films , had seen bigger theatrical roles all up but dry up by the time @entity19 tapped on her agent 's door			0
@entity212 was born and @entity107 was the perfect foil to rugged eggheads @entity214 and @entity216			2
the actress stayed in the role for sixteen years , signing in 1994 and leaving in 2010			0
now elevated to soap royalty , she 's contracted to appear in one episode a year			0
@entity19 put @entity107 back in the spotlight and other roles followed ; next year she is set to reprise the role of @entity224 in @entity226 's sequel to his 2010 @entity228 film			2
a love affair with the soaps : @entity231 , who has admitted to having a tough year and was even spotted working in a friend 's pub , will soon return to the set of @entity236 's @entity235 @entity231 after much publicised struggles with sobriety , @entity231 is heading back to her soap roots , after recently informing fans that she plans to return to @entity235			2
the star confirmed her return as former jailbird @entity243 on the @entity236 show , bringing to an end a difficult 12 - month period during which she lost her family home and returned to rehab			0
@entity231 , who was cast as @entity212 's daughter @entity251 in @entity19 when she was just 16 , famously battled a cocaine addiction which forced her septum , the bridge under the nose , to collapse			0
in recent years , the actress has appeared on reality television and even had a stint in @entity259 but will be relieved to back in the bosom of @entity10 soap .			1

@entity32 and @entity38 are the latest big - name signings to agree to contracts with @entity10 soap operas
they join a long line of stars who 've looked to soaps to boost their careers
@entity107 , @entity136 and @entity102 all saw their profiles rise after taking to the small screen
