@entity1 's awful start to the campaign took another terrible turn after an embarrassing 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity5 to exit the @entity6			1
the managerless pre-season promotion favourites , who have won just two championship games and sit in 17th , were second best throughout the 90 minutes and were lucky not to have lost by a heavier margin			1
@entity11 scored either side of @entity14 ' left - footed drive within 35 minutes as the @entity15 picked off the hapless home side at will			1
@entity11 could have had a hat - trick had it not been for an offside flag while @entity19 thundered a late effort off the crossbar			2
@entity11 gives @entity5 the lead against @entity1 former @entity23 midfielder @entity11 celebrates with his @entity5 team - mates it was a tough day at the office for joint caretaker boss @entity27 what began as a dream evening for @entity30 quickly turned into the stuff of nightmares for the joint - caretaker boss			1
with @entity27 prowling the touchline , @entity30 named himself in what could turn out to be the pair 's only team sheet on home soil as @entity1 managers			1
in doing so , the centre - back gave himself a second @entity43 debut having returned to his cherished boyhood club last month			0
his inclusion was one of eight changes to the starting line - up but there was no place for tuesday afternoon 's loan signing @entity53 , cup - tied having appeared in this competition for @entity46			0
but right from the first whistle there was scant sense this would be the morale - boosting victory that the majority of the sparse 6,000 crowd craved			0
@entity63 fired a warning sign at @entity65 after just eight minutes and seconds later the game 's first goal arrived as @entity11 was allowed space to bend a low right - footed shot into the bottom corner			2
@entity1 joint caretaker boss @entity30 could n't turn things around on the pitch @entity14 ' clinical strike doubled @entity5 's advantage @entity14 celebrates doubling the @entity15 ' advantage @entity11 is delighted after making it 3 - 0 to @entity5 @entity5 's classy midfielders were dictating the game and it was no surprise when they cut open the @entity1 rearguard with ease again in the 22nd minute when @entity83 's defence - splitting through - ball was lashed into the far corner by @entity14			1
only an offside flag then stopped @entity30 's first start of 2014/15 hitting a new low			0
the 35 - year - old was caught in possession on the edge of his own box and was a relieved man to see @entity63 flagged as he went to roll in @entity11 for a third			2
former @entity93 man @entity11 would only have to wait eight minutes for his second goal of the evening , the midfielder firing through a crowd of red shirts after @entity65 could only push @entity63 's curling effort into his path			2
that was enough for @entity27 who hauled off @entity101 and @entity102 with just 36 minutes on the clock and their withdrawals did have a impact before the home side were booed off the pitch			0
@entity109 blazed over the bar after @entity112 's shot was well saved by @entity5 's @entity115 loanee @entity113 and the @entity116 then pulled off a stunning save to claw out @entity118 's hooked effort on the stroke of half - time			0
@entity5 boss @entity121 applauds the visiting fans @entity123 of @entity5 and @entity1 's @entity124 get stuck in @entity109 's clever finish six minutes after the break , after @entity128 's fine cross , was ruled out for offside and that was as close as @entity1 came			1
with 10 minutes to go @entity5 were only a lick of paint away from another			0
@entity19 , scorer of a memorable long - range effort on saturday , almost grabbed his second stunning strike in four days only for his fizzing effort to bounce back off the underside of the crossbar			0
a minute later @entity1 needed @entity30 to clear two efforts off his own line to deny @entity5 , in what was certainly not the end to the evening the caretaker boss would have envisaged .			1

@entity145 3 - 0 down within *33* minutes
a @entity11 double and one from @entity14 did the *damage* to see @entity149 rivals @entity5 into round four
@entity27 and @entity30 take joint caretaker charge
@entity1 have only won two championship games all season
@entity159 boss @entity158 favourite to take over from departed @entity160
