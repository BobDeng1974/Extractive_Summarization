@entity0 might want to look up that old saying about houses built on sand			2
it might just ring a @entity6 bell or two regarding a side who are reasonably capable of scoring but need some pointers on how to defend			2
that much was obvious here in a performance of numerous back - line errors that had to be redeemed by goals 85 minutes apart			2
leading after four minutes through @entity17 , @entity16 spent large swathes of what remained hanging on			1
had @entity21 made more of the space he was repeatedly afforded by @entity23 , this might have been a different result altogether			1
@entity16 midfielder @entity24 celebrates scoring an 89th - minute winner at the @entity26 against @entity27 @entity16 's @entity17 ( left ) , @entity24 ( centre ) and @entity29 ( right ) celebrate their 89th - minute winner on sunday @entity24 ( left ) scores a late winner for @entity16 as they took all three points away from the @entity26 @entity27 's ( from left ) @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 look devastated after conceding late on @entity17 clinches his first in celebration after putting @entity16 1 - 0 ahead against @entity27 at the @entity26 @entity17 ( centre ) leaps above the @entity27 defence to power a header into the back of the net in just the fourth minute of the game the @entity16 forward clenches his fist in celebration and runs off into the corner after opening the scoring on sunday @entity17 ( centre , obscured ) is congratulated by team - mates after opening the scoring at the @entity26 on sunday instead , @entity21 scored only once and @entity16 rode a @entity27 storm until @entity24 picked their pocket at the other end			1
as @entity27 manager @entity56 put it : ‘ it would have been stopped in the second half if it was a boxing match			1
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , was asked if there was a @entity60 phrase for ‘ smash and grab ’ , but he did n’t understand the question			2
instead he focused on the ‘ positives ’ , which in this case meant a first win in three league games and a tribute to the team ’s spirit			2
certainly , there was no shortage of application from @entity16 ’s players when the going got tough and that has not always been the case in this strange season			1

it was a difficult game because @entity27 are a very good team			1
it is important to show character and fight			2
it was a very , very important win because @entity27 have very good players			1
’ he added : ‘ in football , sometimes you deserve it and sometimes not			2
i think we deserved it because we scored			0
sometimes in the last few games , we deserved more but did n’t score			0
’ @entity56 was not nearly so philosophical , lamenting the lack of clinical finishing up front and the errors from @entity79 and @entity80 that led to @entity16 ’s two goals			1
he said : ‘ it ’s sickening			0
i could n’t see that coming , to be honest			0
two individual errors cost us two goals and the result			0
we created enough chances to score a number of goals and did n’t do it			0
‘ we gifted them the first and the second half it was one way until we made another mistake for the @entity167 the second half they were hanging on			0
that is when you have to kill people			0
you have to be ruthless			0
’ of those errors , the first came inside four minutes			1
the origins were questionable , a debatable foul given against @entity85 on @entity27 ’s left from which @entity16 won a corner			1
@entity24 delivered the cross and @entity17 headed his 10th goal of the season			1
a fine tally , certainly , but helped generously in this instance by some flat - footed marking from @entity79 , who was similarly lacking in defeat against @entity183 last week			0
the retaliation started soon after and @entity0 ought to be concerned about the opportunities his side gave up			0
there ’s no doubt that @entity21 ’s movement has improved this season , but a man of his build should not find it so easy to escape detection from centre halves			1
at times , @entity23 and @entity29 were clueless in plotting his location			0
@entity17 ( second left ) jumps highest and directs his header into the back of the @entity27 net after only four minutes the @entity16 striker scores ( left ) and runs off in celebration ( right ) as @entity27 keeper @entity78 kneels down a view from behind the goal as @entity17 jumps highest to head home the opening goal after only four minutes at the @entity26 @entity21 ( right ) sees his close - range opportunity saved by @entity16 goalkeeper @entity95 on sunday video sometimes you do n't deserve to win - @entity0 @entity27 boss @entity56 ( left ) and @entity16 manager @entity0 ( right ) argues while the rain lashes down @entity209 ( left ) gestures towards the pitch as @entity0 holds his arms out and expresses his surprise @entity16 forward @entity17 ( bottom ) slides across the floor after a challenge from @entity27 's @entity85 ( centre ) @entity85 ( right ) of @entity27 pushes his arm out to try and hold off the challenge of @entity16 midfielder @entity102 @entity27 's @entity84 ( right ) screams out loud and flies up in the air after a challenge from @entity16 ' @entity29 mins @entity221 @entity27 total 114.1 70.9 @entity35 90 12.5 7.8 @entity222 90 11.9 7.4 @entity84 90 11.4 7.1 @entity16 total 123.8 76.9 @entity24 90 13.2 8.2 @entity17 90 13.1 8.2 @entity101 90 11.9 7.4 data courtesy of the @entity224 , the @entity225 of the @entity118 the first sign came on nine minutes when the @entity227 turned inside @entity23 and drew a good save from @entity95			1
@entity21 then got away from @entity97 to meet a superb through - ball from @entity85			1
the striker was clean through but @entity98 ’s slide tackle was a perfect mixture of timing and technique			0
the left - back tussle with @entity236 looks to have been won			0
@entity21 was twice more given space to threaten and @entity35 had a shout for a penalty ignored after an apparent foul by @entity23			1
@entity56 said : ‘ i asked the fourth official if their player touched the ball			0
i do n’t think he did			0
’ spurs were living dangerously and the pressure told soon after the break			2
again , @entity23 was guilty of allowing @entity21 to meet @entity84 ’s cross eight yards out			2
the initial shot came back off @entity23 and @entity21 buried the rebound for his eighth of the campaign			1
from there , @entity35 dragged a low shot wide , while @entity36 and @entity85 also went close			2
@entity17 glanced a header within a foot of the far post after an @entity24 corner , but @entity16 were mostly countering rather than setting a pace			1
@entity80 made a hash of a clearance in the 89th minute , @entity98 squared and @entity24 finished from the edge of the area			1
‘ @entity265 is still young — 22 years old , ’ @entity0 said			0
‘ it is his second season in @entity268 and he is a big talent and a very key player for us			0
’ that much is not in doubt			0
it ’s what happens a little further back that ought to be the concern			0
@entity21 gestures as he runs off in celebration after equalising for @entity27 against @entity16 at the @entity26 the striker ( left ) curls the ball around @entity16 defender @entity23 and into the back of the net to level up the scores @entity84 ( left ) and @entity83 ( right ) of @entity27 celebrate with @entity21 after the latter 's equaliser @entity21 ( centre ) points to the ground in celebration as he runs off after scoring in the 48th minute against @entity16 @entity21 ( right ) runs with the ball as @entity16 's @entity98 tries to get around the outside to make a sliding challenge @entity84 attempts to shoot towards the @entity16 goal but can only connect with his shin as the ball flies wide @entity96 ( left ) of @entity16 and @entity27 's @entity82 push each other as they run to compete for the ball on sunday @entity24 ( right ) curls in the winner for @entity16 as @entity16 left the @entity26 with all three points on sunday @entity16 's @entity24 points to the sky as he runs off in celebration having netted an 89th - minute winner for the visitors @entity35 ( centre ) looks to the ground in disappointment after @entity27 conceded an 89th - minute goal to lose the match @entity310 ( right ) celebrates with @entity24 after the latter 's late goal gave @entity16 all three points on sunday @entity83 ( right ) has his shirt held and pulled by @entity314 as the both try and compete for the ball at the @entity26 @entity35 ( centre ) of @entity27 tries to evade the challenge of five @entity16 players as he faces his former side on sunday @entity36 of @entity27 ( right ) sees his challenge blocked by @entity310 during the second - half at the @entity26 a man dressed as @entity323 carries a goal post off the pitch at the @entity26 during half - time of the @entity118 match @entity27 boss @entity56 ( left ) and @entity16 manager @entity0 ( right ) embrace before the start of the match at the @entity26			1

@entity24 scores late winner for @entity16 with a shot from just inside the penalty area
