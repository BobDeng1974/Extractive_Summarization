at the age of 11 , blonde - haired , blue - eyed twins @entity2 and @entity3 formed a band and saw themselves as the new faces of pop music			1
but instead , the girls from @entity9 , @entity10 , would soon be labelled the ' new faces of hate '			1
not surprising when you consider the group they created in 2003 was a neo-nazi outfit called @entity3 - named after a by - product of the poison used to gas millions of @entity19 in the @entity20 - at the suggestion of @entity23 leader @entity22			1
now however , at the age of 20 , the twins have radically transformed themselves from hate - spouting extremists to peace - loving hippies			1
and the reason for their change ? marijuana			1
@entity2 and @entity3 , seen here in @entity31 , have abandoned their racist beliefs and have become ' pretty liberal ' ... with the aid of medical marijuana the sisters , pictured in 2005 , formed a pop band called @entity3 , at the suggestion of @entity23 leader @entity22			1
it was named after a by - product of the poison used to gas millions of @entity19 in the @entity20 the girls , who once wore smiley - face @entity43 t - shirts , both now have medical marijuana cards , consider themselves ' healers ' and say they are ' pretty liberal now '			1
' i ’m stoked that we have so many different cultures , ' @entity49 said			2
' i think it ’s amazing and it makes me proud of humanity every day that we have so many different places and people			2
' @entity49 was diagnosed with cancer during her freshman year of high school , when doctors removed a tumour from her shoulder			1
she was prescribed oxycontin and morphine to deal with the pain			1
she also suffers from a rare condition called cyclic vomiting syndrome			2
about two years ago , she began smoking to ease withdrawal symptoms and nausea			2
' i have to say , marijuana saved my life , ' she said			1
' i would probably be dead if i did n’t have it			2
' @entity2 , who suffers from scoliosis and chronic back pain , leading to emotional stress , soon acquired a medical marijuana card of her own			1
they said the drug has reignited their creativity , which they now channel in other ways , such as painting			2
' we just want to come from a place of love and light , ' @entity2 said , adding , ' i think we ’re meant to do something more - we ’re healers			1
we just want to exert the most love and positivity we can			2
' ' i 'm glad we were in a band , but i think we should have been pushed toward something a little more mainstream and easier for us to handle than being front - men for a belief system that we did n't completely understand at the time , ' @entity49 told the @entity99			1
it is certainly a change of philosophy for the girls who were raised in a redneck community , where they were indoctrinated in extremist principles			1
their grandfather , @entity106 , had a swastika on his belt buckle , painted it on his truck and even branded his cattle with the @entity113 symbol			1
such was their notoriety that they featured in a @entity118 documentary about @entity119 in 2003			1
pictured above , @entity49 ( left ) , mother april and @entity2 , with louis but they blame his daughter , their mother april , for being the main influence on their skewed perspective			2
as a member of racist fringe groups such as the @entity130 and the @entity131 , she had a powerful hold over her children			0
by the time the twins were 13 , in 2006 , they had recorded a roster of songs that were infuriating the nation , with titles including @entity139 and hate for hate : @entity141 , co-written by @entity142 - the late member of terrorist group @entity145 and @entity2 's then pen - pal			1
@entity142 was ten serving 190 years in prison for his involvement in the murder of @entity19 talk show host @entity149 in 1984			0
soon after the song 's release , the girls were labelled by the media ' the new faces of hate ' , fuelling the firestorm with their angelic faces and smiley - faced @entity43 t - shirts			1
' @entity43 was a great man who was only trying to preserve his own race in his own country , ' @entity2 said at the time			0
' @entity43 was a great man who was only trying to preserve his own race in his own country ' - @entity3 , 2006 the young teen @entity49 added : ' lots of things were exaggerated about the @entity165			1
we do n't believe that 6million @entity19 were executed			0
i mean , there were not even that many @entity19 alive then			0
' we know there were concentration camps but they had swimming pools and tennis courts - that 's not how you would treat people if you were getting ready to kill them			1
' in 2005 , they donated money to victims of @entity179 but insisted it go to whites only			0
such was their notoriety that they featured in a @entity118 documentary about @entity119 in 2003			1
the sisters now say , however , they simply did n't know better			0
@entity49 , a painter and furniture restorer who still lives at home with her mother , said : ' my sister and i were home - schooled			2
we were these country bumpkins			0
we spent most of our days up on the hill playing with our goats			0
' @entity2 , now a hotel maid who lives nearby , echoed : ' i was just spouting a lot of knowledge that i had no idea what i was saying			0
their mother , however , still defends encouraging the extremist side project			0
' i thought it would just be a little fun thing to do , ' she said , adding , ' i did n’t expect it to get as big as it did			0
if the girls feel regretful about it , i guess i would have to as well			2
' @entity2 and @entity49 said enrolling in public school and moving to northwest @entity31 has helped them become more open - minded			2
however , they said their mother still has dreams of forming an ' intentional ' white community in @entity31 , called @entity217			0
but they are reluctant to follow her lead			0
' i ’m not a white nationalist anymore , ' @entity2 said			0
' my sister and i are pretty liberal now			1
' the sisters closed the door with @entity3 following the band 's 2006 @entity225 tour , and have spent the last few years ' lying low and trying to live a normal life , ' @entity2 said			0
they do worry about a backlash from their former fans			0
' there are dangerous people in @entity23 that do n’t give a f * * * , and they would do awful things to people who they think betrayed the movement , ' @entity2 said , adding , ' we ’re stepping on eggshells			0
' the sisters are not completely reformed , however			0
asked whether the @entity20 happened , @entity49 replied , ' i think certain things happened			1
i think a lot of the stories got misconstrued			0
i mean , yeah , @entity43 was n't the best , but @entity244 was n't , @entity243 was n't			0
i disagree with everybody at that time			0
' @entity2 added : ' i just think everyone needs to frickin ' get over it			0
that 's what i think			0

@entity106 girls *sparked* outrage with their pop group , formed in 2003
20 - year - olds , who were @entity20 *deniers* , are ' pretty liberal now '
both have been prescribed medical marijuana for various conditions
