for a girl born into a council semi in @entity3 , you can understand why @entity4 — @entity4 , @entity5 of @entity6 to be precise — does n’t want to let go of @entity8 ’s @entity7 , her @entity10 home for the past three years			1
its seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms ( the master en suite has his - and - hers bathtubs ) have marble floors			0
there is a cinema , games room , and an arts and crafts room			0
the house , in @entity23 , is surrounded by a pool and a lake and rose gardens			2
@entity28 ’s @entity27 is a neighbour			0
battle : @entity6 ( pictured left with lord @entity6 before their bitter divorce in 2012 , is taking the lover she left him for , @entity32 ( right ) , to court claiming she was wrongly evicted from a @entity10 mansion @entity4 ’s problem is that the owner of the beautiful estate , pharmaceutical tycoon dr @entity32 , for whom she left the hapless @entity41 in 2010 , is selling it from under her and has served her with an eviction notice			1
he has placed it on the market for just over £ 8 million , and has given her 60 days to leave			1
@entity6 — born @entity46 , daughter of a @entity48 tool - maker — is responding with the kind of defiance her previous husband knows only too well			1
although she and dr @entity32 were never married , she is claiming ownership of the estate , based on intimate emails he sent her while they were together			1
the 6ft 4in @entity41 — @entity58 to his friends — had to fight hard to restrict his own divorce settlement with her to £ 17 million , and that was despite her beginning an affair with one of his friends			1
she and the @entity41 had been married for nearly 20 years			0
‘ she got £ 850,000 for each year of their marriage , ’ snaps one of his close chums			2
lavish : @entity6 returned to @entity73 , @entity74 , in march to find an eviction notice at 62 , @entity4 is still something of a temptress			1
like the @entity79 ’s mother , @entity80 , @entity4 — mela to her friends — started out as an air stewardess			0
before dr @entity32 came along , she had been married three times			1
she wed a @entity87 businessman when she was 18 , and then a wealthy @entity90 - @entity89 shipping financier when she was 31			0
when that marriage ended in the @entity93 , her property interests began			2
she was left with the £ 2 million marital apartment near the @entity95 in @entity96 , which today would be worth in the region of £ 20 million			2
now @entity4 , who has no children , has filed a ferocious legal claim on the @entity23 property , into which she was moved by dr @entity32 in december 2010 after @entity101 ordered her out of his magnificent home , the 84 - room @entity104 mansion @entity105 , in @entity106			1
she swiftly returned with removal vans to take her things , say friends of the @entity41 , and took the opportunity to have the artworks hanging on the walls photographed for valuation through her solicitors			0
@entity4 ’s claim to @entity8 ’s @entity7 is based on what she says are promises from dr @entity32 that the estate would be hers for ever			1
in documents lodged at the @entity122 in @entity74 , she claims he promised that she ‘ would reside there and that @entity125 [ @entity8 ’s @entity7 ] together with all furniture and furnishings would belong to her ’			1
she quotes a series of affectionate emails from him , for example : ‘ thank you so much for giving me back my soul and my life , nothing i ’ll do in the future will ever compensate that ! ’ and : ‘ do not worry a bit about money , as i ’ll support you all the way , my beloved			0
’ certainly no one foresaw such an acrimonious ending to what had been an affair of unusual passion and secrecy			1
the slender honey - blonde had become @entity58 ’s fifth wife at a register office wedding in @entity151 before christmas 1990			0
dubbed the ‘ @entity155 ’ because of his fascination with spirituality and @entity154 , he ’d been introduced to @entity4 at a party by friends			0
they married within months and he declared : ‘ she is the centre of my life			0
i call her “ @entity164 — @entity165 ”			0
she is a healer , very good at relaxing me			0
’ perhaps they might still have been married had they not met @entity32 at a @entity154 convention in @entity169 in 2006			1
worth £ 200 million , the balding scientist and entrepreneur was soon invited to @entity105			2
the couple were both intrigued by dr @entity32 , whose main home was by @entity175 in @entity176 , because of his ‘ transhumanist ’ beliefs — the conviction that technology can overcome human limitations			1
he was interested in immortality and anti-ageing therapies , convinced that life can be ‘ extended through nano - technology and artificial intelligence ’			0
he told the couple he was only the second person ever to have his genome mapped — charting a body ’s dna and genetic make - up — at a cost of £ 220,000 and generously paid double that for both of the @entity195 to go through the process at a clinic in the @entity89 the divorced father - of - one , whose fortune came from cancer care products , was also generous to @entity4 ’s father @entity201 , buying him a £ 1,300 bottle of wine from @entity204 and a @entity206 watch			1
but in 2009 , the @entity41 began to suspect that his wife was having an affair with the @entity209			2
@entity4 had been to @entity210 for meetings with dr @entity32 — he had made her president of one of his pharmaceutical companies			1
on her return to @entity105 , @entity58 noticed that she was not wearing her wedding ring			0
her explanation was that during the flight her fingers had swollen and she ’d had the band cut off			0
her trips abroad became more frequent , and @entity58 realised that she now possessed a @entity224 gold and diamond necklace			0
in fact this was just one of several pieces of jewellery that @entity4 , then 58 , had been bought by her lover			2
the affair was finally exposed when lord @entity6 was given tapes of phone conversations between his wife and her father @entity201 , now 89			1
they had been secretly recorded by @entity201 ’s then partner @entity238 , who was fond of @entity58 and upset at @entity4 ’s deceit			0
the @entity41 was heartbroken and threw his wife out			0
their divorce dispute over a financial pay - off was heading for the @entity243 when the settlement of £ 17 million was arranged just over a year ago			1
they have never met since			0
but just as he was being named in court as @entity6 ’s lover , dr @entity32 , 62 , was embarking on another affair behind her back			1
by late 2012 he was married to @entity253 , 50 , from @entity254 in the @entity255			2
unsurprisingly , some of @entity58 ’s friends can hardly conceal their glee at the break - up of @entity4 ’s relationship with dr @entity32			1
‘ after what she did to @entity58 , i ca n’t pretend i wanted her to live happily ever after , ’ one admits			0
‘ but she is tough , and @entity32 is in for a fight			1
’ @entity266 hat certainly seems to be the case			0
in her affidavit , @entity4 is not only claiming that the ownership of the @entity23 house and its contents should be transferred to her , but is also claiming $ 10 million ( £ 6 million ) ‘ special damages ’ , representing the value of other property and the financial support that was allegedly promised but not paid			1
she is also seeking general damages of $ 25,000 ( £ 14,600 ) for her ‘ severe emotional distress			2
anxiety , sleeplessness , depression and humiliation ’			0
she maintains @entity32 ‘ verbally promised ’ her that he would transfer the property into her name once her divorce was final			1
in the court papers , she produces an email from @entity32 dated june 22 , 2012 , which says : ‘			1
right now , the only thing i can tell you is that @entity125 is yours and will remain yours for ever , and i ’ll do all the paperwork needed to provide you with security			0
’ other emails are documented to show what she claims was the depth of their relationship			2
‘ your honesty and beautiful mind and warm , good vibes can only mean shared fulfilment of these crazy objectives , ’ she quotes him as saying			0
the papers also disclose how @entity32 had promised to keep her in the style to which she had become accustomed , including £ 30,000 a month to cover her ‘ personal girlish stuff ’			1
@entity4 has added one additional and highly personal reason why she does not want to leave the estate			2
she scattered her mother ’s ashes there			0
this means , she claims , she has a ‘ personal , emotional and permanent ’ investment in it			2
in a counter-claim , dr @entity32 insists @entity6 has no ‘ enforceable contract supporting her claim ’ beyond a memorandum which outlines a number of options for the future of the @entity331 remains at the disputed property , while dr @entity32 is dividing his time between his home near @entity175 , a skiing lodge in @entity322 and a house in @entity324			1
lord @entity6 , a mere spectator to this domestic wrangling , is reluctant to say much but told us : ‘ it does n’t surprise me that this is going on			1
’ his friends are less restrained			0
‘ @entity4 is one of the most diabolical bitches i have had the misfortune of knowing , ’ says one			0
‘ there ’s no sympathy for either her or @entity32			1
’ since the divorce , the ever - optimistic @entity58 has married for a sixth time , to psychotherapist @entity346			2
‘ i am very happy now with a very special person , ’ he says			0
as for his colourful ex-wife — well , she is very much available , should the right man come along			0
@entity350 : dr @entity351 bought the lavish property in 2010			2
his lawyers have claimed @entity6 has no evidence to back claims their client told her she would sign over the house estate : her ex-husband is one of the richest men in @entity363 with a fortune of around £ 120million , including two country houses			1

@entity6 , 62 , had 60 days to leave the @entity10 property in march
claims lover @entity32 promised to sign the house in her name
their affair prompted an acrimonious divorce battle in @entity243 in 2012
lord @entity6 has a fortune of £ 120m , including two country estates
