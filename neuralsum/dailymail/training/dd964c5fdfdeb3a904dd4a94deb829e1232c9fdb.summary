few gave the marriage between the socialite daughter of a disgraced @entity3 minister and a @entity7 ‘ warrior ’ much chance of success			1
but confirmation that the union between @entity10 and @entity11 is indeed over has been overshadowed by claims from her controversial father that it was never a real marriage at all			2
@entity10 , 34 , was best known as a party - loving socialite before becoming a @entity7 and marrying an @entity19 law graduate she spotted at a temple			1
socialite @entity10 's marriage to her @entity7 ‘ warrior ’ husband @entity11 appears to be over the unlikely couple wed near the @entity7 holy city of @entity27 in 2010 and three years later their relationship was reported to be on the rocks			1
now former mp @entity31 has spoken about his daughter ’s ‘ marriage ’ and stirred up controversy which is unlikely to go down well in his daughter ’s adopted home			1
speaking last week , mr @entity31 said : ‘ they were not married and they are now detached			1
‘ it was more a colourful , folklore ceremony than a proper ceremony			0
i think both sides know the marriage is over , if it ever was a marriage			0
their position is they are not married			0
’ mr @entity31 , 72 , who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice , said his daughter remains in @entity19 , enjoying life as a follower of the @entity7 religion			1
he added : ‘ she has a devout , happy life near @entity27 living as a @entity7 and is supported by her parents			1
’ @entity10 's father , former mp @entity31 , who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice , said : ‘ they were not married and they are now detached ' @entity10 was known for being a party - loving socialite before becoming a @entity7 and marrying an @entity19 law graduate she spotted at a temple after years being photographed outside nightclubs and doing modelling work , @entity10 ’s sudden conversion and love story shocked many close to her			1
the couple ’s marriage was attended by more than 300 people at dawn – the holiest time of day in the @entity7 religion			2
extra blessings are said to come to couples who get married just before sunrise			0
under @entity19 law the ceremony – called @entity77 – is legal under legislation passed by an act of parliament			2
perhaps mr @entity31 ’s doubts stem from his absence from the ceremony in october 2010			1
the bride ’s twin sister @entity84 was there but she was sworn to secrecy and her parents were n’t told until later			0
@entity10 had moved to @entity27 in northern @entity19 after apparently having a dream about a @entity7 who would change her life			1
she noticed her future husband at the @entity93 and spent a week beside him without exchanging a single word			0
she later said she knew she was ‘ blindly in love ’ and returned to the city a few weeks later to be introduced to him			2
@entity10 rapidly adopted @entity7 traditions , refusing to cut her hair or even wax her eyebrows , using only a wooden comb and carrying a ceremonial knife			2
recalling the moment she first saw her future husband , she said : ‘ i was sitting on the roof of the @entity93 at about 3am , and the most beautiful man i ’d ever seen in my whole life walked in			0
‘ he seemed 100 per cent man , gentle and intuitive and poetic and sensitive , but also extraordinarily strong and manly			0
‘ and you do n’t see many of these around			0
so i was like : “ oh wow ! ” ’ speaking about how her father took news of the marriage , she said in an interview : ‘ when i said , “ @entity115 , i might be wearing a turban next time you see me ” , it was a bit of a shock			0
‘ but my father loves my husband - it ’s impossible not to			0
he ’s happy for us			0
