by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 12 february 2013 @entity2 : 11:35 est , 12 february 2013 choosing a @entity4 gift is always a fraught affair - but it looks like it might just be about to get easier			1
while most men could be forgiven for assuming that their other halves want to be spoilt with jewellery come thursday , a new survey has revealed that all women really want for @entity4 is a hug			1
given the choice , nine in ten women would choose a thoughtful , romantic gesture over a luxury gift of diamonds			1
hug me tender : for most women , a big cuddle is at the top of their @entity4 wishlist while many men believe jewellery and lingerie is the way to a woman 's heart , most women would be happy with something that costs nothing such as a loving cuddle or a handwritten @entity36 study found that a quarter of women would like their partner to write them a romantic poem , while eight per cent are hoping for a passionate embrace			1
but not every woman will be satisfied with a humble hug			2

@entity47 retail director , @entity49 , said : ' this survey shows you do n't have to spend large sums of money to woo your other half this @entity4			2
' in fact , romantic gestures like writing a love note or even just a hug can make your partner 's day			2
' bye bye bling : diamonds it seems are n't a girl 's best friend , as more women would prefer poems to jewels words of love : both model @entity71 and presenter @entity72 ( right ) are taking part in the @entity47 's @entity75 campaign the research was carried out as part of the @entity47 's annual @entity79 fundraising campaign			2

but although male a-listers seemed to understand the power of a romantic gesture - step forward @entity81 - real men have n't quite gotten there yet			1
according to the survey , one in ten believe that cooking dinner is the way to a woman 's heart , while a similar number thought that expensive jewellery or a day out shopping were guaranteed brownie point bankers			0
nearly one in ten men ( nine per cent ) believe lingerie is the best gift , despite the fact that just one per cent of women agree			1
interestingly , five per cent think that doing the housework is the most romantic gesture they could possibly make , while another two per cent astonishingly thought that not watching sport all weekend would do the trick for their other half			1
he 's not known for his erudite wit or expert grasp of grammar but at least @entity81 does know how to write a love letter from the heart			0
his short note might be brief but it does n't look like girlfriend @entity122 will complaining anytime soon			0
@entity82 , meanwhile , addresses hers to her beloved dog , @entity127			0
