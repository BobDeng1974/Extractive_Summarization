by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 the @entity3 will thunder back into action at the home of the champions on friday night , armed with an emphatic endorsement from a @entity8 among the cast - list of new recruits			1
‘ i think it ’s the best league in the world , ’ said @entity12 hooker @entity11 , following his summer move from the @entity14			1
he may just have a point			0
while the @entity3 lacks the glitz of @entity23 ’s money - laden @entity21 league , awash with @entity24 , it is a competition of compelling substance ; fierce and tribal			1
acclaiming it as the best league is a bold call but perhaps the right one			0
across the @entity31 , leading @entity30 sides rest star players away from home , thus damaging the credibility of their event			0
and the notion of ‘ @entity23 flair ’ is a remote fantasy amid the earthy tussle for the ‘ @entity40 ’			1
player to watch : @entity11 is a world - class hooker who will add ballast to the @entity12 pack title to defend : @entity46 boss @entity45 will be hoping to get off to a winning start on friday night in the far - flung south , the @entity48 is a swashbuckling exhibition of attacking arts , but that is a cross-border extraganza and one now mired in a bewildering format and dubious expansionism			1
when it comes to national leagues , the @entity56 in @entity57 and the @entity58 in @entity59 primarily serve as breeding grounds for emerging talent			0
closer to home , the @entity64 has struggled for identity within four nations , while also hampered by @entity69 rotation policies and an exodus from the @entity8 regions , not to mention endlessly shifting kick - off times and meagre attendances			0
so the @entity3 may well be worthy of @entity11 ’s tribute and this promises to be an especially spicy season – possibly a watershed too			1
what has been lacking for some years is the bums - on - seats impact of @entity82 clubs managing to acquire ‘ a ’ - list outsiders to dazzle the viewing public			0
they flocked here in years past , before the @entity23 acquired enough financial clout to chase ‘ @entity90 ’ out of rugby ’s transfer market			2
the imminent arrival of @entity92 at @entity93 will serve as an antidote and provide a sideshow for the remainder of the campaign , as the titan of rugby league attempts to master the rival code with sufficient haste to force his way in to @entity105 contention			1
in fact , players vying for places at the tournament in this country next year will be the main sub-plot of the whole season			2
as sir @entity116 noted in these pages on wednesday , the tussle to win favour with national coach @entity115 will be an absorbing agenda for the rugby public here to observe , but clubs are mindful of promoting their own objectives			0
@entity45 , director of rugby at champions @entity46 , has identified the threat of lost focus , saying : ‘ one challenge is to keep our internationals ’ heads on playing for @entity130 with the @entity105 around the corner			1
’ @entity132 : @entity92 switches codes in november with an eye on claiming a @entity105 spot in truth , the cut and thrust of the weekly contests will keep the @entity105 on the mental back - burner , aside from fleeting thoughts of how early - season form may have a bearing on @entity145 ’s delayed naming of a senior eps squad next month			1
the relentless nature of the domestic season will not allow much time to dream distant dreams , not when the spectre of injury or a collapse in form hangs heavy over the myriad contenders			0
as @entity45 prepares to launch his team ’s title defence , he expressed the familiar view that this is a league where foregone conclusions are a rarity			2
‘ there are no easy games in the @entity3 , home or away , ’ he said			2
‘ if you are not quite there , teams can come and get you			0
’ that is the @entity3 ’s calling card ; how close it is , how tight and tense and unpredictable			2
yet , the @entity130 expect the primary danger to come from @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity93 , as was the case last year			1
@entity12 can be added to that top - end melting pot , because no side with their array of quality players can punch far below their weight for a second successive season			1
champion : @entity181 , a @entity105 winner with all @entity183 pedigree , will be one to watch for @entity8 for all the talk of knife - edge uncertainty , this is a league of haves and have - nots in some ways – just not to the same extent as it is in @entity23			1
while the leading clubs spend the full £ 5million salary cap and attract large crowds , others such as promoted @entity8 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , and @entity194 will resume the quest to expand their support - base and their bank balances			0
there is also a two - tier structure when it comes to the location of @entity206 players			0
the cream continues to rise to the top , leaving the rest to keep bringing young talent through their academies and hope to fend off the bigger spenders for as long as possible			0
the whole landscape may change after this season			0
a home @entity105 potentially could generate a boom , leading to all manner of positive upheaval ; a wider spread of wealth and renewed challenges to the established order – perhaps a salary - cap hike in time			2
@entity105 shout : @entity225 ( right ) could yet make a late charge on @entity115 's squad there is a strong chance that the 2015 tournament may create @entity82 prosperity just as the 2007 edition did in @entity23 , with the knock - on effect of expensive imports returning in droves			1
that in turn would threaten the current status quo of squads filled with home - grown players , that is a distant conundrum			0
for now , it must be hoped that the forthcoming @entity3 season reaches the heights of the last instalment – not least when @entity46 and @entity171 slugged it out in an epic @entity247 at the semi-final stage			1
the @entity105 is fast approaching as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for the sport here , but parochial matters can grab the attention before the global circus begins .			2

@entity3 kicks off on friday night with @entity46 vs @entity12
@entity11 will make his competitive debut for @entity257
next year 's @entity105 will provide *intriguing* *subplot* through season
@entity130 boss @entity45 says @entity105 hopefuls must remain focused
@entity3 faces competition from @entity23 @entity21 and @entity48
