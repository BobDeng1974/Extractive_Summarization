by @entity0 it was supposed to be a high - profile , cheerful celebration of @entity5 ’s best - known star			0
but last week ’s programme to mark @entity7 ’s 25 years with the @entity9 ’s rural affairs series has degenerated into a bitter row – after former presenter @entity11 accused the corporation of ‘ erasing ’ her from the show ’s history			1
ms @entity11 co-hosted @entity5 with mr @entity7 for eight years from 2001			1
but the anniversary programme did not include one shot or mention of her , despite showing dozens of clips from mr @entity7 ’s years on the series			1
former @entity5 presenter @entity20 , who says she was deliberately left out of a tribute to fellow presenter @entity7 she believes that a deliberate decision to exclude her was taken because @entity9 bosses have still not forgiven her for launching a landmark age - discrimination case against the corporation after she was axed from @entity5 in 2009			1
ms @entity11 , now 57 , and three fellow female presenters in their 40s and 50s – @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 – were dropped ahead of the programme leaving its sunday morning slot for a prime time evening slot			2
while the three other presenters went quietly , ms @entity11 took the @entity9 to an employment tribunal and won a case for age discrimination			1
she is believed to have been awarded between £ 100,000 and £ 250,000			0
‘ i am not angry , as i am past that now			0
but i am disappointed , ’ she said after watching the anniversary countryfile			0
‘ i feel i ’ve been erased from the show ’s history			1
it was the @entity9 ’s way of wiping out my contribution because i challenged them at this tribunal			2
‘ i appreciate the show was marking @entity7 ’s 25th anniversary at @entity5 , and he was editing it , but i presented the show with him for eight years and they ’ve left me completely out			1
’ she also pointed out that she worked for the @entity9 for 25 years and has won a number of prestigious awards			1
in last sunday ’s show , the three other female presenters who were axed with ms @entity11 also did not get a mention			0
but the younger presenter hired to replace them in 2009 , @entity56 , now 44 , was shown twice			0
ms @entity11 said she had not intended to watch the anniversary @entity5 , but fans who follow her on @entity61 alerted her to the snub			0
countryfile star @entity7 , far right , who co-hosted the @entity9 programme with ms @entity20 for eight years from 2001 one fan , known as ‘ @entity65 ’ , tweeted : ‘ it ’s not right that you seem to have been erased from its history but @entity9 are good at not mentioning certain things ! ’ another wrote : ‘ catching up with @entity7 ’s 25yr retrospective on @entity73			1
strangely , no @entity11 to be seen ... it was appalling			0
’ speaking from her home in @entity77 , @entity78 , ms @entity11 said she had a ‘ professional and friendly ’ relationship with mr @entity7 , 73 , and does not believe he was responsible for editing her out of the show			1
she believes that it was the work of @entity9 executives who have ‘ blacklisted ’ her			2
‘ i feel they just have not accepted the findings of the tribunal , where judges said that i was discriminated against because of my age , ’ she said			0
‘ publicly they said they accepted its findings , but privately they did not			0
‘ this is why i have been left out			0
it ’s childish and mean , but that ’s how they are			0
’ after her tribunal victory , ms @entity11 was given a three - year contract to work across the @entity9			2
but she terminated her deal two years early after receiving very little work			0
last night the @entity9 denied that ms @entity11 was blacklisted			2
a spokesman said : ‘ sunday ’s @entity5 was a celebratory edition for long - standing presenter @entity7 and included some of his most memorable moments from his 25 years on the show			1
‘ the programme was not intended as a look back at the entire history of @entity5 but purely to mark @entity7 ’s anniversary and his contributions			1
’ mr @entity7 was not available for comment .			2
