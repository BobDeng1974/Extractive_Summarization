along with champions @entity3 and the nationwide - supported @entity5 , the dvd review of @entity2 ’s season was one of the best sellers over the summer			1
why ? there was , of course , the escape from relegation , manager @entity11 describing their four wins from the final five matches as a ‘ miracle ’			1
that run included memorable victories at @entity18 and @entity19			0
it was also a campaign in which @entity2 completed the double over @entity22 rivals @entity23 for the first time since 1967			1
big day out : @entity25 celebrates scoring the opening goal at @entity27 last season in the @entity30 final memories : @entity11 says his side hope to recreate the cup run from last season which inspired league survival but amid all of that was a first cup final appearance at @entity27 in 22 years			1
more than 40,000 fans descended on the capital for the @entity40 final with @entity3			1
and , despite a 3 - 1 defeat , it is that weekend which defined their season and triggered the record dvd sales			2
on wednesday night , at @entity47 side @entity46 , @entity2 begin another @entity40 adventure			1
and given the memory of that march afternoon at @entity27 , @entity11 will be paying this competition the utmost respect			1
strong start : @entity2 picked up a point against @entity5 , and wo n't make many changes ‘ we will be trying to do it again ( make the final ) , ’ said the @entity55			1
‘ normally it 's one final every 20 - plus years , so to do two in a row , you 're asking a lot - but we will try			1
‘ it 's incredible what people have been saying to me			2
they talk more about the game at @entity27 that we lost , than the miracles we won			2
that 's how much it means			2
’ @entity2 ’s run to the final included victories over @entity76 @entity75 , @entity77 and @entity5			1
but they also had to negotiate @entity79 and @entity80 in the earlier rounds			0
and @entity11 – whose side drew 1 - 1 with @entity83 ’s @entity5 in the @entity76 on sunday – will not be making sweeping changes like most top - flight managers			1
he went on : ‘ last year in the beginning we had some nice draws at home			0
i used one game against @entity75 to try something different			0
' then we beat @entity77 in extra-time and we were in the semi-finals			0
when you 're there , you take your chances			0
game time : @entity98 needs and deserves to play on wednesday according to @entity2 boss @entity11 likely to start : @entity99 should also get a game against @entity46 after returning from injury ‘ i can promise you there are not going to be too many changes			1
there will be a few – there are players that need to play			0
@entity98 needs to play and deserves to play			0
' i need to play ( @entity111 ) @entity110 as well because it 's a big competition in there ( the goalkeeping department )			2
@entity99 is back from injury and needs to play			0
‘ so there 's going to be three or four ( changes ) but i 'm not going to take it lightly , make 11 changes or change the system			2
‘ it 's going to be tough , it 's different , but that 's the cup , it 's a good thing			1
it 's like individual finals			0
you need to win all the time to get through			0
it brings a good feeling to the team because it 's a small celebration if you get through			0
promising start : winger @entity132 impressed on the weekend and could continue in midweek ‘ i want to win , i do n't want any draws			0
i want to get back to winning ways so we have that feeling so on saturday we go into the game ( against @entity136 ) with a winning mentality			0
’ the commercial department at the @entity139 will be hoping @entity11 is good to his word .			2

@entity2 reached last season 's final where they lost to @entity3
@entity11 's side face @entity46 on wednesday night in @entity40
