by @entity0 to foreigners , it is endearing if not a little baffling – the ultra-polite @entity4 habit of apologising for things that are not necessarily our fault			0
now a study has found that saying a superfluous ‘ i ’m sorry ’ makes us appear more trustworthy			1
the stereotype of the continually apologetic @entity12 , as depicted by actor @entity13 , has become a romantic comedy staple , amusing our @entity16 friends who clearly see the trait as a weakness			2
unnecessary apologies feature heavily in the film @entity20 , starring @entity13 and @entity21 ( pictured ) , and now researchers have discovered that apologising for situations an individual is powerless to change , makes them appear more trustworthy to others their own experts now suggest this could be far from the case			1
researchers at @entity30 have discovered there are in fact ‘ significant ’ advantages to apologising for problems beyond our control – such as travel delays , a noisy restaurant or simply when someone else carelessly knocks into you			1
@entity41 , assistant professor of business administration and lead author of the study , said : ‘ superfluous apologies represent a powerful and easy - to - use tool for social influence			1
even in the absence of culpability , individuals can increase trust and liking by saying “ i ’m sorry ” – even if they are merely sorry about the rain			0
’ the study , co-authored with the @entity56 , used a number of experiments to gauge the usefulness of the gratuitous ‘ sorry ’			0
in one test , a male actor approached 65 strangers – 30 of them women – at a rain - swept train station and asked to borrow their mobile phone			2
in one of the experiments a male actor approached 65 strangers on a rainy day and asked to borrow their mobile phone			2
demonstrating the power of an apology , half of the strangers offered to lend him their phone if he apologised for the weather , compared with only nine per cent when he asked straight out half the time he simply made the request and the other half he prefaced it by saying : ‘ i ’m sorry about the rain ! ’ almost half the strangers lent him their phone when he apologised – but just 9 per cent agreed to do so when he did not			1
the same trend emerged during a laboratory experiment , in which 177 adults watched a video of a stranger approaching a delayed passenger at an airport and asked to borrow his or her phone			0
many more said they would lend the phone if the stranger apologised over the flight delay			2
in another experiment , 178 students were told they were playing a financial computer game with a partner sitting in another room			0
they were warned the computer would sometimes override their decisions			0
whenever this happened and their partner apologised for the computer , the student tended to rate him or her as more trustworthy , and became more generous towards them			0
another experiment found that people were more willing to lend their mobile phones to someone who apologised for a flight delay before asking to make a call than someone who simply asked for a favour			1

@entity16 researchers said apologising for situations an individual can not change , such as rain , makes them appear more trustworthy to others
researchers at @entity30 found superfluous apologies represent a powerful tool for social influence
in a *series* of experiments , people were more likely to lend a stranger a phone if they apologied for an *unrelated* event before asking for the favour
