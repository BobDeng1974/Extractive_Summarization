by @entity0 they have been married for 45 years but still @entity2 struggles to recognise his own wife in a crowded room			1
the 67 - year - old was born with the rare condition prosopagnosia or ' face - blindness ' , which means he is unable to recognise faces			1
the computer - programmer from @entity10 has spent his life developing various strategies to help him handle social situations			1
mr @entity2 , who can not pick out his own face in the mirror and likens his condition to dyslexia , said he has learned the clothes his wife wears and picks out his grandchildren , according to their ages			1
@entity22 @entity2 was born with a rare condition prosopagnosia or ' face - blindness ' , which means he can not recognise people 's faces , including his own in the mirror and that of his 66 - year - old wife @entity30 ( left ) ' i ca n’t recognise my own face in the mirror , i ca n’t recognise faces in pictures and i ca n’t recognise even my own wife ’s face , ' he said			1
' all i know is a face is a thing at the top of the body			2
' most people can see individual people in that thing called a face - but i simply can not			1
' if a normal person is shown two photographs and asked if they are the same individual , most people would instantly say yes or no. ' but i have to start scanning to match an ear with an ear or a nose with a nose and make a guess from each of these features			0
' most people can also spot someone when shown a front picture of the face and a profile – however when i ’m shown a picture from the front and profile i ca n’t match the features so i ’m totally lost			1
' the easiest way for me to explain the condition to people is to describe it as like having dyslexia for faces			1
' in a similar way to how a dyslexic - person has problems seeing words made up of letters i have problems seeing a face which is made - up of features			2
' mr @entity2 has spent his life developing various strategies to help him handle social situations , and can only spot his wife of 45 years by recognising her clothes and hairstyle face - blindness is often caused by a stroke or injury to the brain – however in rare cases such as mr @entity2 's it can be inherited			1
as well as failing to spot members of this family in the street , mr @entity2 also struggles to follow the plot of television shows , failing to spot characters			1
even famous faces in magazines and newspapers leave the 67 - year - old baffled			1
the condition is so rare that it was little - understood until recently			2
it is thought to be caused by a problem with the part of the brain called the fusiform gyrus , which is responsible for face recognition			0
despite his condition , mr @entity2 studied maths at @entity108 and went on to write software for computers			2
it was there he met the woman he would marry , fellow @entity108 student , @entity115			0
' when i first met @entity2 ’s family i was the one who had to explain to him who everyone was , ' the 66 - year - old said			1
' i had to introduce myself and then get their names from them so he knew who was who			0
' the funny thing was @entity2 ’s family was large with lots of uncles , cousins and in - laws so it was confusing for him			1
' i knew then that there was something very special about @entity2			2
' with the help of his wife , who acts as his minder at parties , community meetings and family gatherings – mr @entity2 has raised three sons and six grandchildren			1
' even after 45 - years of marriage @entity2 can only recognise me by my hair , my clothes and as he puts it – by the way i move , ' she said			1
' so for the past 40 - years i ’ve had to keep my old short - perm hair - do and same style clothes , which does feel like being in a bit of a fashion time - warp			2
' once , @entity2 was being presented with an award in @entity149 for his work , so i treated myself to a new hair - do			2
' of course when i arrived outside the venue , @entity2 walked straight past me like i was n’t here			2
' but he ’s always joking that he does n’t have strange women showing up at the door too often , so he ’s not likely to let anyone in he ’s not supposed to			0
' mr @entity2 said he is lucky his grandchildren - @entity157 , 17 , @entity158 , 16 , @entity159 , 13 , @entity160 , four , @entity161 three , and @entity162 , one - all are either different ages or have different colour hair , allowing him to guess who they are			1
the father - of - six has learned to spot his grandchildren , distinguishing them by age			2
the couple are pictured with their granddaughter @entity159 , 13 @entity172 is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people 's faces			1
also known as ' face - blindness ' , the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers			1
some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face , while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces , and in more severe cases sufferers can not distinguish a face as being different from an object			1
as in mr @entity2 's case , some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces			1
the condition is not related to memory loss , impaired vision or learning disabilities			0
it is thought to be the result of abnormalities , damage , or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory			0
@entity172 can result from stroke , traumatic brain injury , or some neurodegenerative diseases			0
in some cases the condition is congenital , and present at birth			0
it appears to run in families , which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion			0
some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and @entity226			0
treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies , including relying on voice recognition , clothing , or unique physical attributes			2
source : @entity235 however , when they are around other children it becomes confusing , he added			0
' there was a funny moment when my eldest grand - daughter @entity157 decided to play a prank on me , ' said mr @entity2			2
' she has red hair but there were other children with red hair also			0
her friends saw that i could n’t tell whether or not it was her			0
' then she turned round and grinned at me , and i knew it was her			0
this was her little joke to prove to her friends that i do have a condition			0
' at children ’s parties where lots of kids are around i tend to play with them all			0
i just have to do my best to keep track of my own grandchildren			0
' as well as haircuts , distinctive features , footwear , speech and movement , mr @entity2 uses other tricks to lead a normal life			2
' i use clothes and shoes to tell people apart , ' he said			2
' women can be easier than men , but they do have the annoying habit of wearing different clothes each day , which means i do lose track of them			0
' for most of his life , mr @entity2 did not realise face blindness existed , so it was impossible for him to explain why he could not recognise people he had already met			1
but since his diagnosis by the @entity284 , he finds by being up - front and open about his face - blindness that he can finally enjoy a relaxed social - life			1
' i am active in meetings with the council as well as in the community through amateur dramatics and in my local church , ' he said			0
' at meetings where i know people is fine , but i ’ll draw a diagram of where everyone is sitting			0
' now i tell people about my face - blindness up - front so they introduce themselves when they see me			1
' most people understand if it ’s explained to them properly			0
' and i have @entity115 with me usually			0
she does a wonderful job of saying people ’s names aloud while we are meeting them			0
' now i treat my face - blindness as a thing to laugh about not a something to get het up about			1
' this means no - one need gets embarrassed , especially not me			0
