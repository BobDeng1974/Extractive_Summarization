the @entity0 is one of the pre-eminent sport leagues in the world and every week , @entity4 will bring you a round - up of all the action on and off court stateside			2
news - maker @entity11 's @entity11 return to the @entity12 from the @entity13 was the big story of the summer but all has not gone to plan so far			1
only three players have more turnovers ( 46 ) than @entity11 this campaign and the @entity12 , who were expected to steamroll the weaker @entity19 , only ended a four - game losing streak when they overmatched the @entity21 106 - 74 on monday night			1
still , @entity11 was phenomenal in that game , finishing with 29 points , four rebounds , 11 assists and three steals in what was perhaps @entity12 's best performance of the season to date			1
so far the @entity12 ' have struggled due to lack of overall depth			1
the team 's ' @entity13 ' ( @entity11 , fellow new signing @entity32 , and @entity34 ) were expected to make the @entity12 immediate contenders , but , @entity32 and @entity34 have yet to match the defensive consistency of @entity11 's old @entity13 colleagues @entity38 and @entity39			1
this team 's potential might be greater than that of the @entity13 , who won two titles and reached two more @entity0 finals during @entity11 ' four - year spell in @entity47 , but they are still a long way away from looking like potential champions			1
@entity11 ( right ) celebrates with @entity50 during @entity52 's game on wednesday good week the @entity53 made it six wins on the spin on tuesday night as they enjoyed a 114 - 97 win over the @entity13			1
the star of the show was undoubtedly @entity60 who continues to illustrate why he is one of the best pure shooters to ever play the game			1
the league 's foremost marksmen poured in a season - high 40 points on 12 - of - 19 shooting ( including a silly 8 - of - 11 from three - point distance ) in the victory as the @entity53 moved to 11 - 2 under new coach @entity69			1
@entity60 ( centre ) has impressed this season , and continues to illustrate why he 's one of the best bad week last week we told you about how the @entity74 had lost their first 11 games of the season			1
fast forward a week and they still have n't won a match			2
they did lead at half - time of monday night 's game against the @entity82 but fell to a 114 - 104 loss in the end			1
the @entity74 are now 0 - 15 and in massive danger of setting a record for the worst start in @entity0 history			1
the 2009 - 10 @entity89 currently hold that questionable honour after beginning the season 0 - 18			2
' nobody is rolling over or pointing fingers , ' 76ers coach @entity91 said after the @entity95 loss			2
' this locker room is great			0
you go home and sleep ok			0
it was n't that bad			0
there were a lot of positives tonight			0
' @entity103 only knows how positive he will be if they actually win a game			1
@entity74 have lost their first 15 matches of the season , approaching the worst ever start nobody gets @entity108 on the cheap another struggling team are the @entity112 and @entity108 is taking a lot of the heat for signing a two - year , $ 48.5 million contract extension last season			1
the @entity0 has a strict salary cap and some have painted @entity108 as selfish and greedy for not taking less so the @entity112 could enjoy more financial flexibility moving forward			0
@entity108 is not in the mood for apologising to anybody though			0
when asked what he thought about @entity123 giving the @entity124 a ' hometown discount ' when it came to renewing his deal , @entity108 said : ' it 's the popular thing to do the player takes less , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah			0
i think it 's a big coup for the owners to put players in situations where public perception puts pressure on them to take less money			0
because if you do n't , then you get criticised for it			0
' for the record the @entity124 are 10 - 5 and the @entity112 are 3 - 11 @entity108 ( left ) has been branded selfish and greedy for not taking a smaller salary at @entity112 and finally ... his dad , @entity141 ( aka @entity141 ) , may have made it big in the music industry , but @entity144 has been making some noise on the basketball court			2
the high school senior produced a ' mixtape ' to try and attract the attention of college teams			0
on the video he shows a versatile skill set			0
he can handle the ball , knock it down from long range and set his teammates up for open looks			0
he has also been playing against , and matching , some of the best prospects in the country			0
alas his small stature , he is just 5 ' 9 ' , has stopped big colleges recruiting him , but he could be one growth spurt away from becoming relevant in the sport			0
