the @entity1 ’s voice of golf @entity2 has spoken of his ‘ great sadness ’ at the prospect of the corporation losing live coverage of @entity8 to @entity9			1
‘ i ’m just glad i am 83 not 35 and reliant on working for the @entity1 ’s sports department , because i think i would be looking for another trade , ’ he said			1
@entity2 believes the writing has been on the wall for years , but is disappointed his employers have n’t done more to keep the @entity15 happy			1
‘ in one sense it seems to me it ’s like playing poker against @entity20 or @entity21 in that the @entity1 ca n’t compete against @entity9 ’s bottomless pockets of money , ’ he said			1
‘ and you ca n’t deny @entity9 do a fantastic job			1
' you might be annoyed at the adverts but they go to faraway places and cover these events even though there might be only eight people watching on thursday			0
their commitment to show everything is extraordinary			0
legendary golf commentator @entity2 will be sad to see @entity8 leave terrestrial screens @entity36 kisses the @entity37 after his two - stroke victory at the @entity39 @entity41 's triumph was available for all to see on @entity1 , but that all may change with the rumoured new tv deal ‘ but , hand on heart , i ca n’t not criticise the @entity1			1
they are far and away the @entity15 ’s biggest television client , so why have n’t they said to them : “ you know , we ’re struggling against the financial might of @entity9 but why do n’t we also cover some of the other events you run , like the @entity50 and the @entity51 and the @entity52 ? ” we used to do those events years ago , so why not again ? i think it would have shown the @entity15 that they cared			1
i definitely think going back there were people who fought harder to keep tournaments on the @entity1			2
at one point we covered 18 events			0
‘ now you look at the move up to @entity65 and how many millions that cost , and you wonder about the value in that			0
this week we ’ve got two or three hours of indoor bowls on each day which of course is of great interest to the people who play it but no interest at all to anyone else			0
i guess for some people it ’s progress but for people like you and i , it seems a move in the opposite direction			0
’ the ‘ crown jewels ’ are a list of prestigious sporting events of national importance which may interest non-sports fans			0
the events are protected under the @entity88 , which ensures they are shown on free - to - air television — such as the @entity1			2
delayed highlights of the b - list events also have to be shown on terrestrial television			0
crown jewels : - @entity94 - @entity96 and @entity97 finals - @entity99 and @entity100 finals - @entity101 and the @entity102 - @entity104 tennis finals - @entity106 ’s @entity96 final - @entity109 ’s @entity108 final b - list : - @entity111 matches — exclusive @entity113 live coverage on @entity114 since 2006 - @entity104 non-finals play — live coverage on @entity1 - all other matches in @entity119 finals — all 2015 matches will be shown live on @entity121 or @entity122 - @entity8 — live on @entity1 until 2016 - the @entity123 — exclusive @entity113 live coverage on @entity114 since 1995 - @entity126 — shown on @entity114 since 1992 , every match live since 2003 - @entity127 — live on @entity1 - @entity128 — live coverage on @entity1 until at least 2017 - @entity130 matches involving home countries — live coverage on @entity1 until at least 2017 as you can probably gather , this is a subject on which the great man feels rightly passionate			1
how could it be any other way since he ’s worked for the @entity1 since 1961 ? ‘ it ’s been a large part of my life and i have enjoyed every minute of it and it seems to be really sad that it ’s all coming to an end largely because of money , ’ he said			2
‘ but this is the way of the world , i suppose			0
i never thought the masters would be taken away from the @entity1 , for example , or rather the rights split with @entity9			1
@entity151 do n’t have a money tree , rather a money orchard , but you get one or two new people on a committee who see this carrot dangled in front of them , and i guess that ’s the same with the @entity15			2
‘ but i ’m not sure the @entity15 balance the books in the best way			0
they ’re very generous to golf clubs who have parts of their course eroded by the sea and do great deeds around the world			0
but think about the audiences the @entity1 get for the masters over @entity9			1
it ’s always five times as much			0
should n’t the @entity15 take those figures into account , when participation levels in the game are falling ? ’ negotiations between the @entity15			0
the @entity1 and @entity9 over live rights for @entity8 from next year are expected to be concluded over the next fortnight			1
it is widely expected that coverage thereafter on the @entity1 will be restricted to highlights packages each evening			2
former open champion @entity184 , who worked alongside @entity2 at the @entity1 for many years , agrees it will be a ‘ sad day ’ if @entity8 is no longer aired live on free - to - air television			1
but , given the @entity1 ’s apparent state of apathy , he can fully understand why the @entity15 are likely to jump ship			2
at 13 years of age , sir @entity190 was inspired to play golf while watching the 1971 masters on television @entity195 is favourite to be appointed @entity197 ’s @entity123 captain in mid-february ‘ it was wonderful to work for the @entity1 when they were fully committed to golf but they appear ready to withdraw altogether now , and so who can blame the @entity15 if they give the rights to @entity9 ? ’ he said			1
‘ the world turns , and @entity9 have done such a wonderful job for the @entity204 and are so professional in their coverage			2
’ as for @entity2 , he has no plans for retirement			0
‘ although i ’m creaking and groaning a bit these days i ’m still lively from the chin upwards and still have opinions , ’ he said			0
‘ i still enjoy it , and i ’ll be at the masters , @entity8 and women ’s open			2
i just feel so sorry for all those who have enjoyed live golf on the @entity1 over many years and all those millions who ca n’t afford @entity9			1
let ’s hope a deal can be done that looks after these people			0
’ former @entity8 champion @entity184 ( right , with @entity2 ) also believes it will be a ' sad day ' if the @entity8 moves			1

@entity2 speaks of ' sadness ' at the prospect of @entity9 taking @entity8
@entity2 says the @entity1 ca n’t compete with @entity9 ’s superior spending power
the @entity8 could be shown on the *satellite* channel from 2016
*insiders* in @entity233 believe the deal will be *confirmed* soon
