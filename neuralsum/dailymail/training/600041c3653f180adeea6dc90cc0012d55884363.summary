by @entity0 published : 12:23 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 13:59 est , 8 november 2013 four students had to be rescued from the @entity2 of @entity4 's roof after a drunken prank went wrong			1
two fire crews and a police helicopter were called after the university students clambered on to the @entity2 ’s roof last friday night			1
the @entity2 ’s @entity10 is part of the cathedral - which dates back to the 11th century and has protected status as a world heritage site			2
it is thought the students were mimicking ' night climbers ' from @entity18 and @entity19 - who scale walls and buildings for a dare - but they got stuck and were unable to get down			1
' disrespect ' : four students scaled the @entity2 of @entity4 's home on friday night , which is attached to @entity26 , pictured , and had to be rescued by emergency services home : the students were rescued from the roof of the @entity2 's home , pictured , by a police helicopter the rescue estimated to have cost several thousand pounds			1
the helicopter was needed to locate the students on the cathedral buildings			2
today the @entity2 , the very rev @entity39 , criticised the students ' ' reckless ' behaviour			1
he said : ' i can not deny that i am deeply concerned that the cathedral has been treated with such disrespect , that @entity45 has been brought into disrepute and that the taxpayer has had to bear the costs of a wholly unnecessary emergency call - out			2
' reckless ' : the very reverend @entity39 , pictured , has condemed the students - thought to be mimicking the @entity52 ' night climbers ' ' but what most worries me is the reckless disregard the students had not only for their own lives but for others , in particular colleagues here at the cathedral and members of the emergency response team			1
' alcohol has obviously played a key part in this dangerous adventure and it is vital that this issue is addressed for the sake of good relations between @entity4 and the university , and the welfare of the students themselves			0
' ironically it was other @entity45 students who alerted cathedral security staff to the incident			0
thank you to them , cathedral staff and the emergency services			0
' @entity81 said the students have received a warning for their behaviour			0
a force spokeswoman said : ' i can confirm that police and fire brigade were called to a group of students who were on the roof of the @entity92 on friday evening			1
these students were helped down by police and fire brigade			0
' they attended @entity4 police station on november 6 to meet the neighbourhood police team and were given a warning regarding the consequences of their actions			0
' the university is investigating the incident			0
professor @entity103 , pro- vice-chancellor and deputy warden of @entity45 , said : ' we are taking this incident very seriously and are currently investigating it in accordance with our internal procedures which includes liaison with the emergency services			0

four students climbed on the @entity2 of @entity4 's roof - part of the *historic* @entity26 - late on friday night and became stuck
were rescued by fire crews and a police helicopter following drunken dare
rev @entity39 condemned the student 's ' reckless ' behaviour today
' the cathedral has been treated with disrespect , ' he said
