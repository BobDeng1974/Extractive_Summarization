@entity0 had become dependent on sugar two years ago , i was overweight , unhappy , stressed out and moody with spots and bad habits			1
and i was exhausted and often felt ill. the cause ? i 'd become dependent on sugar : hopelessly , chemically and emotionally dependent on it			1
so , i stopped eating sugar - rich foods			1
that included not only the obvious culprits , but all processed food , alcohol , anything made from refined wheat ( bread and pasta ) and potatoes			1
admittedly , the first week was tough			1
but once your larder is restocked with nuts , oatcakes and kale chips , you no longer miss that bar of chocolate you used to have every afternoon			1
but what if your neighbour buys you a box of chocolates and then sits down with you to share them over a cup of tea ? or what if you go to a friend 's house and she 's made pulled pork - a dish that 's marinated in sticky sugars - served in white bread buns with a sweet barbecue sauce and chips ? do you tell her you ca n't eat it , then munch through your emergency packet of oatcakes while everyone else is tucking in to dinner ? i 've learned how to deal with these situations - and here 's how you can , too			1
most of my friends know i no longer eat sugar and cater accordingly			1
however , if i 'm invited to dinner , i never remind them or ask what they 're going to cook			0
i do n't want to be neurotic and controlling , so i normally eat what i 'm given			0
it 's not the end of the world if it 's not low in sugar			1
and home - made food is usually fine			1
if i 'm asked beforehand if there 's anything i do n't eat , i say i do n't have a sweet tooth , so i 'm not keen on puddings			0
sometimes i take a selection of cheese with oatcakes , which the hostess can whip out at dessert time			0
this ensures i have something on my plate while all the other guests are oohing and aahing over their chocolate torte			1
i also bring fizzy water to drink instead of alcohol			1
fruit is incredibly high in sugar , so do n't overdose on it			1
most of your five a day should come from vegetables			0
fill your fruit bowl with avocados , lemons and limes			0
the occasional helping of antioxidant - rich dark berries ( blueberries and blackberries ) is ok , as these contain less sugar than other fruit			1
you could eat cheese with oatcakes after dinner , and most of your five a day should come from veg soon after i gave up sugar , i stopped at a service station to buy a snack , but there was nothing i could have ! there was n't even plain water - only @entity106 flavoured water , which has 27g of sugar in a 500ml bottle			1
that 's the equivalent of 7 tsp of sugar or three @entity111 doughnuts			2
the other day , i was catching a train from @entity113 in @entity114 and searched in vain for something i could eat in the station shops among all the doughnuts , sweets , sandwiches , cupcakes and sushi ( it 's sugar that makes the rice sticky )			2
i had to go outside the station to a nearby branch of @entity127 and grab a bag of their tasty ( and , at £ 1.50 , pricey ) kale chips			0
the worst places for a sugar - free snack are newsagents , with their rows of chocolates , sweets , crisps and fizzy drinks			1
airports are n't much better			0
obviously , alcohol is out , so i drink fizzy water on the plane or spicy tomato juice			2
if it 's a short - haul flight , i never eat the meal that 's served			2
usually it 's a processed , salty , squidgy mess that is n't really worth its calories			2
instead , i stop off at a @entity149 outlet and buy carrot and celery batons with hummus or bags of nuts and wasabi peas			0
if you 'd like to indulge , go for a glass of red wine and sip it slowly alcohol is full of sugar			1
if you must have a drink , try vodka - which is low in sugar - with soda and a squeeze of lime for flavour			1
but beware ! six weeks after giving up sugar , i felt light - headed after just two sips ! at a dinner party , if you 'd really like to indulge , go for a glass of red wine and sip it slowly			1
wine is lower in sugar than many types of beer , so it 's a better choice			2
if you live or work in a big city there 's a lot of choice for lunch			0
at the canteen salad bar , a sandwich chain , a little independent place or a health - food eatery , you 're bound to find a selection of low - sugar meals			1
but if you 're trying to follow a low - sugar plan in rural @entity191 or the @entity192 , you should probably put together a packed lunch			1
the easiest way to do this is to make a bit extra of what you ate the night before , then freeze it or put it in the fridge for lunch later in the week			2
otherwise , soups are great ( but check the label for sugar ) , as are salads			2
if you want sandwiches , avoid processed white or brown bread and opt for breads made from spelt , rye or amaranth			1
and good old oatcakes can be topped with smoked salmon , hummus , avocado or beetroot			0
you can also take a little pot of full - fat natural yogurt into work to round off your meal			2
the body often misinterprets dehydration as hunger in my drawer at work , i always have oatcakes , unsalted nuts and a jar of ground cinnamon to provide an instant flavour hit to coffee , porridge or yogurt			0
choose organic corn chips - think @entity235 , but without all the artificial flavourings			2
get plain if you can , lightly salted if you have to			0
only eat snacks when you 're hungry , not when you 're bored			0
it 's best to drink a glass of water first - the body often misinterprets dehydration as hunger - and then see if you still feel hungry			2
bear in mind a few key rules when eating out : shy away from sauces			2
the more gloopy the sauce , the more likely it is to be packed with sugar			2
hoisin or black bean are prime examples			0
if you 're super hungry , have a few nuts before you go out			0
puddings are a no - no. have cheese or do without			0
most are high in sugar			0
for an @entity263 takeaway , i order dry chicken tikka with raita ( cucumber or mint yogurt )			0
if your local does n't deliver brown rice , stick some on the stove when you order and it should be ready by the time the meal arrives			0
at a @entity276 takeaway , choose a veggie dish with as little sauce as possible			0
pizzas from big chains are often high in fat , wheat ( the body converts this to sugar faster than any other grain ) and salt , so should be avoided			1

to order a copy for £ 7.49 ( @entity293 free ) , tel : 0844 472 4157			0
steak houses , french restaurants and @entity296 there 's nearly always something you can eat - a grilled fillet steak with spinach or a salad , for example			0
order poached or grilled fish , but avoid creamy sauces			0
@entity310 stir - fries with little or no sauce are fine , but @entity316 , @entity276 , @entity314 and @entity315 food tends to be sweet			1
choose a dry rice dish or sauteed veggies			0
@entity319 cut the bun - and go easy on the ketchup and mayonnaise			0
@entity322 one of the worst options is sushi ( because of the sugary white rice ) , so go for sashimi - thin slices of fish - and ask for brown rice on the side			0
@entity330 pizza , pasta and white rice are high on the glycaemic index , which means they quickly turn to sugar inside the body			1
however , many @entity338 do grilled meat or fish and salads			0
otherwise , opt for pasta with a light vongole ( clams ) sauce and get back to your low - sugar regimen in the morning .			1

@entity289 stopped eating sugar - rich and processed food , and alcohol
also anything made from refined wheat ( bread and pasta ) and potatoes
says while first week was tough , she no longer misses that bar of chocolate
has learned how to deal with *difficult* situations - now you can , too
