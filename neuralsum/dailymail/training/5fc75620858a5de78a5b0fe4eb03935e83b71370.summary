but this time i could n’t bring him back			2
' if @entity14 had n’t been there i do n’t know what i would have done			2
i was panicking and i thought there was no chance			2
' i thought he was gone			2
it was the worst day of my life			2
i would never want anybody to have to go through that			2
' i need the world to know how thankful i am to her			2
i know paramedics were on the scene a short time after but it was her that saved him			2
