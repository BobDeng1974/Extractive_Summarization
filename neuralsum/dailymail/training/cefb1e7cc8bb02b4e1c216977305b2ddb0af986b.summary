after one false start , the final frontier has finally become open territory for the commercial world , after the @entity5 rocket successfully launched from @entity6 this morning			1
the private space cargo firm 's historic launch to the @entity9 blasted off at 8.44bst , carrying with it a capsule loaded with 1,000lbs of space station provisions			1
also on - board are the ashes of @entity16 legend @entity15 , fulfilling his final wish to spend eternity resting in space			2
@entity48 is investing in @entity5 , as well as four other companies , to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles last summer			0
the first attempt on saturday stalled , as the countdown reached all the way to practically zero before there was an automatic shutdown by on - board computers			2
so instead of blasting off from @entity6 on a delivery mission to the @entity9 , the rocket remained on its launch pad amid a cloud of engine exhaust			1
the engine ignition sequence had started up , but there was an automatic shutdown by on - board computers			2
the unfortunate delay caught even @entity48 's most seasoned launch commentator off guard			2
' ... 3 - 2 - 1 , zero , and liftoff , ' announced commentator @entity74 , his voice trailing as the rocket failed to budge			2
' we 've had a cutoff			0
' billionaire rocket designer @entity80 attributed the problem to slightly high combustion chamber pressure on engine no. 5			2
' will adjust limits for countdown in a few days , ' he wrote via @entity86			0
standing tall : @entity5 9 and @entity88 spacecraft , pictured a day before its first launch , are in the final stages of preparation for their historic flight along with @entity9 supplies , @entity5 has one additional payload - sending @entity15 from @entity16 ' @entity94 and 307 other people 's ashes into orbit			1
having failed to launch the @entity16 acting legend 's remains into orbit in august 2008 when @entity100 's @entity5 exploded after take - off , this is the second attempt to put a seven gram capsule of his ashes into space			0
but friends and relatives of @entity15 , who died in 2005 aged 85 , who gathered at @entity6 will have to wait until tuesday for the next attempt after @entity5 stalled on lift - off			0
paying a minimum of $ 2,995 to @entity112 , @entity15 and 307 other people 's capsules will be launched from the @entity5 rocket nine minutes into the flight			1
once there doohans capsule will begin a decaying orbit of the @entity120 that will last between 10 to 240 years , ' until it reenters the atmosphere , harmlessly vapourising like a shooting star			0
' only governments have completed such a feat to date , with the @entity5 voyage the first time such a voyage has been completed by a private firm			1
ferrying the @entity88 into space , the mission to the @entity9 will be to deliver 1,000 pounds of non-essential cargo after passing a series of test maneuvers over the course of three days			1
if successful in its first - of - a kind mission , the company behind the venture @entity5 would collect the remaining payments on the $ 396 million contract it has with @entity48 and then enter into a $ 1.6 billion agreement for 11 more flights to the @entity9 the first step in the commercialisation of space to non-governmental firms , @entity5 is hoping one day to deliver up to seven passengers to the @entity9 and other destinations in low - @entity120 orbit			1
the @entity5 rocket suffers from an ' instantaneous launch window ' which means that if they do n't take off at the exact scheduled moment they will have to wait till 3.44 a.m on tuesday for the pad and the @entity9 to line up again			1
this will be the @entity5 's third flight as @entity5 have already sent the projectile into space on two previous occasions			0
but this will be the first time it will dock with the @entity9 - signalling the first time a commercial enterprise has ever hooked up with the orbiting space station			1
however , this mission from a private contractor is not without risk and could very well end in failure , something which @entity5 have been upfront and honest about			0
' demonstration launches are conducted to determine potential issues so that they might be addressed and – by their very nature – carry a significant risk , ' said a statement by the private space firm according to the @entity175			1
' all spaceflight is incredibly complicated , and this flight introduces a series of new challenges – it is only the third flight of the @entity5 rocket , the second of the @entity88 , and the first for a number of all - new components necessary to berth with the @entity9			1
' if any aspect of the mission is not successful , @entity5 will learn from the experience and try again			0
' if all goes well though on the next launch , @entity5 will carry the @entity88 into space and match orbits with the @entity9 flashback : the launch of @entity194 from the @entity5 launch pad at @entity196 , @entity6 , @entity197 in 2010 the full flight - ready @entity5 ( left and right ) with @entity88 onboard stands on the launch pad at @entity196 , @entity6 , @entity197 there it will go through a series of tests and will pass around one and a half miles below the station to see if its controls are testing properly			1
if that checks out ok , the @entity9 will allow the @entity88 to within 10 feet and pull it in for docking all the while traveling at 17,500 mph			1
staying on board the space station for a week and a half , it will then be re-loaded and sent back to @entity120 where it will land in the @entity212 and be retrieved			1
the launch and subsequent mission will be nerve - wracking for @entity5 and @entity80 , the @entity216 entrepreneur who founded the space exploration firm			1
an artists view of the space station 's robotic arm reaching out to grab @entity5 's @entity88 which will happen if all goes according to plan after this saturday 's launch ' we have to allow for the fact that this is an extremely complex and tough flight			2
it 's a test flight , not a standard milk run , ' said @entity226 , a @entity227 aerospace consultant and former associate administrator in charge of science at @entity48 according to the @entity231			0
' @entity80 and @entity5 have a tremendous track record , and when @entity5 failed , they stuck with it and made it work			0
' they will have a failure again , because everyone does , but a test flight is a learning experience			0
@entity5 tested the @entity88 capsules ability to parachute safely ( left ) and to splash down in the @entity212 ( right ) ' regardless of how successful the flight is , whether it 's complete or partial , it 's a big step forward			0
this is a sea change			0
' originally , the plan was for @entity5 and their capsule to have docked with the @entity9 by 2009			2
' certainly , we would have hoped to have been further ahead , ' said @entity80 , founder of @entity5 to the @entity231			0
' but i would n’t have expected that with great confidence			0

launch was delayed last week after ' computer problems ' on board commercial rocket
trip is first time private firm have sent flight to @entity9
