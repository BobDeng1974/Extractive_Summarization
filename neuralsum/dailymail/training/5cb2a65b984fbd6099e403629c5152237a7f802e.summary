by @entity0 usually the worst kind of distraction on the putting green is a well - timed sneeze from your playing partner			2
but golfers at one golf club are having to contend with a very different kind of rat - like cunning			2
startled players at the @entity13 club near @entity14 in @entity15 have reported seeing a giant rodent lurking around the eighth hole			1
on the run : this capybara was spotted lurking around the eighth hole at @entity21 in @entity15 on further investigation the 4ft - long creature was identified as a capybara – the world ’s largest type of rodent which is usually found grazing the plains of @entity29			1
assistant club manager @entity30 said : ‘ a group reported seeing a giant rodent on the eighth and when we went to investigate we saw this huge creature the size of a small dog			1
‘ we did n’t know what it was until one of our members identified it			0
but we have no idea what it is doing on the course			0
’ at first it was thought the capybara had escaped from a zoo or private collection , or had been dumped by a bored pet owner			1
large size : usually found in @entity29 , capybaras can grow up to 2ft tall and weigh as much as 140lbs now @entity53 , manager at @entity54 in @entity55 , has confirmed it is missing a male capybara			1
he said : ‘ we keep on trying to catch it , but as soon as we try and catch it , it ’s moved on or it jumps in the river and shoots off			0
‘ next time we ’ve got to get a vet out and try and tranquillise it			0
‘ they run away from humans – they ’re quite shy			0
they ’re not like a rat , they ’re almost like a big hamster			0
’ distant relatives of guinea pigs , capybara are grazing animals native to countries such as @entity76 and @entity77 , where they are farmed for their meat and skins			2
