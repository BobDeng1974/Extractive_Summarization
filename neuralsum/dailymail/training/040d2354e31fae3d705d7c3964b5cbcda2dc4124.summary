the event involving the children - aged five and six - was organised by a father who serves in the @entity2 army			1
' one of the parents is a military man , he decided to show some guns and weapons to the children on @entity21 , ' said @entity45 , co-ordinator of patriotic movement ' resistance ' in @entity18			1

' these dummies were shown to the children , ' he said , denying web claims that the children had handled real weapons			1
' the parents were not against this idea			0
they posted the pictures online			2
' the event involving the children - aged five and six - was organised by a father who serves in the @entity2 army the children were shown and allowed to handle mock sniper rifles , kalashnikov machine guns , and grenade - shooting guns as well as hand grenades he stressed : ' i organise similar events in clubs for teenagers			1
when i was young we used sticks to play war games			2
' if only i had a chance to hold such a toy when i was in the nursery , i think i would have wet my trousers from happiness			2
' he claimed the children 's introduction to the weapons of war had nothing to do with the @entity10 crisis , in which the @entity89 accuses the @entity2 army of operating inside its neighbour 's borders			1
' it is just demonstration of the guns , ' he said			2
the organiser of this event was not a ' defender ' in @entity10			0
the children were shown and allowed to handle mock sniper rifles , kalashnikov machine guns , and grenade - shooting guns as well as hand grenades			1

' she was called to explain the event by the city 's educational authorities but no punishment is being brought against her			0
one furious blogger wrote : ' instead of saying ' thank you ' they carpeted her			0
who are they bringing up in these nurseries ? maybe gays and lesbians , like in the @entity89 ? ' ' this should be done regularly , ' said another , ' and we will return to the good old times when young men dreamed of serving in the army , and young girls despised those who did not serve			0
' another supporter said : ' do n't you see what kind of world we are living in now ? @entity2 must be strong and these kids must be ready for all challenges			1
' hostile comments included ' judging by this photo , they are bringing up killers ' , ' we are growing terrorists from nursery age ' and ' if you want to teach patriotism in the nursery , do it with singing or dancing ' .			0
