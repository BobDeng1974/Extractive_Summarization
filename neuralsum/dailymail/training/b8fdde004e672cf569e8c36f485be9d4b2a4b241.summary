the @entity0 was embroiled in a fresh row over press freedom last night after sneaking out proposals that would still allow police to sign off their own snooping into journalists ’ phone records			1
ministers had promised safeguards to prevent police misusing anti-terror powers to unmask potentially embarrassing confidential sources who blow the whistle to reporters			1
campaigners , including mps and barristers , wanted laws forcing the police to apply to judges before using the snooping legislation against journalists , rather than merely an officer of superintendent rank or above			2
revealed : @entity24 's newly - unveiled guidelines show police can continue to snoop on journalists but proposals unveiled by home secretary @entity24 made clear forces could continue to authorise their own applications for journalists ’ telecoms data under the @entity32 ( @entity32 )			1
the new acquisition and @entity34 also stated that the phone records of journalists , lawyers and even mps are not privileged			0
the @entity0 was also attacked for sneaking the guidelines out late on tuesday at the same time as a @entity41 report exposing torture by the @entity43			0
@entity45 mp @entity44 said : ‘ the new proposed codes of practice fall far short of what is required			1
without judicial oversight of the process , with a full judicial consideration for any request to handle any confidential or privileged information , we are likely to see more of the sort of abuses that have become so unfortunately commonplace			0
@entity45 mp @entity44 said the rules were ' improper ' ‘ this is an inappropriate and improper ruling ; it could , for example , put whistleblowers at risk			1
' as they stand , the proposed changes will bring little accountability or transparency to the use of communications data			0
the government should ban either interception or collection of metadata without explicit approval by a judge for journalists and lawyers			0
’ the 55 - page code of conduct was published follows a storm over two high - profile investigations in which detectives secretly accessed data to discover who had been passing information about senior politicians accused of wrongdoing			0
@entity85 detectives used the secretly obtained call records of @entity88 ’s political editor @entity87 to find and sack three officers found to have lawfully leaked information about the @entity92 incident			0
and @entity93 investigating the @entity95 speeding points scandal used @entity32 to secretly obtain the phone records of a journalist on @entity98 and one of his sources , even though a judge had ruled the source should remain confidential			1
police are normally required by the @entity104 to go to court to access a journalist ’s sources			1
but @entity32 powers require only that a request to access information such as who contacted whom , when , from where and for how long is approved by a police officer of superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants			2
under the new guidance , a senior police officer will still be allowed to sign off a snooping request , but must give ‘ special consideration to necessity and proportionality ’ if the application is made for the phone data of a medical doctor , lawyer , journalist , mp or religious minister			2
the code also requires police for the first time to make a note of the fact they have accessed a journalist ’s phone records			2
it appears to break promises made by the current chancellor of the exchequer @entity140 who said last month : ‘ inappropriate use of ( @entity32 ) ... is a tool used to fight against serious crime , and yet it has been used to investigate journalists and sources that journalists have			1
‘ that was not what @entity149 wanted that @entity32 for			0
if it ’s not something the prosecuting authorities and the criminal justice system can address , then it ’s something i think the government will have to address			0
’ launching a six - week consultation of the guidelines , immigration minister @entity157 said the government is ‘ clear that a free press is fundamental to a free society and we are determined to ensure that nothing is done which puts that at risk ’ .			2

ministers promised safeguards for secret sources and whistleblowers
but @entity24 's proposals make clear police snooping can continue
normally police are required to argue applications before a judge
but @entity32 lets them *bypass* *scrutiny*
