' the restaurant was later rated second in @entity29 for ' most disappointing cooking ' and fourth for ' most overpriced restaurant ' in the @entity33 's restaurant guide			1
the @entity47 star - known for his fiery temper - suggested the failure to retain its high ranking might be the result of a desire to offer more simple , cheaper , dishes to appeal to diners in the recession			1
but there was concern among diners that he might have failed to give the venture enough of his time - as he was appearing on tv shows and opening overseas restaurants at the same time			1
soon after @entity38 ( pictured with @entity2 ) quit as head chef , the restaurant lost its @entity37 rating 2008 : @entity2 's @entity37 - starred @entity67 at @entity29 ’s @entity68 closed after less than two years in business			1

his adviser @entity152 said : ' @entity21 and @entity140 have an incredible wealth of experience in catering and plan to roll out the concept			0
' @entity21 was dismissed in october 2010 after @entity47 star @entity2 accused him of hacking into private emails and plundering £ 1.4million from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising			1
@entity5 's general manager @entity127 said @entity2 's team had been dedicated to making the restaurant a success @entity2 had run the restaurant at @entity23 's since 2001 when he clinched the deal with his former business partner and estranged father - in - law , @entity21 ( both pictured ) @entity2 also claimed that @entity21 put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five - figure cheques to himself			1
@entity21 , who denied the claims , branded @entity2 a fame - obsessed ' monster ' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages			2

@entity2 ’s rise to fame led from restaurant kitchens to @entity89			0
he began with @entity223 , which won three coveted @entity37 stars in 2001			1
