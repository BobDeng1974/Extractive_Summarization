by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 5 august 2013 updated : 09:47 est , 6 august 2013 @entity1 has spent his whole life in hospital			1
the 45 - year - old @entity4 , whose mother died two days after giving birth to him , was struck down by infantile paralysis brought on by polio , leaving him incapable of fending for himself			1
he needs constant help with his breathing from an artificial respirator , can not walk unaided and has left his hospital ' universe ' barely more than 50 times			0
but despite his debilitating condition , @entity19 has trained as a computer animator and is making a film about his life , based on a story by his best friend , confidante and roommate , @entity29 , who also suffered polio as a child and has lived in the @entity19 's @entity32 ever since			1
survivor : @entity1 needs constant help with his breathing from an artificial respirator , can not walk unaided and has left his hospital ' universe ' barely more than 50 times ' some people think we are like husband and wife , but we are more like brother and sister , ' @entity37 told the @entity44			2
' every day , when i wake up i have the certainty that my strength is over there - @entity29			1
i trust her and she trusts me			0
' the pair were among 11 children admitted to the hospital with polio - an all - but - wiped - out but highly - infectious viral disease that affects under fives - in the 1970s			1
computer whiz : but despite his debilitating condition , @entity19 has trained as a computer animator and is making a film about his life best friend : the film is based on a story by his best friend , confidante and roommate , @entity29 , who also suffered polio as a child and has lived in the @entity19 's @entity32 ever since happy together : doctors never understood why @entity19 and @entity29 outlived the others , but they say the experience , while very sad , has brought them closer together forced to live in what was called a ' torpedo ' - effectively a body - encasing iron lung - during his early years , he was forced to create his own ' universe ' inside the confines of his hospital prison			1
his earliest memories are of ' exploring ' the corridors of each ward in his wheelchair , wandering into the rooms of other children , his only toy being his imagination			0
polio is a crippling and sometimes fatal virus that has been all but wiped out in the developed world			2
a highly - infectious disease , polio attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis , disability and even death			1
but thanks to a vaccine programme in the @entity103 , polio has been eradicated , though it remains a problem in @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			2
but 80 per cent of survivors later experience post-polio syndrome , though doctors do n't know why			0
the symptoms - pain and weakness , fatigue and muscle loss - can strike any time from 15 to 50 years after the initial disease			2
one of the major breakthroughs was the invention of the iron lung , a body - encasing machine that fills lungs with air by making the chest rise ( pictured )			2
before its invention , children with polio died frequently			2
but , with an average life expectancy of just ten years , @entity128 and @entity29 watched all their friends die , one by one			1
doctors never understood why @entity19 and @entity29 outlived the others , but they say the experience , while sad , has brought them closer together			1
' it was difficult , ' says @entity1			2
' each loss was like a dismembering , you know , physical … like a mutilation			0
now , there 's just two of us left - me and @entity29			1
' the risk of infection is high for @entity19 and @entity29 , so they rarely travel outside of the hospital			1
but advancing technology has allows them increasing freedom to see parts of the world that ordinary people may take for granted			0
they have , however , made the odd trip outside ; their most memorable outing was to the beach in the 1990s			0
' there are some [ trips ] which stand out , like seeing the beach for the first time when i was 32 , ' he says			0
' i opened the car door and saw the sea and thought ' wow ! what is this ? ' @entity29 , who says she had built an image of the sea based on films , pictures and postcards that she had seen , adds : ' they took us out of the vehicles , @entity19 was in a wheelchair and they pushed my bed onto the sand			1
' you enjoy these little moments , that many people take for granted			0
they do n't stop to marvel like we do			0
' because they have lived at the hospital for so long , they are allowed to decorate their room in whatever way they chose			0
while they say it often brings out a friendly argument , they have agreed to split the room down the middle			0
@entity19 's side is filled with film memorabilia , while @entity29 's side is full of books and dolls			1
neither have attended ' school ' in the way other children do			0
but that has n't stopped them gaining an education			0
the iron lung : forced to live in what was called a ' torpedo ' - effectively a body - encasing iron lung ( pictured left and right ) - during his early years , he created his own world inside the hospital with his friends			0
skilled pair : @entity29 is a published author and spends her time either writing or painting using her mouth inner strength : the risk of infection is high for @entity19 and @entity29 , so they rarely travel outside of the hospital indeed , @entity29 is a published author and spends her time either writing or painting using her mouth			1
@entity19 is using his computer animation skills , combined with @entity29 's storytelling , to make a @entity234 animated film called the adventures of @entity236 and her friends			1
and in may this year , he managed to raise the £ 45,000 he needed through an online campaign to realise his dream and begin making the stop - animation film			1
he says it follows @entity236 , which is also @entity29 's nickname , playing ' all the mischievous games kids get up to '			2
he says his characters are realistic because ' they come from someone who is disabled '			0
he added : ' i know [ exactly ] what the difficulties they face are			0

@entity1 has lives at @entity253 in @entity19 , @entity4
he has been there since he got infantile paralysis from polio as a baby
but he has trained as a computer animator and is making film about his life
it is based on story by his roommate and fellow polio - sufferer @entity29
he says : ' when i wake up i know that my strength is over there - @entity272 '
