by @entity0 published : 03:11 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 05:24 est , 27 august 2013 senior figures at @entity2 have warned that the prestigious institution could undermine its own reputation by relaxing admission standards for foreign students			1
students from the @entity8 and elsewhere are paying as much as £ 40,000 a year to study at @entity2 for up to a year			1
but they do not have to show the same level of academic ability as most undergraduates - and an internal report has voiced fears that the admissions are threatening the university			2
prestigious : but @entity2 is threatened by lower - quality students from overseas , according to a report concerns centre around ' associate students ' , who are typically undergraduates at @entity8 universities who spend between a term and a year studying at @entity2			1
they do not officially become members of the university , but are admitted to one of the 38 colleges , which have complete control over their own admission policies			2
an internal report revealed by the @entity31 warned that associate students ' pose severe reputational risk ' to the university , arguing that their standards are ' often low ' and claiming they are usually accepted on ' purely commercial ' grounds			1
most such students do not apply directly to the college , but are accepted via a commercial company which takes a cut of their fees			0
the largest such company is apparently the @entity43 , which charges $ 20,900 ( £ 13,400 ) per term			0
the firm places students with a number of colleges , including historic institutions such as @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 , which receive around £ 4,000 per student per term			2
danger : officials are concerned that @entity2 colleges are charging high fees to under - qualified students on its website , @entity43 says that its students can not get an @entity2 degree , but insists they enjoy the same level of teaching as normal undergraduates			1
it also states that ' admission is always entirely the responsibility of the @entity2 college ' - but according to the university 's internal report , they do not have to undergo rigorous checks of their academic qualifications			1
' although there is some assessment of their @entity77 [ @entity77 ] scores before they are admitted by each college , the transaction seems to be one of a purely commercial kind , ' the report said			0
the document expressed concern that employers and members of the public would not understand the difference between a full @entity2 degree and a year spent studying at the university			1
however , it admitted that the university had benefited from millions of pounds in fees paid by associate students for access to the @entity95			1
a spokesman for the university said : ' associate members ( formerly known as " associate students " ) pay a fee to use college facilities for a term			1
this is a way for colleges to make their facilities more widely available while earning income			0
' associate members are not @entity2 students and do not take up student places			1
they do not receive teaching and do not gain an @entity2 qualification			0
all this is made clear upfront			0
' alumni : @entity114 and @entity115 are among the many public figures to have studied at @entity2 @entity2 , whose alumni include hundreds of public figures such as @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity120 and @entity121 , has long had a tradition of attracting students from overseas			2
the elite @entity124 are considered one of the most prestigious academic awards in the world , with past scholars including @entity129 and @entity8 national security adviser @entity130			0
in addition , the university admits hundreds of fully - fledged foreign undergraduates , and insists that they are held to the same standards as @entity136 students			0
@entity136 universities have come under fire in recent weeks for allegedly treating overseas students as ' cash cows ' , charging them up to £ 35,000 a year compared to a maximum of £ 9,000 for @entity136 undergraduates			2
@entity2 and @entity143 are believed to have turned down more than 25,000 @entity136 applicants this year , nearly all of whom were predicted to get at least three a grades in their a-levels			0
@entity149 , from @entity150 , achieved seven a * s earlier this month , but was rejected by @entity2 and is now heading to @entity151 in @entity152			0
the pressure on places at good universities is so great that one straight - a student , @entity156 , is considering moving to @entity157 to study medicine after being turned down by everywhere she applied in the @entity136 .			0

@entity2 colleges are accepting ' associate students ' for up to £ 40,000 a year
