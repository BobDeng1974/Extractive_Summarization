it really does pay to go to church			0
after a @entity4 parish was bought out of a multi-income residential development it helped fund in the 1970s , it came into some money - to the tune of $ 1.6 million			1
and in deciding what to do with the unexpected fortune , pastor @entity11 , of @entity12 in @entity13 , decided to donate 10 percent of it to her own congregants			1
overjoyed : pastor @entity11 of @entity4 's @entity18 decided to divide up $ 160,000 her church received in a real estate among her 300 congregants donations : the church thus wrote out 300 personal checks for $ 500 each and gave them out at a service of september 7 generous : in the 1970s , @entity18 ( pictured ) helped fund a multi-income housing development , which was sold in june for $ 50 million			1
the church received a stake of $ 1.6 million in dividing up the $ 160,000 evenly , @entity11 worked out it was easiest to give each of her loyal regulars $ 500 , and set about writing personal checks			1
' in that moment , i was worried this is stupid , this is silly , ' @entity11 told @entity37			2
' people will think i 'm squandering $ 160,000			2
' and i did n't want to be known as the person who squandered $ 160,000 and so i was nervous about that			0
' but i felt like this was the place of faith			0
' ' it felt right			0
' so on september pastor @entity11 , as she is known , announced to the church that it was actually them who would receive a donation			1
' some started to cry , ' she said			0
' their mouths started to drop			0
i started to sweat because it sounded so crazy			0
' pastor @entity11 told her congregants to do whatever they believed was right in the money , be that investment , helping others or helping themselves			1
members started a board at the non-denomination church where they could right down some ideas on how best to use the $ 500			0
in shock : members of the church could not believe it when they were told they would be receiving the money ideas : a message board has been set up at the church where members can write days way in which they can use the money to help people there is still $ 1.4 million that the church itself will donate or invest			2
however pastor @entity11 said she really hopes her decision will inspire other churches			1
' my real hope is that other churches will hear about this and they 're going will swallow and they 're going to jump			0
' find some way in them that we found and that they 're going to jump with their people			0
' @entity12 owned a 15 percent stake in @entity93 , a 309 - unit residential development in nearby @entity95			1
according to @entity98 , @entity97 - based company @entity96 acquired the site in june as part of a $ 50 million buyout			2
the church came out with $ 1.6 million .			1

@entity18 in @entity13 bought out of residential development it helped fund in the 1970s
