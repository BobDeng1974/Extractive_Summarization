@entity3 's @entity2 - made @entity1 attack helicopters could be cut back or even scrapped outright because the @entity2 is set to upgrade it 's fleet			1
the @entity5 has used @entity1 gunships since 2001 , seeing action in @entity8 - where current pilots include prince @entity10 and in @entity11			0
despite the helicopters ' successes on the frontline , defence sources suggested that the @entity17 fleet of 66 @entity18 could eventually be cut to around 50 aircraft fit for operations			0
@entity3 's @entity1 helicopters face becoming redundant because the @entity2 has decided to stop using the model and adopt a newer variant , the @entity24			1
the @entity5 's fleet of @entity1 attack helicopters could be cut back or even scrapped outright , defence sources have admitted that means essential technical support for the @entity3 @entity1 fleet will be withdrawn from 2017			1
as a result , ministers must decide whether to upgrade some or all of the @entity3 helicopters to the new @entity2 standard , or to replace them outright			1
defence officials and @entity5 officers are finalising their assessment of the technical options in an exercise entitled the @entity40 , or ah @entity41			0
officials are due to present ministers with a list of detailed options in the @entity46 , with final decisions expected in 2014			0
colonel @entity48 , the commander of the army 's attack helicopter force , set out the options for the @entity40 in a recent public lecture			0

listing the options for the programme , he said : ' do nothing ; do the minimum ; technology insertion based on the current airframes ; update to the @entity2 ah - 64e standard , or this standard but with @entity3 - specific equipment ; or an entirely new replacement attack helicopter			1
' some analysts have suggested that the @entity3 could decide to replace its @entity2 - made @entity18 with the @entity87 - made @entity86 helicopter , which is currently used by the @entity89 and @entity90 armies			1
military sources told @entity92 that the @entity86 would be strongly opposed by @entity3 commanders , who regard it is inferior to the @entity1			1
that means the @entity96 is likely to focus on an @entity1 upgrade programme			2
however , modernising existing aircraft is often extremely costly , and insiders expect that the @entity96 will be unable to afford to upgrade all 66 @entity18			0
the @entity96 has refused to say how many of the @entity18 will be upgraded , leaving open the possibility that some of the fleet will be left unmodified and effectively redundant from 2017			2
the @entity96 told the newspaper : ' there are no plans to remove the @entity1 capability , on the contrary we plan to update and upgrade the fleet			2
the number required after 2017 will be taken according to operational requirements			0
' decisions regarding the future structure of the @entity1 fleet will not have an impact on the current operations of the @entity1 fleet			2

@entity3 's @entity1 helicopters face becoming redundant because the @entity2 has decided to stop using it
it means technical support for the @entity3 fleet will be withdrawn in 2017
