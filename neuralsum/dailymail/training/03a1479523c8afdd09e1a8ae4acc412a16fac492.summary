crime scene : @entity11 told investigators that he returned from a game of basketball on the night of september 28 , 2000 , and discovered his family slain in the garage of their @entity35 , @entity3 , home resting place : the grave site of @entity73 and her two young children , @entity15 and @entity16 both times , appellate courts ruled that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury , in the first trial by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs with @entity11 , and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter without any evidence to back up those statements			1
september 28 , 2000 , was like most days in the @entity11 household			0
after work , mrs @entity73 drove her children to sports clubs before setting off for home at about 7pm			1
mr @entity11 had left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church , where he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of friends			0

during his first trial , the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of september 28 testified in mr @entity11 's defense , telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders			2
