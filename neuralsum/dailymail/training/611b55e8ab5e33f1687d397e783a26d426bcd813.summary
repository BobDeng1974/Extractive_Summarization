a doctoral student has delivered a stranger 's baby after seeing her in distress at a busy campus bus stop - and later learned the new mother had named the newborn girl after her			1
@entity9 , 36 , was catching a bus home with her two - year - old son , @entity12 , from the @entity13 at @entity14 on wednesday when she noticed a woman gesturing to her			1
the woman led her to another , heavily - pregnant woman who spoke @entity19 and no @entity20 , but ms @entity9 soon learned that her waters had just broken - and that she was in obvious pain			1
ms @entity9 asked the woman how pregnant she was and , as she eventually understood the woman was 38 weeks along , a baby girl dropped into her loosened trousers			1
delivery ! @entity27 , pictured with her daughter and a paramedic , gave birth to the baby girl at a bus stop by the @entity13 - with the help of a stranger , @entity9 ' it was what every mother - to - be dreads , ' ms @entity9 told @entity40			1
' she was out running errands and her waters broke			0
but she stayed so calm , she was never in a lot of dire pain			0
' ms @entity9 placed her son on the bus stop 's bench and called 911 , and the dispatcher led her through the final processes , telling her how to use a shoelace to cut the umbilical cord			2
the dispatcher also told her to clean the baby 's nose and mouth and , without a sterile alternative , the team used the mother 's scarf			0
despite the bizarre situation near the busy campus , with students milling past , ms @entity9 said she stayed calm			2
official meeting : just hours after the new mother was whisked off by paramedics , @entity66 tracked @entity27 down in hospital and met the baby girl , named @entity9 , with her own child , @entity12 ' being a mum myself , i was able to put myself in her shoes and imagine how scared i would have been , ' she said			1
' if an undergraduate had seen her , i 'm not sure they would have been able to help			0
' new mother : @entity66 said @entity27 was extremely calm and quiet throughout the whole ordeal she added that her son witnessed some of the birth but did not seem bothered by it			1
he even asked whether the baby had grown into the woman 's trousers			0
moments after the delivery was complete , paramedics from @entity88 swooped on the scene and took the new mother and her daughter to hospital just a mile away			0
but as the events sunk in , ms @entity9 , from @entity97 , said she needed to know what had happened to the mother			2
' it was all i could think about , ' she told @entity40			0
' i just felt like our fates had crossed and we needed to meet again			0
' so on wednesday evening , ms @entity9 went to the hospital with @entity12 and her husband , @entity105 , to try to track down the woman and her newborn			2
a nurse put the pieces together and asked the new mother , who they learned was called @entity27 , for permission for the family to visit			2
' the nurse said her face lit up , ' ms @entity9 said , adding of @entity27 : ' she was calm and happy and beautiful , and the baby was at her side wrapped up			1
' the mothers officially met , and ms @entity9 was introduced to the eight - hour - old baby girl , who was a health 5lb 9oz			1
and when @entity27 asked @entity66 for her name , the new mother noted it down			1
@entity66 later learned that the new baby had been named @entity9 , because @entity27 thought she was ' an angel '			1
scene : @entity66 spotted @entity27 at a bus stop on the campus of @entity127 as she was heading home ' i am humbled , ' @entity66 said			1
' every single person who participated in my son 's birth is in my memory and always will be			0
to know that i am part of this woman 's birthing experience is just extraordinarily humbling			0
' after handing in her dissertation for her doctorate - on 18th and 19th century @entity139 - on monday , celebrating the presidential election on tuesday , and stepping in as a honorary midwife on wednesday , @entity66 said she wonders what else will happen this week			2
but there 's one thing she does know			0
' i really feel like we will meet again , ' she said of @entity27 .			0

@entity9 , 36 , was heading home when she saw @entity27 in distress
women do not speak the same *language* , but baby was delivered *safely*
@entity66 later tracked down @entity27 at a nearby hospital - and learned the healthy baby girl had been named @entity9
