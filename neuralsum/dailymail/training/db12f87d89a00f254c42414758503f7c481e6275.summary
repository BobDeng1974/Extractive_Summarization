by @entity0 and @entity1 follow @ @ martinkeown5 any changes from the @entity4 game ? @entity1 : i ’d be quite happy to go with the same team			1
yes there ’s debate over @entity9 but they are only starting positions on paper			1
it ’s good to have somebody starting wide who wants to play more centrally			2
you just should n’t restrict him			2
give him and @entity19 freedom to roam relative to each other			1
@entity0 : i ’m fed up with it and @entity9 must be fed up with it : there should be no debate over where he plays , he ’s got to play through the middle			1
@entity30 will have a second - string right back ( @entity31 replacing the suspended @entity32 ) so put @entity19 out wide , tell him to fill his boots and let @entity9 play in his best position			1
tricky : @entity19 should target the replacement right - back when @entity36 play @entity30 on thursday how will this game be won ? @entity1 : @entity9 holds the key , but i ’d like to see more inspiration from him			1
he makes good contributions but has become a bit conservative			0
i want him to unleash that brilliance because it ’s there bubbling under the surface			0
@entity0 : it ’s going to be very tight			0
@entity30 ca n’t play any worse but can @entity36 play any better than they did against @entity4 ? @entity30 are weak at the back and will sit deeper than @entity4 did			1
@entity36 will have to be patient because i do n’t think @entity30 will leave much space in behind			1
pivot : @entity9 holds they key for the crucial @entity53 game ... wherever he plays how do they stop @entity55 ? @entity0 : when a player is as unpredictable as he is , it ’s hard to know the answer ! if you stick tight , he turns you , if you stand off , he runs through you and if you double up , that leaves @entity62 spare			1
you ’ve just got to stay on your feet and not give him a chance to go over			0
do n’t be surprised if he ’s at the heart of some controversy			0
@entity1 : sitting on the bench against @entity71 , his knee still looked puffy so he ca n’t be 100 per cent fit			0
but you always have to expect the unexpected with him			0
he gets through seemingly impossible gaps so , as a defender , you have to concentrate			0
we ’ve listened all season to how good he is			0
now is their chance to stop him			0
master : @entity55 is difficult to stop ... but it is by no means impossible unfit : @entity55 is coming back from knee surgery ... as his scar here shows biggest lesson from @entity4 ? @entity1 : @entity36 played well but there is a lot to be learned from the @entity88 about how to take the sting out of games			1
they very professionally saw the game out and @entity36 need to show a similar calmness and not get anxious			1
@entity0 : i do n’t think there are any major lessons but you have to play players in their best positions			2
i think @entity99 and @entity100 could do a bit more to orchestrate the game in the middle and make us play			2
disappointing : @entity99 and @entity100 need to improve from their @entity4 performance advice for the players in a do - or - die game ? @entity0 : there ’s so much experience in that dressing room			1
i would n’t want to tell them to do this or that			0
but they have to be patient			0
@entity1 : the pressure is huge but the @entity36 players still need to enjoy themselves			1
you ca n’t play the occasion , you have to play the man in front of you			0
pass and move : @entity36 need to keep calm and play their natural game where will you watch ? @entity1 : by kick - off i think that i will have travelled about 10,000 miles around @entity127 ! but i ’ll be in @entity128 watching on			1
@entity0 : i ’ll be at home with my two boys cheering on @entity36 from the sofa			1
what does the word ‘ @entity30 ’ mean to you ? @entity0 : technically good but extremely volatile			2
they can get spiteful and it would be no surprise to see plenty of cards in the game			2
they won the first ever @entity53 and upset @entity127 in the final at the @entity144 in 1950			0
for such a small country , they have a rich football history			0
pedigree : @entity30 stunned @entity127 in the @entity144 in 1950 who is your all - time favourite @entity30 star ? @entity1 : i ’m not sure about a favourite but @entity155 certainly was n’t in my good books in 2004 when he won a penalty off me in the @entity158 ! @entity0 : i remember watching @entity159 at the @entity53 in 1986 and he was a brilliant playmaker			2
he became a bit of a midfield idol for me			0
foul ? @entity155 was n't in @entity1 's good books after the @entity158 in 2004 ... in one word , why should @entity36 be optimistic ? @entity0 : defence			1
it ’s a weak point that can be exploited			0
we are better than them			0
hope : @entity169 needs to believe @entity36 are better than @entity30 prediction ? @entity1 : it wo n’t be easy but @entity36 have the quality – 2 - 0			1
@entity0 : i ’m expecting a real battle and it will be very tight , but @entity36 to win 2 - 1 .			2

@entity9 could return to the centre against @entity30 , @entity19 out wide
the striker holds the key to *unlocking* the *opponent* 's defence
@entity36 need to avoid defeat in the @entity184 *clash*
three @entity186 should take lessons from @entity4 in how to close a game
