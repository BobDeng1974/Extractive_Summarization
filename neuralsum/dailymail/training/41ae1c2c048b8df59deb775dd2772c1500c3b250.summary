by @entity1 reporter published : 09:33 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 9 june 2013 television insiders are speculating that @entity5 's daytime talk show ' @entity3 ' wo n't make it to a third season and that the host could move to @entity9			1
' @entity3 ' launched in september 2012 and was syndicated to stations in more than 95 per cent of the country , but a recent @entity13 report showed that in @entity16 , the show 's ratings were down 30 per cent from the same period last year			1
as first reported by @entity18 , the show was renewed for a second season in january with executive producer @entity20 on board			1
veteran : before her own eponymous show , @entity5 was a co-host on the hugely popular @entity24 , and a respected news anchor for @entity26 @entity5 , a tv veteran of the ' @entity24 ' and a respected news anchor , launched the show with executive producer @entity30 , who quickly decamped for @entity9 to become the company 's worldwide president			1
since @entity30 's departure , reports of a lack of leadership and direction have surfaced , especially after his replacement , @entity39 , announced he too would be leaving the series after the first season wraps in july			1
a staff member told the @entity43 , ' @entity30 ’s departure left a void ... then they had four co-executive producers and the staffing decisions being made were poor			2
' another insider said , ' there was n’t a figure who could keep control			0
it became challenging because of the way that @entity30 left			2
there ’s been creative tension			0
' @entity39 will be replaced by a former ' the @entity59 ' producer , @entity20 as executive producer , but it 's unclear whether she 'll be able to undo the damage already done			1
abandoned ship : executive producer @entity30 left ' @entity3 ' soon after its launch to become the worldwide president of @entity9 meanwhile , buzz inside @entity68 has been that @entity5 could leave the show after the second season and head to @entity9 to join @entity30			1
' the show was oversold at syndication and has n’t lived up to expectations , ' one source told the @entity43			0
' now everyone at @entity68 is gossiping that @entity3 will end up at @entity9 with @entity30			1
' it 's not just insiders speculating about the show			1
critics , too , have perceived the lack of direction			0
' the program has had trouble finding a hook , ' wrote @entity86			0
' on ‘ @entity3 , ’ @entity5 has seemed at times like a peppy lifestyle reporter and at times like a de-fanged news anchor … ' other reviewers have labelled the show ' cheesily downmarket ' and ' lackluster ' , and many have noted @entity5 's apparent difficulty in choosing an angle ; she appears to teeter between hard news and daytime puff pieces			1
sources report @entity5 wants the show to be news - driven , but that her staff is ' stuck on more evergreen , formulaic daytime segments			1
' one insider was quoted on @entity102 saying , ' @entity3 has a controlling interest in her show and is not afraid to remind everyone			2
' ' @entity3 has stipulated that she will only interview @entity107 - type guests , and her blatant disregard for producers and executives alike has created such animosity that @entity68 [ execs ] have made it a top priority to find a replacement next season			2
' so far , @entity5 has garnered many big - name guests , though certainly not all @entity117 , including @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and the cast of @entity123			2
big guests : a recent episode of ' @entity3 ' featured @entity126 , who turned the tables on his interviewer , quizzing @entity5 about her outfit choice , her boyfriend and her previous tv shows despite this , the show , which screens weekdays at 3pm , has floundered			1
' it ’s an unmitigated disaster , ' @entity102 quoted one executive as saying			0
' one of the biggest failures ever in syndication			0
terrible ratings , no growth , should n’t be on the air			0
where did it miss the mark ? let ’s start with her , she is dreadfully boring			0
the show offers nothing new to the audience , nothing to say			0
' ratings winner : @entity5 found success as co-host of @entity154 's today show with @entity155 , from 1991 until 2006 there are even reports that @entity68 is seeking to replace @entity5 with a new daytime talent			1
' they [ @entity68 ] are desperately running around approaching talent and offering to train them to replace her as a new daytime talk show host , ' an insider told @entity102			0
' it ’s a number one priority			0
' but a source closely connected to @entity5 insisted that @entity5 is working closely with @entity68 and is still very much wanted by the network			0
anchor : @entity5 became a @entity170 anchor in 2006 and interviewed high - profile guests and world leaders including @entity173 , president @entity174 and @entity175 yet another insider is skeptical that @entity5 ’s show will complete its second season			2
' there is zero chance is goes to a third season , ' quoted @entity102			0
' it might not even finish the second			0
' a source close to the bubbly star told @entity18 admitted it was ' too early to tell ' if @entity3 would be back for a third season as ' there are so many different factors that make a third season discussion premature			2
' it 's all speculation until @entity5 's camp or @entity68 comment about the future of the show - both have remained tight - lipped on the subject .			1

@entity5 's daytime show ' @entity3 ' has suffered *fluctuating* ratings since its 2012 launch and is down 30 per cent in the latest poll
insiders are speculating the show wo n't make it past its second season
the is speculation @entity5 will *rejoin* former ' @entity3 ' executive producer @entity30 at @entity9
