@entity1 has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to @entity19 ' their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part - time and casual basis , increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit			1
' national secretary of the @entity6 , @entity5 , accused @entity1 of trying to reintroduce serfdom his comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the @entity19 , in which it recommended that the @entity32 be amended to ' enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week '			1
@entity1 's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees ' overwhelmingly supported ' and ' preferred ' the proposals			2
