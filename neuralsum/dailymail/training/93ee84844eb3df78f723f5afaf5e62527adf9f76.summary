the @entity1 staffer who called @entity2 and @entity3 has resigned today following a storm of outrage over her comments			1
@entity7 wrote a diatribe on @entity9 , slamming the @entity10 , aged 16 and 13 , for wearing casual clothing and looking sullen during the @entity13 turkey pardon			1
today , after thousands of calls for the self - professed media expert to be sacked , @entity7 has agreed to resign from her post as communications director for rep @entity18 of @entity19			1
' @entity39 and @entity2 , ' she wrote in the post , ' i get you 're both in those awful teen years , but you 're a part of the @entity43 , try showing a little class			1
' @entity7 added : ' act like being in the @entity13 matters to you			1
' dress like you deserve respect , not a spot at a bar			0
' and certainly do n't make faces during televised public events			0
' @entity39 , 13 , was dressed in a short maroon dress with a long cream cardigan that matched her thick cream socks , worn over bare legs			2
her sister @entity2 , 16 , wore black tights under a mini kilt with a grey and cream jumper			2
the @entity59 responded to @entity7 's comments on monday , with @entity13 spokesman @entity61 saying he was surprised a congressional staffer would use a @entity9 - themed event to criticize the first family			1
he says individuals who frequently speak publicly tend to be mindful of how their words are perceived			0
@entity61 added that it 's common sense that first daughters should be off - limits to criticism			1
@entity7 apologized for her post hours later , writing that ' judgmental feelings truly have no place in my heart ' , saying that ' hours of prayer ' had shown the error of her ways			2
apology : hours later she removed the original outburst , issued an apology and set her page to private the girls ' expressions during their father 's @entity9 address prompted playful comments on social media			1
after the president had pardoned the designated bird , a four - month - old 49 - pounder called cheese , he asked @entity2 if she wanted to pet the turkey			1
' nah ' , she replied , in a rare departure from her usual , gracious disposition , which prompted a flurry of remarks from viewers			0
but @entity7 's reaction sparked outrage			1
the incident was not @entity7 's first social media slip - up			1

and shagging # pandora , ' in reference to an @entity116 on @entity117			0
@entity7 later deleted the post and apologized for the ' accident ' - but insisted ' shagging ' is a dance term rather than a sexual reference			2
' it had nothing to do with @entity18			0
i do n't think he knows what @entity117 is ; he certainly does n't have it , ' she said , according to @entity128			0
following mass outrage to her post on thursday , @entity7 deleted it , set her profile to private , and issued an apology : ' i reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that i would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teenager			1
reaction : the girls prompted soft criticism for sullenly scowling at their father , the president , on @entity9 @entity107 users rushed to defend the girls who @entity7 said ' deserve a spot at a bar ' rather than the @entity13 ' after many hours of prayer , talking to my parents and re-reading my words online , i can see more clearly how hurtful my words were			1
' please know that these judgmental feelings truly have no pace in my heart			0
' furthermore , i 'd like to apologize to all of those who i have hurt and offended with my words , and pledge to learn and grow ( and i assure you i have ) from this experience			0
' over the weekend , @entity7 's critics defended @entity2 and @entity39 by tweeting the renowned picture of @entity158 's daughter @entity157 drunkenly tumbling over her friend on to the floor of a frat party , cigarette in hand , while her father was in office			1
the 2001 photo , which earned the then 19 - year - old the nickname @entity157 , went viral with the hash tag ' # classy '			2
other responses included a picture of the moment @entity157 , one of the former president 's twin daughters , stuck out her tongue at @entity13 photographers while riding in the presidential limousine			2
unimpressed : the @entity10 looked bored and unimpressed by their father 's jokes about turkey clothing : @entity39 wore a maroon dress and cardigan while @entity2 wore a mini kilt with black tights and boots ' awful teenage years ' : the cyber-bullying post addressed to the young girls said they are at an ' awful ' stage ' did you forget that jenna bush got photographed at the age of 19 knocking someone over at a @entity196 party ? good lord , ' one @entity107 user wrote			1
another commented : ' the @entity158 twins used fake id 's to get into bars			0
& @entity202 stuck out tongue at press			0
is that ' classy ? ' @ dcgopgirl # tcot # @entity206			0
' one wrote : ' where were your ignorant comments on the @entity211 family brawl , the @entity158 girls ( @entity213 )			0
' ' so @entity39 and @entity2 have no class ? two words : @entity202			2
# @entity217 , ' one tweet read			0
and one said : ' i have a feeling that @entity202 & sister are a little ticked off at # @entity217 for bringing their past behavior into the spotlight			0
