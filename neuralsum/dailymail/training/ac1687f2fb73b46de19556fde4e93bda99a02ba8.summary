by @entity0 and @entity1 sir @entity2 won gold at the @entity4 but his new business proposal is n't quite so popular olympic gold medallist sir @entity2 has sailed into stormy waters with his plans to build a futuristic sailing headquarters			1
the development would include offices , meeting rooms , training and medical facilities and a car park			1
as well as his @entity17 heroics , @entity15 helped the @entity19 win the @entity20 last year			0
he has submitted proposals for a high tower , which would loom over neighbouring buildings at the @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
but the proposal has upset residents of an upmarket waterfront area , with more than 200 attending a recent public meeting to discuss the proposal			1
and residents have banded together to fight the 25 - metre high tower at the @entity36 dock			1
@entity37 , chairman of a committee of opponents , said more than 200 people attended the public meeting at the @entity42 with many speaking out about the plans			1
mr @entity37 , who criticised @entity44 for rushing the planning permission process , said : ' i do nâ€™t like the way this has been railroaded through and taken as a fait accompli			0
' the public seem to have been kept out of it			0
' from the number of people at the meeting this clearly is a sensitive issue			0
' another objector , @entity56 , wrote : ' my principal objection is to the height of the building which will be 28 metres in contravention to the @entity61			2
' it is a monstrous carbuncle that needs drastic redesign to fit in with [ planning ] policies			1
' @entity65 is home to the far higher @entity67 , standing at a colossal 170 metres and one of the tallest buildings in @entity70 outside the capital			2
but resident @entity72 wrote : ' i remember when the @entity73 was first suggested there was a choice of design			0
where is the choice here ! ' he added : ' like a lot of people i want what 's best for the area that i have chosen to live in , and bringing work to the area is a good thing			0
modern : an artist 's impression of how the sailing centre would look - but it has upset many residents residents fear that if the building goes ahead it will tower over parts of old @entity65 looming : @entity65 also has the 170m @entity67 ( left ) , but an objector said that was better - planned ' however , building a huge structure that will dwarf everything around it is not the answer			1
' the planners must remember that first and formost , this is in a conservation area , and that brings many rules and regulations that we all have to abide by			0
' ' it is a monstrous carbuncle that needs drastic redesign ' - @entity65 resident @entity56 some , however , supported the plans			1
resident @entity112 said : ' as a @entity116 resident i fully support the proposed development			0
' the contemporary building design will create an iconic statement and be a huge improvement over the unattractive industrial units and parking area			2
' the development will be a great benefit to the @entity36 and a coup for the city of @entity65			2
' a @entity2 spokesman said : ' we understand everyone will have differing views on the design of the building , some people are very positive with the modern design			0
' within @entity65 there is a great mix of old and new architecture that sits together well and this is a further example of the same			2
' detailed : the plans have been lodged with @entity44 and will be decided in august @entity15 , pictured in 2011 , went on to become the most successful sailor in @entity17 history @entity15 won a silver medal on his @entity17 debut as a 19 - year - old at @entity145 in 1996 and went on to win medals at the following four games			1
