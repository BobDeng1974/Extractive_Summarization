@entity2 ’ shock demand for £ 1.7billion more from @entity3 has pushed us closer to leaving the @entity5 , a furious @entity0 admitted yesterday			1
the prime minister insisted the payment – which works out at £ 56 for every taxpayer – was ‘ not going to happen ’			1
and asked if the demand makes it more likely that the @entity3 will vote to leave in his promised 2017 referendum , he said it ‘ certainly does n’t help ’			1
@entity3 was told to pay more because its economy has performed better than expected			0
but countries including @entity23 whose economies have under - performed will receive multi-million - pound rebates – something critics said was essentially a reward for their ‘ basket case ’ economic policies			1
mr @entity0 made it clear he was ready to take legal action to try to block the @entity5 charge , which he compared with being ‘ clubbed with lead piping ’			1
he interrupted a summit of @entity37 leaders in @entity2 yesterday morning to demand discussion of the huge backdated charge , securing agreement on an urgent meeting of @entity5 finance ministers next month to review the proposed payments			1
controversial : the @entity3 was told to pay more as its economy has exceeded expectations but under - performing countries including @entity23 will receive multi-million - pound rebates ( @entity23 president @entity47 , right ) adamant : @entity48 , the outgoing president of the @entity16 , indicated that the £ 1.7billion bill was not up for negotiation but @entity52 ’s powerful leader @entity51 – whose country is set to receive a rebate – suggested @entity3 would eventually end up paying the vast sum , and said she had no problem with the calculations			1
and @entity48 , the outgoing president of the @entity16 , indicated that the £ 1.7billion bill was not up for negotiation			0
farcically , 24 hours after it emerged @entity3 was facing the budget surcharge , the @entity16 was still unable to explain how the figure had been calculated			0
the chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the @entity3 by the @entity5 in comparison with other member states there was a growing row last night over whether the @entity3 should have been better prepared for the charge			1
it emerged that chancellor @entity69 had known about the demand on tuesday but , embarrassingly , he had not passed on the information to the prime minister , who did not find out until thursday			0
@entity0 was left red - faced as he was forced to admit he had been kept in the dark for days about the shock £ 1.7billion demand after @entity69 failed to inform him			1
the surprise bill was presented to the @entity77 by the @entity16 last friday			0
but extraordinarily it was almost a week before the prime minister learnt about it on thursday			0
and according to @entity82 , the @entity81 might have known about it five months ago			0
mr @entity0 yesterday refused to apportion blame for the farcical series of events that led to him being told only hours before he arrived at an @entity5 leaders ’ summit in @entity2 on thursday			1
a three - page document informing the @entity3 of the £ 1.7billion surcharge to be paid by december 1 was sent to the @entity77 at the end of last week			1
it is understood senior officials were told of the massive demand on monday and the chancellor yesterday admitted he was told ‘ earlier this week ’			2
@entity96 chief secretary to the treasury @entity97 said : ‘ i personally first became aware of it over the last couple of days			0
’ but @entity82 suggested that the government should have known months ago that the budget recalculation was being done			0
@entity102 , the party ’s @entity37 spokesman , said : ‘ the @entity3 ’s @entity81 published a report over five months ago detailing the changes made to @entity3 growth figures which it clearly stated were for use in the calculation of a @entity110 ’s contribution to the @entity5 budget			1
‘ did the @entity100 delay making news public about this expected revision to the @entity3 ’s @entity5 contribution because of fears about how it would play out for the @entity118 ? ’ the @entity5 ’s financial demand is terrible timing for the @entity121 , coming weeks before the @entity122 and @entity123 by - election in which @entity125 is threatening to snatch the seat from them			1
at a campaign event in @entity130 last night , mr @entity0 suggested a lower sum could be acceptable , saying : ‘ if it is two billion euros , no we are not going to pay			0
’ earlier in @entity2 he had spoken of his ‘ downright anger ’ at the surcharge and said he would not pay on december 1			0
the £ 1.7billion bill represents almost a fifth of @entity3 ’s net contribution last year			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ it is an unacceptable way for this organisation to work – to suddenly present a bill like this for such a vast sum of money with so little time to pay it			0
‘ and it is an unacceptable way to treat one of the biggest contributors to the @entity5			2
‘ i am not paying that bill on december 1			0
if people think i am , they have got another think coming			0
’ mr @entity0 demanded an investigation into how the bill was calculated , adding : ‘ we will challenge this in every way possible			2
there may indeed be legal action			2
’ the prime ministers of @entity161 and @entity162 have also spoken out against the demands made to their own countries			2
asked whether the colossal bill made it harder to argue that @entity3 should stay in the @entity5 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ well it certainly does n’t help , let ’s put it like that			1
‘ i think there is a strong case for @entity3 involved in the @entity5 , if we can reform it in the way i have set out			1
‘ when you are presented with a bill like this , with a month to go , is that helpful for @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity5 ? no , it certainly is not			1
’ in @entity3 , the demand was criticised by even the most strident supporters of the @entity5 , with @entity182 @entity96 @entity181 joining @entity184 @entity118 backbenchers in condemning the @entity16			1
@entity187 , a @entity188 , said : ‘ just as @entity190 sentiment in @entity3 reaches a 23 - year high , the @entity16 clumsily gives @entity184 an open goal with budget request			2
’ chief secretary to the treasury @entity97 said : ‘ it ’s just not acceptable to try to change the fees for the @entity5 over many previous years , and then demand the money back at a moment ’s notice , without a proper explanation			1
’ @entity82 ’s @entity37 spokesman @entity102 said : ‘ it ’s unacceptable that the outgoing @entity16 should spring a backdated bill on member states in this way			2
’ eurosceptic @entity118 mp @entity203 said : ‘ the prime minister should tell them to stick their 2billion euro demand where the sun does n’t shine			2
we ’re already paying £ 20billion a year in @entity5 membership fees			2
they ’ve got a damn nerve coming back for more			0
’ the @entity23 media today reacted mockingly to mr @entity0 ’s refusal to pay @entity3 ’s @entity5 budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of @entity217			1
all major outlets highlighted the prime minister ’s fury , with the @entity221 running the headline : ‘ @entity223 refuses to take out his cheque book for @entity37 ’			0
@entity37 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the @entity217 theme , portraying mr @entity0 as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit @entity232 ’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring @entity234			0
@entity37 1 writes on its website : ‘ a diner unconvinced by the proposed @entity5 menu , @entity0 refuses to pay the bill			2
‘ it has to be said this is a bit rich , because @entity2 is demanding an additional two billion euros from @entity3 as part of its share of @entity5 budget			1
‘ faced with this request , the @entity3 prime minister has abandoned the traditional @entity246 reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on friday			0
’ @entity248 runs a picture showing mr @entity0 with his mouth wide open , and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the @entity3 @entity253			0
‘ under immense pressure from @entity184 , notably since the last @entity37 elections which saw @entity125 win more than 27 per cent of the vote , @entity0 believes that this demand does not support the issue of @entity3 being in the @entity5 , ’ the @entity254 daily wrote			1
like many other papers , @entity260 and @entity261 concentrate on the reaction of @entity47 to the growing crisis , quoting the clearly irritated @entity266 president as saying : ‘ respecting treaties is for everybody			0
’ @entity125 leader @entity269 said the only way to avoid the surcharge was by leaving the @entity5			0
‘ the @entity5 is like a thirsty vampire feasting on @entity3 taxpayers ’ blood			1
we need to protect the innocent victims , who are us , ’ he added .			0

shock @entity5 demand made on thursday works out at hefty £ 56 per taxpayer
@entity281 insists payment is ‘ not going to happen ’ and is ready to take legal action
@entity3 was given huge bill for exceeding expectations in economic *recovery*
