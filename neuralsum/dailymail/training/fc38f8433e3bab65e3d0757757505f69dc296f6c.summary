new face in the neighborhood : @entity2 bought a 66 - acre plot of land for $ 10.85million a retired nuclear physicist has filed a lawsuit because he feels that his new neighbor , @entity2 , is planning to cut off access to public hiking trails			1
@entity11 has filed a lawsuit against a host of individuals involved in the sale of 66 - acres of land next to his @entity16 , @entity17 summer home to the media mogul			1
@entity2 purchased the ski - in , ski - out property in march for $ 10.85million under one of her subsidiary companies , @entity24 , and now their last - minute dealings to make changes to the long - respected public trail agreements is under new scrutiny			2
' i do n't care if @entity2 is a neighbor , but if she is going to cut off access to trails , i do n't find that acceptable , ' mr @entity11 told the @entity34			2
@entity2 is expected to build a main mansion on the property as well as a guest house , but that is not the only construction that is due to start in the coming months			0
between 800 and 1,000 trees will be cut from the property , a new bridge will be built over a ski run to allow easier access and new roads will be paved			0
mr @entity11 's lawsuit does not take issue with any of the architect 's plans , but pertains specifically to the predicted prevention of access to the long - public hiking trails			1
the 86 - year - old physicist bought his home in the development in 1972 and he was one of the driving forces to create hiking trails in the property that sits next to the development			1
under dispute : dr @entity11 has filed a suit over the potential changes to the public rights access to hiking trails he helped establish in the area near his home incursion : one of the public trails that runs through the 66 acres @entity2 purchased is @entity69 ' @entity24 will continue to work with the residents of the @entity72 to enable them to have reasonable access over portions of the company 's recently acquired property for recreational trail use , ' @entity24 spokeswoman @entity70 told the @entity34 via email			1
taking issue : @entity11 , a retired nuclear physicist , has owned a summer home next to @entity2 's new lot since 1972 and helped found the trails in 1989 ' it is our hope that we can work together on a usage plan that is mutually agreeable			0
' the @entity34 reports that in 1989 , when the trails were created , the land belonged to the @entity90			0
the land was later given to @entity91 but only under the provision that the trails would remain open to the public and not hindered in any way			0
since then , the land was legally redistricted so that it became a part of the neighboring town , @entity97 , and parts - including the property that @entity2 went on to purchase - were sold to individuals who wished to build homes			1
@entity2 's specific land went to @entity103 and @entity104 who bought the land in the 1990s			2
throughout all of the turnovers , there was always specific language that preserves public access to the trails			0
that included a 2005 re-mapping of the area while still under the @entity114 's ownership , where the trails were incorporated into the map			0
mr @entity11 has included the @entity116 in his lawsuit because they allegedly asked to change the stipulations to that 2005 document , called a plat , before selling the land to @entity2 's company but without notifying any of the residents - including @entity11 - who would be effected			1
' one month before @entity2 closed on the property , the rights of way disappeared entirely , ' mr @entity11 's lawyer @entity124 told the @entity34			0
familiar : @entity2 first bought property in the area in 1994 when she purchased this cabin in with a view of the @entity132 out in nature : @entity16 , @entity17 draws visitors throughout the year with skiers in winter and hikers in the summer , and the public access to hiking trails is a major part of the tourism industry in the area local districting officials argued that when they were approached by the tv mogul 's legal team ahead of the march sale , they only clarified the language used in the 2005 ' replatting ' and did not inherently change the public access rights			1
' the town is supportive of continued access to @entity150			0
and we are working with ( @entity2 's ) team , and it is pretty clear they want to continue access , ' @entity97 director of community development @entity152 told the @entity34			0
mr @entity152 and the @entity97 mayor are also named in mr @entity11 's lawsuit , as well as the @entity160 and @entity2 's @entity161 one of the trails that mr @entity11 argues is under seige is @entity69 , which extends for 6.7 miles and is used by hikers , bikers , and joggers who do n't mind a bit of elevation with their daily run			2
lover of land : @entity2 bought this 41 - acre property in @entity173 , @entity174 for $ 50million in 2001 ( pictured ) different climates : @entity2 also owns an estate in @entity177 , @entity178			1

@entity2 's *llc* bought a 66 - acre property in @entity16 for $ 10.85m
public hiking trails have *crossed* the land for decades but now her neighbor is filing a lawsuit for fear that access is being cut off
the couple that sold the land to the media mogul went back to the town 's land *council* to get ' clarifications ' on the language about the trails
