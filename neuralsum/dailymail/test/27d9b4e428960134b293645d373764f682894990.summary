her top tips to achieving success include trusting your guts , be bold , and never back down			2
and @entity5 certainly lives her mantra			1
the award - winning tech entrepreneur 's ballsy attitude helped land her an investor in very unusual circumstances for her first business @entity12 - a leading technology services firm that handles payroll services , migration , salary packaging and contract - management and turned over $ 40 million in its first four years			1
' i was running a services company with an 80 million dollar turnover and realised i wanted more , ' says @entity5			1
' i was on a working trip to @entity25 where i was meant to be pitching on behalf of my employer to an investor but i thought , " i have 15 minutes , i better make the most of it "			0
' so i walked straight to his side of the desk and said " i 'm going to be here anyway one day so i may as well sit here now			0
" ' ' he laughed and said " who the hell are you ? ! " six weeks later i started @entity50 and he became my first investor and mentor			2
' 1.surround yourself with inspiration ' find people that are better at what you do than you			0
be around them and up your knowledge all the time			0
hire the right people ' from admin , to tactical , get those who are skilled in areas that you are n't as much			0
trust your gut instinct ' when i 've fallen in a big heap it 's been because i have n't followed my instinct			2
know your numbers ' when you 're looking for investors , know your financial literacy			0
they always look at numbers first , then passion and capability of the entrepreneur			0
@entity79 give up ' my mentor always says ' when you 're in the ring , fight until the end			0
' so even if you get hit get hit , get back up and be stronger for it			0
@entity5 , 43 , has now started eight companies , and last year caught the attention of @entity88 while staying on his private retreat @entity90			1
she was invited to visit @entity90 with a group other entrepreneurs			0
high on her bucket - list , she jumped at the chance and it was during alone time with the @entity98 mogul that her new project ' inspiring @entity100 ' came into being			1
' i was very conscious [ of the fact that ] he 's a busy man - you can imagine how many times he gets pitched to in a day , ' says @entity5			1
@entity5 told @entity88 and the staff at @entity107 about a new business concept she had that focused on the lack of awareness surrounding female entrepreneurs			1
' i had taken a film crew to my local high school , @entity117 high and talked to girls aged 8 - 17 about what an entrepreneur was and who came to mind , ' says @entity5			1
' they said @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , but they could n't think of one @entity31 and most did n't associate entrepreneurs with women			2
' the man , the myth , the legend : @entity5 received wise advice from @entity131 to : ' @entity132 and figure it out later ' empower entrepreneurs : @entity5 hopes new venture ' inspiring @entity100 ' will empower women in business ' i was so upset about the whole thing , it became the catalyst for my new business			1
i wanted to change the perception in @entity31 to be about recognising women as influential and doing incredible things , both socially and economically			2
' needless to say , @entity131 and his team were won over and it was n't long before she was flying to @entity147 to work with @entity107 on the idea further			2
but before @entity5 left , she was given some wise words of wisdom from @entity131			2
he taught me to " ' say yes and work the rest out later , " and to keep things simple			0
he can look at the most complex problem and have a simple , well thought out and articulate way of delivering it			0
' inspiration island : @entity90 is @entity88 's privately owned island in the @entity158 idyllic for ideas : on @entity90 , @entity5 says her business concept inspired women and helped launch her brand since @entity90 , @entity5 has gone on to launch her new business venture ' inspiring @entity100 ' a philanthropic endeavour she calls a ' business with a beating heart that 's social , sustainable and has a profitable smart heart ( neither non-profit nor capitalistic )			1
' the website inspiring @entity100 hosts a range of tools , support and network to help @entity31 female entrepreneurs reach their full potential			1
currently there is a mentor program whereby young entrepreneurs can be connected with senior mentors ( who are captain of industry executives or successful entrepreneurs )			1
the program is a collaboration with @entity107 , and soon there will be a ' @entity187 ' - an online portal where entrepreneurs can source investors			1
start - up success : @entity5 's experience has lead to her releasing book to inspire and share success stories to coincide with the website launch , @entity5 also published a book ' @entity100 : @entity31 's 50 influential women entrepreneurs ' which she plans to produce annually to spread the word about up and coming success stories			1
' my goal now is to aim for a million female entrepreneurs globally by 2020 , ' she says			0
