by @entity1 reporter published : 19:37 est , 25 february 2014 @entity3 : 09:50 est , 26 february 2014 @entity4 has doubled the number of small cars it is recalling and brought the total up to 1.6 million cars after announcing the new additions on tuesday			0
now up to six different models have been recalled because a faulty ignition switch used in the cars has been linked to multiple fatal crashes			1
just two weeks ago , @entity4 announced the recall of more than 780,000 @entity16 and @entity17			2
it has now added 842,000 @entity19 compacts , @entity20 and @entity21 and @entity23 sports cars			0
danger on the road : @entity19 compacts made between 2003 and 2007 ( this model is from 2004 ) have been added to the list of recalled @entity4 cars due to a faulty ignition switch that has been linked to 13 fatal crashes adding to the list : now 1.6 million cars have been recalled including @entity21 models from 2006 ( pictured left ) and 2007 , as well as @entity36 from the same period ( a 2006 model at right ) the company was immediately lambasted by a well - known safety advocate who says @entity4 knew of the problem for years and waited too long to recall the cars even though people were killed because of the problem			1
@entity4 says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power			1
that can knock out power - assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags			0
the problem has been linked to 31 crashes and 13 front - seat deaths			1
in the fatalities , the air bags did not inflate , but the engines did not shut off in all cases , @entity4 said			2
it was unclear whether the ignition switches caused the crashes , or whether people died because the air bags did n't inflate			2
glaring problem : in the report that they filed in issuing the recall , @entity4 noted that they first discovered a problem with the ignition switch in 2004 in cars like the @entity74 ( the 2005 model shown ) the vehicles being recalled include : @entity16 and @entity17 from the 2005 through 2007 model years ; @entity19 compacts from 2003 through 2007 ; and @entity20 and @entity21 and @entity23 sports cars from 2006 and 2007			1
most of the cars were sold in the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			0
according to a chronology of events that @entity4 filed monday with the @entity88 , the company knew of the problem as early as 2004 , and was told of at least one fatal crash in march of 2007			1
@entity4 issued service bulletins in 2005 and 2006 telling dealers how to fix the problem with a key insert , and advising them to tell customers not to dangle too many items from their key chains			2
that warning was not widely heeded , however , as the company 's records showed that only 474 vehicle owners got the key inserts			0
@entity4 thought the service bulletin was sufficient because the car 's steering and brakes were operable even after the engines lost power , according to the chronology			0
threatening : the company issued a notice about the problem but less than 500 drivers came in to have it checked , and 31 subsequent crashes occurred ( including in models of @entity23 like this 2007 one ) by the end of 2007 , @entity4 knew of 10 cases in which @entity16 were in front - end crashes where the air bags did n't inflate , the chronology said			1
in 2005 , @entity4 initially approved an engineer 's plan to redesign the ignition switch , but the change was ' later canceled , ' according to the chronology			1
' they knew by 2007 they had 10 incidents where the air bag did n't deploy in this type of crash , ' said @entity131 , executive director of the consumer advocacy group @entity132			0
' this is a case where both @entity4 and @entity88 should be held accountable for doing a recall no later than the spring of 2007			1
' @entity4 @entity136 president @entity135 said in a statement that the process to examine the problem ' was not as robust ' as it should have been and said the @entity4 of today would behave differently			0
addressing the issue : now , because the faulty switch is in so many cars , more than 1.6 cars are effected ( including 2005 models of the @entity145 ) ' we will take an unflinching look at what happened and apply lessons learned here to improve going forward , ' he said			1
@entity4 spokesman @entity152 said that initially the rate of problems per 1,000 vehicles was low , so the company did not recall the cars			0
@entity88 issued a statement that did n't address why the recall was n't done sooner			1
the statement said the agency is communicating with @entity4 about how long it took to identify the safety problem , but did n't specify if any action would be taken			0
dealers will replace the ignition switch for free , but @entity152 said it will take some time for the parts to be manufactured and sent to dealers			2
no time frame was given for making the repairs			0
' we are deeply sorry and we are working to address this issue as quickly as we can , ' @entity135 said .			0

six different @entity16 , @entity175 and @entity176 car models have been recalled
@entity178 cited a faulty ignition switch that could be *jiggered* out of place by a heavy key chain or bump in the road which went on to cause crashes
report issued to the @entity88 notes that they first learned of the problem in 2004 and the first death was in 2007
have come under fire for not issuing the recall much earlier
problem has been cited as a factor in 31 crashes which had 13 fatalities
