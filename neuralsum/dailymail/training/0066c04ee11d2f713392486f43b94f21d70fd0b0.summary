by @entity0 published : 15:01 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 27 september 2013 the @entity2 administration has found over $ 100 million in grant money to help bankrupt @entity4 hire more police and firefighters , and clear out blighted neighborhoods			1
but considering the @entity4 is at least $ 18 billion in debt , it will take a far larger infusion of cash or historic deals with bond holders , insurance companies and other creditors to correct the problem			1
four high - ranking @entity18 officials will discuss federal efforts and other opportunities today during a closed - door meeting at @entity22 with gov. @entity23 , state - appointed emergency manager @entity24 , mayor @entity25 and community and business leaders			1
a row of abandoned houses in @entity4 shows the destitute city amidst its financial woes , as the @entity33 government finds $ 100 million in grants to give to @entity4 the federal money being directed @entity4 's way by the @entity33 government will be augmented with about $ 200 million more in resources from foundations and @entity4 businesses , but it falls far short of the wider bailout some in the city had sought			1
' something is better than nothing , ' said @entity44 , 47 , a social worker who lives in @entity4			2
' a bailout would have been better , but if we can sustain some of our needs with grants that would be a start			2
whatever kind of money it is to benefit the city , i 'm all for it			2
' @entity57 , chief economic adviser to president @entity2 , said the administration scrounged through the federal budget and found untapped money that ' either had not flowed or had not gotten out or not directed to the top priorities for @entity4			2
' @entity57 and three other top @entity2 aides , @entity33 attorney general @entity64 , transportation secretary @entity65 and hud secretary @entity66 , will meet with state and local officials friday			2
@entity4 is still around $ 18 billion in debt , despite the government funding ( a @entity4 man runs along a street of abandoned houses ) the @entity2 administration repeatedly had signaled it would not offer a massive federal bailout like the one credited with helping rescue @entity76 and @entity78			1
' there is not going to be a bailout , ' @entity80 @entity33 sen. @entity79 told @entity0 on wednesday			0
' we have enough problems with the federal deficit			0
we need to be creative and look at existing programs			0
there are still some funds there			1
' the funding announced by @entity57 will include $ 65 million in @entity91 for blight eradication , $ 25 million in a public - private collaboration for commercial building demolition and nearly $ 11 million in funds to ensure working families can live in safe neighborhoods			1
@entity64 will announce $ 3 million that , in part , will be used to hire new police officers			1
about $ 25 million also will be expedited to @entity4 to hire about 140 firefighters and buy new gear			1
' it was n't enough to try and free the resources , ' @entity57 said			0
' we had to make sure they are well - used and targeted			1
' the @entity2 administration has found millions of dollars in grant money to help the bankrupt city ( president @entity2 pictured speaking in the @entity18 today ) in addition , @entity24 , the city 's emergency manager , has told the city 's two municipal retirement systems he wants to freeze @entity4 's pension plans and move to a 401 ( k ) - style system			1
the gathering today follows a series of meetings with the @entity18 to plot ways to pull @entity4 from a fiscal pit that this summer made it the largest @entity33 city to file for bankruptcy protection			0
@entity4 has had a poor record in making sure grant money is used properly and even spent at all			0
in 2011 , mayor @entity25 fired the director of the city 's @entity128 after an internal investigation revealed $ 200,000 intended for poor residents was spent on office furniture for staff members			1
the following year , his office had to scramble to use about $ 20 million in grants that had been left sitting for demolitions of thousands of vacant houses			1
the city 's @entity138 also allowed a $ 400,000 grant to lapse for a new armored vehicle			1
the grant troubles have rankled @entity24 , the emergency manager gov. @entity23 appointed to lead the city out of its financial mess			0
@entity24 has said @entity4 is so poor that it ca n't afford to lose out on any resources			0
in july , he made @entity4 the largest @entity33 city to file for bankruptcy protection			0
grants only can pay for things the city otherwise could n't afford			0
several businesses even pitched in $ 8 million earlier this year to help pay for a new fleet of emergency vehicles , including 23 @entity157 units and 100 police cars , to boost public safety and reduce response times			1
police chief @entity161 said thursday he was in @entity162 a few weeks ago in search of federal resources for his department			0
' our work together is critical in achieving our goals of making @entity4 a safe city and providing the necessary resources in raising the morale of our most valuable asset , our people , ' @entity161 said			2
the @entity2 administration is trying to show its support without trying to send any message about a bailout , said @entity178 , a @entity179 professor			0
officials , especially those from @entity182 and @entity183 , can commit funds for infrastructure projects , while @entity64 can chip in resources for fight @entity4 's high violent crime rate , @entity178 said			2
' so these are back door ways to provide federal funding and support without having to seek a bailout , which would be dead on arrival from both parties , ' he said			0
' the goal is to strengthen @entity4 , but only indirectly			0
this is at best a muted commitment because what @entity4 really needs is dollars and not just support that might be beneficial in three to five years			0
but any hope of that is a pipe dream			0

$ 65 million will go to @entity91 for blight eradication
$ 25 million for a public - private collaboration for commercial building demolition
$ 11 million in funds to ensure working families can live in safe neighborhoods
