much like @entity3 from the dr. @entity5 book , ' @entity2 , ' @entity1 kids were met with both delight and disgust when served typical breakfasts from around the world which to them seemed utterly foreign			2
' it tastes like cow poop ! ' said one young boy when tasting coffee from @entity15 as part of the gustatory experiment from website @entity19 video of the @entity1 youngsters trying foods from @entity23 , @entity15 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and the @entity27 has nearly half a million views on @entity29 since being posted yesterday			1
@entity23 : the @entity1 kids were less than thrilled when offered this @entity31 breakfast of anchovies , kimchee , and eggs though they dared to try it anyway gross ! : this @entity1 kid grimaced as he tried the breakfast typically served to kids in @entity23 the first breakfast the @entity1 children tried was from @entity23 and consisted of kimchee ( pickled cabbage ) , anchovies , egg , and other spicy foods , ' there 's a dead fish in it , ' said one of the boys as he proceeded trying the dish with caution			1
the others seemed to have a bit of trouble gulping down the savory tastes as well			0
when trying food from @entity15 they were given coffee , ham , bread , and banana			2
' i think it 's weird that kids in @entity15 drink coffee ' said one of the @entity1 participants who was as shocked as ' cow poop ' kid that the typically adult drink was an item on the menu			1
the children had no trouble munching on the banana part of the meal which may have been the most recognizable element on the breakfast table			0
you want me to drink what ? : this @entity1 likened coffee as part of this @entity15 breakfast to ' cow poop ' but did n't mind the bread , ham , and banana it was also served with next the adventurers were asked to try food from @entity24 which was characterized by a bowl of raspberries along with salmon and onion on a piece of bread			1
' no i would not eat fish for breakfast , ' said one girl who was presented with the common dish of @entity24			2
' this is pretty soft that could be my pillow , ' said the spunky young boy of the bread , salmon , and onion creation			1
one of the @entity1 kids was fond of the meal but was n't quite sure where it came from			0
' i actually would eat this for breakfast , ' he said			0
when asked where he thought the food might come from he replied , ' @entity113			0
' i 'd eat it : this kid said he liked the salmon , onion , bread and raspberry breakfast from @entity24 but guessed that the meal actually came from @entity113 another @entity1 girl who tried the fish breakfast had trouble placing a geographic origin			1
' what 's @entity24 , ' she asked ? ' a country in @entity127 , ' replied one of the adults serving her the food			0
the young @entity1 were then served a very old egg called a @entity132 in a breakfast menu from @entity25			1
' so it kind of has liked a portable toilet smell and a rotten egg smell , ' said one boy when describing the @entity139 food			0
@entity25 : one @entity1 youngster said that the extremely old @entity141 from @entity25 smelled like portable toilet and also rotten egg not pleased : this @entity1 child had trouble sniffing and stomaching this breakfast from @entity25 ' this is really good , ' said another			2
the egg , sausage , potato , and apple , breakfast from @entity26 proved to be a hit with the @entity1 kids			1
' this tastes like @entity157 fries and @entity157 fries are good , ' said one kid			0
the other kids stuffed their faces until they could n't take eating any more food			0
@entity26 : this @entity1 's eyes were bigger than his stomach when he was served the @entity26 breakfast of eggs , sausage , apple , and potato the final breakfast from the @entity27 which was @entity173 ( chocolate sprinkles ) on toast , proved to be the biggest hit			1
' i do n't think my friends would eat this for breakfast because their mom 's would say it would be too unhealthy , ' said one child			0
' this is great , ' said another girl as she voraciously scarfed down the toast leaving chocolate smudges all over her face			0
while some of the foods may have differed from the egg and cereal breakfast common to @entity1 children , chocolate sprinkle toast may be popular with kids in @entity1 and many countries across the globe			1
disbelief : this @entity1 said he did n't think he or his friends would be allowed to eat the chocolate dish at home for fear that it would be ' too unhealthy ' @entity27 : : the kids unanimously enjoyed the @entity202 ( chocolate sprinkles ) toast from the @entity27 and were sent into a chocolate stupor			2
