by @entity0 , deputy political editor @entity1 was accused of caving in to a ‘ stitch - up ’ by the @entity4 union yesterday as its candidates dominated the party ’s list of prospective @entity8			1
candidates who are backed by @entity4 , have worked for @entity4 or are members of @entity4 secured the top slot in ten of the 11 regional lists of @entity14 candidates for the @entity16 elections next may			1
that means that the vast majority of the party ’s representatives in @entity21 will owe their success to the union , run by hard - left firebrand @entity24			2
pressure : labour leader @entity1 faces claims of a union ' stitch - up ' after the party 's list of candidates for next year 's @entity16 elections was dominated by union - backed wannabe @entity8 @entity14 ’s deputy leader @entity35 boasted that the slate of almost 70 candidates ‘ come from all walks of life and from all different communities across the @entity39 ’			1
but two - thirds – 46 – have union links and 25 of those have ties to @entity4			1
in every case where existing @entity8 were standing down or @entity14 has no @entity46 – the most contentious selections – a @entity4 candidate came top			2
they include @entity49 , a political officer for @entity4 , who was involved in the @entity51 strikes and had a desk in @entity53 under @entity54			2
links : @entity56 - darling a former @entity4 official , and @entity14 mp for @entity59 , who said he had always been a @entity4 member others are former unite @entity16 officer @entity61 , and @entity4 member and former @entity14 mp @entity63			1
meps are elected on a list system , with the number elected from each party ’s list dependent on the proportion of votes they receive in each region			0
that means that only the candidates near the top of the list are likely to get elected			0
on its website the union claims that after the 2009 poll ‘ @entity4 now has eight meps in @entity21 out of a total of 13 @entity39 @entity81 ’			1
number one : unite national officer @entity49 , who had a desk in @entity54 's @entity85 , topped the list in the @entity87 the selections mean that if @entity14 were to do as well next year as they did in 2009 , the number of @entity8 linked to @entity4 would increase to 11 out of 13			2
and if @entity14 gains seats , as it might , in the @entity87 and the @entity91 , @entity4 candidates would be the beneficiaries			1
the announcement fuelled controversy in the @entity14 that unions have forced out strong local candidates			0
under @entity14 rules the candidates are initially selected by a regional panel on which the unions and local party bosses hold half the seats each			0
only then do party members get a chance to vote on where they would like them on the list			0
in the @entity87 one candidate who failed to get on the shortlist has accused @entity4 of imposing an all - women shortlist to ensure the success of @entity49			1
she is ranked number one on the list ahead of former mep @entity116 , who is also a @entity4 member			2
in @entity119 – where @entity4 - backed mep @entity117 is ranked number one – @entity121 , who topped the poll among @entity119 members in 2009 , was not even allowed to stand by @entity14 apparatchiks			1
her treatment prompted @entity126 , @entity14 ’s former general secretary , to complain : ‘ the feeling is that as she has a pro-business background she was blocked by the trade unions			0
it really is a stitch - up			0
‘ the regional panels are supposed to be balanced between local parties and trade unions but in reality many of the local party reps are really trade union placemen and women			0
' so many of the panels are pretty much controlled by the trade unions			0
powerbase : how @entity4 boasts about have ' @entity4 's @entity8 ' including several standing for election in 2014 ‘ the trade unions have then used their power to select who they want and block those that they do not			1
’ @entity148 has warned that trade unions wield an ‘ absolutely disgraceful ’ influence over the selection of candidates			0
a leaked @entity4 document earlier this year boasted that the union was ‘ working hard to ensure that good progressive candidates are high on the list			1
’ @entity157 : unite general secretary @entity24 has pushed for more union influence over candidates @entity61 tops the list in the @entity161 , while the top two selections in the @entity91 are both @entity4 members , former mep @entity164 and mr @entity63			1
he is a close friend of @entity165 , the former @entity14 campaign co-ordinator who resigned amid claims that @entity4 sought to stitch up a parliamentary selection in @entity168 for his office manager @entity169 , a close friend of mr @entity24			1
mr @entity63 says on his website : ‘ i was always a @entity4 mp , just as i have always been a @entity4 member			1
’ only in the @entity172 where @entity46 , a former @entity173 official , is top did @entity4 fail to secure the top spot – and in that case @entity4 member @entity175 was second			2
@entity178 party chairman @entity177 said : ‘ while @entity1 hides away in his @entity180 bunker , @entity4 continues its audacious takeover : they are buying @entity14 policies , pushing @entity1 around , and today ’s revelations show the top candidate in more than 90 per cent of @entity14 ’s @entity187 candidate lists is in @entity24 ’s pocket			2
‘ these candidates are former @entity54 aides and strike - organisers			0
even senior labour sources are calling it a “ union stitch - up ”			0
‘ it ’s the same old @entity14 , and if @entity1 can not stand up to @entity24 , he ’s too weak to stand up for hardworking people			0
’ a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ @entity14 ’s @entity16 candidates were selected in a ballot of individual party members – they , and they alone , made the choice			0
