by @entity0 last updated at 4:07 pm on 19th october 2011 an air traffic controller who fell asleep while working alone on an ' insane ' night shift knew he was struggling to stay awake shortly before dropping off , according to a report			1
the unnamed tower controller admitted he was ' dragging ... slipping , struggling ' as he became increasingly tired while three planes approached @entity9 in @entity10 in march			1
as a result , according to a @entity13 report published today , two planes landed in error after a regional controller mistakenly gave the pilots the impression they could land using rules for airports with manned towers			1
official report : an air traffic controller at @entity9 in @entity10 who fell asleep while working alone on an ' insane ' night shift knew he was struggling to stay awake shortly before dropping off both planes , which were carrying a total of 165 passengers , landed safely			1
the controller , began working for the @entity30 in 1990 before becoming a supervisor in 2005 , was temporarily suspended			1
he had been the only person working in the @entity9 tower at the time			1
the report said : ' when his awareness returned , he thought he had only been out for a couple of minutes			1
' he heard one pilot calling in a " forceful voice " , and shortly afterwards the pilot of the other flight was asking for the tower 's phone number			2
that was when he realised he had missed quite a bit			2
' the supervisor said that he knew he was n't coherent , and now believes that he had been asleep			0
' at the time of the near - miss , air traffic controllers at @entity9 were required to work a week of shifts starting at midnight each month , a schedule the controller described as ' insane '			1
the report details how the controller recalled waking up as if coming ' out of the haze ' and found it difficult to talk for three or four minutes			1
air traffic controllers are barred from sleeping while on shifts , even on breaks , although some workers admit to covering for friends the following day , concerned that he may have suffered a stroke , he visited his doctor			0
although the doctor failed to diagnose a stroke , he said it was likely the controller 's shift pattern was to blame for his falling asleep			1
the report also revealed that the controller had recently returned to the @entity72 after travelling abroad and was suffering from jet - lag			1
since the march incident , and a handful of other near - misses involving tired controllers , the @entity30 has made it law for a minimum of two controllers to be working n a tower at any one time			1
a recording of the radio chatter of one of pilots that had to land ' blind ' was revealed in april			0
the pilot of an @entity91 jet is heard as he is told the ground control tower is unmanned - probably because the controller ' got locked out '			1
the one - minute conversation between an @entity91 jet and a regional @entity30 facility 40 miles away in @entity97 , shows the horrifying line - by - line reality of the dangerous situation			0
the regional controller in @entity97 starts by outlining the problem to the pilot of the incoming @entity91 jet			2
' @entity30 administrator @entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 , president of the @entity106 ( right ) , visited air traffic control facilities following numerous incidents of controllers falling asleep earlier this year he said : ' the tower is apparently not manned , we 've made a few phone calls			0
' i 'm going to take a guess and say that the controller got locked out , i 've heard of this happening before			2
' the @entity91 pilot then responds : ' first time i 've heard of it			0
' @entity97 tower : ' yeah fortunately its not very often , it happened about a year ago			0
' aa pilot : ' interesting			0
' @entity97 tower : ' it is			0
' @entity122 : ' @entity72 1012 , tower is back in business			0
' aa pilot : ' that was a close call			0
' the incident raised serious questions about controller fatigue , a long - standing safety concern			2
@entity130 , a former @entity13 board member , said at the time : ' you have to watch your schedules to make sure ( controllers ) have adequate rest			0
' it 's worse when nothing is going on			0
when it 's busy , you have to stay engaged			2
' when it 's quiet , all they have to be is a little bit tired and they 'll fall asleep .			0
