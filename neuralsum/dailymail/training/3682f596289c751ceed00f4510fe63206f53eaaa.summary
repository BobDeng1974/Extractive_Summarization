' @entity33 take on @entity34 's on monday evening with the game being shown live on @entity36 at 5pm			0
@entity4 's debut @entity7 strike back in 2001 was a beauty			2
@entity41 crossed from the right , @entity40 nodded the ball back and the @entity1 star controlled it with his chest before firing into the bottom left corner from 25 yards			0
in an unforgettable night it put @entity7 2 - 1 ahead , just before half - time , before they went on to thrash the @entity49 5 - 1			2
@entity11 added : ' if the ball drops for me on monday like it did for him against @entity8 , i ’m smashing it			1
if i get the goal i ’ll obviously be happy but the win is all that matters			0
' youth : the @entity3 youngster made his debut at the age of 16 in an @entity59 match against @entity60 @entity3 manager @entity61 claims @entity11 , who impressed during the @entity3 ' emphatic 4 - 0 win over @entity23 in the @entity63 , is one of the most talented teenagers the country has ever produced			1

if @entity11 's own description of himself is anything to go by , the @entity70 is in for a treat when he finally makes it there			0
he joked : ' [ @entity78 midfielder ] @entity79 and i were talking about who i play like and he was trying to tell me i ’m like @entity82 but i ’m not having that i ’d prefer to think i ’m a cross between @entity4 and @entity83			0
