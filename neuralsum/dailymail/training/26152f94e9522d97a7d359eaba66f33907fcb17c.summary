by @entity0 and @entity1 pressure is growing on ministers to release secret flight records linked to the rendition of terror suspects – as they have now dried out			1
the @entity7 attracted claims of a cover - up last week when it told an mp who asked for the details of flights to and from the @entity15 island of @entity16 , that they had been ‘ water damaged ’			1
@entity19 , a foreign office minister added to the farce yesterday when he said the records , held by officials on the tiny territory in the @entity24 have now been salvaged			2
@entity25 ( left ) was the @entity26 foreign secretary who admitted that rendition to @entity16 had been used twice ; @entity29 mp @entity28 ( right ) asked about the status of the logs of flights which have passed through @entity16 between january 2002 and january 2009 in a rambling answer , mr @entity19 said officials had recently noticed the damage to the logs , which he said was caused by a roof leak during heavy weather			1
the documents are now , he said , in the process of being taken to a new location			0
the government only admitted in 2008 that the island , which has a vast @entity45 military base , was linked to the rendition programme - after years of denying any involvement			1
@entity25 , then foreign secretary , admitted it had been used twice for re-fuelling of rendition flights in 2002 , during the months after the 9/11 terror attacks			2
rendition is the practice of taking terror suspects to be interrogated in other countries with less stringent human rights regulations			0
it was said to have been used to allow the torture of suspects			0
ministers insist the suspects never left the plane during refuelling			0
but reports in the @entity45 claim the island hosted a secret prison and that it hosted more rendition flights in the following years			1
documents uncovered after the overthrow of @entity70 in @entity71 in 2011 suggest the @entity45 sought to use @entity16 as a stopover during the 2004 rendition of @entity74 , a leading @entity70 opponent , and his pregnant wife			1
the pair are taking legal action against @entity79 , which is also being investigated by @entity80			0
@entity81 , the director of the legal charity reprieve and lawyer for @entity74 , said there was no evidence of heavy rain in the area in june of this year when they claim the damage occurred			2
‘ it ’s unclear what exactly the @entity7 means by heavy weather ’ , she said			1
‘ perhaps there is a micro-climate over the hut on @entity16 where all the embarrassing files are kept ? ‘ in any event , it ’s hardly an answer to say they ’ve got out a hair dryer and patched the roof ; the @entity7 needs to hand the documents over to @entity104 , before some other invisible monsoon strikes			2
‘ and they need to take steps to retrieve the lost information from 2004 , the year my clients @entity74 and his wife were scheduled to be rendered via the island			2
’ @entity29 mp @entity112 , who has fought for years to get hold of the secret flight records , was told the 2002 records were ‘ incomplete due to water damage ’ in a parliamentary answer last week			0
yesterday @entity29 mp @entity28 , asked again about the status of the logs of flights which have passed through @entity16 between january 2002 and january 2009			0
the @entity121 at @entity16 , @entity122 mr @entity19 said : ‘ during routine work to add existing records to the store in @entity16 , @entity122 ( @entity122 ) immigration officials noted water damage to a small number of records , caused by a leaking roof			1
this is believed to have resulted from extremely heavy weather in june 2014			1
@entity16 may have been used as a stopover during the 2004 rendition of @entity74 , a leading @entity70 opponent , and his pregnant wife ‘ although the extent of the damage was not clear on initial inspection at the time … records from 2002 appeared to be incomplete due to water damage			1
however , since my answer of 8 july , @entity122 immigration officials have conducted a fuller inspection , and previously wet paper records have been dried out			0
‘ they report that no flight records have been lost as a result of the water damage			0
a small number of immigration arrival cards from 2004 have been damaged , but that information about those flights is still available in the daily occurrence logs and monthly statistics			0
these records provide dates of aircraft movements in the territory , and passenger and crew numbers			0
‘ following the incident , all hard copy records from the affected location are being transferred from the airport to a new location , and will be digitalised over the coming months			0
’ the @entity45 has a vast military base on the island			1
it was revealed in 2008 they had secretlyused the island as part of its rendition programme without informing @entity15 ministers			2
last month mps on the @entity175 said the @entity45 must provide binding commitments over use of @entity16 if it is to be allowed to carry on using it , as public confidence had been damaged by the disclosure .			1

damage caused by a leaky roof during heavy weather related to @entity16 in the @entity24
the government only admitted in 2008 that island , which has vast @entity45 military base , was linked to rendition
@entity16 was used for rendition of @entity70 opponent and pregnant wife
