the real - life @entity1 bear who suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws , teeth and fur is closer to finding a new home , thanks to the generosity of @entity13 readers			1
after the plight of @entity16 was highlighted by this newspaper last week , readers donated an extraordinary £ 30,000 to @entity18 , which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in @entity22 earlier this month			1
the elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus , where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box , and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself			1
the two drivers and the truck , equipped with a new cage , hay and blankets , will alone cost £ 2,700 , and the bear will also need help from veterinary staff and a support team , who will fly to @entity48 in advance			0
when the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow @entity16 to leave the country , they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in @entity69 to the @entity70 in @entity71 in the @entity72 , where she can live out her days in peace			1
because she is a spectacled bear , the same endangered species as @entity35 in the children ’s books by @entity78 , there are stringent conditions to be met before the authorities permit her to cross state boundaries			0
the organisation , which campaigns against the exploitation of wild animals , will have to delay @entity16 ’s flight by several weeks to ensure she is allowed aboard , at a further cost of thousands of pounds a day , so it is still appealing for funds			2
its president , @entity89 , said : ‘ we have been overwhelmed by the response from @entity13 on sunday readers to help @entity16			0
we now need one last push so that she can begin her journey to freedom			0
please give generously and help us save @entity16 and give her the life she deserves			0
