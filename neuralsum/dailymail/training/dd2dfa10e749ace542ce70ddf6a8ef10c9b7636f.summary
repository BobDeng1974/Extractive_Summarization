by @entity0 published : 05:03 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 07:46 est , 16 august 2012 a school report - style assessment of the health of the world 's oceans has concluded that they ' could do better '			1
the report , based on 10 factors such as clean water , biodiversity , food provision , tourism and coastal protection , gave the oceans a global mark of 60 out of 100			1
individual scores differed greatly between coastal countries , with highly developed regions , pristine tropical islands and uninhabited regions doing best			2
researchers have given the world 's ocean their first ' report card ' by studying cleanliness , biodiversity and other factors			1
here , a diver in the @entity29 , part of the @entity31 , dives with a turtle			0
the @entity33 received an average rating of 62 , while the @entity35 scored 63 and @entity36 70			1
@entity37 in @entity38 had the poorest result , 36 , while uninhabited @entity40 in the @entity41 was awarded the highest rating of 86			0
ecologist dr @entity43 , from @entity44 in the @entity35 , one of 30 international scientists who compiled the @entity47 report , said : ' when we conclude that the health of the oceans is 60 on a scale of 100 , that does n't mean we 're failing			1
' instead , it shows there 's room for improvement , suggests where strategic actions can make the biggest difference , and gives us a benchmark against which to evaluate progress over time			0
' the index allows us to track what 's happening to the whole of ocean health instead of just the parts			0
' the results , published in the journal nature , reflect the gulf between rich and poor parts of the world			0
researchers hope the new index will help them track @entity31 health , and safeguard wildlife such this whale			2
many countries in @entity38 , the @entity77 , and @entity78 achieved low scores while higher ratings went to parts of @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			2
human activities such as overfishing , coastal development and pollution have taken their toll on the oceans , said the researchers			2
lead author dr @entity93 , a @entity35 ecologist from the @entity94 at @entity95 , said : ' is the score far from perfect with ample room for improvement , or more than half way to perfect with plenty of reason to applaud success ? i think it 's both			1
' the 10 goals looked at by the experts were coastal livelihood and economies , sense of place , food provision , natural products , coastal protection , clean waters , artisanal ( traditional ) fishing opportunity , carbon storage , tourism and recreation , and biodiversity			1
different countries performed better or worse in different areas			0
the @entity33 did well in the natural products , artisanal fishing , clean water and biodiversity categories but had lower scores for coastal protection and tourism and recreation			1
among the main findings : developed countries generally scored higher than developing countries due to better economies and regulation			0
only 55 of countries scored higher than 70 , and 32 had ratings below 50			0
biodiversity scores were surprisingly high , partly because few known marine species face outright extinction			1
global food provision was far below its potential and could be improved if wild - caught fisheries were more sustainably harvested			0
restoration of mangroves , salt marshes , coral reefs and seagrass beds could significantly improve ocean health .			0

school report style study looked at clean water , biodiversity and tourism
@entity33 received a 62 , while the @entity35 *pipped* it with a score of 63
researchers called for action to improve scores
