@entity0 answered your questions in our live q&a earlier today			1
the @entity6 's new chief sports writer - who makes his debut in this weekend 's newspaper - will also be writing for @entity9			1
scroll down to read the answers to the questions you asked , from the events he is looking forward to covering this year to his opinion on @entity16 and @entity17			1
host commentator thanks for all your questions			1
you can read @entity0 's debut column in this week 's @entity6 and right here on @entity9			1
i admire him greatly as a manager			1
i ’m not sure what i think of him as a man because i ’m not sure he ever shows his true face			1
he ’s an accomplished actor as well as an accomplished manager			1
i find it hard to see how you ca n’t admire him as a manager , though			1
he is one of the most successful bosses there has ever been			1
he has won the @entity38 with two teams who were underdogs without the financial might of their opponents and he provokes great loyalty among his players			1
it ’s hard not to admire that			1
until recently , i would have said @entity48 fairly confidently but i ’ve begun to change my mind			1
i like @entity48 ’s unassuming style more and he is a wonderful , beguiling player to watch			1
but @entity51 is such an amazing all - round player , powerful in the air , lightning quick , great with the dead - ball , a fantastic dribbler			1
it is hard to separate them because they are so different but if i had to say now who was more valuable to a team , i ’d say @entity51			1
@entity51 , the @entity60 one			1
i sometimes feel that we have forgotten too quickly how mesmerizingly brilliant he was			1
he had that combination of speed , trickery and close control that often made him unplayable			1
it was always a thrill to watch him play			1
when @entity17 signed for @entity68 , i thought @entity69 had got a bargain for £ 16m , something i 've been reminded of every now and again on @entity72 as he 's struggled to get anywhere near justifying that fee			1
i always like to think of the @entity17 who played so brilliantly for @entity75 at @entity76			1
that showed what he 's capable of			1
it showed the extent of his talent			1
but he has been unable to get close to replicating that kind of form ever since and manager after manager has written him off as more trouble than he is worth			1
i hope that the winner against @entity91 can rescue his career at @entity93 because i do n't think there 's anything malicious about him			1
he just seems like an immature kid who has n't quite grown up yet			1
he has the talent to be a hit at @entity68 but he needs to buy into @entity69 ' work ethic to have a real chance of making the move a success and so far there has been scant evidence he is prepared to do that			1
instinctively , i want @entity108 , in particular , to be available to the biggest possible audience but the viewing figures on the @entity111 were n’t great and no one can deny that @entity112 do a fantastic job with their coverage of golf			1
i would like the @entity111 to devote more time and money to sport in general because i think they usually do a fine job but i suppose that , like many of us , they are in thrall to the fact that everything comes a distant second to football in this country and they have spent most of their budget on retaining the rights to @entity133 highlights			1
i was way too shy and self - conscious ever to consider becoming an actor			2
i used to go in to the @entity135 with my mum ( who has played @entity137 since 1961 ) now and again when i was a kid but it seemed to involve a lot of waiting around for her to do her scenes			2
there was one time where i was desperate for her to get away early so we could go and buy tickets for a @entity148 cup match before the ticket office at @entity150 closed			2
i moaned and moaned about it for so long that even my mum ’s patience snapped in the end			2
the @entity155 and the @entity156			2
but sometimes the best things are events that are off the radar , jobs that you do on your own in strange places away from the glare			1
sometimes , they can demand more of you and bring you more satisfaction			2
i went to watch @entity166 playing baseball once in @entity168 , @entity169 and managed to snatch a very quick conversation with him			2
those kinds of pieces are often the most enjoyable and satisfying to write			1
boxing , tennis and cricket			2
i am pleased that boxing ’s back on mainstream tv			2
i used to love watching it on @entity181 in the 1970s and it ’s great that the @entity184 fight is on			2
i do n’t think i ’ll be at the fight this time but i would love to get over to @entity185 for a future bout			2
first of all , if you love it , you ’ll be good at it			2
because if you love it , you ’ll want to work hard			2
and you ’ll need to work hard to be successful			2
so work hard and be persistent			2
do n’t take no for an answer and try to get on with people			2
people do n’t want to talk to people they do n’t like			2
he did n’t like me very much but the only time i ever interviewed sir @entity200 one - on - on , back when @entity197 trained at @entity198 , he was fascinating to listen to			2
the boxer @entity201 is probably the most articulate sportsman i ’ve ever interviewed			0
and he can talk and talk and talk			0
as for disappointments , i loved @entity203 as a player but the only time i ever interviewed him , he was sullen and almost monosyllabic			0
i did n’t particularly hold that against him , though			0
it was towards the end of a day when he had done about 50 interviews and i think by the time i got to him , he was making it plain he just wanted to be somewhere else			0
actually , no. we tend to have most of our major rows on screen , which is probably one of the things that makes the programme good			1
i have been party to – and maybe even involved in – some spectacular rows on various trips to cover sporting events			0
i remember one , in particular , at a restaurant in @entity224 where two journalists i have always admired tremendously , @entity226 and @entity227 , were engaged in a verbal battle that left me in awe of their conviction			0
i joined the @entity232 as their @entity233 in 1993 after working at the @entity234 and @entity235 for three years			0
the first job i did was to attend the launch of the new @entity239 car at @entity240 ’s in @entity241			0
@entity242 was driving for them then and i wrote a piece about him			0
i felt a bit out of my depth at the time			0
some might say i still am			0
as an addendum , the first trip i did for the @entity232 was to cover the @entity249 at @entity250			0
from there , i went to @entity252 to see @entity254 racing indycars on the @entity255 and from there i went to @entity60 to see the second gp of the season			0
until then , my idea of a work trip had been going through the @entity261 tunnel to cover a game at @entity263			0
i felt like i had hit the jackpot			0
i ’m a @entity266 fan			0
my dad ’s from the @entity269 area of @entity266 and he used to take me to @entity270 as a kid ( we lived a few miles away from the ground )			0
in those days , @entity274 played their home games on a friday night so i would go and watch either @entity148 or @entity197 at home on saturday afternoon			0
there was a spell when i went home and away with @entity197 and i went to plenty of @entity148 away games , too			0
one of the @entity197 fanzines called me a purple once because i ’m a mixture of red and blue but @entity266 have always been my first team			0
@entity287 , because he is one of the greatest sportsman who ever lived , because he had political convictions and because he was not afraid to say what he thought			0
@entity291 because there was a mystery about him as well as the fact that he was a sublimely talented driver			0
i had been lined up to do an interview with him at the @entity297 @entity249 in 1994 but he was killed a few weeks earlier at @entity298			0
@entity299 , because her gold medal run in @entity301 in 2000 is my most vivid @entity303 memory and because i admired the way she represented indigenous @entity252			0
@entity305 , because i ’ve always been fascinated by his legend			0
@entity307 because he was my idol when i was growing up			0
sir @entity309 , because i feel like i owe him a lot , i always felt privileged to be in his company and it would be lovely to see him again			0
that ’s one of the toughest questions to ask a sports writer because there are so many great one - off sporting occasions that are a huge thrill to attend and make you feel incredibly lucky to be doing the job			1
i ’d put the @entity320 up there , although it is somewhat reduced now			0
the @entity38 final always feels highly charged and there is always an adrenaline rush about covering a big world title fight			0
i was lucky enough to be at the @entity326 for the @entity156 final last year and covering that match in @entity60 was as good as it gets for a football fan			0
but if i had to plump for one event , i ’d say the @entity332			0
i ’d choose that because i have always loved tennis and when i was a kid i thought it was an impossible dream that i might one day be able to be on @entity335 to watch the men ’s final			0
it felt like something that was totally out of reach , something inaccessible and exotic that i could never even hope to gain entrance to			0
so every time i have been to a men ’s final , i have felt incredibly fortunate			0
i still ca n’t get past the wonder of being at that event			0
i ’ve got a picture on my wall at home of @entity349 at the moment he won the final in 2013 and i can pick myself out in the crowd in the background			0
that was right up there with the most memorable sporting events i have ever seen			0
