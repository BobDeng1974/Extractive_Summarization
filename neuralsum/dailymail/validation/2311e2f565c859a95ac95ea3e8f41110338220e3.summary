@entity0 describes himself as ‘ 50 - 50 ’ @entity2 and @entity3 , though the soft @entity5 accent seems a giveaway			1
it is n’t quite as simple as that , because @entity0 is the son of @entity8 , 1980 @entity10 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of @entity2 sport , whose rivalry with @entity14 captivated a global audience			1
three decades on , @entity0 is forging his own path — but as a cyclist , not a runner , having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with @entity21 , the 2013 @entity22 winner , and recently signed with @entity24 ’s top development team			1
cyclist @entity0 is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father @entity27 @entity28 spent his first seven years in @entity29 , where his parents moved after @entity8 ’s retirement , and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 — by coincidence , the year @entity0 was born			1
@entity0 knows little about his father ’s brief cycling career , and laughs as he says : ‘ i can imagine him rocking up , thinking he was stronger than anyone			1
’ but he knows everything about his running : ‘ my depth of knowledge about the history of athletics is more than my dad ’s			2
i have to correct him sometimes on what he did and did n’t do			2
’ @entity0 and his father @entity8 hit the running track , somewhere @entity8 is very familiar with father and son are cut from the same cloth			1
‘ we ’re so , so close , and so similar , ’ he says			2
that augurs well for @entity0 and badly for opponents , since the older @entity0 , now 59 , was famously competitive			1
he was equally famously prickly with the press — a trait that does n’t seem to have been inherited by the genial , open @entity28			2
had social media existed in the 1980s , it ’s difficult to imagine @entity8 asking a journalist to publish his @entity62 handle ( it ’s @ freddyovett , since you ask )			1
@entity0 recently signed with @entity24 ’s top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike @entity0 was a promising middle - distance runner , just like his dad , and in 2012 won a scholarship to the @entity71			1
then he suffered a knee injury			2
‘ it was so frustrating			2
i came back to @entity3 and did a bit of cycling to keep in shape , ’ he says			2
tests at the @entity78 suggested he had promise			2
‘ i think i was meant to be a cyclist all along , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ i always followed it , i was always staying up to stupid hours watching the @entity22			0
it fascinated me , despite the scandals			0
i was a big fan of @entity83 before the whole downfall			0
’ medals : 800m @entity10 gold , 1500m bronze ( 1980 ) ; 1500m @entity88 gold ( 1978 ) ; 800m @entity88 silver ( 1974 , 1978 ) ; 5,000m @entity90 gold ( 1986 )			1
world records ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat @entity14 ’s record battled with @entity14 for the mile record in 1981 — it changed hands three times in nine days set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983 set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years @entity0 was also @entity99 in 1978 what did his father make of him turning his back on running ? ‘ when i started cycling , we were n’t speaking , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ it was a strange time , it lasted about a year , which was tough on both of us			0
’ his parents are divorced and while his mother is still in @entity111 , @entity5 , his father lives down in @entity112 with his new partner			0
‘ when i went to @entity88 last year , my dad and i got back in contact , ’ @entity0 continues			1
‘ he sees the way athletics is at the moment and he saw how difficult it was for me to break through			0
‘ he ’s super supportive about my cycling — and excited more than anything			0
when i speak to him i can sense that			0
’ @entity0 has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father @entity8 one of the challenges in athletics , says @entity28 , is dealing with doping , which — surprisingly — he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one			1
‘ @entity133 has taken more of an aggressive approach in trying to stamp it out , ’ he claims			0
‘ in athletics , a lot of dodgy stuff is going on that the general public are not aware of , because they ’re not knowledgeable enough			0
’ @entity0 , 21 , is based in @entity141 in the @entity142 , in an apartment owned by his new team , @entity145			1
they are as @entity24 as cycling teams come , but manager , @entity148 , a top rider in the 1980s , was interested in a rider called @entity0			1
‘ he was a fan of my dad ’s , ’ says @entity0			2
@entity151 and @entity0 during the heats of the men 's 1500 metres event at the @entity155 in 1984 he shares an apartment with a @entity24 rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner			1
the team is paying for @entity24 classes — he goes to school for three hours a day			1
the question of his nationality is unresolved			0
enquiries were made about him riding for @entity167 at last year ’s @entity168 , but he is undecided			0
‘ i have dual citizenship			0
i do n’t want to rush anything , ’ he explains			0
he is wary of declaring for @entity2 or @entity3 when he feels he has n’t proved himself deserving of a place in either national team			2
@entity8 was a 1980 @entity10 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of @entity2 sport ‘ i need to learn in under 23 racing before trying to be a hero , ’ he says			1
‘ but i ’m definitely not opposed to representing the @entity2			0
’ what does his dad think ? ‘ i do n’t know , he ’s good at letting me feel my own way			0
he ’s trying to not put too much pressure on me			0
both ( @entity2 and @entity3 ) set - ups are really good — both have incredibly strong national teams			0
’ last year , during his first racing trip to @entity88 , @entity0 stayed with his agent , @entity188 , in @entity189 , which is also where @entity21 and his @entity191 team - mate @entity190 live			1
@entity0 , 21 , is based in @entity141 in the @entity142 , in an apartment owned by his new team , @entity145 ‘ it was fantastic , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i went on quite a few rides with @entity190 and got on really well with him — he checks up on me			0
and i rode with @entity21 , including one ride where he was training for the @entity197			2
‘ he is such a nice guy and i read a bit about him — he is like this @entity201 @entity200 warrior , extremely talented but he could n’t get a handle on how to race			0
‘ i do n’t compare myself with him but i can relate to that			0
i feel strong enough to make up for my poor bunch racing skills , but i know i ’ve got so much to learn			0
’ @entity0 was a promising middle - distance runner and in 2012 won a scholarship to the @entity71			1
