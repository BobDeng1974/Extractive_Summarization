@entity2 , of @entity10 , @entity11 , said her daughter dared her to have it done over lunch and she was in the tattoo parlour within hours			1
an artist etched the basic outline on her skin and it was gradually filled in during the weeks leading up to @entity5			0
mrs @entity2 , who is known in the area for her penchant for dying her hair unusual colours , conceded that the tattoo was a bid to retain her youth			1
' it does make you feel younger , ' she said			0
' i suppose one of the main reasons i got it is that we do n’t have a car anymore , we ca n’t go on holidays like we used to anymore , we ca n’t dance like we used to , so what am i going to with myself ? ' she said she and her husband @entity36 , 89 , who served on the harrowing @entity37 during the @entity38 , were slowing down and she needed new things to occupy her time			2
' the real reason i went was that my middle daughter dared me to get it done , ' added mrs @entity2			1
' she dared me at dinner - time and by the afternoon i was in there			1
' mrs @entity2 chose her image and a butterfly was drawn on her arm by an artist at @entity50 in @entity10			2
' i ’m proud of it , ' she added			0
' you would n’t believe it , but i ’m actually a very shy person			0
but i was n’t going to get one where people could n’t see it , was i ? ' careful : an outline was drawn on to her skin and then filled in over several weeks , to avoid any adverse reaction surprise ! mrs @entity2 did n't tell her husband @entity36 , 89 , what she was planning until it was done the great - grandmother said she had always liked the idea of getting a tattoo but it simply was n’t an option for women when she was growing up			1
' when i was younger we did n’t have this sort of thing , ' she said			0
' i always say that if i was young now , i ’d either be a goth or one those hippy people			2
' while mrs @entity2 is happy to show off her new artwork now , she was not brave enough to tell her husband her plans until it was too late			1
' she came home and it was done , ' mr @entity80 said			0
' but i do n’t mind , i love her			0

' despite eagerly waiting for some warm weather so she can better show off the design , mrs @entity2 said there would be no more tattoos to follow			2
' no , this is it , ' she said			0
' everybody i ’ve shown has liked it - even my elderly neighbours around here			2
' my 11 - year - old great - grandson likes it the most , though			1
