mothers love them , babies love them , even the family dog loves them - and if you were to peek into the average @entity7 family 's linen closet , you would no doubt find one			1
the very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most @entity11 hospitals is so popular amongst new parents that they often choose not to give them back			1
a spokesperson from the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) in @entity16 admitted that it was a common phenomenon that the blankets simply disappeared			2
the very first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most @entity11 hospitals is so popular amongst parents that they often choose not to give them back ' it 's one of those unfortunate things that happen , some mother really do like them - they just go into the suitcase an no one is any the wiser , ' she told @entity29			1
' there 's nothing special about them , but they are quite thick and warm for new born babies			0
it 's just a fact of life that they go walk about			0
' but for some mothers , the pink , white and blue striped blankets mean the whole world			0
' my daughter was in the @entity47 after she was born , so we spent almost a week in the hospital , ' @entity16 mother - of - one , @entity43 said			0
' she was a winter baby , so the blanket kept her nice and warm and cosy ! she was wrapped in it when we took her home and it 's now a lovely memento of the first few days of her life			2
' @entity55 , who works for the linen supplier @entity57 , said the company sends at least 300 of the baby blankets out to numerous @entity11 hospitals each day however , at least one third never make it back for laundering , mr @entity55 said other mothers have admitted to sneaking the blankets to their pets in order to accustom them to their newborn 's smell and encourage a positive relationship between them			1
one mum told @entity75 that her child 's hospital baby blanket was tucked in beside her father - in - law who had died only a few weeks after proudly becoming a grandfather			2
each day over 300 of the baby blankets are delivered to a variety of public hospitals , and a few private hospitals , across @entity11 by @entity57			1
many mothers , like @entity43 , admit the take the blankets as a memento of their child 's birth but when they 're sent back to the linen provider for laundering , at least one third are missing according to @entity55 , the senior customer service relationship coordinator at @entity57			1

@entity103 , the midwifery unit manager at @entity16 's @entity15 , said blankets are not the only thing that often go missing in hospitals , adding that hand sanitiser was another popular item but baby blankets are not the only hospital items that are likely to be found in a patient 's home			1
' i think it 's just like how we use this hand rub here in the hospital and we lose quite a lot of that , ' @entity103 , the midwifery unit manager at @entity15 , told @entity29			0
' people just seem to think that because we use it at the hospital , that 's the way to go			0
' parents also take the blankets , but i do n't know why â€“ they 're ugly ! although one of the reasons they might be taken is because people do n't often come to hospitals prepared to take their newborn home and so when they are taking the baby home , they do n't have anything to wrap them in and just take the blanket			1
' we have had them sent back to us all laundered and with a thank you note , or sometimes the midwives in our home service program bring them back			0

the first blanket that each newborn is wrapped in at most @entity11 hospitals often gets taken home by parents

a spokesperson for the hospital 's linen provider , @entity57 , said at least 300 baby blankets get sent out to hospitals in @entity11 each day
