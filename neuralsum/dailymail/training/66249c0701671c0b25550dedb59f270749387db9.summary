by @entity0 published : 02:08 est , 6 december 2013 @entity2 : 14:19 est , 6 december 2013 the developer behind 2013 ’s hottest mobile app has revealed the secrets to his success			1
@entity9 ceo @entity8 ’s @entity7 is a runaway success that has overtaken the @entity12 ’s games charts and has over 3.5million registered users only three weeks since being released			1
brainchild : the app has been developed by @entity9 ceo @entity8 , pictured @entity7 is a trivia game modeled after @entity17 that allows people to compete in specific categories against friends or anyone else around the world			1
mr @entity8 detailed his creative process to @entity24			2
the most important key to any app is to build on an existing idea , the @entity26 - based executive said , explaining that games such as @entity31 and draw something took an offline game and made it addictive			1
@entity7 ’s success comes from its simplicity			1
mr @entity8 designed the game to be simple and intuitive , but also familiar			2
‘ having gameplay that ’s familiar to you is a huge advantage , because you can get right into the game , ’ he explained			2
‘ we do n’t have an onboarding mechanism			2
’ once gamers have opened the app they can just select a category and begin answering questions			1
there are no gimmicks like other games commonly have , just trivia			1
‘ you get to a level , it ’s addicting , but in order to continue you need to share it or ask your friends for help , ’ the @entity52 native said about smash success @entity53			1
‘ we do n’t really reward people at all for sharing			2
’ if the game 's success has been simple and sudden , @entity8 's rise to fame has not been			1
rather than some overnight success , the tech entrepreneur studied at @entity74 before working his way up through various leading telecommunication firms			1
and selling his trivia plan was n't a walk in the park either			0
' it … was n’t easy , ' he told techcrunch			0
' i thought i ’d just charm my way in front of these vcs , share my big idea for a quiz platform , and they ’d throw money my way			0
' ' just connecting with the right people was a challenge			0
i ’d cold call and ask for meetings , and they ’d maybe be willing to set something up for 2 , 3 months later			0
i had to be creative to get in front of these vcs			0
it maybe even bordered on stalking			0
in hindsight , maybe it was a bit creepy			0
' since it 's launch on november 7 @entity7 has signed more than 1.5 million users playing more than 70 million games - quickly dominating @entity107 's download charts			1
players soon start ramping up experience points ( @entity110 ) and begin ranking in their city or state in specific categories and post those achievements online			0
those postings are what has led to the game ’s remarkable organic growth			0
‘ most of the new players are coming through @entity121 and @entity123 shares , ’ mr @entity8 explained			0
‘ they ’re proud of being no. 1 in their state in botany , or something			0
’ beautiful simplicity : the game is easy to use and intuitive the latest mobile app mastermind also learned a lesson from other successful apps , do n’t fragment			1
developers are not releasing multiple versions of the game , they have instead provided users the ability to upload their own questions to the game from within the app. there are over 200,000 currently in the app , but that number grows daily			1
comparison : players can compare their performance against friends and others ‘ you have to be able to constantly refresh content , ’ said mr @entity8			0
having the app only on @entity63 has also made it successful , according to the executive			1
‘ it 's made it a kind of status symbol , ’ he said			2
‘ if there ’s one person in a school or university who gets the game , there are twenty the next day , and the next day , everyone who has an @entity63 has it			0
' an android version is coming next month , @entity24 noted			0
the firm with just 30 employees now has $ 1.2million in venture funding and have made the gamble to drop all their other projects to purely focus on @entity7			1
' we ’ve evolved from being a game studio that has multiple titles into just being @entity7 , ' he told the magazine although admitting he knows trends can be fickle			1
' it ’s every man ’s dream to have a hit product			0
' the game also does n’t try to force players to open their wallets to generate income like many other games do , it instead partners with brands for sponsored categories			2
the final piece to the success puzzle was making it a quasi-social network			2
each category has its own message board that users can have discussions about various topics on			2
mr @entity8 readily admitted to the magazine that some of the discussions are ‘ just noise ’ but also said topics like physics have ‘ really intellectual discussions			0

@entity7 was modeled after @entity17
it is currently at the top of the @entity12 's games category
the app 's creator believes its success comes from simplicity and familiarity
