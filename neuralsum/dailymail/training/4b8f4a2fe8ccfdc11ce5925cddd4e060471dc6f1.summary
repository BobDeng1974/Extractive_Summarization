by @entity0 published : 05:40 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 05:40 est , 7 june 2013 prospective house - buyers are now as drawn in by high - spec interior features such as underfloor heating and marble floors as they are by proximity to good schools when looking for a new home			1
our taste for grander and grander designs means we are being enticed through sellers ' doors by granite kitchen surfaces , elaborate home entertainment systems , walk - in wardrobes and @entity17 - and savvy estate agents are focusing on these buzzwords to prick up our ears			1
property listings are increasingly mentioning ' high - spec interiors ' , and of those which do the most common feature is underfloor heating ( 63 per cent ) , while over a quarter ( 27 per cent ) boast of quality finishes such as granite work surfaces and marble flooring			1
high - spec interiors such as @entity17 , marble floors , granite work tops and elaborate entertainment systems are enticing home buyers more and more other high - spec features noted include ceiling speakers ( two per cent ) and luxury fittings such as walk - in wardrobes and built - in entertainment centres ( one per cent )			1
the kudos of premium brands is also important , with two per cent of high spec homes listing either @entity42 or @entity44 appliances as part of their marketed qualities			1
the research was compiled by insurance firm @entity49 , who found that of the five million plus properties for sale in the @entity53 , some 257,000 are now described as having a ' high - spec interior '			1
the analysis also showed that while ' ambience ' remains an important factor for selling properties ( mentioned in nearly two per cent of the five million listings analysed ) , estate agents are advocating the serene locations of flats and houses for sale , above their proximity to lively bars , cafes and restaurants			2
would you buy a home for its proximity to good local schools , or for its ability to properly catalogue your clothes in a walk - in wardrobe ? in nearly two - fifths ( 61 per cent ) of homes described as having ' ambient features ' , the peaceful and tranquil location is highlighted , compared to only one in ten that mention local or country pubs ( 13 per cent )			2
and despite the rise of local independent coffee chains , only 300 ambient properties list café culture as a selling point , and two thirds ( 72 per cent ) of those mentions are located in @entity90			0
interestingly , where schools are mentioned as a key feature , homes in the @entity92 are most likely to use proximity as a selling point , while in the @entity99 schools are only referenced as a selling point for two per cent of homes			1
where schools are mentioned as a key feature , homes in the @entity92 are most likely to use proximity as a selling point , while in the @entity99 schools are only referenced as a selling point for two per cent of homes within the results for ' garden features ' , 12 per cent of properties in @entity90 list a garden as a main quality			1
over a quarter ( 28 per cent ) offer a large garden , and seven per cent offer a ' beautiful or attractive garden '			0
the most favoured was a south - facing garden , featuring in over half ( 55 per cent ) of property descriptions in the capital			0
transportation is one of the less important features ( mentioned in less than one per cent of the five million analysed listings ) , almost three quarters ( 72 per cent ) of homes that reference transportation state that they are ideally located for an easy commute			0
within this feature category , homes in the @entity130 ( five per cent ) , @entity131 ( five per cent ) and the @entity99 ( four per cent ) are least likely to list transport links			2
in nearly two - fifths of homes described as having ' ambient features ' , the peaceful and tranquil location is highlighted , compared to only one in ten that mention local or country pubs commenting on the research , @entity142 , director of home insurance at @entity49 said : ' we all fall in love with properties for different reasons , and while the character and charm of a home is a matter of personal taste , it seems that assets such as smart flooring and on - trend kitchen brands are as important to some buyers as transport links and schools			2
' and with the pace of life so fast for many of us , it ’s not surprising that home buyers are looking for a little refuge from their busy working lives and would prefer tranquillity to buzzing bars and local pubs			0
' but whether you plump for marble flooring or laminate , walk - in wardrobe or flat - packed furniture make sure you can also afford to maintain the perfect home once you find it			0
' and if you ’re lucky enough to get some swanky fixtures and fittings as part of the purchase , ensure you tell your home insurer so you can be certain you have the right cover to protect everything in your new home			0
' the most favoured was a south - facing garden , featuring in over half ( 55 per cent ) of property descriptions in the capital			0
