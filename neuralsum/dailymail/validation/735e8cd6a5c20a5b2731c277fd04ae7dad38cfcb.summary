rescue centers are struggling to cope with a mystery surge in the numbers of starving sea lion pups which have washed up on @entity5 shores since january			1
more than 1,100 starving and sick pups have been rescued from @entity8 's beaches , as well as public bathrooms , behind buildings and along railroad tracks since the beginning of the year			1
the number is almost five times higher than the 250 pups which would usually be expected in the key monitoring period between january and april - and no one knows why			1
his center , in @entity26 , is currently rehabilitating 115 sea lion pups			1
on a recent day , over the course of two hours , five suffering animals came in			0
one was brought in by a police officer , three more came in with an animal control team and the fifth was called in by a couple walking along beach			0
the last pup , at almost a year old , weighed just 23 pounds - a third of what it should have			0
it was so ill , staff had no choice but to put it down			0
@entity39 explained pups that should be gaining 20 to 40 pounds in a two - month period have put on just two pounds			1
' these animals are coming in really desperate			0
they 're at the end of life			0
they 're in a crisis ... and not all animals are going to make it , ' he said			0
feeding : once rescued , pups who are healthy enough to be saved are fed formula to help them put on weight volunteer : @entity76 carries a just - rescued sea lion pup into a holding pen after feeding it surgery : dr @entity81 , center , and veterinarian technician @entity83 , right , prepare an injured sea lion for eye surgery at @entity30 's @entity86 , in @entity29 an hour down the coast , the situation is so bad that @entity30 , in @entity29 , suspended its sea lion show so it can focus on rescue efforts			1
the theme park has treated 400 pups - more than twice the number it would care for in a typical year - and constructed two temporary pools to house them			1
scientists are n't sure what 's causing the crisis , but suspect that warmer waters from this winter 's mild @entity100 weather pattern are impacting the sea lion birthing grounds along the @entity103 off the @entity8 coast			1
the warm water is likely pushing prime sea lion foods - market squid , sardines and anchovies - further north , forcing the mothers to abandon their pups for up to eight days at a time in search of sustenance			1
dying : a starving pup , weighing a third of what it should have done , looks out from a playpen at the @entity120			2
it later had to be put down , so weak it could not be saved stronger : once pups get stronger , they graduate from formula to whole fish , and are playfully called ' feeders ' while those that can once more compete for fish tossed into a pool are called ' fighters			2
' washed up : pups have been found in public washrooms , behind buildings and on railway tracks the pups , scientists believe , are weaning themselves early out of desperation and setting out on their own despite being underweight and ill - prepared to hunt			2
' they 're leaving with a very low tank of gas and when they get over here , they 're showing up on the beach basically ... starving to death , ' said @entity146 , a coordinator with the @entity148 's @entity147			1
for rescue centers like @entity40 , that translates into round - the - clock , back - breaking work for dozens of volunteers who 've arrived from all over the @entity154 to help			1
the center in one of @entity8 's premiere beach communities has rescued more than 213 pups since the beginning of the year and has treated ones that weighed as little as 14 pounds at eight - months - old			1
volunteers have been arriving from all over the @entity154 to help with the escalating crisis			0
crates holding animals awaiting assessment are crammed into every corner , including the laundry room , as those already housed in communal pens barked and bleated in a deafening racket as mealtime approached			0
warming : the surge could be down to rising sea temperatures , pushing the sea lion 's normal food north listed : the names of the rescued sea lion pups at the @entity40 overwhelmed : the @entity40 currently has 115 sea lion pups - far more than usual release : they hope to get them healthy enough to set free , tracking some to monitor their progress each incoming pup has its temperature taken and is weighed , measured and given a blood sugar test before the team decides if they can save it			1
most of them are so weak they barely resist			0
those that make the cut are tube - fed a gruel of pureed herring , @entity196 , vitamins and milk three or four times a day after starting out with a simple broth of hydrating fluids and dextrose			0
those that graduate to whole fish are playfully called ' feeders ' and those that can once more compete for fish tossed into a pool are called ' fighters			0
' the goal is to get the pups strong enough to swim free again - but the volunteers who nurse them back to health may never know if they make it in the wild			2
only a handful will be fitted with expensive tracking devices			0
the rest are tagged with a number and fall off the radar unless they are rescued again			2
' the tricky part is we 're putting them back into the same environment that they just came from			0
and that 's going to be a challenge for them , ' @entity146 said .			2

more than 1,100 starving or sick sea lion pups rescued since january
rescue centers would usually expect to only see about 250 in the period
situation so dire @entity8 's @entity30 has suspended its sea lion show
*famous* *attraction* treating 400 pups in two specially constructed pools
rising sea temperatures could be one cause of the surge in numbers
