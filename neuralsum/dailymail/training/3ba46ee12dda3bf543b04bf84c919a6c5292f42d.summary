by @entity0 they say there ’s no greater happiness than having children			0
but if research is to be believed , the truth is rather less optimistic			0
spending time with your nearest and dearest makes us far less happy than being with our friends , according to a survey			1
in fact , researchers found only the company of work colleagues and clients is more @entity17 at the @entity18 collated data from smartphone users who used an app to log their levels of happiness over a three - year period			1
spending time with your family makes you far less happy than being with friends according to new research the @entity29 app , designed by academic @entity30 with the @entity18 , works by sending alerts to users at random intervals , asking them how happy and relaxed they were feeling at that moment , what they were doing and who they were with			1
around 50,000 people have downloaded the app , logging three million responses			1
on average , respondents ’ moods improved by more than 8 per cent when they were with friends , but this fell to 5.9 per cent when with their partners			1
and happiness levels rose by just 1.4 per cent when with their children – less than walking , going to the library and drinking alcohol			2
this result was only slightly higher than the 0.7 per cent improvement in mood when they were with clients or customers at work			1
the results surprised those who took part			0
@entity57 , 49 , an architect from @entity58 in @entity59 , said : ‘ the results were not as i expected , as they suggested i was happiest when alone and outdoors , which does not typically represent the life of a full - time working architect , mother of two young boys and generally busy person			2
’ the results have been reported by researchers from the @entity18 , who collated data from tens of thousands of smartphone users , who used an app to log their levels of happiness over a three year period			1
the activity which makes us happiest is sex , which raised moods by an average of 14 per cent the results stunned those who took part , who were not aware of how much less happy they felt when at home			1
the study attempted to record how happy people genuinely feel in specific moments , rather than how they view how happy they were in retrospect , which can be distorted			1
researchers did this by using an app titled @entity94 , which was developed by academic @entity30 in conjunction with the @entity18			1
about 50,000 people have signed up to use it since 2010			2
after downloading the app , users received randomly generated ‘ dings ’ on their phones , which would ask them how happy and relaxed they were feeling at that moment , what they were doing and who they were with			1
only responses received within an hour were included in the data			0
analysis of the replies , of which there are now 3million , shows people are far happier when with their friends than with family			1
the activity which makes us happiest is sex , which raised moods by an average of 14 per cent			1
researchers , moreover , believe this to be an understatement because people are unlikely to reach for their phones during the act			2
other activities which rated highly were going to the theatre or a concert , visiting anexhibition , museum or library , sports and gardening			0
people who work in an office were twice as unhappy as those who work from home at the other end of the spectrum , being sick in bed made us most depressed , reducing mood by 20.4 per cent			1
friends 8.2 % spouse / partner 5.9 % other family 2.9 % children 1.4 % clients / customers 0.7 % colleagues / classmates 0.6 % * percentage improvement in mood , compared to being alone working or studying is also a downer , lowering levels of happiness by 5.4 per cent relative to other activities			1
people who work in an office were twice as unhappy as those who work from home and men were found to be less happy at work than women			2
those who are least happy at work are those in long - term relationships , but those with childre were not quite so upset to be away from home and in the office			2
working conditions , of course , vary widely and this was reflected in levels of wellbeing			0
people who earned less than £ 12,000 a year were far happier when at work than those with higher wages			2
shifters who work before 6am , after 6pm or at the weekend were twice as unhappy as those who have more stable hours during the day			0
being sick in bed made us most depressed , reducing mood by 20.4 per cent @entity174 , who conducted the research , told the @entity176 : ‘ even though people are positive about paid work when reflecting on the meaning and value of their lives , actually engaging in paid work comes at some personal cost in terms of the pressures and stress they face			1
‘ wellbeing at work varies significantly with your circumstances and these can be influenced by public policies to facilitate “ happier ” working conditions			0
’ another study by the @entity195 in @entity196 suggests it is possible to make ourselves feel happier			0
though it is generally assumed that you need goals to lead a happy life , evidence is mixed			0

leading an active life is believed to be the key to happiness			0
' in order to have a happy life , a rewarding life you need to be active			0
so involvement is more important to happiness than meaning in the sense of why , why we are here			0
' research has shown that we can make ourselves happier because happiness changes over time			0
these changes are not just a matter of better circumstances but of better dealing with life			0
elderly people tend to be wiser and for that reason , happier			0
' studies collated by the database say you tend to be happier if you are in a long - term relationship , are actively engaged in politics , are active in work and in your free time , go out for dinner and have close friendships although happiness does not increase with the number of friends you have			2
a @entity271 study ( by @entity272 and @entity273 published in 2004 ) found a strong link between time spent commuting and satisfaction with life			0
those who spent an hour on their journey to work were found to be significantly less happy that those who did not commute .			0
