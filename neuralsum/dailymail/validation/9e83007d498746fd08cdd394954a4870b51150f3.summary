@entity1 manager @entity0 decided to watch his side 's match against @entity4 from the window of a nearby house after being hit with a six - match stadium ban			1
@entity0 , who was handed a lengthy ban after admitting a @entity10 charge relating to his conduct , ensured he watched @entity1 's 3 - 2 win on saturday by peering out of the window of a house belonging to the club 's groundsman			2
luckily for the @entity18 boss , @entity1 's groundsman lives just yards away from the club 's home ground			2
@entity1 boss @entity0 watches his side 's match against @entity4 from a skylight window @entity0 decided to watch the match from groundman @entity25 's house due to his six - match stadium ban the @entity1 boss pokes his head out of the groundsman 's window as his players take on @entity32 @entity1 's groundsman lives just yards away from the club 's home ground - his house is circled above the @entity1 boss , speaking to the @entity35 , said of his view : ' i can pretty much see the whole pitch apart from the goalmouth at the end i watch it from			1
it is quite a good vantage point but being detached from the players makes life difficult			0
' i did not realise the significance of it at first , it just did not sink in			0
it is only the passage of time and games that makes you fully understand what it involves and just how much you @entity55 ' thankfully , @entity58 ( @entity57 , assistant manager ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 , goalkeeper coach ) and the players have been relatively unaffected by it so they deserve all the credit			0
the personal difficulty for me is secondary			0
' @entity0 , who was given a six - match stadium ban for remonstrating with referee @entity66 following @entity68 ' 1 - 0 defeat by @entity69 on january 17 , has just one game left to serve of his punishment			1
he will be hoping for a similar vantage point on tuesday when @entity1 take on @entity73 in the second leg of the @entity76 final			0
assistant manager @entity57 took charge of @entity1 in the absence of the suspended @entity0 @entity80 was hit with a six - match stadium ban over comments he made to referee @entity66			1
