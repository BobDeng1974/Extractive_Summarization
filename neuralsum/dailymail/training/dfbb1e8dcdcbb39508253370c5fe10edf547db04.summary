internet users say the @entity3 postal service 's new uniform is far from a first - class look , claiming that it resembles the clothing worn by @entity7 soldiers			1
images of the uniforms were uploaded to @entity10 on tuesday , with many users drawing comparisons between them and the foreboding outfits that @entity15 's feared @entity7 squadron members wore			1
both uniforms appear to share the same dark colouring and angular badges and braiding on the lapel and cuffs			1
however , @entity35 , a spokesman for @entity25 , strenuously denied that the uniforms look the same , claiming that internet users had deliberately darkened the photos of the postal uniforms			1
according to the @entity41 , he told the @entity43 news agency : ' the uniform of postal management staff is dark blue , [ but ] office staff wear a lighter colour			1
the uniforms in the photographs distributed online have simply been retouched to look black			1
' he added that the design takes its inspiration from army uniforms that date back to the rule of @entity56 , the @entity57 between 1721 and 1725			2
a spokesman for @entity25 strenuously denied that the uniforms look the same claiming that internet users had deliberately darkened the photos of the postal uniforms a portrait of @entity7 chief @entity64 , dressed in his uniform last year @entity3 president @entity66 defended @entity68 's deal with @entity15 to divide up @entity69 in 1939 because the @entity69 did the same thing with the @entity71 in 1938			1
he said it was important that @entity3 academics were involved in attempts to re-write the history of the 20th century so the impact of the @entity77 was not forgotten			1
@entity66 said : ' we had the so - called @entity79 in 1938			2
and what is it ? the @entity82 hushed it up			2
' @entity84 arrived , shook his paper and said , ' i brought you peace ' when he returned to @entity91 after the talks			2
to which @entity93 , i believe , in private , stated , ' well , now the war is inevitable			2
' ' because appeasement of the aggressor , which @entity98 was , would clearly lead to a major future military conflict , and some people understood that			0
there should be a deep multilateral study of what was happening before @entity105 ' @entity66 attempted to claim there was a difference between the @entity79 and the non-aggression deal between the @entity77 and @entity98			0
he said : ' for example , there are still arguments about the @entity112 , and the @entity77 is blamed for dividing @entity69			0
but what did @entity69 itself do , when the @entity113 invaded @entity116 ? it took part of @entity116			0
and then , in turn , the same thing happened to @entity69			0
' i do not want to blame anyone here , but serious studies should show that these were the foreign policy methods at the time			0
the @entity77 signed a non-aggression agreement with @entity98			0
they say , ' oh , how bad			0
' but what is so bad about it , if the @entity77 did not want to fight ? what is so bad ? ' he also said it was necessary to compare the 25 million victims in the @entity77 to the combined allied losses .			0
