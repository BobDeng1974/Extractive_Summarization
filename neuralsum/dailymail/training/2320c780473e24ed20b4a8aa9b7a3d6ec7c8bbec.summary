some glass still remains embedded in the eye , as with her chest and abdomen , as doctors thought it too risky to remove			2
mrs @entity10 , who lives in a ranch - style house just outside of @entity13 with her husband @entity97 , said that she has worked various blue - collar jobs throughout the years at steel mills , but that medical bills have slowly mounted			1

the mayor of @entity13 , @entity171 , said at the time that while he appreciates the depth of mrs @entity10 ’s suffering , the city is simply not able to cut her a check for her pain			1
though @entity177 is mulling over whether to award the @entity178 to the four girls who were killed , the brother of @entity17 , @entity35 , told the @entity42 that he too is not interested in the medal , @entity177 ' highest honor .			1
