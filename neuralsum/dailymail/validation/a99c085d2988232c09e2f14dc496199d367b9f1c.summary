eminent psychologist dr. @entity0 , known to tv audiences as @entity2 , is on his way to @entity4 , @entity5 to help the beleaguered boyfriend of @entity7 , @entity8 has learned exclusively			1
on the eve of @entity7 ’s 22nd birthday yesterday @entity11 , whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted , “ i ’m so hurt i wan na do myself in , i know i have to strong [ sic ]			1
’ in an insight into his spiraling mental state , on tuesday he tweeted ‘ you all blame me but i tried my best and it was n’t good enough sorry			0
‘ earlier he tweeted the simple plea to @entity7 , ‘ i love you soooooooo much plz wake up			2
’ through it all , he has not been allowed to visit with her , as tensions between @entity11 and the @entity25 family have escalated on the edge : @entity11 was seen on outside @entity27 near @entity4 , where @entity7 was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub a helping hand : dr. @entity2 is concerned about @entity11 and his on his way to offer assistance it is five weeks since @entity7 was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the @entity36 , @entity5 , home she and @entity11 , 25 , shared			1
the only daughter of @entity38 and @entity25 has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother ’s death in eerily similar circumstances			1
the singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near @entity48 on 11 february 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre grammy awards party			0
but unlike @entity52 ’s death that was ruled accidental , police are treating @entity7 ’s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21 - year - old as a criminal investigation			1
two weeks after being admitted to @entity4 ’s @entity57 was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection			0
instead she was given a tracheotomy			0
but any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures			0
while @entity7 fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with @entity11 , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged			1
it was @entity11 who found @entity7 and who was administering cpr when first responders arrived on the scene			1
but other than this , few details have emerged			0
there have been reports that @entity7 was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub			2
@entity11 and @entity7 in happier times			1
@entity11 has been banned from seeing her by the @entity25 family in addition to this she had been using cocaine , heroin and @entity97 in the months before the january 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to people			1
just two weeks ago @entity11 was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the @entity7 and his @entity5 home – a home owned by @entity38 until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining @entity109 footage from security cameras located at the @entity36 residence			1
lawyers for @entity11 had tried to argue that the warrant issued on february 12 was an infringement of their client ’s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case			1
meanwhile the nature of @entity11 and @entity7 ’s union has come under intense scrutiny			1
both have referred to each other as ‘ husband ’ and ‘ wife ’ in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that @entity11 – who was unofficially adopted into the family by @entity38 when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ‘ sister			1
’ in his most recent tweets @entity11 who had previously called @entity7 his ‘ wife ’ refers to her as his ‘ fiancée			1
’ what is clear is that , in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left @entity7 fighting for her life , her life had become increasingly chaotic			2
just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver @entity142 and drove headlong into a gray @entity143			0
the driver of the @entity145 and a passenger in her jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at @entity36 , @entity5			0
@entity11 too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months			2
police were also called to her home on january 23 after reports of a fight there			0
a security guard at the gated community where @entity7 lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ‘ hitting each other and swinging ’ outside the three - bedroom townhouse			2
officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation			0
speaking to @entity8 a former boyfriend of @entity7 who remains a close friend , @entity170 gave an insight into the torrid pair			2
he said : ‘ @entity11 has a short temper and @entity7 can be difficult			1
‘ it was a tug of war , because they are both very stubborn people			0
@entity178 is very sweet , giving and caring , but she wants all of you , everything			0
‘ and @entity11 like space , that ’s where a lot of the tension between them came from			2
’ he revealed that @entity11 was ‘ getting a little wild			2
’ he said : ‘ he was getting into car accidents			0
he ’s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years			0
he ’s got a need for speed			0
he ’s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [ from @entity7 , sole inheritor of @entity38 ’s estate ] and crashing them life and right			2
‘ he had a couple of @entity201			0
he liked fast cars , @entity203 , that kind of thing			0
he cares , but he was n’t slowing down			0
’ against this backdrop , hostilities between @entity11 and @entity7 ’s father , @entity25 , and other family members have publicly exploded with @entity11 an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure			1
@entity11 has accused @entity25 of only being after his daughter ’s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return			1
@entity216 ’s aunt @entity52 is the executor @entity38 ’s estate estimated at between $ 12 and $ 20million trust she took out a restraining order against @entity11 in march citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in @entity7 because of her money			1
according to @entity225 the tweets , including one that read ‘ @entity228 i got bigger guns than you			0
watch them react to this , ’ were specifically aimed at threatening her			0
@entity225 , who was one of @entity38 ’s managers , has made no secret of her disapproval of @entity7 and @entity11 ’s ‘ sibling ’ relationship having turned into something romantic			1
in increasingly erratic tweets @entity11 has raged against singer @entity25 accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years			1
he has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both @entity38 , who struggled with drug abuse , and @entity7 fell on his shoulders and that , now just 25 , it was too great a duty to bear .			2
