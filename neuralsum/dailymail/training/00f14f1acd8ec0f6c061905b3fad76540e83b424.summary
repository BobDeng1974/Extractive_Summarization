the @entity0 has rushed to the defence of @entity3 's ' supergirl swimmer ' @entity4 , joining a chorus against a @entity8 coach 's claim that she may have turned to doping to boost her performance			1
the @entity0 is the latest agency to weigh in on the story of the swimming sensation , who captured the gold medal in the 400m individual medley on saturday , and at one point even besting the pace of male swimmer @entity16			1
miss @entity4 's performance led one @entity8 coach to call her gold medal - winning performance ' unbelievable ' and ' disturbing , ' and suggested doping may be behind it			1
scroll down for @entity0 reaction record breaker : @entity4 knocked five seconds off her personal best and broke the world record by more than a second as she stormed to gold in the 400m individual medley in the @entity29 beaten : @entity16 , pictured , was slower than @entity4 over the last 50 metres of his own medley race @entity31 , the @entity8 executive director of the @entity32 , described @entity4 's swim - who last night broke the @entity36 record in another event - as ' unbelievable ' and ' disturbing			1
' in response , @entity0 spokesman @entity38 said : ' we need to get real here			2
these are the world 's best athletes competing at the very highest level			2
' we 've seen all sorts of records broken already all over the place			0
' mr @entity38 ' remarks echoed those of the sport 's president , who said that suspicions that miss @entity4 doped were ' crazy ' and motivated by jealousy			2
@entity38 said the top five athletes in each event , plus two others , are tested as part of ' a very , very strong drug - testing program , and we are very confident if there are cheats we will catch them			2
' ' we ca n't stop speculation			0
it is inevitably a sad result of the fact that there are people who dope and who cheat , ' @entity38 said			0
' it 's very sad we ca n't applaud a great performance			0
let 's give the benefit of the doubt to the athletes			0
' @entity4 won the 400 - meter individual medley on the opening day of the @entity36 swimming competition , and captured another world record when she won the 200 intermediate yesterday			1
last night , a @entity3 anti-doping official hit back at the @entity8 , saying @entity3 never questioned @entity79 ' astonishing eight - gold medal run in the @entity80			1
@entity81 told the country 's @entity83 news agency that @entity31 's claims were completely unreasonable			2
he said : ' i think it is not proper to single @entity3 swimmers out once they produce good results			2
some people are just biased			0
we never questioned @entity79 when he bagged eight gold medals in @entity93			1
' his claims were backed by @entity96 boss lord @entity95 who said that @entity4 had passed all drug tests required of medal winners , and is ' clean '			1
lord @entity95 told reporters : ' she 's been through [ the @entity102 's ] program and she 's clean			0
that 's the end of the story			0
@entity4 deserves recognition for her talent			2
' outspoken : top @entity8 swimming coach @entity31 called the feat ' unbelievable ' @entity31 's claims came as anti-doping officials revealed that cleaners and security staff have been asked to spy on athletes in the @entity113 and report anything suspicious that could be linked to performance - enhancing drugs			1
miss @entity4 ’s gold medal came in the 400m individual medley , in which she swam the last 50m of the freestyle leg in 28.93 seconds – compared with the 29.1 seconds that 27 - year - old @entity8 @entity16 managed in the men ’s event minutes earlier			1
her time for the whole event was more than five seconds better than her previous best			0
pressed on the use of drugs she told the @entity134 last night : ‘ there is absolutely no problem with doping			2
the @entity3 have always had a firm policy about doping			2
my results come from hard work and training and i would never use any banned drugs			0
the @entity3 people have clean hands			2
’ but mr @entity31 compared the final 100m swum by @entity4 as being ‘ reminiscent ’ of some old @entity140 swimmers , several of whom were subsequently exposed for using performance - enhancing drugs			1
he said miss @entity4 looks like @entity142 , adding : ‘ any time someone has looked like @entity142 in the history of our sport they have later been found guilty of doping			1
’ if someone could outpace one of the fastest male swimmers in the world and finish three - and - a - half lengths ahead of her nearest female rival , he said , ‘ all those things , i think , legitimately call that swim into question ’			0
head and shoulders above : the teenager ( centre ) holds an unassailable lead during her gold medal winning 400 metre medley race @entity4 said her success was due to her training since she was identified as a potential champion medal winners : @entity4 shows off the gold alongside the @entity8 ' @entity169 , left , and compatriot @entity170 following the final mr @entity31 also called for an investigation into the @entity3 , saying they could be using genetic manipulation			1
‘ it is a result that demands an explanation - it is unprecedented , ’ he told the @entity175			0
genetic manipulation in animals , he said , had given added strength and oxygen usage			0
‘ who knows what it can do to humans ? ’ he added			0
questions over @entity4 's performance come after a string of @entity3 swimmers tested positive for doping in recent years			1
@entity3 won 12 of the 16 women 's titles at the 1994 world championships in @entity194 but these achievements were sullied less than a month later when seven @entity3 swimmers tested positive for banned drugs at the @entity198 in @entity199			1
at the 1998 world championships in @entity202 , four @entity3 competitors were sent home after testing positive for steroids			1
it came a week after one of their team mates and her coach were caught smuggling human growth hormone at @entity211			0
@entity3 's top backstroke swimmer and record holder @entity212 , now 29 , was given a lifetime ban after he tested positive for the same substance a month before the @entity80			1
the ban was later changed to two years			0
in 2009 , five junior @entity3 swimmers were banned for two years by the country 's swimming association after they tested positive for the anabolic agent clenbuterol - a performance - enhancing drug			1
and in june @entity3 state media said 16 - year - old @entity223 , part of the country ’s winning team at the @entity227 , had tested positive for a performance - enhancing drug , @entity228 , which boosts the body ’s oxygen supplies			1
and he said miss @entity4 ’s performance had brought ‘ back a lot of awful memories ’ of @entity236 swimmer @entity235 ’s winning performance at the @entity237 in 1996			2
@entity235 was banned for four years in 1998 for tampering with a drug test			0
as a gold medal winner , miss @entity4 will have been automatically drug - tested			1
the top four in each race are routinely tested			2
last night she continued her astonishing success by setting a new @entity36 record in the semi-finals of her best event , the 200m individual medley , with a time of 2 minutes and 8.39 seconds			1
@entity249 , @entity250 2012 ’s head of anti-doping , said that organisers had made security , cleaning , events services and others ‘ very aware of the issue of doping , so if they were to come across practices , paraphernalia , whatever it may be , then they would bring it to our attention and , of course , we would investigate this and treat it as intelligence			2
' a source close to the @entity272 swimming team , who did not want to be named , said yesterday : ' there has been a lot of talk since saturday about the @entity3 swimmers , particularly @entity4 , and how they are managing to come out of nowhere and achieve these incredible times			1
' we all know about the kind of punishing regimes the @entity3 swimmers are put through			0
’ one insight came on sunday			0
after winning silver in the 100m butterfly , @entity3 athlete @entity284 said : ‘ in @entity3 we ’re used to study , study and train , train and then rest			0
i think our way of thinking has many limits			0
in @entity295 i ’ve been invited to barbecues with my teammates - that would never happen in @entity3			0
’ officials say there have been 1,461 drug tests carried out so far in this @entity29 - no results are yet known - and that testers can take samples at any time			0
prof @entity306 , board member of @entity307 and director of sport at the @entity309 , said : ' the drug testing procedures in place at the @entity29 are extremely rigorous and the storage of samples for eight years after the @entity198 makes doping an very high risk strategy			0
' we should not be surprised by exceptional performances since @entity317 winning athletes are inevitably different to the rest of us due to their talent , training and lifestyles			0
' it 's also worth remembering that @entity3 has a vast pool of talent to choose from due to the size of its population , so we should not be too surprised when an individual with exceptional talent emerges			1
' congratulations : @entity4 hugs @entity170 after her victory at the @entity332 at the @entity333 sensation : @entity4 managed to swim the final 50m length in the race in a time of 28.93 , a time that was quicker than the men 's champion @entity16 disappointed : @entity16 shakes hand with @entity79 after they won silver in the 4x100m relay reminiscent ? @entity236 swimmer @entity235 won four medals in @entity346 in 1996 - but was later found to have contaminated drug tests in an attempt to hide drug use			1

she competes today in the 200m individual medley
@entity0 says people need to ' get real ' and that all top competitors are drug tested
