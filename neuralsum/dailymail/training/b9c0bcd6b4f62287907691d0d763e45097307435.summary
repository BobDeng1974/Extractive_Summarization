it is often joked that women drivers are less competent than men , which is , of course , wildly incorrect			0
but one unnamed woman set the fairer sex back a bit with driving that has been branded the ' worst in the world			1
' in a hilarious video shot in a parking lot in the @entity13 in @entity14 , a woman manages to turn what should have been a quick maneuver into a four minute ordeal			1
once in front of the parking space , the woman , who is fittingly dressed in bright pink , constantly turns the wheel the wrong way			2
and after struggling for close to four minutes she waves over a young man to help her out			0
she gets out and the man can be seen climbing into the driver 's seat to offer his help			2
he then manages to pull into the space in a record 40 seconds , and all is well			1
shopping : after she finishes shopping , the woman attempts to pull out of the spot , and , has a horrible time bad driver : she can be seen scraping the side of a white truck as she takes another three minutes to reverse after she finishes shopping , the woman attempts to pull out of the spot , and , once again , has a horrible time			0
she even manages to scrape the side of the white truck which is parked next to her			0
yet , showing sheer tenacity , the woman driver continues to turn the wheel the wrong way and after another three minutes of trying she finally manages to reverse out of the spot and drive away .			1
