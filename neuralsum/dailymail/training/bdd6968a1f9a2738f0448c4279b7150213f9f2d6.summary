the nation held up by the @entity1 yesterday as a shining example of how to win the war on drugs is far from the unqualified success story they make out			1
for the number of children using drugs in @entity10 has more than doubled since the country ’s laws were liberalised , the latest figures show			1
a decade after the law was relaxed , nearly a fifth of 15 and 16 - year - olds use drugs – well over twice the number in the years before decriminalisation			1
the controversial @entity20 report commissioned by the @entity1 states : ‘ it is clear that there has not been a lasting and significant increase in drug use in @entity10 since 2001			1
’ but the evidence suggests otherwise			0
injecting : a young drug user in a @entity28 slum with a needle hanging out of his arm and cigarette in hand the most recent independent report on what is happening in @entity10 shows that in 1995 eight per cent of @entity10 teenagers had tried drugs			1
in 1999 , when laws began to be relaxed , it was 12 per cent			1
but after decriminalisation in 2001 , it rose to 18 per cent in 2003 and 19 per cent in 2011			1
the picture for cannabis use is similar			2
in 1995 , only 7 per cent of @entity10 teens had tried the drug but by 2011 the figure was 16 per cent			1
the report , by the @entity47 and other drugs , looked at 100,000 15 and 16 - year - olds across @entity51			2
its most alarming finding covers children under 13 in @entity10			1
in 1999 , 2 per cent had tried cannabis			0
by 2003 , that had risen to 4 per cent and remained at that level in 2011			0
the @entity20 report based its contrary findings on evidence from the @entity61 , the @entity62 drugs watchdog , which is based in @entity63			0
but even the watchdog ’s verdict on @entity10 is contradictory			1
it has not endorsed @entity10 ’s own drug abuse figures from a 2012 survey , saying the results are not yet available			1
but it adds that the country ’s survey of children ’s health ‘ indicates an increase in the prevalence of cannabis use in the period 2006 - 10 ’			2
the @entity62 watchdog endorses @entity80 ’s verdict			0
‘ the most recent @entity80 study corroborates the findings , showing an increase in consumption of illicit substances since 2006 , ’ its report on @entity10 says			2
‘ this trend is observed among both male and female students			0
’ however the @entity20 report accepted , without qualification or reference to other sources , the @entity10 government ’s figures produced by @entity10 ’s drug control agency @entity91			2
legalised : a report has revealed that since drug laws were relaxed in @entity10 , the number of children using drugs has more than doubled with nearly a fifth of 15 and 16 - year - olds using drugs it says that among all @entity10 adults the proportion that had used cannabis in the last year was 3.3 per cent in 2001 , 3.6 per cent in 2007 and 2.7 per cent in 2012			1
on the basis of these figures , the @entity20 report said : ‘ following decriminalisation in @entity10 there has not been a lasting increase in adult drug use			2
’ there is , however , a question over the figures			0
the director of @entity91 is dr @entity117 , an influential political figure widely hailed as the architect of decriminalisation			0
he is publicly proud of the ‘ success ’ of his policy and boasted in 2012 of frequent visits by ‘ politicians , doctors , experts and journalists from around the world ’			0
critics say he has an interest in publishing figures to back his case			0
@entity134 , research fellow for the right - leaning @entity136 think tank @entity135 , said : ‘ the same man who introduced the policy is responsible for producing the figures			0
‘ dr @entity117 clearly has an interest in making the figures look good			0

@entity1 held up @entity10 as shining example on ' drugs war '
but since legalisation the number of children users has more than doubled
in 1995 8 **%** of teenagers had tried drugs but after new law it rose to 19 **%**
more children under 13 have also tried cannabis since laws were relaxed
