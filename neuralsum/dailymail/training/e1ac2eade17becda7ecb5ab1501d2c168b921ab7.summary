in broiling heat on the western tip of @entity3 , @entity0 is demanding that little bit more from his young @entity6 players			1
‘ come on , come on , come on , ’ he urges , with increasing cadence , as his elite development squad — or reserve team , in old money — play a two - touch , six - a - side game			2
‘ it ’s hot , you are tired			2
’ @entity0 ’s proteges , along with the under 18 group , coached by former @entity19 winger @entity18 , are in the quaint coastal town of @entity21 for a 10 - day training camp set against the panoramic backdrop of the @entity24			1
‘ it offers the boys a taste , but we keep them grounded			2
’ ‘ we have a motto here , ’ @entity18 begins			2
‘ great person , great footballer			1
that means punctuality , appearance , work ethic , respect			2
you speak to cleaners how you speak to the manager			2
‘ you shake hands with every member of staff in the morning and when they leave at night			2
’ at the club ’s @entity67 training ground in @entity69 , discipline is instilled in these young men			1
if they forget an item of kit , whether it be their water bottle or shin pads , they will not train			2
if they are late for a team meeting on match - day , they will not play			2
team spirit : @entity6 are looking to bring youngsters through to accord with @entity83 teamwork : the former midfielder chats to @entity86 during a training session @entity88 age : 18 , goalkeeper he has endured some injury problems but re-emerged as one of the most exciting talents			1
@entity95 - @entity94 age : 18 , defender assured as a full back , centre - half or central midfielder , he has already trained under @entity0 and played for @entity101			1
@entity102 age : 16 , defender a commanding centreback , powerful and composed in possession			2
as a 15 - year - old last season was regular in the the under 18s defence			0
@entity108 age : 17 , @entity111 winger direct and fast with a terrific left foot			0
in @entity18 has the perfect mentor as a left winger			0
@entity25 age : 19 , forward the son of @entity118 , he can operate from the wing or up front			1
was excellent in the @entity121 last season			0
‘ it is basic good manners , ’ @entity38 says , his face gleaming with pride			0
‘ socks are rolled up , shirts are tucked in			0
i have a great picture where there are two players about to come on for @entity28 at youth level			1
you can tell immediately which one is a @entity6 player			0
his shirt is tidy , his shorts are right , shinpads are correct			0
it shows they are listening			0
’ there is a conscious effort to shield these teenagers from the trappings of fame			0
while adidas are already sponsoring some of @entity6 ’s @entity30 17 - year - olds and agents have free rein to handpick the region ’s finest talent , they are also given cookery and driving awareness classes			1
city are looking to nurture players from the cradle to the gravy train of the @entity156 but in the boardroom they recognise that improvement is required			1
since the @entity161 takeover in the summer of 2008 , no player has graduated from the @entity6 academy to cement a place in the first team squad			0
last september , @entity6 defeated @entity165 with 10 overseas , outfield players			1
@entity30 players @entity167 — who signed for @entity169 on tuesday — and @entity170 started nine @entity156 matches between them since signing two years ago			1
‘ we want to bring talent through our academy into our first team , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ there are no borders in football but if there are seven or eight @entity69 boys , then fantastic			0
’ potential : @entity88 and @entity94 could be stars of the future at @entity6 youngsters : @entity6 also have high hopes for @entity108 and @entity102 upbringing : the @entity186 team encourage their men to be great people as well as great footballers certainly , the potential is there : 30 of the 46 players in @entity3 hail from the @entity194 or @entity195			1
light blue is increasingly the dominant colour in many of @entity28 ’s young dressing rooms			0
‘ we had seven under - 16s in the @entity28 squad last year , ’ @entity18 reveals			0
‘ that was a record for us			0
we have some incredibly talented @entity30 players			1
@entity108 , @entity94 , @entity88 , @entity205 , @entity102			0
the players are coming through			1
‘ below the under - 18 group , over 90 per cent of our academy is @entity30			1
recently we offered eight professional contracts and six of those are @entity30 boys			1
‘ four of those six are local boys			0
it ’s the ideal scenario but the wider you spread the net , the more chance you have of finding the gem			0
’ in charge : @entity18 on the touchline in a @entity6 under 18 fixture at @entity222 's @entity221 way back when : @entity18 , in the colours of @entity19 , takes on @entity0 ( right ) , of @entity224 , in a @entity156 match during the 1998 - 1999 season the seeds of talent are beginning to germinate			1
last season , @entity6 ’s @entity229 were national champions and the under 18 side were northern league winners			0
under @entity0 , an under 19 side reached the quarter - final of the @entity236			1
a 6 - 0 victory over @entity238 reverberated around @entity239 , with five @entity30 names on the team sheet			1
most are yet to be seen in the first team squad , something @entity0 attributes to the ‘ massive ’ gap between youth competitions and the demands of elite football			1
it is why @entity6 are thought to remain receptive to discussions over b - teams in the lower tiers			0
as the authorities prevaricate , @entity6 are single - minded in their aspiration and little encapsulates the journey from chip - fat to caviar quite like the money and dedication flowing into this academy			0
time and effort : @entity0 insists he can shape stars of the future having invested heavily in the first team , securing two @entity156 titles in three years , sheik @entity262 is now hard at work on @entity6 ’s foundations			1
later this year , the £ 150m @entity267 will open , a stone ’s throw from the @entity270 , where @entity271 once intended to build a @entity272			0
it will boast facilities unrivalled in the @entity30 game and @entity276 , a club kit man for more than 20 years , reflects : ‘ we used to train on council pitches and do pre-season at a school between @entity281 and @entity282			1
’ on this summer morning , it is a breathless training session in sticky , cloying conditions and @entity0 has become irritated , noticing that his players have become attracted to the ball			1
‘ stop , stop , ’ he orders , his players freezing instantly			2
ten of you , all bunched together ! how can you play like this ? look for the space , make the pitch bigger			2
’ he motions , spreading out his hands			0
‘ the boys need to understand this , ’ @entity0 insists			1
‘ when you have the ball , the pitch must be as big as possible			0
if you lose it , make it as tight as possible and then seven seconds , maximum , to win it back			2
foreign imports : @entity303 's first team has been almost impossible to break into in recent years star : @entity305 is one of many big - money moves @entity6 have made ‘ the best teams have a quick recovery			0
when you press , it is the whole team , high and fast , even the goalkeeper			0
watch @entity311 — unbelievable , he is like an old no 5			1
but he was n’t born this way , he trained hard			0
if we start early , we can create these players			2
’ this , in a nutshell , is the club ’s philosophy : an intoxicating brand of high - tempo , passing football that has been outlined by @entity38 , sporting director @entity319 and academy director @entity320			2
it is the identity that @entity6 now encourage at all levels , from the under - 11 group to the first team under @entity303			0
@entity38 expands : ‘ when i took the job four years ago i outlined a 10 - year plan to really start to see a group of talent coming through together all playing the @entity6 way			0
in the late 90s it was @entity332 , then @entity333 , now @entity334			1
’ ‘ the numbers will not lie , ’ @entity0 concedes , puffing out his cheeks			1
‘ we have to make a report in 10 years on how many players are in the first team			1
then we can say we did it right or we did it wrong			0
’ @entity345 @entity344 v @entity6 highlights			0

city trying to bring through @entity30 players for the future
@entity0 looks to *replicate* @entity334 model , creating stars such as @entity311
@entity25 one of those highly rated at the club
city look to make great people , as well as great players
