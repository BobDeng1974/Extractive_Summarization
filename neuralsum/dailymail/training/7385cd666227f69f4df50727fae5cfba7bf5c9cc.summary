the geese return to exactly the same spot - @entity9 's in @entity10 , @entity11 - every year to lay their eggs in a corner near the petrol station			1
it is thought they choose the spot because it is near where a pond used to be in the corner of the car park			1
the feathered family are now treated as vip guests by staff , who have become rather fond of the local celebrities			1
home sweet home : @entity27 waddle along in the car park of @entity9 's in @entity10 , the unlikely surroundings they call home i 'll sit here : the geese are most often seen first thing in the morning , and it is thought they were attracted to the site because a pond used to be on the same industrial estate location : this map shows where the geese return to each year , they are thought to like the site because the @entity9 's car park and petrol station are near to where the pond used to be on the upper left they now cordon off the area when they arrive so the birds can nest undisturbed			1
