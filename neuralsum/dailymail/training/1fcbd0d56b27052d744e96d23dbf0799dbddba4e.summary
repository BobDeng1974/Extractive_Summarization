by @entity0 published : 12:52 est , 11 january 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 12 january 2013 @entity2 astronomers have found the biggest structure in the universe - so large that it would take a spacecraft travelling at the speed of light 4 billion years to cross it			1
the large quasar group ( @entity8 ) is made up of quasars , galaxies from the early days of the universe			1
this particular group is so large that it challenges modern cosmological theory , researchers said			1
whole clusters of galaxies can be 6 - 10 million light years across but @entity31 can be 650 million light years or more across			2
dr @entity33 ’ discovery has a typical dimension of 1.6 billion light years			0
but because it is elongated , its longest dimension is 4 billion light years - that is some 1,650 times larger than the distance from the @entity26 to @entity28			0
dr @entity40 from @entity42 ’s @entity41 led the study			0
' while it is difficult to fathom the scale of this @entity8 , we can say quite definitely it is the largest structure ever seen in the entire universe , ' he said			1
' this is hugely exciting – not least because it runs counter to our current understanding of the universe			2
' the universe does n't seem to be as uniform as we thought			2
' since 1982 it has been know that quasars tend to group together in clumps or ‘ structures ’ of surprisingly large sizes , forming large quasar groups or @entity8 - but researchers have not seen one on this scale before			1
' travelling at the speed of light , it would still take 4 billion light years to cross , ' he said			0
' this is significant not just because of its size but also because it challenges the @entity69 , which has been widely accepted since @entity70			2
the @entity72 distribution of the 73 quasars that make up the new giant structure ' our team has been looking at similar cases which add further weight to this challenge and we will be continuing to investigate these fascinating phenomena			1
' the modern theory of cosmology is based on the work of @entity70 , and depends on the assumption of the @entity69			1
the principle is assumed but has never been demonstrated observationally ‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’			0
to give some sense of scale , our galaxy , the @entity26 , is separated from its nearest neighbour , the @entity28 , by about 2.5 million light - years			0
whole clusters of galaxies can be 6 - 10 million light years across but @entity31 can be 650 million light years or more across			0
although , based on the @entity69 and the modern theory of cosmology , calculations suggest that astrophysicists should not be able to find a structure larger than 1.2 billion light years			1
our galaxy , the @entity26 , is separated from its nearest neighbour , the @entity28 , by about 2.5 million light - years - but the new structure measure 4 billion light years however , @entity33 ’ discovery has a typical dimension of 1.6 billion light years			0
but because it is elongated , its longest dimension is 4 billion light years - that is some 1,650 times larger than the distance from the @entity26 to @entity28 .			0
