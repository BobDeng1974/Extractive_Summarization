by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 26 july 2013 the heart has long been a symbol of love , devotion and sensuality but advanced medical techniques are now turning the organ into a thing of beauty			2
these stunning images show this year ’s winners of the @entity12 ’s @entity14 science image competition			1
using medical devices such as mri scans and microscopes , medical experts have captured the heart in a totally new light , highlighting its complexity and mystery			2
the overall winners of the @entity12 competition were dr @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 of the @entity28 , whose ' @entity29 ' won @entity30			1
the image reveals the remarkable 3d structure of an adult mouse heart the overall winners were dr @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 of the @entity28 , whose ' @entity29 ' won @entity30			1
their image reveals the remarkable 3d structure of an adult mouse heart			1
the picture was taken using a new technique called optical projection tomography ( @entity41 ) which is being developed to enable experts to better measure the extent of injury after a heart attack and to assess repair			2
dr @entity47 of the @entity48 won the @entity49 with her image entitled ' @entity51 '			2
the picture depicts the front view of a developing two - day - old zebrafish heart			1
scientists study the creatures because of their remarkable ability to repair their own hearts after damage - an ability which we currently lack			2
the green cells are heart muscle cells , and the red and blue staining shows components that make up the muscle			1
the early heart tube has started to loop			0
' @entity51 ' ( left ) shows the front view of a two - day - old zebrafish heart			1
the green cells are heart muscle cells , and the red and blue staining shows components that make up the muscle			1
' what sets your heart on @entity74 ' ( right ) shows an mri of the heart of a healthy kidney donor ' at the @entity80 of it ' , by @entity78 from @entity79 , shows white blood cells in the heart sensing invading microbes and kick starting the immune response it consists of two sections – the large , thin atrium ( where blood flows in ) and the smaller , thicker ventricle ( where blood leaves the heart )			0
dr @entity93 of @entity94 was highly commended for ' at the heart of a cell '			2
it shows a heart - shaped image of a nucleus from a single vascular smooth muscle cell			1
vascular smooth muscle helps give blood vessels their shape			0
the green specks show multiple regions of dna damage , which could explain the unusual shape			0
@entity112 , by @entity109 and @entity110 at @entity111 , illustrates the simulated motion of a two - headed fragment of myosin , an essential molecule found in heart muscle dr @entity118 from the @entity119 was also commended for his image ' what sets your @entity122 ? ' it shows an mri of the heart of a healthy kidney donor			1
the @entity128 technique is sensitive enough to detect early scar formation and a scan can pick up if there are any changes in the heart after donating a kidney , which could potentially be treated with medication			2
dr @entity136 and dr @entity137 from the @entity138 took ' @entity139 ' which was also highly commended			0
it shows immune cells – called foam cells – which are present in the arteries of people with atherosclerosis ( stiffening and hardening of the arteries )			0
' @entity148 to @entity149 ' by @entity150 at the @entity151 uses a scanning - electron microscope to capture an image that shows the stress response of a blood vessel cell under conditions like diabetes dr @entity136 and dr @entity137 from the @entity138 took ' @entity139 ' which shows immune cells ¿ called foam cells ¿ which are present in arteries of people with atherosclerosis ( stiffening and hardening of the arteries ) the white specks show cholesterol is captured within the foam cells			1
this cholesterol can be altered by the cells to produce damaging effects which can lead to heart attacks and strokes			0
other entrants in the competition included ' @entity173 ' by @entity174 and dr @entity175 from @entity176			0
this microscope image shows cells which line blood vessels and reveals the proteins that provide support and shape to the cell			1
these are elongated actin stress fibres ( shown in green ) and the tangled web of microtubules ( shown in red )			0
' @entity188 ' by @entity189 and @entity190 , of the @entity48 highlights how the heart is not exclusively made up of beating cells			0
in fact , the majority of cells are cardiac fibroblasts which do not initiate movement at all ' at the @entity80 of it ' , by @entity78 from @entity79 , shows white blood cells in the heart sensing invading microbes and kick starting the immune response			0
this image shows white blood cells with receptors ( pink ) migrating from a small vein ( turquoise ) in response to bacteria			0
' @entity148 to @entity149 ' by @entity150 at the @entity151 uses a scanning - electron microscope to capture an image that shows the stress response of a blood vessel cell under conditions like diabetes			1
understanding the stresses that diabetes places on the cardiovascular system , and the changes in cellular structure and behaviour , may help researchers cure the complications of diabetes			0
' @entity173 ' is a microscope image that shows cells which line blood vessels and reveals the proteins that provide support and shape to the cell			1
these are elongated actin stress fibres ( shown in green ) and the tangled web of microtubules ( shown in red ) ' at the @entity80 ' shows a heart - shaped image of a nucleus from a single vascular smooth muscle cell			1

finally @entity112 , by @entity109 and @entity110 at @entity94 , illustrates the simulated motion of a two - headed fragment of myosin , an essential molecule found in heart muscle			1
different time frames of this dragonfly - shaped molecule are simultaneously shown , with red spikes indicating the direction of motion .			2
