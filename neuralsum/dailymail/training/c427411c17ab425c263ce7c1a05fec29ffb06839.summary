defending champion @entity0 has pulled out of the @entity1 after failing to recover from a wrist injury			2
@entity0 was in a race to be fit for the final @entity4 of the year , which begins on august 25 , after injuring his right wrist during a training session in @entity7 last month			2
and the @entity8 has had to admit defeat , which is good news for @entity10 who will now be moved up one place in the seedings to no 8			0
out : defending champion @entity0 will not be playing at the @entity1 this year because of injury it means the @entity16 will face an easier draw at @entity18 should he make the last 16 , facing an opponent seeded between no 9 and 12			1
in an announcement on monday afternoon , @entity0 said : ' i am very sorry to announce i wo n't be able to play at this year 's @entity1 , a tournament on which i 've played three consecutive finals in my last participations			2
@entity24 forces @entity0 out of year 's final grand slam doubling up : @entity0 won the @entity1 for the second time last year - the first coming in 2010 @entity10 's potential last - 16 opponents : no 9 seed - @entity28 ( @entity29 ) no 10 - @entity30 ( @entity31 ) no 11 - @entity32 ( @entity33 ) no 12 - @entity34 ( @entity29 ) ' i am sure you understand that it is a very tough moment for me since it is a tournament i love and where i have great memories from fans , the night matches , so many things			1
' not much more i can do right now , other than accept the situation and , as always in my case , work hard in order to be able to compete at the highest level once i am back			0
' as a result , @entity47 is bumped up to the no 2 seed which is a boost to the 33 - year - old 's hopes of winning his first @entity4 since @entity53			0
if @entity47 - who won his first @entity55 title for two years in @entity56 on sunday - was to win the tournament , he would move above rival @entity0 in the rankings to no 2			0
@entity60 : @entity0 beat @entity61 in the final at @entity18 last year it has not been the best of years for 14 - time @entity4 champion @entity0 , whose last match was a shock last - 16 defeat to 19 - year - old @entity70 @entity69 at the start of july			1
@entity0 , 28 , did win the @entity72 in june for a ninth time but struggled during the early part of the clay - court season and suffered a back problem during his defeat in the @entity79 final to @entity80			0
sidelined : @entity0 's last outing was at @entity82 earlier this summer ... sent packing : @entity0 crashed to a shock defeat at the hands of little - known @entity69 at @entity85			1
