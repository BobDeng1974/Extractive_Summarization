by @entity0 @entity1 , 14 , has been found to be suffering from polymorphic seizure disorder for 12 years			1
she is pictured with her mother doctors have decoded a teenage girl 's genetic make up to help reveal what is causing the violent seizures her parents fear could prove fatal			1
@entity1 , 14 , began suffering epileptic fits when she was two years old			1
for more than a decade doctors have tried to diagnose the teenager 's condition to help find a treatment			2
specialists now believe they have had a breakthrough , after analysing @entity1 's parents ' genes			1
by examining their dna , experts discovered @entity1 suffers a mutation of the @entity22 gene			1
the condition , which is thought to affect less than 100 children in the @entity25 , means sodium channels in the brain are broken and electric impulses are unable to travel down the nerves , causing epileptic fits			1
her family hope the discovery could pave the way for a treatment that could change her life			0
ms @entity1 ’s mother , @entity36 , 45 , a self - employed businesswoman from @entity37 , said : ‘ up until the age of two - and - a - half she had no seizures but then she had severe convulsions			1
‘ a week later they were just coming faster and stronger and that ’s when we went to hospital			0
‘ dr @entity45 started working on @entity1 ’s case and for the past 11 years he ’s been helping us			2
the neurologist works at @entity49 ’s @entity48			0
mrs @entity1 said : ‘ we ’ve been through various medications and the seizures have been quite bad in the past			2
' there have been nasty seizures where she ’s crashed to the ground and had stitches and lost teeth			1
‘ we are in the earliest stages of the diagnosis but we ’re so grateful for the work of dr @entity45 and his team			0
’ doctors have analysed the genes of @entity1 's ( pictured ) parents to find that she suffers from a genetic mutation of the @entity22 gene ms @entity1 , from @entity68 in @entity69 , needs round - the - clock care and has problems with communications after also being diagnosed with pervasive development delay			1
her family , including her father @entity75 , 49 and her brother @entity76 , 16 , live in fear @entity1 's condition could prove fatal			1
' you live knowing @entity1 could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last ' - @entity82 , @entity1 's mother ‘ it ’s terrifying when @entity1 has a fit and it always will be - you live knowing @entity1 could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last			1
there ’s always that fear but that ’s the role of a parent , ’ mrs @entity1 said			2
‘ we ’ve got incredible support and genetic tests have been coming along for some time			0
‘ these medics are working with so many people they are able to change people ’s lives			0
they are fabulous neurologists , we could n’t be in better hands			0
‘ we are so grateful , our family , and our external family			0
we can work anywhere in the country but we could n’t get the same support we get here in @entity49			0
' @entity1 is an absolute star			2
i ’ve never met such a resilient child who bounces back from everything - this last year she ’s been so happy as an individual			0
’ @entity1 's mother @entity36 said : ‘ it ’s terrifying when @entity1 has a fit and it always will be - you live knowing @entity1 could have an epileptic fit and fall and that would be her last			1
there ’s always that fear but that ’s the role of a parent			0
' they are both pictured left and right people diagnosed with the disorder have severe epileptic fits and seizures			1
patients typically suffer fits before their first birthday			0
seizures often occur in clusters for prolonged periods of time and children often have learning difficulties			0
the condition is thought to affect less than 100 children in the @entity25			1
polymorphic seizure disorder is cause by broken sodium channels in the brain that mean electric impulses are unable to travel down the nerves - causing fits			1
scientists have now found that @entity1 has a genetic mutation of the @entity22 gene			1
there is currently no medicine to effectively treat or control the condition			0
dr @entity45 is trying to raise funds that could help unlock the science behind childhood brain diseases including meningitis , epilepsy and mitochondrial diseases			0
some of the illnesses encountered by @entity156 and his team are so rare they have not yet been medically identified			0
he warned that there is a still a ‘ great distance ’ between diagnosing ms @entity1 ’s condition and developing the correct medication			2
he said : ‘ we ’ve known for many years that @entity1 clearly has learning problems and bad epilepsy and this is an example of how medical science in this area has been moving forward			2
‘ we are understanding more and more about epilepsy in children			0
' @entity1 ’s epilepsy is an example of the kind of condition that we in the medical community had not really identified but we are now recognising and finding more often			2

@entity1 , 14 , began having epileptic fits when she was two years old
she was found to be suffering from polymorphic seizure disorder
specialists analysed her parent 's genes discovering that @entity1 has a mutation of the @entity22 gene
the condition is thought to affect less than 100 children in the @entity25
some of @entity1 's seizures have been so violent that she has fallen to the ground and lost teeth or needed stitches for *injuries*
it is hoped the discovery could one day lead to new treatments
