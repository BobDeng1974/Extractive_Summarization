it was the first time the tiny country 's tightly guarded capital had been targeted			0
vigorous campaign : there have been at least 34 self - immolations in the last year to highlight @entity8 's restrictions on @entity84 and to call for the return from exile of the @entity4 spiritual leader , the @entity87 ( pictured ) @entity8 authorities identified the dead man as 19 - year - old @entity90 and the other man as @entity92 , while @entity94 sources claim the two men were both waiters at a nearby restaurant			1
there have been at least 34 such protests since march of last year to draw attention to @entity8 's restrictions on @entity84 and to call for the return from exile of the @entity4 spiritual leader , the @entity87			1
most have taken place in heavily @entity4 areas of @entity8 , but only one had occurred in @entity46 itself and none in the capital			2
protests have become rare in remote @entity46 and @entity54 in particular because of tight police security that has blanketed the area since anti-government riots erupted in @entity54 in 2008			0
@entity109 reported on monday that @entity54 was under heavy police and paramilitary guard following the immolations and that the situation was very tense			0
@entity8 's official news agency @entity114 blamed the protests on separatists and said the incidents were handled quickly and order restored			0
