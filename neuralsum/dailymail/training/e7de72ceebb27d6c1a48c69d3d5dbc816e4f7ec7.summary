when she found herself suffering from anxiety attacks brought on by the menopause , @entity0 was relieved to learn they could be treated			1
she was rather less happy , however , when her insurer refused to pay – on the grounds that menopause - related ailments are considered ‘ natural ’			1
now the presenter , 52 , has accused @entity8 of ageism and sexism after it declined to fund her treatment despite the fact she forks out £ 400 a month to cover her family against medical problems			1
miss @entity0 , who also suffers from insomnia , said she can not turn to the @entity16 as it does not offer the combination of treatments she requires – leaving her ‘ caught between a rock and a hard place ’			1
@entity0 , 52 , suffers from anxiety attacks due to the menopause			1
while there is medication available to help , she has been told her health insurer wo n't cover ' anything to do with the menopause ' speaking to a gathering of advertising experts , she said : ‘ i am going to tell you something very intimate			1
‘ like a lot of people my age , i had been suffering from sleeplessness and strange anxiety about things like the @entity38 shopping list – stuff that really does n’t matter in the great scheme of things			2
i wake at 2am and think : “ did i put carrots on the list ? ” ’ miss @entity0 , who presents @entity44 ’s @entity45 and is an editor of @entity47 for older people , said her gp recommended she see a ‘ brilliant gynaecologist ’ specialising in the menopause			1
but before having an appointment , she had to ask @entity8 for ‘ pre-authorisation ’ to make sure it would pay for the treatment			1
she said : ‘ the girl who answered the phone went away , came back around three minutes later and said “ has anyone mentioned early menopause to you ? ” ' i said , “ no one ’s mentioned early menopause , but they have mentioned menopause , and it is something we ’re looking into			2
hence the reason i need the pre-authorisation for this appointment ”			0
‘ and she said , “ sorry , we do n’t cover anything to do with the menopause ”			2
’ the presenter claimed she was told this is because the menopause is ‘ natural ’			1
but she said she could not find the clause in the small - print of her insurance booklet			0
‘ i would say the majority of ailments are natural , ’ she said			2
‘ there are so many side effects of menopause , and it affects different women differently , so the insurers can use this as a blanket ban			2
’ miss @entity0 requires a personally tailored combination of adrenal stimulants , sleep and anxiety medications , and diet supplements administered by a specialist – which is not available on the @entity16			1
miss @entity0 says she was told by the call handler at @entity8 that because the menopause is ' natural ' the company will not cover any treatments ( image posed by model ) she added : ‘ the @entity16 solution is hormone replacement therapy patches , which is a blunt mallet , so women are stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place			1
‘ the woman on the phone agreed it would be better if my symptoms were a mental health issue as they could cover that			0
clearly madness is more palatable to them than menopause			0
‘ i have had a health insurance policy for 32 years			0
to discover that at the point when , for the first time in your life , you may want a little bit of help with your medical situation they point blank refuse is extraordinary			0
‘ for me , it was a moment of clarification in terms of ageism in society , in terms of attitudes to women in society , in terms of attitudes of companies to women			0
' they think we are so powerless we ca n’t respond to a situation like that			0
’ miss @entity0 was speaking at the launch of new research by communications agency @entity140			1
it found 65 per cent of over- 50s felt ignored by the fashion industry			0
she criticised the use of younger fashion models , saying it had made her daughter @entity147 , ten , insecure about her body			0
‘ we live in a world where everything is soft focus – make everyone look beautiful , make them look like they ’re 12 years old , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s bad for everybody			0
’ an @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ we have started an investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further until we have completed it			2
