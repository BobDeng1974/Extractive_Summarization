mr @entity6 has written to @entity21 and @entity22 to complain about @entity0 ’s request to install air conditioning units at the bottom of his garden , which backs onto mr @entity6 ’s property			1
the great - great grandson of mr @entity29 is worried the machines ’ noise will detract from his quality of life			0
he wrote that the three units together will produce a constant sound of @entity36 , ‘ which is nearly the same comparison as an adult speaking ’			0
he added : ‘ my garden is only 90 sqm and from the location of the units to my kitchen doors is 9.5 metres so why should i have someone else ’s noise affecting my surrounding property , where the applicant in question can put the condenser units anywhere the applicant wishes on his property as it is vastly bigger			2
‘ if the resident would like to install the condenser units , i would grant the applicant permission to install them but nowhere near my property so it does n’t affect my family from going outside , enjoying the garden from some tranquillity and freedom from disturbance			2
’ he is also worried about the disturbance that might be caused to local residents if the proposed works on the nineteenth century property are given the green light			0

he lives in the property with his wife @entity73 , 35 , and their two children however , mr @entity2 , who has lived in the @entity83 for four decades , quickly submitting an objection to the assorted proposals , which included building a recording studio , partly filling a swimming pool and adding a window overlooking his garden			2
in a letter to the council , the veteran rocker wrote that he was ‘ extremely concerned ’ the works would create an eyesore and might even damage his own @entity96 i listed property			0
he added : ‘ i have been responsible for the protection of the @entity100 for over 40 years and i am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the wellbeing of this important heritage asset			0
