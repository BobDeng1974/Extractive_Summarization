when @entity1 launched her latest magazine covers on an unsuspecting world this morning she had one wish , to break the internet			2
we ’d reason that she ’s not far off			2
not only have the two images of her taken for @entity9 gone completely viral , one of them had over half a million @entity12 likes in just nine hours			1
the image was instantly compared to the iconic @entity15 cover , and memes of her bum and lists written of things her bum looks like soon followed			1
the pictures were shot by famous photographer @entity29 - @entity28 who can forget her # belfie ? @entity1 sparked a huge amount of copycat posts when she instagrammed a picture of her post baby body in a white swimsuit @entity1 's pictures have been compared to this famous @entity15 cover which was also shot by @entity39 proud husband @entity40 shared the magazine covers with a simple caption even @entity1 's husband @entity40 could n't resist sharing the new pictures of his wife , posting them to @entity46 with the simple caption ' @entity47 '			2
indeed , if this reaction is anything to go by it ’s safe to say we ’re all pretty bottom crazy			2
but @entity1 's is n't the only behind we 're obsessed with			2
ever since the nineties there has been explosion of love for shapely bottoms			1
from @entity59 ’s extremely pert glutes in @entity61 gold hotpants in the ‘ spinning around ’ video to @entity64 ’s most famous ass - et we just ca n’t get enough			2
such big business are these bums that @entity1 is rumoured to have insured hers for £ 13million			1
although that does n’t mean she knows what all the fuss is about			0
she once said , ‘ i do n’t get the fact , like , why it ’s talked about			0
i do n’t get it			0
sometimes i get bored of talking about it … most women have one			1
’ who could forget those gold hot - pants ? @entity59 set pulses racing in her spinning around video @entity64 places a friendly hand on @entity82 's famous bottom , earlier this year they recorded a song together called ' @entity85 ' all about big bums look at her butt ! @entity88 released @entity89 earlier this year , in the very raunchy video she showed off her large bottom @entity1 regularly wears tight clothes and dresses which show off her curvaceous bottom when @entity96 was bridesmaid for her sister @entity97 all anyone could talk about was her bottom and when @entity96 played bridesmaid to her sister @entity97 in 2012 , her bum was nearly more talked about than the royal wedding itself			1
at the time @entity103 reported that they had seen a massive surge in shaping underwear with women seeking enhance their bottoms			1
stars such as @entity64 , @entity88 and @entity82 are all also known for showing off there buttocks			1
and people like @entity112 are n't afraid to admit they put the hard work in , ‘ i guess my butt is natural			0
but i go through stages like every woman			0
i like being curvy but sometimes i get curvy in the wrong places , ' she once said			0
‘ after new year i do stairs - they are the best thing for butt cheeks			0
every january i 'll start working out			0
i 'll do that for three months and then stop again ! ’ according to the history books our obsession with all things derriere was going on long before @entity1 and her perfectly rounded , perfectly oiled posterior showed up			0
in fact it dates all the way back to @entity130 when statues such as the @entity132 were created with large shapely bottoms and thick thighs			1
it is thought the fascination stems from our inbuilt need to procreate ; a rounder bottom indicates a wider pelvic area which is recognised as a sign of good fertility			0
although we ’re not sure that anyone looking at @entity1 ’s bottom today is thinking about how big her pelvis is … the @entity132 is a prime example of how early the obsession with buns began as it dates back to around @entity130 the @entity148 which stands in the @entity149 , @entity147 is famous because it shows its subject revealing her ' beautiful buttocks ' from then on images of the buttocks could be seen and revered throughout history			1
the @entity148 , which literally translates to , ‘ @entity156 of the beautiful buttocks , ’ is thought to be of @entity158 origin , created in the 1st of 2nd century @entity160 it depicts a woman lifting her gown to show off her shapely bottom , furthermore @entity165 is said to have one of the most recognisable bums in the world			1
@entity170 's , ‘ @entity169 , ’ or ‘ @entity171 shows a woman reclining on a bed with her bottom clearly on show @entity176 created a series of paintings which shows naked dancers drying and preening themselves after they had bathed similarly @entity181 painters throughout the ages have focused their work on bottoms			1
@entity170 painted , ‘ @entity169 , ’ or ‘ @entity171 , ’ in 1745 showing a woman reclining on a bed with a sheet only covering the top part of her body			1
in around 1895 @entity176 similarly focused on the bottom in a series of paintings of dancers drying themselves off after bathing including one called , ' after the bath , woman drying herself			0
' in all of the pictures the artist focused on the back of the women rather than the front			2
@entity202 was famed for her curvy body which she loved to show off in a variety of swimming costumes the popularity of the bottom went on throughout the 20th century with film stars such as @entity202 and @entity209 setting hearts racing with their curvy figures			0
then in the 1970 ’s the @entity213 poster which showed a young woman on a tennis court lifting up her skirt to reveal her bottom to the camera sold a massive two million copies			0
the photograph starred @entity222 , who was 18 at the time , the picture had been taken by her then boyfriend @entity223 who had sold the photo to the poster company .			0

images of buttocks have been popular since @entity229
@entity181 artists liked to paint women in the nude showing off their bottoms
there have even been songs written about the love of big butts
