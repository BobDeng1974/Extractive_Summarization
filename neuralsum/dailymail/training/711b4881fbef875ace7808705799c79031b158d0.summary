by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:11 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 01:49 est , 1 august 2013 top lawyers last night greeted demands to explain their links to controversial private detectives with a wall of silence			1
dozens of @entity11 ’s biggest law firms refused to say if they employ snoopers or what steps they take to ensure that the private eyes obey the law			1
industry insiders claim the use of detective agencies is commonplace in complex fraud , insurance and divorce cases			1
but the @entity22 found a reluctance by more than 30 legal firms to discuss the issue or account for their actions			1
private eyes : mystery surrounds the use of snoopers by legal firms , and few are answering questions among those who failed to comment were some of the most profitable companies , including @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
other high - profile international firms such as @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 also failed to respond			2
of the handful of firms that did reply , most confirmed that they used private investigators when ‘ it is in our clients ’ interests to do so ’			1
one insisted ‘ we expect that they operate fully within the parameters of the law ’ , with no evidence of how this would work in practice			1
the wall of silence came as police were urged to name those on a secret list of 102 firms and individuals who employed rogue detective agencies that broke the law by hacking , blagging and stealing sensitive personal information to order , in what has become known as the ‘ blue chip ’ hacking scandal			1
nothing but weasel words the largest group of clients is made up of law firms , and mps are angry that they and others have escaped scrutiny			1
critics called for an end to ‘ double standards ’ and for ‘ arms - length involvement ’ in criminal acts to be investigated rigorously			2
they pointed out that law firms and others escaped police investigation while those accused of phone hacking were the subject of an open - ended multi-million pound inquiry			1
as the government finally announced that it will regulate private investigators , the @entity98 said it would haul back officials to explain the continued secrecy			2
@entity103 : wants to name names committee chairman @entity103 said he remained determined to publish the names of those involved and will confront the @entity108 ( @entity108 ) again in september			0
the agency , which will be replaced by the @entity110 in october , has been accused of protecting those named in its intelligence report on private eyes			1
mr @entity103 said he could name names using parliamentary privilege , but did not want to prejudice potential criminal inquiries			0
he said @entity82 should not be part of a ‘ secret squirrel club ’ in which information in the public interest can not be published			0
asked if @entity108 could keep ‘ stringing along ’ the committee , he added : ‘ that is the balance			0
this list has been around for a number of years and nobody has done anything about it			0
this can be cleared up quite quickly			0
you should ask the firms involved – did they know that the rogue investigators were getting illegal information , were they acting illegally ? ’ ‘ if yes , then you have to consider criminal liability			2
if no , then you cross them off			0
these companies , individuals and firms do n’t even know they are on this list			2
’ the committee is writing to the top 100 legal firms and every @entity142 company to ask if they used private investigators			1
private investigators will need a licence to operate or face jail , home secretary @entity144 announced yesterday			2
before receiving a licence , they will have to pass a qualification and undergo background checks under rules being brought in from september 2014			0
operating without a licence will be a criminal offence carrying a six - month jail term and a £ 5,000 fine			0
crucially , legitimate journalist investigations will not be covered			0
@entity157 mp @entity156 , a senior member of the committee , said : ‘ now we ’ve been told that the government is going to regulate , it looks as if this will require an @entity162			0
‘ if @entity163 is going to debate this issue we need the maximum possible information			0
’ the @entity22 contacted the top 20 @entity11 law firms by gross earnings , as well as more than a dozen other high - profile companies to ask if they used private investigators			1
the vast majority did not respond at all to inquiries by telephone and email , despite being given more than 48 hours to do so			0
@entity39 , a sprawling global firm , said it was ‘ not able to say anything ’ , while @entity40 said it did not want to prejudice any response to mps			0
a spokesman for major firm @entity180 defended its use of private investigators			2
@entity183 , which employs more than 4,000 lawyers in 30 countries , said it employed private eyes ‘ when it is in our clients ’ interests ’			1
other firms said they could not reply because they employed so many staff in different offices that it was impossible to know what they are all doing			2
crackdown : home secretary @entity144 unveiled plans to force private investigators to obtain licences to operate , or face fines or even jail deputy prime minister @entity200 said he had a ‘ lot of sympathy ’ with mps who believed those who used snoopers should be named			1
he added that if ‘ big companies and organisations ’ were using investigators they ‘ should be open about it ’			0
@entity210 , director of the @entity211 , said : ‘ these rogue investigators should be investigated fully – and arms - length involvement by companies in their crimes should be uncovered			0

@entity22 reveals reluctance of law firms to discuss use of private eyes
others admit to it but say they ' expect ' them to not break the law
