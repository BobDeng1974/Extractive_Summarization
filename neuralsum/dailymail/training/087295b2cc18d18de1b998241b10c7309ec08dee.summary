published : 12:15 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 03:28 est , 31 august 2012 a controversial @entity1 website that allows people who need a kidney to plead directly for a donor online is launching in the @entity5			1
the @entity6 runs an anonymous scheme so that altruistic donors are not informed who ends up getting their kidney			1
it is given to the person who is judged by a medical panel to most need it and who will benefit most from it			0
however , under the @entity1 scheme users who sign up to the website @entity18 can watch personal appeals and read about their background before deciding who they would like to donate to			1
one person makes an appeal via the @entity18 website many needy recipients upload videos of themselves perhaps playing the guitar , while others feature their children asking viewers to help make their parents better			1
potential donors can also get in touch with the patient via a messaging service			1
once a person decides they would like to donate their kidney they can check to see if they are a blood type match before their suitability is tested further			0
the website , based in @entity45 , has successfully matched around 250 strangers , which is twice as many as the @entity6 has managed			1
@entity47 , from @entity18 told @entity48 : ' we have wanted to come to @entity50 for the longest time			0
we have the ability to take our system to the @entity5 and save their lives			1
' @entity55 from @entity56 has signed up to @entity18 because she wants a more personal system			2
' i like knowing who i am going to give my kidney to , ' she told @entity48			0
' you do n't get that in the @entity5			1
you just go to the hospital and they expect you to give it up just like that			0
' the website has been criticised by doctors who say organ donations should not be decided on the basis of who can tell the ' saddest story			2
' mother - of - three @entity73 has become the first person in the @entity5 to sign up as a patient on the @entity18 website the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , the @entity5 ’s transplant watchdog , carried out a review which found the website could charge up to 595 @entity1 dollars ( £ 376.77 ) for patients to sign up			1
however , it is made clear on the website that it is illegal to offer or receive payment for the organ			2
@entity87 , director of strategy and quality at the @entity77 said : ' we are not yet clear how it will operate here and the legal implications , and we have not had a conversation with the charity about these issues			1
once we have more information , we can advise members of the public considering the possibility of arranging a donation through this route			0
' we are acutely aware that organ donation can be an emotive and sensitive subject			0
it is our role to make sure that living organ donors give consent to the process , and to safeguard against reward being offered or sought for a donation			2
' the principle of organ donations , both from living and deceased people , being a freely given gift is the basis of the law in this area			0
we must give careful consideration to new developments to make sure that they are within these parameters			0
' we have seen an increase in the use of social networking websites which can put potential donors in contact with people who need an organ transplant			1
we are constantly reviewing our approach to keep pace with such developments , to make sure they meet the legal requirements			2
' the @entity77 said they would launch a new framework for the assessment of directed - altruistic donations on september 10			2
patient @entity73 who needs a kidney has become the first to sign up in the @entity5			1
the mother - of - three says she is a qualified teacher and would love to return to her job one day			2
' i need a new kidney very badly			0
my kidneys were destroyed through no fault of my own , ' she said in her post			0
however , she says she is not yet on dialysis and is currently controlling her condition with medication			0
it is therefore unlikely that mrs @entity73 would be viewed as a ' priority ' on the @entity6 transplant list .			0

potential donors can watch heart - felt appeals from patients on the website
the @entity5 ’s transplant watchdog say they were not sure what the legal implications of the new system would be
