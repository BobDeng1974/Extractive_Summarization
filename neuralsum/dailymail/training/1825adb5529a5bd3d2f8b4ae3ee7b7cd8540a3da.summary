a senior @entity1 commander who has advised the prime minister has warned that withdrawing @entity4 troops from @entity1 will spark a ‘ global jihad ’			1
the damaging comments come on the day @entity7 hosts a high - profile summit at @entity9 to discuss plans to combat the @entity11 and other terrorist threats after @entity14 and @entity4 troops pull out next year			1
but in an exclusive interview with @entity18 , colonel @entity15 of the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) said that removing @entity4 forces from @entity1 will allow @entity20 and the @entity11 to seize power			1
combat zone : col @entity15 , second left , with @entity7 and chief of defence staff general sir @entity23 at @entity25 in 2011 the officer also claimed that @entity16 troops are not good enough to defeat the insurgents – a statement that is politically embarrassing for the prime minister , as these troops have been trained by @entity4 mentors for the past three years			1
@entity4 ’s exit strategy hinges on national forces being able to combat the @entity11			1
but col @entity15 – the second most senior @entity1 commander in @entity35 – accused politicians of making misleading assessments of @entity1 troops ’ capabilities to justify their decision to accelerate the pull out of international forces			1
tonight mr @entity7 will dine at his country retreat with @entity45 president @entity44 and @entity1 president @entity46 , ahead of in - depth talks on the region ’s security on monday			1
the prime minister has pledged to pull out all @entity4 troops next year , before the next election			1
but already numbers are being cut back and bases in tactically crucial areas being closed down			2
when asked if 2014 was the right time for a handover , col @entity15 said : ‘ no , i would say that it is too early , because the situation will not have ended			1
if the @entity4 leave , the jihadists will see it as a good sign			1
a worldwide jihad will take place			2
’ and when asked if the @entity16 could defeat the @entity11 without international help , he said : ‘ our leaders might say we are able to do the task , but it will be difficult			2
ready for action ? @entity1 forces fire a shell , visible above the left - hand soldier 's head ‘ we have enough soldiers , we have the quantity , but we need the quality			2
we need more professional and better trained commanders			0
‘ do the @entity4 want @entity1 to return to being a @entity11 state ? that is the prospect			1
’ as recently as december , mr @entity7 praised the @entity1 forces for their readiness to tackle the @entity11 after the withdrawal			1
addressing @entity4 troops in @entity25 , he said : ‘ frankly , the @entity1 army is doing better than we expected , there ’s more of them than we expected and that ’s why we are able to bring home so many troops			1
’ col @entity15 , 55 , is the deputy commander of a brigade of 4,500 soldiers in @entity35 , where fighting against the @entity11 has been most intense			1
he is also respected for his resistance to the @entity93 occupation of @entity1 during the @entity94			0
he is in no doubt that pressure from the @entity4 public is the driving force behind the withdrawal of troops from @entity35 , but warned : ‘ people in @entity4 should consider what the future is for @entity1 and the world			1
‘ think about whether you would like @entity1 to go back to being a @entity11 state and a home for terrorism			2
think about throwing away the progress made over the past ten years			0
‘ the biggest problem we have is to provide security in the most volatile areas of the country			0
’ fighting fit : local @entity16 troops in training at @entity117 in @entity35 province , @entity1 whatever his motivation for suggesting that his troops are incapable of resisting the insurgents , col @entity15 ’s comments contrast sharply with the official @entity4 line			1
lieutenant colonel @entity124 , commander of the @entity4 group which oversees the mentoring of @entity1 troops in @entity35 , told @entity18 that the enemy had been reduced to banditry and were no longer worthy of being called ‘ insurgents ’			1
‘ back in 2010 we were holding the @entity16 ’s hands and doing their planning , ’ he said			0
‘ now we are sitting right back			0
in terms of capability they are way past the tipping point and in another year ’s time they will have the ability to manoeuvre all their troops and assets as one			2
‘ when we leave i would expect a stand - off , a power struggle , but with the @entity1 security forces winning out			2
they are more like bandits today			0
they are hardly an insurgency , to call them one is doing them a favour			0
’ many other local commanders also praised the @entity16 , insisting the troops were successfully conducting strike operations against @entity11 strongholds with very limited @entity4 support			1
however , col @entity15 said that the @entity11 would rise after the @entity4 and international forces withdraw , aided by @entity1 ’s neighbours seeking to destabilise the country			1
he said : ‘ @entity45 is at the root of the problem			0
i know what is happening there because i live on the border of @entity1 and @entity45			0
@entity45 is training the @entity11 over the border and giving homes to their commanders			2
the international community needs to put more pressure on @entity45 to stop this before it is too late			0
we know that @entity170 is involved as well			0
’ fine dining : mr @entity7 ( pictured eating breakfast with @entity4 forces at @entity25 in 2010 ) will dine at his country retreat with @entity45 president @entity44 and @entity1 president @entity46 ahead of talks on the region 's security col @entity15 has previously offered first - hand advice to @entity4 politicians			1
in 2011 , he met mr @entity7 in @entity35 , and a photograph of them deep in discussion hangs on his office wall at @entity117 , next to @entity25 , where thousands of local recruits go through basic training			2
last month col @entity15 hosted a visit to @entity117 by armed forces minister @entity188			1
afterwards , mr @entity188 said the transition to @entity1 security was going ‘ extremely well ’			0
col @entity15 has also visited the @entity4 , most recently in december to take part in an exercise to strengthen the relationship between @entity4 and @entity1 officers			1
a @entity196 spokesman said last night : ‘ @entity1 forces are already responsible for more than 75 per cent of the population and by the end of 2014 , @entity1 will have a well - trained and capable national security force of over 300,000			2
‘ the international community ’s support for the @entity203 wo n’t end with the withdrawal of troops at the end of 2014			2
commitments will provide £ 2.5 billion a year for security until 2017 and £ 2.5 billion a year for development to help to underpin @entity1 ’s future stability			2
‘ it is vital that the process is @entity1 - led – this is what the @entity1 people want			0
’ @entity215 troops based at @entity4 ’s bloodiest outpost in @entity35 province have handed control to @entity1 police after finally securing peace there			1
patrol @entity222 , in the province ’s @entity225 district , was once dubbed @entity227 and has seen some of the campaign ’s most intense fighting			0
at least 12 @entity4 soldiers have died there , including two soldiers who were killed , along with 17 injured , in a @entity11 attack in 2009			1

@entity248 was established as part of an advance in 2009 dubbed ‘ @entity251 ’			0
according to @entity253 , 33 , the peaceful situation today is in stark contrast to three years ago when his @entity245 were shot at every day and tracks nearby were laced with deadly mines			0
‘ back then , this place was christened @entity227 , ’ he said			0
‘ if you asked me if i could have foreseen then where we are today , my honest answer would be no. the differences are stark			0
‘ during the six months we spent here in 2010 , we suffered two fatalities , eight life - changing injuries and 17 lesser casualties			0
' we returned to @entity248 in 2012 expecting as many @entity268 [ @entity268 ]			0
but the tracks were clear and we have n’t lost any soldiers since			0
‘ today , the enemy ’s capability appears greatly reduced , families are returning , the people are happy and shops and schools have reopened			0
