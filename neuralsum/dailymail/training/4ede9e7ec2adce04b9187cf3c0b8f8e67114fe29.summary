' in contrast , the former head of the @entity7 police @entity101 said : ' i think @entity0 is alive			1
' he claimed : ' there are too many facts and questions here which do n't add up , far too many			0
' shortly before his disappearance , @entity0 moved his partner @entity108 , a glamorous blonde former model 17 years his junior , and their son @entity111 , then aged three , into a high security £ 3 million apartment in @entity20			1

he feared for his life and surrounded himself with bodyguards while several men were arrested in the aftermath of his disappearance , including a butler with suspected links to the @entity12 secret services , they were freed ' long ago ' , said criminal police chief @entity130			2
@entity7 police have examined a number of theories over the @entity0 's fate , including murder , kidnapping or a faked disappearance , and are known to have visited @entity4 during the probe , but sources say they have failed to make a major breakthrough			1

taxi drivers in @entity28 claimed that on the night of his ' death ' @entity0 had been whisked by car across the border with @entity175			2
deepening the mystery , his £ 9million plane left @entity7 soon after his disappearance and in the following days flew on an unexplained odyssey that took in @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			2
