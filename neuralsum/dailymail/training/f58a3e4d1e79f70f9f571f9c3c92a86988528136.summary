@entity0 , 32 , who is around 11 weeks pregnant with her second child with husband , prince @entity2 , is said to have pulled out of a trip to @entity4 , @entity5 , on monday			1
she had been planning to visit @entity12 sailor sir @entity15 's @entity14 team at its new £ 12million headquarters at @entity18 in @entity19			1
however , it was reported today that she has been forced to cancel the official visit next week because she continues to suffer from hyperemesis gravidarum - a severe vomiting condition which saw her hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby , @entity26 , now one			1
the @entity27 reported that a royal source had confirmed @entity0 's trip to @entity4 had been cancelled and said she had no plans to undertake any other official engagements before next week			1
@entity32 said : ' her engagements are being reviewed on a case by case basis			0
any future engagements will be announced in due course			1
' it is the latest in a string of official engagements to be cancelled by the @entity6 as she continues to battle the vomiting condition			1
last week , she had to cancel an appearance at a new project in @entity45 , organised by @entity46 of the charities of which is she patron			1
at the time , @entity32 said the @entity6 was ' hugely disappointed ' at having to pull out			0
@entity6 did , however , send a personally - penned message to be read out to the disappointed children			0
in it she apologised for not being there , saying she was ' truly sorry ' at having to cancel , but promised to see the venue for herself soon			1
her cancelled engagements have set tongues wagging that she may be pregnant with twins , with one leading doctor explaining that a multiple pregnancy can make morning sickness worse			1
speaking to the @entity61 , consultant gynaecologist dr @entity60 said : ' @entity62 is a pregnancy hormone secreted by the placenta and in twins , far more of this hormone is released			2
' as @entity62 is associated with nausea women carrying twins can experience worse morning sickness			2
' in fact one of the first things we do if a woman comes to me experiencing hyperemesis gravidarum is scan them , not only to check the baby but also to check for twins			0
pictured : @entity0 with sir @entity15 in @entity45 in june @entity0 , who is around 11 weeks pregnant , suffered the same illness in her first pregnancy with @entity26 the @entity83 ’s last official engagement was on august 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the @entity85 with her husband @entity2 ( together above ) and @entity87 ' it is obviously not a hard and fast rule and pregnancy differs with every woman			1
' @entity92 , @entity60 and @entity93 at @entity94 in @entity45 and @entity95 @entity96 , added : ' in twins expectant mothers experience twice the hormones , and so often twice the sickness			2
' as a result of @entity0 's severe morning sickness , @entity32 has been unusually circumspect about announcing engagements			1
@entity6 has not been seen in public since news of her pregnancy was released by @entity32 last month			2
her last official engagement was on august 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the @entity85 with her husband @entity2 and prince @entity87			2
her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12 - week stage but there is speculation that the royal couple 's second child could be due in april			1
her pregnancy has not yet passed the 12 - week stage but there is speculation the baby could be due in april the @entity118 's surgeon - gynaecologist @entity117 ( pictured ) is part of the @entity83 's medical team @entity121 affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies			1
the condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘ pregnancy hormone ’ @entity62 , or human chorionic gonadotropin , which increases after conception			2
it causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration , weight loss and a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine , called ketosis			0
it is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers			0
the severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day , with exhausting and hazardous consequences			0
they can not eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week			0
it can trigger a build - up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food			0
hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux , where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat			0
hospital treatment for these women is essential , as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated			0
treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration , as well as supplementation of vitamin b , one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition			0
an intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice			0
the condition can also affect the baby ’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight			0
in severe cases , the sickness can trigger a miscarriage .			2
