by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 _ @entity2 will step up their pursuit of @entity6 full - back @entity4 after @entity9 ’s final @entity8 group game against @entity10 on tuesday evening			1
former @entity2 manager @entity11 did much of the ground - work to convince the 18 - year - old that his future lies at @entity15 before he was sacked at the end of april and it is understood that a wage package has been agreed that would make @entity4 the highest earning youngster at @entity15 , with a weekly salary approaching £ 100,000 - a - week			1
@entity2 made their first move with a £ 27million offer towards the end of may but progress stalled after the two clubs failed to push through the signing before @entity4 ’s involvement in the @entity8 , while @entity6 ’s change of manager adding to the complications			2
new manager @entity41 is aware of the need for reinforcements in the @entity2 back - line and although @entity46 has been retained for one more year , the @entity45 is aware that the 33 - year - old can not be expected to play almost every game as he did last season under @entity11			0
current understudy @entity50 will be moved on this summer , with @entity51 in pole position to sign the left - back			0
it leaves @entity2 in urgent need of a new full - back and they have been encouraged that the player has made it clear to @entity6 that he would like a move to @entity2 to go through and executive vice-chairman @entity59 will look to secure the @entity9 star ’s signature once @entity9 return from @entity63 on wednesday			2
high flyer : but @entity46 is now 33 and ca n't play every game for @entity2 blow : @entity67 receives treatment before @entity70 's 1 - 0 win over @entity71 on sunday @entity2 will not , however , be held to ransom and if negotiations were to slow down once more , they may be forced to look at alternatives , with @entity76 ’s @entity75 emerging as a £ 12.5million target following his impressive performances for @entity80 ’s @entity79 at the @entity8			1
@entity2 , meanwhile , will wait until after the @entity8 to make a formal offer in the region of £ 9million to @entity83 for defender @entity67			1
the @entity85 defender is privately confident that personal terms are in place with the @entity15 club , with @entity67 ’s contract at @entity83 expiring next summer			0
the 28 - year - old ’s close friendship with @entity93 is believed to have helped matters , while @entity2 see the move as a pragmatic solution to the void of @entity99 experience that has been left following the departures of @entity101 and @entity102 .			0

@entity6 are holding out for closer to £ 30million for *teenager*
@entity4 will become the highest earning youngster at @entity15
@entity9 play final @entity8 group game against @entity10 on tuesday
@entity2 will wait to make £ 9m bid for @entity83 's @entity67
