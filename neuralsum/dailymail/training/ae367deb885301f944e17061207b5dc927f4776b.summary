@entity0 , the @entity1 batsman who has died from a brain injury two days after being struck in the head by a bouncer , was a spirited young cricketer who some said ' had the world at his feet '			1
the son of banana farmer from the northern @entity1 town of @entity9 who was dropped from the @entity12 test team five times , but who never gave up is being remembered for his defiant attitude in the face of adversity			1
as cricketers , friends and family gathered around his bedside at @entity22 for the 48 hours following his injury , the prayers and tributes for @entity0 - as a cricketer , a mate and a great bloke - poured in			1
' @entity29 ' or ' @entity30 ' , as he was nicknamed , was an immensely likeable and also humble , understated and hardworking team mate for the @entity12 , @entity32 and @entity33 squads			0
@entity0 ' achievements as a young cricketer - he was due to celebrate his 26th birthday this sunday - include making 26 first class centuries ; as @entity39 coach @entity34 pointed out this week while flying back to @entity40 to see @entity0 , at his age , @entity34 had only made one			1
@entity0 cap was @entity92 no. 408 heart and drive : @entity0 , pictured , left , in 2008 during the @entity95 in @entity96 , and , right , in july , 2013 , when he was playing for @entity97 , @entity98 mates : rugby league star @entity100 and boxing trainer , @entity101 ( pictured in 2012 in @entity102 ) were friends of @entity0 who supported him by attending his cricket matches @entity0 made a total of 15,789 runs in his first class career and many of those were ones or twos - as he laughingly recalled some years ago , he was n't a big scorer of fours or sixes			1
the left - handed opener was the son of @entity117 , who cleared a patch on his farm for young @entity120 to practice cricket , and mother @entity78 , who is of @entity124 origin			1
growing up with sister , @entity126 , and brother , @entity128 , as a teenager he often helped out hauling heavy bunches of bananas for the family business			0
as a schoolboy , he was also a talented rugby league player who played alongside another @entity9 boy , the future @entity135 star @entity134			0
seven years ago almost to the day , just before his 19th birthday , @entity0 made his debut in first class cricket scoring a spot in the @entity1 side			1
as a 20 - year - old , he won the the @entity142 , accepting the award in @entity144 during the @entity146 presentations in february 2009			1
@entity0 at 20 : @entity147 stands before the @entity12 flag for a portrait during a @entity73 players camp at @entity151 , on the @entity153 @entity152 in august , 2010 in the steps of a legend : @entity147 poses with his award after being named @entity142 in @entity144 during the @entity158 presentations in february 2009 in the nets : @entity0 waiting to take his turn to bat in the nets at a practice session at the @entity164 in @entity165 in december , 2010 , ahead of the third @entity166 against @entity98 the fall : @entity147 was 63 not out when he was bowled a bouncer at the @entity168 on tuesday and struck in the head , falling to the ground with a brain injury from which he died on thursday			1
his death has shocked @entity173 and the cricket world grief : cricket players embrace at @entity22 after visiting their mate , @entity0 , as he lay gravely injured in the @entity178 following his tragic head injury while playing the game he loved since @entity0 ' stunning 2009 test debut at the age of 20 in @entity60 , he had been dropped five times , which might have defeated a less determined player			2
but despite controversies over his style , technique and his off - field activities with the friends he keeps , @entity0 always plugged on , taking on the verbal bouncers along with those on the field			2
he was friends with @entity195 , the controversial boxer 's colourful manager , @entity101 and rugby league player @entity100 , who all have attended his matches to support the young opener			1
in return the cricketer sat ringside at @entity195 's fights			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) walks out of the @entity168 dressing room on tuesday to open the batting for @entity173 in a @entity206 innings which ended when he was fatally struck in the head prone to periodic run droughts due to a perceived inability to deal with the short ball , @entity0 test average was 32.65			2
in 2009 , after being presented with the @entity12 @entity212 , he stepped up to the crease for his first test match , in @entity60			0
in that test series , @entity0 became the youngest @entity12 player in cricketing history to score back - to - back centuries in his debut , which he achieved in the @entity49			0
@entity0 was selected to play the @entity221 series in @entity98 , but was dropped when the @entity223 bowlers pitched short balls to him in an effort to exploit his weaknesses			2
but what he may have lacked occasionally in technique , he made up for with heart and drive			0
in the 2010/2011 @entity233 series , selectors ignored him except as an injury replacement for @entity235 in the final test ; he toured @entity237 in late 2011 and scored 126 in the third test			0
but in the @entity102 tour that summer , poor performance saw him dropped and he signed a contract to play county cricket for @entity97 in @entity98 and work on his technique			0
in january 2011 , @entity0 was stunned to be accused of ' cheating ' by @entity223 cricket legend sir @entity245 after being bowled a bouncer in the @entity247 by @entity248 and staying on the field after what was initially thought to be a catch			0
that year , @entity0 decided to make the wrenching decision to transfer away from his friends and his family in @entity1 to @entity173 for the good of his game - and it paid off			1
@entity100 , @entity195 and @entity101 ( left to right , pictured ) were good friends and supporters of @entity260 , @entity0 , who has died two days after he was struck in the head by a bouncer during a @entity206 match at the @entity168 in 2012 , he was the @entity206 's highest run scorer and was selected for the 2012/2013 @entity266 tour of @entity173			1
he was rumoured to be up for a $ 1 million @entity73 contract and in january last year he became the first @entity12 batsman to score a debut century in one day international cricket			0
last october , @entity0 made his twenty20 international cricket debut for @entity173 in the @entity272			0
before his injury at the @entity168 on tuesday , he was up for selection in next week 's test against @entity50 at the @entity276 in @entity277			2
he had played 26 test matches and @entity12 selector and cricketing legend @entity279 described @entity0 as ' a hell of a good batsman '			0
as cricketers , legends of the game and mates said after the news came on thursday afternoon of @entity147 ' death : ' his time was just around the corner ... he was about to come into his own ' .			0
