a mother has warned parents about the dangers of @entity3 after it triggered kidney failure in her 12 year - old son			1
@entity7 , 39 , treated her son @entity8 with the recommended dose of liquid ibuprofen when he complained of a sore throat and a temperature			1
the bottle was labelled as being suitable for children aged three months to 12 years - old and @entity8 recovered from his illness			1
danger : @entity17 , 12 , suffered kidney failure two weeks after taking @entity3 for a sore throat but a couple of weeks later he started to vomit and complained of severe stomach pains			1
his gp was unable to pinpoint the problem and diagnosed stress and stomach issues			2
but the pain did not subside and a blood test on @entity29 revealed @entity8 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , had kidney problems			1
he was sent to @entity33 where a biopsy showed he had an inflammation of the kidney called tubulointerstitial nephritis , which causes kidney failure			1
doctors told his parents his condition was a side - effect of taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen - an ingredient in @entity46			1
they stressed he had not had an allergic reaction to the medicine			0
@entity8 spent a total of eight days in hospital but is now back home and has returned to school			1
medicine : the bottle was labelled as being suitable for children aged three months to 12 years he is taking steroids to ' kick - start ' his kidneys and is on a low - potassium diet to aid his recovery			2
mrs @entity7 , a hr manager , said she felt guilty for giving him the drugs but said she had been told it is a common problem			1
she said : ' it was horrible watching him go through it			0
' i felt guilty because i 'd given him the @entity70 , but i just gave him a normal dose for three days			1
' i was surprised when we were told the @entity70 had caused @entity8 's problems but a nurse said they see a lot of similar cases			1
' the worst case scenario is that his @entity8 's kidneys do not recover			2
' we still do n't know how his condition will develop , ' his mother said			2
' if that happens then obviously there is still a possibility that he would need dialysis or a transplant			0
' i feel really surprised that something that is aimed at children can be so dangerous			0
' the warnings about the side - effects are on the leaflet inside the @entity94 box but not displayed externally			2
@entity8 said that he is confused why it is described by the firm as a ' rare ' problem when it affects up to five per cent of users			2
he said : ' on christmas day i got really bad stomach pains			1
i could n't eat my @entity101 dinner			0
' i could n't move because it hurt so much and i did n't really know what was happening			0
' if i met the owner of the company that makes @entity46 , i 'd ask them why it causes kidney problems			1
' and i would ask why it says this is a rare problem when it happens to one to five per cent of people who take it			0
' they should put a warning on the bottle because not a lot of people read the leaflet			2
' action : mr and mrs @entity7 are now calling on @entity46 's parent company @entity122 to place a prominent warning on packaging about the possibility of kidney problems his father @entity127 , 44 , a warehouse manager , said : ' as a parent , watching your child go through that , you fear the worst			1
' every time he got stomach pains he was in agony and going white			1
on one occasion he went grey			0
' he was very brave about it			0
he had about 18 blood tests			0
' mr and mrs @entity7 are now calling on @entity46 's parent company @entity122 to place a prominent warning on packaging about the possibility of kidney problems			1
in a statement , @entity70 said : ' we and we are very sorry to hear about @entity17 ’s condition , we wish him a swift and full recovery			0
' we have informed our consumer safety team who will be in touch with the family to find out more about the case and investigate further			0
' @entity152 reports of acute renal failure with ibuprofen are classified as ‘ very rare ’ by the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) , which means less than one in 10,000 cases			2
' we encourage all consumers to report any adverse events to help us monitor and ensure the continuing good safety profile of these products			0
' ' based on our internal safety monitoring data of the last 5 years , the incidence of serious renal impairment was less than 1 case per 30 million exposures of @entity3			0
' @entity168 , of the @entity169 , told @entity170 : ' although very rare when severe side effects with medicines occur , they can have a serious impact			0
' if after taking even a relatively safe medicine like ibuprofen you feel unwell , always consult a pharmacist to see if symptoms are due to side effects or an adverse reaction			0
