his beanie hat may be slightly askew but @entity2 is talking straight			1
for the first time since leaving @entity4 last summer he opens up about his disappointment at the manner in which his successful five - year spell ended			1
@entity2 is still confused by decisions made by @entity9 and @entity10 to omit him from their line - ups , most crushingly from last season 's @entity13 final , and how a lack of action hampered his chance of cementing an @entity19 place			1
this is not to suggest he is gloomy			0
chatting after training with @entity22 he is quite the opposite			1
@entity2 is back playing regularly and enjoying the responsibility that comes from being an experienced figure in a side of humbler aspirations			1
@entity2 is all smiles at training ahead of @entity22 's clash against @entity30 @entity2 is an experienced figure within the @entity22 changing room and is enjoying the responsibility after a string of injuries kept him out at the start of this season the @entity22 star has impressed the centre - back is back playing regular football since his move on a free transfer to the @entity22 lescott is still confused by @entity9 and @entity10 's decisions to omit him from their line - ups the defender began to grow accustomed to being sidelined towards the end of his @entity4 career he has not given up that desire to play for his country again , either			1
' i still feel i could have played more games last season but it was n't to be , ' he says			0
' my decision was to go somewhere i could play more regularly and since i have been fit i have done that			2
' the omens are good for @entity22 ’s @entity2 on monday night			1
it ’s almost exactly three years to the day since the defender was in @entity4 ’s team as they thrashed local rivals @entity30 6 - 1 at @entity62			1
@entity2 even set up a goal for @entity64			1
knee and calf niggles prohibited his involvement at the start of this campaign but he has been a source of strength in @entity73 's team for the past three games			0
@entity30 provide the opposition on monday and the prospect of facing @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 is enough to have any defender checking whether the hamstrings feel a bit tight			1
he relishes a duel with such adversaries			1
he was , after all , in the @entity4 side that won 6 - 1 at @entity62 three years ago this week			1
later that season he was also in the defence that secured a 1 - 0 win over @entity30 which had even greater significance			2
@entity22 face @entity30 on monday and @entity2 will relish the prospect of facing @entity77 if @entity2 continues to play well in the lead up to the next @entity19 match he is confident he will get a call - up a fortnight later @entity2 lifted the @entity95 trophy , having played 31 @entity95 matches			1
he held the trophy again in may but this time after only 10 league appearances			0
' i got a medal , ' he says			0
' it was still really enjoyable , it just did n't feel the same			0
' it is notable that @entity2 's greater frustration came from being left out for the @entity13 final			1
' i played every minute , captained the semi-final , then not playing ( in the final ) was the hardest part			2
' @entity10 did not explain why @entity107 would be starting instead			0
' he just read out the team and my name was n't there ' , @entity2 remembers			1
' we won and then he explained why he did n't pick @entity112 ( @entity113 )			0
it was because @entity115 ( @entity116 ) had played more minutes			0
i was like , ' if that 's the reason for him , why is n't that a reason for me ? ' that bewilderment can be traced back to the summer after @entity4 won their first @entity95 title			1
@entity2 played every minute of @entity19 's @entity122 campaign , scoring against @entity123 , but returned to find @entity9 questioning his mentality			1
' i heard an interview with @entity9 saying i had lost confidence , ' recalls @entity2			1
' i thought that was strange because we had won the league , i had gone to the @entity130 , scored , and i did n't think my confidence could get any higher			0
' the former @entity4 defender has played against some of the best strikers in the world he went on to play 33 times that season but more frequently from the bench			1
@entity10 took over and his trust in @entity107 , despite the @entity141 's initial struggles , pushed @entity2 further to the sidelines			2
' a manager has no allegiance to a player they have n't bought , ' says @entity2			2
' they think , ' he 's from the old team			0
if i do n't pick him , he 's not going to be seen as my mistake '			0
' when it came to moving on , @entity2 liked speaking to @entity153 manager @entity152 but chose @entity154 , with whom he worked at @entity156			2
there was no £ 22million fee this time but there was pressure to perform nonetheless			0
' when i was injured i was gutted for him ( @entity154 ) , ' says @entity2			2
' he said , ' take your time			0
i do n't want you 80 per cent fit sitting on the bench			0
' that was a weight off my shoulders			0
now we 're showing what he 's been working on in training			0
' victories over @entity171 and @entity172 preceded a narrow defeat at @entity174			0
@entity2 believes , at 32 , he could get back into the @entity19 reckoning if this promising start grows			1
he was on the bench for a friendly in @entity179 last year but has not been in @entity181 's squad since			2
after victories over @entity171 and @entity182 believes he could get back into the @entity19 reckoning the 32 - year - old has won 26 caps for @entity19 since his debut in a 3 - 0 win against @entity187 in october 2007 @entity188 and @entity189 have been a regular partnership in @entity181 's @entity19 selections ' after the euros i got the feeling ( @entity188 ) @entity188 was going to be the next focal point and it was an opportunity for someone to play alongside him			1
i felt it was mine to stake a claim but it was stop - start at @entity4			1
i 've only played three games this season ( so ) for me to say i should be back in the squad would be disrespectful			2
if i continue to play the same level up to the next international then hopefully i will be closer			0
' @entity2 also offers an interesting analysis of @entity30 's defensive troubles			2
' @entity207 halves have to play together as a partnership , ' he says			0
' @entity209 and @entity77 can play off the cuff and win the game			1
as a defender you ca n't			0
i ca n't suddenly just go into midfield and think , ' that was great ' because my mate at the back could be being roasted			0
once @entity30 get that unit playing regularly they will be fine			0
' @entity2 argues that against @entity30 it will be easier to defend because knowing the calibre of the opponent focuses the mind and guards against lapses			2
' that side of it will be fun , ' he smiles before denying that a repeat of @entity231 's 5 - 3 victory would be satisfactory — ' even if we win , i would n't be happy conceding three			0
