in an interview , the 80 - year - old , who has played @entity15 for five decades , called for anonymity for those accused of child sex offences until they had been convicted of any charges			1
he said celebrities can sometimes be caught in a trap by ‘ sexually active groupies ’ who , he appeared to suggest , are younger than they look			1

discussing the @entity37 sex abuse scandal , @entity1 – a member of the spiritual @entity35 – said : ‘ if you accept that you are pure love , and if you know that you are pure love and therefore live that pure love , these things wo n’t happen to you			1
’ his interviewer commented : ‘ to some people that sounds perhaps like you ’re saying victims bring things on themselves – is that what you ’re saying ? ’ @entity1 replied : ‘ no , not quite , and yet yes i am , because everything that happens to us has been a result of what we have been in previous lives or whatever			1
’ he went on to call for anonymity for all those accused of child sex offences because of the stigma they faced even if innocent			2
he said : ‘ paedophiles should be sought out , rooted out and dealt with			2
‘ but there ’s a fringe of people who , particularly pop singers , they have these groupies , these girls , who come , they ’re sexually active , sexually mature , they do n’t ask for their birth certificate , they do n’t know what age they may be			2
‘ these people are instantly stigmatised , some will be innocent , some will not , but until such time as it ’s proven there should be anonymity for both			2
’ he added : ‘ if someone has done something wrong , the law will take its course			0
but even so , all of them , whether they are proven guilty or not , we should not be judgmental about anybody , ever			0
‘ we should n’t go around condemning , unforgiving			0
we should all be totally forgiving about everything			0
’ his comments drew stinging criticism from the @entity98 in @entity99 , which called them an insult to abuse victims			1
outspoken : @entity2 's @entity1 is facing a storm of controversy today after claiming that sex abuse victims bring it on themselves during an astonishing tv interview dr @entity108 , from @entity109 , condemned @entity1 ’s ‘ hippy - dippy ’ spiritualist beliefs , saying child sex abuse left people with horrific physical and mental scars			1
the @entity114 described the actor ’s comments as ‘ bizarre ’ and ‘ not helpful ’			1
@entity117 , head of the @entity114 ’s sexual abuse programme , said : ‘ we should be concentrating on helping the thousands of children sexually abused every year who need therapy to re-build their lives			1
’ @entity1 , who has been in @entity33 promoting a @entity2 stage show , later said he was ‘ very sorry ’ for any offence that has been caused as a result of his comments			1
‘ i would never say that victims of sexual offences are in any way responsible for the abuse they have suffered and i offer my deepest apologies if anything i have said has been misunderstood in this way , ’ he added			1
but in an interview with @entity137 , @entity1 said : ‘ life is what you make it			1
' we do come in to life to learn from certain experiences and broadly some of the major experiences we have asked to go through , this is my understanding of life			0

’ break up : the @entity2 star split up with tv weathergirl @entity184 , his 44 - year - old partner of three years , to focus on the soap and his spiritual side rather than sex and relationships his comments on being ‘ forgiving ’ towards paedophiles chime with remarks he has made about @entity193			1
he said : ‘ no one is naturally bad , everyone is inherently a very beautiful , spiritual being			0
’ on @entity198 , he said : ‘ if you want to get rid of that evil you do n’t let him rot in prison			0
if we throw real love at him eventually he will realise what he did was n’t right			0
’ at the end of the nineties @entity1 ended up bankrupt following a libel battle with @entity209 for calling him ‘ boring @entity15 ’			1
he won the case but was judged to have wasted court time with the law suit and was awarded only £ 50,000 , the amount the paper had offered him to settle out of court			0
