polar bears leave messages for each other in the footprints they leave in the snow , according to new research			1
biologists have found that the @entity8 carnivores produce smelly chemicals from the soles of their feet at different times of the year that create scent trails across the ice			1
this is thought to help the solitary bears communicate with one another in their huge , icy territories			2
polar bears , like above , use their smelly feet to send messages to each other over their vast icy territories the scientists found that bears tended to be attracted to foot scents taken from bears of the opposite sex , particularly if it is from a fertile female during the breeding season			1
they believe the bears may leave behind distinctive scents from their smelly feet to help attract mates and avoid clashes between large aggressive males			1
the researchers also found that the paws of polar bears have abnormally large sweat glands and strange clumps of hair growing from single hair follicles			1
a team of scientists have recently reported that chemical pollutants accumulating in the @entity8 may be reducing the density of the bones in the penises of male polar bears			2
the researchers from @entity51 in @entity52 found that polychlorinated biphenyls ( @entity54 ) are associated with a less dense penile bone			0
they have previously shown bears that have high levels of pollutants named organohalogens , which include @entity54 , in their bodies , have smaller than average penis bones and testes			0
organohalogens contain at least one halogen such as fluorine or chlorine , and are used as solvents and pesticides , as well as in the making of dyes and drugs			0
pcbs were used to make paints and rubber goods in the 1930s , but were banned in 2001 after scientists discovered they can cause cancer			0
the researchers warn that the presence of such chemicals , which tend to accumulate over time in the bodies of top predators from the prey they eat , may have disastrous consequences for polar bear mating			0
they claim that these could be responsible for depositing the scent on the ground wherever the animal stands			0
dr @entity90 , a biologist who led the study at the @entity92 at @entity93 in @entity94 , said that the polar bears were unusual as most mammals leave their scent by rubbing their bodies or spraying urine onto their surroundings			1
she said : ' the polar bear relies instead on disseminating scent across a vast and relatively featureless landscape via pedal scents			2
' we documented both seasonal variation and intersexual differences in chemosensory behavior and these results provided some support for our hypotheses of the function that pedal chemosignals play in regulating social and reproductive behavior in the species			0
' it is possible that the chemical composition , and potentially information content , of pedal scent changes with the season			0
' polar bears may have evolved this unusual form of leaving messages in scent from their feet due to the barren landscape in which they live			1
while most animals can rub against trees , rocks and other objects , the @entity8 ice shelves that polar bears inhabit are almost completely flat			2
their ranges can extend to more than 370,000 miles ( 600,000km )			0
scientists in the past have observed polar bears sniffing each other tracks and even following them after having a smell			2
while polar bears are known to have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom , dr @entity143 and her colleagues decided to investigate whether there was more to this behaviour than idle curiosity			2
in perhaps one of the more dangerous examples of the persuit of knowledge , dr @entity143 and her team collected scent samples from the feet of 203 wild polar bears by rubbing cotton buds between their toes			1
they then tested the reaction to each of these samples by 26 captive polar bears housed in 10 zoos around @entity170			2
researchers found enlarged sweat glands and strange clumps of fur on the paws of female polar bears polar bears have been seen to sniff and then sometimes follow the tracks left by other polar bears they hung the scent samples in boxes near to the captive bears and recorded their interest according to their response - approaching the box , sniffing the box , curling their upper lip and snuffing the scent with their mouths			1
in general the bears were more interested in the scent from feet of bears of the opposite sex , with males showing almost twice as much interest in the scent of fertile females than non fertile females			0
@entity202 females were also more interested in the scent of males while males would approach the scent of males but show little interest beyond that			0
dr @entity143 said : ' given the energetic constraints of life on the sea ice , accurate identification of potential mates or adversaries may be essential for reproductive success and survival			0
' the scent investigation patterns likely reflect the need to identify potential mates prior to making the energetic commitment to pursue them			0
melting ice could make it harder for polar bears to detect and follow the scent trails left by their neighbours ' the male investigatory preference for female over male odors , coupled with the lack of discrimination of male from female odors by females , is consistent with the notion that male polar bears must identify and locate potential mates , while females only need to signal their reproductive readiness and recruit males to them			1
' the researchers , whose results are published in the @entity240 , also examined the paws to two dead female polar bears in detail to understand how the scent may be produced			1
they found the bears had enlarged sweat pores and unusual large clumps of hair growing from single hair follicles that might help deposit the scent			1
dr @entity143 added that changes to the @entity8 habitat as sea ice melts and disappears could have a dramatic impact on the ability of polar bears to use these scent trails			1
she said : ' effective communication is essential for successful reproduction in solitary , wide - ranging animals			0
' developing an understanding of how communication is tied to the environment may enhance our ability to predict the impacts of rapid environmental change on populations			0
' dr @entity270 , chief scientist for @entity271 , added : ' this is fascinating new research that suggests scents deposited when polar bears simply walk over the sea ice may play a role in the polar bear â€™s social and reproductive behavior			2
' however , this method of communication , which may be instrumental in helping polar bears find their mates , may be at risk in a warming @entity8 , as scent trails increasingly are broken up by melting ice			1

biologists rubbed cotton wool buds between the toes of wild polar bears
they found the bears produce powerful scents that other bears can detect
researchers from @entity93 in @entity94 examined how bears reacted
male bears are attracted to the scent from the feet of fertile female bears
they tended to avoid approaching scents from the feet of other male bears
large pores and hair clumps on their feet may help bears leave their scent
most other animals leave their scent in urine or by rubbing their bodies
the scent trails may help polar bears communicate over their vast ranges
some fear that melting ice will make it harder for bears to leave messages
