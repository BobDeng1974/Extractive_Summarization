@entity0 ( right ) and @entity8 ( left ) are looking to sell a 20 per cent stake in @entity1 @entity0 says he believes the club will be worth £ 400million when they move to the @entity12 ' we 've no desire to give up the whole club , ' @entity0 said			1
' but we 're still £ 110million in debt - albeit now £ 55million of that is to ourselves			0
so the third - party debt has been halved , but only because we 've put the money in			0
' we lost £ 30million when we went down ( to the @entity25 in 2011 ) and we made £ 10million on paper last year			0
what 's on paper is not cash - flow and we have to pay down the debt all the time and we have to be clear of bank debt when we move to the @entity12			2
' i 'd love someone to come in and buy 20 per cent and the money would not go to us , it would go to the club			2
but we wo n't be giving it away and we 'd want market value for it			0
the @entity1 have been in excellent form and sit fifth in the @entity42 table @entity43 has been widely praised for an excellent start to the season , but has not got long on his contract ' going to the @entity12 we are a £ 400million club and that would pay down most of the debt			1
but if it does n't happen we 'll dig deep in our pockets and keep the club afloat			0
' with @entity1 challenging at the top end of the @entity42 after an outstanding start to the campaign , @entity0 also admitted he did not yet know if manager @entity43 - under pressure seven months ago - would sign a new contract with the club			2
' i must say if come april we are where we are now , which is extremely unlikely but is possible , we 'd probably sit down a month early and say , ' @entity61 , do you want to stay or do you want to go ? ' @entity43 may decide he wants to go out a winner , ' @entity0 said .			0
