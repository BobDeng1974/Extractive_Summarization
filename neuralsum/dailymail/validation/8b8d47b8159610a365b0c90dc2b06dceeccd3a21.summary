it might be one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar but some of the arrivals at @entity6 today appeared to have dressed for the club rather than the parade ring			2
although rural staples such as tweed , fur and @entity14 wellies were present and correct , other race goers opted to take advantage of the bright @entity17 sunshine and stepped out in wool mini skirts , worn with knee - length boots			1
print also proved a hit , with one brave lady choosing a cheerful ensemble comprised of a leopard print bag combined with a matching coat , boots and tights , while another opted for head - to - toe zebra print			0
warm coats in an array of colourful hues proved particularly popular , with feather - festooned millinery used to ramp up the glamour along with opulent fur cuffs and collars			0
@entity51 appears to be an early contender in the racing season style stakes , with scores of ladies opting for the colour in a whole range of shades , from cornflower to cobalt			0
whatever the colour , the vast majority appeared cheerful as they arrived to see the action on day one of what is one of the most prestigious events on the @entity93 racing calendar			0
joining them was the first royal guest of the season , @entity97 , who cut a glamorous figure in a dark blue wool coat created especially for the royal by designer @entity101 , a matching hat and oversized sunglasses			0
tomorrow will see the 33 - year - old joined at the @entity6 by her aunt , the @entity105 , who has long been a racing enthusiast and is due to present a prize to the winner of the @entity109			1
variety : racegoers chose a diverse array of outfits , with many staying warm in coats while others opted for summery get - ups ( centre ) matching pairs : some racegoers chose to coordinate their ensembles , with matching outfits made up of tweed ( left ) or leather seen on course chic : fur was a recurring motif , as was animal print ( centre )			1
some racegoers also opted for the colour of the season , delicate pale pink bright spark : a lady arrives dressed in a cheerful coral ensemble teamed with a bright orange handbag and a pair of turquoise trainers colourful : a lady dressed in a cosy cream cardigan and a crimson cocktail hat arrives for her day out at the races country classics : gentlemen arriving for the opening day of the @entity6 opted for classic tweed or chinos hats you win ! headwear ranged from classic floppy fedoras to wide brimmed dress hats and delicate cocktail numbers well - wrapped up : vast fur hats teamed with sunglasses is a classic @entity6 combination , as these ladies demonstrate @entity160 is back : many of the ladies arriving at @entity6 opted for wintry black but livened things up by leaving coats at home @entity167 : it was n't only the ladies who opted for bright looks , with one gentleman wearing red cords , while another opted for a pink suit despite the large royal contingent , the real highlight , on the track at least , is set to be friday 's @entity178 , which will see veteran jockey @entity179 make his final attempt at the classic race aboard @entity182			1
@entity179 also featured in the first day 's racing at @entity6 and piloted the hotly - tipped @entity184 , a dark bay six - year - old gelding , in the @entity187 this afternoon			1
unfortunately for @entity179 , the race was taken by hot favourite @entity189 , with the @entity192 six - year - old battling home to give jockey @entity193 his third winner of the day			1
off the course , most of the entertainment came from @entity17 's increasingly fashionable style set , who had pulled out all the stops on a very sunny day one			2
with most eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots , the race meeting is usually a masterclass in country chic , complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two			2
big arrival : racegoers dressed in their best arrive for a day out at the races on the first day of the @entity6 going for gold in the style stakes : racegoers are all smiles as they arrive for a sunny day out at the @entity6 top tweed : a racegoer makes the most of the spring sunshine in a chic tweed short suit in summery cornflower blue tough choice : while some racegoers opted to dress down in wellies and tweed jackets , others came dressed to the nines mix and match : texture is a key party of @entity6 style with tapestry , relaxed wool tweed and traditional @entity237 check all popular unlike @entity239 - and from this year , @entity238 - organisers at @entity6 refuse to impose a dress code on guests and , beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend , say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress			1
while fancy dress does creep in on @entity247 's thursday , @entity17 's most fashionable tend to opt for a glamorous take on rural , with oversized sunglasses , pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante			0
fur is a recurring motif , as are hats that take inspiration from rural life			0
like the stylish effort unveiled by @entity97 on day one of the 2014 event , many come festooned with pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite			0
male racegoers are n't immune from the pull of country style either , with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie			2
all white : the sunny weather brought an early season outbreak of white jeans , for both men and women , in its wake stylish : floral print , a perennial favourite on race day , also proved popular among guests arriving at @entity6 family day out : @entity6 has long been a family favourite , although groups of friends are a common sight on the racecourse sunny day : sunglasses proved an essential accessory as racegoers enjoyed sunny weather on day one of the @entity6 looking good : @entity97 cut a glamorous figure in her elegant dark blue ensemble on day one of the @entity6 enjoying the day : many of the gentlemen arriving at @entity6 chose bright colours , whether yellow or blue and green tartan ( centre ) mixing it up : while some racegoers opted for @entity239 style florals , others chose full - scale country looks complete with knee - length boots keeping warm : the bright sunshine was n't incentive enough for some , with many racegoers opting for warm coats instead of short skirts rural : many racegoers chose a classic country look featuring cosy wool or tweed overcoats and leather boots by country brand , @entity316 dapper : a group of gentlemen arrive dressed in jeans and smart shirts enlivened with tailored tweed jackets all the trimmings : fur and suede are perennial favourites when it comes to choosing a hat for @entity6 under starter 's orders : racegoers seated on benches enjoy the sunny weather while they inspect the course wondering who to have a flutter on ? @entity337 ' @entity336 reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at this week 's @entity6			1
today - @entity340 horse : @entity189 @entity341 : 11/10 he 's called faugheen the machine for a reason and it 's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on tuesday , despite the impressive field			1
worth a flutter : @entity189 , pictured here on the gallops yesterday , is a popular choice among punters betting on the @entity340 @entity354 jockey , @entity193 , is yet to decide his mount for the race , with stablemate and dual @entity340 winner @entity358 also lining up , but with fingers pointing towards @entity189 it 's just another reason to back him			1
wednesday - @entity109 horse : dodging bullets @entity341 : 4/1 all eyes might be on @entity363 and @entity364 , but @entity365 has easily had the most impressive route to this year 's @entity6 , and although a short price the @entity368 winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting			2
thursday : ladbrokes world hurdle horse : @entity376 du @entity375 @entity341 : 9/2 @entity378 ' stranglehold at the top of the @entity380 betting has tightened again following @entity382 's withdrawal			0
it 's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite , but with @entity375 back over hurdles it can only be a good thing			0
veteran : @entity179 makes his way into the @entity6 for the very last time as a jockey he gallops and jumps well , and his @entity392 win shows he can do it at @entity6 @entity394 horse : @entity182 @entity341 : 10/1 it 's impossible to not back @entity179 's last ever ride in the @entity178 - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey			0
there 's still doubts whether favourite @entity401 can finally make it third time lucky at @entity6 , but for the old romantics there 's only one man that can win this year 's @entity178 , and it 's @entity179			0
good work : former @entity411 banker @entity410 ( second right ) celebrates with @entity193 after his horse @entity189 triumphed celebrations : @entity193 enjoyed his second victory of the day aboard @entity416 in the @entity417 victory : @entity193 celebrates as he steers @entity420 to victory in the @entity422 - the first race of the day mingling : @entity424 was one of the more famous names to mingle with the crowds on the first day at @entity6 showing their support : a @entity193 mask gets pride of place next to two pints of @entity432 bustling : the bright sunshine brought punters flocking to @entity6 on the first day of racing action striking : the scene at @entity437 today , as action on day one of the @entity6 got underway			1
