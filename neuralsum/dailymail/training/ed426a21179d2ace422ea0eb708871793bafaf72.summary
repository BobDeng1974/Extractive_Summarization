they might not have been quite as intimidating as @entity1 but @entity2 found himself facing two more formidable opponents on his welcome to @entity5 in a @entity7 warrior and the mayor of @entity9			1
after @entity11 appeared to get cold feet on their big @entity14 date with @entity15 they were greeted more warmly here in the @entity5 capital even though the local @entity19 mayor was clearly batting for the opposition			2
@entity21 , born in @entity22 but a @entity9 resident for more than 30 years , firstly welcomed @entity11 captain ‘ @entity25 ’ and then said : ‘ do n’t be fooled by the accent – i ’m supporting @entity5 on friday			1
’ @entity11 's @entity26 of @entity11 takes part in an official @entity7 welcome in @entity9 @entity11 captain @entity29 recieves a traditional @entity7 welcome in @entity9 @entity2 accepts the @entity32 challenge during an official @entity7 @entity2 accepts the @entity32 in @entity9 ahead of @entity11 's game with co-hosts @entity5 @entity2 and the @entity11 team arrived in @entity5 ahead of their second game in the @entity38 after the ceremonial welcome @entity40 and @entity41 were greeted by a baby the slip of the tongue from the @entity46 politician followed @entity2 being met with a scary looking @entity7 challenge , which he accepted immaculately while maintaining eye contact with the warrior throughout , before @entity11 were given an official @entity50 , a traditional and far more friendly welcome			1
now all @entity2 has to do is end a run of four ducks in five innings when @entity11 face the other co-hosts , a @entity5 team who are almost as frightening as @entity15 even though they had a jittery win over @entity59			0
still , rubbing noses with a host of dignitaries in @entity5 is far more agreeable than coming face to face with opening @entity38 opponents who appear to be playing a completely different one - day game to @entity11			2
@entity67 bowls as coach @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity41 look on during an @entity11 nets @entity11 coach @entity68 talks with the team before an @entity11 nets session at @entity74 @entity26 throws the ball during an @entity11 nets session @entity11 , for now , can forget all about an @entity78 team who have beaten them four times already on this trip to extend their mastery over the old enemy that was firmly established on the @entity86 tour over a year ago			0
but life could well be just as difficult for @entity2 - not @entity25 - when they meet a @entity5 side who had a nervous encounter of their own with @entity59 in @entity91 today before winning by three wickets in a low scoring game			0
the captain is clearly discovering just how tricky leading @entity11 in a big tournament can be .			0

@entity11 arrived in @entity9 ahead of game with @entity5
local mayor *introduced* @entity11 captain as ' @entity25 ' instead of @entity2
@entity11 lost their opening @entity38 game to @entity15
