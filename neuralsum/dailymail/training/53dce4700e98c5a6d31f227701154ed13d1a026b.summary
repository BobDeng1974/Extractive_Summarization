the sun ’s magnetic field is expected to flip in the next three to four months and it could lead to changes in our climate , storms and disruption to satellites			1
this solar event only happens once every 11 years and signals what physicists call the @entity13 - a time when the @entity16 's solar activity is at its highest			1
during this peak in activity the outbursts of solar energy can increase the amount of cosmic and uv rays coming towards @entity23 and this can interfere with radio communications , cause solar bursts of light - known as flares - and can affect the planet 's temperature			1
physicists from @entity31 believe the @entity16 's magnetic fields will flip before the end of the year , reversing their polarity			1
this will cause an increase in solar energy and could lead to changes in climate and satellite disruption			1
the reversal happens once every 11 years or so during the sun 's cycle the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as @entity13 and @entity48			1
during @entity13 the amount of solar activity is at its highest due to a flip , or reversal , of the sun 's magnetic field			1
since 1976 there have been three @entity55 and they occur roughly every 11 years , although this can vary from between nine and 14 years			2
during a @entity13 , large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun 's irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by around 0.1 per cent			2
this increase in energy can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns			0
‘ it looks like we 're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal , ’ solar physicist dr @entity68 of @entity31 told @entity70			0
‘ this change will have ripple effects throughout the solar system			0
’ the sun ’s magnetic field reverses around every 11 years at the peak of each solar cycle			1
the last peak , or @entity13 , was in 2000 and @entity70 initially predicted the next flip would take place between 2011 and 2012			0
physicists also warned at the time that the next @entity13 could be the strongest yet			0
scientists at @entity31 ’s @entity86 have been studying the sun ’s magnetic field since 1976 , during which time they have witnessed three reversals			1
in 1859 a solar storm known as the @entity90 , or @entity90 after @entity91 who recorded the event , saw numerous solar flares appear all over @entity23			2
it was so strong that the @entity95 - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that @entity98 and @entity99 regions and is caused by the collision of energetic charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be have been visible as far south as @entity104			0
during @entity13 the amount of solar activity is at its highest			2
a @entity13 causes large numbers of sunspots to appear			0
the @entity16 's irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by about 0.1 per cent during this time and this can lead to changes in climate and affect radio communications in 1859 a solar storm known as the @entity90 , or @entity90 named after @entity116 who recorded it , saw numerous solar flares appear			1
from 28 august 28 to 2 september sunspots and solar flares were observed			0
@entity120 astronomer @entity91 observed the largest flare , which caused a major coronal mass ejection - a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic field - to travel directly toward @entity23			1
it was so strong that the @entity95 - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that @entity98 and @entity99 regions caused by the collision of energetic charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be have been visible as far south as @entity104			0
telegraph services were also disrupted			0
solar flares created by changes in solar activity also release x-rays and uv radiation			2
these rays can affect @entity23 's ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and disrupt long - range radio communications			1
dr @entity142 , also a solar physicist at @entity31 , explained that during a magnetic field reversal the @entity16 ’s polar magnetic fields lose strength and then stop all together before appearing again the other way around			1
the increase of solar bursts have implications for a huge area ; its influence extends billions of miles past @entity153			0
changes in the magnetic field affect what 's called the ' current sheet			1
' this sheet juts out for billions of miles from the @entity16 's equator where according to @entity163 , the star 's slowly - rotating magnetic field includes an electric current			1
although the current of electricity is small , there is a large amount flowing through a region around 10,000km thick			0
the heliosphere - a region of space and our solar system that is directly influenced by the @entity16 and its solar activity - is controlled by this sheet			2
when a magnetic field flips it causes the current sheet to become wavy , which @entity142 described to @entity163 as being like the seams on a baseball			2
as @entity23 orbits the @entity16 , the planet dips in and out of the sheet and these transitions can cause stormy space weather			0
it can also affect cosmic rays , which are particles that travel almost at light speed , and these rays can be dangerous to astronauts and space stations			0
some researchers believe these rays also directly affect how cloudy @entity23 is			0
@entity192 's @entity86 is continuing to monitor the changes and is set to release a statement when the reversal takes place .			0

the sun 's magnetic field reverses its polarity once every 11 years or so
@entity202 represents a peak in solar activity where bursts of energy are released
these bursts can lead to space storms and changes to @entity23 's climate
radio and satellite communications may also be affected
