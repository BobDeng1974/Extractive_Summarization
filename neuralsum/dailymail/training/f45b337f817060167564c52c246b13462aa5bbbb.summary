by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:57 est , 17 may 2012 updated : 12:26 est , 9 june 2012 the callousness of metal thieves has hit new depths with the theft of a memorial to two children murdered by the @entity8			1
last night the father of one of the victims expressed his ‘ utter disgust ’ at the ‘ despicable ’ crime			2
@entity14 denounced the heartless thieves who stole the plaque commemorating the 1993 @entity18 bombings , which killed his son @entity19 , 12 , and another child , three - year - old @entity21			1
the death of the two boys touched the heart of the nation and mr @entity14 received an obe for his peace campaigning after the atrocity			1
father 's anguish : @entity14 and his son on holiday , a year before @entity19 was killed at the age of 12			1
the plaque ( right ) put up in memory of @entity19 and the other victim @entity21 , 3 , has been stolen by scrap metal thieves police say the @entity40 - size plaque could have been sold for scrap for as little as £ 30			1
it is the latest in a series of abhorrent thefts of memorials by criminals exploiting the soaring value of scrap metal			0
war memorials , lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines have been targeted			0
each year , at least 15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen , worth an estimated of £ 800million			0
last night mr @entity14 – who received an obe for his active role in the @entity57 after the bombings – said : ‘ it makes me feel utter disgust and it is reprehensible that someone should disfigure what is a memorial to two young boys and see it as something they can make money from without any consideration for the families who lost loved ones			1
‘ it beggars belief that people can be so heartless and i do n’t expect that they have any conscience			1
‘ it is remarkable the lengths that some people will go to make some cash and it is one of those crimes that is so off the scale that it is disgusting			2
’ the @entity18 bombings consisted of two separate attacks – the first in february 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the @entity90 town			2
in the second attack , @entity91 received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in @entity95			0
in the event , there were two blasts , in litter bins outside @entity100 and @entity101 , within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion			0
@entity21 was killed almost instantly and @entity105 was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine			1
more than 50 other victims were injured , with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass			0
bombing victims : @entity21 , aged three , and @entity105 , 12 , who were killed in the blast in @entity18 in 1993 the bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren			1
mr @entity14 , 65 , a human resources consultant , said of the thieves : ‘ even if they are really hard up it is without any justification			1
‘ it really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters			0
‘ it leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in , in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered			2
they did not give a moments thought to the significance of what they had just stolen			0
’ his wife @entity146 , 54 , said : ‘ it ’s really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind			2
@entity19 and @entity21 had so much to live for and i wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought			1
‘ it is a sign of the times , i suppose , but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day			0
’ the bombings triggered a campaign for peace , with @entity14 and mrs @entity166 – who have two other children – working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between @entity170 and @entity171			1
they set up a @entity173 in the town and played an active role in the @entity57 , for which mr @entity14 was given his obe in 2004			1
tragically , the parents of @entity21 never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast			1
@entity21 ’s father , @entity181 , 69 , died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days			1
the boy ’s mother , @entity184 suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son ’s murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart			0
stolen : this is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the @entity8 blast was placed			1
police are today hunting for the people who took it the bronze plaque , which depicts the course of the @entity203 as it flows through the @entity18 , reads : ‘ the central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in @entity209 in 1993			1
young people helped the artist with the design work			2
’ @entity213 , @entity214 mp for @entity215 , said : ‘ this is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other @entity18 people who were injured in the bombing			0
‘ @entity18 is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it did n’t turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace			0
but these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves			0
’ @entity230 , conservative mp for @entity231 , said : ‘ i am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped			0
’ @entity233 was 22 when she and her 29 year - old fiance @entity234 were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb			0
they suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim @entity105 ’s mother , @entity146			2
yesterday mrs @entity243 , 40 , said : ‘ it ’s awful , absolutely awful and i do n’t know why someone would want to do something like that			0
it is irrelevant that it happened so long ago because the events on march 20 1993 still have an impact today			2
’ resident @entity243 , 34 , said : ‘ this is one of the most shaming crimes			0
they are nothing but sick vultures who have no respect			0
’ yesterday pc @entity259 , of @entity261 , said : ‘ this plaque forms part of a memorial and is of great significance to the town			2
’ he urged scrap metal dealers who may have information or may have been approached to buy the plaque to contact police immediately			2
blast : the scene is cordoned off after two litter bins exploded outside a @entity100 store and a @entity276 memorial : this @entity277 runs down @entity209 , @entity18 , in honour of the two boys killed in the 1993 @entity8 bomb blast campaigner : @entity14 , father of @entity18 bomb victim @entity105 , with former secretary of state for northern ireland dr @entity283			1
he is pictured at a peace centre in @entity18 he set - up after his son 's death			0
