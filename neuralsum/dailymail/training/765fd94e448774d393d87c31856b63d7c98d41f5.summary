the unusual form of protest is usually deployed against politicians who oppose gay marriage			0
after one attack mr @entity2 said : ' i 've got glitter in my hair			1
that 's not all i got in my hair			0
i glue it down every morning			0
' he was earlier left red - faced hours after his victory in the @entity20 primary when he said he 's ' not concerned about the very poor ' because they have an ' ample safety net			2
i glue it down every morning ' as the day began , the former @entity35 governor told @entity36 from @entity20 : ' i 'm not concerned about the very poor			2
we have a safety net there			0
if it needs repair , i 'll fix it			0
i 'm not concerned about the very rich			0
they 're doing just fine			0
i 'm concerned about the very heart of @entity44 , the 90 - 95 percent of @entity44 who right now are struggling			0
' ' you can focus on the very poor , that 's not my focus , ' he said			0
democrats and @entity3 alike pounced and the @entity3 front - runner 's comments as mr @entity2 quickly sought to explain his remarks			1
president @entity55 's re-election campaign was quick to criticize			0
' so much for ' we 're all in this together , ' tweeted @entity55 campaign manager @entity57			0
' no , no , no , no , no , no , no , ' @entity2 told reporters on his campaign plane when asked about the comments			2

' left holding the baby : @entity2 poses during a campaign stop in @entity72 , @entity27 on wednesday			2
the @entity3 frontrunner came under fire after saying he is ' not concerned about the very poor ' @entity75 and poor : mr @entity2 's comments will have extra resonance with his opponents as he has a personal fortune of $ 250m which may claim make him unsuited to understanding the needs of ordinary americans despite attempting to explain himself , mr @entity2 's comments quickly became an immediate distraction from his message that he 's more conservative than chief rival @entity85 and from the double - digit thumping the former @entity88 speaker sustained in @entity20			1
his campaign worked behind the scenes to provide context for the comment			0
some conservative pundits also labeled it a gaffe and said it was evidence mr @entity2 was n't prepared to run against @entity55			1
' the issue here is not that @entity2 is right or wrong , but that he is handing choice sound bites to the @entity101 to make him as unlikeable as he made @entity85 , ' said @entity102 on the conservative @entity104 blog			2
and @entity105 at the conservative @entity106 said of @entity2 : ' every time he seems to get into his groove and pull away he says things that make people think he does n't know how to play the game			2
' with criticism mounting , @entity2 flew to @entity27 and addressed a rally before heading to @entity114			2
he also boasted in flight about his ' huge ' @entity20 victory			2
victory : @entity2 addresses supporters in @entity119 after his resounding win in the @entity20 primary mr @entity2 , whose central challenge is winning over sceptical conservatives , told reporters on the plane that the fact that he performed strongly among conservatives in @entity20 made sense because he 's more conservative than @entity129			1
' i 'm not saying he 's not conservative			0
i 'm just saying he 's not the pure conservative he would have people believe , and i think folks in @entity20 saw through that , " @entity2 said			1
his campaign also started airing a radio ad in @entity138 on wednesday that says " conservatives across @entity44 are supporting @entity2			2
' but mr @entity2 was immediately was forced to clarify his comments about the poor			1
asked whether his words might strike some as odd , mr @entity2 said : ' we will hear from the @entity145 party the plight of the poor and there 's no question , it 's not good being poor , and we have a safety net to help those that are very poor			1
' mr @entity2 added that he 's more worried about the unemployed , people living on @entity154 and those struggling to send their kids to college			1
' we have a very ample safety net and we can talk about whether it needs to be strengthened or whether there are holes in it			0
but we have food stamps , we have @entity164 , we have housing vouchers , we have programs to help the poor , ' mr @entity2 said			1
" but the middle - income americans , they 're the folks that are really struggling right now			0
' optimistic : @entity85 was focusing on the future after his setback in @entity20 mr @entity2 has broached the subject of the poor repeatedly on the campaign trail but until wednesday had been more careful in his choice of words			1
' i worry about the very poor and i want to make sure that our safety net is there , ' mr @entity2 said in @entity182 in december , says the middle class are " the people i 'm really concerned about right now			1
' wednesday was n't the first time that mr @entity2 , who made millions working in private equity , has been accused of insensitivity on matters of wealth			1
he once said ' i like being able to fire people ' when talking about having the ability to choose service providers			0
he also has declared that he knew what it was like to worry about being ' pink - slipped ' out of a job			0
the gaffe will come as a bitter blow to mr @entity2 who romped home to an overwhelming victory in the @entity20 primary , re-establishing himself as the clear frontrunner in the @entity3 battle to face president @entity55 in november			1
the former @entity35 governor took a 14 - point lead on 46 per cent , with @entity85 on 32 per cent , @entity206 trailing on 13 per cent and @entity207 in fourth with seven per cent			1
in his victory speech in @entity119 , mr @entity2 congratulated his opponents on ‘ another hard - fought contest ’ and said that ‘ the three gentlemen left are serious and able competitors ’			1
third place : @entity206 , who gave up on @entity20 days ago , has been campaigning in @entity138 but his main target was mr @entity55			1
he launched a blistering attack on the president and promised to ' end the @entity55 era and begin a new era of @entity44 prosperity ' after years of economic decline			0
' mr president , you were elected to lead , you chose to follow , and now it 's time to get out of the way			0
’ he added : ‘ three years ago this week , a newly elected president @entity55 faced the @entity44 people and said that if he could n’t turn the economy around in three years , he ’d be looking at a one - term proposition , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’re here to collect			0
’ the drubbing of mr @entity85 , the shock victor in @entity232 10 days ago , will put pressure on him to abandon his @entity88 bid but the former house speaker shows no sign of giving up yet			0
@entity2 - 46 % ( 771,842 votes ) @entity85 - 32 % ( 531 , 294 ) @entity206 - 13 % ( 222,248 ) @entity207 - 7 % ( 116,776 ) mr @entity85 was surrounded by volunteers holding ‘ 46 states to go ’ signs as he delivered a defiant address in @entity242			1
he did not mention mr @entity2 by name and barely acknowledged he had lost as he vowed : ‘ we are going to contest every place and we are going to win and we are going to be in @entity119 as the nominee in august			1
’ in a rallying cry for conservatives to unite behind him , he said : ‘ it is now clear that this will be a two - person race between the conservative leader @entity85 and the @entity35 moderate , and the voters of @entity20 really made that clear , ’ he pledged to ‘ have people power beat money power in the next six months ’			2
mr @entity85 ’s second place showing , clearly ahead of mr @entity206 , the @entity256 victor , and maverick libertarian congressman mr @entity207 , will bolster his case that he is the only conservative alternative to mr @entity2			1
mr @entity85 has already called for mr @entity206 to pull out and endorse him			2
mr @entity2 ’s @entity20 victory gives him all 50 of the state ’s convention delegates			1
his advisers were exultant at registering a landslide margin greater than the 13 per cent achieved by mr @entity85 in @entity232			2
given that mr @entity85 led in the polls after @entity232 , the @entity2 campaign hopes that the win in @entity20 , where mr @entity2 lost to @entity267 in the 2008 primary , will cement their message that he is now almost invincible			1
after the four successive contests in @entity256 , @entity182 , @entity232 and @entity20 , the @entity3 race now becomes a much more national affair – a significant advantage for the richer and better - organised mr @entity2 , the long - time party establishment choice			1
trailing : @entity207 has also concentrated his efforts in other states			0

comments came after @entity2 won in @entity20 with nearly half the votes
took 46 % , with @entity129 on 32 % , @entity206 on 13 % and @entity207 on 7 %
democrats and @entity3 opponents immediately attacked mr @entity2
