@entity0 booted six goals from six attempts and turned in a powerhouse display in the pack to dent @entity9 's hopes of the @entity15			1
@entity16 crossed for two of the @entity4 tries with @entity18 grabbing the other on a night @entity9 will want to forget			1
best foot forward : @entity0 celebrates with teammates after kicking @entity4 to a 24 - 10 victory over @entity9 @entity9 , who swamped @entity4 48 - 4 at the @entity24 in june , went into the clash with only one win in their last three games against @entity28 after a shock loss to @entity30 and a draw at @entity32 but the eighth placed @entity4 had also won only three of their last 12 @entity35 matches and were looking nervously over their shoulders in the battle for the final play off spot			1
@entity9 , who had lost only one of the previous 11 meetings with @entity4 , welcomed back @entity42 and @entity43 from long term injuries alongside recent absentees @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 but @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 were missing			2
@entity4 skipper @entity52 , who retires at the end of the season , made his last home appearance with the @entity4 ' last two matches away at @entity30 and @entity28			0
@entity4 made a fine start with only a flying @entity58 tackle preventing a @entity59 try			0
but the @entity4 won the scrum against the head for @entity63 's long pass to put @entity16 over in the corner and @entity0 landed the conversion before slotting over a penalty			1
@entity9 were still recovering when @entity52 's burst allowed @entity68 and @entity63 to combine and send @entity18 racing in at the opposite corner			2
@entity70 added the touchline conversion to make it 14 - 0 after 14 minutes			0
it would have been more embarrassing for @entity9 had @entity16 been able to take a difficult pass from @entity74 with the line at his mercy			2
@entity9 's opening try had an element of luck about it with a @entity81 pass rolling along the ground before @entity43 put @entity83 over after 30 minutes			0
@entity81 was more accurate with a teasing kick to the corner for @entity86 to outjump @entity16 and touch down - and this time @entity87 was successful with the kick to cut the gap to 14 - 10			2
only desperate defence prevented @entity86 bagging a second try just before the break but @entity4 deserved their half - time advantage although the warning signs were evident			0
@entity4 made a perfect start to the second half with @entity16 going over for his second try after @entity9 were caught napping from a kick with @entity0 's fourth goal making it 20 - 10			1
the torrential rain made handling difficult , especially for @entity9 , with @entity102 lucky to escape with only a yellow card for a high and late tackle on @entity68			0
@entity0 struck two penalties to extend the advantage to 24 - 10 on the hour			1
@entity4 looked hungrier than @entity9 who can have no complaints at the final scoreline			0
