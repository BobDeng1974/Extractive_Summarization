by @entity0 last updated at 12:30 am on 8th january 2012 it looks like the kind of home owned by a successful businessman or influential politician			1
but this imposing five - bedroom house , in one of the most affluent districts of @entity9 , @entity10 , is understood to be owned by a man being investigated for benefit fraud in @entity13 and @entity14			1
the opulent two - storey home , worth up to £ 300,000 in the country ’s second - biggest city , is the subject of an investigation by the @entity20 and @entity14 authorities into @entity22			1
imposing : the £ 300,000 @entity9 house , in one of the most affluent districts in @entity9 , owned by @entity22 investigators want to know how the father of three , who has allegedly claimed nearly £ 292,000 of benefits in both @entity13 and @entity14 during the past decade , could afford to keep such a property			1
his @entity10 address was included in a file given to the @entity20 by the @entity14 authorities following a tip - off that he did not live in @entity14 but had been receiving state support since 2002			1
mr @entity22 has allegedly been paid huge sums after saying he was disabled and could barely walk , while claiming to live in both countries			0
but his neighbours in @entity10 say he is regularly seen strolling round the upper - class neighbourhood of @entity40 and that he often spends several months at a time at the house to escape the cold @entity43 winters			1
last week , this newspaper revealed he has received up to £ 110,000 in housing benefit from the @entity13 taxpayer since 1997			1
he has also been paid up to £ 70,000 in disability allowance in the past decade , while banking about £ 112,000 of benefits in @entity14			1
under investigation : @entity22 , pictured at his home in @entity51 locals in @entity9 told how mr @entity22 , 58 , who lives in a taxpayer - funded three - bedroom terrace house in @entity51 , @entity54 , bought land for the house in the early nineties			1
in the years that followed , he turned it into one of the smartest homes in this tree - lined street , five miles from @entity9			2
when @entity64 first visited the property last week , mr @entity22 ’s name , and that of his wife @entity67 , 58 , were painted in @entity68 on a stone plaque outside the house			0
but when we returned the following day , after making our initial enquiries , the plaque had been reduced to a pile of rubble on the ground			0
only the name @entity78 , believed to be mr @entity22 ’s brother , remained on the entrance to the house			0
after identifying a photograph of mr @entity22 , one neighbour , who asked not to be named , said : ‘ i often see @entity22 around the area			0
he is a good man and always stops to talk about his family and life in general			2
‘ he is a regular at the local mosque and spends most of his time there if he is not at home watching tv or walking in the park with his family			2
‘ he was here in the spring last year , but i have n’t seen him for a while			0
he usually likes to come in the @entity43 winter as well because he says the weather is so bad he can not stand it			0
’ local men at the mosque , less than 500 yards from his front door , said mr @entity22 has often spent many hours chatting to friends and praying			0
one said : ‘ @entity22 is a good man with a very good family			2
he is always smartly dressed in traditional clothes and gives generously to the mosque			0
’ some locals who claimed to know mr @entity22 said they believed he owned the house with his brother , who is also a regular visitor			2
when members of the @entity22 family are staying at the house they have up to four staff , including a cook , a driver and a gardener			0
other @entity40 residents include bankers , judges and senior government workers and almost all of the houses in the area are gated , many with armed guards outside the high - walled homes			2
the smart self - contained town is a world away from the bustling markets and shanty towns nearby			2
the family has a cook , driver and gardener most blocks have their own mosques at the end of the road and two former prime ministers , @entity134 and @entity135 , have also kept homes in the area			0
a man who was at the house last thursday when a @entity64 reporter called said he lived there with his wife and daughter and that they were responsible for looking after the house and the @entity22 family when they were in @entity10			1
he said : ‘ @entity22 was supposed to come in november last year , but he did n’t for some reason			0
‘ he usually spends the winters here , sometimes for a few weeks at a time , but i do n’t know when he will be back			0
’ mr @entity22 , originally from @entity10 , faces up to seven years in jail in @entity13 if he is found guilty of misleading social services to claim state support			1
he could also face charges of fraud in @entity14			1
it is alleged he was paid incapacity benefit in @entity13 from 1999 to 2002 , totalling £ 4,900 a year , and also banked an estimated £ 112,000 of benefits in @entity14 since 2002			1
mr @entity22 , seen earlier this month strolling to the bank and a branch of @entity161 near his @entity51 house , has also received up to £ 2,700 a year of income support in @entity13 since 2002 and as much as £ 5,000 a year in disability living allowance since 2005			1

it is believed mr @entity22 may have also rented out his taxpayer - funded , three - bedroom apartment in @entity170 while he has not lived there , netting up to an extra £ 800 a month			0
a @entity20 source in @entity13 said : ‘ investigators will certainly want to know how mr @entity22 has been able to afford to keep such a large house in @entity10 with no income other than his benefits			1
this will all form part of any case against him			0
’ on friday , a new paper - shredder was delivered to mr @entity22 ’s home in @entity51			1
however , when @entity64 knocked at the door , there was initially no answer			0
after five minutes a man opened the door and asked our reporter who he represented			0
when details of the house in @entity9 were put to him , he said the family had made a complaint to the @entity196 and were advised not to talk to reporters			0
asked if mr @entity22 was at home , the man refused to answer .			2
