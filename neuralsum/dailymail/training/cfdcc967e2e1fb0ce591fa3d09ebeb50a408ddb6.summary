by @entity1 reporter published : 13:20 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 13:43 est , 26 march 2012 these are the eery family portraits of unknowns found strewn amongst the carnage of @entity6 's @entity5			1
emergency services salvaged over 750,000 images in @entity9 and returned most of them to their owners as they helped clear up the aftermath of the deadly natural disaster			1
but over 30,000 were damaged beyond recognition , with the incumbents ' faces often spookily washed away by the millions of tonnes of water that spilled onto the land			2
this is one of the rather spooky family portraits washed up on shore after @entity6 's tsunami of the 750,000 images found in @entity9 , over 30,000 were damaged beyond recognition emergency services salvaged over 750,000 images in @entity9 and returned most of them to their owners , this is one of the unlucky ones dozens of snaps show people in happier times - smiling , playing , laughing - but crucially their identities have been lost to the devastating effects of the water			1
holiday snaps , weddings , baby births and children 's birthdays - all documented in the striking series of images found discarded about the coastal town at the heart of the disaster zone			2
in one poignant image a suburban street , completely obliterated by the surging tides , can be seen before the diaster - but with the middle water damaged leaving a simply white space			1
volunteer group salvage memory decided to take ownership of the images and turn them into a permanent memorial to the victims			2
the missing images now form an exhibition currently showing in @entity61 professional photographer , @entity62 , has taken it upon himself to photograph the 30,000 untraceable snaps			2
the exhibition hopes to reunite the photographs to their original owners @entity67 , who was luckily in @entity68 when the disaster occurred , said : ' they stir up and sear people 's imagination because of the water damage			2
' although the faces are mostly unrecognisable , you can tell that they capture happy moments			2
' the disaster affected everyone			2
most of the victims are just statistics which lessen the feelings towards them			0
' but these photos make viewers think of them and remember them on a more personal level , and hope they survived the disaster			0
someone 's holiday snaps of skyscapers form part of the exhibition this person 's face has been completely obscured by the water damage from the tsunami volunteers numbering nearly 500 are still helping authorities sieve through the bundles of images rescued - and are using social media to help trace those seen in them			0
@entity67 added : ' one of our volunteers is actually from @entity9 where all the images were recovered from			0
' he was thankfully out of town on a business trip and his house was too badly affected by the tsunami			0
but the earthquake that followed partially destroyed it			0
' his wife and five - year - old daughter evacuated from their town up north to @entity120			0
he is still faced with living away from his family			0
one lucky man was reunited with an old photo , thanks to it being on display at the exhibition the images were found discarded about the coastal town at the heart of the disaster zone he , alongside the other volunteers , have created an exhibit to display the poignant photos and are using the money raised to help support victims in @entity9			0
the exhibit will be on display in @entity61 between april 2 and april 27			0
' it is also very strange for him as he knew lots of the people in the images , but did n't know if they were alive or safe and well			0
' professional photographer , @entity62 , has taken it upon himself to photograph the 30,000 untraceable snaps			0
another @entity6 nuclear reactor was taken off line for maintenance on monday , leaving the country with only one of its 54 reactors operational following last year 's devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
the last reactor is expected to be shut down by early may , raising the possibility of power shortages across the nation as demand increases in the hot summer @entity164 reactor at the @entity167 complex was taken off line early monday by the @entity168 the utility also runs the plant in @entity171 , northeast of @entity68 , that suffered meltdowns , explosions and radiation leaks after the march 11 quake and @entity177 reactors are taken off line every 13 months for regular checks			1
with concerns over nuclear safety high following the @entity171 crisis , none of the reactors that have been shut down for checks , and none that were already off line at the time of the disaster , have been allowed to restart			1
the last reactor , on the northern island of @entity189 , will be shut down in may			1
the timing for when any reactors will be restarted remains unclear			0
before the crisis , @entity6 depended on nuclear power for one - third of its electricity			1
@entity6 's government wants to restart reactors as soon as ' stress tests ' prove they are safe , but faces strong public opposition			1
local leaders , fearing a political backlash , are reluctant to give their @entity201 have required all reactors to undergo the stress tests and make necessary modifications to improve safety			0
the stress tests , similar to those used in @entity207 and elsewhere in @entity208 , are designed to assess how well the plants can withstand earthquakes , tsunamis , storms , loss of power and other crises			1
prime minister @entity216 has promised to reduce @entity6 's reliance on nuclear power over time and plans to lay out a new energy policy by the summer			1
in the meantime , @entity6 has temporarily turned to oil and coal generation plants to make up for the shortfall , and businesses have been required to reduce electricity use to help with conservation efforts .			1

another nuclear reactor taken *offline* today , leaving only one power station left working in @entity6
