warned : prime minister @entity0 has been told sending arms to @entity3 rebels could see them end up in the hands of @entity6 terrorists who target the @entity7 @entity0 has been warned against sending arms to @entity3 rebels amid fears they would end up in the hands of @entity6 terrorists who target the @entity7			2
up to 3,000 surface - to - air missiles have gone missing in @entity11 since the conflict - and spy chiefs say the state has become the ' @entity15 ' of the world 's illegal arms trade			1
more than one million tonnes of weapons belonging to @entity19 were looted from arms dumps after the dictator was toppled in october 2011			1
@entity23 agents fear large numbers of weapons - which included 22,000 shoulder - launched missiles capable of bringing down an aircraft - have been smuggled out of @entity11 to groups linked to @entity29			1
security sources are said to fear that , if the rebels fighting tyrant @entity34 's regime in @entity3 are armed by the @entity7 , a similar situation could arise there - with the weapons falling into the hands of @entity40 extremists in the country			2
it is understood @entity23 estimates there are now more weapons in @entity11 than the entire arsenal of the @entity46 â€” and much of it is unsecured			1
the @entity11 government remains in a precarious position , with large parts of the army dominated by local militias			1
there were thought to be 22,000 shoulder - launched anti-aircraft missiles , known as manpads , at the time of @entity19 's death in october 2011			1
and although the majority are believed to have been destroyed @entity23 estimates about 3,000 are still unaccounted for			2
just one such missile could bring down a civilian airliner if it fell into the wrong hands			0
as well as the security services , several military figures have deep reservations about any plans to arm the rebels in @entity3			0
general sir @entity66 , the former head of the army , yesterday said he was ' very much in the camp of those who would not wish to be involved and intervene in any shape or form			0
' major general @entity72 , who commanded @entity74 forces in the @entity75 in 1982 , said it was ' absolutely ridiculous ' to contemplate another intervention at a time when troop numbers were being cut			0
ministers will confirm tomorrow another 5,000 @entity46 personnel will lose their jobs			0
' people will think it is absolutely ridiculous , ' said maj gen @entity72			0
' the thought of getting involved with something else before we finish what we are trying to do in @entity89 would certainly not be good for morale			0
' more than one million tonnes of weapons belonging to @entity19 were looted from arms dumps after the dictator was toppled in october 2011 mr @entity0 is in a precarious position because he is keen to support @entity96 president @entity95			1
@entity96 plans to channel small arms to the rebels but has no immediate intention of seeking international agreement to impose a no - fly zone			2
but the dangers of this became starker yesterday @entity104 when an internet video showed a stockpile of surface - to - air missiles had fallen into the hands of jihadists fighting in @entity3			1
the film shows a stash of at least 30 @entity114 - era @entity113 heat - seeking missiles - the most advanced anti-aircraft weapons yet seen with in the clutches of the @entity40			2
known as the ' needle ' , @entity119 - 16 missiles can hit aircraft flying at 11,000ft			2
they would be particularly dangerous if used for attacks from airport perimeters			0
military experts are concerned that arms supplied to @entity3 rebels would find their way to fanatics who would then use them to target @entity74			0
@entity130 , an analyst at @entity131 and @entity132 , said : ' if the @entity7 ever did provide weapons to the moderate insurgency , there is still a high chance weapons will cross between different groups and almost invariably end up in the hands of groups like this			0
' meanwhile , mr @entity0 has been warned that @entity74 would suffer ' unacceptable ' casualties in a war with @entity3			0
sources said the @entity145 risked losing up to 50 per cent of fighter jets deployed to enforce a no - fly zone because of @entity3 's extensive air defence system , which is based around infra - red guided missiles			1
one well - placed insider said : ' it has been stressed to the prime minister that attacking @entity3 would not be the same as attacking @entity11			1

up to 3,000 surface - to - air missiles went missing in @entity11
it happened after @entity19 was toppled in october 2011
