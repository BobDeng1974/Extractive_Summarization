by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:17 est , 20 april 2013 updated : 17:17 est , 20 april 2013 @entity3 ’s former chief of staff flew 3,000 miles to an oil - rich former @entity5 state run by a brutal dictator to tell them how they could learn from @entity11 ’s long history of democracy			1
@entity13 started out by explaining how @entity14 would be a vastly better country if it could have its own @entity18 - class @entity17 civil service system , free of corruption			1
but he ended up reopening an old domestic feud by launching a personal attack on a fellow former @entity11 mandarin who compared mr @entity3 ’s new @entity25 government to @entity27 ’s @entity26			1
feud : @entity13 , left , reopened an old domestic feud by launching a personal attack on former @entity11 mandarin sir @entity31 , right , who compared mr @entity3 ’s @entity25 government to @entity27 ’s @entity26 after complaining how hard it was to get rid of troublesome civil servants in @entity11 , mr @entity13 said the government was forced to give a £ 1 million payoff to the official who was ‘ to blame for the mad cow disease ’ crisis in the early days of mr @entity3 ’s @entity38			1
he did not name the official , but he did n’t have to : sir @entity31 , permanent secretary at the @entity43 in the @entity44 , last night said he had no doubt mr @entity13 was referring to him			1
mr @entity13 , along with mr @entity3 , has been advising @entity14 president @entity46 in a deal reportedly worth up to £ 16 million			1
@entity14 has faced widespread concern over human rights abuses , the treatment of the president ’s political opponents and brutality and murder by its police force			1
its civil service is riddled with corruption and nepotism			2
speaking at @entity46 ’s @entity59 , mr @entity13 told his audience of the dictator ’s apparatchiks : ‘ when we came to power in 1997 , there was a high - ranking official in the @entity67 who was fully accountable for the outbreak of mad cow disease in the country			2
’ aide : @entity13 is pictured with @entity3 in 2007 according to a @entity14 news agency , mr @entity13 said : ‘ nothing happened when we asked him to resign			1
we were told it was impossible to fire him and the best option was to promote him off this position			0
' in the end , we had to pay him £ 1 million worth of termination fee			0
it is very difficult to get rid of such unwanted officials			0
’ sir @entity31 told @entity83 : ‘ i have come across reports of @entity13 bad - mouthing me before			1
it is something he has got in his head for some reason , i do n’t know why			0
i might have spoken to him twice			0
‘ it all seems very strange and is also quite factually wrong			0
he seems to be accusing me of being responsible for @entity90			0
i do n’t see how anyone who knew anything , which does n’t include @entity13 , could say that			2
the @entity90 report says something completely different			0
mr @entity13 should check his facts			2
’ after leaving his @entity17 job , sir @entity31 was fiercely critical of the @entity3 government			1
he told the @entity100 : ‘ in one respect			0
[ the @entity3 government ] reminded me of the @entity26 where			1
nobody would know where ultimate responsibility lay			0
’ last night , sir @entity31 denied having received a £ 1 million payoff , saying : ‘ it depends how you add it up			1
i was there for more than 30 years ( and ) you can make up a very big figure with pensions and what have you			0
‘ the implication of the £ 1 million is that i was paid over and above what i was entitled to			0
it was fully within the rules			0
once again , @entity13 ’s rhetoric is completely at variance with the facts			2
’ mr @entity13 was unavailable for comment .			2

@entity13 gave speech in oil rich former @entity5 state @entity14
but he launched personal attack on sir @entity31
he *previously* compared @entity3 ’s government to @entity27 ’s @entity26
