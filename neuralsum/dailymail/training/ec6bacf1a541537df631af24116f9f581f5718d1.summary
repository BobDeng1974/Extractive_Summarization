you 'd think prince @entity1 would go easy on the politically incorrect jokes when opening a new cardiac centre			1
after all , it was just over a year ago that the 91 - year - old @entity5 had heart surgery after suffering chest pains			2
but the outspoken @entity1 proved he ’s incorrigible at @entity8 , telling a @entity10 nurse : ‘ the @entity11 must be half - empty – you ’re all here running the @entity14			1
’ royal quip : the @entity1 told this @entity11 nurse at @entity8 her country must be ' half empty ' , because so many of her compatriots have come to the @entity18 to work for the @entity14 are there any of you left ? the 91 - year - old joked with the @entity11 nurse and her colleagues during a visit to @entity8 and @entity25 to open a new cardiac centre earlier today the @entity1 made his remark as he opened a £ 5.5million facility on tuesday			1
the nurse seemed to take his joke in good humour and laughed			2
the 91 - year - old royal , who calls himself ' the world 's most experienced curtain puller ' , asked when the hospital would get a helipad to save him a journey by car			2
he had apparently been keen to visit after undergoing heart surgery himself just over a year ago			0
as he visited the new cardiac centre , the @entity1 was presented with a gold plated coronary arterial stent - similar to the one used during his own surgery			1
‘ @entity49 - a spare , just in case ! , ’ the smiling @entity1 quipped , before attempting to perform the procedure himself using the equipment on the new wing			1
@entity52 said last night that it would not comment on a ' private conversation '			2
royal sources insisted , however , that the prince would never intend to cause offence and liked to make the odd joke ' to put people at ease '			0
happy greeting : prince @entity1 shakes the hand of the @entity10 nurse as he makes her giggle with his joke on good form : the @entity1 was in a ' jovial ' mood and joked about the hospital installing a helipad to save him the car journey royal opening : the @entity1 visited the hospital to unveil a £ 5.5million cardiac centre ' it was a very jovial visit , with lots of laughing all round			1
the @entity1 was on very good form , ' they said			1
the hospital spokesperson added : ' staff greatly enjoyed the opportunity to meet the @entity1			1
we regard all conversations he had with our staff and guests as private and therefore would not comment on them			1
' @entity8 is a very cosmopolitan town and the working staff at @entity8 and @entity89 reflects that			1
' the latest figures suggest that 16,184 of the 670,000 nurses in the @entity18 are from the @entity11 – which has a population of 94.8million			1
viewed by some as ' refreshingly open ' but by others as somewhat politically incorrect , prince @entity1 has always possessed a propensity to shock			2
last year the @entity1 followed tradition as he walked past a pretty young woman in red and exclaimed ' i would get arrested if i unzipped that dress ! ’ prince @entity102 and the @entity103 were on a royal visit to @entity105 , @entity106 , when he spotted 25 - year - old @entity107 , turned to the policeman standing next to her and gestured towards her eye - catching zip - up dress			2
' do you still throw spears at each other ? ' : the @entity1 talks to @entity114 performers after watching a culture show at @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 lady in red : as he walked past @entity122 worker @entity107 , 25 , prince @entity1 turned to a police officer and said : ' i would get arrested if i unzipped that dress ! ' gaffe - prone : the queen with the @entity1 on a visit to @entity129 in @entity130 in 2010 former @entity133 @entity132 leader @entity131 ( left ) was asked by the @entity1 if she wore tartan knickers at a papal reception in 2009			1
and the prince was in a spot of bother again in 2001 after telling a 13 - year - old @entity138 ( right ) he would need to lose weight if he wanted to be an astronaut in 1986 he told @entity18 students in @entity142 : ' if you stay here much longer you 'll all be slitty - eyed			0
' seven years later , he told a @entity146 living in @entity147 : ' you ca n't have been here long			0
you 've not got a pot belly			0
' his remarks apparently alluded to the @entity147 ' love of food and drink			0
closer to home , he caused a storm while touring a factory in @entity157 in august 1999 when he remarked that a fuse box ' looked as though it had been put in by an @entity159 '			0
again in @entity133 , he outraged locals when he asked a driving instructor he met on a walkabout in @entity163 in 1995 : ' how do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them past the test ? '			0
his other foot - in - mouth remarks include telling a group of teenagers from the @entity170 in @entity171 who were standing near a loud @entity174 steel band : ' if you 're near that music it 's no wonder you 're deaf			0
' on february 11 , the @entity1 attended sunday morning church service at @entity178 , @entity179 , and left this policeman chuckling with an off - the - cuff comment that was not reported some of his off - the - cuff remarks have proved more amusing , however			1
when asked if he knew the @entity185 , off the coast of @entity187 , he joked : ' yes , my son owns them			0
' and of his daughter , @entity191 , he jested : ' if it does n't fart or eat hay , she is not interested			0
' @entity195 author of prince @entity1 : @entity196 and @entity197 said : ' this is a classic prince @entity1 comment			1
i have no doubt that he does n't mean to offend and the nurse took no offence			0
he makes these comments to break the ice and put people at ease			0
' that said , there is no doubt that sometimes he does overstep the mark and people are genuinely taken aback or upset by his comments			0
' mr @entity195 pointed out that when the prince asked an islander in the @entity216 during a 1994 visit : ' are n't most of you descended from pirates ? ' , the man appeared to be genuinely offended			0
the @entity1 is well - known for his outspoken comments , here are some of his most memorable :			2

@entity1 was visiting @entity8 and @entity224 , @entity225
he made hospital worker from the @entity11 laugh with his comment
hospital says : ' staff greatly enjoyed the opportunity to meet the @entity1 . '
