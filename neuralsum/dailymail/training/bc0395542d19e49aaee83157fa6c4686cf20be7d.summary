@entity2 ’s clique of millionaire advisors are acting like a ‘ @entity4 ’ stopping @entity5 connecting with ordinary voters , backbench mps have warned			1
the @entity5 leader is facing mounting criticism over his sacking of shadow minister @entity10 over her ‘ snobby ’ tweet of a family home draped in @entity14 flags last week			1
former welfare minister @entity15 said the incident was ‘ the most serious thing that has happened ’ to @entity5 - ‘ because it gives vent to what everybody ’s guts are telling them about us ’			1
@entity5 shadow cabinet minister @entity22 added that the gaffe had harmed @entity5 's chances of winning the next election			1
' it came after mr @entity15 accused the @entity5 leader of surrounding himself with a clique of wealthy out - of - touch aides and @entity34 who did not understand ordinary workers			1
he said : ‘ it ’s the north @entity28 set we ’ve got to control			1
they are a @entity4 trying to prevent us reaching out to our voters and like the @entity4 they ’ve got to be demolished			0
' mr @entity15 added : ‘ @entity2 ’s trying to move us on immigration and welfare and with one blast of a tweet she wrecks that and puts us back to square one			1
the real problem we have is that there ’s a whole group of them			0
’ his remarks came as fellow @entity5 mp @entity61 - who grew up on a council estate close to @entity64 's infamous @entity63 – said the party had ‘ lost touch ’ with ordinary voters			1
he said : ‘ @entity69 and large , modern @entity5 politicians come from liberal , professional backgrounds			2
@entity72 mp @entity71 also appeared to take a swipe at the @entity5 leader this morning			1
on your bike : the @entity5 mp cycling away from her home last week after being ordered by @entity2 to resign from the shadow cabinet the @entity5 frontbencher defended posting the image , claiming she had never seen anything like it white van man @entity83 arrived home at his house in @entity86 after travelling to @entity28 to confront @entity5 mp @entity10 appearing on the @entity89 show , she said politicians ‘ entering politics without having a job outside made it hard for mps to connect with the public ’			1
she said : ‘ alienation from the mainstream political class is huge			0
and it 's not about who we are , it 's about our experiences			0
‘ so coming into @entity101 without having done anything outside politics is not a good route to connecting with people			0
‘ and then it 's all about how we do our politics , and i think too often we set the political agenda from @entity111 and we go to our constituencies and then pronounce			2
’ the @entity72 mp said there were a number of @entity14 flags on houses in her constituency and they often expressed support for the @entity14 football team			1
‘ what the @entity14 flags are all about are a number of , first of all they are about football and do n't forget that			1
and the other thing is we 've recaptured the @entity14 flag			2
the @entity14 flag has an important tradition in the past but we may have to make it relevent to the present and the future			2
’ but former @entity5 minister @entity132 said mr @entity2 had ‘ made a mistake ’ in sacking @entity134 and @entity135 mp mrs @entity10			1
@entity5 's former welfare minister @entity15 attacked @entity5 's north @entity28 elite ‘ @entity10 is not a snob , she does n't look down on council tenants , ’ she told @entity140 ' @entity139 programme			1
‘ she could n't hold her seat - which is quite a marginal one - if she did n't do a lot of work with council tenants			0
she has probably knocked on more council estate doors than many of her critics			0
‘ what people do n't know is that @entity10 was tweeting all day from @entity86			2
she saw it as reportage			0
’ she added : ‘ i think he made a mistake sacking her because apart from anything else it implied she had said something about the man 's house , which she had n't			2
‘ but more important i think it made it a bigger story than it otherwise would have been			0
’ however , mr @entity2 ’s decision to sack ms @entity10 was backed by shadow work and pensions secretary @entity22			1
she ms @entity10 ’s controversial tweet of a house in @entity86 adorned with @entity14 flags was ‘ condescending and disrespectful ’			1
‘ i was out on the doorstep on thursday when i saw that tweet			0
i was up in @entity174 and i saw it and i thought – what is she trying to say ? ‘ because actually when i knock on doors in my constituency and around the country a lot of people work incredibly hard for themselves , running their own businesses , patriotic people who care and love their country			0
‘ and i thought @entity10 was being condescending and disrespectful of the people actually that i went into politics to serve			2
‘ so , i think it was right that that she went			0
what she was suggesting does n’t represent the values of the @entity5 , the ethos and values of the @entity5			2
‘ @entity2 was incredibly angry … and i was angry when i saw it , because i am working hard , as are other @entity34 and activists around the country , trying to get a @entity5 government back in six months time and she set that process back			1
‘ so , he was angry , @entity5 activists and mps were angry			0
and i think it is right that she has gone			0
’ ms @entity22 dismissed comments by @entity5 mp @entity61 suggesting that the party is ‘ culturally adrift ’ from the working classes			1
‘ well , i just do n’t think that is true at all			0
if you look at recent by - election results , @entity215 and @entity216 for example , we held that seat			0
‘ the @entity219 in very difficult circumstances for @entity5 , we held that - both traditional @entity5 areas			0
and if you look at the polling in some of the key seats that we need to win back in five and a half / six months time we are ahead there as well			0
’ ms @entity22 admitted that @entity5 should have done more on immigration when they were in government			2
‘ in retrospect we should n’t have opened the doors as quickly , so i would go further , not just that we should have made these welfare changes earlier , but we should have had longer transitional controls so we did n’t have the inflows that we had in the 2000s			0
’ @entity10 ’s @entity134 home is at the heart of the liberal elite ’s dinner party circuit			0
directly next door is @entity71 , who is expected to seek @entity5 ’s nomination to be the next @entity28 mayor			2
ms @entity10 's home is a vast , four - storey @entity244 townhouse in an area beloved of lawyers and bankers , where a similar property changed hands earlier this year for £ 2.9 million - £ 900,000 above the threshold for @entity5 ’s planned ‘ soak - the - rich ’ mansion tax			1
@entity71 ’s likely rival , @entity253 , lives a couple of miles north			0
if ms @entity10 ever needs to consult @entity257 , one of @entity2 ’s key advisers , he is only a short stroll away			2
mr @entity2 can be found two miles away in a £ 2.6million townhouse , not far from his staunch supporter and former @entity5 leader @entity261			1
notorious number 10 spin doctor @entity262 has himself a £ 2million property within walking distance , while @entity2 ’s adviser @entity265 is not far away either			0
others nearby include @entity2 ’s brother @entity61 , @entity267 , shadow education secretary @entity268 and shadow chancellor @entity269			2
ms @entity10 shares her home with @entity271 educated lawyer husband sir @entity272 , a barrister at @entity273 whose specialities included the lucrative field of off - shore trusts ( which , among other things , help rich people avoid taxes )			0
the pair bought the property in 1993 , two years after they married , and moved in during the same week as another great @entity284 power couple , @entity285 and @entity286			0
ms @entity10 , a close @entity2 ally and one of the first to back him as leader in his battle against brother @entity61 , stepped down from her post as shadow attorney general two days ago			1
the resignation came after she was confronted by a ' furious ' @entity2 following her tweet of a house in @entity86 flying three @entity14 flags from the upstairs windows , with a white van parked in the driveway			1
she was branded a snob and attacked for her subsequent comments to @entity302 that she had ' never seen anything like it ' , after which she protested that she had become a victim of @entity308 prejudice			0
@entity309 , the owner of the house which is worth £ 119,000 , has insisted that ms @entity10 apologise to him over her remarks , but she has so far ducked any meeting with him			2
the comments have caused a meltdown in the upper echelons of the @entity5 , with one mp branding the gaffe ' horrendous , while others turned on mr @entity2 , saying his reaction had been hasty and ill thought - out			1
where the other half live : @entity10 and her @entity324 husband moved into the elite neighbourhood at the same time as @entity285 and @entity286 labour strategists had hoped a @entity328 landslide in @entity86 would mark the moment that pressure switched on to mr @entity331 and away from mr @entity2 , who has endured weeks of speculation about his leadership			1
but with @entity328 ’s win narrower than expected , a result likely to deter further potential defectors who want to keep their commons seats after next may ’ s election , there was little sign of @entity342 disunity			0
instead , @entity5 was riven over whether mr @entity2 ’s treatment of @entity344 had been over the top and how it should counter the threat to its working - class vote from @entity328 .			1

@entity5 leader facing mounting *fallout* over sacking of mp over flag tweet
@entity10 posted an image of a house covered in @entity14 flags
ex minister @entity15 says it exposed @entity5 's problem with voters
he claimed mr @entity2 and his ' north @entity28 set ' were harming @entity5
@entity22 said it had harmed @entity5 's chances of winning election
comes as @entity28 mp @entity61 admits @entity5 losing core support
but @entity132 said @entity2 's decision to sack her had been a ' mistake '
