but when the @entity6 joined a group of inner city schoolchildren on a camping trip , there was only one thing they wanted to know : just what was it like to be a real princess ? as the group explored the woods and chatted around a bonfire , it fell to @entity18 to bravely ask the question they all wanted to know the answer to			1
‘ we asked how it felt to be a princess and she said it was very nice , ’ the eight - year - old girl said afterwards			1
campfire chinwag : when asked what it was like to be a princess by eight - year - old @entity18 during a visit to a camping trip in @entity33 , the @entity6 replied it was ' very nice ' ‘ she said she got to visit lots of countries but had n’t seen as many as @entity37			1
she said @entity37 was very sweet and kind and spoiled her			1
’ she added later that @entity6 had been had been ‘ lovely and very , very pretty			2
’ @entity39 had joined the children visiting an outdoor bounds - style scheme at the @entity44 @entity43 in @entity45 , @entity33			1
the trip was organised by @entity47 to give children from deprived backgrounds the opportunity to venture into the countryside and develop their confidence and teamwork skills			1
the charitable @entity54 is supporting @entity47 in its work and last year @entity37 and @entity6 attended a glitzy fundraising gala in @entity57 , their first engagement as a married couple			1
revealing : @entity6 also told the youngster that she got to visit lots of countries but had n't seen as many as @entity37 and that @entity37 was very sweet and kind and spoiled her on that occasion the @entity6 wore a glittering rose @entity65 gown and sipped champagne as some of the wealthiest men and women in the capital partied well into the night			1
yesterday , however , it was very much jeans and wellies as she stomped around in the woods with a group of 28 youngsters aged eight and nine			2
unsurprisingly , @entity6 went into the woods in style : her leather - lined wellingtons cost just under £ 300 and were made by 80 - year - old @entity82 bootmaker @entity80 , which specialises in upmarket country attire			2
you want me to go in there ? @entity6 , who was visiting the ' @entity88 ' primary school camp was also impressed with @entity89 , eight , calling him a ' gentleman ' when he held a tent flap open for her on its website , it boasts that the footwear has ‘ full - grain leather ’ lining for ‘ warmth and comfort ’ and is made using the ‘ finest craftsmanship ’			1
her skin - tight blue jeans , however , were by @entity102 store @entity100 and cost just £ 29.99 as was her khaki jumper			0
her matching shirt was by @entity105 and her waterproof waistcoat by outdoor clothing company really wild			0
she also sported heavy make up and her hair had been curled , held back from her face by a black plastic clip			0
the children @entity6 met came from the @entity112 which is based in @entity113 , @entity57			2
an area of high deprivation , more than 70 per cent of children under 15 in the area live in a jobless household			0
for many of the children , aged between and eight and nine years old , it was the first time they had seen the countryside or been away from home			0
quizzed : some of the children asked @entity6 about her job and she replied : ' it 's very busy and great fun but i am very well looked after ' on their three - day residential course the children had learnt to sleep in tipi tents and take part in team - building activities including rope challenges , obstacle courses , campfire building and outdoor cooking			1
@entity89 , eight , made @entity6 roar with laughter as he held open his tent flap for her and said : ' after you			2
’ ‘ what a gentleman , ’ she said			0
she was in fits of giggles again when the children told her that they had been a little scared on their first night out under the stars			0
‘ what were you scared of ? that a spider might creep in ? ’ she asked			0
‘ a mole , ’ said @entity89 , with enormous seriousness			0
then it was out along a muddy path to the woods where the rest of the group were busy making shelters and camp fires			0
fairytale : another child on the camping trip asked the @entity6 how long she would sit on the throne to which @entity6 said tactfully , ' it 's not actually my job yet ! ' @entity39 marvelled at their efforts and even gamely crawled inside one of the shelters , sitting down in the dirt with the youngsters			1
one could be heard telling her he had been ‘ dead scared to go to the toilet ’ the night before			0
@entity6 and the children were then shown how to make dough sticks over the camp fire , with the @entity6 even trying a small bit of the smokey bread , which had been wrapped around a stick and cooked , and declaring it ‘ very nice ’			1
some of the children asked her about her job and she replied : ’ it ’s very busy and great fun but i am very well looked after			2
’ another asked her how long she would sit on the throne to which @entity6 said tactfully , ‘ it ’s not actually my job yet ! ’ after joining the youngsters for a private lunch she left by helicopter for @entity190 where prince @entity37 was due to play in a charity polo match			1
@entity47 spokesman , @entity192 , said the children had enjoyed themselves tremendously			2
‘ many of the children here live in flats with no gardens and little area to play			0
this has been such an experience for them			0

@entity6 replied being princess was ' very nice ' and said @entity37 was ' very sweet ' and ' spoiled her '
also asked how long she would sit on throne
