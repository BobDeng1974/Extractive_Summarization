polar ice sheets are now melting three times faster than they did in the 1990s , a ' definitive ' study of satellite data has found			1
the amount of ice lost from @entity7 and @entity8 is enough to raise world sea levels by almost one millimetre a year			1
since 1992 , it has added more than 1cm to global sea levels - contributing around a fifth of the total rise			1
about two thirds of the ice loss was from @entity7 and the remainder from @entity8 , said scientists			1
estimates have differed greatly , with some studies even suggesting gains rather than losses			0
the new survey is said to be the most accurate assessment to date , ending 20 years of @entity40 confirms that , with the exception of @entity8 , both land masses are losing ice			1
but big differences in the pace of change were seen at each pole			0
the new research concludes that @entity8 is melting , but points to the smaller ice sheet in @entity7 , which covers most of the island , as the bigger and more pressing issue			1
its melt rate has grown from about 55 billion tons a year in the 1990s to almost 290 billion tons a year recently , according to the study			2
' @entity7 is really taking off , ' said @entity56 scientist @entity55 , a co-author of the paper released thursday by the journal @entity59			1
one of the biggest wild cards in climate change has been figuring out how much the melting of the massive sheets of ice at the two poles would add to the seas			2
study leader professor @entity67 , from the @entity69 , said : ' the success of this venture is due to the co-operation of the international scientific community , and due to the provision of precise satellite sensors by our space agencies			0
an iceberg in or just outside the @entity80 fjord , that likely broke off from @entity82 , the fastest glacier in west @entity7 ' without these efforts , we would not be in a position to tell people with confidence how the @entity89 's ice sheets have changed , and to end the uncertainty that has existed for many years			1
' scientists blame man - made global warming for the melting			0
burning fossil fuels , such as coal and oil , emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that trap heat , warming the atmosphere and oceans			0
bit - by - bit , that erodes the ice sheets from above and below			2
snowfall replenishes the ice sheets , but has n't kept pace with the rate of melting			2
because the world 's oceans are so big , it takes a lot of ice melting - about 10 trillion tons - to raise sea levels 1 inch ( 2.5 centimeters )			1
since 1992 , ice sheets at the poles have lost nearly 5 trillion tons of ice , the study says , raising sea levels by about a half inch			1
that seemingly tiny extra bit probably worsened the flooding from an already devastating @entity122 last month , said @entity124 ice scientist @entity123 , another co-author of the study			2
he said the extra weight gives each wave a little more energy			0
' the more energy there is in a wave , the further the water can get inland , ' @entity123 said			0
globally , the world 's oceans rose about half a foot ( 15 centimeters ) on average in the @entity134			2
melting ice sheets accounts for about one - fifth of sea level rise			1
warmer water expands , contributing to the rise along with water from melting glaciers outside the polar regions			0
the scientists matched results from 10 satellite observations employing three separate techniques to spot changes on the @entity89			0
the aim was to reconcile differences between earlier studies			0
care was taken to compare similar geographical regions , time periods , and models of ice sheet behaviour			2
back in july this composite was released of @entity124 images showing the extent of surface melt on @entity7 's ice sheet on july 8 ( left ) and july 12 ( right ) rates of ice loss were calculated for @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity162 and the @entity163			1
although @entity8 showed a net increase in ice mass , this was not enough to compensate for larger losses elsewhere			1
the research is published today in the journal @entity59			0
commenting on the findings , professor @entity170 , a @entity171 climate scientist at @entity172 , said : ' this project is a spectacular achievement			0
the data will support essential testing of predictive models , and will lead to a better understanding of how sea - level change may depend on the human decisions that influence global temperatures			2
' the vast polar ice sheets lock up unimaginable amounts of water			0
the @entity163 ice sheet contains 30 million cubic kilometres of ice and holds around 90 % of all the fresh water on the surface of the @entity89			0
if the whole @entity163 ice sheet melted , sea levels would rise by more than 60 metres			1
the @entity7 ice sheet is much smaller , but would add seven metres to sea levels if it all melted away			1
just how much ice is melting at the two poles has been difficult for scientists to answer			0
in 2007 , the @entity197 did not include ice sheet melt in its calculations of future sea level rise because numbers were so uncertain			1
@entity124 chief scientist @entity202 , one of the few top ice researchers who was n't part of the study , praised the work			0
' understanding how and why the ice sheets are changing today better equips us for understanding and predicting how much and in what ways they will change in the future , ' he said .			0

the amount of ice now lost from @entity7 and @entity8 is enough to raise world sea levels by almost *1mm* every year
