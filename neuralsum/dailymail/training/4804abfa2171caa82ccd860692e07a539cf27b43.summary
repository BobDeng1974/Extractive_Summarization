the significant rise in families choosing to home school their children has raised concerns from public and government bodies			2
in @entity7 , home schooling is recognised as a legitimate way of providing for the educational needs of children , and increasingly parents are deciding to educate their children through the non-traditional method			1
children between the ages of 6 and 16 are required to undergo some form of education , and while less than 1 % of children in @entity7 are home schooled , the @entity13 reported a 40 % increase in the number of those home schooled from 2009 to 2013			1
it has been estimated that up to 10,000 children in @entity25 are being home schooled for reasons including ideological or religious views , bullying in schools , or a belief that the traditional method of formal education is failing a new generation of @entity33			1
mum - of - five @entity34 has homeschooled all five of her children is an advocate for the method ' i was gobsmacked that people were willing to give their children up so early and move on			1
i could n't understand and really saw giving children to others as a weakening thing , ' @entity34 said this is the case for mum - of - five @entity34 , who chose to home school all of her children			1
' from very early on after i had my first child , i heard people talking about what preschool they were going to send their child to , ' @entity34 said			1
' i was gobsmacked that people were willing to give their children up so early and move on			2
i could n't understand and really saw giving children to others as a weakening thing			2
' ' it 's so important for parents to pass on values and that takes time			2
if their children are gone for 6 to 8 hours of the day that 's the best time			2
' ' it seems unnatural to me that a young baby could walk and talk without needing lessons , and yet it was just accepted that they would need to be handed over to experts to learnt to read and write			0
' for the state governments , finding the right balance between allowing parents their given right to educate their children in the method they see fit and ensuring that these children all receive a comparable level of education that prepares them for work or further study has proven a difficult task			1
' when i first started out 21 years ago , people were so critical			1
there was a lot of fear and anxiety and but now that i 've been out of the box for so long i 've developed more strength and balance , ' @entity34 said			1
' in the beginning , you were a criminal if you did it			2
i would put it on the level of persecution , but it was just a fear - based response			2
back then , it was so unknown that people immediately felt threatened			0
' ' now , it 's much more common			0
pretty much everyone talk to knows someone who is homeschooled and it 's much more encouraging , ' she said			2
however , the learning structure for the @entity100 's is quite different to those in traditional education , and according to @entity34 , allows for greater freedom of mind			1
' we make sure all our learning happens in positive environments			2
we sit in a circle in the sunshine , or cuddled up together in bed			0
' ' what we learn is very directed by what the children are interested in			2
we get to have long discussions and jump into different aspects of a book , like the history of the setting , or grammar , or the author , or moral questions			0
' ' i do n't like that in school these are all so divided			0
learning should be a wholistic experience so that children stay inspired with the joy of learning			1
' registration for home schooling is compulsory in many states , including @entity25 , @entity133 , @entity7 , and @entity134 , but as education curriculum and requirements varies depending on the state , understanding the desires and needs of those involved is often barred by red tape and unreliable statistics			1
many in the home schooling community have responded to this , with a group of @entity147 home educators forming a petition that protests against what they view as unnecessary paperwork and unreasonable standards which make it more difficult to home school children			1
the @entity155 collected more than 10,000 signatures which called for more consultation on the issue of home schooling , which was lodged in parliament by @entity164 state @entity162 mp @entity161 ( above ) @entity165 , general manager of the @entity166 said that in an era of rapid change for education , home schooling was significantly increasing			1
' it is important for governments to recognise such changes and developments , and move to accommodate them on the @entity33 educational landscape , ' mr @entity165 said			0
the @entity155 collected more than 10,000 signatures which called for more consultation on the issue , which was lodged in parliament by @entity164 state @entity162 mp @entity161 , reported @entity181			1
many parents choose to educate their children at home in order to allow what they see as a much more natural development , and to allow them to spend quality time together as a family that can be denied by traditional education			1
' these are human beings			0
they need time to understand how they function and live in the world , ' said @entity34			2
' i see homeschooling as a wonderful opportunity to train my child carefully			0
instead of throwing my child into the deep end of the pool , i can take my child 's hand and walk into the shallow end , help him through to the deep end and then let go			0
' ' we spend so much time together , and i really think that children who are homeschooled are much more emotionally mature because everything is a negotiation			1
' ' they are much less jaded and have a lot more agency for life			0
' @entity34 said that many parents choose to educate their children at home because of bullying in schools , and in order to remove the competitive element from learning			1
' why should children compete for their education ? that is barbarous , ' said @entity34			1
' the whole system should be overhauled			0
traditional education turns off the joy of learning , and teaches them to walk a treadmill			1
' ' it 's a great danger to do that to any mind			0
' @entity165 , general manager of the @entity166 said that in an era of rapid change for education , home schooling was significantly increasing in response to the growth of home education , and amid concerns regarding child welfare in homeschool environments , a @entity234 inquiry was launched in may by the @entity241 , which received submissions until august			2
hundreds of submissions were made by parents , lobby groups , teachers ’ unions and government departments , many of whom expressed a frustration with the limitations traditional school education placed on their families and with the expectations outlined in the state governments home schooling package which was released in 2013			1
' employees from the home school unit can either be supportive of the method or against it , and you never really know who you 're going to get , ' @entity34 said			1
' all of the people on the board have gone through traditional school educations and are completely ignorant			0
there 's a huge spectrum of opinions in the home schooling community , and we 'd like to see that reflected on the board			0
' ' it 's a very combative approach , as they 're a very critical authority			0
we are much more open and fluid and operate outside of the system and we 'd prefer to be addressed that way than always be in conflict , which is very inflammatory			0
' the @entity279 noted in their submission that there were concerns that home schooling provided the potential for masking child abuse , ' as there are fewer opportunities for those outside the home to note possible concerns and to raise any necessary alarms '			0
the submission also raised the issue of the lack of peer interaction , noting that ' the quality of interaction between peers in a classroom can enhance the learning experience			2
' @entity34 stressed the point that the lack of socialisation for homeschooled children is a myth			1
' the homeschool network is so large and varied , in terms of background and ages , that homeschooled children probably have a wider social network than children who attend school and are in a class with peers who are only their age , ' she said			1
' there are excursions on all the time , so if you wanted to meet with others you could do so morning and afternoon , five days a week			0
' ' the younger are lead by the older , and the family unit is kept together , which creates a much stronger bond			0
it 's very positive thing for the community to have families like that			0
' ' some might consider it a drawback that they will take longer to fit into the system of work , and that can make waves , but i 'd rather have that than have someone who ’s mind is turned off			0
' ' my children have all been raised freethinkers , and i 'd much rather have that than a numbing of the brain			0
' ' they have a stronger sense of who they are and have n’t become detatched by the mindlessness of the traditional school system			0
if they have to learn to navigate a system i 'd rather have them do that at 18 or 21 rather than when they 're five			0

up to 10,000 children are homeschooled in @entity25 and there has been a 40 % increase in the past four years
parents who homeschool say the standards set by state curriculum are too high and that the method creates emotionally mature free thinkers
@entity34 homeschooled all five of her children and said that when she began 20 years ago she faced persecution and was thought criminal
she said that learning should be a wholistic experience and should encourage the joy of learning , rather than making students compete for their education
