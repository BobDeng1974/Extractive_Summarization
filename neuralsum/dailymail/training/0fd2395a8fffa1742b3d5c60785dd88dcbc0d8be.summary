@entity4 has been sent a bill for £ 18,500 after she ignored parking fines for more than a year after she continually parked on cobbles outside her garage - wrongly believing she was entitled to park her @entity20 there the firm said @entity23 has not challenged a single fine issued to her over more than a year and was not entitled to leave her car there because motorists are not allowed to park in covered passage ways , and also need a permit to leave their cars in the area			1
miss @entity4 , who said she came to regard the daily tickets as an annoyance , has been parking her @entity20 on the cobbles outside her driveway for more than a year			1
she said : ' we have a right to park in front of our own property			0
i 've considered moving out			0
it just makes my life so hellish			0
' i always make a point of parking in front of my own garage , where nobody else could park , and never parking on the double yellow lines on the road			2

a spokesman said : ' the site in question is covered by a contract that restricts use of the rear car park to permit holders only and prohibits motorists from parking in the covered vehicle access passage ways			0

' it is therefore not unreasonable to expect motorists to adhere to these terms and conditions by not parking in restricted areas and displaying a valid permit in the car park			0
' ms @entity4 has constantly breached the terms and conditions of this contract by repeatedly parking in a restricted area / parking without displaying a valid permit			2
' the company said every time miss @entity4 has parked in the area she has been issued with a ticket , and each time she received a ticket had the opportunity to appeal the fine			1
but each time she failed to do so			0
the spokesman said the fine is so high because they have also had find out the details of who owned the car to trace it back to @entity23 and demand the total parking fine be paid			0
ms @entity4 came to regard the fines as an annoyance and discarded them , but the bill has now racked up he added : ' in the absence of any contact from ms @entity4 coupled with the fact that she continues to contravene the terms and conditions of this site , which we are contractually bound to enforce , we have had no alternative but to initiate @entity110 action via our agents in @entity112 , @entity113			1
' miss @entity4 , who lives with her parents , said the situation has become so stressful she is considering moving house			0
she said she feels she has been targeted by the parking firm and believes other cars in the area have not been given tickets			2
