@entity1 ’ drastic cost - cutting across the board after paying £ 11million a match to retain @entity5 rights is being blamed for the demise of the @entity7 , the home nations international under 16 tournament			1
the @entity9 announced this week that @entity10 are pulling out of the event with immediate effect in order to achieve a more varied fixture list , including more foreign opposition			2
@entity10 have pulled out of the home nations international under 16 tournament but it is understood this surprise move has been prompted by @entity1 allegedly withdrawing their title sponsorship as well as reducing live coverage and wanting further changes to the format and another backer found			1
@entity28 , @entity9 ’s head of @entity29 , said : ‘ we feel due to the uncertainly around the @entity7 and the potential changes suggested by @entity1 , it is a good time to review our fixtures and make an early decision			1
’ however , @entity1 say that their recommendations , including shortening the time between games , would have raised the profile of an historic competition that first took place in 1925 and whose notable players include sir @entity39 , sir @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			1
meanwhile , @entity1 ’s price hikes involving all their programming since almost breaking the bank by committing £ 4.2bn to @entity5 football are significantly more than the @entity50 spin machine suggested			1
the variety bundle has gone up 7.1 per cent , sports by 4 per cent — double for @entity54 cable subscribers — the @entity56 pack by 9.8 per cent and the full total by 6.4 per cent referee @entity58 travelled in business class on return from @entity61 it did not give the impression that referee @entity58 and his assistants were a team on returning from officiating @entity67 ’s destruction of @entity68 in the @entity69			2
@entity58 and assistants @entity70 and @entity72 travelled in business class on their @entity75 flight home while fourth official @entity76 was in economy			0
@entity10 head coach @entity78 has influential supporters on board @entity10 head coach @entity78 will report to the new @entity10 director of cricket , who in turn will have @entity85 chief executive @entity84 as his boss in the structure going forward			0
but it certainly helps @entity78 ’ survival hopes that his assistant @entity90 is highly rated and considered an important voice in the dressing room			0
@entity93 are to broadcast the inaugural @entity94 in @entity95 in june , having finally agreed terms			1
the deal will be announced on thursday along with @entity98 , whose best known names are @entity102 boxing and taekwondo gold medallists @entity104 and @entity106			2
@entity108 legend @entity107 will enjoy a short stopover in @entity110 on thursday @entity107 ’s @entity110 highlife @entity107 's enduring reputation as the world ’s greatest footballer will be enhanced during a short stopover in @entity110			1
the @entity108 legend is due at the @entity116 in @entity117 on thursday to promote an art exhibition inspired by his life and to celebrate his 75th birthday in october			1
on display will be pop artist @entity122 ’s original acrylic and silkscreen ink on canvas 1977 work of @entity107 in his final year with @entity127			2
the painting is valued at $ 10million — and no picture of @entity130 , @entity131 or @entity132 can compete with that			0
later , @entity107 will be going to a party organised by his agents @entity136 , where he will be introduced to other clients including @entity138			2
@entity139 , one of football ’s most notorious agents , has been declared bankrupt at a hearing in @entity143			0
@entity139 , who used to run his agency business from the multi-millionaire tax haven of @entity146 and had racing stables in @entity148 , revealed assets of just £ 987 , while court documents detailed that he owed £ 713,292			0
when football democracy is so skewered that @entity151 ’s three rivals for the @entity155 presidency are denied the opportunity to address the @entity159 @entity158 confederation , no wonder @entity151 feels no need to set up an election team			0
however , it does look like @entity151 has been promising his support for the 2019 @entity155 leadership to @entity158 chief @entity165 , who is noticeably more aligned to @entity151 than he was a few months ago			0
there is no stopping the @entity168 charm offensive with his @entity170 foundation backing a campaign for a pioneering cancer treatment to be made available on the @entity173 .			0
