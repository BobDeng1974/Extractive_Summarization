one morning single mother @entity0 awoke in a hospital bed with no recollection of how she 'd got there			1
the shocking truth was the then 35 year old had collapsed on her doorstep the night before while smoking a cigarette after downing three bottles of wine			1
she was rushed to @entity9 thanks to a friend who happened to be passing her house in @entity13 and spotted her slumped body			0
beat the booze : @entity0 says she 's happier now she no longer drinks and wants to help other people beat alcohol addiction the fact that she had drunk so much on a night at home alone was not unusual			1
@entity0 told the @entity21 she had become accustomed to drinking two to two - and - half bottles of wine on an evening at home or when out with friends			1
but her trip to hospital was the wake up call she needed to change her ways			0
she said : ' i grew up with the @entity32 ladette culture			0
going out and getting drunk was the norm in my twenties and continued into my thirties			1
i could never have just one or two drinks			0
' as i got older and had a daughter and then divorced , drinking became a coping mechanism for stress release			2
some nights i would drink more than two bottles of wine			2
' waking up in hospital was the wake up call i needed			0
i could n't carry on the way i was ' @entity0 realised she had become too dependent on alcohol and sought help for her addiction			2
however , aside from @entity51 , which she did n't want to join , she found there was little support for women like her			1
hitting the bottle : an increasing number of women aged 30 - 50 are dependent on alcohol to cope with modern life ( posed by model ) she said : ' the aa works for some people but you have to commit to attending meetings and as a single mum , i could n't do that			1
it was n't right for me , especially as i did n't feel i had a hardcore addiction			0
' with the support of a friend , who also gave up alcohol at the same time and a new partner , @entity0 was able to beat her addiction			1
she said : ' i found other activities to fill my time			2
i stopped going to the pub and i took up running which became my stress release			0
i broke the habits i had formed around drinking			2
' @entity0 found the more she avoided alcohol the better she felt about herself and she became a better parent to her daughter , now aged 14			1
she said : ' it was n't a case of her being neglected			0
she rarely saw me drunk as it was always in the evenings but it still had an insidious effect			0
i was always hungover so i was grumpy and had no energy to do things like help her with her homework or take her swimming			0
i was always muddling through with a hangover			0
i 'm a much better parent now			0
' problem : some users seeking help from the website @entity98 , many of whom are mothers , are consuming two to three bottles of wine a night but @entity0 , now 37 , still found the process of battling the bottle could sometimes be a lonely experience			1
she began to write a blog in april 2011 sharing her feelings and then the idea was born to launch a website where people like her could come together and support one another			2
she launched @entity98 last november as a place for ' people who are trying to resolve their problematic drinking patterns , and people who have successfully kicked the booze '			1
a forum , blog and articles offering advice and support are all available to members - many of whom are middle - aged , middle class mothers			1
more than 1,500 members have already signed up and @entity0 believes 90 per cent of them are mothers aged 30 - 50 who are in a similar place to where she once was			1
as well as increasing their risk of a drunken accident that could result in them waking up in hospital like @entity0 did two years ago , these women are also in danger of ruining their long - term health with alcohol abuse raising their chance of getting a serious illness like liver disease			1
support : the website aims to help people via their forum , blog and articles the @entity98 forum is also rife with the experiences of those who have lost their jobs or damaged their relationships with friends and family due to their alcohol dependency			2
the @entity156 recommend that women should not regularly drink more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day			2
but many are exceeding these guidelines on nights out or when drinking alone at home			0
@entity164 aims to help these people by giving them a place where they can ' talk , write , offload , and share ' their experiences with like - minded people			1
@entity0 , who no longer drinks any alcohol , hopes the website can help people create a better life for themselves like she has done			1
she said : ' you ca n't stay that way , you have to have an open mind to change and open yourself up to new experiences			0
' i enjoy not drinking now , i have grown as a person and discovered there is much more to life than getting drunk			0
i do n't miss drinking at all			0

drinking to excess was the norm for mother @entity0 in her twenties and thirties
@entity188 came when she collapsed after downing three bottles of wine in a night
she found there was little support to help her kick the habit so she set up her own website , @entity164 , where addicts can meet to ' resolve their problematic drinking patterns '
90 *%* of members are women aged 30 - 50 drinking to cope with the stresses of careers and motherhood
