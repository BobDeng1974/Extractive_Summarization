by @entity0 last updated at 1:31 pm on 6th january 2012 large parts of @entity2 are suffering the worst dearth of snow in decades as the @entity6 ' @entity5 ' costs the country 's tourism industry tens of millions of dollars			1
in @entity11 states like @entity12 and @entity13 , natural snow has either melted or been washed away , as ski resort bosses count the cost of a barren december			1
the two states are among a number which are normally completely buried at this time of year , but the distinctly brown @entity18 has left the outlook bleak for winter recreation enthusiasts			0
dry season : man made snow covers a ski run at @entity26 ski area in @entity27 , @entity12 , one of several facilities to suffer from the barren december elsewhere @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33 , all places which are normally buried in feet of snow at this time of year , had the third - lightest snowfall on record between october and december			1
nationwide , the lack of snow is costing tens of millions of dollars in winter recreation , restaurant , lodging and sporting goods sales , experts said			1
she 's playing tricks on us , or something			0
now it 's getting nerve - racking , ' said @entity52 , whose cash flow is nonexistent because her rental cabins are empty at @entity56 , north of @entity12 's @entity57 , normally alive this time of year with the buzz of snowmobiles			1
early in the winter , the @entity60 saw some heavy snow , as did parts of the @entity11 clobbered around @entity64 and @entity65 by snow that has since melted			1
the @entity67 has seen snow recently			1
and longer - range forecasts predict above - normal or normal snow amounts for much of the country 's northern half for the rest of the season			1
many economic losses can be made up , said @entity76 , an economist at the @entity78 's @entity77			0
but that 's of little comfort right now in the @entity11 , where businesses that depend on winter recreation usually see heaps of snow around the @entity18 and @entity86 holidays as a bonus and it 's critical to have snow by @entity89 weekend , about a week from now			2
as of thursday , only 19 percent of the nation was covered in snow , less than half the average snow cover over the past five years on the same date , according to the @entity95 's @entity94 in @entity96			1
the @entity26 ski area in @entity27 , @entity12 , along with similar ski resorts in @entity13 and @entity99 , have been the ones worst affected by the lack of snow on friday , the forecast calls for the @entity11 to thaw out from its first big cold spell			1
it 'll be in the 50s and sunny in @entity107 , @entity108 , a place that normally sees snow by now			1
in the @entity2 , where the temperature hit the 40s thursday , the warm weather has turned frozen ponds and backyard rinks to slush , sending ice skaters indoors			0
' there 's no place that has reliable ice			0
you 're skating on @entity121 you try to shoot the puck			0
it goes a little ways and it gets stuck in a puddle , ' said @entity126 , who has seen a big uptick in the number of participants in pickup hockey games she organizes at indoor rinks in @entity96 's @entity133 region			0
a graphic from the @entity94 shows the anticipated snowfall in northeastern @entity6 states over the next few days @entity137 , a pilot with the @entity138 , said he flew over southern @entity96 on thursday and saw lots of open water and ice that 's too dangerous for fishing			1
' there was no snow — zero , ' he said			2
' i was at 2,000 feet ; my temperature gauge was reading 62 degrees			0
that 's more like april weather than january weather			0
' @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33 , normally buried in feet of snow by now , had the third - lightest snowfall on record from october through december			1
@entity107 recorded its driest december in history , according to the @entity154 at @entity155 in @entity33			1
while some resorts have suffered due to lack of snow , similar facilities across @entity157 have been forced to close due to have too much of it			2
ski resorts across @entity162 and @entity163 say they are now struggling to cope after metres of snow combined with high winds and stormy conditions over the past 48 hours left runs blocked or in danger of avalanches			2
changeable temperatures combined with high winds and new snow has put many ski resorts across @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 on high avalanche alert			2
temperatures are expected to drop dramatically over the weekend and winds today ( friday ) have already reached over 170 kph making conditions even more treacherous			0
avalanche experts are working around the clock to assess the risks and where necessary and possible are carrying out controlled detonations			0
@entity183 , manager of the avalanche action team in @entity174 said : ' with winds peaking at 170 kph we can safely talk about a hurricane			0
' heavy new snow , freezing temperatures and the hurricane we are talking about high risk			2
the avalanche risk across @entity174 is high and it will rise			0
' ' it 's been 128 years since @entity107 did n't have snow in december , ' said @entity195 , owner of a retail golf shop in @entity107			1
' not only have we not had snow , but it 's been mild so you can play golf			2
' he said he thinks snow will arrive in time to satisfy skiers			2
and what 's good for skiers , he added , will be good for golfers in the end			0
' we need the snow to water the golf courses , ' he said			2
the ski industry is also having a tough time in @entity99			1
ski resorts have a core of skiers and boarders who are season ticket holders or have slope - side condos			2
those folks are going to go ski because they 've invested ; what 's lacking are the thousands of additional skiers — the weekend warriors — who are less likely to spend their dollars unless conditions are great			0
in @entity12 , up to 100 people would be skiing on 12 miles of trails on a good day at @entity230 's @entity229 , but the center has yet to open because there 's no snow on the ground			1
worse , with no snow , no one is buying skiing gear from the store , said manager @entity239			2
it 's discouraging , he said , given high hopes that accompanied the early snowfall in october and november			1
' it was just a big tease , ' he said			0
fresh snow , said @entity245 , a skier from @entity246 , plays a psychological factor in motivating ' weekend warriors			0
' he admits to a bit of angst			0
' it 's mostly anxiety , but i try to remember it 's going to happen , ' he said			0
' it 's just a matter of time			0
' in @entity13 , there 's no snow to slow down republicans as they zoom across the state to make their last push before next week 's primary vote			1
but the lack of snow means the state is missing its snowy backdrop as bundled - up journalists provide the latest political reports			1
and candidates have been unable to plunk campaign signs down in snow drifts to provide a showy backdrop for public appearances			0
' it 's an iconic part of the primary , ' said @entity277 , political science professor at @entity278			0
' it 's part of the ambiance — the mill shots in @entity282 , the snow - covered town squares , watching candidates shuffle through the snow			1

@entity13 , @entity12 and @entity99 see much less snow cover
@entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33 , had the third - lightest snowfall on record between october and december .
@entity6 overall sees just 19 *%* snow - half the usual average
