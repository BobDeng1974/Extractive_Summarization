by @entity0 for @entity1 the name of the five - year - old gelding peering from the box in what was once known as @entity7 ’s row is highly appropriate — emerging talent			2
the winner of a @entity10 at @entity11 is a symbol of change at the @entity15 stable of champion jumps trainer @entity17			1
where once stood 2008 @entity20 winner @entity25 , 2012 @entity28 winner @entity26 , dual champion chaser master minded and the daddy of them all , dual @entity20 hero and five - time @entity22 winner @entity21 , there are now only plaques listing their achievements			1
optimistic : trainer @entity17 at his @entity15 stables last to retirement last season was four - time @entity39 winner @entity38 ’s and @entity40 , a relative newcomer to the ditcheat operation , but one who quickly became part of the furniture			1
their departures finally bolted the door on a golden era			0
where once stood achievement , there is now aspiration , hope and promise			0
when @entity17 welcomes 350 guests to his private owners ’ day this morning , there will see around 50 new horses – close to a third of the stable for the forthcoming new season			1
leading the team may be 2013 @entity22 winner @entity64 , who could make an earlier than expected return to action in the @entity67 at @entity68 on november 1			0
but the focus will be on fresh stock like @entity73 imports @entity71 and three - year - old @entity74 , half - brother to stablemate @entity76 who will go novice chasing after winning four hurdle race last year culminating in the @entity79			2
it will not only be fresh equine talent on show			0
after @entity83 ’s brief tenure as main rider to the stable , new stable jockey for the 2014 - 15 season is @entity87 with @entity88 as his understudy			1
number one : jockey @entity87 will be @entity17 ' main rider in the 2014 - 15 season with the surprise announcement that @entity17 ’ nephew and conditional jockey @entity93 is quitting riding , there will be also be more chances for fellow conditional @entity97 , son former jockey and trainer @entity98 , plus @entity100 , son of welsh trainer @entity101 , who is about to join stable			1
a new set of priorities are driving @entity17 , who unexpectedly wrestled back his champion trainer ’s title from great rival @entity106 last season to become champion jumps trainer for an eighth time			1
@entity17 said : ‘ it is now all about the future			1
i am not starting this season trying to win the champion			1
‘ i have been lucky and won it eight times but that means it is almost like numbers now			0
i do n’t have to be champion to be where i want to be			0
‘ i enjoy bringing the young horses so much – i am not going to lose sleep if i do n’t win the title			2
‘ we have had the biggest clear - out as we have ever had			0
over 50 horses have been sold or moved on			0
‘ @entity26 , @entity25 , @entity38 ’s , @entity127 , @entity21 - you can go on and on			1
it was a golden era - amazing			0
back - up : @entity88 will provide support for @entity87 ‘ we will probably never replace them			1
in fact , i do n’t think we ’ll ever see so many good horses in one yard at one time again			0
it is like starting again and it is exciting			0
’ @entity17 uses the same words when talking about 21 - year - old @entity87			1
@entity83 never seemed at ease last year as the stable ’s top jockey as he tried to replace long - time @entity17 ally @entity139			2
@entity17 was forced to move when it seemed @entity87 , who will still ride father @entity141 hope @entity142 , was about to be lured out of his reach by a rival job offer			1
@entity17 , who often uses his owner and @entity148 @entity147 boss sir @entity146 as a sounding board , added : ‘ it was all forced on us probably a year before we thought it might happen but @entity146 always says you would n’t want to let a top striker sign up for an opposing team and regret it for the rest of your life			2
‘ i like @entity87 a lot			2
he is nowhere near the finished article			0
you should remember what @entity139 was like at the same age and how must better he got – the same with @entity163			0
‘ @entity87 will be under a bit of pressure and need time to bed in but i am not worried about that – we will deal with it			2
’ buy the @entity171 brochure ( £ 15 inc p&p ) at @entity172 ( all proceeds to charity )			0

@entity87 will be @entity17 ' main rider for 2014 - 15 with @entity88 as his understudy
horses such as @entity38 *'s* , @entity179 and @entity21 have retired
