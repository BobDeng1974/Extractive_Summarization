a council is set to build a £ 12,000 ' noise barrier ' at a children 's playground - because the sound of youngsters having fun is too loud			1
@entity6 in @entity7 hit headlines last june after it was closed following a single complaint about the noise of children playing			1
but after a public outcry , @entity13 bowed to pressure and re-opened the facility - reinstating the original opening times			2
controversial : @entity6 in @entity7 is set to feature a two - metre high £ 12,000 ' sound barrier ' around its perimeter because the sound of children playing is too loud they will now spend thousands of pounds erecting an accoustic sound barrier measuring two metres high and 13.5 metres long to cut the noise			1
they came to the decision after sound monitoring showed the noise levels in the playground were unacceptably high over a six week period			1
using @entity36 noise measurements , the level of sound coming from the play area when it was not in operation was between @entity37 ( decibels ) and @entity38			1
a six - week experiment at the playground in @entity6 recorded noise levels of 57 decibels when children were playing			1
this was deemed too loud			0
noise is measured in units called decibels ( @entity46 )			2
the higher the number in decibels , the louder the noise			2
here is a list of noises with their relevant decibel levels			0
aircraft at take - off : 180 fireworks : 140 snowmobile 120 chain saw : 110 amplified music : 110 lawn mower : 90 noisy office : 90 vacuum cleaner : 80 city traffic : 80 normal conversation : 60 refrigerator humming : 40 whisper : 20 leaves rustling : 10 calm breathing : 10 source : hearing @entity69 when the play area was in use however , the noise levels rose to an average of between @entity74 and @entity75			1
it is estimated that the accoustic sound barrier would cut the noise by @entity79			2
the cost of the screen would be paid for out of the council 's capital programme			0
additionally it was recommended that a landscaped shrub border be planted to address the issue of parents allowing their children to urinate next to residents gardens - at a cost of approximately £ 2,500			0
the committee also agreed that further noise monitoring may be carried out on the site in the future to determine the effectiveness of the screen and whether it was necessary to install a second screen			0
at the meeting councillors were told the cost of relocating the wet play area would be around £ 100,000			0
at a meeting of the council 's environment committee on thursday , councillor @entity101 commented : ' on the site visit we could see the different issues involved in it and all these recommendations are the answer			0
' the committee passed the recommendations , which included a provision that further noise monitoring may be carried out on the site in the future to determine the effectiveness of the screen and whether it was necessary to install a second screen			0
speaking at the time the play area was shut , @entity119 , of @entity120 , @entity121 , who went to the park with mother @entity124 , son @entity125 and niece @entity126 , both aged four , said : ' i ca n't believe one person can ruin so many children 's fun			0
stunned : @entity119 , of @entity120 , who often visits the park with her son @entity125 , ( pictured ) was shocked when the playground was closed in june following a single complaint about the noise ' we 've been visiting the park for years so were shocked to find the wet area closed - it was particularly upsetting for @entity125 and @entity126			1
' upon investigating we were told the opening hours had been reduced due to one nearby resident complaining about the noise of children playing			1
' it 's beyond belief someone would complain about children having fun - i 'm sure the traffic noise from the main road is far more disruptive			0

@entity6 in @entity7 *temporarily* closed in june
*popular* playground shut after a single complaint children played too loudly
@entity13 then *reopened* site and recorded playing noise at 57 decibels
sound level is *equivalent* to a normal conversation or quiet *laughter*
