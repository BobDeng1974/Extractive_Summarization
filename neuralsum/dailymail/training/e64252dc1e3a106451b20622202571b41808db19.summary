@entity0 and his discovery of the @entity2 in 1492 is one of the great stories of modern history			2
but five centuries after his momentous achievement , a @entity6 explorer wants to prove that @entity0 was actually beaten to it by another seafaring nation 1,000 years earlier			1
@entity10 believes the ancient @entity11 - a @entity13 civilization that prospered between @entity14 and @entity15 on the @entity17 coast - sailed to the @entity2 first			1
explorer @entity10 , left , wants to prove that the ancient civilisation the @entity11 discovered @entity20 before @entity0 in 1492 , right mr @entity10 built the @entity11 in 2008 exactly as it would have been 2,600 years ago and the former @entity23 fund manager from @entity24 , @entity25 , wants to prove it by sailing a replica boat he built exactly as it would have been 2,600 years ago across the @entity28			1
' it is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [ before @entity0 ] , it was the @entity11 , ' @entity10 told @entity36			1
' of all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- @entity40 had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats , they were the first to use iron nails , and they had knowledge of astrology and currents			0
' the @entity11 covered more than 20,000 miles when mr @entity10 sailed it around @entity49 in 2008 the theory that an @entity52 race discovered the @entity2 before @entity0 was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries after several ancient inscriptions were found in @entity20 which were said to be @entity55			1
but many historians still doubt that the @entity11 were capable of such a treacherous journey			0
mr @entity10 has already been on an epic voyage in his 50 tonne wooden vessel - aptly named the @entity60 - after he sailed it around @entity49 in 2010			1
traveller : @entity63 ( centre ) as @entity65 in @entity66 with @entity67 and @entity68 @entity65 is a fictional character who is the star of the 1873 @entity70 novel ' @entity66			0
' in the book , which has been made into several films - including one starring @entity63 ( above ) - @entity65 attempts to circumnavigate the world in eighty days , or less , for a wager of £ 20,000 with members of his @entity77 club			2
he vows to return to the club by 8.45pm on saturday 21 december 1872			0
he is followed by a detective named fix during his journey who suspects him of robbing the @entity84			0
while in @entity85 meets @entity86 , a widowed princess , and saves her from being burned to death during her husband 's funeral			0
she then travels with @entity65 for the rest of his journey			0
she and @entity65 eventually fall in love and marry			0
@entity65 arrives home thinking he has lost his bet - but he eventually finds out that he won			2
he hired archaeologists and traditional shipwrights to construct the boat based on the design of an ancient galley found wrecked in the western @entity17			2
it is almost 65ft in length , with a single sail and emergency oar holes for when the wind dropped			2
then , like a modern - day @entity65 , he set sail in it to prove that the fabled voyage was possible using only the power of the wind and the tide			1
he wanted to demonstrate that the @entity11 - referred to in the @entity111 as ' rulers of the sea ' - had the capability to circumnavigate the continent 2,000 years before the first recorded @entity116 which was @entity117 in 1488			2
setting sail from @entity118 in 2008 , he covered 20,000 miles over two years , battling everything from six - metre waves off the @entity121 to @entity123 pirates			1
and now he is willing to do it all again , provided he can raise the £ 100,000 he needs for the trip			0
the odyssey is expected to take two to three months , setting sail from @entity127 and arriving in @entity20 via the @entity28			1
he has also been invited by @entity129 's @entity128 to be part of the museum 's landmark exhibition on the @entity60 civilisation , opening in september 2014			1
' the conventional wisdom is that @entity0 discovered @entity20			0
but anyone who looks a little closer will see the @entity136 were there around @entity138			0
they 've found @entity142 settlements in @entity143 , it 's undisputed , ' @entity10 told @entity36			1
' so @entity0 was definitely second -- at best			0
i put forward the theory that the @entity11 could have been first and i hope to prove that was the case			1

former @entity23 fund manager @entity10 built replica @entity60 vessel
believes 50 - tonne wooden boat could have crossed the @entity28
will set sail from @entity127 to try and prove the theory himself
