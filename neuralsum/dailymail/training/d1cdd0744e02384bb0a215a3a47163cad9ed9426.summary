donor : @entity12 , pictured , answered an ad placed on @entity6 by @entity7 , and her partner @entity8 looking for a sperm donor battle : @entity7 and former partner @entity8 ( right ) are supporting their sperm donor @entity12 in his fight against paying child support for their daughter mr @entity12 provided sperm which was used for artificial insemination by ms @entity8			1
in return , he gave up parental rights including financial duties for the child			2
should sperm donors be exempt from all financial responsibility for the child ? should sperm donors be exempt from all financial responsibility for the child ? now share your opinion the three signed a legal document which stated mr @entity12 , a married mechanic who fosters children with his wife , would have no rights to the child			1
@entity7 and @entity8 updated @entity12 on their daughter 's well - being occasionally but he has had little contact , according to the @entity44			1
the arrangement changed earlier this year when ms @entity8 , the only parent registered on her daughter 's birth certificate , applied for social welfare			1
ms @entity7 had been supporting the child but was left unable to work due to ill health			2
on october 3 , 2012 , attorney @entity51 filed a petition on behalf of the @entity53 seeking a ruling that @entity12 is the father of @entity8 's child and owes a duty to support her			1
@entity57 : ms @entity7 and ms @entity8 celebrating their same - sex union			1
the couple adopted eight children together during their relationship but have not been given the same rights as straight couples caregiver : mr @entity12 is a married mechanic who fosters children with his wife it said the department provided cash assistance totaling $ 189 for the girl for july through september 2012 , and had paid medical expenses totaling nearly $ 6,000			1
@entity8 had allegedly been put under pressure to reveal mr @entity12 's name so that her daughter could continue to have health care			1
the legal agreement that the three made in 2009 was deemed invalid by @entity77 because they did not use a certified doctor for the insemination			0
it may appear unconventional but searching for sperm donors on @entity6 is not unheard of			0
in 2010 , the popular cafemom blog lit up in outrage after a man from @entity86 , @entity82 advertised his sperm donor services on @entity6			0
he wrote : ' i 'm ready to help			0
we 'd be very discreet , no one needs to know			0
' another ad for a potential donor in @entity93 read : ' i 'm not offering thrilling risky sex , just pregnancy			2

we are going to support him in whatever action he wants to go forward with			0
' @entity130 , mr @entity12 's attorney , argued that the case was consistent with a 2007 case in which the @entity133 denied parental rights to a man who sought them after providing a sperm donation under similar circumstances			1
a licensed physician performed the insemination in the 2007 case			0
@entity130 wrote that @entity12 took the same actions as the man in the 2007 case did , and he - like that man - should be considered a sperm donor , not a father			2
she stressed that sperm banks regularly ship donations for the intended purpose of artificial insemination within the @entity150 and abroad to both residential and medical facility addresses			0
@entity130 argued in court documents that if a donor is free of parental responsibility only when a doctor performs an insemination , ' then any woman in @entity158 could have sperm donations shipped to her house , inseminate herself without a licensed physician and seek out the donor for financial support because her actions made him a father , not a sperm donor			1
' this goes against the very purpose of the statute to protect sperm donors as well as birth mothers '			0
ms @entity7 and ms @entity8 had been together for eight years and adopted eight children			1
they ended their relationship in 2010 but continue to co-parent their sons and daughters who range from three months to 25 years old			0
the state of @entity158 does not recognize same - sex unions , so each of their children was registered for adoption by a single parent			2

@entity189 , spokeswoman for the @entity190 , said that @entity158 law prevented her from commenting on the case			0
