by @entity0 published : 05:43 est , 3 september 2013 updated : 05:55 est , 3 september 2013 when pretty @entity3 steps into the wrestling ring her male opponents may be taken aback			1
but , despite her feminine looks and curves , the 5ft 11in , 57kg stunner packs a serious punch when she fights under her alter ego , @entity10			1
the @entity12 beauty is in fact the @entity15 's only transgender wrestler and , after months of training , is preparing to take on the men in her first wrestling matches			1
@entity3 - @entity20 always felt there was something different about him as a young boy ( left ) and , after transitioning from man to woman in 2007 , chose to pursue his dream of becoming a female wrestler ( right ) at 5ft 11 and with a @entity12 bra size , @entity3 - @entity20 's feminine appearance does n't detract from her performance in the ring the 24 - year - old was so obsessed with female wrestlers when she was a teenager that she decided to become one - despite having been born a boy			1
she said : ' wrestling has always been a passion of mine and i grew up with it for many years			1
i ’ve been inspired by @entity39 from @entity40 , she was my idol as a wrestler and it ’s who i want to be like			1
' @entity44 changed from man to woman after telling doctors she was trapped in the wrong body as a teen			2
it encouraged her to pursue her dream of becoming a wrestler after idolising women in the sport throughout her childhood			1
the make - up artist , who works in @entity58 , was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 18 after telling doctors how she felt about her body @entity3 ( pictured left as a boy aged five ) idolised female wrestlers throughout her childhood and when she transitioned to a woman was able to pursue her dream to be one and for the last three months , she has been in the ring training as a wrestler and is now preparing for her first fight			1
@entity44 , from @entity69 , admits : ' it is tough			2
i come away with lots of bumps and bruises but at the end of the day if it ’s not in your heart you ’re not going to make it			2
' i think it takes a strange breed of person to get into this business			2
you have to be a bit different to jump into a ring and say ‘ i ’m going to beat myself up today			1
’ she continued : ' the men are very comfortable with me			1
they ’re all nice and make sure they care for me			2
every time they give me a move they will ask me if i am ok			2
they do make sure i am in safe hands			2
' it ’s not an issue for them			0
the guys are really supportive and in a way it ’s really surprising because that world , the wrestling world , can be masculine and macho			1
' @entity44 has struggled with her transition into a woman ; being bullied and suffering with depression she trains for hours a week with professional wrestling company , @entity110 , completing thousands of press - ups , sit - ups , running intense drills and now manages routines for other wrestlers			1
' we do a huge workout at the beginning of the session , ' she said			0
' then we do a lot of moves			0
we learnt how to take a backdrop and how to land on the mats because when you fall back , you hurt you back and you ’ve got to know how to do it properly			0
' @entity44 , who appeared on the hit reality show ‘ my @entity128 , ’ started her transition to a woman in 2007			1
the make - up artist , who works in @entity58 , was diagnosed with gender dysphoria when she was 18			1
the 57kg beauty is putting her stamp on the wrestling world and wiping the floor with her male opponents the condition leaves sufferers feeling there is a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity			1
the journey from man to woman has n’t been an easy one for her			0
she battled with depression , self - harming and was abused in the street by strangers			1
she said : ' i used to get bullied a lot			0
people would shout at me in the street just randomly , saying that i looked like a man or yelling ‘ tranny ’ - just really horrible things			1
i did n’t look like i do back then			0
i had braces , my hair was white and i did n’t know how to do my make - up			2
' because my childhood was quite open i never understood why i was getting bullied			0
people would always put me down and call me gay and poof			0
' i used to stop myself from eating and starve myself and hope that i would n’t wake up and hope that i would die in my sleep			0
' i used to play with @entity167 dolls and dress up but because my family was really open minded , no one questioned my behaviour and so i did n’t question it myself			0
' when i was eight or nine years old that ’s when i really got this feeling that i was trapped in the wrong body			0
' she admits she was apprehensive about joining the masculine world of wrestling at first			2
' i rang them up and explained that i wanted to get into wrestling but that i was very nervous because of being transgender and that i know it is a very male - orientated environment , ' she explained			1
' i was quite scared about being in that situation where it is hands on and you ’re with the guys and i was worrying about that			0
' the wrestler , who has never revealed her former male name , has been taking hormone supplements for the last three years and with the help of a padded bra is now happy with her new look			2
' i ’m quite lucky in terms of the way i look but i ’m planning on a couple of surgeries			0
i want a couple on my face so it ’s kind of a lengthy process but i ’m quite happy now , ' she said			0
' the things that i would like are kind of cosmetic			0
hopefully by the time i ’m 30 i will be fully complete			0
' it has been an amazing journey for me			0
it ’s been a crazy experience and i am very thankful			0
