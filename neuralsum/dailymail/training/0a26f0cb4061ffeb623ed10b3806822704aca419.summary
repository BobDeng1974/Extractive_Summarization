a transgender woman has had more than 100 black - market injections to achieve her 60 - inch bum - despite her friends dying due to similar operations			1
@entity5 , 42 , has spent £ 60,000 sculpting her body over the past 20 years - including injections that have filled each bum cheek with a incredible 8lb of silicone			1
she said that similar high - risk illegal operations have maimed and killed a number of her friends , but that she has no regrets over her extensive plastic surgery			1
she said : ' going to the black market is a big risk			1
people can die from these injections			2
' ' i 've seen people eaten up by the silicone			1
i 've seen them turn black - and - blue and not being able to walk anymore			1
' i 've seen people have their whole breast taken off			2
' it 's cheaper on the black market and people are willing to take the risks to achieve the beauty			2
' i 'm one of the lucky ones and i knock on wood everyday thanking @entity48 that he brought me through			0
' illegal silicone injections often use non-surgical silicone - sometimes bought from hardware stores - that can lead to severe infections that result in deformations , amputations and even death			1
but ms @entity5 said that many people take the risk to follow in the footsteps of curvy celebrities			1
she said : ' i love @entity61 's body - it 's beautiful			2
she 's exactly what a woman should be			0
' when it comes to me and celebrities , a lot of people compare me to @entity69			2
extensive surgeries : as well as silicone injections , ms @entity5 , pictured with dr @entity73 , has had breast enhancements , chin implants , facial fillers and laser treatment ' it makes me laugh because i 'm thinking , ' i had a * * before i even knew of @entity69 or before she was even around '			1
' maybe @entity69 's actually got an a * * like me			0
' ms @entity5 , who was born @entity79 , said she has always lived an unorthodox lifestyle but that her family have been supportive from the beginning			1
she knew she was attracted to men from a young age before deciding to start living as a woman in her late teens			0
she said : ' my childhood was loving and respectful and so i was able to grow up into a positive and productive individual			0
' i did n't have the same hang - ups as some of the people in the transgender community who were ostracised by family members			2
significant change : ms @entity5 said that the risk of black - market surgeries has been worth it in order to achieve a curvier figure like those of celebrities @entity61 and @entity69 ' my family let me be who i wanted to be , so it gave me the opportunity to produce a beautiful woman with no hang - ups , mentally			1
' ms @entity5 first began her transition with hormone therapy , which helped her develop hips , breasts and a more feminine appearance			1
but determined to be a ' body goddess ' , she was soon tempted by the quick - fix promises of backstreet surgery			2
she said : ' it 's pretty much word of mouth			0
people will go up to someone and say , " i like your body , where did you get it done ? " ' it 's really not hard to find			0
if you get into the right area , you 'll pretty much find someone who is doing it			0
supported : ms @entity5 ( pictured aged 14 , left , and aged 16 , right ) , who was born @entity79 , said she has always lived an unorthodox lifestyle but that her family have been supportive from the beginning ' i do n't have a single friend who has n't had something done			1
' i 've had countless surgeries			2
i got my injections done by three people			0
i wo n't say their names , but i went to @entity141 in @entity142 for some procedures and the rest were done here in @entity23 , @entity24			0
' ms @entity5 saved up for breast enhancements , chin implants , facial fillers and laser surgery			1
but most of her money was spent on injections into her buttocks , which she would pay for every few months			2
she said : ' before the surgery my butt was about 25 inches - now it is more like 60 inches			2
' it 's hard to say how many injections i had - after a while you start to lose count			2
' but i would have to say it must be something in the region of over a hundred ... at least			0
' happiest she has ever been : ms @entity5 said that she has accepted she may one day pay a price for her curves but , for now , is determined to enjoy the life it has given her ms @entity5 said that she was once hospitalised for two weeks when a backstreet surgeon punctured her lung with a needle during a breast enhancement			1
she now claims to live a life of luxury with her body attracting enough admirers to allow her to become a ' kept woman '			0
she said : ' with a body like this , you pretty much get whatever you want			0
men tend to put me up on a pedestal and treat me like a queen			0
' i 'm not in a relationship but if i find the right man i 'll go with it			0
but it 's not that important to me			0
' despite having her pick of the men , @entity5 is often hurt by the frosty reception she gets from ' natural women ' who are eager to dismiss her beauty			1
' a lot of them ca n't accept a beautiful transgender woman , ' she said			0
' if you are a transvestite , a drag - queen or someone 's that 's playing around , they will receive you better			2
but if you 're able to stand next to them and look just like them - or better - then it 's different			2
' it takes a strong woman to stand next to a transsexual woman like myself and not feel intimidated			0
' in demand : ms @entity5 claimed that her surgeries mean that her body attracts enough admirers that she can live a life of luxury as a ' kept woman ' , but said that ' natural women ' find her beauty intimidating one of ms @entity5 ' friends , @entity220 , 39 , said that others are now getting surgery to emulate ms @entity5 ' figure			1
she said : ' there is so much botched - up work going on out there			2
they want to copy @entity5 's look but end up looking rippled , dragging and sagging - it 's ridiculous			1
' ms @entity5 has recently been assessed by leading plastic surgeon dr @entity73 , who admits he is ' stunned ' that she has had no issues with her black - market booty			1
he said : ' @entity5 's shape is relatively good if you like the very , very big buttock look			1
' she must have had three or four thousand cc 's of product , that 's about 8 pounds , into each buttock			0
' to me that 's unbelievable			0
i have no clue how she has not had a problem			0
' she falls into the one or two per cent of people who have not had problems yet			0
lucky : plastic surgeon dr @entity73 , pictured with ms @entity5 , said that she has been very fortunate not to have suffered any medical complications as a result of her surgeries ' but the question is , what happens further down the road ? ' when issues do flare up dr @entity73 said that it usually begins with discolouration of the skin near the injection point			1
this can then become inflamed , with itching and hardening			0
when the fat cells start to die , ulcers begin forming in the tissue			0
this can result in complete disfigurement as the filler spreads through the body			0
dr @entity73 said many victims end up ' medical cripples ' and often it is too late to help them as the non-surgical silicone spreads throughout the body - rather than stay contained like an implant			1
coveted : ms @entity5 ' friend @entity220 , 39 , pictured together , said that others are now getting surgery - often illegal - in order to emulate ms @entity5 ' figure he added : ' even though @entity5 has not had any issues up to this point , i would urge people never , ever use these injections in your body			1
' ms @entity5 said that she has accepted she may one day pay a price for her curves but , for now , is determined to enjoy the life it has given her			1
she said : ' it 's been 20 plus years now and i 'll accept whatever comes of it in the future , ' she said			1
' i do n't recommend people copy what i did - but i 'm a risk taker and it has been a success			1
' i 'm in the body i have created and enjoying the lifestyle it has afforded me			0
' i have no regrets about being the beautiful woman i am			0
