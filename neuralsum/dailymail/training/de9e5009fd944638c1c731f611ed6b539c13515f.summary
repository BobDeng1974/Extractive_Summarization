i do n't think i need to use the populist modern phrase ' spoiler alert ' here when i point out that as far as the @entity4 telly audience is concerned , the sports personality of 2014 was @entity5			1
although , now i mention it , i wonder if these are also the actual words that flash up on his dashboard when he has a problem with part of the bodywork on his @entity14 ? but i digress			2
because the point is , as far as the people who perhaps favour @entity22 are concerned , their man who wears the crown of the top sport celebrity of this year is in fact a former superbike racer from @entity25			1
@entity5 ( left ) celebrates his award from the @entity4 while @entity27 ( right ) won i 'm a celebrity @entity28 was one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time in his heyday @entity5 won the @entity33 title this season , beating his @entity14 team - mate @entity35 to the championship @entity27 was the king of the jungle on i 'm a celebrity , which came as a bit of a surprise to many			1
not least of which , @entity27 himself			2
and no doubt a few tv channels and production companies have @entity45 lined up to be the next @entity46			2
@entity27 , in fact , expressed his incredulity with a rather colourful speech at the @entity50			2
especially , as he pointed out , he 'd managed to get through an entire title - laden career without anyone noticing			2
and it is true that as far as high profile telly is concerned , four wheels are most definitely better than two			2
but it was n't always necessarily that way			0
as the first man profiled in the new series of @entity61 on @entity62 on sunday evening , proved			1
indeed , of the six legends featured in the programmes , @entity63 is the only man who did it with the engine clamped between his thighs			1
for this episode , @entity69 aka @entity69 does the honours as the celebrity host charged with bringing his hero back to life			0
@entity69 has a great track record profiling the likes of pirates and murderers in documentaries , but sportsmen has never really seemed part of his brief			0
but this is what @entity63 was all about ; exceeding his sporting boundaries			1
or as @entity69 puts it so eloquently himself , @entity63 was a ' 200 miles per hour pop star '			1
obviously with a man like @entity69 at the helm , this was never going to be a story told through a furrow - browed stare			0
@entity69 on the @entity62 show @entity61 ( left ) and @entity63 with @entity33 star @entity92 in 1977 but to think he was n't taking it seriously would be to underestimate @entity69 's commitment to the @entity63 cause			1
which , as we discover , goes all the way back to his teen years when he , with his dad who had raced @entity101 in the @entity102 , first saw the youthful @entity63 in action at @entity104 , near the @entity69 's home in @entity106			1
and @entity104 is where the programme culminates , with our slightly nervous , but excited host taking @entity63 's famous championship - winning bike for its first spin since 1977			1
in between that , though , is a mixture of interviews and excellent archive material that reminded us of just what impact @entity63 had , in particular during his championship years in the mid-seventies			1
by then he had his long - time partner @entity122 as part of his team			0
and @entity125 here perfectly describes this handsome couple as ' the first @entity127 and @entity128 - they epitomized the decade '			0
@entity69 chats convivially with @entity122 in the film			0
as he also does with @entity63 's sister @entity130 , former fellow rider @entity131 and mechanic @entity132			1
and they all freely give a personal in sight into a man who they all knew believed in his talent , worked at it with a sense of destiny and would enlist any one or do anything to realise it			0
' he was incredibly demanding			0
some days i hated him , ' recalls @entity132 of the man for whom he built the machine that @entity69 says ' was born out of obsession '			0
@entity63 was a world champion and raced for almost 20 years before retiring in 1984 @entity63 married glamour model @entity122 and went on to have two children with her but @entity132 also freely admits it could n't have been , and he would n't have had it , any other way			1
a point perfectly reiterated by his then nemesis on the track , the great @entity155			0
' i got up every day to beat @entity63 , ' he tells us			1
and clearly it was a rivalry that was fuelled by both an unswerving will to win and total , mutual respect			0
the footage of @entity155 and @entity63 going at it is epic			1
just as the shots of him crashing and recuperating are shocking and compelling			0
but equally as revealing are the home movie images of this good - looking young fella who liked playing to the camera - from a schoolboy with his family to the teenaged novice with an impressive mod haircut and his first @entity172 racing bike			0
something that @entity69 also got to ride and which he describes as ' a thing of charm and beauty ' that also happens to send ' vibrations up through your hands and into your mind '			0
but the main event was @entity69 on @entity63 's @entity182 back at @entity104			1
a challenge that he not only took on in @entity63 's colours , but also with @entity63 's son @entity185 looking on and seeing the bike working for the first time ever			2
@entity69 's face when he completed his lap told the story in itself			0
it summed up perfectly what @entity63 had meant to him back in his youth , and the champion 's hay day			1
earlier on in the documentary @entity69 describes @entity63 as someone who was ' in his sister 's mags ( and ) on his mum and dad 's chat shows '			2
which sums up perfectly just what an impact this brilliant , maverick rider had back then			0
sports personality and i 'm a celebrity all rolled into one .			0
