@entity0 could not inspire @entity1 to a comeback victory over @entity3 on sunday when he was introduced at half - time for @entity5 , and was denied his first @entity7 goal for the club by an array of spectacular @entity10 saves			1
@entity1 trailed 2 - 0 at the interval and went on to lose 3 - 0 at @entity12 through goals from @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 but the away side had found moments of attacking joy against @entity3 's defence prior to @entity0 coming on			1
and he was unfortunate not to halve @entity1 's deficit when he blasted a pass from @entity23 goalwards from ten yards , only for @entity24 to brilliantly tip it onto the crossbar on 68 minutes			0
@entity0 ( left ) shoots at goal after meeting a ball across goal from team - mate @entity23 but @entity10 ( left ) made a spectacular save to deny @entity0 his first @entity7 goal for @entity1 @entity0 ( right ) fired a free kick into the wall shortly after being introduced for @entity5 and @entity24 denied him again on 82 , when @entity0 swivelled and shot low after receiving the ball from @entity33 , only for the @entity35 goalkeeper to dive low to his right and claim the ball			1
but @entity0 's duel with @entity24 had not finished			0
moments later , he steered the ball goalwards again from a low ball into the @entity3 area , only for @entity24 to smother any sight of the target the former @entity44 man had			0
@entity0 ( right ) should have been booked for a pulling down @entity16 ( left ) on 52 minutes @entity0 ( left ) was eventually booked for bringing down defender @entity45 in the 72nd minute @entity0 tried to test @entity24 with an acrobatic kick but was unable to connect properly with the bal the @entity49 international had been lucky to escape a yellow card for hauling down @entity51 on 52 minutes , and was booked for the same thing involving @entity45 twenty minutes later			0
had the @entity1 man seen yellow from referee @entity54 for bringing down @entity51 , who had rifled in @entity3 's third a minute before the incident involving @entity45 , @entity0 would have almost definitely been sent - off for fouling the defender .			2

@entity10 tipped a fierce shot from @entity0 onto the crossbar
@entity0 denied twice more looking for first @entity1 @entity7 goal
@entity1 were already trailing 2 - 0 when @entity0 came on and lost 3 - 0
