jailed : @entity0 , 22 , gatecrashed the race at the famous track in @entity3 with his girlfriend and a friend on board as passengers a joyrider who drove his girlfriend 's @entity10 on to the @entity13 circuit during a race was today jailed for eight months			1
@entity0 , 22 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , gatecrashed the @entity18 endurance race at the famous track near @entity20 in @entity3 with his girlfriend and a friend on board as passengers			1
the labourer put the lives of racers at danger after being ‘ egged on ’ to drive a full circuit after accessing the track via a pit lane on june 14 , @entity24 heard			1
@entity33 footage which has been viewed more than two million times shows @entity0 ignoring his hysterical girlfriend as she implores him repeatedly to ‘ stop it ’			1
she then tells him that he is ‘ going the wrong way ’ before screaming ‘ @entity0 , oh my @entity42 ! ’ as she realises he is taking the car on to the track to laughter from his backseat passenger			1
she could be heard pleading with @entity43 to get off the track , as specially - adapted @entity46 cars taking part in a four - hour endurance race sped past them at speeds of up to 100mph			1
last month @entity0 pleaded guilty to ‘ causing a nuisance to the public by driving on to the race track at @entity13 whilst an endurance race was in progress ’			1
at the previous hearing , he said it had been ‘ a foolish and immature prank ’ and he ‘ should not have let it go that far ’			0
@entity0 claimed he had been ‘ dared to do it ’ but he was ‘ sorry ’			2
he used a @entity62 litre car which belonged to an 18 - year - old schoolgirl who knew the pair , but did not realise @entity0 would drive it onto the track			1
despite the stunt being slammed as ‘ reckless and stupid ’ by many viewers of the video , @entity0 initially defended his actions on his @entity73 page , insisting he was ‘ proud to be different ’			2
on another facebook page called ‘ @entity43 ’ he boasted it was ‘ quite funny ’ , and he also uploaded videos on his own @entity73 page of him driving a @entity78 and skidding it to leave burning tyre marks on the road			0
the court heard that @entity43 , his girlfriend and his friend paid £ 14 per head to watch the four - hour race as spectators			1
the event involved 26 cars and nearly 80 participants competing in teams , with nearly £ 250,000 paid to the race organisers in competition fees			0
but judge @entity106 said that around three and a half hours into the race , @entity43 ‘ saw an opportunity ’ to get on to the race track			2
‘ with your girlfriend in the front passenger seat and your other friend in the back filming , you drove your girlfriend 's car on to the track , ’ the judge said			2
‘ you drove a full circuit and i have seen the films with sound commentary showing your girlfriend was hysterical and screaming and begging you to stop , and also protesting it was her car			1
’ his girlfriend had to be taken to the on - site medical centre after having a panic attack , while @entity0 came off the track laughing , the judge said			1
' @entity130 ' @entity33 footage shows @entity0 ignoring his hysterical girlfriend as she implores him to ' stop it ' ' inexcusable ' : more than three hours into the race , @entity43 ' saw an opportunity ' to get on to the race track one driver thought the @entity10 was a doctor 's vehicle or a safety car but when it emerged it was a prank , other racers who had paid to compete became upset at their day being ruined			1
in footage shown in court , one driver had to have his release from the pit lane delayed as @entity0 drove the white @entity10 on to the track			1
prosecutor @entity147 said racers were travelling at speeds of 100mph , while @entity0 was behind the wheel of an ordinary road car with no roll cage or fire extinguisher			0
he said : ‘ it was quite clear that ( @entity43 ) put himself and his passengers in danger , and those of drivers on the track who would not have expected a car going considerably slower			0
’ mr @entity147 added : ‘ while racing was resumed after it had been red - flagged , the race was cut short			0
there was evidence that a number of competitors were upset about what happened			0
‘ as far as the impact to @entity18 @entity172 , which organised the race , they lost about 30 minutes , at a cost of around £ 4,200 to them			2
‘ @entity13 are particularly concerned about this being copied , in particular because videos were posted on @entity33			0
‘ as of july last year , when the statements were given , that video had more than 2,300,000 views			0
’ in police interview , @entity0 admitted he had not driven on to the track by accident			2
mr @entity147 said : ‘ he knew he was going down a pit lane and said , in effect , that he was being egged on			1
’ he also told police : ‘ when do you think you get that opportunity ? ’ filmed inside : the judge said @entity0 had ' endangered many lives ' as he branded his actions ' premeditated ' four - hour race : the event at @entity13 involved 26 cars and nearly 80 participants competing in teams defence counsel @entity199 said @entity43 - dressed in a navy suit and patterned tie - ‘ lacks maturity and is easily led ’			2
she said : ‘ the best mitigation is mr @entity0 's very early guilty plea at the preliminary hearing and i would ask your honour to give mr @entity0 full credit for that plea			2
' it also follows full admission to the police			0
it was very fortunate that there were no injuries to the competitors in the race			0
‘ this is not a case of mr @entity0 ignoring requests from marshals to turn around or going through barriers			0
his recklessness was not stopping before he went on to the track			0
’ as he was led away to the cells , @entity0 blew kisses to family and friends in the public gallery			0
@entity229 , chief executive of @entity230 , the owners of @entity13 , said following the sentencing : ‘ i am really pleased that @entity233 and the court have quite rightly taken such a tough stance on this deliberately reckless act , which endangered the lives of the drivers racing on circuit and the volunteer track marshals , not to mention @entity0 and his passengers			1
‘ his idiotic and selfish behaviour - aggravated by his unrepentant attitude in subsequent media coverage - received much immediate condemnation			0
' his conviction and prison sentence will serve to reinforce the message that this kind of anti-social behaviour is not only stupid , but will lead to prosecution			0
