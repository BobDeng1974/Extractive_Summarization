our galaxy can be a very dusty place , and supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe			1
but up until now , there has been very little direct evidence of a supernova 's dust ‐ making capabilities			1
the little evidence astronomers did have could not account for the massive amount of dust detected in young , distant galaxies			2
now new images of the famed @entity18 have , for the first time , captured the remains of the exploding star brimming with freshly formed dust			1
this artist 's illustration shows @entity18 , based on real data with the cold , inner regions of the exploded star 's remnants ( in red ) where tremendous amounts of dust were detected and imaged			1
this inner region is contrasted with the outer shell ( lacy white and blue circles ) , where the blast wave from the supernova is colliding with the envelope of gas ejected from the star prior to its powerful detonation if enough of this dust makes the perilous transition into interstellar space , it could explain how many galaxies acquired their dusty , dusky appearance			1
‘ we have found a remarkably large dust mass concentrated in the central part of the ejecta from a relatively young and nearby supernova , ’ said @entity47 , an astronomer at the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) in @entity49			2
‘ this is the first time we 've been able to really image where the dust has formed , which is important in understanding the evolution of galaxies			2
’ an international team of astronomers used the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) telescope to observe the glowing remains of @entity18			2
this image shows the remnant of @entity18 in light of very different wavelengths			0
the @entity62 data ( in red ) shows newly formed dust in the centre of the remnant as @entity73 ( in green ) and @entity75 ( in blue ) data show the expanding shock wave in february of 1987 astronomers observing the @entity78 , a nearby dwarf galaxy , noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star			1
in fact they were n’t watching the beginnings of a star but the end of one and the brightest supernova seen from @entity89 in the four centuries since the telescope was invented			1
by the next morning news of the discovery had spread across the globe and southern hemisphere stargazers began watching the aftermath of this enormous stellar explosion , known as a supernova			0
in the two and a half decades since then , the remnant of @entity18 has continued to be a focus for researchers around the world , providing a wealth of information about one of the @entity107 ’s most extreme events			0
located more than 160,000 light years away , the light of the catastrophic explosion only reached @entity89 in february 1987			0
before it exploded , the star generated huge amounts of gas , including a thick , dense , clumpy ring more than a light year across			1
astronomers predicted that as the gas cooled after the explosion , large amounts of dust would form as atoms of oxygen , carbon , and silicon bonded together in the cold central regions of the remnant			2
however , earlier observations of @entity18 with infrared telescopes , made during the first 500 days after the explosion , detected only a small amount of hot dust			2
using , the research team was able to image the far more abundant cold dust , which glows brightly in millimetre and submillimetre light			0
the astronomers estimate that the remnant now contains about 25 per cent the mass of the sun in newly formed dust			1
they also found that significant amounts of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide have formed			0
‘ @entity18 is a special place since it has n't mixed with the surrounding environment , so what we see there was made there , ’ said dr @entity47			0
‘ the new @entity62 results , which are the first of their kind , reveal a supernova remnant chock full of material that simply did not exist a few decades ago			0
’ @entity155 , however , can both create and destroy dust grains			0
as the shockwave from the initial explosion radiated out into space , it produced bright glowing rings of material , as seen in earlier observations with the @entity73			0
after hitting this envelope of gas , which was sloughed off by the progenitor red giant star as it neared the end of its life , a portion of this powerful explosion rebounded back towards the centre of the remnant			0
last year , a team of astronomers led by the @entity174 ( @entity174 ) produced incredible high resolution radio images of the expanding @entity18 remnant at millimetre wavelengths			2
in this image contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a @entity73 image of @entity18 combined to provide a unique view of its death throes @entity186 dust consists of tiny particles of solid material floating around in the space between the stars			1
unlike the dust you find in your house , it is more like smoke with small particles varying from collections of just a few molecules to grains of 0.1 mm in size			0
@entity201 it helps stars form , and it is also the raw material from which planets like the @entity89 are created			1
supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe			1
but up until now , there has been very little direct evidence of a supernova 's dust ‐ making capabilities , and could not account for the massive amount of dust detected in young , distant galaxies			1
‘ at some point , this rebound shockwave will slam into these billowing clumps of freshly minted dust , ’ said dr @entity47			0
‘ it 's likely that some fraction of the dust will be blasted apart at that point			0
it 's hard to predict exactly how much — maybe only a little , possibly a half or two thirds			0
’ if a good fraction survives and makes it into interstellar space , it could account for the copious dust astronomers detect in the early universe			1
‘ really early galaxies are incredibly dusty and this dust plays a major role in the evolution of galaxies , ’ added @entity231 of @entity232 , @entity233			1
‘ today we know dust can be created in several ways , but in the early universe most of it must have come from supernovae			1
we finally have direct evidence to support that theory			1
