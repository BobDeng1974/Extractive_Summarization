had the queen been watching @entity3 ’s defeat to @entity4 she would have been unimpressed by @entity5			1
before the game , knowing that an @entity3 win would boost @entity8 ’s slim chances of advancing from @entity9 , @entity5 tweeted : ‘ if we beat @entity4 i want a kiss , obviously on the cheek , from the @entity14 @entity1			1
' the former @entity15 forward led the @entity17 line brilliantly in their 2 - 1 win over @entity8 on saturday in @entity19 , but he was abject against @entity4 , fluffing two decent chances in the first half and offering little after the break			1
against @entity4 in @entity48 , we saw the player that angered @entity50 at @entity51 and fell out of favour at the @entity53 before being shipped back to the @entity54 to play for @entity55			0
@entity5 barely touched the ball in the opening 20 minutes , as @entity4 defenders @entity58 and @entity27 did a fine job of reading his runs and dispossessing him whenever he looked like threatening			2
in the 31st minute he spurned a great chance to put @entity3 ahead , after racing on to a glorious first - time pass from @entity64			1
@entity5 ’s first touch was heavy which meant he had to stretch to try and prod a lob over @entity38			2
the ball cleared the goalkeeper but drifted some way wide of the left - hand post			0
pass master : @entity3 playmaker @entity64 keeps the ball away from @entity4 forward @entity72 referee ! @entity74 and @entity64 react after @entity5 is fouled last hope : @entity8 needed @entity5 and @entity64 to beat @entity4 to stay in the @entity76 orchestrator : @entity64 set the tempo for @entity3 with a typically commanding midfield performance down but not out : @entity5 picks himself up off the turf with qualification still in @entity3 's hands @entity17 job : @entity64 was trying to secure the @entity3 's place in the knockout stages with victory @entity64 began to dictate the game after a quiet start , but @entity5 undid his good work on a number of occasions by straying offside and giving away free - kicks for committing unnecessary fouls			1
in the 69th minute he received the first booking of the game , for pulling the shirt of @entity27 after an @entity3 move broke down			0
there was no need for it , and it merely disrupted @entity3 ’s flow as they went in search of an equaliser			0
@entity4 , to their credit , were magnificent			0
their high pressing was a risk , but one that spectacularly paid off			0
cottage industry : @entity112 forward @entity72 opened the scoring for @entity4 with a first - half header life of @entity72 : @entity72 celebrates after giving @entity116 a deserved lead against the group favourites gutted : @entity5 and teammates look on dejected after @entity72 scores i 'm taking my ball home ! @entity5 gestures toward @entity58 and @entity125 @entity3 and @entity5 , in particular , failed to make the most of the spaces behind the @entity4 defence , as their full - backs pushed forward to great effect			1
@entity132 , one of the standout performers against @entity8 in @entity19 , was pinned back by left - back @entity134 , and it was the defender ’s enticing cross that led to the only goal of the game			2
@entity134 picked the ball up on the left , bewildered @entity142 , and then sent a brilliant cross to the back post where @entity112 reject @entity72 nodded past an unusually poor @entity74			2
lady in waiting : @entity5 's fiance @entity146 ( @entity147 ) was watching from the stands get shirty ! @entity5 and @entity64 's kits are laid out ahead of the game imposter ! a @entity5 lookalike jokes with a @entity4 fan before the game @entity155 : @entity3 fans show their appreciation for @entity5 before the game belles of the ball : @entity17 lady supporters get into the spirit of things during the game despite scoring just seven times in 76 appearances during his time at @entity169 , @entity72 , who spent last season on loan at @entity173 , only needed one chance to seal a historic win for @entity4			1
he was given a warm round of applause when he departed with 10 minutes to play , having terrorised @entity3 ’s defence alongside @entity181 striker @entity180 , who impressed once again			0
@entity181 have been linked with a summer move for @entity5 , but with @entity180 set to be integrated into the first - team squad at the @entity185 next season , there may be no need .			0

@entity3 were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity4 in @entity9 at the @entity76
result means that @entity8 can not qualify for the knockout stages
@entity5 missed @entity3 's best chance with a lob in the first - half
@entity64 was typically *influential* in midfield but could *n't* prevent loss
@entity112 's @entity72 scored the winner to send @entity4 through
