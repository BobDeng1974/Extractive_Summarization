going to the cinema once or twice a week could hold the key to preventing dementia , researchers claim			0
watching a funny film with a good plot helps to stimulate the brain and prevent the build - up of harmful deposits , they believe			1
crucially , discussing the film with friends afterwards helps to keep the mind active and guards against the formation of the plaques that cause @entity15 ’s			1
in a bid to prove their thesis , academics from @entity17 are launching a study involving 40 elderly patients - half of whom will go to the cinema once or twice a week			1
stock photo they will then have a detailed discussion about the plot , the characters and what they made of the film overall over a cup of coffee or tea afterwards			2
dr @entity40 , who is leading the research , believes this intellectual stimulation can prevent the build - up of toxins in the brain , called @entity46 , which lead to alzheimer ’s disease			1
‘ in order to keep the elimination of these toxins efficient , you need to keep the walls of the blood vessels healthy , ’ she said			0
‘ you can do this by exercising of the brain or stimulation			2
‘ the films will stimulate the brain because of what you see and hear and crucially because of the discussions afterwards			2
‘ the bottom line is we ’re trying to prevent these toxins accumulating in the brain by keeping the blood vessels pumping and brain active			1
’ dr @entity40 , an associate professor in @entity67 , cited the @entity68 , starring @entity69 and @entity70 , as an ideal film			1
it tells the story of seven pensioners spending their retirement in a hotel in @entity78 @entity77 would easily be able to relate the characters who are not dissimilar in age and it is both funny and intellectually stimulating			0
however , she said sci fi films were not ideal , as patients may lose concentration and find them difficult to believe			0
amyloid plaques start to form as the walls of the blood vessels in the brain start to stiffen and lose their ability to get rid of toxins			2
to prove their thesis , academics from @entity17 are launching a study involving 40 elderly patients and will send half of them to the cinema once or twice a week			1
stock photo some patients have weaker blood vessel walls - possibly due to their genes - and gradually , the toxins build up			1
they create deposits called plaques which damage the surrounding cells and cause @entity15 , the most common form of dementia			2
dr @entity40 ’s study is due to begin this summer and will involve 40 elderly patients who have mild memory and concentration problems , but have not been diagnosed with dementia			1
half will go to the cinema or watch an older film together on a large screen once or twice a week and have a discussion for about an hour afterwards			0
all patients will also undergo memory and concentration assessments once or twice a month to see if the films are improving the function of their brains			0
an estimated 850,000 people in @entity124 have dementia and 1 in 3 of us will develop the illness during our lifetime			0
but drug companies have failed to find a cure despite millions being invested in research over the past few decades			0
last month a major report warned that the search for effective treatments had been hampered by ‘ funding fatigue ’			0
the @entity136 said drugs companies were less willing to pay for trials following a series of expensive failures .			0
