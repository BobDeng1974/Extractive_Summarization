' @entity8 went on to explain how his 7 - year - old sister is severely disabled and relies on his parents for all of her personal care and needs			1

tragically for the family , last august , mum @entity9 was diagnosed with breast cancer			1
' because of this , my family 's whole world has turned upside down , ' @entity8 told us			1
' @entity41 has n't been able to care for my sister like she used to because she has n't had the strength to			1
she has had chemotherapy and she has been really sick and i feel helpless as there is nothing i can do to help her			1
hero : @entity9 had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet , so , explained @entity8 , to meet @entity6 a few days later ( on @entity51 ) would be ' out of this world ' for her - and it really was ' all i want is to see her smile again like she did on her last chemo session and if she met @entity6 , i am sure it would give her the extra strength to carry on			1
' @entity9 had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet , so , explained @entity8 , to meet @entity6 a few days later ( on @entity51 ) would be ' out of this world ' for her			1
he added : ' it 's not fair because my mum always puts other people before herself and she is just a complete inspiration to me			1
' it 's easy for me to say because she 's my mum but i have never known anyone who is so caring and warm - hearted			1
great son : @entity8 says his mother ( pictured , right , at her last chemo session ) is a complete inspiration to him ' i just think mum deserves this so much because @entity6 is what gives mum strength at the moment , let alone if she actually met him			1

it 's given my mum the inspiration to fight cancer and stay positive			1
' a thrilled @entity9 said : ' winning the competition made me think that anything is possible			1

' if you have a hairy back , shave it ; brush your teeth ; fake tan i 'm not so much into			2
not too much hair i guess - i shave everywhere			2
i 'm kidding , i do n't shave everywhere ... but most places you do try to trim			2
' @entity6 likes to keep things fragrant as well as tidy : he reveals he is coming out with a new fragrance for men called @entity120 - a completely new venture for him			2
' i never thought i would say this but i was pretty involved in it , i wear it myself and i like it			2
' it has a woody kind of smell to it			2
i just went with my other favourites that i would wear in the past and combined them and said " this is the direction i want to take it in "			0
it 's going to come out towards the end of the year			0
' looking - and smelling - good is a priority for the star , who claims that since he 's turned 30 keeping in shape has n't been as easy			0
@entity6 , pictured earlier this month , says he prefers performing to burn calories rather than the gym ' one of the things i 've noticed , when you turn 30 and up , you 've got ta watch a little bit more what you eat			0
but in my case going on tour , two hours on stage , you actually lose a lot of calories which is good			0
i notice when i 'm not on tour i 'm not in as good shape			0
it helps me like a workout			0
' when it comes down to the gym or anything that 's cardio , like running on the treadmill , i 'm very lazy			0
what i like to do more is sports			0
whether it 's surfing or paying racquetball with my friends , you sweat a lot and i like that better			0
' and talking of getting sweaty ... we had to grill him about his chat - up lines			0
' my lines tend to be kind of stupid and immature , ' he says			0
' if a girl can laugh at a joke then i always think that 's cool			0
that 's fun , it 's a good opener			0
' and when it comes to dating , he likes to prepare things in advance but does n't like anything too loud or fancy			0
' i like dinner and a movie , and places that are not very loud			0
' ' my lines tend to be kind of stupid and immature			0
if a girl can laugh at a joke then i always think that 's cool ' the craving for simplicity is reflected in the title of his latest album , @entity103 and @entity191			0
' @entity193 is the first title i thought of when i listened to the album , ' he says			0
' a lot of times i thought , " maybe it 's too simple , too straightforward " , but every time i thought of a new title kept coming back to @entity103			0
' it 's something we can all relate to			0
