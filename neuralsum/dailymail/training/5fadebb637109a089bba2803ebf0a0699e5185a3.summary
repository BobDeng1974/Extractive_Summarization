he almost lost his balance when he sat down at the start and briefly lost his composure when someone dropped the f - word but , the subject of @entity8 aside , this felt like a happy homecoming for @entity10			1
not always everyone ’s cup of tea during a @entity15 career spent at @entity16 and @entity17 , @entity10 returned to @entity18 for the first time as a @entity21 player on monday and was quite the charmer			1
there were no hard feelings towards @entity17 for ending his eight - year stay at @entity26 this summer and an acceptance that @entity28 has yet to see the best of him			1
@entity10 said an emotional farewell to @entity17 fans at @entity26 in may @entity10 was released by @entity17 at the end of last season following eight years with the @entity35 @entity10 was speaking to the press ahead of tuesday night 's game at the @entity38 there were even a few wisecracks			1
when a question was put jointly to him and @entity42 , @entity10 waited for the @entity21 coach to finish a long - winded answer in @entity28 before saying : ‘ i agree with him ! ’ for @entity17 fans who are still coming to terms with seeing @entity48 playing — and scoring — against his old club , it will feel even more peculiar to consider the possibility of two of their 2012 @entity54 heroes facing one another with different clubs at the @entity38 on tuesday night			1
asked if he was surprised to see @entity48 score four goals in three games for @entity59 , @entity10 said : ‘ not really			1
i think everyone knows what @entity48 brings to every team			1
‘ it ’s another experienced player for @entity59 and he brings goals			1
he scored one against @entity17			2
he probably did n’t like that but he ’s paid to do a job			2
@entity10 could come up against former @entity17 teammate @entity48 ‘ it will be nice to see him but i never expected to play against him			1
i do n’t think @entity17 were wrong ( to let them both go )			0
a decision was made and i ’m fine with it			0
i had eight great years there and i still speak to the staff and players			2
‘ i ’m not playing that well			0
i wo n’t get carried away			0
i ’m enjoying my football and hopefully i can emulate what i achieved at @entity16 and @entity17			0
’ @entity10 will be the most experienced @entity54 player on the pitch with 105 appearances , three more than @entity48			1
but he was left out of the 5 - 1 win over @entity79 in the opening group e fixture , as well as one of five consecutive @entity83 victories			0
one criticism is that he does not get forward from left - back as much as he used to			2
‘ that ’s because i ’m old ! ’ said the 33 - year - old			0
‘ when i get used to the league and the way we play , i ’ll attack a bit more			0
@entity10 has endured a slow start to his @entity21 career ‘ i ’m loving @entity28 , to be honest			1
of course it ’s different to the @entity15 which is fast and furious			0
@entity83 is slower , though we like to attack and play fast			0
‘ i loved playing in the @entity15 , but this is something different for me now			0
’ the @entity28 know that @entity59 ’s last - minute defeat to @entity98 has put more pressure on the @entity15 champions to win tonight			1
victory for @entity21 , meanwhile , would put them in a commanding position in the group after just two games			1
‘ of course it will make it more difficult for them to qualify , ’ said @entity10			1
‘ we do n’t want to think that far ahead but it will make it hard for them to catch up certainly and put us top of the group			0
@entity10 arrives in @entity18 for tuesday night 's @entity54 clash against @entity59 @entity10 has featured four times for @entity21 since his arrival in @entity28 in the summer ‘ it ’s a new experience for some of our players but we ’re confident that we can challenge the top teams , come to @entity59 , play well and maybe do n’t lose the game — that ’s the main thing			1
i think everyone knows how good @entity59 are now			2
they have been champions twice			0
they have ( @entity126 ) @entity125 , ( @entity128 ) @entity127 , ( @entity130 ) @entity129 , ( @entity131 ) @entity132 and then they sign @entity48			2
‘ these players are known worldwide because they win things			0
they have won the @entity15 and now they will be aiming to win the @entity54 as well			0
‘ but there is pressure on them			0
they have big players and i know some of them — @entity132 and ( @entity140 ) @entity139 and @entity48 — will always want to keep on winning , but there ’s less pressure on us			2
