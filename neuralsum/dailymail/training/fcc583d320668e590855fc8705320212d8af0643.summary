@entity0 , 26 , from @entity1 had at least 50 one night stands because she was drunk every mother hopes for , yet in equal measure dreads , the day her eldest child leaves home to start university			1
as @entity7 hugged 20 - year - old @entity8 goodbye on the doorstep of her new student digs in @entity11 , she desperately tried to mask her tears with a smile			1
these exciting new beginnings would mark the next chapter in her daughter ’s life — it was her duty as a mother to let go			0
back home , in their empty nest in @entity23 , near @entity1 , she and her husband @entity20 , 61 , a graphic designer , were consoled by the fact that @entity8 ’s photography course would launch her into a rewarding career			1
but what @entity7 , 51 , a director of an international charity , could not have anticipated was that @entity8 ’s arrival at university would precipitate her downward spiral into a dangerous world of alcohol dependency , leaving her deep in debt and vulnerable to sexual predators			1
while stories of students drinking to excess are nothing new , @entity8 ’s tale will horrify any mother of daughters			1
and never more so than at this time of year , as drink - fuelled freshers ’ weeks across @entity45 seduce a new cohort of wide - eyed students with a seemingly endless supply of cheap alcohol			2
before her first term at @entity52 was out , @entity8 had developed the beginnings of such a serious drink problem that she swapped lectures for sessions at @entity58 ( @entity58 ) , before dropping out of university altogether			1
‘ it sickens me to admit that i must have had at least 50 one - night stands — and they ’re the ones that i am aware of — all because i was too drunk to care , ’ she says			1
too drunk to bother with contraception , @entity8 realises she was very lucky not to get pregnant , or contract a sexually transmitted infection			1
and , having repeatedly put herself in vulnerable positions , she is also aware she ’s lucky to be alive			0
now 26 , @entity8 says her problems began when , as a shy student , she took advantage of the cheap booze laid on to lubricate those awkward early social interactions			1
when , two months into her university career , @entity8 called home in tears , her parents were horrified			1
‘ she had six weeks of term to go , but had already blown her entire student maintenance loan — around £ 1,600 — and was a further £ 1,000 overdrawn , ’ @entity7 says			1
‘ it emerged that all of it had gone on drink			0
’ at her parents ’ insistence , @entity8 caught a train home within the hour			1
later that evening , the full extent of her drinking became clear			0
‘ we worked out she was drinking around 240 units a week , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ more than 15 times the recommended limit			0
’ @entity91 's mother @entity7 , 51 , had to step in to help her daughter who found there was no support at university when she went back to university after christmas 2008 , her parents took control of her finances , opening a bank account in @entity7 ’s name and transferring £ 30 a week for food			1
but , unbeknown to them , @entity8 spent the money on alcohol			1
she was also so adept at getting others to buy drinks for her that controlling her money made little difference			0
‘ some clubs sold pints for 50p , and my friends and i could easily share a litre of vodka before going out , ’ she says			0
‘ i regularly had blackouts , where i could barely remember arriving at a club let alone leaving it			0
@entity116 's alcohol habit had got so bad that she would regularly black out on a night out with friends ‘ once , apparently , i even went around a late - night kebab shop asking men to go home with me			1
fortunately , one guy , a total stranger , realised the state i was in and took me to my shared house			0
’ for @entity7 , it was a terrifying time			0
though @entity8 kept many of the most shameful incidents to herself , she would often phone home , full of self - loathing and distraught about her drinking			1
with her parents ’ encouragement , she began attending aa meetings , but felt out of place in the group of mainly men , meeting secretly in dark church halls			1
she longed to find others in a similar situation to herself : young women , new to alcohol and struggling to cope			1
@entity140 , director of campaigns at @entity142 , says : ‘ it ’s not easy for young people to work out how to deal with alcohol			2
they ’re bombarded with alcohol advertising , which tells them drinking is a normal thing to do , and it ’s often available at unscrupulously low prices			2
one in six children report being given alcohol by their parents aged just 12 or 13 ‘ young people also tend to overestimate how much their peers drink , which can cause a feeling that “ everyone is doing it ”			2
’ indeed , research conducted by @entity160 and the @entity161 claims many 18 to 24 - year - olds think it is socially unacceptable not to drink alcohol , and one in five young adults say peer pressure influences them to drink more than they might wish			2
further evidence suggests that those who drink heavily in their teens and early 20s are up to twice as likely as light drinkers to still be binge - drinking 25 years later			0
@entity170 , 28 , is certain it was her arrival at @entity172 ten years ago , to study @entity174 literature , that sparked her lack of boundaries around alcohol			1
‘ nothing prepared me for the student alcohol culture , ’ she says			2
‘ aged 18 , i ’d barely drunk before and , suddenly , was seeing boozed - up girls getting naked in pubs and boys urinating into shoes in the middle of the afternoon			2
the student regularly drank 30 units a night in an effort to be the life and soul of the party ‘ everyone was drinking			1
if you did n’t join in , you got left behind			0
i was n’t drinking to escape problems — i did n’t have any — it was just about trying to fit in			0
’ keen to be the ‘ life and soul ’ , @entity116 was soon drinking up to 10 units a night , four days a week			1
‘ as my tolerance grew , i would down a bottle of wine before going out			0
there were ambulances outside clubs before anyone arrived : they knew the state we ’d get into			0
’ after three years at university , @entity116 ’s drinking was getting progressively worse			2
‘ i used to black out a lot , and ended up stranded at parties in the middle of nowhere , with no money to get home			0
i ’d wake up from one - night stands , not knowing where i was or who with			2
in two months , i put on 2 st because of the alcohol			2
’ somehow , @entity116 ’s grades did n’t slip			0
after graduating , she enrolled on a drama course			0
‘ by then , i was so used to drinking , i thought it was normal to turn up to 8am classes still drunk			1
it was almost a badge of honour			0
’ but , when she began experiencing stomach cramps , panic attacks and depression a year after graduating , she knew that she needed help			0
@entity116 says her tolerance of alcohol increased ‘ i joined a 12 - step addiction recovery programme and went to therapy and started looking at the reasons i was drinking so much in the first place - because i did n't value and respect myself			1
' i started to drink less , do exercise and eat more healthily , which meant that i no longer needed to turn to booze to escape from my problems and lack of self - worth			2
' now , @entity116 jointly runs a support group for young women called @entity243			1
it 's aimed at young women who struggle with addictive behaviours , inspiring them to make healthier lifestyle choices			2
she has now learned to ‘ drink like a grown - up , not a student ' , and is much happier as a result			0
last year , concerned headteachers wrote to universities to warn them they are failing in their duty of care to students by ignoring the binge - drinking culture amongst young people studying away from home for the first time			0
@entity140 says the blame can not be laid solely with universities : ‘ if we ’re to change the student drinking culture , we need bars and retailers to act responsibly , and this means not trying to hook them in with irresponsible price promotions			0
‘ we need the government to act and introduce a minimum unit price , which would cover student bars and help prevent students bulk - buying cheap alcohol to “ pre-load ” at home before going out			2
’ @entity7 believes the combination of cheap alcohol and student loans can prove lethal , when combined with a first taste of independence			0
although she did n’t finish her course , with family support , @entity8 stopped drinking , of her own volition , in june 2011			1
horrified by the lack of age - appropriate support , @entity7 has now left her job to set up a charity with @entity8 to plug that gap			1
wash my pink jumper ( a code phrase @entity8 would use on the phone to her mum while at university to show she needed help , without losing face in front of her friends ) offers a helpline and weekly meetings for young women			1
‘ drinking is not always black and white			0
it is not always about being an alcoholic or not , ’ @entity7 says			0
‘ we support young women , and parents who are worried about them			1
i do n’t want any mother to feel how i felt			0
’ for @entity8 , the charity has been a lifeline : ‘ to know i got through that awful time and can help others do the same gives me purpose			2
i feel horrified at what i did , what i put everyone through			0
‘ i was lucky to have such a strong , supportive family — in many ways , the charity aims to replicate that for other girls who are not so fortunate			0
