lord @entity0 today warned disabled people could be put under pressure to ‘ do the right thing ’ and end their lives if the law is changed to allow the right to die			1
in a moving speech , the former @entity9 chairman revealed his wife – paralysed by the @entity12 – had once told him ‘ you ’d be better off without me ’			1
he said the comment illustrated the way in which a change to the law would put countless people under pressure to end their lives for the sake of their families			1
the proposed legislation would allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally - ill patients judged to have six months or less to live who request it			2
it was given an unopposed second reading in july after a marathon 10 - hour debate featuring nearly 130 speeches both for and against the move			0
@entity44 , the former archbishop of @entity45 , was one of those voting in favour – even though he has previously opposed the move			0
in a debate today , @entity0 said there needed to be changes so that there was some ‘ deterrence against wrongdoing ’ – to stop people putting pressure on people to end their lives			1
‘ supposing there is wrongdoing , how do we deter it ? at the moment , if somebody wrongfully puts pressure on , or wrongfully assists , a suicide , they know that the law is there and that its hand may fall on their shoulder			1
an @entity73 bomb ripped through the @entity74 in @entity12 in 1984 , killing five people and injuring 31 ‘ i may be wrong but , as i see it , if we enacted these measures we would only be adding to the procedures , not to the deterrents against wrongdoing			1
’ he said his wife @entity22 had been in constant pain for the last 30 years , since she was injured in the 1984 ira @entity12 bombing , and the pain was getting worse			1
‘ i fear for the day when she will say again to me what she said to me a little while ago : “ you know , you would be better off without me ”			2
‘ there are many ways in which pressure can be brought to bear to make people who are perhaps approaching the end of their lives — although i hope that my wife is not — to “ do the decent thing ”			1
‘ these amendments do not do anything to avoid that , and that is what worries me			2
’ @entity0 said that unless there was deterrence , some people would do wrong – something he said had happened with abortion because doctors who pre-sign forms are never punished although it is against the law			1
‘ a number of doctors , quite wrongfully , signed chits , or whatever they are called , to allow sex - selective and frequently late abortion of patients whom they had never seen and whose names they did not know , have gone unpunished , ’ he said			1
‘ where is the deterrence to that ? ’ peers were given extra time to make progress on a controversial backbench @entity123 giving some terminally - ill patients the right to die			1
some 170 amendments to the legislation had been lain down			2
with only limited parliamentary time available for private members ' legislation , supporters fear the amendments could scupper its chances			2
opinion outside @entity136 is sharply divided , with disability campaigners voicing concern today about the attempt to change the law on assisted dying , while supporters of change claimed opponents were determined to ‘ strangle ’ the legislation			1
@entity0 , who was a cabinet minister at the time of the attack , was photographed being carried from the wreckage of the blast 30 years ago @entity151 's @entity150 said there were people who ' desperately want out '			0
despite being ill for 31 years , such a course of action had not crossed his mind			0
' but one day it may cross my mind and i want that right - and i do n't want the courts to interfere in it , ’ he said			0
fertility expert and @entity151 peer @entity163 said that with increasing numbers of distressed elderly people in hospital , it was vital to have the safeguards in @entity171 's amendment to protect society			2
' it is essential we have some kind of legal process which ensures that this @entity123 is properly policed , ' he said			0
' it can not be left to the medical and nursing profession to make their minds up			0
' justice minister @entity182 said the issue was for @entity136 to decide			0
the government was taking a ' neutral ' position and would allow a free vote if any of the amendments was pressed to a division			0
@entity30 said he agreed that the decision should not be left to doctors alone and that there was a place for judges to provide confidence in the proposed system			0
' in principle , i think although it may deter some people , ultimately it will give greater protection , ' he said			0
' i accept ... there needs to be some degree of judicial oversight			0
' @entity204 backed an amendment adding judicial safeguards to the legislation			0
under the change a high court judge of the family division would have to be satisfied that the person seeking the right to die had a ' voluntary , clear , settled and informed wish to end ' their life .			2
