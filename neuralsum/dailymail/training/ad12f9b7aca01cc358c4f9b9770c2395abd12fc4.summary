if you move at a snail 's pace , you have more time than most to admire the wonders of nature			2
and this snail seemed entranced by what must have seemed a vast bubble that it encountered in a tiny puddle on a @entity11 country lane			1
these beautiful close - up images show the snail peering at the bubble and then plunging its head through it			1
the snail 's reflection appears in the gleaming surface of the bubble that was floating in a @entity11 puddle what happens if i push it ? the intrigued snail gently touches the surface of the glistening bubble taken by dental technician @entity28 , 48 , near his home city of @entity30 in northern @entity11 , they show the mollusc utterly captivated by the gleaming bubble			1
mr @entity28 , who enjoys photographing wildlife in his spare time , said : ' it started a long time ago , my father was a school art teacher			2
' he loved to gather mushrooms in the forest , and he started to take me with him when i was six years old			0
' as a result , nature became a huge part of my life from a very early age , and i also inherited my father 's passion for photography			0
perched over the puddle on a tiny twig , the snail was in no hurry as it prodded the bubble from every angle i 'm in ! the snail forces its head into the bubble in a stunning image by dental technician @entity28 ' i began to focus on macro ( extremely close - up ) photography around 20 years ago , and snails are amongst my favourite things to photograph			1
' they 're fascinating creatures but the main reason i like to take pictures of snails is because they move so slowly there 's no danger of them running off while i 'm trying to take a picture			0
' i think i could have published a book of images , i have photographed snails so much			0
' but these pictures are the ones that make me smile			0
