by @entity0 @entity3 match - winner @entity1 admitted the @entity4 were a difficult team to breakdown after edging to a 1 - 0 victory in a rainswept @entity8			1
the @entity10 midfielder took his overall tally of @entity13 goals to nine in the same number of appearances with strike number four in @entity17			2
that was enough to earn @entity3 top spot in @entity20 , and a trip to @entity22 on tuesday to meet the side who finish second in @entity25 only goal : @entity1 's strike was enough to give @entity3 the victory is a hard - fought match breakthrough : @entity1 celebrates his ' bright idea ' which ensured @entity3 finished top of @entity20 ' we were dominant , ' said @entity1			1
' all the @entity34 did was sit back deep in their own half , and when that happens , it just becomes a patience game			0
' but sometimes even i manage to have a bright idea - i spend the whole day training like i 'm obsessed anyway			0
' that idea was a pinpoint low strike from the edge of the penalty area which decided thursday 's clash in @entity3 's favour			1
' it was an okay game from us , ' added @entity1			0
' we may only have won it 1 - 0 , but we can take that too			1
' only in stoppage time did @entity52 's men come close to breaching the @entity3 defence , but @entity55 stepped in to block @entity57 's effort			2
it was an otherwise quiet day at the office for the @entity3 rearguard			0
on the slide : @entity55 blocks @entity57 's shot in the best opening that the @entity34 created frustration : fans in @entity65 can not believe their eyes as the @entity34 fall behind to @entity3 ' soccer ' fans : @entity34 were well supported both at home in the @entity34 and at the stadium in @entity17 ' we had the match under control for most of it today , ' said @entity77 defender @entity76 - one of only two players in @entity79 's starting @entity80 , with @entity82 's @entity81 , not to come from @entity10 or @entity83			1
' we kept our concentration well , even if it was n't really a sensational performance			2
' but then no game at this @entity13 is easy and this was n't one we could take for granted today			2
' @entity52 could not hide a grin at the final whistle either			0
the result gave him double cause for celebration as the @entity34 joined his native @entity3 in the last 16			0
satisfaction : @entity52 was animated during the game but able to smile after as both sides progressed keeping calm : @entity79 's side had to be patient but eventually secured the win against the @entity34 ' we created too few chances , but it 's still fantastic to go through , ' said the man who led @entity3 to third place at the @entity13 in 2006 before stepping aside to let @entity79 take over			1
' everybody said we had no chance , but we 've taken it and we 're now in the last 16			0

@entity1 's strike the only goal in @entity3 's 1 - 0 win against @entity4
