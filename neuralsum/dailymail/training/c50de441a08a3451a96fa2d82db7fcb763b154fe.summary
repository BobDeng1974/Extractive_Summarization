@entity1 firebrand @entity0 is rarely at a loss for words but became unmoored on saturday in @entity4 after her teleprompter froze and left her without portions of her prepared speech			1
the 2008 @entity1 vice presidential nominee flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of one - liners – and some of them made little sense			1
' the man can only ride you when your back is bent , ' she said , as audience members looked at each other quizzically			1
' so strengthen it ! then the man ca n't ride you , @entity22 wo n't get taken for a ride , because so much is at stake			1
' what will they do to stop causing our pain , and start feeling it again ? well , in other words , um – is @entity62 a new @entity63 or an old one ? ' ' now the press asks , the press asks , " can anyone stop @entity62 ? " again , this is to forego a conclusion , right ? it 's to scare us off , to convince us that – a pantsuit can crush patriots ? ' @entity74 communications director @entity73 issued a terse reaction to the @entity1 's embarrassing 35 - minute meltdown : ' thank you ! ' @entity0 's more lucid moments included a hint that she might actually launch a @entity81 campaign			1
' if you want something said , you ask a man , ' @entity0 boomed			2
' if you want something done , you ask a woman			0
' @entity86 : @entity0 's audience often seemed unsure what to make of her rambling speech then , waving a ' @entity91 ' sticker , she mocked former secretary of state @entity62			2
' now i 'm ready for @entity62 , ' she told her uneasy audience ' are you ? are you coming ? ' eventually @entity0 returned to one of her time - worn themes : ' lame - stream media ' journalists who have classed her as a low - grade intellect selling weak sauce since @entity101 senator @entity100 tapped her as his running mate nearly 8 years ago			1
and in a fit of pique , she seemed to be blaming her fellow republicans for letting her get clobbered			0
the 2016 election , she said , ' is war for the sovereignty of the @entity22			2
we do n’t sit on our thumbs next time when one of our own is being crucified , and falsely accused of whatever the hit accusation of the day happens to be : racism , sexism , whatever			2
' her appearance at the gathering of grandees came not long after telling the @entity120 she is ' seriously interested ' in a @entity122 bid come the 2016 race			1
in a different interview the previous day she also said she was especially keen on running to make sure a woman is on the slate , saying ' @entity22 has had enough of seeing that ... sign on the @entity129 door saying , " no girls allowed "			0
' but days earlier she told a different interviewer that ' i do n't give a flying flip ' if a woman is elected president			0
@entity136 hate hate hate : @entity0 , speaking at the @entity138 in @entity139 alongside a raft of other @entity1 big - hitters , entered to the @entity143 song ' @entity144 ' and claimed to be ' ready ' to take on @entity62 thank you , and thank you , and thank you : almost sixteen minutes into a 35 - minute speech meant to be a 20 - minute slot , @entity0 had thanked half of @entity4 for hosting her @entity0 spoke at the @entity4 event alongside a host of others whose names have been floated as potential @entity1 candidates , including @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			1
her position near the end of the lineup indicated that the event 's hosts , @entity161 and @entity4 congressman @entity163 , hoped the @entity164 would be a showstopper			1
she nearly stopped the entire show as saturday brought something progressives have waited nearly a decade for : the moment when conservatives stopped laughing with @entity0 and started laughing at her			0
when the substance of her speech arrived , she hit @entity173 over his executive order mainstraiming millions of illegal immigrants , and claimed @entity54 have a worse record for waging a ' war on women ' than conservatives			1
despite frequent references to ' real solutions ' she would propose to solve @entity22 's problems – which she said include a bloated government and a president who refuses to listen to @entity186 – @entity0 did not elaborate on what those fixes might be			0
but ' we get honest on national security , ' she riffed			0
' we give hope to the people that we need not – we will not – succumb to evil , and we call it as it is , we address it			0
' ' that must be , by the way , that 800 - pound elephant in the room of the @entity81 that the radical left wo n't even name			2
' @entity0 , however , named it			0
' it is any @entity203 who would choose evil , whose loyalty to a death - cult perversion is so darkened and has deceived their soul that they actually think they 're welcome here to transform here			0
no ! ' ' what we do is strengthen our military , ' she said			0
' we respect our troops and let them – our troops as our gatekeepers – we let them tell jihadists , " uh - uh , this is our house ! get the hell out "			2

former @entity164 governor and @entity225 *darling* gave *confusing* address at the @entity138 , rambling after her teleprompter froze
the @entity1 ' 2008 *vp* nominee had previously said she was ' seriously interested ' in a 2016 presidential bid , but sounded not - ready - for - prime - time
@entity235 - *scratching* lines included : ' the man can only ride you when your back is bent '
called president @entity173 an ' *overgrown* little boy , *angrily* shouted ' screw the left in @entity34 ! ' and yelled that jihadis should ' get the hell out ! '
