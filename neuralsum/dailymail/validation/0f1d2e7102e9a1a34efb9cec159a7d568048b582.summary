the world gets a first proper look at @entity3 ’s latest gadget tonight when the company launches its first smartwatch			1
with a price tag of about £ 220 , the @entity6 boasts a range of lifestyle functions – promising to open your car door , buy a coffee and even track your heart rate			1
the company hopes it will have a winner on its hands , even though sales of rival products by @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 have been sluggish and many smartwatches have a notoriously short battery life			1
partnerships have been signed with car companies like @entity34 , which will allow users to open the vehicle door through the watch			1
it can also be paired with technology in the home and in hotel chain rooms to automatically let the user in without a key or smart card			1
there will be partnerships with airlines that will see the watch double as a boarding pass to allow users to sweep through airports more quickly			2
importantly , it will be loaded with the new ‘ @entity56 ’ technology , that will allow users to pay for a raft of purchases by waving the watch over a till point scanner			1
the system , which is tied in to user bank accounts , means people will buy lunch or pay for a train or bus ride without the need for cash			1
the watch , which will be linked to the owner ’s @entity66 via a @entity69 link , will also provide a map and directions , vibrating on the wrist to warn of the need to make a turn			2
the first details of the watch were revealed by @entity3 chief executive , @entity76 , in september last year importantly , it will also include a raft of health sensors and trackers , which will measure the heart rate and activity level as part of a program to boost fitness			0
when the first details of the watch were revealed last september , chief executive , @entity76 , said : ‘ we love to make great products that enrich people ’s lives			2
we love to make technology more personal and allow our users to do things they never imagined			0
‘ we believe this new product will redefine what people expect from this category			0
this is the next chapter in @entity3 ’s story			0
‘ it is the most personal watch ever created			0
it is incredibly customisable to find one that reflects your personal style and taste			0
it is also a comprehensive health and fitness device			0
‘ being more active is being one of the best things you can do to improve your health			0
@entity6 gives the ability to motivate people to be more active ... or track what you are doing during the day			1
’ while the watch will have a starting price of around £ 220 it is suggested there will be a host of other premium versions , including one in gold that will cost as much as £ 3,325			2
as such , the company are presenting the device , which was created with input from @entity128 , the former chief executive of the fashion house @entity129 , as very much a fashion item			2
the first version , which was unveiled in the autumn , featured a square steel and glass device with a range of case designs , digital watch faces and straps , some leather , some sporty , and one stainless steel to reflect the style of the wearer			2
it is controlled via a button on the side , which is called a ‘ digital crown ’ and looks much like the winder on a traditional watch			0
sir @entity27 said : ‘ creating beautiful objects that are simple , pure and functional has always been our goal			0
we have designed a range of products so personal that you wear them on your wrist			1
’ @entity160 , technology expert at @entity161 , said : ‘ @entity3 ’s long - awaited entry to the wearables space will no doubt supercharge a market that otherwise seemed destined to be the preserve of techies and early adopters			0
’ the @entity3 watch boasts a range of lifestyle functions including the ' @entity170 ' software , which will allow users to avoid the need to use cash by simply waving the watch over a till point scanner the latest speculation suggests that @entity3 is worried about battery life on the watch - a common issue among existing smartwatches			1
smartphone users already struggle with the relatively short battery life and adding the need to charge a new device will put some people off the whole idea			0
mr @entity160 said : ’ the reveal will hopefully give us greater insight into how this device will benefit our lives with a selection of dedicated app demos , a more finalised look at the software and user interface as well as those all - important price points - we entirely expect @entity3 ’s premium positioning to continue in the wearables arena			1

@entity6 has range of lifestyle functions including opening car door
