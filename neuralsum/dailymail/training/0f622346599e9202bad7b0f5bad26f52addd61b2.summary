by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 manager @entity2 insists @entity4 are happy for @entity5 to play on @entity7 's 3g pitch should @entity8 give the controversial surface the all - clear for their @entity12 opener			1
@entity2 spent last weekend in @entity4 where he saw two games and met up with @entity4 boss @entity14 and his star man @entity5			2
@entity15 of the agenda was the playing surface at @entity7 's rebuilt 3,300 capacity national stadium where @entity3 will kick - off their @entity20 campaign on september 9 - if it passes a @entity8 inspection on friday			1
no problem : @entity4 will allow @entity5 to play for @entity3 on @entity7 's artificial pitch boost : @entity3 boss @entity2 will be able to call on @entity5 for his first @entity12 qualifier next month @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , @entity35 ( @entity36 ) , @entity37 ( @entity38 ) , @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , @entity26 ( @entity25 ) , @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , @entity42 ( @entity41 ) , @entity44 ( @entity43 ) , @entity33 ( capt , @entity43 ) , @entity46 ( @entity45 ) , @entity48 ( @entity47 , loan @entity49 ) , @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , @entity53 ( @entity30 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , @entity5 ( @entity4 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity61 ( @entity60 ) , @entity62 ( @entity25 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , @entity65 ( @entity30 )			1
the new surface will be subjected to laboratory and field tests , determining how the surface reacts to players ' skin when sliding , how the ball rolls and bounces on the turf and how it absorbs the shock of a player hitting the floor when falling			0
@entity2 said @entity14 has experience of his teams playing on artificial surfaces and was quick to point out the dangers , but the @entity3 boss is adamant that @entity5 will be available for the opening game in @entity85 ' ideally we 'd be on the grass as we 're not used to playing on a 3g pitch , ' @entity2 said after naming a 23 - man squad which includes talented youngsters @entity61 and @entity91 , but is without veteran centre - back @entity92 , now without a club following his summer release by @entity30			1
' i was speaking to @entity14 and he said when @entity4 played on 3g pitch against weaker opposition the players struggled because they did n't like the surface			1
' my message to our players is ' forget where we 're playing '			0
we 've got to get a result and whatever the surface we 've got to get through it and do our job			0
' if @entity8 say we 're not going to play on that pitch and we 're going to play on the grass , we 'll play on the grass			1
' but if they say we 've got to play on @entity111 , we 'll play on @entity111 - and get a result			2
that 's how it is			0
' @entity116 words : @entity4 manager @entity14 has spoken to @entity2 about playing on artificial pitches should @entity8 veto the use of @entity7 's national stadium , the game could be switched to @entity121 some three hours away - possibly at @entity123 's @entity122			1
but @entity2 insisted that @entity5 would travel to @entity7 if the game there gets the go - ahead , despite acknowledging that some players have had bad reactions to playing on 3g surfaces			1
' @entity4 understand @entity5 's got a job to play for @entity3 , if he 's available he 's going to play , ' said @entity2 , stressing that his squad would not train on the surface beforehand for fear of picking up injuries			1
' @entity14 said when they trained on 3g a lot of players had bad reactions , it was tough			2
' some of our players have also trained on a 3g pitch and the reaction a day or two after is not good			2
' they 're not used to it and we have looked at that and most coaches at our level would not like to play on a @entity111 pitch			2
' it was a bit of a surprise the games were sanctioned so we 've simply said can it be looked at and that 's what 's happened			0
' superstar : @entity5 , pictured here in action against @entity157 in @entity158 , will be hoping to fire @entity3 to @entity12 @entity2 was also asked whether he would name @entity159 in his @entity161 squad when the @entity163 striker is released from prison in october			1
@entity159 was convicted of rape and sentenced to five years in prison in april 2012 and news of his imminent release sparked an online petition with over 60,000 people saying he should be prevented from resuming his football career			0
' i 've not yet had that conversation with anybody at the @entity175 , ' @entity2 said			0
' it 's not a five - minute conversation , that 's a serious and long conversation before we make any decision			0
' i 've never met @entity159 and i ca n't comment on him but i would n't imagine it 's going to be easy for him to find himself at the level where he was before			0
' but it 's up to myself and the @entity175 to have a conversation about it because it 's such a serious matter			0

@entity3 will face @entity7 in their first @entity12 qualifier on september 9
the hosts hope to use a 3g pitch instead of regular grass
@entity8 will inspect the pitch on friday and decide whether the game can be played on it
@entity5 will be allowed to play by his club @entity4
