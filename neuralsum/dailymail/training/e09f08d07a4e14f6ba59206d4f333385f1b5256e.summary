representatives from tech companies are meeting with @entity8 staff on friday			0
the @entity8 says @entity0 is still collecting information before making final decisions			2
a presidential review board has recommended increasing the number of policy officials who help establish those priorities , and that could result in limits on surveillance of allies			0
documents released by former @entity3 systems analyst @entity42 revealed that the @entity5 was monitoring the communications of several friendly foreign leaders , including @entity46 chancellor @entity45			0

@entity0 and @entity45 spoke by phone wednesday , but @entity5 officials would not say whether they discussed the @entity3 issues			1
leaked : the controversial @entity3 spying program was leaked to the media by former defense contractor @entity42 the president also is said to be considering one of the review board 's most aggressive recommendations , a proposal to strip the @entity3 of its ability to store telephone records from millions of @entity5 and instead have phone companies or a third party hold the records			1
the @entity3 would be able to access the records only by obtaining separate court approval for each search , though exceptions could be made in the case of a national security emergency			1
it 's unclear whether @entity0 will ultimately back the proposal or how quickly it could be carried out if he does			2
before making his final decisions , the president was supposed to receive a separate report from a semi-independent commission known as the @entity79 , which was created by @entity80			0

betrayed : it was revealed that the @entity3 spied on @entity46 chancellor @entity45 it 's unclear why @entity0 will announce his recommendations before receiving the report from the privacy and civil liberties board			1

the report would still be available to @entity80 , where legislators are grappling with several bills aimed at dismantling or preserving the @entity3 's authority			1
that official and those familiar with the @entity8 review insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the process by name			0
@entity0 also met wednesday with members of the @entity5 intelligence community , which largely supports keeping the @entity3 surveillance programs intact			1
shortly after receiving the review board recommendations last month , @entity0 signaled that he could be open to significant surveillance changes , including to the bulk collecting of phone records			1
' there are ways we can do it , potentially , that gives people greater assurance that there are checks and balances - that there 's sufficient oversight and sufficient transparency , ' @entity0 said at a dec. 20 news conference			2

' violation : a judge ruled last month that the @entity3 's bulk collection program appeared to violate @entity150 the president also has backed the idea of adding a public advocate position to the @entity95 , which rules on many of the domestic surveillance decisions			1

he faces espionage charges in the @entity5 , but has been granted temporary asylum in @entity168			0
while @entity0 has said he welcomes the review , it 's unlikely it would have occurred without @entity42 's disclosures			2
last month , @entity5 district judge @entity173 ruled that the @entity3 's bulk collection program appeared to violate @entity150 protections against unreasonable searches , but he did n't issue a preliminary injunction against unreasonable searches because of expected appeals			1
late wednesday , @entity180 lawyers asked @entity173 to halt further proceedings in his court on the @entity3 case and a second @entity3 - related lawsuit until the @entity185 hears the government 's appeal of his december ruling			1
government lawyers said they were asking for the judicial stay from @entity173 because they were concerned that further court proceedings could jeopardize classified information about the surveillance program			0
@entity194 , the conservative lawyer who filed the suit , has said he plans to ask the @entity5 @entity196 to hear the case .			0

@entity0 is expected to limit the @entity3 's access to private *citizens* ' phone records
