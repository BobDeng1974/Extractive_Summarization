by the time most people get to the end of the @entity5 @entity4 ad about the little boy and @entity7 , his lovelorn penguin , they are wiping the tears from their eyes or launching into a ‘ @entity12 , humbug ! ’ tirade about the commercialisation of @entity4			1
as the heart - tugging music swelled and @entity7 got a girlfriend , there was only one thought going through my head : i can not believe how lifelike they made this penguin			1
no doubt many of you thought the same , but i was prepared to be a harsh critic			0
for not only am i an experienced producer of wildlife documentaries , but it was my company that made last year ’s @entity29 documentary series , @entity30 : spy in the huddle			1
the creative team have clearly done their research , impressively capturing the character and behavioural patterns that make the @entity46 — with that white circle around those mournful eyes — one of the most lovable species of penguin			1
but though @entity59 may be adorable , they are hardly the romantic gentlemen that @entity5 would have us believe			1
in fact , they are incorrigible philanderers			0
but more of that later			0
i first came across them when we were filming emperor penguins for @entity66 , a series that made extensive use of hidden and , we like to think , cunningly camouflaged cameras			1
we had them hidden in fake penguins , fake chicks , fake lumps of ice , even fake eggs			2
today , i ’m delighted to say our minimally invasive approach is being used by zoologists working in @entity78			0
but it also produced , for us , some extraordinary footage of what life for penguins is really like in the harsh polar environment — particularly when emperor penguins come into contact with their much smaller cousins , the @entity86			2
the two species are the only ones to nest solely on the @entity78 continent , the @entity90 toughing it out on nests through the winter while the @entity86 ( a @entity94 colleague of @entity96 adventurer captain @entity95 named them after his wife ) nest during the summer			0
monty the penguin stars alongside actor @entity36 , who plays @entity35 , in the heart warming advert after looking for love , @entity7 is given the best @entity4 gift he could have hoped for when @entity35 brings him a female penguin but they use the same breeding grounds , which can lead to clashes in spring when the @entity86 arrive and discover the @entity90 have n’t left yet			1
the sight of bossy @entity86 energetically trying to shoo away @entity90 chicks almost twice their size provided one of the unexpected comic highlights of the series			0
at the risk of anthropomorphising , it ’s almost as if they are natural performers			0
that ’s why i have a film crew in @entity78 — in a region that really is called @entity121 — filming adelie penguins for a @entity4 special			1
that ’s @entity4 2015 , i hasten to add			0
the @entity46 — which , while declining in numbers , is one of the least endangered penguin species — seems to encapsulate what we love about penguins			1
they come ready - dressed in their comedy dinner suits , that ungainly waddle on land raises a smile and they have the cutest , fluffiest chicks — three reasons why they have emerged as the stars of popular @entity135 films such as @entity136 , mr @entity137 ’s @entity30 and the @entity139 cartoon franchise — the latest spin - off of which , @entity30 , is released next month			1
but we also admire how they battle against one of the harshest environments on @entity149 , surviving not just the extraordinary cold , but an array of predators such as the leopard seal and killer whale			0
and no penguin species is braver than the @entity46			1
another of my favourite pieces of footage from @entity158 in the huddle involves a huge seabird , a giant petrel , mounting an attack on a group of emperor penguin chicks , only to be seen off by a small but feisty @entity46			1
he ’s not even protecting his own species , for goodness ’ sake , but the brave @entity46 stands up for them as if they were his own			1
or , indeed , her own ; you have to get very close to an @entity46 to determine its sex			2
at the end of the two minute commercial it 's revealed that @entity35 had been playing with a cuddly toy and not , as portrayed , a live penguin the detail in the @entity5 ad is so impressive			1
playing football like @entity7 might be a bit of stretch , but @entity46 penguins are accomplished walkers , often having to cover distances of up to 30 miles between their nesting grounds and the open sea where they go to feed			1
and , as the ad correctly shows , @entity59 discovered long ago that if you come across an ice - covered downward slope then it ’s far more efficient — and looks a lot more fun — to slide down it on your conveniently prominent belly			0
there are two more sequences in the ad i particularly like			0
one is when @entity7 pops vertically out of a park lake to land on the path next to his young owner			2
in the wild , @entity86 have to reach underwater speeds of up to 30 miles an hour to achieve the vertical lift that sees them leaping straight out of the freezing sea and onto the ice			0
normally they get the speed and angles just right , which , together with super-grippy feet , makes for an impressive , gravity - defying exit			0
but when they get it wrong , as they do occasionally , the result is comedy somersaults , back flips and their fellow penguins being knocked over like skittles			2
my favourite moment in the ad , however , comes when @entity7 takes a toy brick from the playbox and passes it in his beak to the boy			2
in an environment as tough as the @entity78 , where the chances of a fully grown bird surviving from one year to the next are slim , it makes little sense to mate for life if @entity59 are known for anything , it ’s for building their nests out of pebbles , raising them above the ice so when the ice melts during the brief @entity78 summer , the eggs do n’t become waterlogged			2
it ’s that toy brick , rather than the soppy ending , that will draw a tear from anyone who knows their penguins			2
but while they have got most things right , the team behind the @entity5 ad made one mistake , or at least glossed over a distinctly unseasonal truth			0
as you listen to @entity257 warbling his way through @entity260 ’s @entity259 and @entity7 stares balefully at one romantic couple after another , yearning for a girl of his own , you might imagine that @entity59 were swan - like in their lifelong devotion to their mate			1
they may be into sexual equality when it comes to dividing up domestic duties , sharing the feeding , nest - sitting and chick - raising between male and female , but they are surprisingly pragmatic when it comes to love , or rather , sex			0
in an environment as tough as the @entity78 , where the chances of a fully grown bird surviving from one year to the next are slim , it makes little sense to mate for life			0
adelies are known for building their nests out of pebbles , raising them above the ice so when the ice melts during the brief @entity78 summer , the eggs do n’t become waterlogged if no willing female is to be found , frustrated male adelie penguins will resort to chasing vigorously after other males and even , i ’m afraid to say , attempting to mate with dead penguins some penguins , such as @entity295 , practise monogamy , but for @entity86 it ’s a different mate every year			2
each spring the male @entity46 builds his pebbly nest — often stealing from his neighbour for raw materials — in the hope of attracting a female			2
but if he does n’t , the mating instinct can prove overwhelming , a fact that led one of the first scientific papers on the species to be withheld from publication in the prudish early years of the last century			0
for if no willing female is to be found , frustrated male @entity46 penguins will resort to chasing vigorously after other males and even , i ’m afraid to say , attempting to mate with dead penguins			1
in these more enlightened times , not many would bat an eye over gay penguins			0
but necrophiliac penguins ? sorry , @entity7 , that ’s not real love , but it is real penguin life			1
just do n’t tell @entity5 .			0

@entity322 spent a year filming @entity29 's @entity30 : spy in the huddle
he says he knows @entity46 penguins , which @entity7 is , better than most
@entity322 says he was impressed at how lifelike producers made penguin
but revealed while adorable they are not the romantic the advert portrays
