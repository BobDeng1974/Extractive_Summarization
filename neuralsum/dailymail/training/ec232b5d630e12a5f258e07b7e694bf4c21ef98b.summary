by @entity0 last updated at 10:05 pm on 21st january 2012 former @entity3 governor @entity2 's grants of commutations or pardons to more than 200 prisoners , all but eight in his final days in office , disproportionately benefited white offenders among a predominantly black prison population , a @entity12 analysis found			1
@entity2 , a former @entity13 chairman , stirred an uproar in @entity3 last week by the surprise grants of clemency , which numbered far more than any of his recent predecessors ' in a state where law and order are hallmarks of political rhetoric			1
the list included full pardons for four convicted murderers and an armed robber who worked at the governor 's mansion on prison work release			1
most of the pardons were granted to convicts who had completed their prison sentences			1
clemency : @entity36 kicked up a hornets nest in his state when he pardoned 221 convicts , including four murderers ' it is , to say the least , astronomically unlikely that @entity2 's selection was color - blind , ' said @entity44 , executive director of the @entity45			1
' now whether that 's @entity2 's fault or the review board 's fault , is a different question			1
it was somebody 's fault			1
it 's not color - blind			1
' @entity3 's attorney general has filed a complaint alleging that 156 of the pardons were unconstitutional			1
a state judge has scheduled a hearing for monday			2
overlooked in the controversy has been the racial composition of the list of inmates and ex-convicts @entity2 pardoned			1
@entity2 granted 222 acts of clemency in his tenure to 221 individuals : one convict 's sentence was initially suspended in 2008 and he then received a full pardon last week			1
of those , roughly two thirds were white , according to data from the @entity72 and a search of public records			0
the racial makeup of @entity3 's prison population is the inverse : about two - thirds ' black			1
whites make up about 59 percent of the state 's population as a whole and blacks about 37 percent			1
@entity2 said through a spokesperson that race played no factor in the decisions			1
' a majority of the clemency cases were reviewed by the @entity91 before being sent to governor @entity2 , ' @entity2 spokesperson @entity88 told @entity12			1
' race was not a factor in his decision			0
in fact , it was n't even listed on the @entity91 's application			2
' disproportionate : fewer than a third of the pardons @entity2 handed out were given to blacks , despite the fact that they make up nearly two - thirds of the prison population regardless of the underlying reason , such a disparity between the racial background of those pardoned and prison demographics is a significant statistical anomaly , according to @entity112 statisticians @entity113 and @entity114 , who carried out an analysis of the data for @entity12			1
' this type of observational information can not prove causality , though it does indicate a significant relationship between race and the probability of being pardoned , ' @entity113 wrote in an email			0
' the odds of a random sample of the prison population coming out with the same or greater disparity in racial proportions as the pardons list is less than one in a trillion , if race were truly unrelated to pardons			0
' @entity133 , @entity134 professor who served as assistant @entity136 attorney general under former president @entity137 and also worked in former president @entity139 's administration , said the disparity could have implications beyond @entity3			2
' at the very least , those numbers raise some very disturbing questions that need to be addressed by the attorney general and even by the @entity136 @entity145 civil rights division , ' @entity133 said			0
' it should be made absolutely clear that ethnicity is not a factor in determining who should be pardoned			0
it would be a violation of the equal protection clause			0
it would be a violation of the @entity136 @entity156 as well as the @entity3 constitution			0
' @entity158 , chair of the @entity159 , said no data on the race of people who applied for clemency was available because that was not required on the application form			2
' i ca n't remember there being any disparity , ' she said			0
' this parole board has been reviewing inmates black and white and @entity171			2
i 'm in my eighth year , another board member 's in her eighth year and we see a variety of offenders			2
that , candidly , is just not something that we - that i factor into my decision - making process			0
' @entity180 ' @entity179 ' the pardons process begins with an application to the governor 's office , which can then direct the @entity91 to investigate any applicant			2
the minimum criteria for clemency applications , laid down in an internal memo from @entity2 in 2004 , require that applicants be seven years out of custody without committing a crime or can prove mitigating circumstances for their crimes			1
ms @entity158 said the board received more than 500 applications during @entity2 's eight - year tenure			1
of those , just over 250 met the required standards for consideration and were sent on to the governor 's office			2
among the applications forward by the @entity91 , @entity158 calculated that @entity2 granted clemency to 185 applicants and denied it to 69 others			1
@entity205 , associate professor of public policy at the @entity207 , said the racial disparity , while dramatic , may have more complex underpinnings than simple racial prejudice			0
' there 's also a very good chance that black prisoners are less likely to apply for pardons , ' mr @entity205 said			1
' they 're more likely to be disenfranchised and less likely to have financial means and so that could also be a source of the disparity			0
i guarantee that this disparity has many , many causes			0
' when asked about any possible racial disparity in the pardons process , veteran @entity225 , criminal lawyer @entity227 said : ' i do n't think anyone will ever admit wealth and race play a role in the legal system but no one who works in the system can deny it with a straight face and then go home and have a peaceful night sleep			0
' @entity225 attorney @entity239 experienced the clemency process that led to former governor @entity241 reducing in 2002 the eight - year sentence of one of his clients , @entity243 , convicted of manslaughter			2
mr @entity239 said no formal process existed to file for clemency petitions			2
but he said it helped to have an attorney file paperwork on the applicant 's behalf			2
' it 's a process where having money to hire a lawyer and having connections are very helpful , ' mr @entity239 said			2
' it helps to have facts about your case and your record that make a commutation appropriate , but that 's not enough by itself			0
' the @entity91 's ms @entity158 said , however , she had seen very few applicants use attorneys in the pardons process			0
' there was no need for one , ' she said			0
' it 's user - friendly			0
it 's exhaustive but it 's not the kind of work that requires an attorney			0
you do n't have to go and file , you do n't have to do some research , you just have to do some legwork			0
' ' not color - blind ' ms @entity113 and mr @entity114 also found that based on @entity3 's prison demographics , white prisoners were about four times more likely to be pardoned than black prisoners			1
that echoes a recent examination of presidential pardons under president @entity139 by public interest non-profit news organization @entity288			0
in an analysis released last month of 1,918 applications for pardons during @entity139 's administration , @entity288 found that white criminals seeking presidential pardons were nearly four times more likely to get them than minorities			0
last week , @entity3 circuit judge @entity296 issued an injunction blocking the release of 21 inmates who had been given pardons or conditional medical release			0
attorney general @entity302 , the only @entity3 @entity303 to hold statewide office , told reporters last week most of the pardons may have violated a state constitutional requirement that notice be posted in the community where the convicts committed their crimes well in advance of their pardons and release			1
attorney general 's office spokeswoman @entity314 said they were not looking at race as a factor in the pardons			0
the new governor , @entity320 @entity319 , who was @entity2 's lieutenant governor , has taken steps to distance himself from his longtime ally			1
he publicly dispensed with the tradition of pardoning felons who have worked at the governor 's mansion and said he supported the push to change the state 's constitution to limit a governor 's pardon rights .			1

@entity2 says his clemency choices were *colorblind*
however , experts say that 's almost statistically *impossible* since most convicts in the state are black
