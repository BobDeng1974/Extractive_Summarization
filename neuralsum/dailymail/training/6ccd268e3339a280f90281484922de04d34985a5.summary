by @entity0 toughening up : the threshold for a ' good ' pass - currently a c - will be brought closer to a @entity3 , in line with standards in the world 's top education systems			1
the number of top gcse grades awarded will be halved in a shake - up to end an era of soaring pass rates			1
a new top ‘ grade nine ’ will go to entrants who show ‘ really exceptional ’ performance – half the number who achieve an a * in the present system			1
a greater range of lower grades will make it easier for employers and colleges to distinguish between middle and top - performing school - leavers			1
the threshold for a ‘ good ’ gcse pass – currently a grade c – will be brought closer to a @entity3 , in line with standards in the world ’s highest - achieving education systems			1
improvements in grading techniques will also help examiners end grade inflation			0
the plans – published today by qualifications regulator @entity38 – are part of sweeping reforms to public exams instigated by education secretary @entity42			1
they will affect maths and @entity46 gcses awarded in 2017 and several other key subjects the following year			0
@entity38 confirmed that alphabetic grades a * to @entity49 will be replaced by numbers , with nine being the highest			0
chief executive @entity51 said the reforms would restore public confidence in gcses , after years of concern over numbers of a grades , dumbed down content and repeated resits			1
a @entity61 source said : ‘ rising results , year after year , masked the fact that standards were stagnating			0
in future the top grade will be awarded only for top performance			1
‘ we hope these reforms will raise standards and restore trust in the exam system for families , for employers and for the pupils themselves			1
’ under the proposals , entrants will find it tougher to achieve the top grades and more will end up with the existing ‘ @entity80 ’ for fail			1
the current top two grades – a and a * – will be replaced with three in the new system – seven , eight and nine , with nine going to only about one in 30 pupils – half those who gain a * s under the current system			2
of those who passed nearly 7 per cent of exams at a * in @entity46 last year , only 3 to 4 per cent would have merited the new grade			0
‘ this would make the standard of performance required for the award of a grade nine really exceptional , ’ the department source said			0
mastermind : the plans are part of sweeping exams reforms instigated by education secretary @entity42 and will affect maths and @entity46 gcses awarded in 2017 and several other key subjects the following year the numerical @entity102 grading scale will be familiar to many as the system once used to grade o - levels			1
but under the @entity42 system a nine will be the highest grade , whereas a nine at o - level was the lowest			1
before 1975 , pass grades at o - level were numbered one to six , with grades seven to nine considered a fail			2
schools were told the number , but grades were officially recorded as pass or fail only			2
five official grades – the letters a to @entity119 – were introduced in 1975 , with a to c classed as a pass and @entity122 and @entity119 fail grades			2
in 1965 the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) was brought in alongside o - level gce chiefly for lower - achieving pupils at secondary moderns			0
o - levels and @entity129 were replaced by gcses in the late 1980s			0
the current c grade will be equivalent to grade four but will no longer be seen as the benchmark for @entity102 achievement			0
instead , grade five – which will be pitched up to two - thirds of a grade higher than @entity120 – will be the new de facto ‘ pass ’			2
@entity38 said grade five would be pegged to standards in high - performing countries and regions such as @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and the @entity147			0
changes to gcses already confirmed include an end to modular tests in most subjects , with traditional end - of - course exams becoming the ‘ default method of assessment ’ – to stop pupils entering early or multiple times in the hope of eventually gaining a good grade			2
‘ controlled assessments ’ – coursework done in class – will be minimised amid concerns that teachers were able to massage results			0
in a further proposal , a sample of pupils each year – possibly several thousand – would sit an @entity46 and maths test just before their gcses to help examiners ensure grade - setting is robust and accurate and to limit grade inflation .			0

greater range of grades will distinguish between middle and top performers
threshold for a ' good ' pass will be brought closer to a b grade
the plans are part of sweeping exam reforms masterminded by @entity42
