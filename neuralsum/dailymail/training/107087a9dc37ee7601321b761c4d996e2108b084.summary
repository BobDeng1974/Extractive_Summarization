@entity0 was urged to ditch @entity2 green energy targets last night , amid warnings they will add £ 150 to the average family ’s bills over the next five years			1
the prime minister will travel to @entity8 this afternoon to debate stretching new targets that will require @entity10 to slash carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030			1
but a new report from the respected think tank @entity13 warns that existing targets are already putting @entity10 ’s economy and living standards at risk , and calls for them to be ditched			1
ministers insist that the targets will strengthen @entity10 ’s energy supplies and , in the long term , produce thousands of ‘ green jobs ’			1
but today ’s study , based on an analysis of official government figures , suggests that @entity2 green measures have already added £ 59 to the average dual fuel energy bill in this country			2
it suggests this figure will rise to £ 149 by 2020 as the government strives to meet a binding target of producing 15 per cent of electricity from renewable sources			0
today ’s report warns that the impact on business will be even greater , with the average medium - sized firm set to see its energy bills rise by 23 per cent as a result of green measures emanating from @entity8			1
and it says the potential economic benefits of meeting the targets have been grossly over-stated			0
the report ’s author @entity46 said mr @entity0 should now push for the targets to be abandoned			2
if other @entity2 leaders refuse , the @entity10 should drop them unilaterally			2
he added : ‘ despite admirable goals the @entity2 ’s green policies have imposed huge costs but delivered limited benefit and are marred by conflicting objectives			0
' with people in the @entity10 concerned about the cost of living , business still struggling to balance their books and @entity62 needing a more flexible energy supply to wean itself off dependence on @entity66 gas , a radical re-think of the @entity2 ’s energy policy is now vital			1
neither the @entity2 nor the @entity10 can afford to waste more time on a costly and failing policy			2
’ the @entity68 last night said it ‘ does not recognise ’ the @entity13 analysis – and insisted that the drive for green energy was reducing bills			0
the existing @entity2 targets require the @entity10 to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources like wind farms from about four per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent by 2020 a spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t recognise the way these figures have been presented			1
we estimate that , in 2013 , household energy bills were , on average , around five per cent lower than they would have been in the absence of all our energy and climate change policies			0
in 2020 , we estimate that our policies will continue to reduce energy bills			0
‘ we need a diverse energy mix that includes renewable sources like wind and solar in order to reduce our reliance on imports from often volatile parts of the world			0
’ the existing @entity2 targets require the @entity10 to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources like wind farms from about four per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent by 2020 – the fastest increase in the @entity2 today ’s report says this will require about 30 per cent of electricity to come from alternative sources , mostly on - shore wind , which enjoys large subsidies from the taxpayer			1
today ’s report suggests this would be dwarfed by potential savings of up to £ 21 billion that would be achieved by ignoring the targets			2
file picture the targets are legally binding and @entity10 could face swingeing fines from @entity8 of more than £ 220 million a year if it abandons them unilaterally			1
but today ’s report suggests this would be dwarfed by potential savings of up to £ 21 billion that would be achieved by ignoring the targets – money that could be ploughed into insulating homes and improving energy efficiency			2
the study also suggests that projected benefits of meeting the targets have been based on a series of ‘ flawed assumptions ’			0
most importantly , the @entity2 initiative has not led to a global deal on emissions			0
as a result the benefit to the @entity10 of £ 160 billion , which was predicted in 2009 , has instead turned into a likely net cost of £ 17 billion			0
in addition , the study says that the plan has failed to boost @entity10 ’s energy security and has instead exacerbated a potential energy crunch ’			1
@entity136 yesterday said it supported the drive to cut @entity2 carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 , but said any new deal needed to be ‘ cost - effective , fair and flexible ’ .			0

@entity141 says existing targets are already putting @entity10 ’s economy at risk
ministers insist that the targets will strengthen @entity10 ’s energy supplies
@entity150 will travel to @entity8 this afternoon to debate new targets
