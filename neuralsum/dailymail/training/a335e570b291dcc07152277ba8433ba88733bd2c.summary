@entity0 produced a remarkable physical feat to defeat @entity2 in five sets and become the first @entity5 man in the @entity7 era to reach a grand slam semi-final			1
tenth seed @entity0 had beaten @entity10 in the fourth round in five sets in a match that finished at 2.26am - the joint latest finish in @entity7 history			1
he was back on @entity15 barely 36 hours later and battled for another four hours and 15 minutes to put out the @entity17 champion 3 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 9/7 ) 6 - 7 ( 5/7 ) 6 - 4			1
the last @entity5 man to make the last four at a grand slam was @entity21 at @entity22 in 1933			2
down and out : @entity2 was beaten by @entity0 3 - 6 , 5 - 7 , 7 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 eastern promise : @entity0 becomes the first @entity5 player to reach a grand slam semi since 1918 @entity0 said : ' i started a little bit tight but my body was okay , i was feeling more and more confident , especially getting the third set			1
i do n't know how i finished the match but i 'm very happy			0
this is my favourite grand slam			2
i have good memories here and i 'm very happy to be first time in the semis			0
i hope i can recover again and play 100 per cent tennis next round			0
' given @entity0 's exertions , it was no real surprise when @entity2 raced into a 3 - 0 lead , and that was enough for the @entity42 to take the opening set			1
but @entity2 , who put on a masterclass against @entity45 at the same stage last year to reach his first slam semi-final , has not been on top form this tournament and it was the same again			2
the 29 - year - old was making bad mistakes at bad times , none more so than the double fault that handed @entity0 the second set			0
wasted : wawrinkaraced to an early lead before being hauled by by the energetic @entity0 marathon man : @entity0 played in second five set match in succession after defeating @entity10 in last 16 far from tiring , the @entity5 player seemed to be improving as the match went on , his forehand in particular keeping @entity2 on the run			1
@entity0 made his move in the sixth game of the third set with a break of the @entity2 serve and had a set point at 5 - 2 but could not take it			2
and that looked a huge moment in the following game when @entity0 made a complete mess of serving for the set and lost his advantage			0
below par : @entity2 has struggled to find his top form during this tournament the 24 - year - old collected himself to force a tie - break and had another set point on his own serve only for @entity2 to thread a brilliant backhand pass down the line			0
a vicious forehand gave the @entity42 a chance to clinch it but @entity0 responded in kind with a stunning backhand winner of his own			0
these were huge moments in the match , and it was @entity0 who came out on top , @entity2 going long with his 55th unforced error			0
the toll on @entity0 showed after three games of the fourth set when he took a medical time - out to have his blisters treated but he continued to play high - level tennis to keep pace comfortably with @entity2			2
mentor : @entity103 is coached by former grand slam winner @entity104 @entity0 fought back from 4 - 0 down in the tie - break to level at 4 - 4 but missed two forehands wide and @entity2 landed a huge second serve on the back of the line to level proceedings			1
with the match well into its fourth hour , they headed into a decider , and it was @entity2 who finally cracked , serving a double fault to give up two match points at 4 - 5			1
he saved the first but netted a forehand on the second to send @entity0 , who is coached by former @entity121 champion @entity104 , into the last four .			0

@entity0 defeated @entity2 3 - 6 7 - 5 7 - 6 ( 9/7 ) 6 - 7 ( 5/7 ) 6 - 4
he becomes first @entity5 player to reach grand slam semi since 1918
