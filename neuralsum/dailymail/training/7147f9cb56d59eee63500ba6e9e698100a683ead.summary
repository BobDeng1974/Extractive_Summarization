by @entity1 reporter published : 15:29 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 19 september 2013 a doctor who froze embryos with her boyfriend after she was diagnosed with cancer is now battling him in court after he broke up with her and said he no longer wants children			1
@entity8 , 42 , maintains that she has the right to have her biological children and should control the future of the embryos , while her ex-boyfriend @entity13 , 32 , argues that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter			1
the @entity16 is expected to reach a decision on whether it will hear @entity13 v. @entity8 this month - a decision which will no doubt affect thousands of future would - be parents			1
@entity8 has since gone on to carry and give birth to a son - using a donor egg and donor sperm , @entity13 's attorney confirmed			1
but he added that this does not affect the outcome of the case as the court distinguishes between a child that is biological and ' essentially adopted '			1
in court : @entity8 and @entity13 created frozen embryos with their egg and sperm after she was diagnosed with cancer			1
but they later broke up and he said he no longer wants her to use the embryos the couple , who met through their work in a @entity42 hospital , had been dating for just five months when @entity8 was diagnosed with non-hodgkin lymphoma in march 2010			1
knowing that the chemotherapy could leave her infertile , she asked @entity13 if he would provide his sperm so that she could freeze embryos for potential future use			1
he agreed and one week later , he provided a sample at @entity51 's fertility clinic , the @entity48 reported			0
' it was a very emotional time and i was just trying to support @entity8 the best way i could , ' the firefighter and former nurse told the newspaper			2
@entity8 , in a court deposition , added : ' i thought about my different options , of using a sperm donor or someone that i knew for many years and that was a wonderful person			1
' so i decided to go with someone that i thought was a wonderful person and i trusted			0
' new life : she had a child through donors two years after they broke up but she is still fighting to use the embryos for another child			2
lawyers said her baby would not affect the outcome of the case @entity13 v. @entity8 will set a new precedent in the state of @entity77 , where lawmakers have never ruled in a similar case			1
but what decisions have been reached in other states , and what clues do they give to the outcome of the case ? in @entity85 last year , an appeals court gave frozen embryos to a woman who wanted to give birth even though her ex-husband wanted to embryos destroyed			1
as in this @entity77 case , the ex-wife was believed to be infertile following treatment for cancer			1
the court ruled that her wish to be a mother outweighed the man 's desire not to parent children			0
but in @entity102 , a court has previously decided that parenthood could not be forced on someone who was not willing			0
the @entity16 in 1992 ruled that fatherhood was going to be a greater burden for an ex-husband than destroying the embryos would be for his ex-wife , and she was not granted the embryos			0
also similar to this case , a couple in @entity113 who froze embryos signed an agreement saying they could only be used with consent from both parties			1
but the wife , who later became infertile , later requested sole custody of the embryos - which the husband opposed			1
the @entity124 ruled that the contract should stand and the embryos were donated to research			0
at the time , the couple also signed a document that stated ' no use can be made of these embryos without the consent of both partners '			2
they met up with an attorney and a second agreement that gave @entity8 sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it			1
two months after the hospital visit , @entity13 broke up with @entity8 via text message			1
he said he had initially been honored to help out his girlfriend , but later had reservations			0
' i have the right not to be a father , ' he said			0
' it 's something i take very seriously and feel very strongly about			0
' but he later changed his mind and said that he would give @entity8 control of the embryos if the child could never be traced back to him - but when he asked the hospital to destroy his records , they refused			1
he eventually concluded that the child would be traced back to him and that he did not want children at all , at any point			0
in june 2010 , he wrote in an email that he worried he would find someone he was ready to have a family with - but that they would reject him based on the fact he had a child he did not know with a women he did not love			0
but as had been predicted , @entity8 was left infertile by her successful cancer treatment			1
experts said that this infertility did not mean she was unable to carry the embryos and have a child			0
she wrote her ex-boyfriend an email in september 2010 , reading : ' i had a chance to use a random sperm donor and you took that away from me by agreeing to help			2
' i trusted you and now you are trying to take away my chance of having a biological child ... those embryos mean everything to me , and i will fight this to the bitter end			0
' her right ? @entity8 said he agreed to have her children when he gave her his sperm for the embryo and can not take away her right to have children			1
he argues he should not be forced to have them after the fallout , a @entity193 trial court awarded @entity196 rights to the embryos , but @entity13 appealed and a higher court sent the case back , explaining that the case focuses on prior agreements rather than the interests of either party			2
the battle now concerns whether the pact occurred when @entity13 gave the sample or when they signed the medical consent form requiring joint consent for the use of the embryos			2
his attorney , @entity212 , argued that couple often change their minds about having children and the courts should not be involved			0
but @entity8 's lawyer , @entity218 , countered : ' at this point , that sperm no longer exists			1
it has fertilized an egg and become something entirely different : a pre-embryo			0
it is now too late for him to back out of his promises			2
' the couple is now waiting for the @entity16 to decide if they will hear the case			0
@entity8 went on to carry a son and gave birth to him , according to mr @entity212			2
he said that she used donor eggs and sperm for the child , who was born in june 2010			2
battle : the couple is now waiting for the @entity16 to decide if they will hear the case but he added that her having a child would not affect the case as courts differentiate between biological children and one that is essentially adopted , he said			1
' i think it should [ affect the case ] but while it seems to affect the case practically , it does n't affect it legally , ' he said			0
' i do n't think the court will consider it as she could always adopt. ' @entity8 's attorney , @entity218 , confirmed that his client never carried @entity13 's son but would not comment further			2
the case centers around a very modern problem - and an example of technology causing problems that far exceed the scope of the law			0
the need for a definitive ruling is needed now more than ever			0
in 1985 , 260 babies were born through assisted reproductive technology ; in 2010 , the number topped 61,000 , according to the @entity270			0
' this is a decision that really affects every person , ' he told @entity275			0
' hundreds of thousands of embryos are frozen in @entity77 and this case affects what you do with these			2
' it raises some very fundamental issues about creating human life and when your consent is required and it affects all of those cases in the future			0

@entity8 was diagnosed with non-hodgkin lymphoma in march 2010 and asked then - boyfriend to give his sperm for frozen embryos
he agreed and they create three embryos - but two months later he broke up with her and said he no longer wanted children
they had signed agreement saying both needed to consent to use embryos
but her cancer treatment left her infertile and she argued she has the right to biological children and ' it is too late for him to back out of his promises '
@entity8 has since had a son with a donor but this will not affect the case
