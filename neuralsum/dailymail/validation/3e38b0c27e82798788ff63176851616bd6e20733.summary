@entity0 had only to turn to his brother - in - law for advice as he prepared to embark upon his senior international career with the @entity4			1
the @entity6 midfielder arrived at the @entity4 's @entity8 base on monday to meet up with @entity10 's squad for the first time ahead of sunday 's @entity13 qualifier against @entity14 , but he did so having quizzed @entity17 's former @entity16 international @entity15 about life on the big stage			1
@entity15 is married to @entity0 's sister , @entity20 , and sent the 25 - year - old on his way telling him just to do what he has been doing for the @entity24 this season to help leave them within striking distance of the @entity28			1
@entity6 midfielder @entity0 ( left ) holds off the challenge of @entity31 's @entity30 on saturday asked what the former @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 midfielder 's advice had been , @entity0 said : ' just ' be yourself ' , really , i think that 's all you can do			1
' you have been picked for a reason and i have been picked because the manager was impressed with the way i play , so if i come here any different and not confident , then i would not show the best of my ability			2
' he just said , ' be yourself , that 's what you are picked for '			1
' i 'm pleased with my form			1
i am part of a team that 's top of the league and things are going well			1
my main goal when i play is to be a positive influence on the team and try to be part of a successful team , and at the moment , we are so all in all , good			2
' @entity0 celebrates scoring his side 's second goal during @entity6 's 3 - 0 win against @entity31 on saturday @entity0 , who qualifies for the @entity4 through his grandmother , has fought his way back in his career after having to prove himself all over again in non-league football with @entity68 after being released by @entity34			1
however , he never lost belief in his own ability and has worked his way back to where he believes he belongs , ready to make his mark in international football and hopefully , in the @entity28			0
he said : ' i was playing non-league and international football is far from that			0
i was obviously only a young boy then			0
my main focus then was just to work as hard as i could to get back to a level i thought i could play at			0
' i am confident in my own ability and the level i feel i am capable of playing at			0
the key to that is just working hard and not resting on your laurels			0
' from the age of 19 up until now , i have n't done that			0
' @entity15 told his brother - in - law @entity0 to ' be yourself , that 's what you are picked for ' @entity10 has been to see the player , who has represented @entity93 at @entity94 and under - 19 level , on several occasions this season , but did not inform him of his impending elevation			1
@entity0 said : ' i did n't realise			1
it was a thursday and i was just in the gym , and one of the lads just popped in and said ' congratulations , you got called up '			2
obviously , i was n't aware of anything , so it was a nice surprise			0
' it was a different way of finding out , but one that was exciting			0
i spoke to @entity10 maybe a few days after that and he told me his thoughts , and i just could n't wait to get over here			1
' @entity0 was one of several new faces at the training ground on tuesday with skipper @entity113 and @entity115 striker @entity114 also now in harness , although there was an addition to a casualty list which includes @entity121 defender @entity120 when winger @entity122 limped off			1
@entity4 manager @entity10 ( sixth left ) addresses his squad in @entity124 on monday he was immediately sent for a scan on his left ankle , leaving @entity10 fretting over one of his regular starters			1
the manager said : ' @entity122 has got a sore ankle			0
he 's gone for a scan - precautionary , i hope - but he was just feeling it a little bit			2
we 'll see how he is			0
' it did n't happen in training			0
he felt a little bit sore after yesterday			0
he thought it might go away , but it 's just a bit of a pain across the ankle			2
' @entity122 has played exceptionally well for us in most of the games since i have been in charge			0
obviously i know him quite well - very well , in fact - and yes , he 's a good player for us			2
