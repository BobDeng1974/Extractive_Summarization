by @entity1 reporter published : 10:24 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 15:23 est , 9 december 2013 a former @entity3 ambassador has slammed the company in a blog post explaining why she is cutting ties with the yoga clothing brand			1
@entity8 , who runs yoga studios in @entity10 and @entity11 with her husband , @entity12 , says the company takes advantage of financially - strapped instructors by promising them free clothes and publicity in exchange for teaching overcrowded , free classes to @entity3 shoppers			1
mrs @entity8 adds that the entire premise of the @entity3 brand goes against many of yoga ’s spiritual concepts , and that its aesthetics have little to do with those truly interested in the ancient @entity29 practice			1
ambassadors no more : @entity8 ( @entity31 ) and @entity12 have written an open letter to @entity3 to formally disassociate themselves from the brand in a post on their blog , mrs @entity8 and her husband @entity12 explained the reasons why they are openly disassociating themselves from the label			1
mrs @entity8 says that not only are @entity3 ’s clothes un-yoga - like , but the role of being a ‘ brand ambassador ’ has nothing to do with yogic principles , which encourage modesty			1
for this reason , she says that the role is a ‘ distracting goal for so many young teachers			0
’ ' a lot of those teachers are poor and struggling			0
they are going to take the free clothes because they are broke and probably need them			0
they can not afford to actually shop in @entity3 though , and given a choice even if they could afford to they might choose another brand , ’ she writes			2
‘ it ’s not even necessarily a “ yoga clothing store , ” ’ she added			0
‘ a yoga brand would very likely appeal more to the sensibilities of a person actually dedicated to yoga by offering organic tops and bottoms and items that you can wash and dry for years and still look great like @entity72 and @entity73 do			0
’ mrs @entity8 says that being a @entity3 ambassador entails teaching in - store community classes in exchange for free clothes , trips , and publicity			1
yoga instructors : @entity8 and @entity12 ( performing partner yoga with their baby in tow , above ) served as @entity3 co-ambassadors , but had moral concerns with the role instructors are often by enlisted into the ambassadorship when @entity3 staff appears at their studio classes with a ‘ big bouquet of flowers ’ and make ‘ a big fuss over you in front of people … it ’s kind of like being asked to the prom in the middle of the @entity102 pep rally , ’ she writes			1
at first , mrs @entity8 rejected the brand ’s offer			2
but years later she and @entity12 were asked to act as co-ambassadors and teach the community classes as a team , which would also help them promote @entity108 , the chain of yoga studios that they jointly own			1
the @entity110 accepted the deal			0
but when mrs @entity8 got pregnant , @entity12 was left to teach the classes alone			1
the overcrowded classes were full of students who required ‘ a lot of adjusting … to keep things safe , ’ writes mrs @entity8			2
' i do n’t think yoga teachers should sell out and be " ambassadors of " or be " @entity121 " anyone at all ' in her opinion , ‘ these classes are generally unsafe , ’ because there are not enough teachers present to help correct the students ’ form – many of whom are yoga novices that have not developed the skills necessary for avoiding an injury			0
the brand ’s purported safety hazards , as well as its retail and stylistic standards , lead many yoga teachers to voice their disdain for @entity3 among fellow instructors			2
but many of the teachers expressing their @entity3 frustrations are acting ambassadors for the brand , mrs @entity8 says			1
she finds their hypocrisy to be unacceptable and a complete disregard for many yogic principles			0
‘ if you are one of those “ ambassadors ” one of those teachers taking the free gear but making snarky remarks about the @entity3 brand in general conversation or even in your head , then you should not be an ambassador , ’ mrs @entity8 wrote in her essay			1
she added : ‘ in fact , i do n’t think yoga teachers should sell out and be “ ambassadors of " or be “ @entity121 ” anyone at all			0
loyal following : though the @entity3 brand has a strong following , @entity8 says that the label 's clothes and principles are far from yoga appropriate ‘ i think it ’s kind of gross for teachers to get all free - geared up by any one brand … [ @entity3 ] should keep to their business in their stores and stay out of yoga studios			1
’ mr and mrs @entity8 ’s open letter asked the brand to stop using their images for promotion in any way and to never contact them again			1
mrs @entity8 says that they have quietly given away all of the @entity3 clothes that they were awarded for free			2
mrs @entity8 even feels that the @entity3 ambassadorship is a farce because though the brand builds the role up to be an honor , a mark of achievement , ‘ it ’s not really even a special thing to be asked , ’ mrs @entity8 writes			2
' it 's not really even a special thing to be asked to be a @entity3 ambassador ' ‘ eventually they get around to almost everyone in a market , ' she elaborated			2
when it comes down to it , she thinks the label ’s ‘ owner ’s antics and politics , and it ’s advertising and marketing campaigns have no place in the yoga room			0
all that matters when you practice is that you practice , not what you wear when you do it			0
’ their commentary follows many recent @entity3 - centric scandals that range from last year ’s sheer @entity217 pant debacle , to company ceo @entity219 ’s comments that @entity3 ’s clothes do n’t work for ‘ some women ’s bodies			0
’ earlier this month , the label ’s @entity225 , @entity224 outpost outraged local shoppers with a holiday window display that rhymed apple pie with ‘ rubbing thighs ’ the brand responded to the backlash on its website with a statement to customers that read : ‘ we ’re deeply sorry , the display is being taken down			0
we celebrate that thighs rub together — ours do too .			0
