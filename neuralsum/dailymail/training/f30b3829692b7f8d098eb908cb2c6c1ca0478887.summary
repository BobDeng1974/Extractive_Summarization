worrying : @entity0 contestant @entity0 worked on the @entity2 police case detectives are being paid overtime to watch @entity0			1
the ‘ cushiest job ever ’ is so @entity5 officers can monitor a former colleague taking part in the @entity9 reality programme			2
@entity0 , 33 , stunned @entity12 bosses when he entered the @entity0 house last week			1
until recently he was working on @entity14 – the inquiry into @entity2 and allegations of historic sex offences by other celebrities			0
senior officers raised fears that mr @entity0 could compromise their highly sensitive investigation , prompting the programme ’s producers to agree to a five - minute delay on the ‘ live ’ footage			1
and detectives are mounting a costly round - the - clock operation to monitor the programme over the next two months , it has emerged			1
incredibly , the force is offering an inducement to watch @entity0 this weekend			1
because they have been given less than 15 days ’ notice to work on a rostered rest day , officers will receive time - and - a - half overtime pay			1
detectives are also entitled to a 10 per cent bonus for hours worked between 8pm and 6am – whether or not they are on a scheduled day off			1
a source said : ‘ this has to be the cushiest police job ever			0
questions have to be asked whether this is really necessary			0
’ it is not known how many officers will be in the office at any one time watching the programme , and recording it in case of the need for evidence			2
but a source said that it was ‘ good practice ’ for two officers to be on duty together , in case one falls ill or asleep – even though there is no longer a 24 - hour live tv stream of @entity0			1
most days , only two hours are broadcast live from the house , with a further two hours of ‘ highlights ’ and analysis ’			1
there is also a daily @entity62 feed from 8am to 2am which officers are believed to be monitoring			0
last week it was reported that police were ‘ frantically ringing around ’ @entity2 ’s victims to reassure them their identities would not be revealed by mr @entity0 , the 3 - 1 favourite to win the show , which runs until august 19			1
the overtime bonanza has fuelled concerns about the running of @entity14 – which critics claim has become a celebrity witch - hunt – when @entity5 is trying to make cuts of £ 500million			2
mouthing off : police are monitoring what is said by @entity0 , pictured with @entity78 around 30 detectives are working full - time on the investigation , set up last autumn in the aftermath of the @entity83 scandal			1
it has already cost £ 1million , including salaries , various costs and more than £ 200,000 in overtime			2
detectives are said to be contacting anyone who was interviewed by mr @entity0			1
the former officer – believed to have been involved in two high - profile @entity92 arrests – tried to avoid discussing his police career on his first night in the @entity0 house , describing himself as ‘ unemployed ’			1
he told host @entity95 : ‘ i ’d done ten and a half years in the police and i ’ve worked really hard and achieved a lot			2
i just need a change			2
i wanted to explore the creative side of my personality			0
’ lawyer @entity102 , head of the abuse department of @entity104 , which represents 62 alleged victims of @entity106 , said : ‘ this is extremely traumatic for some of the victims			0
‘ they have poured their hearts out to this detective – some of them disclosing details which they have n’t yet told their family			0
‘ now they fear that him appearing on @entity0 will mean that some highly confidential information will be revealed			1
it ’s not just the fear of what might come out on nation television , it ’s also the fear of what this detective might be telling other housemates when the cameras are not on him which is giving them such torment			0
’ no fear : @entity0 has certainly opened up since he entered the @entity0 house new direction : @entity0 has said he left the police to explore a new side to his life @entity9 refused to be drawn on criticism levelled at the programme			1
it said : ‘ @entity9 takes its obligations as a broadcaster seriously and , as has been made clear to @entity5 , extensive procedures are in place to ensure that nothing will be broadcast during the course of @entity0 which would involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality , invading the privacy of others , committing libel or a contempt of court			1
’ last night a @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ the @entity12 has raised our concerns with @entity9 about the potential risks posed to live investigations by featuring a former detective constable who worked on those investigations			2
‘ the integrity of those investigations and our care for victims are of the utmost importance			0
measures have been put in place to mitigate any risk			0
unfortunately initially we had no choice but to spend overtime to ensure we monitored the comments being made on the @entity9 programme over the weekend as we did not have prior notification of his inclusion on the programme			2
the need to pay overtime is now significantly reduced and the ongoing necessity to review the programme remains under regular review			0
’ revealed : @entity0 was involved in the @entity2 case which found the deceased tv presenter to be one of ' the most prolific sex offenders ' the spokesman said the cost of monitoring the programme would be released ‘ in due course ’			1
last month the @entity184 revealed that comedian @entity185 was being investigated by @entity92 officers over claims that he indecently assaulted a woman in the @entity189 in the 1980s			0
detectives are probing claims he committed the alleged offence during a concert tour after the @entity195			2
@entity185 , 59 , was originally arrested in january over alleged sex offences in the @entity197			0
he denies all the allegations			0
other arrested celebrities include , entertainer @entity200 , dj @entity201 and comedian @entity202			0
disgraced pop star @entity203 has also been detained			0
they also deny any wrongdoing			0
pr guru @entity206 has been charged with 11 counts of indecently assaulting teenage girls between 1966 and 1985			0
the 70 - year - old has vowed to clear his name , labelling the allegations ‘ a load of nonsense ’			1

@entity0 stunned bosses by entering the @entity0 house
the 33 - year - old says he left the force saying that he ' needed a change '
detectives ensured ' live ' footage had a five - minute delay so it could be monitored
time - and - a - half overtimes and bonuses offered for shifts
