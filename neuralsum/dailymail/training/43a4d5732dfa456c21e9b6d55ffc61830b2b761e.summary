clinics are employing a ‘ no questions asked ’ approach to gender abortions , a @entity1 mp claimed yesterday			1
@entity6 accused a leading provider – the @entity7 – of misogyny for refusing to condemn doctors who help parents seeking to get rid of a girl			1
dr @entity6 , who is also a gp , said : ‘ this is about equality			1
it ’s very harmful and we must be very clear that it ’s illegal			0
’ ‘ we should not be colluding with an attitude which says that having a girl , or in some cases having a boy , could in any way force someone to become mentally ill. accusation : dr @entity6 ( left ) accused @entity25 ( right ) of misogyny in her article last month ' if i was seeing a patient who was in a distressed state because they felt they were under pressure from their family to abort a female foetus , i would be very concerned for them			1
‘ i certainly would n’t be colluding in a view that it was the right thing to do for them to go ahead with the termination			0
’ @entity25 , chief executive of @entity7 , caused a storm last month by saying doctors are legally free to terminate pregnancies when the parents are unhappy with the sex of their unborn child			1
writing on the website spiked , mrs @entity25 said : ‘ a doctor agreeing to an abortion on grounds of rape would be breaking the law no more and no less than a doctor who agrees an abortion on grounds of sex selection			2
‘ while it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion , nor is rape , or incest , or being 13 years old			0
' her comments followed the decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions – as part of a newspaper probe – for women who said they did not want girls			1
the @entity73 said there were grounds for charges but it would not be in the public interest to proceed			2
mrs @entity25 said that in ten years at @entity7 , she had ‘ never heard of a woman walking into clinic and simply saying i want to have an abortion because i do n’t want a girl or i do n’t want a boy ’			2
‘ women who come into the clinics have a whole complex set of reasons why they may want to end the pregnancy and it may very well be that the circumstances of the pregnancy are very much a part of that , for whatever reason , ’ she added			0
pressure : dr @entity6 warns a ' no questions asked ' policy ignores the nuances of a woman 's feelings ‘ the law at the moment works reasonably well			1
so if a doctor believes that the woman ’s request for an abortion for any reason is best for her , then the doctor can make that referral			0
‘ now that to me makes sense , because the doctor believes that she is perhaps so distraught , so strung out , so completely distressed that it is better for her mental health for the doctor to refer her for an abortion			0
’ speaking to the @entity115 , dr @entity6 said : ‘ no woman walks into a clinic and says i want to abort my child because of the sex			2
but there are times when you can get the sense that a woman is under pressure			0
‘ if you take a “ no questions asked ” view , then you are not going to understand that			0

dr @entity6 , a @entity1 mp , *blasted* the *ceo* of @entity7 for *condoning* abortions on the grounds of gender
