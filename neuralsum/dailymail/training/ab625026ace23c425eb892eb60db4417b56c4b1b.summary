a pensioner has spent Â£ 40,000 on cosmetic surgery in order to hang onto her looks			1
@entity4 , 75 , who has been under the knife 18 times to keep her face wrinkle free , claims the only downside of her cosmetic addiction is that people wo n't stand up for her on the bus - because she does n't look old enough			1
the pensioner , from @entity13 , @entity14 , has never hidden her love of surgery and books herself in at the clinic at the first sign of getting ' turkey neck '			1
' it has been worth every penny			2
' i wanted to look in the mirror and like what i saw smiling back at me - the effects of ageing are n't attractive at all ' @entity4 first had surgery - a lower facelift with a @entity26 surgeon - aged 47 in 1986			1
since then she has been perfecting her face and body with an average of one trip to the surgeon every 18 months			2
no step is too far for the obsessed @entity44 , who followed the masses of brits that head abroad every year to go under the knife by having a lower facelift in @entity51 , @entity52			2
she returned in 2007 for liposuction on her legs , and again in 2008 to have a bump taken out of her nose			2
@entity4 , 75 , used to work as an actress but retired several years ago her most recent round of plastic surgery involved another facelift , a neck lift in april 2012 , a brow and cheek uplift and liposuction on her stomach just seven months later , and liposuction on her and right leg three months after that			1
just last october , she had another series of liposuction to her right leg , hips , stomach , and her chest			2
@entity4 said : ' i just love it when the surgery is over and there 's a three pounds of @entity4 left on the table			1
' and the mum - of - one has n't said no to going back under the knife if she feels like she needs another nip or a tuck			2
she said : ' i 'd never say never			0
my worst nightmare would be getting ' turkey neck ' , ( even ) if i was 100 i would have that done , i think it 's hideous			1
' @entity4 , 75 , claims people are often shocked to discover her age so far , @entity4 has no regrets and she could n't be happier with her results , and is full of praise for the skills of her most recent surgeon , @entity94 of @entity95			1
she added : ' he is absolutely marvellous - really i could n't have asked for better treatment			0
' he 's even managed to do some of my procedures under local anesthetic so that i can smile for him during the surgery and he can get my face absolutely right			0
' although her daughter @entity102 , 34 , a physicist working in @entity103 , was at first hesitant about her mother 's many cosmetic procedures , @entity4 says she soon came round to the idea			1
@entity4 said : ' my daughter raises her eyebrows and says " oh mum , you 're not going to get another disgusting thing done to your face are you ? " @entity4 has undergone 18 different cosmetic surgeries since 1986 ' but we were on holiday once and we saw a coach load of old dears trundling off their coach and i looked at them and i said : " ' would you rather that i looked like them ? " ' and she of course said " no , you just carry on as you are			1
" ' i did promise her that i 'd never look younger than her though			1
' i always said that i wanted to do my improvements gently and little by little - it 's awful when you suddenly see someone whose whole face has changed dramatically			0
' if had n't been so open about it i think even some of my closest friends and family would n't have noticed			0
1986 - @entity132 face lift 1995 - @entity133 1996 - face lift 1997 - corrective surgery to remove mark from previous cosmetic procedure 2006 - @entity132 face lift 2007 - @entity139 on legs 2008 - nose job 2012 - @entity142 2012 - neck lift 2012 - @entity144 2012 - @entity145 2012 - @entity139 on abdomen 2013 - @entity139 on back 2013 - @entity139 on right leg 2013 - @entity139 revision on right leg 2013 - @entity139 revision on left hip 2013 - @entity139 revision on abdomen 2013 - @entity139 revision on @entity156 ' i am able to feel exactly as i want and as soon as i do n't , i head back to the surgeon			1
' when it comes to luggage at a train stations i 'm happy to point out to people that just because i do n't look my age , i still need help with my suitcase			0
' i 'm the first person to say " i 'm nearly 76 you know , " to people who might be able to help me down the stairs			0
' most people are very surprised when i tell them , they normally just say - you look good for your age			0
' but i think it 's obvious that i must have had work done - nobody looks like this naturally			0
' but people always think that people who have been under the knife look plastic and stretched - i think i 'm quite the opposite			0
' @entity4 's surgeon at @entity95 , @entity184 : ' in my practice i 've always had much older people - my oldest facelift was 89 but she was very active and just wanted to look better for the rest of their lives			1
' age itself is not a restriction but health is of course a crucial factor			0
we need to be sure that surgery can be done in a safe manner			0
' people have surgery for all sorts of reasons , i had one lady who was moving to @entity204 in her 70s and wanted her breasts and arms to look good in a bikini			0
' just because you 're older , your desire to look better to look better has n't gone			0
