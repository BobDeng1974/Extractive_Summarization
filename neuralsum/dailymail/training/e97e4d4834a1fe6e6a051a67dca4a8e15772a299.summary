by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 chief @entity2 has urged @entity4 to ' try harder ' ahead of this week 's @entity6 @entity5			1
the @entity8 outfit are in the midst of another disappointing campaign following on from last year 's disastrous season where they failed to register a single podium finish			2
@entity3 appeared to have turned a corner over the winter after rookie driver @entity16 and @entity4 finished second and third respectively at the season opener in @entity19 in march			0
signed , sealed , delivered : @entity3 driver @entity4 greets fans at the @entity21 on saturday but the @entity6 team have failed to visit the rostrum since , with @entity4 recording a best result of only fourth at the @entity25 @entity5 earlier this month , while @entity16 's seventh place last time out in @entity28 is his best finish since @entity30			1
@entity4 has scored 14 points more than his rookie team - mate , but the pair are evenly matched over one lap this term , with the @entity3 duo tied at 4 - 4 ahead of @entity4 's home race this weekend at @entity38			2
' i 'm sure @entity16 is giving a big wake - up call for @entity4 , and in some ways you say : " great , we 've made a great choice with @entity16 " , but in other ways you say , " come on , @entity4 , you are a world champion and one thing you can do on a consistent basis - and you should be doing it - is beating your team - mate "			0
in action : @entity4 wows the crowds at the @entity54 on saturday speaking his mind : @entity3 boss @entity2 ' do i want him to try harder ? of course i do - he 's a highly - paid grand prix driver			1
' yes , we are not giving him the best car and , yes , it would be challenging for him to win in it , to say the least , but he could do his bit and @entity16 has to make it as difficult for him as possible			0
' @entity4 is out of contract at the end of this season and @entity3 have already made contact with @entity67 's unsettled @entity66 about a return to the @entity6 team			1
@entity2 has also targeted a sensational reunion with another of his former drivers , in @entity73 , and the @entity3 chief refused to deny that the @entity6 star , whose deal at @entity77 runs until the end of 2015 , is on his radar			1
' we would always hope that the best available drivers would wish to drive our cars , ' added @entity2			0
' the key word is " available " because people have contracts and we respect those contracts , but if @entity73 was in a position to drive for us next year , as with many of the other top drivers if they were in that position , we 'd love to have them on board			0
' no one should ever feel threatened , either drivers or engineers , all we want to do is win and we have to take considered positions and considered decisions on that process			0
