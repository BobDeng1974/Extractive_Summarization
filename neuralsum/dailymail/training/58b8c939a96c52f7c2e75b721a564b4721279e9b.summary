by @entity0 published : 12:41 est , 2 july 2012 updated : 13:55 est , 2 july 2012 inadvertently betting on different horses to the ones her disabled father had picked out is probably the best mistake @entity5 has ever made			1
a slip of the pen enabled the young mum from @entity9 to convert a £ 2 stake into a cool £ 394,487 by winning the weekly @entity12 bet - which involved picking the winners of six televised races			0
@entity5 , 22 , had placed the bet at a @entity17 shop in the city on behalf of her father @entity19 , 53 , who suffers from arthritis			0
@entity22 winners : inadvertently betting on different horses to the ones her disabled dad @entity24 had picked out meant he actually won nearly £ 395,000 however , despite widespread publicity to find the winner of the huge jackpot the pair had ruled themselves out as not all of @entity19 's predictions had won			1
@entity17 boss @entity32 launched a nationwide appeal to find the mystery @entity35 before last weekend so they could take advantage of a free selection in saturday 's bonus race at @entity40 and potentially add a further £ 251,966 to their haul			1
but @entity5 only discovered the slip had won after the bonus race deadline had passed when she went into the @entity17 shop in @entity46 to place a fresh £ 2 bet for her dad			1
she said : ' i was at the counter when the assistant told me they 'd been looking for me and i knew he was n't joking as he was so deadly serious			2
' when he first told me that the bet had won i thought it was the place part and might have been a few hundred pounds , not hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
winning ticket : despite widespread publicity to find the winner of the huge jackpot the pair had ruled themselves out as not all of @entity19 's predictions had @entity62 is pictured her with her father @entity19 and the winning ticket ' it was weird when i heard how much it was			1
it has n't sunk in really - not even now			2
' i had initially written the bet out on the wrong slip for the jackpot and the lad behind the counter put it on the @entity12 slip for me and copied over my numbers			2
she said her dad had been a fantastic father who deserved a change of luck , adding : ' my dad does n't know how he picked @entity79 at 33 - 1 in the last leg , but it must have been a slip of the pen and i also put the number 18 in the second leg in and there were only 16 in the race , so that went on the winning favourite			2
' @entity19 who sleeps on the sofa at the family 's two - bedroomed council flat said he now plans to splash out on a new house and take his children and grandchildren on a dream holiday			1
the former builder 's labourer who hails from @entity98 , near @entity99 , had n't realised that his first horse @entity101 in the 2.25 at @entity102 was a non-runner and that the rules of the bet automatically transferred his selection on to the winning 7 - 2 favourite @entity108			1
lucky store : the @entity17 bookies where @entity5 bought the winning ticket in @entity9			0
she placed a bet on six horses as part of the @entity116 forecast bet he said : ' @entity5 is my angel - she and all my kids and grandkids mean the world to me			2
' i do n't bet during the week , but do the @entity12 when i can afford it on a saturday			0
' i knew there were 568 tickets going into the last race at @entity126 and only one on @entity79 , but i never realised i was the winner as i thought i was out in leg one			1
' i 've not even thought about missing the bonus race , because this is so unbelievable			0
' i 've had years of pain and operations with arthritis in my legs and @entity5 and my son @entity136 to the shop to place my saturday bet			0
happy family : @entity19 pictured with his daughter @entity5 and other members of the family			0
he says he wants to buy a bigger house and take the family on a dream holiday to @entity145 ' our first priority with the win will be to buy a bigger place to live and i also want to take them all on the holiday of a lifetime			1
we do n't really do holidays as we have just enough to get by , so i ca n't remember the last time we went on one if ever			0
' the pair became the first substantial six figure winners not to come forward in the pool bet 's 13 year history and @entity19 had even shown the @entity12 slip to a neighbour as he knew they had the final five winners on the ticket			0
he had left it at their house and had to retrieve it to collect their fortune .			0
