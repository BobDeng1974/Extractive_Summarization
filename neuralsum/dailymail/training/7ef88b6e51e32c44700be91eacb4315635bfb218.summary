the world 's largest union for flight attendants says passengers should be forced to stow their mobile phones during take - off and landing			1
the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) is suing the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) , arguing that the reversal on a long - standing ban is causing passengers to ignore safety announcements and could turn smartphones into dangerous projectiles if not stowed properly			2
laws have been passed that allow the use of mobile devices during flights , but the @entity7 believes they are inadmissible due to insufficient debate and lack of clarity of what training would be provided			2
the @entity23 in @entity24 has issued new guidelines			0
they state that passengers can use portable electronics , including phones and tablets , at any time during flights and , while acknowledging that testing of devices on board is important for navigation purposes , the union 's main focus is on the stowage of electronic devices			1
a spokesman for the union told @entity42 : ' @entity7 is only concerned about the stowage issue			0
' if portable electronic devices can be safely left on during take - off and landing , they must still be properly stowed during take - off and landing so that in a sudden stop or deceleration , they wo n’t fly out of passengers ' hands and injure others in the cabin , including the first responder flight attendants who are needed to conduct the evacuation , or impede and hinder emergency evacuation through the aisles			1
' we have significant concerns on this particular topic for crew and passenger safety in the cabin , but it 's also a matter of protecting the rulemaking process when considering any future changes to regulations			0
' a spokesman for the flight attendants ' union says it is only concerned about the stowage issue @entity76 has already decided to let passengers use wifi and send texts the union highlighted that devices can distract passengers from safety announcements and become dangerous projectiles			1
the @entity7 also says that in letting passengers keep the devices out , the @entity8 changed an agency regulation without steps required by law			1
' any time there is a change in aviation safety regulations , the law requires a notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for public comment			0
' the @entity8 announcement that some portable electronic devices no longer need to be safely stowed during take - off and landing changed the existing stowage rule without following a formal rule making process			2
' this announcement , which changed existing practice overnight , failed to consider training for flight crews who would be charged with implementing the new rule and increases the risks of injury to crew and passengers when evacuating an airplane in an emergency			1
' a case brought by the @entity7 to ban the use of electronic devices on take - off and landing looks to have failed but the judges hearing the case suggested they wo n't be prying portable electronics out of passengers ' hands			1
' airlines have always had discretion on how to handle this , ' judge @entity122 told a lawyer for the 60,000 - member union			1
judge @entity128 asked about the flight attendants ' concern that allowing passengers to keep out electronics leaves ' more things to fly around ' the airplane cabin during turbulence			1
but a lawyer for the government , @entity136 , told the judges that cellphones and other small devices are no more dangerous than books that passengers have been allowed to keep out			2
@entity76 , who have pushed on with mobile allowances on their flights , have already allow the use of voice calls after landing			0
they have no plans to permit the use of mobile phones for voice calls during flights as feedback from customers has shown the majority of them find them an intrusion and disruptive			0
but customers can use their mobile phones and other handheld devices , to send and receive texts , emails and data on their @entity166 service , which also offers internet access between @entity168 and @entity169			0
@entity76 are in discussions with @entity171 about leading @entity172 in a new era of broadband in the air			2
starting with @entity177 domestic routes we intend to roll - out @entity172 ’s first ground - based 4g broadband network giving customers the internet access they expect on the ground while in the air			2
the @entity8 does insist that mobiles are put into airplane mode for flights however , but passengers can still listen to music and watch downloaded movies or television programmes			2
the court will issue a written ruling at a later date			0
the case will have provoked interest from @entity172 after the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) last month relaxed the rules on electronic devices on flights			1
passengers flying into or out of @entity172 will now be able to use portable electronics including phones and tablets at any time during their flights			1
starting immediately , @entity172 - based airlines can , at their own discretion , allow passengers to leave electronics on throughout the entire flight , without putting them into airplane mode			1
but airlines will need to certify their planes are n't affected by transmission signals before allowing devices to be used			1
spokesman @entity212 for the @entity23 said the plans are a step beyond what 's allowed by the @entity216 @entity8			0
‘ we 're basically opening the door where , in theory , you 'll be able to continue making your phone call through the gate throughout the flight , like you would on a train			0
’ @entity76 already lets passengers on its business class flights from @entity168 to @entity169 to use wifi and send texts , and is starting to relax the regulations on other flights as well			0
a spokesman for the @entity177 's @entity233 said : ' the ruling means it 's now up to the airlines to what they allow , but obviously they have to go through certain tests and procedures			0
' but it could be that you can use your mobile and other devices just like you would in a car , train or other form of transport			0
' the ruling is a legally binding document , so it 's something that has to be accepted			0

last month rules changed in @entity172 regarding use of mobiles on planes
now up to ' discretion of airlines ' but will have to test thoroughly
@entity216 flight attendants ' union took their own case to court
said that devices ' distract ' passengers and could be ' projectiles '
believes crew and passengers could be ' at risk of injury '
