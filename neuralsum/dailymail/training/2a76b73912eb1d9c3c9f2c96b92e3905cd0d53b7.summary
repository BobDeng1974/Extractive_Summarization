by @entity1 reporter in the early hours of 17th july 1918 , @entity2 of @entity3 was marched into a cellar of a house in @entity6 and mown down by a firing squad			1
along with the @entity9 , those who were thought to have died that morning included the @entity11 @entity10 , his son , @entity13 and his four daughters , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
but now a respected @entity20 historian has now claimed that @entity21 might not , as previously thought , have perished at all			0
murdered : the @entity22 ( from left ) @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity24 and @entity18 instead , @entity25 believes that the @entity18 did indeed flee to the @entity26 and says he has new evidence to prove it			1
since her death , women posing as the @entity20 princess have repeatedly come forward , among them @entity32 who first appeared in @entity33 in 1920 , two years after the @entity20 royals were executed			1
@entity35 , who also went by the names @entity37 and @entity38 , later moved to the @entity39 and was portrayed for decades as the escaped daughter of the last @entity42 emperor			0
but in 1991 , when the remains of the @entity20 royals were unearthed , dna testing proved that the bodies were indeed those of the @entity9 , @entity11 and their children			1
family : @entity2 with his family , including @entity18 ( far right ) and son @entity13 devoted : @entity2 was devoted to his wife @entity10 and died in her arms on that fateful morning in 1918 testing also ' conclusively ' proved that @entity35 was not , as she claimed , the @entity18 , and instead a mentally troubled @entity55 factory worker named @entity32			1
@entity25 , however , is unconvinced and claims that @entity35 really was the lost princess in an explosive new book			1
' on the basis of the archive documents discovered , and new @entity20 and foreign evidence i have seen since 1991 , i have reason to think the royal family 's fate is not as certain as it has been believed for almost 100 years , ' he said			2
the new documents from the @entity66 and elsewhere offer evidence from @entity69 family confidantes and relatives , as well as doctors who treated @entity35 , who believed it was ' quite possible and even probable ' that she was @entity20 princess @entity18			2
his book entitled who are you , ms @entity78 ? argues she was ' labelled an imposter too easily ' , @entity74 revealed			0
happy family : @entity18 with her father , @entity2 , the last of the @entity42 emperors final months : the @entity42 pictured during their exile in @entity83 which lasted until april 1918 doomed : the @entity20 royals during their final months before being shot by revolutionaries in july 1918 imposter : @entity32 claimed to be @entity18 although her claims are much disputed although dna tests were carried out on bones purporting to be those of @entity18 and on a lock of @entity35 's hair after her death , @entity25 argues the genetic analysis is not conclusive			1
the book builds on the theory of eminent @entity98 historian @entity97 that the @entity100 - born empress @entity10 along with the imperial couple 's four daughters were saved			0
' i do not assume presumptuously she was executed by the @entity105 , ' said @entity25 who served on a @entity20 government commission which concluded bones found near @entity6 were the remains of @entity2 ' this is for the reader to decide			1
' he claims testimony from @entity105 and @entity112 @entity20 which states the entire family were killed in july 1918 is not trustworthy			1
' the former needed an image of an uncompromising new government determined to wipe out the old world without a trace , and the latter - a @entity3 without an emperor , ' said @entity25			1
he expect still - secret papers documenting diplomatic negotiations between @entity100 and the @entity122 , due for release in 2018 , to throw new light on a possible secret exchange close to the end of the @entity127			0
' why such mercy on the part of the @entity105 ? after the leftist @entity131 assassinated @entity100 ambassador @entity132 , @entity130 could breach the @entity133 , which would have ruined the @entity122 regime			2
therefore , they had to negotiate , ' said @entity25			2
discovery : the @entity42 were discovered in 1991 and laid to rest at the @entity138 fortress childhood : tsar @entity2 and @entity141 met during family holidays in @entity143 and remained close friends firm friends : tsar @entity2 and @entity141 were cousins and close friends thanks to their mothers he added : ' all over the world this issue has been degraded for decades by unpretentious stage productions , garbage literature and films			1
' we need scientific clarity over this complicated issue			0
therefore , i am only publishing the documents			0
where the truth lies , is up to the readers to decide			0
' officially , @entity3 believes it has found the genuine but incomplete bones of the royals , despite reservations by the @entity163			1
the @entity42 , who are buried in the former royal capital of @entity165 , still have living relations - among them @entity168 , whose maternal grandmother was princess @entity170 , the older sister of the doomed @entity11			2
after @entity2 abdicated on 15th march 1917 , he and his family were moved from house to house as the revolution and ensuing civil war raged around them			2
by may 1918 , they had been installed at the @entity178 in @entity6 which was under @entity105 control			2
the house was owned by @entity180 , a dedicated @entity105 and @entity105 with close links to the @entity182 - the secret police force run by the revolutionaries			0
at around 2.15am on the morning of the 17th july 1918 , @entity180 and a squad of @entity105 burst into the bedrooms of the @entity20 royals and ordered them into the cellar			1
minutes later , the soldiers , each armed with a revolver and led by @entity180 , followed them into the room			0
according to @entity180 , he ordered them to stand			0
characteristically , the @entity11 did so ' with a flash of anger '			0
' your relations have tried to save you , ' he is believed to have said next			0
' they have failed and we must now shoot you			0
' the @entity9 rose from his chair and only had time to utter ' what ... ? ' before he was shot several times in the chest			0
the @entity11 died next , killed by a single bullet fired by commissar @entity209 that entered her head just above the left ear , followed by her haemophilliac son @entity212 , who was just 13 - years - old when he died			1
the last to perish were @entity18 and her sisters , saved , initially by the valuable diamonds hidden in their bodices			2
the girls were then bayoneted by the @entity105 fighters before being finished off with a shot to the head .			0

@entity25 says @entity18 probably did escape
claims dna testing in 1991 was flawed and bones found were not hers
says @entity11 and @entity18 's sisters @entity15 , @entity24 and @entity16 also got away
believes that impostor @entity32 was indeed telling the truth
@entity2 of @entity3 was executed on 17th july 1918 by @entity105
his son @entity13 also died along with family servants
