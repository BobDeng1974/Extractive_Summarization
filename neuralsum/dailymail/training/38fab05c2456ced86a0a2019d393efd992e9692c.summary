women who suffer from obesity when treated for breast cancer are more likely to relapse obese women treated for breast cancer are more likely to suffer a relapse than slimmer patients			0
a study has shown for the first time that overweight women have worse outcomes from the most common form of the disease			2
it found women who are obese when diagnosed have a higher chance of dying prematurely			0
researchers believe the causes are hormonal			0
their results suggest that extra body fat causes hormonal changes and inflammation that may drive some cases to spread and recur , despite treatment			2
previously , it has been suggested that a greater risk of the disease returning in heavier women might be due to under - treatment with chemotherapy drugs			1
it was feared they may have been receiving doses aimed at slimmer sufferers because their body size had not been taken into account			0
the latest study of almost 7,000 female patients was led by dr @entity37 , of the @entity39 ’s @entity38 , in @entity40			1
‘ we found that obesity at diagnosis is associated with about a 30 per cent higher risk of recurrence and a nearly 50 per cent higher risk of death , despite optimal treatment , ’ he said			1
‘ treatment aimed at interfering with hormonal changes and inflammation caused by obesity may help reduce the risk of recurrence			1
’ the study compared the health outcomes of obese and overweight patients with others who took part in three trials sponsored by the @entity60			2
participants had to have normal heart , kidney , liver , and bone marrow function , excluding patients with other significant health problems			0
as a result , researchers were able to disentangle the influence of obesity from other factors			0
losing weight after diagnosis may reduce insulin which may be effective in cutting the risk of recurrence of breast cancer the researchers found that increasing body mass index – or @entity80 , the relationship between weight and height – significantly increased women ’s risk of cancer recurrence and early death			1
this was despite optimal treatment including chemotherapy and hormonal therapy			2
there was a stepwise relationship between increasing @entity80 and poor outcomes only in women with hormone receptor - positive breast cancer			0
this is the most common type and affects two - thirds of sufferers			0
dr @entity37 said it was ‘ biologically plausible ’ that increasing weight leads to greater risk of recurrence via higher insulin levels			1
it was uncertain if losing weight after diagnosis could cut the risk of recurrence , but some studies suggest it reduces insulin levels , which ‘ might be effective ’ , he added			1
@entity114 , clinical nurse specialist at @entity115 said : ‘ we know a healthy weight is beneficial for reducing the risk of a range of health conditions			1
‘ so , while this study may be useful , it ’s important to put this into perspective			2
there are a number of key features of breast cancer that will influence the risk of it coming back and each person ’s predicted outlook will vary			0
‘ for those who have been diagnosed , there is emerging evidence that maintaining a healthy weight , as well as being physically active may help reduce the risk of the disease returning			1
‘ however , this can be really difficult as weight gain can be a common side - effect of treatment			1
’ dr @entity143 , head of commissioned research , @entity145 , said : ‘ the findings provide further evidence that obesity can have a detrimental effect			0
‘ maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of breast cancer , particularly after menopause			1
‘ obesity can also affect the chances of survival for those with the most common type of breast cancer , so it is vital patients are given support on how to control their weight			0
’ the findings are published online in @entity163 , a journal of the @entity165 .			0

study in @entity40 show weight loss after treatment may help *decrease* risk
