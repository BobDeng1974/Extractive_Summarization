by @entity1 science correspondent in @entity2 published : 09:41 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 09:55 est , 15 october 2012 super-hero sniffer mice that could save lives with a twitch of their nose are being bred by scientists			2
the ‘ danger mice ’ have been genetically modified so that their noses are hundreds of times more sensitive to the scent of explosives than house mice			1
in future , they could be deployed to countries scarred by war to rapidly sniff out landmines , which are then cleared by a human handler			1
one of the mice in study during training , when they hone their skills with @entity27 , a chemical cousin of @entity29 that is safe to work with the lab. although the project - funded by the @entity34 government ’s health research arm - may sound rather off - the - wall , the idea of super-sniffer rodents is not without precedent			1
a @entity39 charity already uses giant @entity41 rats to sniff out @entity29 and has deployed them in @entity42 and @entity43 and on the @entity46 - @entity45 border			1
however , while the @entity48 , as they are called , are very good at their job , it takes nine months of painstaking work to train them to detect @entity29			1
the @entity52 ’s annual conference in @entity2 heard that the answer could be to use genetic modification to bypass the need for this extensive training			0
the mice are trained to have noses 500 times more sensitive to @entity29 researchers believe mice could be bred to sniff for landmines , which a chip under their skin alerting handlers when they find traces of @entity29 using gm technology , scientists at the @entity67 have created mice that have up to 500 times more of nose cells that detect @entity29 - like chemicals			1
researcher @entity72 said : ‘ the rats are very effective but mice have some advantages as mine detectors because they are cheaper to manage and house and easier to breed			2
’ in addition , it is relatively easy to manipulate the key cells in the mouse nose			0
it is hoped that the animals ’ inbuilt sensitivity to @entity29 - like chemicals means they will not have to be trained			1
instead , they will naturally home in on explosives			2
possibilities include planting a chip under their skin that will sense changes in their behaviour that indicate that they have spotted a mine			2
the professionals will then step in			0
a @entity39 charity already uses giant @entity41 rats to sniff out @entity29 and has deployed them in @entity42 and @entity43 and on the @entity46 - @entity45 border			1
they have been trained to make a clicking noise when they smell the explosive			0
a bite of banana serves as a reward and an incentive			0
rats were chosen because they have an acute sense of smell , yet are small and light enough not to detonate the mines			0
the project has been highly successful , with team of two rats and two handlers who clear the mines after they are detected , covering more than 3,000 square feet of land in an hour			0
in comparison , it would take two men using conventional detection equipment two full days to cover the same area			0
a baby giant african pouch rat tethered by a wire to its harness learns to identify and mark a target scent while being trained by a pioneering @entity39 ngo a baby giant african pouch rat is rewarded with a banana by its trainer after accurately finding a dummy mine dr @entity72 , who describes the mice as biosensors , or biological sensors , said : ‘ this is only for detection purposes			2
' you ’d still need the human handlers to take the mine out			0
‘ there are about 72 nations contaminated or affected by mines			0
‘ the big problem with mines is that they are an enduring legacy of conflict , so after the wars have ended communities are still impeded from going back to their normal daily lives			0
‘ mine removal is a very expensive , very lengthy and hard business and there is a critical need for a @entity29 biosensor			1
’ the @entity151 said that the danger mice would only ever be one means of detecting hidden explosives			1
it added that in an area packed with mines , the animals noses may become quickly overwhelmed .			2

genetically modified mice have noses 500 times more sensitive to explosives
researchers *investigating* chips under their skin that can alert humans when @entity29 is found
could be deployed to sniff out landmines
