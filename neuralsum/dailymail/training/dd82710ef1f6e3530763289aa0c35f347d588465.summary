two @entity1 writers have been praised for donating prize money they received from prime minister @entity3 to organisations that have been left short by recent government policies			1
mr @entity3 handed out a total of $ 600,000 at the prime minister 's @entity7 , the country 's richest prize for writers in a range of categories			1
@entity14 , the co-winner of the fiction award for his novel @entity17 , accepted the prize from mr @entity3 - then promptly announced he would be giving the $ 40,000 to the @entity19			1
the organisation , which supplies new books and funds literacy projects in remote @entity24 communities , is one of many programs that will be affected by the $ 534 million the government has announced it will cut from @entity24 programs over the next five years			1
a well - known controversial topic for the @entity42 government which promised to ' stop the boats ' , the @entity39 is currently lobbying against the government 's new migration laws which it claims neglects more than 150 asylum seeking children in detention at @entity49			1
the indirect slights came after a tough week for mr @entity3 and his government , who have been scrutinised on talk shows and voting polls over their policies and actions			0
in his acceptance speech , mr @entity14 , who has said previously the @entity3 government 's environmental policies made him ' ashamed to be an @entity1 ' , said ' the measure of any civilised society was its willingness to look after its weakest '			2
' money is like sh * * , my father used to say			0
pile it up and it stinks			0
spread it around and you can grow things , ' mr @entity14 said , according to the @entity72			0
children 's writer @entity37 ( second from right ) donated $ 10,000 of the prize money he was awarded for his book @entity78 to the @entity39			1
pictured : the prime minister poses with all of the prime minister 's literary awards winners the past week has been a tough one for mr @entity3 and his government , who have been scrutinised on talk shows and voting polls over their policies and actions ' if just one of those children in turn becomes a writer , if just one brings to @entity1 and to the world an idea of the universe that arises out of that glorious lineage of 60,000 years of @entity1 civilisation , then i will think this prize has rewarded not just me , but us all , ' he said			1
mr @entity37 's speech about his book 's character , also appeared to include a hint of irony when taking into account the presenter of his award			2
' i like to think that after the book is closed that he will grow into a man who will have empathy and understanding and compassion for what he sees out there , ' he said before announcing where his prize money would be directed			0
the two authors have been commended across social media for their generous donations , with many people being quick to point out the irony			0
the two authors have been commended across social media for their generous donations , with many people quick to point out the irony one meme being circulated depicting @entity37 said : ' that awkward moment when the asylum seeker persecuting @entity81 gives you a literary award and you donate @entity128 to the asylum seeker resource centre '			1
meanwhile the @entity39 also took to @entity130 to tell @entity3 : ' you could learn from this , pm '			0
the executive director for the @entity19 , @entity133 , also told @entity134 that she hoped mr @entity136 's example would one day would be followed by @entity1 's leaders			2
meanwhile the @entity39 also took to @entity130 to tell @entity3 ' you could learn from this , pm ' ' ironically we do n't receive any government funding so we 're not affected [ by government funding cuts ] as of yet , but we are started to see the impact of cut backs because more communities are approaching us about our programs , ' ms @entity133 said			0
' there is a huge need out there ; almost 90 per cent of the remote communities we survey told us there were no books in their homes or few too little and in many communities it 's very challenging and books are way down on the list of priorities			0
' we 're overwhelmed by the enormous generosity , it 's so unexpected and it 's such a generous gift for a writer to give - for @entity14 to turn around and do this for the greater good is such an uplifting gesture			2

@entity167 co-winner @entity14 said he would give his $ 40,000 prize to the @entity19
children 's fiction winner @entity37 said he would give $ 10,000 of his prize to an asylum seekers resource centre
they were among the winners in the prime minister 's @entity7 , worth a total of $ 600,000
the government is cutting $ 534 million from *indigenous* programs over the next five years , and has adopted a hard line against asylum seekers
both authors have been praised for the ' irony of donating their winnings
