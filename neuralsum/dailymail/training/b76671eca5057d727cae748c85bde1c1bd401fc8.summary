' sit down , ' president @entity0 begged – not ' get out ' – after two @entity2 hecklers interrupted his economic speech on thursday with shouts about illegal immigration			1
then , for the first time in his presidency , the @entity6 stood down and @entity0 promised to meet with them before he left			1
' i ’m sorry , what are you yelling about now ? ' @entity0 said amid the sudden yelling			1
' sit down , guys			1
' ' come on , sit down			2
i ’ll talk to you afterwards , i promise			2
i ’ll bring you back			0
i ’m wrapping things up here			0
see , everybody is going to start – i ’m on your side , man			0
sit down , guys , we ’ll talk about it later , i promise			2
' before returning to his teleprompter , the president told his security force to take a step back			2
' you do n’t have to escort them out , ' he ordered			0
' they ’ll sit down			2
' and then , again directed at his hecklers : ' i promise i ’ll talk to you afterwards			0
' @entity0 had just wrapped up a section of his speech , partially cribbed from earlier fundraising addresses , in which he ripped into @entity61 for slow - walking his demands for immigration reform measures			1
' on immigration issues , ' he said , ' we ’ve got – and to their credit , there are some @entity61 in the @entity69 who actually worked with @entity70 , passed a bill [ that ] would strengthen the borders , would help make the system more fair and more just			0
' ' but the @entity75 , they have n’t even called the bill			0
they wo n’t even take a vote on the bill			0
they do n’t have enough energy or organization or i - do n’t - know - what to just even vote " no " on the bill			0
' ' @entity87 passed immigration reform , and you love @entity87 , ' he vented at the @entity61			0
' @entity90 ahead and do it			0
' according to a @entity34 press pool report , @entity34 staff escorted the protesters behind the stage immediately after the president 's speech was over and he ' began glad - handing with folks in front			1
' ' the presumption is [ that ] they briefly spoke to ' @entity0 , the pool reporter wrote , ' but we moved so quickly in [ the ] motorcade that it could n't have been for long			1
' while @entity0 pressed the flesh following his speech , @entity34 staffers escorted the hecklers backstage to meet with him bbq to go : after the speech , senior adviser @entity109 ( @entity110 ) and traveling aide @entity111 carried @entity0 's food orders from @entity114 onto @entity115 in @entity21 @entity0 has asked @entity117 for $ 3.7 billion in supplemental funding , half of which he has said would help @entity120 and @entity121 deal with the humanitarian crisis of thousands of unaccompanied children entering the @entity31 illegally every week			1
only about 3 per cent , however , would be dedicated to strengthening @entity125 's southwest border with @entity27			0
@entity0 has resisted calls for him to see the crisis up close , saying he has no plan to visit the border			1
he has , however , demanded a larger , more permanent overhaul of @entity31 immigration law that would give most otherwise law - abiding illegal aliens a path to legal status – and , for some , a path to citizenship			1
@entity0 began that process in 2012 with a move to halt deportations of people brought to the @entity31 illegally as children before july 2007			1
he denied on wednesday that the sudden policy shift is responsible for a deluge of children migrating from @entity125 and crossing into @entity22 and @entity144 .			2
