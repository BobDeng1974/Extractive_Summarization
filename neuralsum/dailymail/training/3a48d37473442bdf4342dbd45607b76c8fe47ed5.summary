as many as 10,000 patients a year are dying due to poor @entity5 care , the head of the health service watchdog has warned			1
@entity8 , chairman of the @entity7 , said standards across the country were ‘ dangerously variable ’			1
he said there were anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 avoidable deaths a year in hospitals alone , not counting those which occur due to failings by @entity15			1
@entity8 , chair of the @entity7 warned that @entity5 standards were ' dangerously variable ' mr prior , who took up his post in january 2013 , said the @entity5 must change its culture to ensure there is ‘ no hiding place ’ for inadequate doctors			1
the watchdog is currently carrying out spot checks on every gp surgery , hospital and care home in @entity29 – which could lead to the worst being shut down			0
it has promised the inspections will be more rigorous than before and each organisation will be given an @entity34 - style rating of ‘ outstanding ’ , ‘ good ’ , ‘ needs improvement ’ or ‘ inadequate ’			0
mr prior , a former @entity38 mp and party chairman , said : ‘ standards of care are highly variable , sometimes dangerously so			1
‘ we have some outstanding hospitals , we have some inadequate hospitals			0
and the variation in primary care between different gp practices is probably even greater			0
‘ this variation matters , not just because many patients receive poor care , indeed many thousands die avoidably every year			2
no one knows how many , but in hospitals it has been estimated to be anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 – not a statistic that any other area of human activity would be happy with			2
’ writing in @entity58 , he added : ‘ variation strikes at the heart of the @entity5 and its core principle that everyone should receive good quality care free at the point of delivery			0
in fact they do not			0
’ the @entity7 has already published its findings for the first 40 hospital trusts to be inspected and five were rated inadequate – one in eight			2
a spokesman for health secretary @entity72 , pictured , said poor care had been ' swept under the carpet ' a study in the @entity75 in 2012 warned that up to 5 per cent of all hospital deaths were avoidable , the equivalent of 12,000 a year in @entity29			1
it is not the first time mr prior has spoken out about failings in the health service			1
last year , he warned the @entity5 had been allowed to become so powerful under @entity82 that nobody dared criticise it			2
he also attacked his own organisation , saying in the past there had been a culture of ‘ incompetence ’ , ‘ suppression ’ and ‘ oppression ’			0
responding to mr prior ’s comments on avoidable deaths , a spokesman for health secretary @entity72 said : ‘ for too long poor care in the @entity5 was swept under the carpet which resulted in the tragedy we saw at @entity98 under the last @entity82 government			1
‘ the role of the @entity7 and the new chief inspectors is to root out poor care wherever they find it without fear or favour			2
’ @entity105 , chief nursing officer at @entity29 , said : ‘ the overwhelming majority of our patients receive great care from staff who are pulling out all the stops			0
‘ we do need to do more , but the quality of care is better now than at any point in the history of the @entity5			0

@entity7 chair @entity8 issued the stark warning today
he said between 3,000 and 10,000 deaths could be avoided a year
mr prior warned these figures do not *include* *mistakes* made by @entity15
