an overweight @entity1 man won a landmark discrimination case against his employers , after a high court judge ruled the effects of obesity can be classed as a disability			1
@entity8 , 49 , weighed more than 21 stone when he was dismissed from his post as an it manager at @entity12 @entity1			1
he was sacked after spending seven years off work with health problems linked to his size such as asthma , diabetes , high blood pressure , chronic fatigue and knee problems			1
above , the @entity28 in @entity29 mr @entity8 , from @entity30 in @entity31 , initially lost the case when it was ruled that he could not be categorised as disabled but that decision was overturned on appeal			1
it is understood that mr @entity8 , who now weighs 19 stone , has since secured a six - figure settlement from a health insurance company			1
his case echoes the ruling by the @entity41 last week that although obesity itself was not deemed to be a disability protected under @entity46 laws , it could be disabling in its effects			1
it means that companies could now be obliged to provide bigger desks and special parking spaces to accommodate larger staff members			2
@entity53 , a 25st @entity55 childminder , claimed he was fired because his weight affected his performance the @entity41 case was brought by @entity53 , a 25st @entity55 childminder , who claimed he was fired because his weight affected his performance			2
the development was described as ‘ regrettable ’ by @entity60 , a spokesman for the @entity61			0
he said : ‘ employers should be hugely concerned about this			0
they will face problems if employees insist that they are disabled , and need special furniture or wider access to fire exits , for example			1
‘ but the biggest cost will be the amount of money they will have to spend in contesting cases made against them			0
lawyers will be licking their lips over this ruling			0
’ he added that lack of clarity around what constitutes obesity would prove problematic			0
‘ in my opinion the [ @entity83 ] court was gravely in error not to put a definition on what they consider to be disabling obesity , ’ he said			0
‘ they did not confirm the original ruling from july which indicated having a body mass index of 40 would be the cut - off point			2
now , without that definition , every person over the @entity94 ’s threshold of a @entity95 of 30 will feel that they can make a claim			0
’ he said in practice overweight people would face more discrimination and feel further singled out by sitting in ‘ the office “ fat - chair ” ’ or by being allocated a more desirable parking space ahead of their colleagues			2
in @entity1 , 64 per cent of adults are overweight or obese , costing the @entity108 £ 5 billion a year .			0
