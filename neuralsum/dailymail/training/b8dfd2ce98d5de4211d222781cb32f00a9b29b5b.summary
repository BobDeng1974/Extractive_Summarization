@entity0 is cock of the walk here in the @entity4			1
asked why @entity5 wants to beat him so fervently , he swallowed his modesty and said with a smile : ‘ it ’s because i ’m good looking , man			1
i ’ve got the car			0
i ’ve got the girlfriend			0
what can i say ? ’ so we can safely assert that the rivalry between the two title contenders has not abated			2
while some of us wish our @entity19 hero would act with a touch more humility , it is probably hypocritical of us to decry him entirely for his boastfulness			0
for the sniping , moaning and crashing are precisely the reasons why so many eyes will be glued to the action when the lights go out at 1pm bst on sunday			2
we await to see whether the two @entity30 men will come together			1
‘ i guess i just keep on doing what i am doing , ’ he said			0
‘ i feel it ’s important for me not to change			0
they have hired me to win the championship			0
they have hired me to get them as many points as possible and to bring the car home , and i have generally been doing that every race			0
’ the mood of the two men is markedly different			0
@entity5 seems cowed by the public humiliation of being fined by his team and saying sorry like a stuck record for crashing into @entity62 at @entity63 a fortnight ago			1
in @entity64 he has been working on transforming his image from ‘ @entity66 ’ — as in @entity67 — into a fully grown man			0
he was winning fans as a result			0
but , according to observers in his homeland , his seemingly timid acceptance of @entity30 ’ harsh censure has spoiled all that			1
eyes on the prize : @entity5 is now the favourite for this year 's title after extending his lead over @entity0 spa break : the two drivers came together in @entity83 , @entity5 admitted the crash was his error i am not convinced that verdict on his personality is accurate			1
yes , it is @entity5 ’s style not to engage in public slanging matches , but he has a hard core			1
his approach now is to close his ears to controversy and focus totally on the only important task : winning the title			0
he needs to feel the love of the team			0
since @entity63 he has received it in spades , hence his jaunty air			0
one colleague from his @entity40 days noted that @entity0 ’s truculence and status as undeniably the biggest star in the sport causes his bosses to court his favour			1
it may sound like an odd phenomenon that grown men with big bank balances need the same affirmation as young drivers , but many of them do			0
@entity117 , @entity0 ’s old @entity40 boss , could hardly see a driver without planting his palms all over his back			1
picture perfect : @entity0 with his popstar girlfriend @entity122 at the @entity123 earlier this week drivers ' standings : @entity5 is currently leading the championship , while team - mate @entity0 is second 1 @entity5 ( @entity127 ) @entity30 220 pts 2 @entity0 ( gb ) @entity30 191 pts 3 @entity130 ( @entity131 ) @entity132 156 pts 4 @entity134 ( @entity63 ) @entity135 121 pts 5 @entity137 ( @entity139 ) @entity138 110 pts 6 @entity141 ( @entity127 ) @entity132 98 pts 7 @entity143 ( @entity127 ) @entity144 70 pts 8 @entity146 ( gb ) @entity40 68 pts @entity0 ’s moodiness makes him harder to woo			1
that is probably why @entity117 did not discipline @entity0 when he posted his then team - mate @entity146 ’s telemetry on @entity152 in 2012			1
it may explain why @entity30 did not act when he revealed what @entity5 said in a private meeting after the @entity63 crash			1
@entity5 , more serene and balanced , is lower maintenance and does not need the same level of indulgence			2
the question of which driver is favoured by @entity30 is not a simple one			2
the team are somewhat divided			0
the @entity30 board began the team with the avowed intent of running a @entity64 national team			2
that is why their first driver line - up was @entity171 and @entity5			2
that did not deliver success , so @entity174 was drafted in to carry out a review			0
he signed @entity0 to much fanfare , telling the board that this man could win the title for them			1
@entity174 remains a @entity0 devotee ; many at @entity182 , the @entity30 headquarters , hold on to the notion of a @entity64 super-team , so @entity5 is their man			1
then there is the team at @entity187 , @entity188			0
they are virtually all @entity19 , so we can assume that most of them favour their compatriot			0
the growing feeling in @entity195 is that if @entity0 loses the title to @entity5 he will leave			1
his contract talks are on hold and are only due to resume once the season is over			0
if @entity0 fails to win the title , the @entity30 board will have no need for him			1
a @entity64 winner in a @entity64 car would obviate the need for @entity0			2
escape route : @entity0 could return to @entity40 , the team he started his grand prix career with @entity40 are ready to offer him an escape route			1
they and @entity212 , their engine partners of next season , want a marquee signing to end a period of decline at the team			1
@entity146 , who is 34 and thought by the @entity40 hierarchy to be small fractions short of fast enough , could well make way			2
but @entity0 is still fighting to win the title			1
if he does , he will almost certainly stay at @entity30 and have the advantage of driving a quick car again			2
his preparations for tomorrow ’s race , where he will try to claw back some of his 29 - point deficit to @entity5 , were hindered yesterday when he missed an hour of the second practice session with an electrical problem			1
he was fastest in the morning , @entity5 fastest in the afternoon			2
‘ i ’ll try to understand what @entity5 learned in his session and i ’ll try to learn that through data , ’ said @entity0 of his missed mileage			1
‘ the team generally works together			0
when one car moves forward so does the team			0
it ’s always difficult but i ’m quite relaxed about it because it ’s not the first time i ’ve been in this situation , so i feel i ’m able to deal with it			0

@entity40 are ready to offer @entity0 an escape route from @entity30
they , and next year 's engine partners @entity212 , want a marquee signing
and @entity0 could leave @entity30 if he loses title battle to @entity5
@entity5 leads @entity0 by 29 points heading into sunday 's @entity35 *gp*
