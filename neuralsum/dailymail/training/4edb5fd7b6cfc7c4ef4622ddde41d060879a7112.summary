looks like butter would n't melt in this adorable mutt 's mouth			0
but is this pooch responsible for ripping up a whole box of tissues on the floor of its owner 's living room ? keen to find out which of his two dogs wasted an entire box of tissues , a bemused owner says : ' ok , which one of you made the mess with this paper ? who did this ? who tore up the @entity21 ? ' but whichever mischievous dog committed the crime , it seems the owner might have trouble finding out - and poker - faced pooch @entity27 seems to be keeping schtum			1
poker - faced @entity27 is keeping quiet about a pile of ripped up tissues strewn over the living room floor at first , it looks like @entity27 is the troublemaker			1
looking down from the sofa at the damage on the floor , it seems he might not get off the hook easily			0
is that a hint of guilt in his eyes ? his owner asks : ' @entity27 ... did you do that ? did you do this right here ? ' but before he receives a telling - off , the camera pans round and all is revealed - @entity27 's friend @entity51 has n't done a very good job of covering his tracks			2
he 's standing , facing the wall , with a box of @entity21 stuck on his head			1
maybe he 's thinking if he ca n't see anyone , no one can see him ? as he looks at the scene of the crime , gnarly the pooch does n't seem like a particularly innocent party looks like someone had a lot of fun with a slipper , a box of ripped up tissues and what appears to be a disembodied plastic frog - all strewn across the carpet at the scene of the crime @entity51 is the culprit - padding around bewildered with a key piece of evidence on his head			1
case closed ! but @entity51 has been well and truly rumbled , as the key piece of evidence is stuck on his head			0
as @entity51 hangs his head , and the tissue box , in shame , his owner says : ' @entity51 , did you do that ? i think you did ... ' luckily for @entity51 , his owner puts him out of his misery and removes the box that 's obstructing his view			2
someone 's in the dog house !			0

two identical dogs , one crime : a box of tissues ripped up on the floor

but the culprit *accidentally* reveals himself - the box is stuck on his head
