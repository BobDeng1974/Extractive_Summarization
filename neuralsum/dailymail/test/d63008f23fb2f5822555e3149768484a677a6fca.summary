he has long struggled to convince voters that he is a suitable choice for prime minister			2
now @entity3 has hired a leadership coaching firm that helps people overcome anxiety and find their ‘ inner voice ’			1
the consultants drafted in by the @entity10 claim to work with politicians to build ‘ leadership skills ’ using ‘ neuroscience ’ and ‘ business psychology ’			1
the firm , which uses some @entity17 spellings despite being based in @entity30 , details how it can help politicians on its website			2
it says : ‘ when we ’re working with leaders who want to communicate their messages with greater impact , it ’s typically the “ how ” of their style that we support , improving body language , breathing , posture and prosody			2
’ in a section entitled ‘ @entity45 ’ , it adds : ‘ is learning new communication techniques just a question of artifice rather than authenticity ? ‘ our answer to that question would be “ yes ” , if you do n’t throw yourself into the learning process and practice ! any new behaviour will feel inauthentic at the beginning , and will seem so to others , too			2
but with repeated practice we move from “ acting ” to “ being ”			0
’ when @entity3 tried to make a conference speech off the cuff in september , he forgot to mention the deficit and was roundly ridiculed			1
so ever since then he has made sure he always has one trusty aide at his side ... a lectern , right			0
whether he is in a town hall , a car park or a factory during the election campaign , the prop – often holding helpful notes to jog his memory – has been there for him to lean on			0
his advisors believe the lectern makes him look more like a prime minister - in - waiting			0
but its non-stop @entity30 tour has begun to look increasingly bizarre after he even dragged it into the car park of a @entity81 factory , where it was carefully positioned between puddles			0
this week he spoke from a lectern as he launched @entity10 campaign billboards in @entity86 , @entity87 ... even though he was in the middle of a cricket pitch			0
the website continues : ‘ the anxiety we all feel to different degrees when communicating an important message to others – and which can side - swipe our message – can be erased so that our inner voice can find its way into the world			2
’ and in a sign that the firm could help mr @entity3 prepare to negotiate post-election deals , it notes : ‘ our intelligent networks process encourages people to think about what they want to achieve [ and ] identify the people who might collaborate with them to achieve those goals			1
’ mr @entity3 has consistently lagged behind @entity18 in polls on their personal ratings during his five years as @entity10 leader			1
but he has seen a slight boost in his popularity since the campaign began last month			0
after the seven - way televised leaders ’ debate on @entity119 , it emerged that mr @entity3 had been reading from motivational notes – including one reminding him to be a ‘ happy warrior ’			1
his cribsheet , found in his dressing room after the clash , also prompted him to ‘ relish the chance to show who i am ’			0
mr @entity3 has hired @entity21 despite already employing @entity127 , a former adviser to @entity128 , on six figures			1
one labour mp said mr @entity127 had so far been ‘ invisible ’ in the campaign , adding : ‘ i do n’t understand what we are getting for the £ 300,000 , i think it is an obscene amount			0
’ mr @entity127 , who is based in the @entity17 , has insisted he is in touch with mr @entity3 ‘ all the time ’ by phone , text and email			1
asked yesterday whether his use of @entity21 had been ‘ helpful ’ , mr @entity3 told a press conference : ‘ i will let other people make a judgment on those questions			1
i take advice from a range of people			0
’ a @entity10 spokesman said : ‘ we do n’t comment on people we may or may not have employed			0
’ @entity21 did not respond to a request for comment			2
@entity151 @entity150 said : ‘ there ’s nothing authentic about @entity3 ... even after all his extensive coaching , could you imagine him standing up to @entity156 on the world stage ? he should ask for his money back			1

@entity3 is trying to build his ' leadership skills ' using psychology
he has hired a leadership coaching firm to help him feel less anxious
the firm @entity21 also tries to make its *clients* seem ' more authentic '
@entity3 had a note to remind him to be a ' happy warrior ' during a debate
