@entity1 players and staff took time away from their struggling @entity4 campaign to pose for a traditional team photo at @entity6			1
manager @entity7 took centre stage , surrounded by 26 squad members and almost as many staff - all of whom pulled such straight faces that it was barely possible to pick out a single smile between them			0
perhaps having @entity14 sat in front with his hands in full view kept things formal as the @entity20 firebrand has a history of upsetting his @entity23 teammates by pulling pranks during team photo sessions			2

while new signings including @entity64 , @entity76 and @entity65 took their places among teammates , there was one glaring omission from last season in the shape of @entity95			1
the @entity96 have struggled to maintain a title challenge without their former talisman - losing three of their opening six games and struggling to score while @entity84 has been ruled out with injury and @entity14 is still finding his form			1
@entity84 will miss wednesday 's trip to @entity104 for @entity1 's second @entity106 group game , while defender @entity63 was also omitted from the travelling party that left @entity109 on tuesday for their first @entity106 away game for five years			2
