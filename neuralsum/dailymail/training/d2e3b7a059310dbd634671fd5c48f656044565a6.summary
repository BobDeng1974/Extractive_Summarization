click here to read what @entity1 told @entity4 's @entity3 about @entity6 move @entity1 has become the best - paid pundit in @entity9 football by a distance after joining @entity11 as a football expert and ambassador from the start of next year			1
his pay packet is said to dwarf that of @entity6 colleague @entity17 , who is believed to be paid £ 1.2million a year			1
the terms of @entity1 ’s mega-deal still allow him to work for the @entity20 at major tournaments , as he did during @entity22 last summer			1
but he is not permitted to work for @entity6 ’s arch - rivals @entity23 , who were also keen on signing him			1
@entity1 has become the best - paid pundit in @entity9 football by a distance after joining @entity11 @entity1 's pay packet is said to dwarf that of @entity17 ( right ) , who is believed to be paid £ 1.2million a year @entity1 has shelved his coaching ambitions to accept a six - year deal with @entity6 , worth £ 4m a year			1
after two decades scoring goals , the 37 - year - old @entity32 said : ‘ it feels like a logical step			2
it gives me the possibility to stay close to the game and help people understand it better			0
’ he has in the past spoken of his desire to coach , and @entity45 manager @entity44 said the door would always be open for him at @entity45			1
@entity1 added : ‘ that is the plan , to go through that process , but we are far from that at the moment			1
everyone is busy at @entity45 and nobody is going to stop what they ’re doing for me			1
’ @entity1 joins the likes of @entity17 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 in the @entity11 stable			1
@entity1 moved from @entity61 to @entity45 in august 1999 for a fee of about £ 11m under @entity44 the @entity32 striker played for @entity64 , @entity61 , @entity45 , @entity65 and @entity66 during an illustrious career , scoring a total of 360 goals in 792 appearances			1
he also played for @entity71 on 123 occasions , scoring 51 times			0
@entity1 lifted the @entity75 title twice and the @entity76 three times before adding the @entity78 with @entity65 in 2009			2
he also won the @entity79 with @entity71 in 1998 and the @entity80 in 2000			2
@entity81 are understood to have spent more than £ 2m setting up the ‘ spogo ’ website as a tool to help browsers find local sports clubs			2
but just two years later , the site is being merged with a london 2012 legacy initiative be inspired because hardly anyone was using the @entity81 facility			0
this extravagance follows the eye - popping £ 3m a year @entity81 spent on their @entity92 , the expensive findings from which have been delayed because of botched data research			2
a @entity81 spokesman said : ‘ we believe the website merger makes sense because we can bring together facilities and people to better effect , and the @entity92 research is critical to our funding decisions			0
’ the @entity20 ’s website made its contribution to the general unease that has greeted the overwhelming size of @entity108 ’s victory over favourite @entity109 in the @entity111 vote			1
the first news the @entity20 put up online after the votes were counted was that @entity109 had won			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it was human error and was taken down immediately			0
’ the @entity20 mistakenly put online that @entity109 ( right ) had won @entity111 rather than actual winner @entity108 ( pictured centre next to third - placed @entity118 ) @entity119 , who was widely praised for his @entity121 captaincy , is already starting to prepare meticulously for leading @entity124 ’s 2016 @entity123 golf challenge , including visits to the unfinished course in @entity127			1
the professional focus of @entity119 , who took a tour of the @entity76 ’s @entity130 just to keep abreast of coaching ideas , contrasts with the shambolic @entity133 entry into rugby sevens that will not even name a manager until next year			2
@entity119 is already starting to prepare meticulously for leading @entity124 ’s 2016 @entity123 golf challenge @entity137 lure for @entity138 ? the departure from the @entity141 @entity81 managing director @entity139 has been inevitable since technical director designate @entity142 announced his vision to the @entity76 board after the @entity79			0
@entity142 ’s presentation of his ‘ @entity149 ’ blueprint for national teams was well received and allowed him effectively to take charge of the future direction of @entity81 football from @entity130			2
@entity139 , who was also impressed by @entity142 ’s talk , realised club @entity81 — which he had led since its formation in 2010 — had been kicked into the long grass and it crystallised his desire to leave the @entity76			0
the departure from the @entity141 @entity81 managing director @entity139 had been inevitable @entity139 declared before the @entity79 that his ambition is to be a club chief executive and had always seen 2014 as his likely leaving date			0
a negotiated settlement gives him time to find the right football post			0
but he will have no difficulty picking up a top pr job after his consummate work in his other role as @entity76 director of communications handling crisis after crisis at @entity172			0
@entity139 ’s @entity174 post has been made virtually redundant , meaning the replacement for general secretary @entity176 , who will leave at the end of next month , will have to involve himself closely with @entity81 matters			0
@entity139 shows @entity180 president @entity179 around @entity181 during a visit last month meanwhile , the pressure is now firmly on @entity184 , not the easiest @entity76 chairman to work with , to steady the ship following the exits of @entity176 and @entity139 in quick succession			0
members of @entity191 ’s executive committee , led by @entity193 ’s @entity192 , calling for @entity195 ’s @entity79 corruption report to be published in full will find their cause made that much harder by the @entity191 appeals committee rejecting @entity195 ’s complaint that the summary of his report was ‘ incomplete and erroneous ’			0
the appeal was considered inadmissible because by the statement by ethics judge @entity203 was not legally binding , and thus not subject to appeal			0
