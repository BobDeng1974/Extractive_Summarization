the majority of those who complained said the advert , which was shown from 6.45pm , should not have been aired before 9pm as it would give children a ‘ negative impact on their body image ’			1
the ad showed three people whose lives were ‘ transformed ’ by cosmetic surgery			1

the @entity81 did not uphold the complaint that the ad ‘ trivialised cosmetic surgery ’ or that it ‘ implied that life ’s happiness could be achieved through cosmetic surgery ’			1
it did , however , rule that the ad breached guidelines on when it could be shown and judged it to be irresponsible and harmful to children watching			2
' we considered it likely that many young teenagers would identify with such negative feelings about their physical appearance ' @entity81 the @entity81 said : ' we were concerned that children , and in particular young teenagers , were likely to interpret the ad differently to adult viewers			1
' the ad featured three characters who were depicted as unhappy with their appearance			0
' the depictions of their sudden physical transformations were accompanied by an instant and dramatic change in their emotional wellbeing			0

it said : ' the first woman did not like the appearance of her nose and was shown using make - up in an attempt to tone down how it looked , but she did not feel satisfied with this and so opted for cosmetic surgery			1
' the man felt physically uncomfortable with how his teeth looked and felt it was affecting his ability to speak whilst presenting to work colleagues			0
' the second woman would like to be able to wear clothing that would suit a fuller bust			0
