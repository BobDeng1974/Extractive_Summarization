# brianwilliamsmisremembers : following the news anchor 's shocking admission wednesday , social media users began photoshopping @entity0 into famous historical events , like @entity15 's car chase ( via @ linkcalhoun ) @entity0 to thank ? @ @entity22 thinks @entity0 might remember it			1
with a photo of the newsman cropped hastily into a shot from that famous day , they write in the voice of @entity0 : ' i said @entity30 , do you dream ? , he said yes			2
i said , ' well , tell the folks about your dreams ' or at the @entity34 in 1963 , where he personally encouraged @entity36 to give his @entity38 speech			2
at least that 's how @ @entity22 thinks @entity0 might remember it			1
with a photo of the newsman cropped hastily into a shot from that famous day , they write in the voice of @entity0 : ' i said @entity30 , do you dream ? , he said yes			2
i said , ' well , tell the folks about your dreams ' @ @entity45 also places @entity0 at the @entity46			2
' losing to @entity47 in @entity48 was tough , but i knew i was part of history , ' @entity0 ' misremembers			2
' twitter user @ robx_d puts @entity0 both alongside @entity52 before her faithful voyage and looking on as the flag was raised at @entity55			1

' i made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago			1
i want to apologize ' he said			0
in a lengthy @entity89 post on wednesday @entity0 admitted his mistake and blamed the ‘ fog of memory over 12 years ’ for his error			1
‘ i feel terrible about making this mistake , especially since i found my own writing about the incident from back in ' 08 , and i was indeed on the @entity97 behind the bird that took the rpg in the tail housing just above the ramp , ’ he wrote			0
‘ because i have no desire to fictionalize my experience ( we all saw it happened the first time ) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened , i think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area -- and the fog of memory over 12 years -- made me conflate the two , and i apologize			1
’ twitter user @ robx_d also puts @entity0 alongside the flag as it was raised at @entity55 reporting live from the moon : " that one live shot i did from the moon " # @entity121 ( via @entity123 ) saving private @entity0 ? @ @entity124 puts @entity0 in the 1998 classic @entity126 film since the 2003 incident , @entity0 ’ chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter 's role seems to have grown			1
@entity1 reported the incident on march 26 , 2003 , with the headline , ' @entity5 : helicopter @entity1 ’s @entity0 was riding in @entity134			1
' however when the incident was reported the next day by the @entity137 it stated that a ‘ chopper was hit and forced to land			0
then the one carrying @entity0 landed			0
’ three days later @entity139 carried a similar report that stated : ' @entity1 's @entity0 was stranded in the @entity142 desert for three days after a @entity97 helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket - propelled grenade			1
' the grenade just missed , but it forced the group to make an emergency landing			2
luckily , a @entity150 tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters , killing four @entity142			0
' in a 2007 entry from his blog @entity0 recounts how he was part of a ‘ flotilla of four twin - rotor chinook helicopters ’			0
‘ some men on the ground fired an rpg through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours			0
' there was small arms fire			0
… all four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor , ’ he recalled			2
by the next year @entity0 was claiming on his blog that ' all four of our low - flying chinooks took fire			0
' ' the @entity97 flying in front of ours ( from the @entity176 ) took an rpg to the rear rotor , as all four of our low - flying chinooks took fire , ' he wrote			0
' we were forced down and stayed down -- for the better ( or worse ) part of 3 days and 2 nights			0
' the tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on the @entity185			0
by now @entity0 is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his			0
‘ two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one i was in , ’ he told @entity187			0
