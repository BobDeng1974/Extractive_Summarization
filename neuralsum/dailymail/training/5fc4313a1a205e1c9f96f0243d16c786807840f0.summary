the @entity0 is blowing huge , mysterious bubbles that stretch for tens of thousands of light years			2
these ' @entity4 ' bubbles , which are mostly made up of gamma rays , were discovered four years ago by @entity7 physicist @entity8 - and scientists have been trying to explain them ever since			1
now a group of @entity12 researchers has used data from the @entity14 to create a ' portrait ' two bubbles stretching out above and below our galaxy			2
the bubbles themselves , he claims , glow in nearly uniform gamma rays and appear like two 30,000 - light - year - tall incandescent bulbs screwed into the centre of the galaxy			1
but according to current astrophysical theories , these gamma rays should n't be there , and scientists have been unable to find a source			1
there are a number of theories			0
for example , they could have been created by huge jets of accelerated matter blasting out from the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy			2
the bubbles extend 30,000 light - years across			1
hints of the bubbles ' edges were first seen in x-rays ( blue )			0
the gamma rays mapped by @entity4 ( shown in magenta ) extend much farther from the galaxy 's plane or they could have been formed by a population of giant stars , born from the plentiful gas surrounding the black hole , all exploding as supernovae at roughly the same time			1
another theory is they are the result of collisions between dark matter particles that result in their annihilation , emitting charged particles in the process			0

' there are several models that explain them , but none of the models is perfect , ' said @entity22 , a postdoctoral researcher at the @entity23			0

' the bubbles are rather mysterious			0
' from the vantage point of most @entity109 - bound telescopes , all but the highest - energy gamma rays are completely screened out by our atmosphere			1
it was n't until the era of orbiting gamma - ray observatories like @entity4 that scientists discovered how common extra-terrestrial gamma rays really are			1
pulsars , supermassive black holes in other galaxies and supernovae are all gamma rays point sources , like distant stars are point sources of visible light , and all those gamma rays had to be scrubbed from the @entity4 data			1
hardest to remove were the galactic diffuse emissions , a gamma ray fog that fills the galaxy from cosmic rays interacting with interstellar particles			1
' subtracting all those contributions did n't subtract the bubbles , ' said @entity23 postdoctoral researcher @entity134			0
' the bubbles do exist and their properties are robust			0
' in other words , the bubbles do n't disappear when other gamma - ray sources are pulled out of the @entity4 data â€“ in fact , they stand out quite clearly			1
the researchers plan to continue to gather data on the bubbles , while attempting to explain how they got there			0
a giant gamma - ray structure was discovered by processing @entity4 all - sky data at energies from 1 to 10 billion electron volts , shown here			1
the dumbbell - shaped feature ( centre ) emerges from the galactic core and extends 50 degrees north and south from the plane of the @entity0 , in the sky from the constellation @entity157			0

scientists have created a data - based ' portrait ' of two massive bubbles
these @entity4 bubbles , they claim , glow in nearly uniform gamma rays
they appear like two 30,000 - light - year bulbs screwed into galaxy 's centre
but according to astrophysical theories , these gamma ray bubbles should n't be there , and scientists are still baffled by their *presence*
