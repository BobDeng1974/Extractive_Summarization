at a dinner @entity2 hosted for reporters and bloggers , waiters served cuisine prepared by celebrity chefs using ingredients from the chain 's menu			1
a kung pao chicken appetizer was made with @entity11 doused in sweet and sour sauce and garnished with parsley			0
slow - cooked beef was served with gnocchi fashioned out of @entity19 's french fries and a fruit sauce from its smoothie mix. for dessert , its biscuit mix was used to make a pumpkin spice ' biznut , ' a biscuit - doughnut hybrid			1
the event , held in @entity29 's @entity28 neighborhood , was billed ' a transforming dining experience of " fast food " to " good food served fast			1
" ' attendees tweeted out photos and the night was written up on various websites			0
file - in this july 21 , 2010 file photo , people make their way past the @entity19 's restaurant at @entity41 in @entity42			1
@entity43 understands its reputation for serving cheap , greasy fare is a growing liability and is trying to change in a variety of ways			2
( @entity50 photo / @entity51 , file ) the dishes are n't intended for @entity19 's restaurants			1
instead , the evening is part of a campaign by @entity2 to shake its reputation for serving cheap , unhealthy food			2
at a time when @entity61 are playing closer attention to what they eat , the company is trying to sway public opinion by first reaching out to the reporters , bloggers and other so - called ' influencers ' who write and speak about @entity19 's			1
it 's just one way @entity2 is trying to change its image			2
in the past 18 months , the chain has introduced the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches and rolled out chicken wraps as its first menu item with cucumbers			1
last fall , it announced plans to give people the choice of a salad instead of fries in combo meals			2
and in coming months , mandarins will be offered in happy meals , with other fruits being explored as well			0
@entity19 's declined to make an executive available for this story , but ceo @entity89 said early this year : ' we 've got to make sure that the food is relevant and that the awareness around @entity19 's as a kitchen and a restaurant that cooks and prepares fresh , high quality food is strong and pronounced			1
' the company faces an uphill battle , especially if the past is any indication			0
the salads it introduced more than a decade ago account for just two to three per cent of sales			0
and the chain last year discontinued its @entity105 salad and premium @entity107 burgers , which analysts said were priced too high for @entity2 's customers at around $ 5			2
the problem is that some simply people do n't consider @entity19 's a place to get high quality food , in part because the prices are so low			1
and while @entity19 's has added salads and a yogurt parfait to its menu over the years , @entity61 are gravitating toward other attributes , like organic produce and meat raised without antibiotics			1
file - in this wednesday , sept. 12 , 2012 , file photo , @entity124 and @entity125 eat breakfast at a @entity19 's restaurant , in @entity29			1
@entity43 understands its reputation for serving cheap , greasy fare is a growing liability and is trying to change in a variety of ways			2
( @entity50 photo / @entity137 , file ) file - in this jan. 26 , 2009 file photo , @entity19 's employee @entity139 hands a patron a salad at the drive up window at @entity2 in @entity146 , @entity19 ¿ s understands its reputation for serving cheap , greasy fare is a growing liability and is trying to change in a variety of ways			1
( @entity50 photo / @entity151 , file ) ' people just do n't think of @entity19 's as having that premium quality , ' said @entity154 , a restaurant industry analyst with @entity155			1
in some ways , the image @entity19 's is battling is ironic , given its reputation for exacting standards with suppliers			2
@entity89 has also noted the ingredients tend to be fresh because restaurants go through them so quickly			0
' the produce and the products that we have at breakfast and across the menu are fresher than — no disrespect intended — what most of you have in your refrigerators , ' he said at an analyst conference in may			0
but even that reputation for supply chain rigor was recently tarnished when the chain 's longtime supplier was reported to have sold expired meat to its restaurants in @entity182			0
the low - cost burgers , ice - cream cones and other food that made @entity19 's so popular since it was founded in 1955 have come to define it			1
and some people ca n't get over the idea that low prices equal low quality			0
' it 's the whole perception people get when you sell something cheaply , ' said @entity196 , who used to own @entity19 's restaurants in @entity198 and now runs a consulting firm for franchisees			2
@entity202 , for instance , said she eats at @entity2 because she can get a burger , fries and drink for about $ 5			0
but @entity202 , a @entity29 resident , does n't think there are any healthy options there			0
' basically , it 's junk food , ' she said			2
adding to its challenge , @entity2 ca n't seem to raise prices without driving people away			0
pressured by rising costs for beef and other ingredients , the chain tried to move away from the @entity217 in 2012 with an ' @entity218 ' where items were priced at around $ 2			0
but customers are apparently righteous about the $ 1 price point , and the strategy was scrapped			0
last year , @entity19 's changed its tactic a bit , hoping not to turn off customers			1
it tweaked the name of the ' @entity217 ' to the ' @entity217 & more			0
' in this sept. 26 2013 photo , staff members prepare dishes of slow - cooked beef served with gnocchi fashioned out of @entity234 s french fries and a fruit sauce from its smoothie mix during a dinner hosted by @entity2 for reporters and bloggers , in @entity29			1
the evening was part of a stealth campaign @entity242 s is waging to shake its image for serving junk food			1
at a time when @entity61 are growing more finicky about what they eat , the company is hoping to sway public opinion by first winning over the reporters , bloggers and other so - called ¿ influencers ¿ who tweet , write , and speak on tv			0
( @entity50 photo / @entity253 ) @entity19 's low prices also are part of what keeps it from competing with places such as @entity259 , which is touting the removal of genetically modified ingredients from its menu , and @entity263 , which recently said it will eliminated all artificial ingredients by 2016			1
such moves would be herculean feats for @entity19 's , given its pricing model and the complexity of its menu			1
meanwhile , the company acknowledges there are problems with how people perceive its food			0
' a lot of our guests do n't believe our food is real , ' said @entity279 , director of culinary innovation at @entity2 , in an interview last year			0
the image of @entity19 's food is a growing concern for the company at a time when @entity61 sales have been weak for two years			1
the last time @entity2 managed to boost a monthly sales figure at home was in october , and the company warns its performance is n't expected to improve anytime soon			0
@entity19 's has said it has other problems , including slow and inaccurate service at its restaurants			1
but improving perceptions about its food is also a priority			0
following the dinner in @entity29 last fall , the company hosted a similar event last month for reporters covering the @entity304 in @entity305			2
beignets filled with grilled chicken and dusted with sugar were served alongside a packet of @entity19 's honey mustard sauce			1
other ' chef events ' in local markets are planned for coming months , according to @entity313 , a @entity19 's spokeswoman			1
she declined to provide details but said the events will be a spin on a recent contest between two friends to make a gourmet dish out of a @entity321 meal			0
@entity313 said @entity19 's was n't associated with that particular contest , which was posted online			2
the company continues to tweak the menu , too			0
the new @entity326 burger @entity2 is promoting comes on a brioche bun and looks more like something that might be found at a trendy burger joint			0
it costs $ 5 or $ 6 , depending on where you live , making it the most expensive sandwich on the menu			0
in @entity334 , @entity19 's also is testing a ' @entity336 ' concept , with the patties being cooked to order more slowly on a separate grill			2
beyond the menu , the company is determined to take control of its narrative			0
' we 're going to start really , really telling our story in a much more proactive manner , ' said @entity346 , @entity61 brand and strategy officer for @entity19 's said late last year			2
he added that @entity19 's has gone too long in ' letting other folks frame the story for us			1

@entity19 's held a dinner in @entity29 serving menu items transformed into other dishes by celebrity chefs
the dinner was part of @entity19 's attempt to change perceptions of its food
the restaurant wants customers to see its food as ' good food served fast , ' instead of cheap junk food
the company has added several new menu items over the last 18 months including egg - white *mcmuffins* and the option of salad instead of fries
