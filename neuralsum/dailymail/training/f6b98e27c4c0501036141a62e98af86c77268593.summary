earlier this week a pilot and his co-pilot spotted a mysterious orange and red glow while flying over the @entity3			1
the strange lights baffled the pilots , with no obvious explanation available			2
but a @entity8 researcher has told @entity9 that he thinks the answer may lie in an ' energised bubble ' in @entity13 's atmosphere caused by either solar wind , a powerful microwave beam or even a controversial research station in @entity17			1
strange lights have been spotted near the @entity20 peninsula of @entity21 ( image by @entity24 pilot @entity23 )			1
the sighting was made by pilots flying from @entity27 to @entity17			1
the glow came about 20 minutes after a vertical lightning bolt was seen the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) is an ionospheric research program in @entity17			1
it is funded by the @entity34 , the @entity35 , the @entity36 and the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			0
its purpose is to analyse the ionosphere and investigate the use of ionspheric enhancement technology			0
its main instrument is the @entity30 ( @entity45 ) , a high - power radio frequency transmitter facility			0
@entity31 has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories			0
it has been blamed for hurricanes , thunderstorms , major power outages and more , but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims			0
' i could imagine that something from the solar wind , possibly a small highly energised bubble that penetrated the protective shield of the magnetosphere , hit the @entity13 's uppermost atmosphere and produced this very local effect , ' @entity8 researcher dr @entity55 , told @entity9			1
' alternatively the ionospheric research station @entity31 [ @entity30 ] in @entity17 might have sent some powerful microwave beams to the ionosphere and created this local instability			1
' @entity31 is an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the @entity34 , the @entity35 , the @entity36 , and the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			0
it was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance			2
the station regularly uses a tool called the @entity30 ( @entity45 ) , a high - power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band			2
it is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the @entity83			0
@entity31 has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories			0
it has been blamed for hurricanes , thunderstorms , major power outages and more , but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims			0
the strange lights were spotted south of the @entity20 peninsula @entity21 during the flight of a @entity95 747 - 8 from @entity27 to @entity96 , @entity17			1
previously , it has been thought that they may have originated from the explosion of a huge volcano under the surface of the ocean			0
on the nature of the lights themselves , dr @entity55 adds : ' the dominant colours in the photographs are green and red			0
' the green appears to be the same as aurora lights which are known to arise from an electronically highly excited state of oxygen atoms , decaying to the ground state by emitting light at 557.7 nanometres			0
' the red appears to be likely due to atomic oxygen emitting at 630 nanometres			0
' in both cases energetic particles , probably electrons , hit the oxygen atoms and caused them to become electronically excited			0
' @entity8 astronomer dr @entity55 says the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) in @entity17 may have been the cause			1
its purpose is to analyse the ionosphere			0
its main instrument is the @entity30 ( @entity45 ) , a high - power radio frequency transmitter facility ( shown ) after the initial vertical lightning bolt it was thought the phenomenon could have been a thunderstorm , but that was ruled out when none were reported in the area			1
the favoured theory by pilot @entity23 at the moment is that the lights were caused by an underwater volcano			1
such eruptions are not unprecedented ; on 21 november 2013 an submarine volcano famously created a new ' island ' off the coast of @entity145			0
another explanation is they were caused by lights from fishing boats			1
last week astronaut @entity150 was left baffled by a similarly bizarre green flurry of lights ( shown below ) off the coast of @entity154 , created by fishing boats using led lights to attract squid			1
however that explanation has been ruled out for the latest mystery glow , as more than 50 boats would be needed to produce light of this magnitude - but no fleet of fishing boats was thought to be operating in the area			1
@entity24 pilot @entity166 explained on @entity167 how , five hours into the ten - hour flight , they spotted an intense flash of light like a lightning bolt , directed vertically up in the distance			1
this was then followed by a deep red and orange glow 20 minutes later			1
and the experience left van @entity23 somewhat perturbed , owing to the lack of an explanation for what happened			2
‘ last night over the @entity3 , somewhere @entity182 of the @entity20 peninsula @entity21 i experienced the creepiest thing so far in my flying career , ’ he said			1
there were no thunderstorms on their route or weather - radar , suggesting the lightning did not originate in a storm			2
the glow is also a mystery ; similar lights have been spotted from squid - fishing - boats , but van @entity23 says this ‘ would not make sense in this area ’			1
‘ the closer we got , the more intense the glow became , illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow , in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water , ’ he continued			0
‘ the only cause of this red glow that we could think of , was the explosion of a huge volcano just underneath the surface of the ocean , about 30 minutes before we overflew that exact position			2
’ he was then nervous of encountering an ash - plume in the middle of the night , but fortunately they did not encounter anything of the sort			0
before the flight they had heard via radio about earthquakes in @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227			0
but despite their being a few volcanoes on their route , they had had not been alerted to any new activity - although this does n't necessarily include unseen underwater volcanoes			2
the strange lights ( shown at the pink dot ) were spotted south of the @entity20 peninsula @entity21 during a flight from @entity27 to @entity96 , @entity17 ( flight path in blue ) @entity240 ruled out squid - fishing - boats as the origin			1
he says the cause may have been an underwater volcano			2
an ongoing investigation is taking place to find out what happened together with his co-pilot van @entity23 says they felt ‘ everything but comfortable ’ , while no other aircraft were nearby to confirm the sighting			1
‘ we reported our observations to @entity255 and an investigation into what happened in this remote region of the ocean is now started , ’ he added			2
‘ now i 'm just hoping that if a new island has been formed there [ from the eruption ] , at least it can be named after me as the official discoverer			0
‘ that would be pretty cool ! ’ ‘ the closer we got , the more intense the glow became , illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow , in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water , ’ said van @entity23 around the @entity3 is a region known as the @entity276 , where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur that may have been the origin of glow			2
the horseshoe shape is 25,000 miles ( 40,000 km ) and , with 452 volcanoes , is home to more than 75 per cent of the planet 's active and dormant volcanoes			0

earlier this week *unexplained* lights were spotted near @entity21 , @entity20
however a @entity8 researcher has offered his explanation , suggesting an energised bubble in the atmosphere could have been the origin
he says this may have been cause by solar wind or a microwave beam
but it also could have *resulted* from the @entity305 research station in @entity17
the sighting was made by pilots flying from @entity27 to @entity17
the glow came about 20 minutes after a vertical lightning bolt was seen
@entity24 pilot @entity23 ruled out squid - fishing - boats as the origin
he said the cause may have been an underwater volcano
an ongoing investigation is taking place to find out what happened
