by @entity0 published : 17:09 est , 26 june 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 27 june 2013 war on the welfare state : chancellor @entity3 in the @entity4 yesterday where he announced a further £ 11.5billion cut to benefits @entity3 went to war on the bloated welfare state and public sector wage bill yesterday			1
savaging the ‘ vested interests ’ that have opposed his spending cuts so far , the chancellor put benefit cuts at the heart of the next election campaign			1
he set out plans to extend austerity into the next @entity19 with £ 11.5 billion in fresh reductions , making it a key battleground for the general election in 2015			0
he announced a new cap on the overall welfare bill , a requirement for foreign benefit claimants to learn @entity28 and a seven - day wait before the jobless can sign on			1
the pain for millions of workers in the public sector will continue as they lose automatic pay rises awarded for time served			1
another 144,000 jobs will be axed			0
however , government spending will still account for 43.1 per cent of national output in 2015/16 – little change from the 43.6 per cent of 2012			0
‘ while recovery from such a deep recession can never be straightforward , @entity50 is moving out of intensive care – and from rescue to recovery , ’ he said			1
the chancellor fiercely attacked @entity62 and the unions , telling mps : ‘ every step of the way , every penny saved , every programme reformed , every entitlement reduced , every difficult choice taken , has been opposed by vested interests and those who got @entity50 into this mess in the first place			0
‘ we will not let up			0
i will not let that happen			0
’ at the heart of yesterday ’s spending review was the chancellor ’s argument that it is possible to roll back the state and get better public services at lower cost			1
he pointed to police reform and immigration where , despite lower budgets , crime and net migration have fallen dramatically			0
‘ what was the prediction from the opposition three years ago ? crime would rise			0
and what has happened instead ? crime is at its lowest level for 30 years , net migration down by more than a third , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
‘ the home secretary is demonstrating that responsible budgets and reform can deliver better services for the public			1
’ less money for better services ? to back up his economic argument the chancellor pointed to police reform and immigration where , despite lower budgetss , crime and net migration have fallen dramatically public spending , the chancellor insisted , does not create sustainable growth			1
‘ enterprise does , ’ he said			0
‘ and the job of the state is to provide the schools , science , transport links and reliable energy that enable business to grow			1
‘ @entity50 was once the place where the future was invented : from the railway to jet engine to the world wide web			0
we can be that country again			0
’ got off lightly : @entity131 's @entity130 got off relatively lightly with cuts of 6 per cent and a big increase in science spending he said the @entity135 had reduced the deficit by a third , put a record number of people into work and brought the economy back from the brink of bankruptcy			1
he confirmed total expenditure would continue to fall in real terms at the same rate as it is doing today , reaching £ 745billion in 2015			0
but the economic downturn has meant higher than expected debt interest payments and welfare payments , even though spending is being slashed in most government departments			0
the @entity153 , the @entity151 and the @entity152 were among the hardest hit in the latest spending round , with 10 per cent budget cuts in 2015/16			1
@entity131 ’s @entity130 , the last to reach a deal with the @entity151 after tough negotiations , got off relatively lightly with cuts of 6 per cent and a big increase in science spending			2
however , student grants will be frozen			0
@entity62 had previously suggested it would not reverse the spending cuts announced for 2015 - 16 , although it would borrow money to invest in infrastructure spending			2
but yesterday shadow chancellor @entity165 said that ‘ in terms of the overall numbers of 15 - 16 , i think the cuts are deeper than they need to be ’			1
mr @entity165 attacked an ‘ out - of - touch chancellor ’ who had ‘ failed on living standards , growth and the deficit , and families and businesses are paying the price for his failure ’			1
‘ if the chancellor continues with his failing economic plan , then it will fall to the next @entity62 government to turn the economy round and to take the tough decisions to get the deficit down in a fair way , ’ he said			2
not impressed : shadow chancellor @entity165 , centre , attacked an ' out - of - touch chancellor ' who had ' failed on living standards , growth and the deficit , and families and businesses are paying the price for his failure ' @entity62 suggested that it would back @entity196 language tests for migrants and would ‘ look at the detail ’ of other benefit changes			2
@entity200 , of the @entity201 , said there was a ‘ good chance ’ that whoever wins the election will put up taxes rather than pursuing even more spending cuts			2
much spending would be one third or more down in real terms from 2010 if austerity continued at the same pace until 2017 , he said			0
‘ the scale of the cuts are really astonishing , ’ mr @entity200 said			2
‘ so , if i was a betting man i would think there would be some kind of tax rises after the election			0
’ @entity218 , chief economist at the @entity219 , said : ‘ the spending review leaves business feeling like @entity222 – more please , chancellor			2
‘ please could you go further and faster with spending restraint ? please could you shift even more expenditure from current spending towards infrastructure ? ‘ please could you widen the welfare cap to include pensions ? but please could you also do less ring - fencing of spending in departments such as the @entity233 ? ’ but @entity234 , general secretary of the @entity236 union , said : ‘ @entity3 ’s comprehensive spending review offers no hope and no growth and will cast the @entity50 into economic gloom for the next decade			1
