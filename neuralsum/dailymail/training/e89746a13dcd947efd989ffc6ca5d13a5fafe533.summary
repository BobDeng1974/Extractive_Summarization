factories and businesses will be paid to turn out their lights between 4pm and 8pm under emergency measures designed to head off the threat of blackouts next winter			1
they will be asked to save energy by halting production during the peak period for households if high demand caused by unusually harsh weather puts families at risk of being plunged into darkness			0

lights out : industry watchdog @entity17 has decided the plan is necessary to ensure an adequate supply of electricity and prevent the lights going out in homes but the cost of running the scheme , if it needs to be implemented , is bound to fall on the shoulders of consumers through their bills			1
the measures would also inevitably affect the nation ’s productivity , thereby harming the economic recovery			2
they are needed because many coal and gas - fired power stations are being closed or mothballed to meet government promises to cut carbon emissions			0
at the same time , not enough wind turbines are being built to cover the resulting fall in @entity46 ’s electricity - generating capacity			2
hundreds of firms could sign up to the scheme , with the @entity49 giving them a total of around £ 10million for agreeing to take part			0
the bill could double or treble if the requirement to cut energy use is triggered			0
the system of payments will only kick in if winters are particularly harsh and demand from households rises as a result			0

' how are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having @entity84 levels of reliability for power ? ' @entity87 , @entity74 its director , @entity87 , said : ‘ these are , in effect , emergency measures to deal with the possibility of electricity shortages until new supply comes on line			1
’ he said that the scheme was a necessary response to the situation , but added : ‘ this ca n’t be a sustainable way of managing the energy system			0
we should not be in this situation			0
' @entity17 has been warning governments about the threat to supply margins for many years			1
but the changes to the energy market , such as the building of new nuclear power stations , is coming too late			0
