what is the biggest concern for a @entity3 veteran , with no formal managerial experience , preparing to lead another country 's team out in front of 30,000 of his baying compatriots ? ' suit or tracksuit ? ' jokes @entity13 's interim head coach @entity12 , who will attempt to guide @entity15 's newest member to an historic result at @entity17 on sunday			1
he adds : ' growing up in @entity19 , it 's a boyhood dream to step out at @entity17 for your country			1
but to step out for another country against your own country … i 'm totally mixed with emotions			1
@entity12 ( centre ) was born in @entity19 but is the current @entity13 interim head coach ' i 'm massively humbled , yet there 's a little devil on my other shoulder saying , ' what are you doing ? people might never speak to you again '			1
' but the 41 - year - old freely admits it would take a very poor performance from @entity39 's men for his charges to leave @entity41 with anything more than pride			2
@entity12 , part - time head coach , part - time exercise rehabilitation officer , was on the books at @entity46 during his teens , but decided the @entity3 offered a more realistic opportunity			1
after two decades at sea , @entity13 was to be his final port of call , and he has an obvious fondness for the @entity54 territory			1
' i miss the @entity57 scenery but where i am now ticks the boxes , ' he says			1
' after 21 years travelling the world , i 've found somewhere i feel is home			2
' the former assistant head coach , who was handed the reins just three weeks ago , is enjoying every minute of his adventure but the national anthems will throw up an unusual dilemma			1
' how do you stop a @entity68 singing flower of @entity19 ? you ca n't , ' he admits			1
' if it was @entity72 i 'd be on the table singing it like i meant it ! at @entity17 i 'll be singing it , but i do n't have to show that passion			0
@entity19 are heavy favourites for the clash and will be expecting to vastly improve their goal difference ' i 'll be passionate during the @entity13 national anthem			1
i 've sung it every game for the last two and a half years and i 've felt the hairs rise on my arm			2
on sunday i 'll feel the hairs rise for both anthems			0
' @entity13 are close to the @entity57 in terms of being passionate about who they are			1
as a nation , @entity19 feel they 're not given the freedom they deserve , @entity13 is the same			1
' the debutant manager must prepare his squad with only three professional footballers			0
their occupations range from policemen and firemen to solicitors and customs officers			0
how must @entity12 have felt when his team lined up against the @entity105 in @entity106 last november ? he says : ' as world champions , they were expected to trounce us			2
i listened to @entity112 's commentary and , when @entity113 scored the first goal , he said , ' i 'm fully expecting the @entity105 to put on a cricket score tonight '			0
( they won 4 - 0 )			2
you could see it in their manager 's face when we had a shot at goal , and a second shot at goal and a corner			0
@entity19 duo @entity130 ( right ) and @entity131 train ahead of their side 's forthcoming clash ' we 've got to build for the next 10 or 20 years			1
we wo n't find a @entity135 in a country of 30,000 — there will be more people in the crowd on sunday than in our entire country			0
' @entity12 would clearly relish the chance to oversee @entity13 's development on a permanent basis			1
' it 's starting to sit better on my shoulders , ' he says			0
' i feel confident in my ability and now i 'm thinking , ' why not me ? '			0
if i was offered the job i 'd bite their hand off			0
' but whatever happens , @entity12 will always have his place in history			2
' not even you journalists could have written this story , ' he says			0
' if nothing happens after sunday 's game i 'll always have this memory			2
' i 'll tell my grandkids , ' you know , your grandad managed a football team once '			0
they 'd laugh — ' of course you did grandad			0
now tell us another @entity3 story			0

@entity12 is the interim head coach at *minnows* @entity13
the @entity57 - born coach has mixed emotions ahead of the game
@entity19 are currently third in group d of the @entity176 *qualifiers*
