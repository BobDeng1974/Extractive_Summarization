on @entity2 , free - burning and smouldering fire can usually be put out with water			2
but in space – where there is no up or down – fire behaves in bizarre ways creating spheres of floating flames			0
now , a new @entity12 recently posted by astronaut @entity13 , has revealed this incredible phenomenon in action			1
flames in space burn with a lower temperature , at a lower rate , and with less oxygen than in normal gravity			0
this means that materials used to extinguish the fire must be present in higher concentrations			0
the slow flow of air from the fans mixing the air in a spacecraft can make the flames burn even faster			0
to help understand how flames burn in space , @entity33 researchers ignite a small drop of either heptane or methanol			1
as this little sphere of fuel burns for about 20 seconds , it is engulfed by a spherically symmetric flame			1
the droplet shrinks until either the flame extinguishes or the fuel runs out			1
‘ a floating sphere of fire comes alive in @entity53 – may lead to better engines on @entity2 , ’ wrote the 38 - year - old from @entity47 who is currently serving as flight engineer aboard the @entity50			1
on the @entity50 - which is the size of an american football field - putting out even a small fire quickly is a life - and - death matter			2
for several years , @entity60 's @entity59 , or @entity33 , has conducted more than 200 tests to better understand the fundamentals of flames and how to control them in microgravity			0

the droplet shrinks until either the flame extinguishes or the fuel runs out flames in space burn with a lower temperature , at a lower rate , and with less oxygen than in normal gravity when a flame burns on @entity2 , heated gases rise from the fire creating a buoyant flow that draws oxygen into the flame and combustion products away from it			1
this creates a flame shape			0
‘ in space molecular diffusion draws oxygen to the flame and combustion products away from the flame at a rate 100 times slower than the buoyant flow on @entity2 , ’ @entity90 , project scientist , @entity60 ’s @entity91 , said			2

@entity125 ( @entity33 - 2 ) is the second iteration of the @entity33 experiment and requires the flaming droplets to be suspended , free of other objects			0
this allows astronauts to better study the rate at which fuel mixtures evaporate and burn , as well as understating the conditions required for soot to form			2
@entity60 claims that ‘ understanding these processes could lead to the production of a safer spacecraft as well as increased fuel efficiency for engines using liquid fuel on @entity2			1

the @entity145 ( pictured here ) has helped them do this @entity60 astronaut @entity13 , ( right ) waves goodbye to his two daughters as he prepares to board the @entity152 rocket at the @entity154 leased @entity153 in @entity155 in may			2

@entity12 was posted by astronaut @entity13 while on board the @entity50
he ignited a small drop of either heptane or methanol as part of study
as this sphere of fuel burns , it is engulfed by a symmetric flame
droplet shrinks until either the flame extinguishes or the fuel runs out
experiments could *someday* lead to safer spacecraft as well as increased fuel efficiency for engines using liquid fuel on @entity2
