at first glance it looks like a scene from a @entity4 horror movie			0
the tip of the dorsal fin breaking the water , thrashing around as it enjoys a feeding frenzy just a few feet away from a group of swimmers			2
but in fact these bathers were in no danger at @entity16 beach in @entity17 because the giant pictured circling them yesterday was a harmless basking shark			1
these toothless gentle giants are one of three shark species to feed only on plankton , the other two being the whale shark and the megamouth shark the 16ft fish was pictured filter feeding just yards away from swimmers who were lucky enough to have the chance close encounter			1
photographer @entity31 took the pictures saying neither the shark nor the swimmers were in any danger			1
' it was a very peaceful scene , ' she said			0
' the shark just carried on feeding and completely ignored the swimmers			2
' basking sharks are normally seen feeding off the coast of @entity42 and @entity17 and the west of the @entity44 throughout the spring and summer			1
undeterred by the sheer size of the animal , the brave swimmers try to get a better look the enormous fish , which have been protected since 1998 , are the largest in @entity44 waters and the second largest in the world , after the whale shark			1
the evasive fish tend to swim deep in the ocean , but from may to october they come to the surface to feed on plankton blooms			2
this year , however , sightings in the south west have not been so frequent , according to ms @entity31			2
' i have n't seen many basking sharks this year			0
for some reason it looks like it may be a quiet year			0
' @entity65 music : it may look like a dangerous scene from a @entity4 thriller , but this giant basking shark is in fact harmless these toothless gentle giants are one of three shark species to feed only on plankton , the other two being the whale shark and the megamouth shark			1
this fine specimen , while looking imposing , could in fact grow to twice its current size , to an impressive 33ft long			0
while they are protected from being fished under the @entity82 , they can often be caught as by - catch particularly in the warmer months when they swim close to the surface			0
their slow feeding at the surface also means they tend to get killed by speed boats , jet - skis and other fast boats that do n't see them .			0

a 16ft basking shark was pictured circling swimmers in south @entity17
the giant fish was more *interested* in plankton than the *inquisitive* swimmers
