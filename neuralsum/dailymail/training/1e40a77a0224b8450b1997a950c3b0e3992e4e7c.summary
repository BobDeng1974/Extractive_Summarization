by @entity0 published : 06:44 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 10:59 est , 6 august 2013 there are plenty of hazards you are taught to avoid to stay safe while driving a car ... but a woman giving birth in the passenger seat next to you is not one of them			1
this is the exact quandary @entity13 faced as he drove his pregnant wife and two young children to hospital along a motorway in @entity18			1
as @entity20 suddenly began to give birth , @entity19 took his eyes off the road to check she and the baby were ok - only to veer into a ditch and roll the vehicle four times			1
miraculously , not only did he , his wife and their two children survive , so too did their newborn daughter who they found lodged under the front passenger seat , her umbilical cord still attached			2
miracle survival : @entity13 in hospital with wife @entity20 , their eldest two children , one and eight , and the newborn baby ' she told me , " she 's coming out , she 's coming out ! " ' mr @entity13 told @entity18 television on monday			1
' [ then ] i saw my daughter come out and fall headfirst onto the floor of the car			1
' he said @entity20 was in the passenger seat as they rushed to hospital in the eastern city of @entity54 when she went into labour with the couple 's third child			1
the other two , aged one and eight , were on the back seat			0
happy and healthy : the newborn survived the crash after getting lodged under the front passenger seat ordeal : @entity20 , whose facial bruises are still visible , said she was feeling better , but still hurt all over unable to hold the baby in any longer , brave @entity20 was forced to deliver the little girl herself as @entity19 tried to keep a steady hand on the wheel			2
but , worried about his wife and new daughter 's safety , he looked over before crashing the car			2
when the car came to a rest , @entity19 again looked over to find his wife beside him and his first two children conscious in their seats but the baby was nowhere to be seen			2
after a frantic search , he finally found it tucked under the front seat			0
' i fetched her and held her against me , ' he said , adding , unsurprisingly that she was crying			0
an ambulance soon arrived , having been called by a passing motorist and took the family to hospital			0
@entity20 added : ' i feel better			0
but i still hurt all over			0
' @entity90 , however , may have some explaining to do , admitting he was sorry that he totalled the car which he had borrowed from a friend .			0

@entity13 was driving wife @entity20 to hospital in @entity54 , @entity18
but @entity20 could not wait to get to hospital and gave birth in moving car
@entity90 says : ' i saw my daughter come out and fall headfirst onto floor '
he swerved into ditch and rolled the car @entity107 before coming to rest
family was fine but baby nowhere to be seen , until he found her under seat
