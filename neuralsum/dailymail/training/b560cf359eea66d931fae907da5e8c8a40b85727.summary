the @entity1 national team can have few keener admirers than @entity3			1
when he landed the @entity6 job , the 57 - year - old selected @entity8 ’s side as the pinnacle of the style of play to which he would aspire			1
the events of the past month underlined that as a canny choice			0
@entity3 ’s duties as a tv pundit meant he was close to the action in @entity19 as the @entity1 swept all before them to lift a first @entity22 in 24 years			1
pondering : @entity3 will have to work out a way to get points off the @entity1 in qualifying they conceded just four goals in seven matches , with their 7 - 1 semi-final demolition of the hosts going down as one of the most extraordinary of all international results			1
it just so happens , of course , that @entity36 ’s next competitive match comes against @entity6 in the opening @entity38 qualifier on september 7			1
the trip to @entity40 will be the most daunting test yet of @entity3 ’s reign			1
yet , while his respect for @entity8 ’s team is immense , it would be entirely wrong to suggest he is prepared to write off the fixture in any way			0
the national boss is adamant @entity6 will be actively hunting points against the best on the planet			1
nicking a result might just be the difference when it comes to the contest for second place in the group and guaranteed progress to the finals in @entity60			0
big task : they might be world champions but @entity3 thinks @entity6 can get points from @entity36 idols : @entity3 , here promoting tickets for the qualifying games , is a long - term admirer of the world champions ‘ when was the last time @entity36 did n’t qualify for a championship ? it just does n’t happen , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ but these are not free games			0
they are games where we can pick up points			2
‘ over their qualifying campaigns , the @entity1 have dropped points			1
they do n’t win every game but they somehow qualify for every tournament			0
‘ we want to be a team that is picking up something from @entity36 , home and away			1
’ it is not , therefore , just about turning up in the @entity82 in @entity40 and looking for a positive performance			1
‘ no , you always talk about a performance after you get beat , ’ insisted @entity3			2
‘ we want to win			0
it ’s like @entity19 — they just wanted to win			2
’ quality : @entity36 can boast arguably the world 's greatest goalkeeper in @entity91 the @entity1 will play a @entity93 rematch against @entity94 four days before they take on @entity6			1
@entity3 had no intention of accepting a similar friendly as he attempts to get his squad in the best possible shape			2
‘ i wanted the seven days to prepare for @entity36 , ’ he insisted			2
‘ i did n’t want to play a friendly where i ’d be thinking of resting some players and it wouldn ’ t be the team i ’d be playing against @entity36			2
the players would know that themselves			0
‘ then there would have to be a day of rest after the game and suddenly you ’ve only three days to prepare			0
i thought it would be best to get the seven days with the players			0
that will help me over the campaign			0
’ champions : @entity113 lifts the famous gold trophy in @entity19 this will be the third successive @entity117 qualifying campaign — after meetings with @entity119 and @entity120 — in which @entity6 have been grouped alongside the reigning world champions			1
@entity3 feels it is a far tougher path than some nations who made it to @entity19 had to travel			1
‘ i look at some of the teams in the @entity22 and see the sections they ’ve come from , ’ he said			2
‘ if you look at our last draw ( for the @entity22 qualifiers ) , we had @entity133 — who went to about top four in the world but who were pot three when the draw was made			2
‘ then @entity138 , look at their squad and see where those players are playing			0
@entity142 has just moved to @entity143 for £ 20million			0
everyone plays in the @entity145			0
nobody will want @entity138 in any draw now , trust me			0
big fan : @entity3 frequently spoke out about his admiration of the @entity1 while working for @entity150 ‘ and you ’ve got @entity152 who were third in the world at that time			1
that ’s what we had as a qualifying group			0
i do n’t care who you are — if you put those three teams together , you would n’t want to be in that group			0
even @entity36 or @entity161 would n’t want that			2
’ asked if he felt @entity6 would have held their own at the @entity22 , @entity3 replied : ‘ @entity164			1
we are better than teams who were there			0
but they had a different way of getting through			0
’ @entity22 hangover ? @entity6 will be trying to exploit any weakness when the two sides come together			1

@entity3 has long view the @entity1 as the pinnacle of *football*
he worked as a tv pundit while @entity36 lifted the @entity22 in @entity19
but the national boss is adamant @entity6 can take points home and away
a trip to @entity40 represents one of @entity6 's most daunting tests
