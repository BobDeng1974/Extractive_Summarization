by @entity0 @entity1 is warning others not to charge their phones overnight after her @entity5 smartphone caught fire a woman has told of her terror after she woke up to find her phone on fire beside her bed			1
@entity1 , 25 , was asleep when she was woken by a ' sizzling sound ' and the smell of burning			1
she looked down and saw her @entity15 smouldering as it charged on the carpeted floor next to her			1
miss @entity1 grabbed the smartphone and ran to the bathroom and threw it in the sink			1
the civil servant said : ' i woke up at 4.30am when my boyfriend got up to go to work and looked at my phone to check the time			2
' i noticed it was running low on battery so i plugged it in and put it on charge			1
' at about 5am i checked the time again then rolled over and went back to sleep , but within about 10 minutes of that i heard a sizzling sound			1
' even though it was dark i could smell the smoke			2
i picked it up and the screen sparked			0
' as i walked to the bathroom the battery fell out of the casing at the back onto the floor			0
' i did n’t burn myself but there 's a hole in the carpet where it scorched it			1
the smell was awful , so i opened a window			2
' she added : ' i was on my own and panicked because i 'd got no house phone so i did n’t know how to contact anyone to let them know what had happened			2
' in the end , after unplugging everything , i drove to my dad 's house			2
' there are many reasons a phone could burst into flames			2
lots of manufacturers have blamed knock off charger suppliers , who cut corners in their manufacturing			0
however , mostly it has to do with the quality of the capacitor and circuit protector in the inner workings of the phone			2
if these are faulty , failing to either keep the current in the phone to a low voltage , or failing to keep the hot circuits from the plastic phone coating , there can be an exponential increase in heat in the phone			0
this may lead to the capacitor breaking down and sending several hundred volts of electricity into the battery			0
this is often more than the lithium based batteries can take , and they either expand due to the bending and melting of the battery 's shape , or burn up and catch fire , due to the increased heat inside the phone			1
the incident happened at @entity101 's flat in @entity102 , @entity103 around 5.15am last friday morning			1
she said : ' i 've never had anything like this happen to me before			0
it had only been charging for about 50 minutes , if that			0
' i was extremely lucky			0
i 'd warn others not to put their phones on charge while they are sleeping			0
