a chic , vintage - style grey skirt suit ; a sober , high - necked blouse ; a beautifully soft pair of dove - grey suede courts : like the @entity5 , the @entity6 and the @entity7 , @entity4 donned an outfit for yesterday ’s emotional ceremony that seemed both era and occasion - appropriate			1
until you spotted the flying saucer plonked atop her head at the strangest of angles , undoing the elegant understatement below her neck			1
not that the hat itself was at fault : a beautifully finished piece of millinery by society favourite @entity25 ( almost certainly bespoke , but very similar to her @entity27 hat , £ 445 ) , it is made of glossy sinamay expertly stretched on a concave block and finished with a matching bow			0
the problem , then , was in the wearing of it : her long fringe drooped messily over her face , and her hair was loosely pulled back in a chignon - cum - bun affair , covering her ears and jawline and undermining the dramatic lift of the brim			0
with the hat sitting so far forward it dipped low over her eyes , she seemed to be peering out from beneath it like an @entity140			0
there is an art to stylishly donning a hat , one that we seem to have lost			0
‘ in the 1940s , women were used to wearing hats , and suitably - accommodating hairstyles , to finish an outfit , without looking like they were going off to a wedding every day , ’ says @entity146 , milliner to the @entity5			2
smart and chic : @entity65 , who has worked for years in fashion , looked as appropriate as ever in a smart grey suit , which she teamed with a chic dove grey hat arriving : prime minister @entity51 and wife @entity65 arrive at @entity56 on a sunny day @entity52 guests : @entity160 , @entity7 and @entity4 joined each other at the @entity56 graceful style : @entity65 's high - neck collar , trimmed delicately with a ribbon is a nod to ' @entity167 ' fashion inspired by the elegant 19th century lady hand - in - hand : @entity4 locks hands with her husband , whom she is fiercely supportive of , as they arrive for a @entity52 d - day commemoration ceremony meet and greet : @entity73 prime minister @entity173 ( 2nd l ) shakes hands with @entity4 ( r ) , flanked by her husband and @entity177 's prime minister @entity176 ( @entity174 ) prior to a @entity52 d - day commemoration ceremony supportive : prime minister @entity51 and his wife @entity65 hold hands as they walk with @entity177 prime minister @entity176 to @entity56 in @entity91 guests : @entity73 prime minister @entity173 ( @entity174 ) , @entity52 prime minister @entity51 ( c ) and his wife @entity4 ( r ) pose prior to a @entity52 d - day commemoration ceremony at the @entity56 in @entity40 , @entity91 making their way : prime minister @entity51 and his wife @entity65 walk with @entity177 prime minister @entity176 to @entity56 indeed , perhaps it is her own wartime vintage that makes @entity5 such a consummate hat - wearer			1
her outing at yesterday ’s d - day events was no exception : her hat was immaculately matched to the fresh , pea - green colour of her coat			2
@entity160 , too , is fearless in her hat - wearing and yesterday ’s broad - brimmed white number , with its apricot trim , was a perfect match for the custom - made @entity202 coat			2
elsewhere in @entity91 , the @entity6 proved that a retro - style hat could look utterly contemporary , with an upturned disc hat in black straw , with a looped straw ribbon - style decoration			0
husband and wife : prime minister @entity51 and his wife @entity65 put on a united front as they made their way to a service of remembrance for the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings introductions : @entity73 prime minister @entity173 ( @entity174 ) greets @entity52 prime minister @entity51 ( 2nd @entity217 ) and his wife @entity4 ( r ) departure : the couple look sombre as they leave the service marking the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings which saw 156,000 troops from the allied countries join forces to launch an audacious attack on the beaches of @entity91 monumental : veterans and dignitaries gather to hear a service during a @entity52 d - day commemoration ceremony at the @entity56 arrivals : prince @entity235 , @entity235 and @entity160 , @entity7 arrive at @entity56 for a service of @entity237 world leaders : ( @entity239 ) , @entity241 leader @entity240 , @entity52 's deputy pm @entity69 , @entity73 prime minister @entity173 , first minister of wales @entity242 , @entity245 's first minister @entity244 stand in front of the @entity56 paying their respects : ( from l ) @entity73 interior minister @entity173 , @entity52 prime minister @entity51 and his wife @entity4 attend a @entity52 d - day commemoration ceremony remembering : soldiers stand during a joint @entity73 - @entity254 d - day commemoration ceremony in @entity255 , @entity91 today			1

@entity4 's outfit appeared both era and occasion - appropriate
but hat resembled a flying saucer plonked atop her head at strange angle
mrs @entity4 arrived at service hand - in - hand with her husband @entity266
attended @entity268 in @entity73
later attended bi-national @entity73 - @entity52 d - day commemoration ceremony at the @entity74 of @entity75
