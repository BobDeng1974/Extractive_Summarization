to be offered to an institution that promises to offer an education based on @entity3 beliefs campus in @entity5 is ready to be occupied by @entity6 published : 08:13 est , 14 march 2012 updated : 08:39 est , 14 march 2012 a billionaire family from @entity8 is offering a 217 - acre campus for free to a @entity3 institution			1
worth more than $ 20million , the campus in @entity12 , @entity5 will be offered to an institution that promises to offer an education founded on traditional @entity3 beliefs			1
it must also be able to show it has the funds to maintain the sprawling , classic @entity20 campus			2
on offer : a view through a window at @entity24 looks out on to the historic campus , which has been offered to a @entity3 institution the campus was once home to the @entity30 prep school , founded as a girls ’ school by famed evangelist @entity33			1
it now belongs to the @entity36 family , who own the @entity8 - based @entity38 craft store chain			2
they bought in in 2009 for $ 100,000 , with the intention of giving it to a new college named after @entity3 scholar @entity43			1
however that project stalled amid fundraising woes , prompting the @entity46 to search for another owner			0
since the market to resell the campus does not currently exist , @entity38 president @entity36 said the family has decided to offer the campus and its 43 buildings to a select institution that can meet its criteria			1
following $ 5million of renovations , the campus is now ready to be occupied , but it is expensive to keep it in this condition			1
mr @entity36 said the family would like to transfer the grounds to a new owner at least by the end of the year			0
the @entity46 invited 15 top @entity3 institutions to view the campus , 11 of which have now visited			1
another nine have been allowed to inspect the grounds as news of the offer has spread , and more requests are coming in daily			2
some @entity30 alumni are protesting against @entity74 's interest in the campus , citing what they call the ' divisive and hateful ' views of its founder so far , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity74 are among the schools whose names have gone public			2
there is concern about how a conservative @entity3 institution will mesh in a town of about 3,000 in a notably liberal state			1
‘ we hope that whatever 's here can bring people together and not divide , ’ said @entity89 , chair of a town committee monitoring the sale			0
mr @entity36 added that the priority is to find the right tenant , restoring @entity33 ’s original intent to create a place to teach and train people to share @entity102 truth			0
even while the campus remains vacant , @entity33 ’s legacy lives on , with busloads of @entity106 from @entity107 - where @entity33 ’s ministry had a deep impact - still climbing to join hands and pray around @entity33 ’s hilltop grave			2
‘ we would love to see the property be used for a great christian ministry , and if we help somebody to get that started without a lot of heartburn ... and be a light in the area , that would be our primary goal , ’ mr @entity36 said			0
@entity74 's interest has prompted some @entity30 alumni to petition the school 's board of trustees to protest any sale to the university , citing what they called the ‘ divisive and hateful ’ views of its founder , the late rev. @entity130			0
residents have also met to discuss concerns about @entity134 - based @entity74 and the fate of the campus			1
but @entity30 has no say over what the @entity46 decide to do with the property , and @entity74 is not likely a top contender , anyway			0
to make the transaction as simple as possible , the family prefers to give the campus to someone who will take it all , and @entity74 has discussed assuming control of only a portion of it			0
mr @entity36 added such protests would matter ‘ very little ’ to the family if it felt it had found a good suitor who would also be a good neighbour			0
‘ you 'll never please everybody and we understand that , ’ he said .			0
