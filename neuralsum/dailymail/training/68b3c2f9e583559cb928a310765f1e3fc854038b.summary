her father , @entity7 , right , was shot dead in the massacre ' i heard he 'd written the play several years ago , but thought it was too appalling to ever make it to the stage , let alone to the nation 's leading theater district , ' she wrote			1
while she admitted that she admires the playwright 's aim to try to understand the killers ' psychological states , she questioned how much good it was going to do			2
' if @entity22 sought to write a play to raise awareness about @entity50 's pervasive gun violence , he should have started by omitting the killers ' identities , stripping them of the fame and notoriety they so desperately sought - the same notoriety that so many gunmen before and after @entity3 wished to attain , ' she wrote			1
she explained that experts have recommended omitting identities to reduce copycat violence			2
@entity60 : @entity9 , left , and @entity9 , right , shot 13 people at their high school in @entity13 in 1999 missed : @entity8 , a business teacher , was helping students get cover in classrooms when he was shot ' many killers idolized the very boys who killed my father , and used their journals and notes to perpetuate their own plans to victimize and murder others - the same materials that @entity22 used to draft his script , ' she wrote			1
playwright : @entity22 said he thinks ' this is a conversation the country needs to have ' she added that @entity22 's play will only be accessible to a ' privileged few ' in @entity82 - and therefore will not fulfill its aim of hoping to educate people on gun violence			1

' the common perception of [ the killers ] was largely inaccurate			0
' @entity82 - born @entity22 , who was nine at the time of the shootings , said he understands that victims ' families or friends could find his play distasteful			1
' but i think in a larger context this is a conversation this country really needs to have , ' he said			0
he insisted that the play is n't about making money - and will likely make no profit at all - but he simply wants to educate people			1
' i would hope audience members could come away from this play with a new perspective and a desire to maybe reach out to individuals who are troubled , ' he said			0
on stage : the play will be on for five weeks at @entity24 in @entity82 , starting this weekend @entity7 , a popular business teacher , was shot from behind by one of the gunman as he tried to get students safely into classrooms			1
