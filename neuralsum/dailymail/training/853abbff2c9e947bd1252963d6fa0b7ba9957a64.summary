he already has plans to bring the internet to remote parts of the world , and now @entity6 founder @entity5 has set his sights on bringing it to space too			1
the entrepreneur says he wants to build a second internet in space , which could one day be used to enable any people living in colonies on @entity15 to get online			1
there is currently no name for the ambitious space venture , but it could speed up internet services on @entity20 too			2
@entity5 , ( pictured ) says he wants to build a second internet in space , which could one day be used to enable people living on @entity15 to get online mr @entity5 told @entity25 ’s @entity24 , that his aim is to create ‘ a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date			1
’ earlier this month , he said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on @entity15 , later this year			2
he said : ‘ it will be important for @entity15 to have a global communications network as well			2
i think this needs to be done , and i do n’t see anyone else doing it			0
’ mr @entity5 's project would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles ( 1,207km ) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles ( 35,406 km )			1
a stock image is shown @entity42 : the internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online			1
@entity42 is tipped to spend $ 1 billion ( £ 600 million ) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones			0
@entity42 's @entity52 aims to launch high - altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below			1
the helium - filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft ( 15 metres ) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3g - speed internet to remote regions			1
in april , the company also acquired @entity63 , which is building solar - powered drones to provide similar connectivity			0
@entity66 : @entity67 revealed solar - powered drones , satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm 's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries			1
small satellite manufacturers : @entity76 and @entity78 ’s @entity77 are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record			0
the project could cost $ 10 billion ( £ 7 billion ) and $ 15 billion ( £ 10 billion ) , mr @entity5 revealed in a @entity82 , adding that any revenues would be used to fund a colony on the red planet			0
it would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles ( 1,207km ) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles ( 35,406 km )			0
at the moment , internet data packets travelling from @entity93 to @entity94 , for example , have to pass through numerous routers and different networks , whereas mr @entity5 plans to route packs via space satellites instead			2
this would make services faster and potentially cheaper too			0
the project will be run from @entity6 ’s @entity103 office , whose employees will also work on the firm ’s @entity107 rockets , for example			1
the ultimate goal is provide high - speed internet to the three billion people who have poor or no access to the web			2
it ’s thought it will take at least five years to produce and launch the first generation of satellites and the project could take over 15 years to work how mr @entity5 envisions , the @entity115 reported			0
the race is on to connect remote parts of the world , with both @entity42 and @entity66 also investing in technologies such as balloons and drones			1
earlier this month , mr @entity5 said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on @entity15 , later this year			0
an image of @entity128 's proposed colony on the red planet is pictured			0
he said : ‘ it will be important for @entity15 to have a global communications network as well '			0

plan builds on @entity6 founder 's aim to connect remote parts of the world
@entity138 said a space internet could one day be used to enable any people living on @entity15 to get online - although this is in the far *future*
there 's no name for the project , based at @entity6 's @entity103 office
