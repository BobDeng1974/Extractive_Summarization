by @entity0 published : 00:42 est , 26 february 2013 updated : 03:58 est , 26 february 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 who flipped a coin to decide who would donate the kidney that would save their son @entity6 's life the parents of a seriously ill boy were both so desperate to donate him a kidney they decided which one would save his life by tossing a coin			1
@entity14 , now four , was born with @entity15 , meaning his kidneys were unable to filter fluids properly , and urgently needed a transplant or he may not have lived to 18 months old			1
but when both his father @entity21 , 28 , and mother @entity2 , 25 , from @entity19 , @entity20 , turned out to be a perfect match - neither could agree who would be the one to undergo the operation			1
they decided the only fair solution was to flip a coin to decide			1
@entity1 won after correctly choosing ' heads ' and father and son underwent a successful transplant operation in december 2011			1
' both of us decided that whoever was the match would go for it , ' said @entity2			1
' what we did n't expect was that it would be both of us			0
' we were equally as desperate to save his life as we had been through so much			0
i wanted to save him because i had carried him for nine months and given birth to him			2
' but my husband wanted to be the one to save him as he had given up work in a restaurant to look after him			2
' we argued over it and called my mum who said to flip a coin			2
so that 's what we did and how we decided who would donate			0
' i 'll never forget that day , we were stood outside the @entity57 in @entity20 and the doctors had given us a deadline to decide who would donate			1
' my husband flipped the coin , it was like slow motion , i was thinking ' please @entity64 let it be me '			1
' i was gutted when it was my husband - for us whoever got to donate the kidney was the lucky one as it 's such a special gift to your son			0
happy ending : @entity14 in hospital before the transplant , left , and now after making a full recovery , right ' even though i was n't able to donate this time , we have been told that @entity6 will need a transplant in the future , so at least i know i am a match			1
' the operation was a success and @entity6 - who has two brothers @entity81 , six and three - year - old @entity82 - was well enough to start school last september			0
but his situation had looked much more bleak when he was born with the kidney condition			0
as a baby it made him swell up due to excess water leaking into his body and doctors removed his left kidney removed at just nine months old			0
bleak : doctors has said @entity6 may not live to 18 months old after he was born with a condition affecting his kidneys @entity96 : the kidney condition made @entity6 swell up as baby because water was leaking into his body ' we were told at one point that he would probably die at 18 months old , ' said @entity2			2
' the symptoms he suffered were horrendous			0
he was unable to eat and was on a lot of medication			0
' @entity6 is a lot better now and even though he struggles with his eating , he is much stronger			0
' @entity1 said : ' i was so happy i won because i wanted to help my son			1
@entity2 and i argued about it a lot but we decided the only way to settle it was to flip a coin			1
' as a father , i wanted to be the one to help him			2
i 'm very proud of him and i 'm so grateful we were both a match			0
' success : @entity6 with brothers @entity119 , ( left ) and @entity82 ( right ) has recovered enough to start school last september			0

@entity14 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , desperately needed transplant
both father @entity1 , 28 , and mother @entity2 , 25 , were a perfect match
couple both wanted to undergo operation , so flipped coin to decide
