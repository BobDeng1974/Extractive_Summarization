@entity24 is the brainchild of the @entity49 volunteer group of zoo supporters launched in collaboration with @entity52 in @entity53 with the goal of reviving the local zoo			1
a fashionable tussle : the @entity49 volunteers give the denim toys to the animals , who roar , gnaw and claw at them to create statement pieces designed by lions : the jeans feature a distressed denim look that is totally unique and comes with a built - in story telling the purchaser how they were made as of this week , three pairs of jeans - two created by lions and one by a tiger - will be auctioned to the highest bidders on @entity74 's @entity73			1
