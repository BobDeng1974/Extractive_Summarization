by @entity0 published : 17:05 est , 15 november 2013 updated : 20:53 est , 15 november 2013 @entity1 is certainly enjoying its moment in the spotlight			1
@entity5 profits are up almost 32 per cent year - on - year			1
it has just opened its 500th store in @entity5 and has promised another 50 are on their way			1
what ’s more , its products are being heaped with praise			0
@entity1 ’s @entity14 pud recently beat the best that @entity16 and @entity17 had to offer in blind - taste tests by the @entity19			1
and there ’s huge publicity surrounding its £ 540 luxury christmas hamper — again said to rival @entity16 ’ offering , which costs a rather more eye - watering £ 20,000 — not to mention the 1973 @entity25 ( normal price £ 77 ) that it is selling for £ 29.99			1
no wonder , then , that almost one in three households now visits @entity1 at least once a month , according to research agency @entity30			1
and of those , one in five customers is now middle class or upper middle class — up from one in eight a year ago			0
it ’s a telling sign of how audaciously this @entity37 bargain store has taken on the established supermarkets			2
it ’s been a clever evolution , beginning with @entity1 ’s move into more affluent areas such as @entity43 , in @entity44 , and @entity45 , @entity46			1
it also began selling smarter products , from lobster tails and @entity51 ham to @entity53 chocolates			0
other developments to tempt loyal @entity56 and @entity57 ’s shoppers include its proud proclamation that 45 per cent of its goods are produced in @entity5 by the same people who supply leading brands			1
but group managing director @entity63 puts @entity1 ’s success down to one factor : cost			2
‘ we believe growth is down to one thing — customers demanding true value , ’ he says			0
@entity1 manages to achieve such cost - cutting by stocking virtually all own - branded goods			1
it means they do n’t have to split profits with brand manufacturers			0
and as you can see from these pictures , in a slightly naughty marketing sleight - of - hand , @entity1 ’s own - brand products look astonishingly like brands we all know and love — but at a fraction of the price			1
it ’s a clever trick			0
to further cut costs , they sell far fewer lines than most supermarkets			0
while a large @entity92 store will stock 40,000 lines , @entity1 stocks just 1,350			1
@entity94 from retail analysts @entity96 says : ‘ there might be 20 pasta sauces in @entity92 but at @entity1 they might have two or three			2
' because they buy those few lines in such large quantities , they can negotiate very good prices for buying in bulk			0
’ @entity1 ’s shops also follow a no - frills model and — gasp — you ca n’t pay by credit card			2
@entity1 stands for @entity1 after the two brothers , @entity111 and @entity112 , who established the chain just after @entity114 they expanded the store first set up by their mother in @entity118 , @entity37 , in 1913 , to support the family when her husband , a miner , became ill. the brothers opened 13 more outlets selling goods with basic packaging , stored on pallets			1
@entity111 is now dead but @entity112 , 93 , is the richest person in @entity37 with a net worth of £ 14 billion			0
group annual turnover is £ 50 billion in the 17 countries where it operates — partly thanks to the marketing of their cheeky lookalike products			2
such imitations arouse the curiosity of consumers as to whether they really are similar to the brands they ape			0
but how does @entity1 get away with , for instance , that monkey on the @entity142 which looks very like @entity144 ’s @entity143 ? intellectual property partner @entity145 , of law firm @entity147 , says : ‘ brands are cautious about taking legal action in situations like this			0
the brand would need to prove that the copycat product is deliberately out to confuse the buyer into believing that the similar - looking product is actually connected economically to the original in some way			0
’ so , how do @entity1 ’s lookalikes fare in a taste test ? can they really compete with the best of the brands ?			2

sales for supermarket up 32 per cent year on year and 500th store in @entity5 now open - with another 50 on their way , many in affluent areas
one in three households visit @entity1 at least once a month , research claims
products often praised - with its @entity14 puddings beating @entity16 ' and @entity17 *'s* offerings in blind - taste tests by the @entity19
45 per cent of goods are produced in @entity5 and by same people who supply other leading supermarkets
