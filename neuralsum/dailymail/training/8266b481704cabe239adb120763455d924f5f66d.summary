by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 blamed the crushing defeat against @entity4 on @entity6 ’s gung - ho quest for a glorious winner in @entity8 and admitted it was time to pray for help from @entity11			1
@entity12 scored his first @entity14 goal to cancel out a first - half header by @entity16 but @entity19 ’s @entity18 striker settled the game in the 84th minute and left @entity6 teetering on the brink of an early exit			1
' it is such a cruel level , ' said @entity2			1
' you ca n’t give world class players chances – that ’s one thing – and when you ’re still in the game you need to be more difficult to beat			2
that was the disappointing thing for me			2
it is a big learning curve today			2
it ’s very tough at this moment			0
' we never managed the game well enough when we got the equaliser			2
we ca n’t give chances to @entity16 because he buries them from that position			1
it ’s a really tough moment for everyone in the dressing room but we need to be professional , keep fighting and pray for that score - line to go for us			0
looking at the two games and how we performed , we sort of deserved something out of either one of them if not both of them			0
i do n’t think i ’m standing here saying we were poor in both games and our game - plan was wrong			2
' i just thought when we got the equaliser today we just needed to be a bit more clever , a bit more cute and a bit more difficult to beat			2
maybe we should accept that going for a point might have been the best option			0
but they were weak at the back and they were there for the taking			2
once we got the equaliser we tried to use the initiative to get the second			0
' @entity16 struck first with a header from a wonderful cross by @entity98 in the 39th minute			1
@entity12 equalised from close range after good work by @entity101 on the right and @entity16 grabbed a late winner after @entity2 and his centre - halves failed to cut out a long ball			1
staring into space : @entity2 and @entity107 can only walk back up the field as @entity4 's fans celebrate ouch : @entity2 can only watch on as the @entity4 players celebrate @entity16 's decisive goal late in the game friend or foe : @entity4 's matchwinner and @entity2 's club teammate offers condolences at full time ' they were sloppy goals and we have to take responsibility for that as a team , ' said the @entity6 captain			1
' the first one he ’s peeled off onto the back - post and it ’s a fantastic ball by @entity98			0
' the second one , i ’ve gone to try and get good contact on the ball and i have n’t good enough contact on it and i ’ve been punished for it			0
' it his is third @entity14 finals and @entity2 has felt this pain before , but he did not want to launch a full - scale inquest while @entity6 still have a slight hope of going through			1
@entity11 victories against both @entity139 and @entity4 and a 2 - 0 @entity6 win in their last game 2 - 0 against @entity139 will put @entity143 ’s team through to the next round			1
they will be out if @entity11 and @entity139 draw on friday			0
' i need to park the hurt and see what happens over the next four or five days , ' said @entity2			1
' if we go out in the group stage it will be a very personal low for myself and the team and i am sure everyone will feel very similar			0
' who knows ? @entity11 are a fantastic team and capable of winning both games but we ’re clutching at straws			0
the position we ’re in is the position we did n’t want to be in coming into the tournament , relying on other people 's results			0
it ’s very difficult at the moment			0
grit : the @entity6 skipper slid in on @entity165 as @entity6 started to take a grip on the game happier times : @entity12 equalises for @entity6 and celebrates his first @entity14 with the skipper warm embrace : @entity2 has a word in the @entity6 striker 's ear after the goal that levelled proceedings in @entity8 killer blow : @entity16 stole the show with @entity4 's late winner after the ball skidded off the top of @entity2 's head @entity183 in devastating form ' we ’ll have to wait and see what happens			1
the manager will have to wait and see what happens before deciding what he is going to do against @entity139			0
if there ’s nothing to play for then i do n’t know if he ’ll play a completely different team			0
' @entity16 said he sought out his @entity19 captain after the game and told him to “ keep going ” , that he was ' one of the best ' and should ' forget this game '			1
it just had to be @entity16 , back after knee surgery ; his first game for more than a month			1
' it was no surprise , ' said @entity2			1
' everyone in the dressing room knows @entity16 inside out			1
we know what he 's about			0
he 's had two chances in the game and he 's taken them both really well			2
that just goes to show			0
he has n't played for five weeks and yet he comes back and is still as deadly as ever			0
' as for his own international future , the @entity6 captain added : ' it 's not the moment now			2
' end of the world ? @entity2 makes his way back down the tunnel with his head down after the 2 - 1 loss not again ... : @entity2 looks dejected after watching @entity16 latch onto his flick on to score @entity4 's winner contrasting emotions : @entity4 celebrate while @entity2 looks like he wants the ground to swallow him up			1

@entity16 won the game for @entity4 with just six minutes left
skipper @entity2 admits that @entity6 may have thrown too much forward
@entity19 *midfielder* thought @entity4 were there for the taking
but his touch put @entity16 through on goal to crush @entity235 hopes
@entity2 and @entity6 now place their hopes in an @entity239 *favour*
