standing on the touchline at @entity4 ’s academy in the 1990s , watching her determined son @entity5 begin his career , she knew one day his rewards would come			1
‘ i always said he was going to the @entity9 , ’ @entity0 recalled			0
‘ when we were at @entity4 and i was with the mums , i used to say , “ i will be in my 50s before he becomes famous ”			1
i just knew from when he was little			0
he was lovely growing up , always playing football			0
’ rarely are dreams fulfilled as romantically as in this story			0
from the despair of suffering rejection when he was 15 , to finding work in a beetroot factory called @entity28 on £ 20 per day , @entity22 ’s life ’s ambition to play for @entity4 will be officially realised in the next 48 hours			1
coming back home ! @entity22 is on the verge of completing a £ 4m move to boyhood club @entity4 @entity32 bound : @entity22 ( c ) applauds the crowd after @entity35 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity36 at @entity37 great story : @entity41 host @entity39 tweeted his delight at @entity5 's rise this transfer , a closely - guarded secret as negotiations progressed this week , shows that old - fashioned values and a refusal never to give up will ultimately be rewarded			1
@entity22 could easily have gone the way of thousands of other young hopefuls when @entity4 released him in 1997 , shuffling around the non-league circuit harbouring frustrations over what might have been , but it was n’t only his mother who had faith that the picture would not be bleak			1
@entity58 , one of the most influential coaches at @entity4 ’s academy , remembers a talented goalscorer who was always eager to please , and a resolute teenager who had been raised in working - class @entity63 with stout ethics			1
‘ @entity5 was always a strong lad and had an eye for goal that has stayed with him , ’ said @entity58 , whose late father , @entity65 , scouted @entity22 when he was a schoolboy and urged @entity4 to take a look			1
‘ but he always worked very hard , he wanted to learn and he was determined			2
‘ it ’s never easy to let kids leave , and it was n’t easy to break the news to @entity5			0

he comes from good @entity4 stock			1
early years : @entity22 poses with trophies when playing for @entity83 as an 11 - year - old ‘ the desire to work hard and have dedication should be a pre- requisite — look at @entity89 and @entity90 — but not every footballer has it			2
with @entity92 , they were his biggest qualities and it ’s why we had confidence he would go on to earn a living from the game			2
‘ our paths crossed a few years later , when he was with @entity100 ( in 2009 ) and i was working at @entity102			1
he scored a poacher ’s goal from six yards , they won 2 - 0			2
i gave him a hug afterwards and wished him all the best			0
is n’t it great that it has gone full circle for him ? he will be elated			0

‘ he had an eye for goal			0
all we had to do was tidy his professionalism up a little bit			0
he was blessed with natural ability that not many players are given			0
that is what set him apart from the rest			0
’ @entity117 will get a small cut of the £ 4million fee @entity100 receive after they negotiated a sell - on when he moved to @entity143 , who will in turn benefit after inserting a clause when selling him to @entity100			1
it was on the south coast that @entity22 blossomed , with 106 goals in 207 leagues games			1
the catalyst for this blistering run of form , which took him all the way to the @entity35 squad , was a prod from @entity157 , who questioned his professionalism			2
‘ that really stuck , ’ he recalled before his @entity35 debut against @entity159 last august			1
‘ i was overweight , basically			0
i was n’t looking after my body			0
’ take a bow : @entity22 scored for @entity35 on his international debut against @entity159 his first cap brought a first goal , a towering header from a @entity168 cross , and left his mum and dad , @entity120 , in tears			1
not long after that , a fax arrived at @entity100 from @entity174			2
‘ he is a terrific player and i sent the message on behalf of the club and all @entity177 as he is a @entity178 , ’ @entity174 explained last september			0
‘ he is a @entity63 boy and i was just wishing him well , saying we were all proud of him playing for @entity35			2
i ’ve been a big admirer of @entity5			0
