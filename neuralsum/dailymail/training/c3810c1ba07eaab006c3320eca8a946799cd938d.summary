at half time on @entity2 coverage of the @entity3 from @entity4 , we were shown a small bronze bust of one of the @entity8 's favourite sons , sir @entity6			1
it appeared to capture almost perfectly the benign countenance that seemed to sum up his approach to football and his life			2
although whether he would actually be looking quite so philosophical after losing at home to his deadly rivals , @entity17 , is likely another matter entirely			0
the reason we were being shown his statue was because that evening the channel premiered a new documentary that let us into the @entity14 of one our greatest managers , ' once more for @entity6 '			1
the statue of sir @entity6 outside @entity26 captures perfectly his approach to life it did this whilst also recounting the dogged two - wheeled journey undertaken by one of his former players , @entity31 , to honour sir @entity34 and raise money for other cancer charities			1
along with his friend , triathlete @entity38 , @entity31 set out on a 3,500 mile bike ride that took in the clubs sir @entity6 managed across @entity42 and mainland @entity43			1
and it was a journey that also worked perfectly as a metaphor for the years of endurance and triumph sir @entity6 put into both his work and also his very survival			1
sir @entity6 is greeted by @entity50 , and applauded by the @entity26 ' faithful , soon before his death because for @entity31 and @entity38 , across their 25 day vigil , there was plenty of flogging uphill , cruising down hill and lots of rocky roads along the way			1
in terms of the ride itself , it quickly became clear that this was never going to be a walk in the park , as it were			0
perfectly illustrated one day in @entity68 when they encountered the freakish annual phenomenon of the ' black wind '			0
to wax lyrical once again , the boys may have been pulling up trees for their cause , but so was the mistral that swiped across the countryside through which they rode			0
as @entity80 put it , ' we could have pushed the bikes faster '			0
@entity6 referred to his successful period as @entity42 manager as ' national service ' @entity80 , too , had his own personal issues and at one point had gone four days without being able to keep down food or water			1
he eventually found a doctor who was prepared to put down his pizza long enough to pump the former @entity4 defender with as many ivs as he could find lying around his surgery			0
in spite of rough conditions and ill health , the two still managed to complete their journey			0
and some of the most engaging images were seen during the final leg , on their return to home soil			2
all of which climaxed with an emotional appearance at @entity107 , where earlier in the documentary we had also seen sir @entity6 being greeted by a packed house of @entity4 and two teams of retired stars , just five days before he died			1
narrated by actor and arch fan @entity115 , ' @entity116 ' is n't just a road movie , though			0
it also contains interviews with men who had first hand knowledge of sir @entity6			1
and all of them could n't have been more grateful for that fact			0
the best moments from the show are insights into the manager 's relationships , including with wife @entity129 @entity130 said ' he was like a second dad to us '			2
at @entity135 , former @entity134 player @entity133 spoke strongly of his ' values '			0
@entity137 explained how as a seventeen year old , sir @entity6 invited him to meet him the following morning , after a chance encounter , so that he could go to training with him			1
both @entity50 and @entity140 suggested they owed their playing careers to him			0
his surgeon @entity143 observed ' short of chaining him to a bed ' he could n't have stopped sir @entity145 working during his horrible illnesses because he had ' so much drive '			2
journalist and patron of the @entity150 spoke of his incredible success as an @entity42 manager abroad : ' how many ( achieved ) at the level he did ? well , none '			0
@entity130 cries during a memorial service for the manager who had such an impact on those he met but the most important words came from @entity6 himself , taken from his autobiography and spoken by actor @entity162			1
they provided lovely little insights into such things as his life with his beloved wife @entity129 , his relationships with various players and clubs and colleagues ( ' ( @entity167 ) was under my wing for six years - he was exceptionally loyal and watched my back ' ) , his ' eight seasons of national service ' as @entity42 manager , and how , on being asked to manager @entity4 , ' the @entity178 was calling me back			2
i was on my way home '			0
not that the film always hits the target			2
perhaps because of logistical or financial restraints , we did n't have the opportunity to see @entity31 , in particular , interact with any of the contributors , or indeed fans at the various locations along the way , something that would have given the documentary a warmer , more personal touch and not make it feel quite so compartmentalized			1
five years after his death , the new documentary is a fiiting tribute to one of football 's greatest men at times , too , there was just too much cycling to music , and not enough interaction between the friends			2
but really , their effort , coupled with both the cause and the story behind it is enough to make this a most engaging piece of television indeed			1
and five years on from his passing , it provides a timely reminder that this most affable and down - to - earth of football men really did know , and love , his business .			0

' @entity220 of sir @entity6
film features *ex-player* @entity31 cycling around @entity6 's old clubs
while not perfect , this was a most engaging piece of television
