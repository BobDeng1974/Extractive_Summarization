one of @entity1 ' newest cardinals has sparked outrage by claiming that homosexuality is a ' physical defect ' that can be ' cured with the proper treatment '			1
recently elected @entity6 from @entity7 , 85 , who takes up his office in the @entity9 in february , angered gay rights groups by likening the sexual orientation to long lasting physical aliments like his own high blood pressure			1
the comments are in direct contrast to @entity1 ' recent assertion that the @entity17 should not marginalise gay people , but should instead treat them with acceptance and compassion ; comments that were immediately attacked by local politicians			1
cardinal - elect @entity23 , whose outspoken views on homosexuality have been lambasted by the @entity27 as ' medieval ' and ' out of touch ' in an interview with @entity31 , the newly elected cardinal , who lives in @entity34 in @entity35 remained defiant against comments from @entity38 groups that his words were ' medieval ' and ' out of place in this time '			1
@entity6 , the only spaniard among the 19 new cardinals , insisted the @entity1 's message about gay people had been manipulated			1
he said : ' all he is doing is offering comprehension and compassion and showing a desire to welcome those who have gone astray			2
' ' @entity49 is a defective manner of expressing sexuality , because this has a structure and a purpose , which is procreation			0
' a homosexual who ca n't achieve procreation is failing			0
our bodies have many defects			2
i have high blood pressure , a defect i have to try and correct in whatever way i can			1
' to say that homosexuality is a defect is not an insult : it helps because in many cases of homosexuality it is possible to recover and become normal with the right treatment			0
' pope @entity1 giving his first @entity71 from the window of his private residence on march 17 of last year			2
the @entity1 has gained popularity with his recent positivity towards homosexuality pope @entity1 smiles as he points at a rainbow which could be seen over the court of the @entity80 parish of the @entity81 during a pastoral visit a view of a statue and rainbow , adopted long ago as the symbol and flag of homosexuality , as seen from the court of the @entity80 parish of the @entity81 during the @entity1 's visit in an interview about the regeneration people have claimed @entity1 is bringing to the @entity17 , @entity1 said : ' if a person is gay and seeks @entity94 who am i to judge ? ' the @entity1 's recent messages on accepting and giving compassion towards homosexuals in the @entity17 earned him the award ' 2013 person of the year in ' @entity101 ' , a @entity103 gay and lesbian magazine			1
when reminded of the @entity1 's speech last year asking for compassion towards homosexuals , he said : ' the pope is very respectful and holds all people in high esteem but he does n't betray or change the traditional teaching of the church			1
it is one thing to be compassionate towards homosexuals , and another thing to morally justify the practice of that homosexuality			0
' you can tell a person what their weakness is but that does n't justify a decision to respect them and help them			0
' people with rainbow flags chant slogans as they attend @entity129 2007 in @entity130 , @entity131 the 84 - year archbishop emeritus of @entity133 , one of 19 new cardinals named by @entity1 last week , elevated archbishop to the rank of cardinal in recognition of his life - long service to the church			2
however , he is not among the 16 cardinals who were given voting rights and will one day elect his successor			0
@entity145 , spokesman for the left - wing @entity147 party in @entity34 , spoke out against @entity6 's anti-gay sentiments			0
he said : ' these are not the winds of change that appear to be blowing from the @entity152			0
' @entity1 seemed to have distanced himself from these retrograde , insulting and anti constitutional theses			2
' he should be asking himself whether a cardinal like this is helping the regeneration he defends			0

likened homosexuality to human defects like his own high blood pressure
comments were directly opposing @entity1 's recent views on homosexuality
@entity38 *community* calls @entity168 's comments ' medieval ' and ' out of touch '
@entity168 claimed @entity1 's message of compassion had been ' manipulated '
