a mission to @entity1 is something that many have been hoping for ever since the last explorers left the surface of the moon			2
and now @entity7 has stated that they intend to land humans on the red planet in 2035			1
chief scientist dr @entity13 , in a series of talks across the @entity12 , outlined the plans of the agency to undertake such a mission in the next two decades			1
to get there she says there are a number of technological milestones that must be reached , including sending astronauts to an asteroid , to ensure the crew 's survival @entity7 ’s developments in recent years have revolved around ultimately sending people to @entity1			1
these include the creation of the @entity36 heavy - lift rocket and the @entity38 capsule			0
both will be components of any future attempt to land humans on the surface of @entity1 before returning to @entity44			2
‘ to unambiguously settle the questions of whether there was life on @entity1 it will take scientists down on the surface , ’ dr @entity13 said at the @entity45 in @entity46			1
she added that getting humans to @entity1 is @entity7 ’s ‘ primary mission ’ but there is a long way to go before all the technologies are ready – although she did say 2035 was ultimately the target			1
prior to the @entity1 attempt will be a mission to move an asteroid into position between the moon and @entity44 that will later be visited by astronauts			2
this is seen as a vital stepping stone for testing the technologies that will eventually make a @entity1 mission possible			0
@entity7 's @entity38 capsule will be one of the key components of any future attempt to land on @entity1			1
the capsule will be responsible for launching astronauts into space and ultimately returning them to @entity44			0
it is pictured here at the @entity77 at @entity7 's @entity78			1
its first flight will occur in december and , in a separate talk at the @entity82 in @entity46 according to the @entity83 , dr @entity13 said @entity1 ‘ remains our primary focus ’ in the near term			1
but , she says , it is not an undertaking @entity7 plans to attempt alone – it will require cooperation on an international scale with other nations			2
dr @entity13 also adds that the first mission , which would be a return trip of about three years , will be a precursor to humanity ultimately settling and colonising the surface of @entity1			1
‘ i do n't think that first group will necessarily stay there , but we need to think of this as establishing an outpost , ’ she said			0
‘ we want it to be possible for those people to come back if they want to , but it 's the beginning of sustained human presence on @entity1			2
’ dr @entity13 , however , as keen to stress the importance of being cautious when undertaking what would arguably be makind ’s greatest accomplishment			1
other organisations such as the privately funded @entity109 have claimed they will land humans on @entity1 by 2025 , but have yet to reveal much research and development that indicates such a goal is achievable			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , is taking the careful approach			0
‘ we want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of @entity1 , ’ dr @entity13 said according to the @entity115			1
‘ for us , that is a non-negotiable position			0
there is a lot of work to do , that ’s why we need all of the space agencies around the world working together			0
’ @entity7 would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide			2
they would then tow or push it towards @entity44 so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon			0
in 2021 astronauts would then use an @entity38 - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis			0
this asteroid would also , probably in the 2030s , be used as a stop - off point for astronauts on their way to @entity1			1
exact details on how @entity7 plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known , but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag			1
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation @entity38			0
after the @entity38 and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object			0
once the @entity38 docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows			0
after the mission is complete , @entity38 returns to @entity44 on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean – likely the @entity172 – 10 days later , as seen in the video .			0

@entity7 's chief scientist dr @entity13 has outlined their plans for @entity1
in a series of talks across the @entity12 she says we *'ll* be there by the 2030s
but she *explains* there are key developments that must be made first
these include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components
this will ensure the first @entity1 - walkers survive a return trip to the red planet
