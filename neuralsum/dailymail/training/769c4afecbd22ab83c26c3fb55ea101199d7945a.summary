it was @entity2 's manager who said that in @entity4 , ' you 've got to knock them out to get a draw '			1
almost 60 years since @entity8 was controversially disqualified in @entity9 , @entity7 became the latest @entity10 to fall foul of scandalous judging			1
the @entity14 super-middleweight pushed world champion @entity15 to the brink in @entity17 only to be left ' disgusted ' by the scorecards			1
@entity7 was left distraught after scandalous judging robbed him of the fight in @entity4 @entity7 and world champion @entity15 ( r ) appeared to be closely contested judges voted unanimously in favour of @entity15 in another controversial decision from @entity4 @entity7 is consoled by former world champion @entity24 after the fight after a nip and tuck fight that swung first to the champion and then to the challenger , the result appeared to be on a knife edge			1
but the ringside judges disagreed with two awarding @entity15 the fight by six rounds while the other , disgracefully , gave @entity7 just one of the sessions			1
visibly distraught , the 31 - year - old said : ' what can you do ? it 's disgusting			2
it 's the main thing i hate about boxing			2
most of them [ the judges ] have never fought and they 're robbing kids of life - changing opportunities			2
' i proved i 'm not @entity51 level			2
i did some things wrong but i did a lot of it right			0
i was outworking him every round			0
i was shading a lot of the rounds			0
it 's @entity4 , i well and truly got my fingers burnt			1
@entity7 and @entity15 trade blows during the fight in @entity17 , @entity4 @entity7 requested a rematch after the fight as promoter @entity65 also complained about the verdict @entity15 is likely to chase a lucrative domestic fight against the winner from @entity69 or @entity70 ' i believe i did enough			1
at the end of the rounds i did n't think i was losing many of them			0
' @entity7 's promoter @entity75 echoed his fighter 's frustrations			2
he said : ' the sickening thing is the scores			0
these people ca n't be judging fights ; they are not good enough			2
i ca n't help but laugh , how can you score that fight 11 - 1 ? ' the score cards go down in history but they wo n't reflect the fight			0
@entity7 has worked all his life for this opportunity and just wanted a fair crack at the whip			2
' @entity7 demanded an immediate rematch but that looks unlikely as @entity15 chases a money - spinning domestic dust - up against old foe @entity69 or @entity96 who meet in november			1
ironically , the latter is no stranger to claims of robbery from @entity51 fighters			0
both @entity102 and @entity103 challenged the former middleweight world champion in 2011 but left empty handed after a split - decision loss and a draw respectively			1
@entity7 walks away ' disgusted ' after the match was awarded to the home favourite @entity7 has the dignity to congratulate his opponent after the @entity112 title fight @entity15 admitted : ' of course i would fight @entity7 again			1
i 'm sure it would be another exciting fight			0
however the circumstances would need to be right			0
at the moment the most interesting fight for me would be @entity96 or @entity69			1
' @entity7 , who remains the @entity51 champion , was philosophical on the morning after the night before			1
he tweeted : ' listen i 'm alive , i 'm healthy and i 've got an amazing family			0
life 's a bigger game than boxing			0
i 've always said that			0
i 'll be back ! '			0

@entity7 was *defeated* by world champion @entity15 in @entity4
@entity128 super middleweight left feeling ' disgusted ' by scandalous judging
@entity7 immediately asked for a rematch , but @entity15 is more likely to face the winner between @entity69 or @entity96
