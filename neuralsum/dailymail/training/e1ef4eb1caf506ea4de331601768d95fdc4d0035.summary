' doctors placed an inflatable silicone shell under the skin of her forehead and gradually filled it with fluid in order to expand her skin and provide them with extra tissue for her new nose			0

doctors put a silicone shell under skin in her forehead to expand tissue that was then used to build her new nose terrifying : @entity10 's nose and ears were sliced off by her abusive husband as she tried to escape their home at ease : @entity10 is pictured with her mother figure @entity77 - @entity76 their next step is to take cartilage from @entity10 's rib underneath her breast , which will be used to build her nose			1
the skin from her forehead will then be ' flapped down ' to cover the structure			0
@entity10 ’s story was first told in august 2010 by @entity87 , who published a harrowing cover photo of her - horrifying people around the world and symbolising the oppression of @entity2 women			1
when she was 12 , her father promised her in marriage to a @entity97 fighter to pay a debt			2

famous photo : @entity10 's story was first told in 2010 by @entity87 , who published this harrowing cover photo of her - horrifying people around the world and symbolising the oppression of @entity2 women she managed to get to a @entity11 medical facility , where medics cared for her for 10 weeks , and then was taken to a secret shelter in @entity115 before she was flown to the @entity11 by a charity to stay with a family			1

recovery : @entity135 ( pictured with a prosthetic nose in @entity137 , @entity122 , in october 2010 ) moved to the @entity11 after fleeing @entity2 but @entity10 will look far worse before she stars to look better , and her forehand already has major swelling , while darkened and drooping flesh is currently where her nose once was , reported @entity34			1
she was given a prosthetic nose at first , but full plastic surgery had to be delayed because it was thought she was still not emotionally stable to cope with the painful and lengthy surgery required			0
@entity10 was said to have displayed volatile mood swings in the past - oscillating between violent tantrums and displaying deep affection to people around her - so the surgery is a huge milestone			2
