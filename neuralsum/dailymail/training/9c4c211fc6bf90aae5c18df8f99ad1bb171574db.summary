@entity0 admits the big clubs must be crazy if they ’re not considering a swoop for his @entity4 strike partner @entity3			1
@entity5 has 12 goals in 16 games in his first @entity9 campaign and , with the transfer window about to open , @entity4 are desperately trying to extend his contract - aware that his goals could be the difference between survival and relegation			1
‘ as a club , we need to tie him down and get him a new deal , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ without a doubt other clubs will be looking at him and if they ’re not they ’re crazy because he can get you that goal			0
@entity0 appeals for time - wasting from @entity26 goalkeeper @entity25 @entity3 celebrates scoring a second - half penalty for @entity4 at @entity26 on @entity28 friday @entity3 ( centre ) tries to dribble past @entity30 ( left ) , as @entity4 fell to a ninth straight @entity9 win ‘ he did well for us last year and even though it ’s been a step up we know what he can do			1
' he was n’t scoring wonder - goals , going past four or five people ; they ’re striker ’s goals , finisher ’s goals and if you ’ve got that ability , you can do it at any level			2
’ like @entity3 , @entity0 took the scenic route from @entity45 to the top flight			1
‘ it ’s a great route and a great story , ’ added the 33 - year - old			1
‘ it gives you extra hunger			0
it ’s brilliant and i ’m pleased for him			0
’ @entity3 scored a hat - trick as @entity4 beat @entity57 3 - 2 in their last @entity9 home game @entity3 pictured playing for former club @entity59 in @entity60 during the 2008 - 09 season all but two of @entity3 ’s goals this season have come at @entity65 , where @entity4 return to take on @entity66 today			1
without a point in nine away games , it will be vital for @entity71 ’s team to continue winning at home			0
‘ maybe it ’s a psychological problem for everyone that comes to our place , ’ said @entity0 , reversing the idea of a mental block			2
managerless @entity66 will have to be wary of @entity4 's in - form striker @entity3 on sunday ‘ we ’ve got a good record and it ’s not a nice place to come really is it , in terms of the changing rooms and how close the crowd are			1
‘ we know it will change away from home at some stage			0
’ sunday 's game against @entity66 is another crucial fixture for both teams and @entity71 ’s team selection on @entity28 for the 2 - 1 defeat at @entity26 had this game in mind			2
‘ one or two ca n’t play two in three days , ’ said the @entity4 boss , citing @entity0 , who came on as a substitute at the @entity101 , and his 30 - something defenders @entity102 and @entity104 , who should return			1
@entity106 , skipper for the game at @entity26 , applauds the travelling support after the 2 - 1 defeat @entity71 ( right ) issues instructions to @entity4 striker @entity111 during the game at the @entity101 @entity113 did not play at @entity26 because he was on four bookings and could not risk missing the @entity66 game through suspension , and @entity71 gave @entity117 ‘ half a chance ’ of being fit after a slight hamstring problem			1
‘ every time i ’ve seen @entity66 this year i ’ve been impressed , ’ said @entity71			0
‘ they ’ve got pace , they play with wingers and they ’re a dangerous side			0
