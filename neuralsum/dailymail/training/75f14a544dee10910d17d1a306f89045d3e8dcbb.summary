drugs cheats in athletics are running out of ways to escape their fate , according to a leading anti-doping authority			0
@entity5 from the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) says that new innovations in technology means cheats who beat the system now will be caught in the future - with no place to hide after samples are retested			1
the use of archived samples has already seen 15 athletes retrospectively charged - and @entity5 believes that the new prospect of being caught in future should help stop athletes doping now			1
speaking out : @entity5 hopes that the changes in drug testing will help stop athletics cheats talking it through : having spent years on fighting drugs , four - time olympian @entity5 has seen a lot and with competitors facing longer bans as the new four - year penalty for doping offences comes into effect in january - those who try to gain an unfair advantage need to watch their backs			1
' the retesting is a really important innovation ; the @entity6 has been maintaining – that is retaining – samples since 2005 , so we have samples from all of the medallists from our major events since 2005 , ' @entity5 said			2
and with reanalysis soon to be allowed up to 10 years ( from eight ) - there are more opportunities to stop cheats			0
something to get sorted : drugs in athletics are still a big problem but the changes could put off potential cheats innovation : @entity5 spoke about the retesting of samples that will stop today 's cheats in years to come ' the purpose of this is as testing science improves we are going back to samples that originally tested negative but now we have new methodology and we ’re getting positive test results so this is absolutely critical , she added			2
' i think it ’s sending a very strong message to any athlete who is tempted to dope that the fact that you might not get caught today is not going to provide you with assurance about something that may happen in the next decade and given the rate of scientific progress i ’d be thinking twice myself about doing something if i thought sometime in the next 10 years my sample might be retested			0
' the only route out for cheats is admission - as in the case of @entity80 , which saw the sprinter have his sentence reduced in a trade - off for information			2
@entity80 ended up with a one year ban			0
returning : @entity80 only suffered from a one year drugs ban due to his willingness to provide information plea : @entity5 and the @entity6 are hoping that the changes in the way tests are handled will stop doping ' it sticks in my craw that @entity80 only gets the one - year penalty , ' @entity5 said			1
' there ’s a trade - off : if we want to get information and intelligence that will help us better manage and curtail doping , then we ’re going to have to bite our tongue , hold our nose , and a guy like @entity80 is going to get a penalty that is going to be reduced to one year			1
' under the new code he might not get a penalty all the way back to a single year			0
' changing times : if gay was caught next year under the new rules he might not get off as lightly			0

@entity5 says innovations in the *industry* are making it *impossible* for cheats to escape - whether that happens now or in the future
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) are keeping back old samples to test with new technology
so far 15 athletes have lost out after their samples were later tested
science - in particular *biological* *profiling* - is *evolving* fast and making a *difference* as *detection* completely changes
january 2015 will see new four - year penalty for doping offences come in
@entity5 wants to see the likes of @entity80 get longer sentences even in a trade - off for information about doping
