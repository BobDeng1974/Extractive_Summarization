@entity1 football has certainly had better days			0
still coming to terms with the morning resignation of their most gifted and charismatic coach , @entity5 , the @entity2 then saw its champions humbled , embarrassed even , at a feverish @entity7 do @entity8 on wednesday night			2
not since the days of @entity10 more than a decade ago have @entity9 seen anything quite like this			2
@entity9 remain one of @entity14 ’s eminent teams – they have been champions in three of the last four seasons – and won the @entity17 four years ago			2
but nothing quite feels the same as bringing a genuine @entity21 superpower to its knees and @entity9 and their rapturous supporters went home knowing that they now have a more than a decent chance of squeezing through to the semi-finals of the @entity27 when the teams reconvene in @entity29 next tuesday			1
@entity9 earned an impressive 3 - 1 @entity27 first leg victory against @entity2 champions @entity31 on wednesday night @entity31 goalkeeper @entity32 brings down @entity9 striker @entity33 to concede a third minute penalty the @entity31 players surround referee @entity36 following his decision to award @entity9 a spot - kick the 31 - year - old forward had no problem slotting the ball past @entity32 to give his side an early 1 - 0 advantage @entity1 star @entity32 dives in the wrong direction as @entity45 calmly slots away the spot - kick with just three minutes on the clock @entity9 : @entity48 6.5 , @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 7 , @entity51 7 , @entity52 7 , @entity53 7 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 7 ( @entity56 74 ' 6 ) , @entity45 8.5 ( @entity57 ' ) , @entity33 8 , @entity58 7 ( @entity59 ' ) subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity52 , @entity54 , @entity49 goal : @entity66 ' ( p ) & 10 ' , @entity68 ' manager : @entity70 8.5 @entity31 : @entity32 6 , @entity71 6 , @entity72 5 , @entity73 5 , @entity74 5.5 , @entity75 6 , @entity76 5 ( @entity77 73 ' 6 ) , @entity78 6 , @entity79 6 , @entity80 5.5 , @entity81 6 ( @entity82 56 ' 5.5 ) subs not used : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 booked : @entity32 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity82 goal : @entity78 28 ' manager : @entity91 6 @entity92 : @entity45 referee : @entity36 6 ( @entity94 ) att : 50 , 092 @entity31 , it must be said , were wretched			1
missing key players , @entity97 ’s team were also missing balance , cohesion and an ability to defend properly			0
only the cruel would say that in a week when all the talk has been about @entity97 moving to @entity103 in a year ’s time , he oversaw a performance rather familiar to those who have been watching the fallen @entity108 champions recently			0
@entity97 ’s team started badly and got worse			0
in the middle of the game they improved a little but as the second half wore on they failed themselves once again			0
this was a defeat by two goals that they can have no complaints about at all			0
if they do n’t improve markedly next week then they really will go out			0
beforehand , there was little to suggest this would happen			0
yes , @entity31 were without @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 but @entity9 are a team with little recent @entity27 pedigree			1
as kick - off approached you could find odds as long as 4 - 1 on a home win			1
a couple of minutes in to the game , however , the ground shifted significantly beneath @entity31 ’s feet and it was , it must be said , entirely their own fault			2
no doubt expecting a bright start from @entity9 , @entity31 simply had to ride it out			1
after all , it happens to them wherever they go			0
they are used to it			0
here , though , calamity befell the @entity1 immediately			0
@entity76 dithered under pressure from @entity33 on the edge of the penalty area and when the @entity147 referee deemed the @entity9 forward ’s challenge legal the @entity150 eased clear and was felled by goalkeeper @entity32			1
the @entity1 number one could have been sent off but was n’t			0
he received only a yellow card			0
@entity9 playmaker @entity45 , meanwhile , moved forwards to put the penalty to @entity32 ’s right			1
an awful start for @entity31 and perfect for @entity9 , the pattern continued and in the tenth minute the visiting team contributed another absolute horror show			1
this time it was the @entity162 central defender @entity73 who erred , giving the ball away to @entity45 40 yards from goal , allowing his opponent to race away and score comfortably with the outside of his right foot as @entity32 advanced			1
the former @entity169 attacker wheels away in celebration after scoring his first goal of the game at the @entity7 do @entity8 @entity45 is congratulated by @entity175 's latest signing @entity49 ( 2 ) as @entity9 celebrate taking the lead the @entity14 forward pounced on a defensive mistake by @entity73 ( right ) before slotting @entity9 into a 2 - 0 lead @entity9 's route one second goal saw @entity45 make the most of @entity48 's long punt up field - click here to see more from our @entity185 the @entity9 fans react with joy as @entity66 sprints towards them in celebration of his quick - fire double there were many people here who perhaps could n’t believe what they were seeing			1
on the touchline @entity97 would have been one of them but , outwardly at least , he appeared calm			0
@entity80 had already shaved the bar with a header between the two @entity9 goals and perhaps he was confident that his team would improve sufficiently to save themselves			2
certainly the game ’s third goal was always going to be important and it was @entity31 who scored it			2
as the first half had worn on they had begun to impose themselves a little and it was therefore no great shock when @entity72 ’s low cross from the right was driven in by @entity78 from close range at the far post in the 28th minute			1
with an hour of the game – and two and a half hours of the tie – remaining , @entity97 perhaps felt that things were now under some semblance of control			2
as it turned out , he was wrong			0
@entity31 started the second period almost as badly as they had started the first and would have slipped two behind once more had @entity32 not produced the save of the night , acrobatically turning over @entity53 ’s close range shot			1
@entity32 looks exasperated as the @entity2 champions concede their second goal of the game with just 10 minutes gone @entity31 boss @entity97 looks perplexed as his side fall two goals behind during the early stages of the @entity27 clash @entity78 pulled his side back into the game after a prolonged spell of pressure paid off for @entity97 's side the @entity147 maestro grabbed the ball and headed straight back to the halfway line as @entity31 searched for an equaliser @entity9 's head coach @entity70 ( left ) shouts instructions to his team during the @entity27 first - leg it was a save that few goalkeepers in @entity242 perhaps would have made but still @entity31 ’s problems would n’t go away			1
@entity9 were too quick and too hungry for them in the middle of the field and the @entity1 simply could n’t keep hold of the ball long enough to impose themselves on what should have been inferior opposition			2
throughout the whole of the second half , @entity31 hardly created an opportunity and when what could yet be the decisive third @entity9 goal arrived with 25 minutes left it represented another act of self - harming from the visitors			1
the long ball down the inside left channel really should n’t have caused @entity31 any problems but @entity72 for some reason chose not to head it clear and @entity33 then displayed a terrific turn of speed to round @entity32 – who left his line as slight favourite - and score from a tight angle			1
@entity31 still had time but they had not the wit to get back in to the game			2
they will have to do their work at the @entity275 in five days ’ time			0
this was @entity9 ’s night and if @entity14 football has something of an inferiority complex these days – and it really has – then evenings like this will go some way to helping			0
@entity9 's @entity52 ( centre ) looks to get the better of @entity147 midfielder @entity76 during the @entity21 encounter @entity150 striker @entity33 rounds @entity32 with ease before slotting into an empty net and putting @entity9 3 - 1 ahead @entity32 was unable to stop @entity33 as the @entity150 made the most of a mistake from @entity31 defender @entity72 @entity33 celebrates putting @entity9 into a commanding 3 - 1 lead as @entity31 have a night to forget in @entity14 @entity33 ( left ) celebrates his goal in front of the @entity9 faithful as @entity76 and @entity32 look shell - shocked @entity73 ( left ) leaves the @entity7 do @entity8 pitch with his team - mates as @entity31 suffer a shock 3 - 1 defeat @entity31 captain @entity75 reacts after his side lose only their second @entity27 match of the 2014 - 15 campaign			1

@entity9 earn 3 - 1 @entity27 *quarter* - final first leg victory against @entity31
@entity45 gives @entity9 early lead with third minute penalty after @entity32 's foul on @entity33
former @entity169 man @entity45 doubles home side 's lead following mistake from @entity31 defender @entity73
@entity78 pulls @entity2 champions back into the tie with 28th minute strike
@entity150 forward @entity33 puts @entity9 into commanding 3 - 1 lead midway through second half
