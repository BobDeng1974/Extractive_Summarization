it was a foul - mouthed rant from former prime minister @entity1 that no one was meant to see			1
but his f - bomb laden tirade went viral in 2012 when someone stole footage of him losing it as he bungled lines for a recorded video message and uploaded it online			2
now three years on , it has been revealed @entity11 spent 476 hours trying to narrow down suspects but they are still no closer to finding the culprit , ninemsn reports			1
the video was shot and edited in september 2009 by an assistant adviser in mr @entity1 's media team - @entity32 - as the former pm was recording a message in @entity35 congratulating @entity36 on the 60th anniversary of the @entity38			1
it was recorded on a digital video cassette and was stored in the prime minister 's office after the video was digitally edited and all files had been deleted from computers			0

@entity54 was shot in september 2009 by an assistant adviser in mr @entity1 's media team as the former @entity33 recorded a message in @entity35 congratulating @entity36 on the 60th anniversary of the @entity38 footage was leaked when it was uploaded to @entity47 by a user known as @entity49 in february 2012 despite an extensive investigation , @entity11 have still not worked out who leaked the video they found the footage could have only come from the cassette tape , but more than 100 people would have had access to it			1
@entity23 documents showed police came to the conclusion the tape had been lost when mr @entity1 's files were removed after @entity74 successfully overthrew him for the top job in 2010			2
attempts by police to locate the @entity47 account holder also failed			0
authorities could have tracked the account holder by gaining access to the geographic location in the computer 's ip address , but @entity85 - the owner of @entity47 - refused the police request			0
documents obtained by ninemsn under the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) @entity22 showed police interviewed 17 people and took statutory declarations from 27 others following the video leak the ip address may have led police to a home address , or a public computer where they could have gone through @entity100 footage to track down the culprit			1
police did not pursue this further as @entity105 authorities ruled they did n't have probable cause to make @entity85 reveal its records			0
if the police had managed to locate the person responsible , they may have faced up to 10 years in jail as it was considered theft from the @entity113 and @entity114 .			0
