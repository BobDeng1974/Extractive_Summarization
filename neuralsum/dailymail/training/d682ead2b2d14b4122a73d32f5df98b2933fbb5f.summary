by @entity1 reporter killer : @entity3 , 28 , who was today found guilty of the murders of a whole family , who all died when a fire he started ripped through their home a violent alcoholic who killed three generations of a family – including his own baby – in a jealous rage was jailed for at least 30 years yesterday			1
@entity3 set fire to a house , trapping his girlfriend @entity17 , her daughter @entity18 and miss @entity17 ’s mother @entity19			1
@entity20 , 28 , started the blaze because he was convinced miss @entity17 , 17 , had another man in her bedroom			1
but the only people in the house were family celebrating six - month - old @entity18 being allowed home from hospital for the first time			0
she was deaf and blind , having been born 13 weeks premature weighing 1lb 9oz			0
her twin , @entity28 , who weighed only 15oz , had died two days after being born			1
@entity20 , who had been banned from the home in @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , after making repeated threats to kill miss @entity17 and the baby , set fire to a recycling bin in the porch			1
the smoke and flames spread quickly and prosecutor @entity40 told @entity41 : ‘ the three victims did n’t have a chance			1
‘ they could n’t get down the stairs because the fire was set deliberately by the front door			1
’ @entity48 saw miss @entity17 banging on the windows and screaming for help but they were beaten back by the flames as they tried in vain to save her , her 46 - year - old mother and the baby			1
@entity20 , who yawned in court as a statement by miss @entity17 ’s family was read out , was jailed for life after being found guilty of three counts of murder			1
judge @entity63 ordered that @entity20 , whom he described as ‘ despicable ’ , should serve a minimum of 30 years , telling him : ‘ there is no saying whether you will ever be released			1
‘ you must have known that once the fire had taken hold that there would be virtually no chance of escape			2
' you condemned @entity19 and @entity17 to an agonising death			1
you have shown no remorse			2
’ tragedy : @entity20 ' girlfriend @entity17 , 17 , died alongside her mother @entity77 ( right ) after their home in @entity32 was set on fire callous : his own daughter @entity81 was only six - months - old when she died after a fire swept through the property @entity20 , who was unemployed and had been living in a tent outside the house , had denied murder			1
he claimed he was in a pub at the time the fire was started in september last year			2
but a series of aggressive and abusive texts @entity20 had sent miss @entity17 the night before , threatening to torch the family home , were read to the jury , and he was seen outside the house displaying ‘ a callous , almost casual disregard ’ as the inferno took hold			1
mr @entity40 said : ‘ neighbours were shocked by how calm he appeared to be			0
he showed no emotion and did not attempt to rescue his daughter or the woman he claimed to love			2
it was the actions of a cold - hearted killer who knew exactly what he was doing			2
‘ he had carried out the threat he had made hours earlier			0
’ calculated : the court heard @entity20 started the fire in the porchway of the three - bed house , blocking the exit horrifying : gwent police pictures show the black , charred inside pf the fire damaged house in @entity31 shortly after the arson attack light pours through where the roof used to be before it was destroyed in the fire that killed the three victims home : the tent @entity20 had lived in in the front garden of the house he torched			2
he had also been banned from seeing his child @entity18 unsupervised @entity20 met miss @entity17 on the internet when she was 15			1
he was living in @entity135 and travelled to @entity32 to meet her			0
he deliberately set out to groom her and their relationship developed into a sexual one			2
but he became obsessively jealous of @entity140 , over whom he seemed to exercise a ‘ magnetic control ’ , the court was told			0
she became pregnant with the twins , born in march last year			0
mr @entity40 said : ‘ @entity17 started acting as a mother			1
@entity20 did n’t want @entity17 to spend more time with the baby			1
he wanted @entity17 to be with him and him alone			1
he become convinced she was having an affair			2
’ this , he said , led to the tragedy			0
shameful : the murderer was motionless in the dock as he was found guilty and sat with his head bowed as the judge jailed him the court heard @entity20 ( left ) started the fire after he became convinced @entity17 ( right ) had another man in her bedroom the court heard the only people in the house were grandmother @entity19 ( left , with granddaughter @entity18 ) , @entity17 and the six - month - old baby , who had just returned from hospital after being born prematurely prosecutor @entity164 said @entity20 became ' obsessively jealous of @entity17 ' after they met on the internet the jury was told that @entity20 would n't leave @entity17 ( pictured ) alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home in a statement to the court , mrs @entity17 ’s mother @entity171 , 64 , said : ‘ the heart has been ripped out of our family by the senseless actions of @entity3			1
there ’s a hole in my life that no one will ever fill			2
‘ i ’m so lost without them and i can not truly express this			0
like her mum , @entity17 always had a smile on her face , she loved her family and we all loved her			1
‘ @entity18 battled so much			0
but the fire that night was a battle too far			2
’ @entity190 and friends burst into applause as @entity20 was taken away to begin his sentence			0
they released three white doves and balloons on the steps of the court in memory of the three victims			0
in a statement afterwards , the family said : ‘ today we feel justice has been served			2
’ underweight , shifty and with a diffident demeanour @entity3 was about as far from appearing intimidating in court as possible			1
his threatening texts promising violence and murder to teenager @entity17 ( together right ) showed him to be a bully and a coward			1
in court he appeared slightly built and pale - faced and above all eager to avoid eye contact with his murder trial jury			0
chronically soft - spoken he mumbled his way through his evidence and was frequently incomprehensible			0
despite electing to stand when he gave evidence @entity20 lent forward and bent his knees in such a way he almost appeared to be sitting			0
as a result his face frequently fell below a small flat screen tv in the witness box , making it difficult for the jury to see him			0
the combination of his stance and almost whispered evidence led his own defence barrister to berate him for failing to speak up			0
' you are on trial for three counts of murder			0
this is your chance to give your story			0
now please buck up , ' @entity236 told him in court			0
in all @entity20 appeared a pathetic and forlorn figure , a stark contrast to the brutish language used in his chilling text messages			0
in many ways , however , he also represents the embodiment of every parent ’s worst nightmare .			0

@entity3 , 28 , was jailed for life at @entity41 today
