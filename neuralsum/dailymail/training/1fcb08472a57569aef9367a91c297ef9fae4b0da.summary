doh ! fire crews had to cut this enormous @entity9 lorry out of @entity5 in @entity6 after it attempted to squeeze through late on thursday its cab managed to clear the arch , which has a height restriction of 8ft 6ins , but its trailer was simply too big to fit and stuck fast			1
after an investigation , @entity21 chiefs are positive the ancient entrance to the city has not been damaged by the lorry			1
