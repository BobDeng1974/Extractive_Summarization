it may not provide that great village shop tradition of a catch up with the latest gossip or a chat about the weather			0
but despite the lack of a human touch , this automated shop is a lifeline for residents			2
the giant vending machine opened this week in @entity12 , @entity13 , which has been without a village shop for 14 years			1
residents select their items , pay by cash or credit card and take the goods from the dispenser			0
electrical engineer @entity42 invented it after the village shop closed down			1
unable to interest a firm in developing the machine , he spent three years building one himself			1
the machine , complete with chiller compartments , has a faux red brick front and a traditional awning to give the modern shop a traditional feel			2
mr @entity42 says the machines will be introduced to other villages in the area in the next few months - claiming they could become a lifeline for small communities hit by the rise of internet shopping			2
the 50 - year - old father - of - two , from @entity63 , @entity13 , said : ' i had this idea a few years ago but i could n’t find a manufacturer who could deliver what i wanted , so i rolled up my sleeves and did it myself			1
dispensing with tradition : engineer @entity42 , 50 , has installed a giant vending machine in @entity12 , @entity13 out with the old : @entity73 buys a loaf of bread from first automated village store at @entity12 ' the result is what essentially amounts to a huge outdoor vending machine - but the term " automatic shop " is actually far more appropriate			1
' the problem with vending machines is that they ca n’t handle the range , weight , or delicacy of a wide range of products such as milk , eggs , bread , washing powder and so on			1
our shop can handle all of these and many more besides			0
' the shop is fitted with an array of security features including cameras and alarms and will be run by mr @entity42 from an industrial unit			1
gravy train : mr @entity42 hopes his unusual way of dispensing @entity104 and milk will become a far - reaching business - and save declining villages which have been hit by the rise of internet shopping he has also applied for a number of patents for his design			1
it works by lifting a small basket up to each shelf before a mechanism pushes out the desired product			0
that way it only has a small distance to travel , preventing milk bottles from bursting or eggs from smashing			2
tin of chopped tomatoes £ 0.65 six large free - range eggs £ 1.75 bottle of fairy liquid £ 1.29 tin of @entity129 £ 0.69 pint of semi-skimmed milk £ 0.59 medium sliced loaf of bread £ 1.45 small umbrella £ 2.50 he added : ' i know everything that ’s happening minute - by - minute and , uniquely , customers can also view all our stock , and its availability , live on our website			1
' his new company intends to stock each machine with local produce where possible , and @entity42 is already in talks with other publicans who are invited to host the machines without having to pay a fee			2
he said : ' i hope i can put something into the community while developing a truly 21st century piece of technology			0
' it ’s hard to compete with the supermarkets on everything , but we can get pretty close , and when you take the travel time and costs into account , we think we can compete , and bring the village shop back to the village			0
' @entity12 resident @entity165 , 56 , said : ' it ’s a magnificent thing			2
' the last village store in @entity12 closed about 14 years ago , so this is a great addition			1
before it was installed you would have to get in your car and drive almost two miles to a @entity172 ’s in @entity63 even if you just fancied a cup of tea and needed a pint of milk			0
' it is also nice to be putting money into a local business rather than a superstore			0
it stocks everyday essentials , and a little more			0
you can basically buy everything to make a full @entity186 breakfast			0
' tradition : the shop features a faux red brick front and a traditional village - style awning as decoration			0

engineer @entity42 , 50 , spent more than two years designing the machine
it has been installed 14 years after @entity12 , @entity13 , lost its last shop
residents can buy bread , milk , eggs , toiletries , pet food and umbrellas
