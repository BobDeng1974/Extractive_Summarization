by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:01 est , 5 june 2013 updated : 19:39 est , 6 june 2013 policy disarray : @entity4 leader @entity3 said he would not reverse the coalition 's cuts to child benefit for the better off @entity3 vowed yesterday to slash the cost of welfare without cutting the size of benefits			1
in a speech designed to convince voters that @entity4 can be trusted with the welfare system , he vowed to cap the overall costs of the social security system			1
mr @entity3 admitted that the last @entity4 government got benefits wrong by letting incapacity payments run out of control			1
but his attempts to turn the page were denounced as ‘ vacuous ’ after he failed to name a single new benefit that he would cut			2
he simply repeated monday ’s announcement that @entity4 would take away winter fuel benefit from wealthier pensioners – a proposal which would cut just £ 100million from the benefits budget			1
the @entity29 pointed out that mr @entity3 has opposed £ 83billion in benefit cuts during this @entity31			1
the @entity4 leader also said ‘ i do n’t agree ’ that his party spent too much money during its time in office			2
repeatedly questioned on where he would find welfare savings , he would not commit to back the government ’s decision to limit benefits rises to 1 per cent or ditch his opposition to the @entity43 ’s cuts to the spare room subsidy , better known as the bedroom tax , which cuts housing benefit when rooms are unoccupied			1
the @entity4 leader used a speech in @entity49 opposite @entity50 in @entity51 to make a bold bid to regain the upper hand in the benefits debate mr @entity3 pledged to cap total spending on welfare , but gave little detail about how it would work in practice he did not spell out at what level the cap would be set , or what would happen if a future @entity4 government breached it			1
instead , mr @entity3 claimed that he could cut the cost of welfare by getting more people back to work and driving down the costs of housing benefit by getting councils to negotiate cheaper rents with landlords			1
he told an audience in @entity51 ’s @entity49 : ‘ the next @entity4 government will have less money to spend			2
if we are going to turn our economy around , protect our @entity77 , and build a stronger country we will have to be laser - focused on how we spend every single pound			2
‘ social security spending , vital as it is , can not be exempt from that discipline			2
’ he said @entity4 , if elected , would introduce a cap on ‘ structural spending ’ – such as housing benefit and disability allowances which are not affected by sharp upturns in unemployment – for three years			1
mr @entity3 admitted voters ’ faith in the social security system had been ‘ shaken ’			1
@entity91 : mr @entity3 will call for those who have paid @entity93 for five years to get @entity94 of more than £ 100 a week - compared to £ 71 now ' no credible alternative ' : @entity97 party chairman @entity96 said mr @entity3 is too weak to deliver the tough policies that the country needs he said : ‘ successive governments did not do enough to deal with the rise in people on incapacity benefit			1
it was a legacy of unemployment from the years mrs @entity106 was in power			2
but the last @entity4 government should have acted on it sooner			0
’ mr @entity3 also spelled out plans to pay a higher rate of @entity112 ’ allowance to those who have worked for at least five years			1
the full rate of @entity112 currently kicks in when people have two years of contributions			1
‘ people ’s faith in the system has been shaken by a system that appears to give a minority of people something for nothing and other people nothing for something , ’ mr @entity3 said			1
he confirmed that he would not reverse the @entity43 ’s cuts to child benefit for high earners			0
but even that u-turn will not save him money compared with the government ’s plans			0
it means simply that he will not spend even more than the @entity43			0
mr @entity3 claimed that @entity4 is ‘ the party of work ’ and added : ‘ we will tackle the deep , long - term causes of social security spending and tackle the costs of failure , like housing benefit			1
’ he said @entity4 would also press employers to pay a ‘ living wage ’ higher than the minimum wage – a move which some businesses have claimed will actually cost jobs			0
the @entity4 leader repeatedly used the term ‘ social security ’ rather than ‘ welfare ’ , apparently because polls show that voters regard @entity4 as the ‘ welfare party ’			2
work and pensions secretary @entity167 said : ‘ they ’ve become the welfare party , they ’ve voted against £ 80billion of our savings in welfare and now we get finally a vacuous message saying they ’re kind of in favour of an overall limit but they do n’t tell us what they would cut			2
‘ having got us into this mess , today ’s speech told us nothing about how he would get us out			2
’ mr @entity167 said @entity4 had been billing yesterday ’s speech as mr @entity3 ’s ‘ big moment ’ , and added : ‘ if this is his big moment , @entity176 help us when he has a small moment			1
’ the @entity4 leader tried yesterday to restore his party ’s battered credibility on welfare with a string of policy announcements			2
here , our @entity185 editor examines if the proposals will actually work , or if they are more empty gestures			0
@entity188 : impose a limit on so - called structural benefits , which means those payments such as @entity192 which do not fluctuate with the country ’s economic fortunes			0
the cap will last three years to give ministers time to balance the @entity197 : mr @entity3 repeatedly refused to give any details on how the policy would work			1
a cap would be meaningless if it were deliberately fixed so high that it would never be reached			2
@entity4 does not support the government ’s individual benefits cap – which restricts the amount of welfare paid to families to £ 26,000 a year			1
the @entity29 say mr @entity3 has already opposed £ 83billion of welfare savings proposed by the @entity43			1
@entity209 ’s @entity208 : @entity211 welfare payments by getting the long - term jobless back into the workplace			2
the state would pay a person ’s wages for 25 hours a week , on at least the minimum wage			0
the business would provide training of at least ten hours a week			0
those who refused to take part would lose their @entity222 : will fail if the jobs do not exist			0
@entity4 is reliant on the private sector to create employment opportunities			0
yet , at the same time , mr @entity3 is threatening to reinstate the controversial 50p tax rate for high earners – penalising the very wealth creators who will determine the idea ’s success			1
also , what will he do with the rump of people who simply refuse to work ? neither @entity236 or the unions would tolerate withdrawing their benefits completely			0
@entity239 : expect employers in the private sector to pay a living wage of £ 7.45 an hour , or £ 8.55 in @entity51			0
mr @entity3 claims that , for every pound that employers pay above the minimum wage ( currently £ 6.19 ) , government would save 50p in lower tax credits and benefits			1
the state would give contracts only to firms which pay the living @entity252 : it would have a huge cost on businesses struggling their way out of recession and would cut tax income for the exchequer			0
in a scathing assessment , @entity260 , director of the @entity261 , says : ‘ there is not some sort of magic money out there that can allow big companies to pay more without any effect			0
if that money has to come from somewhere , it may come from their profits , which means less corporation tax			0
it may come from other people ’s pay which means less income tax			0
’ @entity276 : give councils the power to force private landlords to reduce the rent they charge to tenants receiving @entity282 : landlords will resent the state trying to interfere in the free market			0
they are under no obligation to rent to benefit claimants			0
many may decide no longer to bother and rent only to tenants who pay their own bills			0
@entity289 : send single mothers on courses , including @entity293 writing , when their child is aged three or four to prepare them for the @entity295 : mr @entity3 is categorical that there would be no requirement to go back to work until the youngest child is five			1
this is the status quo so the policy will not save any money			0
critics say it fails to address the issue of women who have large families who could still be reliant on benefits for a decade or more			0
@entity4 will not consider the idea of limiting child benefit to two or three children ( though it now supports axing the payments altogether for higher earners ) .			0

@entity3 will today announce he wants to cap the welfare budget
but he will also call for boost to @entity112 for those who have paid five years @entity93
