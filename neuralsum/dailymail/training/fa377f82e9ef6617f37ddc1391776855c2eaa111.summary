improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near ' 100 per cent efficiency ' in trials using mice , a leading scientist has warned			1
dr @entity7 , a geneticist at the @entity10 , said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children			1
the warning follows a breakthrough in april in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living , adult mice using the @entity22 gene editing technique			1
dr @entity7 , a geneticist from the @entity10 , said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children the @entity22 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies			1
' we used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut , ' dr @entity31 told @entity37 at the @entity38			2
' it 's a case of ' you shoot you score ' ... on the human side , one has to be very cautious			0
' unlike other gene - silencing tools , the @entity22 system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level			1
crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies the dna cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally , for instance after chronic sun exposure			1

the dna cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally , for instance after chronic sun exposure			0
but unlike uv rays that can result in genetic alterations , the @entity22 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome			1
when cellular machinery repairs the dna break , it removes a small snip of @entity51			0
in this way , researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome			2

for decades , designer babies - modified for health , beauty and intelligence - have been the reserve of science fiction			0
but @entity22 technology could change all that			2
dr @entity31 told the @entity38 that it may soon find its way into fertility treatments			0
' there are heritable diseases coded by mutations in @entity51 and some people could say , " i do n't want my children to have these mutations			0
" ' he says it is up to society , and not just scientists , to look at the implications and decide whether the technology is worth the risk			2
beyond simply addressing health concerns , many are worried that the technology can be used to give babies desirable traits , such as changing the colour of their eyes			1
@entity122 director , @entity121 , said the issue raises questions of social justice , with the technique only available to the rich			0
beyond simply addressing health concerns , many are worried that the technology can be used to give babies desirable traits , such as changing the colour of their eyes , by permanently turning off genes at the dna level the trend towards services such as this has already begun			1
for instance , @entity137 last year announced a system that can create ' virtual babies ' by digitally combining the dna of two people is set to launch			0
these virtual babies can then be screened for genetic diseases , before ruling out sperm donors or partners who could pose a risk to a potential baby 's health			2
in theory , the technology could be used to screen potential babies for traits other than diseases			2
it would also fall outside rules used to regulate embryo testing and screening			0
the technology 's patent includes a list of traits that are n't necessarily related to health – such as eye and skin pigmentation , according to a report by @entity167 in @entity168			2
' where it is more ethically challenging is when you expand beyond couples in desperate need for a donor , to couples that are just interested in more trivial things , ' @entity169 at the @entity170 told the magazine			0
professor @entity180 from the @entity182 @entity181 told the @entity184 website that despite concerns , the issue is something that needs to start being debated			0
' there has been a blanket ban on germ - line therapy , so there needs to be a debate about that and some rational thought rather than knee - jerk reactions that , " no you ca n't possibly do that			1

warning issued by dr @entity7 , a geneticist at the @entity10
it follows a study in april in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living , adult mice using the @entity22 gene editing technique
' breakthrough ' technique precisely changes target parts of genetic code
many are worried technology can be used to give babies desirable traits
*experts* says we need ' rational thought ' rather than a ' knee jerk reaction '
