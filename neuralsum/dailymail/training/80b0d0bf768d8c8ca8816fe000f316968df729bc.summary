one of the inspectors , @entity1 , was found guilty of misconduct while writing the report pressure mounted last night for an inquiry into an alleged @entity7 ' stitch - up ' of the first privately run @entity9 hospital			1
a @entity11 mp wrote to health secretary @entity12 calling for an urgent investigation into how the @entity14 came to brand @entity15 in @entity17 ' inadequate '			1
the demand came as it emerged that a @entity14 inspector was found guilty of professional misconduct while writing the damning report			1
senior paramedic @entity1 , 42 , was part of the team that unexpectedly condemned @entity24 , despite previous findings that it was one of @entity28 's best - performing hospitals			1
between the hospital 's inspection in september and the report 's publication this month , a conduct hearing upheld allegations that mr @entity1 failed to tell managers an unqualified student paramedic had given a patient morphine			2
mr @entity1 also swore abusively at his junior colleague and ' stole ' his mobile phone , a @entity41 panel ruled in october			0
the disciplinary committee found his actions amounted to misconduct and fell ' seriously below the standards expected of a registered paramedic '			2
the revelation raises questions about the @entity14 's highly critical report into @entity24 , which was published days after @entity49 , the private firm running the hospital , withdrew from its contract			1
a @entity52 said it was ' shocking ' that the inspection relied on someone found guilty of misconduct and the @entity14 had been ' seriously undermined '			1
a @entity58 investigation has provoked suspicions that the @entity14 report was directed by senior labour and union figures opposed to @entity9 privatisation			1
one inspector is linked to pressure group @entity65 , another is a former member of the doctors ' trade union , and a paediatrician standing for @entity7 at the @entity70 is believed to have heavily influenced the findings			2
@entity15 is in @entity24 , @entity17 , and serves 160,000 patients a @entity58 investigation has provoked suspicions that the @entity14 report was directed by senior labour and union figures opposed to @entity9 privatisation @entity77 , the @entity77 mp for @entity24 , where the hospital is based , has asked mr @entity12 to ' urgently start an inquiry to get to the bottom of what did or did not happen '			1
' like many others , i simply can not reconcile the negative tone of the @entity14 report with my own experience of the hospital , ' he wrote			1
' nothing that i have seen before the @entity14 report would justify calling the hospital ' inadequate '			1
' stressing he had not received any concrete evidence of ' corruption , fraud or political collusion ' , mr @entity77 added : ' the hospital has been at the receiving end of an ongoing and vicious attack by the public sector trade unions , who have perceived @entity24 to be the ' thin end of the wedge ' for what they call the ' privatisation of the @entity9 '			2
' mr @entity1 's involvement in the @entity24 report was secret until now because he is not named in the 96 - page document			1
when first contacted by the @entity58 about mr @entity1 last week , the health watchdog incorrectly claimed that the misconduct allegations against him were ' dropped ' and that he had a ' clean record in respect of his paramedic duties '			0
but in fact the @entity41 panel upheld three of four allegations made against mr @entity1 , although it decided not to impose any sanction on him			0
@entity77 ( pictured ) , the @entity112 mp for @entity24 , where the hospital is based , has asked mr @entity12 to ' urgently start an inquiry to get to the bottom of what did or did not happen ' the allegations related to a student paramedic whom mr @entity1 mentored while working as a manager for private firm @entity121			2
he discovered that the junior member of staff had given a patient morphine in july 2012 despite not being allowed to administer controlled drugs , the hearing was told			0
the @entity9 is treated like a sacred religion and it is ' taboo ' to criticise it , a @entity11 mp warned yesterday			1
@entity128 , a member of the @entity130 health committee , said the health service was ' not equipped ' to deal with 21st century problems			0
she said the ' dangerous ' tendency to regard the @entity9 as an object of faith prevented people from discussing solutions sensibly			0
miss @entity128 wrote on the @entity139 website that the @entity9 was ' at the heart of our sacred taboos '			0
she added : ' the most dangerous aspect of this ' religion ' is that it prevents anyone from sensibly discussing solutions			0
' a recent poll found that the @entity9 will be the most important issue for voters in the election			0
but mr @entity1 did not tell his bosses about the incident , instead relying on the student to inform senior managers himself			0
the @entity41 panel said this resulted in a ' potential risk to patients ' because the trainee paramedic was not formally reprimanded for his error for ten months			0
mr @entity1 later took his junior colleague 's mobile phone without permission and sent text messages from it to the student 's girlfriend			0
mr @entity1 later admitted : ' it is the most stupid thing i have ever done			0
i took the phone because i knew he had been talking about me			0
' ruling that he should not receive any punishment , the @entity41 panel concluded : ' the panel were satisfied that these events amounted to lapses in behaviour which were isolated and out of character , and which did not affect patients			0
' but @entity179 of @entity180 mep @entity178 said yesterday : ' it is shocking that in addition to the findings of @entity7 stooges , now we see that the @entity14 report on @entity24 relied on evidence from someone guilty of misconduct in their profession			1
a new independent inquiry must be carried out into the @entity24 report as a matter of urgency			2
' a woman who answered the door of mr @entity1 's house in the village of @entity200 , near @entity201 in @entity202 , referred all inquiries to the @entity14 yesterday			2
a @entity14 spokesman said : ' we have no concerns about mr @entity1 's work as an inspector or [ his ability ] to carry out his role to the highest standards with professionalism and integrity			1

@entity11 mp wrote to health secretary calling for investigation into @entity14 report
