but a recent study has found the timeworn cliché of the tight - fisted @entity7 is wholly inaccurate and it is really the @entity9 who are @entity11 's stingiest people			1
a survey of 2000 adults by mobile phone app click a taxi , found residents of @entity17 and @entity18 are twice as likely to tip their cab driver than the average @entity20			0
told ye : the old cliche that @entity24 people are tight - fisted has been proved wrong ( pictured : @entity25 as loveable @entity26 ) only one in ten @entity24 never tips , whereas that number rises to one in four in @entity9 and one in five @entity30			1
scots were found to be the most generous , tipping 90 per cent of the time , with an average tip of £ 1.02 for a £ 9 journey , 16 per cent higher than the national average of 88p and 78p in @entity9			1

' we also learned that women are more generous than men , that the older we get the more we tip and , surprisingly , the more we work , the less we tip. ' women were found to be better tippers with only 19 per cent admitting to never tipping compared to 23 per cent of men			1
age was found to be an even more inportant factor with half of @entity75 under the age of 24 not tipping compared to only eight per cent of those over the age of 65			2
