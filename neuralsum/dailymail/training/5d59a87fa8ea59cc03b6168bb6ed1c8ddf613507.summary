terrorists are trying to use a @entity3 court ruling to wipe stories about their trials from @entity6 in a move which amounts to censorship by the back door , @entity0 warned today			1
the @entity10 condemned ‘ @entity12 ’s unelected judges ’ who created the so - called ‘ right to be forgotten ’ by forcing search engines to remove links to news stories			1
in a forthright speech to newspaper editors , mr @entity0 accused @entity3 courts of ‘ trying to restrict media freedom ’ and took aim at the @entity23 for competing with news websites like @entity25			1
culture secretary @entity0 warned unaccountable @entity3 judges were ' trying to restrict media freedom ’ , creating a new right to be forgotten which amounted to ' censorship by the back door ' last month it emerged @entity6 has deleted more than 18,000 web links following requests from @entity35			1
the 15 - year campaign by the @entity39 for justice in the @entity42 murder case ‘ is what @entity35 newspapers are all about ’ , mr @entity0 said			1
he said the @entity42 family was ‘ badly let down ’ by a failure to investigate the crime properly and praised the @entity39 for a campaign that led to the jailing of two men for the killing			2
‘ the @entity39 refused to let the @entity42 family stand alone , ’ he said			2
‘ a team of talented journalists and editors did all they could to help bring @entity42 ’s killers to justice			0
not just the famous front page of february 14 , 1997 – but the 15 years of investigations , revelations and exposés that followed , keeping the case firmly in the public and political spotlight			0
‘ doing so took courage , dedication and no small measure of journalistic skill			0
’ requests from @entity35 included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure			1
@entity6 said it deleted 35 per cent , or 18,459 , of the unwanted links @entity35 requested be removed			1
mr @entity0 said the scale of the attempts to remove links to news stories was a threat to journalism			1
‘ since @entity12 ’s unelected judges created the so - called “ right to be forgotten ” , @entity6 has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds , ’ he told the @entity85 conference in @entity86			1
‘ each day , a thousand requests pour in from people who , for one reason or another , would prefer their pasts to be kept secret			0
‘ criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other , similar crimes			0
‘ terrorists have ordered @entity6 to cover up stories about their trials			2
’ the @entity101 's ‘ right to be forgotten ’ legislation allows @entity3 citizens to request that links to ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ’ information be removed from @entity6 search results mr @entity0 added : ‘ the “ right to be forgotten ” is censorship by the back door			1
stories are not being deleted from archives because of the ruling , but if they can not be found by the search engines they may as well not be there at all			0
’ newspaper websites have received notifications from @entity6 that it has deleted links to their articles			1
@entity0 questioned whether the @entity23 website should be competing with commercial news sites like @entity25			1
in his speech , the @entity10 pointed to @entity123 figures which show that almost 60 per cent of online news consumers use the @entity23 website or app , with @entity127 trailing behind on just 17 per cent			1
on mobile devices , @entity128 has 14.5 million unique users , compared to just 4.2 million for second - placed @entity127 , he said			0
' the highest - ranked newspaper , the @entity39 , is third with 3.4 million , ' he said			0
however , on closer inspection of the figures referenced by mr @entity0 , it appears the data refers to mobile readership figures for news on the @entity23 and on @entity127 not to @entity128 and @entity127			1
he continued : ' this digital dominance looks set to be cemented as this generation grows up			0
' most adults aged under 24 already head to the internet – rather than tv , radio or print – for their fix of news			0
' as with so many of the changes brought about by the internet , it raises a lot of questions			0
' is it healthy for a publicly funded broadcaster to compete with commercial newspapers ? ' should the @entity23 share its local public service content under a creative commons licence ? ' @entity25 publisher @entity156 has said : ‘ it is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you do n’t like			1
’ the @entity161 ruled people had a right to ask for ‘ inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant , or excessive ’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches			0
the decision – which can not be appealed against and is binding for all @entity101 states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information			2
but once search engines like @entity6 drop links to such material , it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet			2
@entity176 was the site which had the most links removed , followed by the social network search site @entity180 and video sharing site @entity182			1
@entity6 gave anonymised examples of requests it had received			2
in @entity35 , they included the former clergyman who asked for two links to articles about a sex abuse investigation while he was still a religious leader to be removed			0
the search engine refused his request , and said it considered ‘ the rights of the individual as well as public interest in the content ’ when assessing each request			2
@entity6 also refused an application from a doctor who wanted more than 50 links to articles about a botched procedure removed			2
three pages that contained personal information about the doctor but not about the procedure were removed from search results for his name , but links to reports about the incident were not deleted			0
@entity3 's top court ruled that people have the right to have ' inadequate ' and ' irrelevant ' results about them wiped from the web , which has led to the search engine being bombarded with requests			0
more than 90,000 removal requests involving more than 328,000 urls have been made to @entity6 worldwide			0
the content itself has not been deleted from @entity25 , but @entity6 will not list it in search results			1
instead , users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says : ‘ some results may have been removed under data protection law in @entity3 ’ at the bottom of the page			2
the latest articles to be removed from @entity25 include : the @entity232 , @entity233 17 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			1
under @entity233 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			0
' this relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered illegally			0
the @entity101 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data ’			2
the @entity260 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove it			0
if a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			0
