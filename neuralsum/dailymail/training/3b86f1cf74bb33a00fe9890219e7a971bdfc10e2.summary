by @entity1 reporter published : 13:42 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 14:43 est , 2 january 2014 a blind , housebound pensioner was left without a vital telephone connection since christmas eve after @entity7 bosses decided her case ' was not a priority ' , it was revealed today			2
@entity10 , 89 , lives alone in @entity11 , @entity12 , and is reliant on her phone to speak to family , friends and neighbours who help her			1
but she has been left feeling isolated and ' extremely upset ' after her phone line suddenly went down on @entity18			1
despite numerous emails to @entity20 by her family pleading for an engineer to fix the problem her case was dismissed as not coming under ' the priority care team '			1
cut off : @entity10 , 89 , lives alone in @entity11 , @entity12 , and is reliant on her phone to speak to family , friends and neighbours who help her as a result , her phone line remains dead			1
son @entity28 , 64 , said his family 's @entity18 and @entity29 was ruined because they were so worried something would happen to his mum and they would n't find out until it was too late			1
mr @entity28 said : ' she is panicking , it is just stress on top of everything else			2
she just keeps thinking , what happens if i fall ? if she has a fall at 5pm i would n't know until 9am the next day			2
' we try to visit her twice a day and neighbours pop in occasionally , but she relies on her phone to communicate with people			1
it is quite frightening , it is not a nice feeling to think you are totally isolated			2
' the worst possible case scenario is she has one of her falls and we get there the following morning and she is dead			2
that is the worst case scenario , and how would @entity7 feel then ? ' mrs @entity10 , a widow who is unsteady on her feet and can only walk with the aid of a stick , has no mobile phone coverage where she lives and is totally reliant on her land line to communicate			1
she has lost her sight over the past year which has left her too scared to leave the house alone , and has a panic alarm fitted at her home in case she falls			0
@entity20 said it is trying to repair mrs @entity10 's phone line as quickly as possible mr @entity28 , who runs a liqueur company called @entity70 , lives nine miles away from his mother and tries to pop in to see her twice a day to check she is ok			1
but he is terrified that she will take a nasty tumble when no one is with her and there will be no way for her to call anyone for help			2
he said : ' she has gone blind in the past year			0
she is out in the middle of the countryside and she ca n't go for a walk on her own because she is too frightened			0
' she is a little unsteady on her feet and her balance is going because of her lack of sight			0
' mrs @entity10 phone line is run through the @entity86 and went dead on christmas eve			1
but her family did not manage to get through to the firm until december 27 because it was closed on bank holidays			2
when mr @entity28 finally managed to speak to someone he was told to contact @entity20 which runs the physical phone lines			1
but despite being told mrs @entity10 was frail , blind and effectively housebound , they deemed she was not a priority case			1
mr @entity28 said : ' someone at @entity20 decided that she was n't in a serious enough situation to go to the @entity97 , which is absolutely ridiculous			1
' it is absolutely outrageous			0
i 've been trying not to get too angry about it , but it 's absolutely appalling			0
it is ridiculous , they are letting down a vulnerable pensioner			0
they are just not caring			0
' @entity20 are totally uncontactable - they are a world to their own			1
' after firing off a string of emails to their customer care department , mr @entity28 was eventually put through to someone on december 30 who said they would n't be able to look at the problem for another two days			2
and he was sent an email by @entity118 , a senior manager at @entity7 , apologising for the problems his mother was experiencing , but saying he was unable to help because it related to another department			0
mr @entity28 said : ' it is just a case of passing the buck			0
if a department in my business told a customer â€˜ it 's not my department , i ca n't help ' i would be bust in a year			0
' it has really blighted our family 's @entity18 and @entity29			1
i have spending all my time on the internet trying to contact someone all @entity18 , but to no avail			1
we have all been really worried			0
' i have a brother living in @entity140 and he 's been frantic because he has n't been able to get through to our mum			0
and my mother has been really upset			0
' an @entity20 spokesman said : ' @entity20 is trying to repair mrs @entity10 's phone line as quickly as possible , having been alerted to the problem by mrs @entity10 's phone supplier on december 27			1
' an engineer has already been dispatched and discovered a faulty overhead cable			0
in order to replace the cable we need to block the road and arrange for temporary traffic lights			0
' this requires permission from the local council which we are trying to arrange as a matter of urgency			0

@entity10 lives alone in @entity11 , @entity12
she is reliant on her phone to speak to family and call for help
but her phone line suddenly went down on @entity18
despite numerous family emails to @entity20 , it remains dead
