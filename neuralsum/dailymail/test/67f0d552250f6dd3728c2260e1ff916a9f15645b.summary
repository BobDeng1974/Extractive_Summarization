there was uproar on the south coast when @entity3 sacked local hero @entity4 and replaced him with the relatively unknown @entity5 , on @entity7 shores at least , @entity8			1
@entity9 had led @entity10 to back - to - back promotions into the @entity12 and was fighting valiantly to keep them in it			1
but @entity3 ’s decision proved to be an astute one and @entity8 took them to the next level			1
he increased intensity in training and in matches , altered their style of play , continued their already excellent emphasis on youth and made some shrewd signings			2
@entity8 spent 16 months as @entity10 manager before departing to @entity29 the @entity5 manager ( right ) embraces @entity31 ( left ) as he took on his former side in october so much so that 16 months later @entity33 saw him as the ideal man to take @entity29 on , too			1
as @entity8 prepares to return to @entity36 ’s for the first time since he left , @entity35 takes a look at how his two tenures compare			1
you do n’t win anything with kids … @entity8 came to @entity43 with a reputation for bringing through young players - at @entity46 he handed 25 of their youth products a debut			1
at @entity10 he continued to show no fear in throwing them in , giving @entity12 debuts to @entity52 , who then moved to @entity53 for £ 16million and has now won senior @entity43 caps , and @entity55 , who is a first - team regular , star of @entity58 and set for a call up by @entity60			1
@entity8 has maintained that approach at @entity29			1
he was the first , of many managers who came before , to give @entity63 a proper run in the team and this season the player earned a first @entity43 cap for his displays			2
@entity52 ( left ) and @entity55 ( right ) both rose to prominence under @entity8 @entity71 has flourished under him , too , already around the first team before his arrival albeit , but excelling under @entity8 ’s guidance and scoring a sensational 31 goals in all competitions already this season			1
@entity78 is another who has progressed under @entity8 after @entity80 gave him a chance last season , while @entity8 also gave @entity83 , a 19 - year - old midfielder , his first appearance from the bench in the @entity86			2
@entity71 has been in sensational form under the former @entity10 boss this season - scoring 31 times 2011 - 12 : 4th ( @entity90 as manager ) 2012 - 13 : 5th ( @entity92 as manager ) 2013 - 14 : 6th ( @entity80 as manager ) 2014 - 15 * currently 7th ( @entity8 ) lung - busting training training sessions under @entity8 have become almost mythical			1
speak to any player who has worked under him and they all recall gruelling double and triple sessions , all throughout pre-season and maintained regularly during the campaign			0
at @entity10 when he first arrived he took the team to a @entity105 boot camp and made the players , leading himself by example , walk over hot coals			1
not satisfied by their fitness levels , during that first pre-season there would be frequent triple sessions , from 10am - midday , from 2pm - 4pm and from 6pm - 8pm			0
during the season , in a typical week he would insist on hard sessions on tuesdays and wednesday - often double or triple			0
on the pitch , it got results			0
@entity8 ( left ) has deployed strict and grueling training methods at both @entity29 and @entity10 it appears there is more of the same at @entity29			1
‘ there ’s not been a good moment in pre-season , if i ’m honest , ’ @entity71 said earlier this season			2
‘ there were double sessions , times when you were pushing yourself to the limit , but you ’re doing it for a reason			0
this is the reason that you ’re seeing now			0
’ team - mate @entity135 echoed that sentiment , adding : ‘ the training sessions are hard , we feel already that we have become more and more fit and that ’s very good for us			0
’ passing and pressing philosophy like many managers , @entity8 has a certain philosophy and is relentlessly demanding that it is reflected on the pitch			1
at goal kicks the centre halves drop wide around the penalty area , the full backs push 40 yards up the pitch and one of the two central midfielders moves to the edge of the box , giving the goalkeeper options to pass everywhere			0
a passing and pressing philosophy has been deployed by @entity8 throughout his managerial career when they are not in possession , pressing is expected high up the pitch - hence the punishing pursuit of supreme fitness levels in training			1
@entity29 players have taken a while to get used to it , longer than it took @entity10 players when @entity8 was first in charge			1
but there have been signs , when they were beaten once in 10 games and were challenging for the @entity172 , that it can work there			0
enhancing individuals in @entity8 ’s role as ‘ head coach ’ as opposed to all - round manager he has more time to work with individuals , if they go to him desiring to improve their game			1
two of @entity10 ’s current stars , @entity184 and @entity185 , credit the 43 - year - old for their progression			2
‘ he brought the best out of me and gave me self - belief , ’ @entity184 said after his departure			0
‘ to work with him was brilliant , it was hard work but the lads loved it and we got results			0
@entity185 ( left ) has credited @entity8 for his development while he was in charge @entity184 says @entity8 gave him the ' self belief ' to develop as a player ‘ his tactical awareness gave you confidence , you wanted to go out for him because he ’s such a great guy			2
you can talk to him			0
the players respected him so much			2
’ @entity185 said : ‘ he ’d have us pressing high , keeping a high line , receiving the ball in difficult situations , keeping possession and basically having the confidence to play football rather than being afraid			2
' the understanding in our defence was down to our training			0
personally , it took my game to another level			0
’ @entity220 the transfer success - rate at both clubs has been similar ; solid but not outstanding			0
at @entity10 he made very few - @entity224 proved a snip at £ 8.5m and was sold on for double that			2
@entity227 seemed pricey at £ 12.5m but is one of their most consistent performers and will turn a profit if he moves on soon			0
@entity232 cost £ 15m and ended up attacking a team - mate			0
@entity227 was a big - money signing from @entity8 , but has turned out to be a success equally , at @entity29 @entity236 at £ 4m looks like a future @entity43 international , whereas @entity238 for £ 10m could prove too much			1
teenager @entity239 is likely to be a steal at £ 5m			0
the others - @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 - are yet to shine			0
@entity245 @entity8 would barely ever speak to the press - in tv , radio or to print journalists - in @entity7 while he was at @entity10			1
yet occasionally when he was talking after pre-match press conferences , with the cameras and microphones off , he would talk in perfectly understandable @entity7			0
at @entity29 from the very start he conducted entire press conferences in @entity7 and has trusted assistant @entity258 to occasionally turn to for help with any misunderstanding			2
the @entity29 boss has spoken in @entity7 in his entire press conferences at @entity29			1

@entity8 returns to former side @entity10 for the first time since leaving last *summer*
the @entity29 boss done an excellent job during his 16 month spell
the @entity5 manager has adopted the same methods at @entity29 as he did during his time at @entity36 *'s*
@entity8 *blooded* the likes of @entity52 and @entity55 while at @entity10 , and has done the same with @entity71 at @entity29
his passing and pressing philosophy has taken a while for his new set of players to adjust to , though
