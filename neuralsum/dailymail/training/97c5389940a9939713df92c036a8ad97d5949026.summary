by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 14 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:03 est , 14 february 2014 @entity3 has insisted that tv gardeners like him were not responsible for causing floods by encouraging homeowners to pave over their gardeners			1
a government adviser had previously suggested that gardening trends had worsened the flooding crisis by reducing the ability of the ground to absorb rainwater			1
the row comes as climate change activists step up their campaign to pin the cause of the floods which have ravaged @entity19 on global warming			1
not guilty : @entity3 says that tv gardeners have not been causing floods by encouraging householders to pave over their gardens claims : lord @entity26 , left , has suggesting that gardening programmes exacerbate flood risks , while @entity29 , right , pins the blame on global warming @entity29 , the author of a controversial official report on climate change , insisted that rainfall was becoming ' ever more intense ' and called for action to prevent ' devastating consequences ' such as global conflict			1
thousands of homes have been flooded in the @entity39 and the @entity40 after two months of rain has left rivers swollen and the ground saturated			0
and while most people have blamed inadequate preparation from the @entity47 and the unprecedented levels of rainfall , a leading scientist has proposed an alternative explanation			0
@entity51 , the head of @entity52 , @entity53 and a @entity55 adviser on climate change , blamed tv gardening shows for starting a trend of paving over gardens with concrete driveways , decking and patios			1
these renovations can worsen storms by preventing water seeping into the ground , forcing it to run off elsewhere , he said			0
disaster : the village of @entity69 in the @entity39 has been left almost completely underwater satellite images show that the proportion of gardens in @entity74 towns and cities which have been paved over nearly double between 2001 and 2011			2
' we need tv gardeners to tell people not to put down patios and decking and have a lawn instead , ' @entity51 said in a recent report on the future of flood risks			1
' flooding can have a devastating impact on people 's lives and livelihoods			0
how we adapt to these risks will be critically important to our future resilience , whether it 's deciding not to pave over our gardens , or building in less exposed areas			0
' he said there should be a campaign to ' get tv gardeners to tell people to stop putting down decking and paving and have lawns instead '			2
but mr @entity3 , who became @entity19 's best - known gardener during six years of presenting @entity104 , insisted that tv personalities like him were not to blame			2
drenched : @entity106 is also heavily affected by flooding after the @entity108 burst its banks ' tv gardeners do not advocate paving over entire gardens , simply a small area in which to sit , ' he told the @entity114			1
describing @entity51 's claim as ' laughable ' , mr @entity3 instead pinned responsibility on the government for failing to maintain waterways properly			1
' the neglect of ditch clearing and dredging water courses has a far greater impact on surface water than the government seems to acknowledge , ' he said			2
the controversy coincides with a new push to link the floods to the impact of climate change			1
@entity131 said last month that he ' very much suspects ' that the recent weeks of extreme weather can be pinned on global warming			2
@entity29 , the author of a major report on the economic effects of climate change , today claimed that the wet and stormy conditions were ' no coincidence '			2
waders : a man makes his way through the floodwater at @entity144 , next to the @entity40 writing in the @entity145 , he said : ' if we do not cut emissions , we face even more devastating consequences			0
' the economist claimed that global climate change could lead to ' mass migration of hundreds of millions of people away from the worst - affected areas '			1
he concluded : ' that would lead to conflict and war , not peace and prosperity			0
' @entity160 envoy @entity159 said that global warming was a ' driver of disaster ' and claimed the government should have stepped in decades ago			1
' the science has been clear that climate variability is a driver of disaster for 40 , 50 years , ' she told @entity170 's today programme			0
' the science has been clear for decades already			0
we should have acted 10 , 20 years ago			0
' the @entity174 disaster expert , who is the secretary general 's special representative for disaster risk reduction , called on officials to reduce building on flood plains in order to reduce the number of people affected in the event of flooding			0
officials responsible for maintaining the @entity39 have warned that it may be necessary to move residents away from the low - lying area over the next few decades if rising sea levels make it more vulnerable .			0
