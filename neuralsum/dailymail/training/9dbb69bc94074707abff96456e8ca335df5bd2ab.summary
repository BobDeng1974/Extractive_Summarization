43 % of @entity0 keep photos of former partners following a break - up one in five men hide these photos for fear of their new partner disapproving by @entity8 published : 04:23 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 07:09 est , 26 july 2012 no break up is easy			1
from the memories you shared to ' your song ' , it is hard to forget about a former lover overnight			0
while millionairess @entity16 has tasked bodyguards with ridding her home of every trace of her love rat ex-boyfriend @entity20 , new research shows that not all of us are that strong - willed			2
the new study , by @entity23 , shows many of us ca n’t bring ourselves to be so cut - throat with the latest findings revealing that 21.6 million brits have held onto photographs of former partners following a break up			1
will @entity32 finally have taken down her poster of @entity34 that she kept on her wall as a teenager ? women are more sentimental than men , with 61 per cent claiming they keep the photos as they highlight a part of their life they do n’t want to forget , versus 56 per cent of men			2
but men may be hiding more from their partners than their other halves realise			2
one in five men ( 20 % ) in a current relationship who have photos of their ex partners say they have hidden photos of an ex fearing disapproval from their new partner , compared to only nine per cent of women			1
men also seem to have more weighing on their conscience , as 17 per cent said they ‘ sometimes feel guilty about keeping photos of their ex partners ’ , compared to just 11 per cent of their female counterparts			1
@entity62 has struggled to find a permanent lover since her split with heartthrob @entity65 they may have good reason for this , however , as more than one in ten men who keep photos of their ex partners ( 12 per cent ) admit they still have feelings for their ex , compared to only five percent of women			1
@entity74 , behavioral psychologist said : ' it ’s not surprising that nearly half of us keep some kind of visual memento of past partners ; a photo generates strong emotions as it unleashes memories of past attachment and times			0
' the main reason people hide their photos ( especially men ) is probably due to a fear of their current partner ’s jealousy , or of evoking comparisons in terms of attractiveness and sexiness , etc. emotionally mature partners will be able to accept you have a past love - life			1
does @entity100 treasure this romantic snap of her and @entity102 taken in happier times in 2008 ? ' the point at which people are able to put an ex-partner ’s photo away ( after a split , divorce or death ) is usually the time they are emotionally ready to move on			0
' yet , it is totally understandable for people to keep photos to remind them of previous loves , as , indeed , these images do form part of our life stories – whether for better or for worse			0
' the majority of us ( 48 per cent ) keep these snaps in old photo albums , but others ( 31 per cent ) stash them in cupboards and drawers , or in the attic ( 12 % )			0
nine per cent of men say they purposely keep the photos in hidden files on their computer			2
@entity132 , @entity133 , said : ' we all have photos from our past we want to keep ; whether we want to share with others , or remain private			0
' old photos are often the best – they bring back memories and blasts from the pasts , even if we think we ’d sometimes prefer to forget ! the new friends reunited site is the one place you can search , collect and save treasured personal memories , especially old photos that have a special place in our hearts and you make them totally private if you want too ! ' it was part of my life / growing up that i do n’t want to forget they bring back good memories i do n’t like throwing any photos away they remind me of a special event i look good in the photos they make me laugh i still have feelings for my ex i think we may get back together one day so i can use them against him / her one day			0
