freedom to jog naked : @entity1 , 47 , won his appeal against offensive behaviour the right to go jogging in the nude has been upheld by the @entity8 in @entity9			1
@entity1 , 47 , was wearing only a pair of shoes when he was spotted by a woman while running at 8.30am in a forest near @entity14 in august last year			1
she called police and he was arrested during another nude run			0
@entity1 was charged with offensive behaviour and found guilty in @entity19 last december			1
an appeal was thrown out in june , but a second appeal has just been upheld by justice @entity22 in the @entity8 at @entity14			1
' if it was [ offensive ] then @entity23 would n't have given us genitals , ' mr @entity1 told @entity27			2
' it is a win for all libertarians and a setback for all conservatives in the country			0
' the judge , @entity33 , compared the situation to passing ' gang members ' walking through the park			2
he said : ' it would not be surprising for a person in the position of the complainant to be concerned and discomforted by their presence , and even to feel threatened			2
' however , on any view , their behaviour would not be regarded as offensive behaviour			1
' should the sight of a naked man , in the circumstances in which the complainant found herself , be treated any differently ? i think not			1
' he added that he felt @entity53 was ' a genuine naturist ' who had taken measures to avoid disturbing others - such as choosing a time when children would be unlikely to be on the track			0
but @entity61 spokesman @entity60 said he was disappointed and said @entity33 's decision shows ' double standards '			0
he asked : ' is it okay for someone to streak through his courtroom ? he 'd be the first one to put them in the cells			0
' picturesque : the jogger was spotted close to @entity14 harbour in @entity9 @entity72 mr @entity1 said he enjoyed the freedom of not wearing clothes and began running naked about 18 months ago			1
the complainant , who was out walking her dog when she spotted @entity53 , said she was so offended that she did not wish to ever return to the @entity77			1
but @entity1 lashed out at the woman who complained			0
he said : ' it 's just ludicrous			0
has this person got nothing better to do than wasting everyone 's time ? ' all she saw was a naked man running through the bush			2
it was just a fleeting moment , which has cost us all			0
' it just shows that it was a stupid decision by police to go ahead ... and charge me for something totally irrelevant			0

shocked complainant said she would never walk her dog in @entity95 , @entity9 , again
@entity97 , 47 , was charged with offensive behaviour for his naked runs
but appeal judge agrees that naked body by itself is not offensive
