by @entity0 shortly after being appointed chairman of the @entity3 last summer , @entity1 declared that one of his main targets was to see @entity6 win the @entity7 in the desert heat of @entity9 in 2022			1
he said he was aware that such a target could create pressure on players but he was undeterred			2
‘ top players must be able to handle pressure if they want to be winners			2
we want to be winners , ’ he boomed			2
the ensuing derision was deafening			2
a few months on , at the draw for the @entity7 finals , the cameras caught @entity1 making a flamboyant cut - throat gesture as @entity6 ’s opening match in @entity22 was announced			1
there was an eruption of derision for his public display of despair			2
big idea : @entity3 chairman @entity1 reveals the idea for @entity31 @entity30 on thursday , as the centrepiece of his grandiose @entity33 , @entity1 announced a plan to introduce @entity31 b teams into the @entity36 by the year 2016 - 17			1
the details of this dismantling of a 100 - year - old ‘ pyramid ’ are still evolving but the clamorous derision it provoked was encapsulated in one sublime tweet from @entity44 : ‘ in 2016 - 17 we can achieve our dream … we ’ll finally be able to play @entity46 in the @entity36			2
’ @entity47 has a meeting this week with @entity49			2
with his job on the line , the @entity51 manager will attempt to persuade the club owner that 50,000 @entity51 can be wrong			2
at such times , @entity47 likes to quote a piece of cod philosophy			2
‘ life is a rocky road , ’ he says			2
‘ and when it gets rocky , you have to stay strong and focused			2
’ the voice of the great @entity64 floats back down the years : ‘ if you want the rainbow , you ’ve got to put up with the rain			0
do you know which “ philosopher ” said that ? @entity68			0
and people say she ’s just a big pair of tits			0
’ i sense a pattern emerging here , and its thread is the personality of chairman @entity1			1
as his brilliant career in media and commerce would suggest , this is a man of enormous ability , with bubbling self - confidence and a tumbling stream of ideas			0
but , as his experience at the @entity3 vividly demonstrates , those virtues are occasionally accompanied by a curiously naive desire to make an extravagant impact , to pose at the centre of events			1
the @entity7 ‘ target ’ was the kind of thing which might have been spouted by a third - rate politician , while the ‘ cut - throat ’ affair smacked of simple showing - off			1
but the latest episode is more complicated and a good deal more troubling			1
for the fact is that @entity1 ’s @entity33 have illuminated some long - standing problems and have come up with some thoughtful solutions			1
the fact that only 32 per cent of players who started @entity31 matches in the 2012 - 13 season were qualified to play for @entity6 is a disturbing statistic			1
in @entity110 , the starting figure for @entity110 players was 59 per cent , while in @entity111 and @entity112 almost 50 per cent were qualified for the national teams			0
to cite such statistics is not to promote some crass , @entity116 fear of @entity117 ; rather , it is to illustrate the scope of the problem which faces the @entity6 manager , @entity121			1
bad move : @entity1 mimics cutting his throat after @entity6 's group for the @entity7 is announced raise your game : @entity127 claims lower league players will raise their game against reserve sides @entity1 ’s @entity33 propose that the number of home - grown players required in a @entity31 squad of 25 should be increased from eight to 13 and , in a smaller @entity36 squad , from six to 12			1
they also demand drastic reform of the flawed process by which clubs can sign players who do not hold a @entity142 passport and believe there should be a cap of two @entity146 players in any @entity31 squad			1
both of which address the way in which a stream of low - priced mediocrities infiltrate the @entity154 game			0
come the autumn , there will be potentially valuable reports on our gross under - investment in coaching and the embarrassing neglect of grassroots facilities			0
but such measures do not make a headline or lead a television news bulletin			0
they are not what @entity1 sees as a @entity167			1
and so we were treated to the b teams notion , a palpable nonsense which distorts a decent competition , demeans a host of small , proud clubs and offers little but worthless confusion to ambitious players parachuted in from the @entity31			1
@entity127 , once an agricultural full - back and now a member of @entity178 , attempted to sell the dubious fantasy to a still more dubious public			0
‘ i guarantee that every single player that plays against them ( the cossetted tyros of the @entity31 ) will raise their game , ’ he said			1
‘ there will be a pride , there will be an ego and it ’ll be , “ we do not want these little upstarts with loads of money to come and beat us ”			0
’ what a pretty picture that paints and what an appealing prospect it opens up ! fear and loathing in @entity202 ; who could resist it ? it was the same @entity205 , incidentally , who reflected : ‘ if @entity6 were to win the @entity7 , it would be the exception rather than the rule			1
’ small wonder that @entity1 was so anxious to have the sage on board			1
man with a plan : @entity1 and his report has attracted plenty of publicity opposition to the proposal is growing by the day , beginning with the @entity218 and @entity219 and continuing through the @entity220 and the unconsulted masses of football fans			1
there must be a real chance that the entire project will be swept away in the storm of protest and derision			0
given the work which has gone into the saner parts of the scheme , that would be a great shame			0
yet if it should happen , then @entity1 will have only himself to blame			1
as a reforming chairman of the @entity3 , he has much to offer the national game			1
but as a frustrated song and dance man , courting the spotlight and remorselessly seeking the next @entity167 , he is betraying a rare and valuable talent			0
@entity121 can only go with what he ’s got after his remarkable playing career , the late @entity242 found football management rather more difficult			1
he toiled at the trade but the bad days outnumbered the good			2
on one such day , as he sat cursing in the dugout , he decided to make a substitution			0
‘ who would you like to bring on , boss ? ’ , asked his assistant			0
‘ well , @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 for starters , ’ he said			0
‘ but i reckon i ’ll have to make do with what i ’ve got ’			0
decision time : @entity121 names his squad for the @entity7 this week @entity121 will recognise the feeling			1
when he announces his @entity7 squad on monday , @entity121 will strike an optimistic tone			1
yet he will surely experience pangs of apprehension			0
essentially , his chosen 23 selects itself because there are few alternatives to whom he can turn			0
for what it ’s worth , my own version would be : goalkeepers : @entity276 ( @entity277 ) , @entity278 ( @entity279 ) , @entity280 ( @entity281 )			0
defenders : @entity284 ( @entity283 ) , @entity285 ( @entity286 ) , @entity287 ( @entity288 ) , @entity289 ( @entity290 ) , @entity291 ( @entity292 ) , @entity293 ( @entity288 ) , @entity296 ( @entity286 ) , @entity295 ( @entity294 )			0
midfielders : @entity298 ( @entity283 ) , @entity299 ( @entity294 ) , @entity302 ( @entity283 ) , @entity301 ( @entity300 ) , @entity303 ( @entity300 ) , @entity304 ( @entity277 ) , @entity305 ( @entity283 ) , @entity306 ( @entity288 )			0
strikers : @entity309 ( @entity292 ) , @entity310 ( @entity292 ) , @entity308 ( @entity283 ) , @entity311 ( @entity294 )			0
no go : @entity313 looks unlikely to be included in the @entity7 squad young star : @entity294 's @entity295 is a possible contender for the @entity6 squad astonishingly , there has been some support for @entity313 , the primitive striker who has scored twice in 14 appearances for @entity320 this season			1
equally bizarre is the campaign to include the 35 - year - old @entity323 , on the grounds that he is an affable fellow who will spread good cheer			2
if @entity6 really need to accommodate an amiable midfielder whose best days are far behind him , then sir @entity326 must be in with a shout			0
far better , i suggest , to risk overloading the quota of full - backs and offer the experience to @entity295 , whose professional future seems thrillingly predictable			0
so there it is ; scarcely a collection to terrify @entity337 , @entity111 , @entity110 or @entity338 , far less @entity339			0
but , in the absence of a @entity341 , @entity256 or @entity257 , then @entity121 must make do with what he ’s got .			1

@entity3 chairman @entity1 keen to introduce @entity31 @entity30
@entity347 proposal *overshadows* other good points made in the report
@entity121 has limited options *ahead* of @entity7 squad *announcement*
