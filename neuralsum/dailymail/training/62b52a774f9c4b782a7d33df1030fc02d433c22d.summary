the murder of aid worker @entity1 backfired for @entity2 as it ' shifted @entity4 opinion ' against the militant group , according to an anti-radicalisation expert			1
@entity8 specialist @entity7 says the orchestrated killing of the @entity11 taxi driver led the vast majority of @entity13 to realise the group were beyond the pale			0
the 47 - year - old was beheaded by @entity18 ( @entity2 ) militants in a video released on social media after he was captured in december while delivering food and supplies to @entity24 refugees			1
@entity11 taxi driver @entity1 went to @entity24 to help refugees forced to leave their homes by civil war , but he was captured by @entity2 extremists and beheaded in a video broadcast by the group but a @entity8 expert says his killing - at the hands of @entity32 ' - has shifted @entity4 opinion against the group and could deter young @entity34 @entity13 from travelling to the region to fight mr @entity7 is a national safeguarding mentor for @entity36 , the @entity8 's scheme to prevent adults and children becoming involved in terrorism			1
he said mr @entity1 's brutal killing shocked @entity13 around the world and will deter many from going to the region to fight alongside the group			1
mr @entity7 told @entity45 : ' the announcement that they were going to execute him , kill him - this really did shift public opinion and it shifted @entity4 opinion wholesale			1
' i would personally say to @entity1 's family : do not think his death has been some type of waste because it has n't , because his death at the hands of @entity57 is the very thing that has caused the @entity4 community to realise that what is stands for is wrong and can never be condoned			2
' in @entity1 's death he has managed to save thousands of lives now and in the future of people who might potentially have been drawn into going out			0
' he will be saving lives in the future			0
what is has done has backfired			0
' @entity8 expert @entity7 urged mr @entity1 's family not to think his death has been in vain mr @entity7 said the killing could , in the longer term , help to save ' many thousands of lives ' mr @entity7 added that the greatest threat from radicalisation now came from online content , and those travelling to a foreign country or being influenced by a single preacher happened ' much more rarely '			1
fellow briton @entity79 was also executed by @entity2 militants , following the murders of @entity83 journalists @entity84 and @entity85 , while another @entity79 , journalist @entity86 , remains in the hands of the terrorist group			2
the group appear to have changed strategy since the release of the series of beheading videos , with more recent films showing mr @entity86 apparently reading a prepared script of the group 's propaganda			2
he was most recently seen last month in news broadcast - style footage in which the militants used him to air their claims that they hold much of battle - ravaged city of @entity103			0
