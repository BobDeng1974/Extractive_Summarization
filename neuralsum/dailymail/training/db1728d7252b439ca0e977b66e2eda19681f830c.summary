by @entity0 published : 11:13 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 19:30 est , 26 july 2013 the @entity1 has revealed he sometimes feels like he ‘ is in a cage ’			0
@entity3 , in @entity4 on his first overseas trip , said he felt confined by the security that goes with his position			2
‘ i feel as if i ’m in a cage , ’ he told young @entity8 in @entity9			1
‘ i ’d like to be closer to you , but i can not for reasons of public order			0
pray for me , i need your prayers			0
he leads one of the world 's biggest churches , his words are devoutly heeded and his presence draws in thousands upon thousands of dedicated followers			2
but despite his awesome power , @entity3 could n't control his clothes , as a gust of wind caused havoc , wrapping part of his robe around his face			2
the leader of the @entity8 was leading a mass on @entity9 's @entity45 - but strong gusts of wind and rain showers caused his clothes to flutter and wind around his throat			1
but the @entity51 - born @entity8 refused to let it stop him , and continued with the mass , which was attended by thousands who did not let the driving rain deter them from hearing his service			2
pope @entity3 delivers a speech to @entity8 faithful at @entity45 in @entity9 carrying on : pope @entity3 is in @entity20 for the celebration of the @entity59 - and delivered a mass while the wind whipped his clothes @entity3 addressed the young pilgrims who braved the wind and rain to gather on the famous beach continuing his approach of being a modest pope , he celebrated @entity68 with his fellow @entity69 and heard confessions from young pilgrims in a @entity9 park today , ahead of one of the most solemn events of @entity59 , a re-enactment of @entity77 's crucifixion held at one of @entity80 's most iconic locations , @entity45			1
@entity3 also offered a noontime prayer and meeting with a group of juvenile detainees , a priority of his ever since his days as archbishop of @entity87 and an expression of his belief that the @entity8 must reach out to the most marginalized and forgotten of society			2
even now as pope , he calls a group of youths in a @entity87 detention center every two weeks just to keep in touch			0
in the @entity80 park , a white tent was set up to receive the faithful for confession , with small makeshift confession booths off to the side			1
five youths , chosen through a raffle , were selected to go to confession with @entity3 , the sacrament in which @entity8 confess their sins and are forgiven			2
this is pope @entity3 's first trip overseas since he was elected to lead the @entity8 ' it was just five minutes , it followed the regular ritual of confession , but then @entity3 stayed and talked with us , ' said one of the five , @entity113 , 21 , a student from @entity114 , @entity115			1
' it was all very personal			0
he told us that young people have the responsibility of keeping the church alive and spreading the word of @entity77			0
' the sun finally came out today , ending four days of rain that soaked pilgrims and forced the relocation of the festival 's culminating @entity68 on sunday			1
instead , the @entity68 and the saturday night vigil that precedes it will take place at @entity45 rather than the mud pit that is the @entity133 field , some 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) west of central @entity80			1
last night @entity3 showed off his rebellious side , urging young @entity8 to shake up the church and make a ' mess ' in their dioceses by going out into the streets to spread the faith			1
it 's a message he put into practice by visiting one of @entity80 's most violent slums and officially opening @entity59 on a rain - soaked @entity45			1
@entity3 was elected pope on a mandate to reform the church , and in four short months he has started doing just that			1
he has broken long - held @entity148 rules on everything from where he lays his head at night to how saints are made			0
last night , thousands took to the famous beach so they could hear the pope - who has asked for a ' poor church ' - to speak participants of @entity59 waited on @entity45 for the arrival of @entity3 in @entity9 last night he has cast off his security detail to get close to his flock , and his first international foray as pope has shown the faithful appreciate the gesture			1
dubbed the ' slum pope ' for his work with the poor , @entity3 received a rapturous welcome in the @entity169 on thursday , part of a slum area of northern rio so violent it 's known as the @entity173			1
the 76 - year - old @entity51 seemed entirely at home , wading into cheering crowds , kissing people young and old and telling them the @entity8 is on their side			0
the @entity169 visit was one of the highlights of @entity3 ' weeklong trip to @entity20 , his first as pope			1
the surprise , though , came during his encounter with @entity51 pilgrims , scheduled at the last minute in yet another sign of how this spontaneous pope is shaking up the @entity28 's staid and often stuffy protocol			1
he told the thousands of youngsters , with an estimated 30,000 @entity51 registered , to get out into the streets and spread their faith , saying a church that does n't go out and preach simply becomes a civic or humanitarian group			0
' i want to tell you something			0
what is it that i expect as a consequence of @entity59 ? i want a mess			0
we knew that in @entity80 there would be great disorder , but i want trouble in the dioceses ! ' he said , speaking off the cuff in his native @entity208			2
' i want to see the church get closer to the people			0
i want to get rid of clericalism , the mundane , this closing ourselves off within ourselves , in our parishes , schools or structures			0
because these need to get out ! ' apparently realizing the radicalness of his message , he apologized in advance to the bishops at home .			0
