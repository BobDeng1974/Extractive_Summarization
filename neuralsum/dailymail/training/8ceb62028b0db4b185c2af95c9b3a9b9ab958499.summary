@entity1 midfielder @entity0 believes this current @entity3 side is ' poles apart ' from the one that finished bottom of the @entity8 two years ago			1
@entity0 spent the campaign on loan at @entity11 as @entity3 finished 15 points adrift of safety in 2013 and paid the price for a lack of cohesion on and off the field			1
@entity18 was unable to rescue the @entity19 after taking over in november that season but his side have made a positive start to their return to the top flight			1
@entity0 ( centre ) celebrates with @entity25 after the @entity1 striker 's goal against @entity28 a 2 - 0 victory over @entity28 on saturday - their third win in four games at home - saw @entity3 climb out of the bottom three for the first time since september			1
' the performances we have put in at @entity36 have been exceptional , even in defeat sometimes , ' @entity0 said			2
' the team spirit and togetherness of the football club is poles apart from that side which went out of the league with a whimper			2
' we came up and we want to give a good account of ourselves			0
slowly but surely we are doing that			0
" @entity0 continued : ' to look at the table and see yourselves not in the bottom three is always heart - warming			1
@entity0 ( centre ) gets physical with @entity52 's @entity51 ( right ) during his loan spell at @entity11 in 2013 ' hopefully at the end of may that 's the case because that will be job done and goal achieved			1
there 's a long way to go			2
this is the 15th game			2
' after the defeat at @entity64 the other day i asked our analyst to pull the table up from the year that @entity1 went down , the year i was in @entity68			2
' after 14 games we only had five points and i think it took them 16 games to win a game			1
so comparatively we 're light years ahead			0
' @entity3 ' impressive form at home is in stark contrast to their results on the road where they have lost to @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity64 this season			2
@entity18 's side are the only team in @entity91 's top four divisions yet to register a single point away from home and @entity0 admits it 's a problem that needs addressing			1
@entity18 ( left ) took up the to job at @entity1 in 2013 , but he could not save the club from relegation ' we have lost seven out of seven on the road but without making excuses , we have n't been to the easiest places , ' @entity0 said			1
' we have n't played teams in and around us			0
that will be the test for us			0
we 've been to some of the tougher places in the league			0
' i think everyone we 've played away has been in the top 10 at the time we 've played them			2
' we 're very mindful that we 've got to improve our away form			0
" @entity3 ' awaydays do not get any easier as they travel to @entity113 and @entity114 before the end of the year either side of home games against @entity118 and @entity119			2
the bottom half of the table remains congested ahead of the busy @entity123 calendar with only five points separating @entity1 in 17th and @entity125 in 11th			1
' if you string back - to - back wins together in this league you can propel yourself up the table , ' @entity0 said			1
' that 's how tight it is			0
that 's why people tune in			0
the @entity8 is so competitive			0
@entity18 , however , managed to guide @entity0 ( above ) and his @entity1 side back to the @entity8 last term ' @entity86 's " @entity138 " all of a sudden go to @entity87 , @entity87 with their eighth - choice goalkeeper or whatever - and all of a sudden he comes on and they go on and beat @entity86			1
' there 's not many other leagues where that happens			0
i 've just seen on the tv , @entity144 ( have recorded an ) 18th straight win			0
' @entity114 went unbeaten for a year but i ca n't see anyone banging 18 wins out on the spin , not in this league , not with how competitive it is			0
' there 's a different element here , which is why people tune in from all over the globe			0
' second - half goals from @entity157 and @entity25 ensured @entity3 took maximum points against @entity28 but there was disappointment too as @entity25 was sent off and will subsequently miss next monday 's match at @entity113			1
' he 's our top scorer , he 's been the difference for us at various times this season , ' @entity0 added			1
' to be without him is going to be a massive loss			0
