the big - eyed animal was born at @entity7 , @entity8 , alongside his twin sister			1
the pair are so tiny they each weigh about 25 grams - equivalent to about two tablespoons of white sugar			2
experts at zoo bred the pair of pygmy slow loris in a bid to boost the primitive species ' threatened population			1
' we are excited about our first birth of pygmy slow lorises at the @entity39 , especially because they are twins , ' said collections supervisor @entity41			1
' it ’s evident that through our staff ’s hard work and dedication , this has been a successful birth			0
' boost : the zoo bred the pair in an attempt to boost the primitive species ' threatened population light as a feather : they each weigh the equivalent to approximately two tablespoons of white sugar but visitors may have a hard time seeing them in their exhibit because they are nocturnal animals and they may be sleeping in clinging to mom , in their hammock , deep baskets or nest boxes			2
slow lorises are found in south and south - east @entity68 , including @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
they live in rainforests and mangrove forests , preferring high dense canopies they can easily travel across			0
the creatures are omnivores , eating insects , small birds and reptiles , eggs , fruits and other vegetation			0
as a defence mechanism lorises will bite aggressors , producing a toxin to infect the wounds			0
to humans the bites cause a painful swelling , but the toxin is mild and not fatal			0
the single reported case of human death by loris bite was believed to have resulted from prophylactic shock			0
excitement : collections supervisor @entity41 said : ' we are excited about our first birth of pygmy slow lorises at the @entity39 , especially because they are twins ' hidden : visitors may have a hard time seeing them in their exhibit because they are nocturnal animals and they may be sleeping in clinging to mom , in their hammock , deep baskets or nest boxes taking a nap : the tiny animal hangs on a branch as it takes a rest			1

experts at the @entity7 managed to *safely* breed the pair
population of slow lorises has *declined* over the years
the twin baby lorises have not yet been named
