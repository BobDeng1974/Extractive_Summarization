a roman catholic school attended by @entity2 ’s eldest son and two of @entity4 ’s has been cleared of discriminating against the poor			1
the @entity6 criticised the @entity7 in @entity8 for engaging in ‘ social selection ’ , saying it had broken the rules in 105 different ways			1
the state - funded school in @entity14 , @entity8 , was ordered to revise its admissions policy last year after the watchdog decided it was biased against working - class and @entity19 children			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 was cleared of discriminating against the poor and @entity19 children the watchdog accused the school of cherry - picking privileged white children using its strict faith - based entry requirements			1
but yesterday , this was overturned by a high court judge who said this decision was ‘ flawed ’ and ‘ unreasonable ’			1
mr @entity30 said : ‘ the adjudicator ’s conclusion that the governing body of the school had operated an admissions system which was socially selective , discriminatory , and unfairly disadvantageous to children from less well - off families was flawed and was reached by a process which was procedurally unfair to the school			1
’ the original case followed a complaint by the @entity42 in the spring of 2013			0
the school , founded in 1863 , has prioritised pupils based on whether they sing in the choir , arrange flowers in church , serve at the altar or assist in pastoral work			0
in its ruling , the watchdog said the school must not grant places ‘ on the basis of any practical or financial support parents may give to the school ’ - nor should children be favoured on the basis of their hobbies and activities			1
it said the ratio of children receiving free school meals - used as an indicator of poverty - was only 6 - 7 per cent compared with the local average of 25.1 per cent			0
mr @entity2 ’s eldest son @entity68 , 12 , attends , while mr @entity4 sent his two eldest sons , @entity70 and @entity71 , to the school with daughter @entity73 believed to have joined in the sixth form			0
the boys ’ school , which admits girls to the sixth form , also counts deputy labour leader @entity79 among its alumni			0
a high court judge branded the decision by the watchdog ' flawed ' it is one of the most popular in the country and is always oversubscribed			1
in a reserved judgment after a hearing last month mr @entity30 ordered the adjudicator to think again after remitting the case to be heard by a fresh adjudicator			1
he said : ‘ i am satisfied that the adjudicator reaches this conclusion by a mix of flawed reasoning and unfair process			1
in the circumstances i am satisfied that this finding must be quashed			0
’ he ordered the adjudicator to pay 80 per cent of the school ’s £ 155,000 costs with £ 60,000 on account			2
@entity101 , solicitor for the school , said : ‘ the allegation that the school was socially selective and discriminating against less well - off families has been hurtful to staff , pupils and parents			0
‘ this damaging allegation has been found by the judge to be wrong and unfair , and the finding vindicates the robust approach the school has had to take against the @entity6			2
’ headmaster @entity114 added : ‘ the judge ’s decision supports us in continuing to preserve the school ’s ethos and serving @entity121 families throughout the whole of @entity8			2
‘ it is profoundly regrettable that the school - and other schools - have to expend precious resources , year after year , in standing up to the @entity6			2
‘ these are key resources that should go to our children ’s education and their future , not overturning ultimately flawed and unmeritorious decisions			2
schools within the state sector have serious questions to ask about the adjudication process			0
’ the judge said he feared his conclusions would not bring an end to investigations into the school which had been going on for ‘ far too long			0
’ @entity143 was rated ‘ outstanding ’ by @entity144 and has some of the best results in the country			0
the case comes after a group of secular vicars and laypeople wrote an open letter calling for all @entity153 schools to stop admissions based on faith criteria			2
church groups have complained that a ‘ secular agenda ’ is increasingly being imposed on faith schools which aim to uphold their traditional beliefs .			0

came after watchdog found it was biased against poor and *non-catholics*
@entity166 overturned decision of @entity168 of the @entity169
