one in five people carry a ' smart gene ' variant linked to long lifespan , bigger forebrains and enhanced mental ability , researchers have found			1
scientists found people who carry the gene have larger volumes in a front part of the brain involved in planning and decision - making			2
they say the find could have major implications for sufferers of @entity17 's and other forms of dementia			2
the @entity27 gene codes for a protein found in the kidney and brain that regulates many different body processes			2
about one in five people carry a single copy of the variant , known as @entity34 , that boosts levels of the protein and is associated with longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function			1
a small minority , 3 % of the population , has two copies , which is linked to a shorter lifespan			1
it follows the previous discovery that middle - aged and older people who have a single copy of the gene variant performed better in a wide range of mental tests			1
' we 've known for a long time that people lose cognitive abilities as they age , but now we 're beginning to understand that factors like klotho can give people a boost and confer resilience in aging , ' said senior author @entity59 of @entity60			2
' genetic variation in @entity27 could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the devastating diseases that happen to us as we grow old , like @entity17 's and other dementias			2
' the @entity27 gene codes for a protein found in the kidney and brain that regulates many different body processes			2
about one in five people carry a single copy of the variant , known as @entity34 , that boosts levels of the protein and is associated with longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function			1

in the new study scientists scanned the brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and over who were also tested for the @entity27 gene			0
they found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( @entity91 ) , which is especially susceptible to shrinkage with age			1
loss of neurons in this area may be one reason why older people are sometimes easily distracted and find it difficult to multitask			0
the size of the @entity91 predicted how well the study volunteers performed in tests such as working memory - the ability to hold onto newly acquired information - and processing speed			0
the results appear in the journal @entity108			0
@entity110 researcher dr @entity109 , from the @entity60 , said : ' the brain region enhanced by genetic variation in @entity27 is vulnerable in ageing and several psychiatric and neurologic diseases including schizophrenia , depression , substance abuse , and frontotemporal dementia			0
' in this case , bigger size means better function			0
' it will be important to determine whether the structural boost associated with carrying one copy of @entity34 can offset the cognitive deficits caused by disease			1
' a previous study , funded by the @entity110 - based @entity128 , found the protein boosts brain skills such as thinking , learning and memory			0
it is believed it could increase the strength of connections between nerve cells in the brain			0
' our results suggest klotho may increase the brain 's capacity to perform everyday intellectual tasks , ' said coauthor @entity145 , professor of neuroscience at the @entity60			0
people who have one copy of a variant , or form , of the kloto gene , called @entity34 , tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a higher risk of stroke			1
as part of the study , researchers genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein in the study , researchers found that people who had one copy of the @entity34 variant performed better on a battery of cognitive tests than subjects who did not have it , regardless of age , sex or the presence of the apolipoprotein 4 gene , the main genetic risk factor for @entity17 's disease			1
researchers also genetically engineered mice to overproduce klotho protein			0
the klotho - enhanced mice lived longer and had higher levels of klotho in the blood and in a brain area known as the hippocampus , which controls some types of learning and memory .			0
