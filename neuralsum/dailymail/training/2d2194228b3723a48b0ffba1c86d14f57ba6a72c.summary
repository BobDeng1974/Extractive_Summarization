when @entity1 took to the stage in the first live x factor show on saturday , it was n't just her performance that impressed			1
she also drew admiration for her defined abs , with judge @entity8 complimenting the singer for her toned muscles during her appraisal			1
so what 's the secret to @entity15 's enviable figure ? abs factor : @entity15 revealed her toned tummy as she performed on on the first live show the 26 - year - old from @entity20 told @entity21 that there are no quick fixes - it 's all down to exercising regularly and eating well			1
she said : ' i normally hit the gym five times a week			1
i tend to do half an hour of cardio – on the treadmill or a spin class – then head for the weights			2
i do a lot of core work , obviously ! ' core work refers to exercises to strengthen the core muscles around the abdomen			2
these act like a corset , pulling the stomach in and improving posture			0
exercises @entity15 said she does to strengthen her core include the plank - which she boosts she can hold for two minutes			1
works out : the singer does exercises like the plank and mountain climbers to get her flat stomach appreciation : the judges were impressed with @entity15 's performance as well as her figure beginners should start by trying to hold the position for 30 seconds			1
it involves lying face down on the floor , positioning your arms under your shoulders , and then lifting your body up so you 're balanced on your toes and forearms			0
the stomach should be held it and beginners may be feel wobbly - it 's certainly a move that 's harder than it looks			2
variations include doing the plank side on , balancing on one forearm and the outside of the foot			0
personal trainer and author of the @entity75 told @entity76 that @entity15 is wise to do the plank for a toned tummy			1
she said : ' the plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body , including the deep abdominal muscles			1
it is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises			0
' now @entity15 is strong enough to hold the position for two minutes , @entity90 recommends she takes it further by adding some movement			1
keeps fit : @entity15 said she 's always loved exercising and is making the most of the gym in @entity98 house healthy eater : the singer snacks on fruit and nuts when rehearsing she explains : ' i 'm a big fan of adding movement to planks once you 're able to hold the position with good form , adding motion does much more to strengthen and shape the abdominal area than simply staying in the pose for ever longer periods of time , so i get clients to raise alternate arms and legs or doing things like palm - to - elbow planks where then alternate between having their hands and elbows on the mat. ' other moves @entity15 does to get her toned stomach include mountain climbers and press - ups			1
speaking of the latter , she told the magazine : ' yes , they 're an upper body move but your core 's engaged all the way through			0
she said : ' press ups are an awesome all - body move , again you 're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position , which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you 're sculpting the chest and arms			0
' mountain climbers involves bending down on the floor with the hands down and arms straight and then moving your legs in a running motion bringing alternative knees up to the chest and straightening the leg again			0
' @entity152 climbers are fantastic exercise , offering a total body workout in single “ do anywhere ” move			0
the core is activated to keep the body in position while you power the legs out behind you			0
they are hardcore , but if you want to burn body fat these will definitely get you ignited ! ' @entity90 said			0
@entity15 is n't afraid to lift weights or use exercise machines at the gym			1
her figure proves doing so achieves a slim , muscular figure - not one of a bulky body builder which some women fear they will get if they lift weights			2
the @entity98 finalist , who is mentored by @entity173 , said she uses the leg press machine and does squats with a barbell			1
@entity90 said this is a great move : ' squats are among the best exercises you can do to firm up and sculpt the legs and bum and they also work the core and back muscles			0
using a loaded barbell for these is an excellent idea once you 've cracked the right technique because they fire up some large muscles which makes them great for fat burning - and no one wants their ripped abs hiding under a layer of flab			0
' for @entity15 , exercise is a pleasure and not a chore			2
she said : ' i 've always loved working out			0
when i was little my dad used to make me and my sister do 10 press - ups every day , before we brushed our teeth in the morning			0
it was like a boot camp ! then i did a lot of athletics at school , and was a dancer			0
' she added that she eats healthily rather than following a strict diet			1
she 'll opt for brown bread and rice other white varieties because they have a lower @entity219 and avoids fizzy drinks and sweets			0
for a snack to keep her energy up when rehearsing , she favours fresh fruit and mixed nuts			1
she admitted sticking to her rule of ' everything in moderation ' can be difficult now she 's currently outside her usual routine			2
' there 's a lot of temptation in the @entity98 house , ' she said			1
' all the girls have a sweet tooth – they love sweets and chocolate			0
so i 'm trying to convert people ! ' but she revealed the finalists are all being encouraged to take care of themselves thanks to an in - house chef who cooks healthy meals and a gym within their plush shared mansion			1
after an understated start to the competition - where she fared to stand out hugely from the crowd in the audition and boot camp stages - @entity15 impressed @entity173 at the judges ' houses stage seeing her through to the live shows			2
after her performance on saturday , she 's now tipped to go far , so we 'll be seeing a lot more of those abs.			2
