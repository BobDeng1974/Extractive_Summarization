' a @entity11 looked over the trench - no shots - our men did the same , and then a few of our men went out and brought the dead in ( 69 ) and buried them and the next thing happened a football kicked out of our trenches and @entity11 and @entity53 played football			1
' @entity55 came and still no shots			2
boxing day the same , and has remained so up to now ... optimistic : @entity14 details how things were ' looking rosy ' after some of the @entity11 had given themselves up as prisoners family : @entity34 , left , found the poignant letter , which describes the truce in detail , from his uncle while going through documents following the death of his mother date : @entity14 wrote the letter on december 29 , 1914 , after the @entity10 and @entity11 troops had conversed during the truce ' we have conversed with the @entity11 and they all seem to be very much fed up and heaps of them are deserting			1
' some have given themselves up as prisoners , so things are looking quite rosy			0

he is talking about clearing away bodies one moment and then a game of football the next			0
' after 1914 there was gas and aerial bombardments and it got pretty nasty			2
' it 's a famous event so it was a surprise to find out somebody from my family had such a close connection to it			2
' at the time it was all hushed up because our troops were n't supposed to fraternize with the enemy			0
' it 's an interesting insight and shows that the @entity11 troops in particular were pretty fed up even though the war was only three months old at this stage			1
' cease - fire : @entity11 and @entity10 troops meet in @entity19 during the @entity147 the letter was featured on a recent episode of the @entity151 's @entity150			1
