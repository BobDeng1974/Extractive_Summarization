by @entity0 over-the - counter divorces will make ending a marriage as easy as ' disposing of a carrier bag ' , a former government minister has warned			1
@entity5 said plans under consideration by the most senior family law judge in @entity10 and @entity11 , sir @entity6 will make obtaining a divorce even easier than it is at present			1
this comes as the @entity15 has revealed that the number of couples divorcing has increased by 0.5 percent between 2011 and 2012			0
@entity5 , left , believes plans under consideration by sir @entity6 , right would be ' making an nonsense of marriage ' and ' should not be like buying sweets over the counter , or discarding an old carrier bag ' couples have to be married for at least a year before they can apply for a divorce in @entity10 and @entity11			1
a so - called ' quickie divorce ' can be granted in @entity10 and @entity11 within six months in the case of adultery or unreasonable behaviour			1
however , if there are complicated financial issues or a dispute over child care arrangements , the process can take several years			0
in all cases , one party has to apply to court for a decree nisi citing one of five grounds for the divorce			1
once the decree nisi is granted under one of the five grounds , a decree absolute , ending the marriage officially can be issued after six weeks			2
ms @entity5 told @entity49 : ' divorce is already too easy — it makes a nonsense of marriage			1
i am not saying , go back to the old days when divorce involved tricks and stratagems , but at least it should be something people have to think about and take a great deal of trouble over			0
' it should not be like buying sweets over the counter , or discarding an old carrier bag			1
' the number of divorces has fallen from a high of 153,000 in 2003 , although this could be due to a reduction in the number of people getting married			0
at the outbreak of the @entity73 , 450,000 people a year were getting married compared with 250,000 in 2012			0
in @entity10 and @entity11 , married couples can apply for a divorce if they have been married for at least twelve months and accept that the relationship has permanently broken down			0
the marriage has to be legally recognised in the @entity79 and the couple must have a permanent home in @entity10 and @entity11			0
at present , a divorce petition has to be filed with the court showing the reason for the marriage to end			1
if the spouse agrees to the petition , the court will grant a decree nisi , showing there is no reason why a divorce can not be granted			2
six weeks later , the marriage can be ended with the granting of a decree absolute			0
according to the @entity15 , 13 divorces an hour were granted in 2012 with almost half of these happening within the first decade of marriage			2
women were granted 65 per cent of all divorces and only one in seven was due to adultery			0
almost half of those divorcing had at least one child aged under 16 living with the family while the most likely time for a split is between the fourth and eighth wedding anniversary			0
according to current figures , 42 per cent of all marriages will end in divorce			0
from 2015 , the @entity15 will also release figures on the first same - sex divorces			2
more than 40 per cent of all marriages will end in divorce with couples between four and eight years married at the greatest risk however , sir @entity6 wants to streamline the process , removing uncontested divorces from the court system			1
he said : ‘ there are countries where the system is that a divorce which is by consent and where there are no children is treated as an administrative matter dealt with by what , using our terminology , one might describe as the registrar of births , deaths , marriages and divorces			1
’ he said he ‘ would not contemplate it in cases other than cases where there is consent and cases where there are no children of the family ’			0
sir @entity6 added : ‘ all one is doing is actually bringing a bit of intellectual honesty to the situation and getting rid of an unnecessary process which simply makes life more complicated			1
’ any changes to divorce law would need parliamentary legislation to be drawn up and pushed through by the justice secretary			0
ministers have indicated that present justice secretary @entity157 will not consider divorce reform before the election			2
@entity160 , partner at @entity161 said : ' sir @entity6 has stirred up debate in the media by advocating the introduction of new “ no - fault ” divorces which would n’t be dealt with by the courts , but rather by @entity167 as an administrative exercise similar to the registration of births , marriages and deaths			1
' unusually perhaps for a member of the legal profession , i would cautiously welcome sir @entity6 ’ suggested reforms for people who want to divorce by mutual consent			1
by taking uncontested divorces out of the court system , it could be a faster and cheaper way to bring marriages to an end and may avoid some of the acrimony that sometimes results from court proceedings			2
' sir @entity6 ’ suggestions do not appear to propose changes to the current rules which provide for compulsory mediation in divorces involving financial or child related issues			1
in those circumstances , for people without the benefit of the right legal advice , there is a danger that the dominant partner in the marriage could try to manipulate the mediation process to their own advantage			0
' the @entity15 will release the first figures on same - sex divorces from 2015			2

@entity209 judge *supremo* wants to remove no - contest divorce form court
sir @entity6 said these divorces should be ' an administrative matter '
@entity5 said the plan will ' make a nonsense of marriage '
she said divorce ' should not be like buying sweets over the counter '
