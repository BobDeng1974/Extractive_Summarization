but it 's fair to say this fascinating modern design of a hotel bar , using sections of giant concrete drainage pipes , has a touch of glamour and even allure about it			1
@entity12 have transformed this once fairly ordinary bar into a work of art by creating an innovative extension made almost entirely from 17 concrete water pipes that now dominate the striking street facade			1
work of art : this imaginative facelift of a bar in @entity22 , @entity23 , using concrete drainage pipes is undoubtedly intriguing style : @entity12 has kitted out many of the giant pipes with leather - clad seating and wood - paneled interior , transforming the draining pipes into stylish drinking booths improvement : the grand , statement extension has increased the drinking area of the @entity35 in @entity22 from 130m2 to 300m2 over three levels the clever rethinking of the space has effectively turned the 130m2 back area of @entity40 in @entity22 into 300m2 over three levels for architect @entity43 , the pipes add a lot more than drama to the hotel 's exterior , adding an element of challenge for pie - eyed clientele			1
' inside you are climbing over the pipes , sitting in them , or on them at various levels			2

' we were looking for a sense of drama and theatricality			1
' the inescapable concrete pipes play an integral role in the design of the building , inside and out drama : the aim , said the architects , was create a space with a sense of drama and theatre where the enormous pipes are n't seating the bar 's clientele , they are used as vast plant pots , among other things booths can be seen from the street , and throughout the interior of the hotel			1
each booth , that seats up to 12 , features leather upholstered banquettes and is lined with recycled spotted gum slats and acoustic absorption mats			0
at its core , design ' is about conviviality ' says @entity91			0
' it 's providing people with opportunities to interact in non-standard ways , a whole variety of seating and gathering			0
' to make sure there is space for serious partying , one long table on the ground floor can be dismantled to make way for an impromptu dance floor			0
taking the rough with the smooth : @entity106 , leather , stone , and ... concrete drainage pipes , create an alluring and intimate drinking booth in this vast hotel bar further water piping has been used to decorate other elements of this intriguing bar @entity91 made sure the redesign featured a serious @entity117 deck			2
