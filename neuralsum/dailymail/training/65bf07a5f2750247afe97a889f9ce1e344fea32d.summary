sold to @entity17 ... in a hood near you ! ' read the tagline on @entity4 's @entity4 page , pictured chaos : one tweet claimed the ceo of @entity27 was a pot smoker and linked to this photo , pictured it said he sent out numerous tweets referencing ' @entity71 , ' many of which were targeted at his friends			1
but he reportedly revealed his identity when @entity71 bragged about his feat to a girl using his real name on @entity79 , which had the incriminating url of @entity79 / ithug			0
it has now been deleted			0
@entity82 , the @entity83 - based agency that manages @entity4 and other social media accounts for most of @entity5 's brands in @entity86 , noticed the first unauthorized tweet on @entity4 's site at 1:32 p.m. et tuesday , according to @entity89 , head of @entity5 digital media			1

' the agency and the company are looking at strengthening security on the site , ' said @entity89			0
this would include stronger passwords and other measures			0

@entity4 , which industry experts say has a poor track record on online security and reliability , has over the past year begun courting big corporate sponsors , hoping to beef up its revenue stream as it competes for web surfers with @entity138 and @entity79 industry analysts have urged the company for years to beef up online security by adopting ' two - factor authentication ' or encrypting its website , among other measures			2

after all , how much damage can a little 140 - character message do ? ' said @entity166 , a cyber-security expert at @entity167			0
' that said , when business saw an opportunity to do business using @entity4 , that risk assessment went away and , at that point , @entity4 should have implemented a @entity174 or two - factor authentication login			0
