@entity1 's defensive crisis has become such an issue that the priority is to bring in a centre - half this january , where previously @entity5 had been focusing on a defensive midfielder			1
both positions need filling , with the injuries to @entity10 and right - back and occasional centre - half @entity11 only exacerbating weaknesses , rather than prompting this week ’s enquiries			1
but now @entity5 has to weigh up the likelihood of securing @entity18 ’s @entity17 or @entity20 ’s @entity19 this month			1
@entity17 , who would be priced at about £ 15million , seems a long shot for a move in the next two weeks			1
@entity18 have a @entity24 tie against @entity25 next month and , as captain , he is a key figure at the club			1
if he were to leave , the summer would be more logical			0
@entity18 ’s @entity17 ( right ) has been valued at about £ 15million and is a possible target for @entity1 @entity20 ’s @entity19 is another target for @entity1 and would be easier to get than @entity18 's @entity17 @entity32 's contract is up at @entity33 and the defender is being offered to @entity1 @entity5 is in the market to buy a defender and defensive midfielder in the january transfer window @entity39 would be easier to prise from @entity20 but @entity5 has to decide whether he truly wants the @entity20 defender			1
likewise @entity32 , whose contract is up at @entity33 and is being offered to @entity1			1
yet @entity1 have yet to finalise their target , and are unlikely to do so until next week			1
@entity5 , whose side face @entity44 at the @entity45 on sunday , says he is frustrated by the inaction			1
‘ we are a big attraction , but if it was easy we would do it			0
we have n’t found anyone			0
' i am not the only one working on the case			0
it ’s not a supermarket where you go in and buy a defender , it ’s a market that is very restricted			0
' players who can strengthen the best 10 teams in @entity59 , you do n’t find many and it ’s the same for everybody			0
‘ of course we have made enquiries and then you have a second handicap of who wants to sell their best players , especially a central defender , in the middle of the season			0
they say , “ ok , come back in june or july and maybe yes ”			0
’ @entity5 insists they could cope without a signing			2
‘ we can , because we have @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 , who can play centre - back , ’ he said			1
‘ but we have now lost @entity11 , who could play centre - back , and @entity77 has been out			1
if we have another injury or two we will struggle			0
’ @entity5 is now paying the price for the gamble he made at the beginning of the season			2
when the club sold @entity87 to @entity88 in august , the club calculated that they had barely used the third - choice centre - half in the squad in recent years			1
@entity5 currently has the use of centre - backs @entity73 ( pictured ) and @entity72 @entity5 insists they could cope without a signing because they have @entity72 ( centre ) and @entity97 @entity1 have @entity98 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 ( left ) as defenders with 19 - year - old @entity98 quickly identified as a possible back - up at centre - half , @entity5 reasoned that he could survive the season with the current squad			1
almost immediately that proved a misjudgment			0
@entity11 sustained a long - term ankle injury in september followed by @entity73 ’s achilles tendinitis in october , so @entity71 was called upon at right - back and @entity74 had to take over in central defence			2
ironically @entity110 , who left on a free transfer in the summer and who often played as a stand - in centre - half , is so far down the pecking order at sunday ’s opponents @entity44 that he may be dropped from the @entity24 squad to make room for new £ 28m signing @entity118			1
@entity1 sold @entity87 to @entity88 in august but could now do with the defensive cover @entity110 ( centre ) left on a free transfer in the summer for @entity44 but is not favoured @entity1 also desperately need a defensive midfielder			1
@entity124 @entity123 is not available , having signed a new deal that will take him back to @entity126 next season			0
but @entity128 , a player they have craved in that role for two years now , appears to have recovered from injury and has been playing regularly for @entity132			0
in addition , @entity132 are finally coming round to the idea of selling — his contract runs out in 2016 and the club are pressuring him to renew or leave			0
they would want £ 20m now — and with @entity132 threatened by relegation they would prefer him to go in the summer			0
@entity132 are finally coming round to the idea of selling the previously injured @entity128 @entity132 manager @entity140 previously blocked @entity128 's move to @entity25 @entity1 ’s apparent lack of strategy over the defence extends to the goalkeeping position			1
@entity146 should keep his place after last week ’s clean sheet with @entity149 , now 25 , proving both in his mistakes against @entity151 and his subsequent reaction — puffing on a cigarette in the changing rooms — that he has been slow to embrace maturity			0
@entity5 has likened dropping @entity149 to the times he replaced @entity157 with @entity158 , a decision which infuriated the @entity160			2
‘ @entity161 is a great keeper and will have a great career but he goes a little bit ( at times ) , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ i took @entity157 out like that			0
’ money is no longer a problem for @entity1			2
they have cash reserves of around £ 60m , and though only around £ 20m is set aside for this january , big spending can be expected to resume in the summer			0
the days of @entity44 simply taking their pick of @entity1 players ought to be over			2
off the pitch @entity1 can now hold their own ; the real test is whether they can do so on the pitch on sunday			2
@entity149 has found himself on the sidelines since being caught smoking in the showers at @entity180 's @entity146 ( pictured ) should keep his place after last week ’s clean sheet ahead of goalkeeper @entity149			2

@entity5 has not found his centre - half target yet for january
the @entity1 manager knows his priority is to fill that position
@entity5 has been weighing up the likelihood of securing @entity18 ’s @entity17 or @entity20 ’s @entity19 during the current window
