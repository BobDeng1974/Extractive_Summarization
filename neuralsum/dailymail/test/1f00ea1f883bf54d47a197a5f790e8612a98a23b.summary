bearing in mind he ’s a dog , @entity2 the border collie did a pretty good job yesterday of piloting a tractor across a motorway			1
to be fair , however , this probably was n’t the first thought to strike rush - hour drivers as they watched him crash through a fence and come hurtling towards them			0
like a scene from @entity15 and @entity15 , the intrepid sheepdog was at the controls when he sent the farm utility vehicle down a steep bank , on to the busy carriageway and into the central reservation barrier			2
@entity2 's owner @entity21 ( pictured ) was tending to a lamb when the sheepdog took control by nudging the controls the tractor smashed through a fence before ending up on the road			1
@entity2 was unhurt in the ordeal but the incident caused major tailbacks despite considerable damage , @entity2 escaped unhurt – but left scores of motorists wondering if they were imagining things			1
@entity36 tweeted a bizarre warning that there may be hold - ups ‘ due to a dog taking control of tractor ’ , adding : ‘ nope , not joking			2
’ appropriately , they could n’t resist the hashtag : ‘ # maycausetailbacks ’			0
observers and @entity48 commentators joined the pun fun by speculating : ‘ police investigating – so far no leads ’ ; or the inevitable : ‘ this is barking			0
’ the incident happened at junction 13 of the @entity54 , near @entity55 in @entity56			1
sheep farmer @entity21 was travelling across a field in the @entity59 farm vehicle with his companion in the passenger seat during their morning rounds			1
behind the wheel : @entity2 leaned on the controls of the tractor before driving it on to the @entity54 near @entity55 in @entity56 during rush hour the vehicle shot out of the field and crashed down a bank by the side of the road before colliding with the central reservation of the @entity54 near junction 13 northbound as shown by the red arrow moments after he got out of the vehicle , it took off with @entity2 at the wheel			1
safely back at nearby @entity80 yesterday with @entity2 at his side , mr @entity21 explained : ‘ i was sorting out one of the lambs and had n’t put the brake on			2
‘ when i turned around i saw it racing towards the motorway			0
i ran after it but i could n’t catch up			0
’ @entity36 tweeted the news that a dog had ' taken control of a tractor ' before adding , ' nope , not joking ' officers cleared the motorway within half an hour and @entity2 was reunited with his relieved owner at nearby @entity80 remarkably , drivers managed to avoid the runaway vehicle before it came to crashing halt , and none was hurt			1
nor did the black and white border collie ( a breed noted for its intelligence and obedience ) panic or flee in terror			0
‘ he did n’t even bark , ’ mr @entity21 said			2
police said @entity2 had set the vehicle in motion by inadvertently leaning on the controls			1
‘ so far people seem to find it amusing , ’ mr @entity21 said			0
‘ but i think @entity2 ’s driving days are over			0
’ @entity114 , a giant schnauzer cross , was pictured driving a mini down a race track in @entity118 in 2012			0
