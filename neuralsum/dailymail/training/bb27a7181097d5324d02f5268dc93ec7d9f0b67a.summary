the director of a video which showed a young woman being catcalled more than 100 times as she walked through the streets of @entity5 for ten hours has come under fire for the seeming racial bias of his film			1
director @entity9 filmed actress @entity10 , 24 , as she walked through busy , @entity21 streets , wearing jeans and a t - shirt , while enduring a barrage of comments like : ' what 's up , beautiful ? ' ; ' @entity16 ! ' and ' @entity17 bless you , @entity19 ... '			1
at one point , a man walks in step with her , silently , for five minutes			1
the majority of men featured in the two - minute clip are black and @entity29 , a fact which mr @entity9 addressed on thursday during a q&a session on @entity32 after the video garnered reams of media coverage			1
mr @entity9 responded : ' honestly we did have a lot of white dudes in this video , but for whatever reason it worked out that they would be the ones to say something just in passing , or from a distance off camera			1
this made their screen time fairly short by comparison , but the numbers were relatively similar			0
director @entity9 ( pictured ) has come under fire for apparent racial bias in his viral video ' as the video says at the end , it was upwards of 100 + harassments , so obviously not everything was shown , otherwise we 'd have a video that 's too long for internet attention spans			1
but really it was across the board , just about everyone said / did something while we filmed			0
' the response to the director 's remark drew heated responses			2
dr @entity91 , a psychiatrist in @entity92 , tweeted : ' @entity9 ' biased catcalling video serves to support his ongoing gentrification campaign			2
' @entity95 wrote : ' @entity9 intentionally edited out the white men from that video to demonize @entity98			1
he 's a professional gentrification proponent			0
' @entity102 tweeted : ' so this white guy , @entity9 , records a woman getting street harassment from loads of men , then cuts out most of the s * * * from white guys			1
' he also added : ' @entity110 is a rich white guy with a vested interest in portraying poor black men as the sole perpetrators of street harassment			2
' @entity115 spoke to mr @entity9 on thursday who defended his video , saying that his artistic decision to cap filming at ten hours ' showed something that was realistic but statistically inaccurate '			1
he said that although a number of white men were cut during the editing process - so were men of other races			1
the director said that the number of white men in the video - roughly six - is representative of @entity21 demographics , according to figures he quoted from @entity132			1
mr @entity9 said : ' the 18 scenes that we show is a very small portion of street harassment that goes on , because it is a small size			2
' we got 108 reactions but after editing down , the two longest incidents [ involving a black man and a @entity29 man ] make up half the video			2
' he added : ' if we filmed for a much longer time , it would show the breakdown of @entity21 and a much wider demographic			0
' the director also pointed to the fact that there were no @entity56 men in the video - not to suggest that they did n't harass women but ' that 's what 's going to happen in a short - time span '			1
mr @entity9 said he did understand why people would be angry at the perceived racial skew but added : ' on this ten hour pass through , this was what we got			1
' hollaback ! , the organization which teamed with mr @entity9 to promote the video , released a statement following the director 's comments on the racial skew today			1
in part , it read : ' first , we regret the unintended racial bias in the editing of the video that over represents men of color			2
although we appreciate @entity9 ’s support , we are committed to showing the complete picture			0
it is our hope and intention that this video will be the start of a series to demonstrate that the type of harassment we ’re concerned about is directed toward women of all races and ethnicities and conducted by an equally diverse population of men			0
' miss @entity10 was subject to 108 instances of catcalling during the filming of the video			0
in the two - minute clip , the majority of cat - callers are black and @entity29 - this individual is one of the white men included the video struck a chord this week and instantly became a viral sensation			1

the video was covered by bloggers and major news networks alike , leading to another disturbing consequence			0
miss @entity10 , who is the subject of the film , has had multiple rape threats directed towards her			0
speaking about the experience of making the video , the 24 - year - old told @entity211 : ' i felt like crying and i have occurrences in my past of sexual assault , so i was n’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me			0
' i was just going over in my head and reliving , unfortunately , these memories while i was walking			0
i wanted to break down in tears			0
' @entity221 , executive director of @entity222 ! , the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video , told the @entity225 : ' we ’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against @entity230 and we ’re pulling those down as quickly as possible , but they exist			0
' that ’s scary and i think what they ’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this			0
and both of us are saying no , we need to talk about this because if we do n’t talk about this , if we do n’t get this story out , then none of this is going to change			0
' at no point did @entity10 make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them			1
that did n't stop the comments from coming			0
when she did n't respond , one man told her : ' somebody 's acknowledging you for being beautiful			1
you should say thank you more ! ' miss @entity10 said the number of comments the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her			2
' the frequency is something alarming , ' she added			0
miss @entity10 said the number of comments on the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her living in @entity21			2

a hidden - camera clip released this week showed actress @entity10 being harassed by men on the street
she received a barrage of comments over ten hours from ' what 's up , beautiful ? ' to ' smile ! ' - and even one man walking silently beside her for five minutes
director @entity9 forced to deny clip was racially biased after he told @entity32 *fan* ' a lot of white dudes ' they had filmed did not make the final cut
he *clarified* that he edited out a lot of men from different racial *backgrounds* and the short clip was ' statistically inaccurate '
