by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:55 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 00:56 est , 18 october 2013 the family of a boy whose body was severely burned on his eighth birthday came face - to - face with the man accused of dousing him with gasoline and setting him alight on thursday , for the first time since that horror day 15 years ago			1
nearly every part of @entity13 's body was etched by fire , leaving him covered with third - degree burns outside his @entity17 home			1
in the years that followed , he endured painful skin grafts , more than 100 surgeries and constant physical therapy			1
as he grew into adolescence , he seemed to move on with his life			0
his sister said his mantra was , ' the past is the past			0
' but an important question from the past lingered : would his attacker be brought to justice ? @entity13 never learned the answer			2
he died in 2011 , shortly before his 21st birthday , from skin cancer that his family believes developed from cells in some of the skin grafts			1
authorities reopened the case and last month filed a murder charge against @entity42 , the suspect @entity13 had long accused of burning him			1
that revelation prompted authorities to reinvestigate @entity42 , a neighbor who was 13 at the time			1
if convicted , he faces up to life in prison			1
@entity42 appeared before judge @entity57 during a detention hearing in @entity60 's 359th @entity59 in @entity61 on wednesday			2
@entity62 found there was enough probable cause to hold @entity42 and ordered he be held on a $ 1 million bond			2
but pursuing a murder charge against @entity42 , now 28 , might be difficult for prosecutors , who would first have to get the case transferred from juvenile court to district court so @entity42 can be tried as an adult			1
if that hurdle is overcome , legal experts say , the greatest challenge would be convincing jurors that @entity13 's cancer resulted directly from the severe burns			1
his family and authorities argue that a hormone needed to grow some of the skin grafts helped exacerbate cancerous cells in the skin			1
' i know that they have the right person , ' said his mother , @entity87			0
hard road : @entity87 , pictured , came face - to - face with the man accused of burning her son and causing his death for the first time in 15 years @entity42 had been charged right after @entity13 was burned			1
but authorities were unable to proceed , in part because he was too severely hurt to help investigators			0
@entity60 attorney @entity97 , whose office filed the new murder charge , said the case was originally given only a ' cursory investigation , ' and @entity42 was released 6 months after his arrest			1
@entity42 was convicted of sexually assaulting a different 8 - year - old boy in 2001			2
after serving his sentence in the juvenile system , he was twice convicted as an adult of failing to register as a sex offender			0
he is jailed in nearby @entity108 on a third violation of failing to register and could get up to 10 years			0
' i had often wondered : why has this case lay dormant for 15 years ? ' @entity97 said			0
' i 've never been able to give a good answer for that			0
' after her son was burned , @entity13 said her initial focus was on finding out who was responsible			2
but doctors told @entity13 her son 's health needed to come first			2
' so we kind of had to put the whole criminal investigation on ( hold ) and just ( did ) it around @entity13 's schedule , his healing , ' she said			2
horror : nearly every part of @entity13 , pictured before , left , and after , right , was etched by fire , leaving him covered with third - degree burns outside his @entity17 home initially , doctors told @entity13 that her son would not survive the june 28 , 1998 , attack near their home in @entity137 , about 35 miles northeast of @entity138			1
that day , her son had gone over to a friend 's house when she got a call that her son had been burned			0
she ran outside and found @entity13 lying on the street , naked			0
@entity13 did n't understand why her son had no clothes on until she realized they had all been burned away			0
for the next three years or so , he spent more time hospitalized than at home			0
he was severely disfigured , lost most of his vision and had to use a wheelchair			0
eventually he was able to walk again and dress and feed himself and go back to school			0
' there was never normalcy , never , ' @entity13 said			0
by his 18th birthday , @entity13 told his family he was done with surgeries			1
the family , which was living in @entity158 at the time , looked forward to a future in which he could one day live by himself , learn to drive and become a wildlife rehabilitator			0
but in march 2010 , he was diagnosed with skin cancer			1
he died in april 2011			0
before his death , the family had hired an attorney to look into his case because @entity13 believed authorities ' were n't doing all that they could have done			1
' tragedy : @entity87 holds a photograph of her son , @entity13 , after an interview in @entity171 , @entity17 on september 26 , 2013 two weeks before his death , @entity13 gave his deposition			1
that deposition became part of a lawsuit his family filed against @entity42			1
in december 2011 , a jury returned a $ 150 billion verdict in favor of @entity13 's family			2
but the verdict was mostly symbolic			0
however , @entity13 's revelation in his deposition renewed interest in the case			2
@entity97 , who took office in january , said a 6 - month investigation gathered new evidence , including claims that @entity42 told the other 8 - year - old he was convicted of sexually assaulting that he would burn the boy just like @entity191			2
on october 21 , @entity97 is scheduled to ask that @entity42 ' murder charge be transferred to adult court			1
if a judge denies the request , that would end the case			0
@entity42 does not have an attorney for the murder charge			1
but @entity200 , his attorney on the failure - to - register charge , said he is worried that information from the murder case might make its way into the trial in @entity108 , which is set for february			1
' it 's important to remember he has never been convicted ' in the murder case , @entity200 said			0
' as such , he still has the right of presumption of innocence			0
' @entity13 , who moved with her family from @entity158 to @entity171 about a month ago to be closer to legal developments in the case , said she wondered at one point if she was selfish to ask that her son survive			1
but he told his mother he was happy he lived , and @entity13 is grateful she had 13 more years of memories with her son			2
' they were good years , ' @entity13 said			0
' i just remember the good stuff			0
