you could see 20 miles in each direction			2
' the mountain scenery through the @entity84 was breathtaking and we were lucky to see the seasons change into @entity86			0

he 's a goner "			0
' but eventually his body healed			0
he was determined to power through and his body responded			0
' at one point in @entity20 i was running along when a rattlesnake reared up , hissing and jumpy , in front of me			0
i jumped straight into the road out of fright			0
we later thought it would have been ironic if i 'd been hit by a truck after jumping out of the way of the snake			0
