dozens of workers have been given tens of thousands of pounds each to fund their move			0
figures released under the @entity10 that already three members of staff have received in excess of £ 80,000 to pay for their moves , with two getting about £ 85,000			2
the @entity1 's new @entity5 base has been operational since may 2011 , and began broadcasting from the site in september another has received £ 70,000 , with two others getting £ 67,000 and another £ 64,000 as the true individual cost of the move is laid bare			1
the @entity1 ’s offer to workers moving to @entity5 includes payments for stamp duty , estate agents fees , not to mention up to £ 3,000 a head to buy carpets and curtains			1
others have received up to £ 1,900 a month , before tax , to rent a home in the @entity34 , in a deal which lasts for up to two years , allowing them to temporarily maintain current homes			2
the corporation has even provided a house - buying scheme which sees it , through an external company , buying staff ’s properties for 85 per cent of their market value			0
the new figures , which cover the period up to mid-november , also show more than a dozen people have been given between £ 40,000 and £ 50,000 with almost 30 receiving between £ 30,000 and £ 40,000 and about 35 individuals in the £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 band			2
the figures are set to rise further as they do not even cover the remaining 250 individuals in the first phase of the move			0
@entity1 presenters @entity55 and @entity57 have decided to leave the breakfast news show rather than go with their jobs to the new @entity62 complex in @entity5			1

presenters @entity55 and @entity57 have decided to leave the breakfast news show rather than go with their jobs to the new @entity62 complex in @entity5			0
broadcasting bosses had originally earmarked £ 30million for relocation deals and believe that they will fall well within budget for this			1
nevertheless some of the large individual payments will raise questions about the controversial move and whether the attempts to make the @entity1 less @entity84 ’ are too costly			1
there is also a provision for temporary accommodation costs to be paid for up to six months and duplicate costs for gas , water and electricity and council tax can also covered for those caught in a housing chain			0
the @entity1 ’s scheme will pay for estate agent fees of up to 1.5 per cent of the sale price , and the £ 3,000 towards ‘ household goods ’ like carpets and curtains for those moving house			1
the so - called @entity103 , allows people to receive up to £ 1,900 a month for two years , if they are not in a position to fully move from their @entity107 home , such as in cases where children are taking exams			2
figures provided under the @entity10 request , cover up to mid-november , and account for almost 550 out of about 800 people that opted to make the move as part of the first phase			0
about 1,500 roles have moved from @entity107 in the initial ‘ migration ’ , other costs incurred by the @entity1 include interest payments on bank loans for the house - buying scheme and paying tax liabilities on relocation payments			1
most up to date figures show 160 people are on remote location deals and only 30 people have taken part in the @entity1 ’s house - buying scheme , with vast majority buying houses in the traditional way			1
the @entity5 base has been operational since may 2011 and began broadcasting from the site in september			0
the @entity1 says that by next month the first phase of the move will be complete			2
@entity140 human resources director @entity139 said the new figures represent a ‘ snapshot ’ at a point in time and said the corporation ’s packages had been benchmarked against other organisations			0
he said the deals were not about ‘ enrichment ’ but making sure people did not lose any money as a result of relocating their jobs .			0

@entity1 bosses believe they will fall within £ 30m budget for relocation deals
