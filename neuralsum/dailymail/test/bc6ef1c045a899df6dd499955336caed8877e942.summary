we ’ve all been there : you hear a catchy song and for days - or even weeks - on end you just ca n’t get it out of your head			0
known as an earworm or brainworm , the effect has been studied before - but its cause , and how to get rid of it , is poorly understood			0
now researchers say they have an answer ; chewing gum after hearing a catchy song will help you think about it less often			1
@entity16 scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song			1
in a study people were less likely to think about it when chewing ( stock image shown )			1
and they were a third less likely to ' hear ' it when chewing gum			1
the results suggests same technique could stop other intrusive thoughts the study was carried out by scientists at the @entity16			1
in the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘ catchy tunes ’ @entity31 by @entity32 and payphone by @entity33			0
- recent music exposure - repeated music exposure - @entity37 triggers ( eg. the word ‘ faith ’ ) - @entity41 triggers ( where sight or memory of a person is associated with a song ) - situation trigger ( eg. weddings can cause you to remember your own first dance song ) - stress - surprise - dreams - mind wandering over the next three minutes , they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum , not chewing gum or tapping their finger			1
while chewing gum , volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they were n’t chewing gum , or when they were told to tap their finger instead			2
and chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘ heard ’ the song in their minds by a third			2
the study is the first to examine the effects of chewing gum on earworms - and it suggests it could also be used to stop other unwanted or intrusive thoughts			1
‘ interfering with our own “ inner speech ” through a more sophisticated version of the gum - chewing approach may work more widely , ’ said dr @entity76 , from the @entity16 ’s @entity77 , who led the study			2
in the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘ catchy tunes ’ such as @entity31 by @entity32 and @entity80 by @entity33 ( pictured )			0
over the next three minutes , they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum , not chewing gum or tapping their finger while chewing gum , volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they were n’t chewing gum , or when they were told to tap their finger instead			0
and chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘ heard ’ the song in their minds by a third ( stock image shown ) ‘ however more research is needed to see whether this will help counter symptoms of obsessive - compulsive and similar disorders			0
’ in a previous study by the @entity16 in 2009 , it was found that almost any song can become an earworm			0
a recent poll suggested over 90 per cent of the population experience them at least once a week with 15 per cent classifying their earworms as ‘ disturbing ’ .			0
