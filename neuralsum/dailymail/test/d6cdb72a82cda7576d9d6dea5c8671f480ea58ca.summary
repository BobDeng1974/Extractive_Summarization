a number of companies — including @entity1 , @entity51 and @entity52 — have already withdrawn their sponsorships for @entity54 , a tech conference scheduled in may			1
change : @entity17 tweeted friday in response to @entity4 lawmakers saying friday morning they had amended the already - in - effect law , clarifying that no one will ' be able to discriminate against anyone at any time ' @entity17 's announcement follows one made by @entity65 ceo @entity64			1
on monday @entity64 condemned the laws , saying they were ' very dangerous ' , went against the founding principles of @entity69 , and would take the country back to the days of ' whites only ' signs in shop doorways			0
he added that , as a @entity74 , he supports religious freedom , but said : ' i was never taught , nor do i believe , that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate			2
' @entity64 , 54 , who came out as gay in october last year , made the comments in an op - ed for the @entity82			2
he wrote : ' in total , there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law			2
' on behalf of @entity65 , i 'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation			0

' @entity4 's religious freedom act says that the state and local government ' may not substantially burden a person 's right to the exercise of religion ' unless that burden is ' essential ' to furthering a government interest			1
it will be up to the courts to decide what counts as ' substantial ' , but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies			0
for example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony			0
supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states , and were actually signed into federal law by @entity161 in 1993			0
but opponents , including @entity64 , claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue the @entity4 bill forbids the state or local government from ' substantially burdening ' a person 's religious beliefs unless that burden is ' essential ' to further a ' compelling ' government interest , and is the ' least restrictive ' means of achieving that aim			1
it allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them , and if the court rules in their favor , allows reparations , including compensation payouts			0
it will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes ' substantial ' , but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it , mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate			2
