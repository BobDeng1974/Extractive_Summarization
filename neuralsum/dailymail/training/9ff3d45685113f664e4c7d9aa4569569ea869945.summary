by @entity0 published : 20:15 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 07:19 est , 8 january 2014 wearing a knitted v - neck jumper , her grey hair arranged in neat curls , she is hardly the likeliest of university students			0
yet this bespectacled 58 - year - old is @entity10 , a student at @entity11			1
and yesterday she became the surprise star of @entity13 after appearing on the @entity15 programme on monday night and helped turn the show into the most watched programme on the channel			1
starter for ten : @entity11 student @entity10 helped her team to a victorious 240 points versus @entity21 's 90 taking part in the quiz show , which is hosted by @entity24 , mrs @entity10 helped her four - strong team secure a place in the quarter final by answering general and specific knowledge questions			1
admittedly she did not get quite as many correct as some of her fellow team members			0
but that detail appeared not to matter to many of the programme ’s 3.13million , who instead fixated by her appearance			0
fans of the show celebrated having a ‘ granny ’ on the programme - despite mrs @entity10 having no grandchildren , while marvelling at her hair			2
and one wrote on @entity43 : ‘ is @entity10 the sweetest old lady of all time on @entity13 ? ’ another posted : ‘ utterly in awe of @entity10 ’s hair , ’ while a third appeared to gleefully state : ‘ there is actually a granny on @entity13			0
’ mrs @entity10 , who lives in @entity52 with her husband of 35 years , @entity51 , 66 , has two children - @entity55 and @entity56 - both of whom have grown up and left home			0
and no doubt her empty nest will have played some part in mrs @entity10 ’s decision to enrol at @entity11 , where she is reading for a @entity62 in @entity63			2
to anyone watching @entity66 , which was aired at 8pm on monday night , it will have been clear that mrs @entity10 was the eldest - as well as the only female - on her team			2
success : the episode , presented as ever by @entity24 , was the most watched @entity15 show on monday yet the other contestants were also older than might be expected of university students and the @entity11 team had an average age of 34			1
their rivals , from @entity76 , had an average age of 26			0
@entity21 scored 90 points , while @entity11 won 240 , securing themselves a place in the quarter final			1
last night a spokesperson for @entity15 said the channel was unable to comment on the ages of @entity13 contestants due to data protection guidelines			0
she added that the episode was the most watched programme on the channel for monday .			1

@entity10 is studying @entity90 at @entity11 in @entity91
she helped her male teammates to 240 victorious points over @entity21 's 90
