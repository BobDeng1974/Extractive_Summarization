friends and allies of @entity2 expressed ' surprise and disappointment ' last night as it emerged president @entity5 is not planning to send any serving member of his administration to her funeral			1
@entity10 sources have revealed that the @entity12 delegation at tomorrow 's service in @entity14 will be led by two @entity16 era secretaries of state : @entity18 and @entity19			1
though president @entity5 himself had not been expected to attend , there had been speculation that he would be represented either by vice president @entity23 or wife @entity24			1
other world leaders , including @entity47 's @entity46 , @entity48 of @entity49 and @entity51 prime minister @entity50 , are attending the service in person			1
a key @entity16 - era ally of @entity2 , former @entity12 secretary of state @entity19 , will attend president @entity5 paid tribute to @entity2 's towering achievements when her death was announced last week			1
but a @entity12 embassy spokesman confirmed that no serving member of his administration would be present to pay their last respects , citing a busy week in @entity12 domestic politics			2
former @entity12 vice president @entity65 and ex-secretary of state @entity67 will attend the funeral , @entity64 said today			1
former defence secretary dr @entity70 , @entity2 's closest ally in modern - day politics , said : ' i think it would be both surprising and disappointing if after president @entity5 's fulsome tribute to @entity2 , the @entity12 administration did not send a senior serving member to represent them			1
' sir @entity79 , chairman of the @entity80 of mps and peers , said : ' the bonds forged between the @entity42 and the @entity12 through @entity16 and @entity2 was instrumental in ending the @entity84 and liberating millions of people			1
' that the present administration feels unable to be represented as the world marks the extraordinary contribution @entity2 made will be a source of disappointment to those who served with her in that great endeavour			1
' the @entity12 embassy insisted no snub was intended , but confirmed that mr @entity18 and mr @entity96 would represent the @entity12			0
' this is a hugely significant week in terms of @entity12 domestic politics , ' a spokesman added			0
he said that both the @entity101 and the vice president were ' the president 's point people on gun control ' , adding : ' this is a week when there is a lot of movement on @entity110 on gun control issues			2
' last night police in @entity113 were under pressure to crack down on plans to insult the memory of @entity2 at the funeral			2
hundreds of protesters have pledged to turn their backs as her coffin travels through @entity113			0
campaigners said @entity123 had effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law and will not provoke arrests			0
the insult is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police			0
it will be seen by millions worldwide as the occasion is beamed live around the world on tv			2
family : @entity138 will be joined by his wife @entity139 and his children @entity141 and @entity142 at the funeral on wednesday saying goodbye : @entity138 and his wife @entity139 at @entity145 with his children @entity141 and @entity142 as final preparations were made for the funeral in 2003 : former prime minister @entity2 is comforted by her grandson @entity148 and granddaughter @entity142 outside the memorial service of her late husband , sir @entity151 @entity152 stages : @entity154 's twin children @entity138 and @entity155 were preparing for their mother ’s ceremonial funeral at her @entity113 home yesterday , just hours after the trial run police chiefs said they are ' not there to uphold respect ' and said demonstrators who are merely ' insulting ' are unlikely to face arrest			1
but they faced a backlash from many who questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead stateswoman			0
hundreds have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege			0
they want to occupy high - profile points of @entity2 's three - mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed			1
@entity176 , the architect behind the back - turning protest , said the public nature of the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures			2
he said : ' simply saying it is beastly , horrible or distasteful – a point of view that i can understand – does not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate			0
' retired chief constable dr @entity190 said police are forced to tread the line between the right to protest and upholding the law			0
he said on @entity195 that police will be ' very firm ' if protest becomes disruption , for example if objects are thrown at the funeral procession			0
former @entity202 chairman @entity201 described protesters as ' mindless bigots ' but said police can not intervene if they obey the law			0
@entity70 ( left ) expressed surprise that no key serving members of the @entity5 administration would pay their respects			1
former secretary of state @entity18 ( right ) will also attend the funeral with @entity19 by @entity211 she was always so particular about detail , passionate about getting things right			1
so in the semi-darkness of pre-dawn @entity113 yesterday , through virtually deserted streets , they counted the exact number of steps it will take to carry @entity2 to her funeral service , and timed her journey to the second			1
in a full and detailed rehearsal , each man , woman and horse involved in the last stage of the procession enacted the role they will play tomorrow			0
it created the bizarre but often stirring spectacle of military marching bands playing to no one , bearskin guardsmen with no crowds to flank – even a minister saying a prayer over an empty coffin			0
this was the last chance any of them had to practise for the real thing – the largest funeral in @entity42 since that of the @entity249 in 2002			0
ceremony : the funeral will be the biggest @entity42 has seen in many years , costing around £ 10million the coffin is taken up the steps of the cathedral at dawn as the services want no mistakes on wednesday journey : the coffin is show here on the gun carriage as it heads towards @entity14 's sombre : this is the path the flag draped coffin of @entity2 will follow later this week salute : @entity2 's coffin will be carried on a gun carriage though the @entity269 to @entity14 where a funeral service will be held on april 17 beneath grey skies , and then into the sunrise , a ten - strong bearer party carried and escorted a flag - draped , weighted coffin from @entity276 , the @entity278 church on @entity279			1
tomorrow this is where the coffin bearing @entity2 will be transferred to a horse - drawn gun carriage after its journey by hearse from @entity286			1
from here , along @entity289 and across @entity290 , it will be taken to @entity14 for the funeral service			0
in a salute to @entity2 's celebrated legacy , the pall - bearers were selected from soldiers , sailors and airmen closely associated with the @entity298			1
a single bell tolled as they set off for @entity14 's			2
they then moved along the route to the strains of @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity307 funeral marches			0
on the day , thousands are expected to line the streets			0
pressure : more than 700 members of the services will take part in the funeral procession pomp : the honour guard from the three military services , from regiments linked to the @entity298 , carry the coffin funeral : the coffin will be taken from @entity276 , pictured this morning , to @entity14 's , by gun carriage waiting : @entity2 's coffin is shown here on the aisle of @entity276 yesterday only a scattering of early - morning spectators got a preview of the event , involving nearly 800 servicemen and women			1
the rehearsal finished before most commuters had even begun their journey			0
in the interests of military precision , a final calculation confirmed that the procession would have to walk at 70 steps a minute over a journey of some 1,200 yards , as well as allowing time for choreographed pauses			0
it was clearly a useful fine - tuning exercise – the coffin is reported to have arrived three minutes and 15 seconds over schedule			2
major @entity345 , who has the job of organising it all , said the rehearsal was vital to allow those taking part ' to get a feel for how it 's going to go so they can perform their duties with confidence on the day '			2
and , of course , to do @entity2 proud			2
poised : as the coffin heads towards @entity14 's , men and women wait outside the cathedral for the procession to reach them rehearsal : a section of the members of the @entity366 line the steps of @entity14 in the dark military : as darkness surrounds @entity14 's , the armed forces practice their march up the steps and along by the pillars as they prepare for the funeral on wednesday procession : all the men and women taking a role in wednesday 's funeral were out in force			2

president @entity5 made decision not to send a member of his administration before yesterday 's bombings in @entity28
instead , @entity16 's former secretary of state @entity19 , a key ally of @entity2 , will attend
leaders from all over the world will be in attendance at the large - scale commemoration on wednesday
