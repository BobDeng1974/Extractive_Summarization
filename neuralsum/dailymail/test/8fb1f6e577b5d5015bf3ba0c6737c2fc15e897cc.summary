it has been at the root of division and persecution for centuries , but it seems that the white skin of most modern @entity6 did not evolve in @entity7 at all			2
now genetic research has revealed that ancient @entity10 populations were dark skinned for far longer than had originally been thought			0
rather than lightening as early humans migrated north from @entity13 around 40,000 years ago due to lower levels of sunlight , these first homo sapiens retained their dark skin colour			1
it was not until 7,800 years ago , when the first farmers migrated from the @entity33 through @entity34 that two key genes that provide lighter skin appeared			1
dna analysis obtained from ancient human remains has shown that as these farmers bred with the dark skinned hunter gatherers , one of these genes became prevalent in the @entity10 population and @entity10 's skin colour began to lighten			2
around 5,800 years ago the second gene , which makes skin colour lighter still , also began to spread though the @entity10 population			2
the first @entity6 looked dramatically different to most of the fair skinned people that live there today			0
new research suggests @entity52 were a recent addition to the area , arriving on the continent 8,000 years ago @entity6 had dark skin for far longer than previously though			1
photographed are two participants in the @entity58 's @entity57 where members of the @entity61 public spent several days dressed with a different skin colour the research , which was presented at the 84th annual meeting of the @entity65 , shows that populations in @entity7 were still evolving until relatively recently			0
it also shows that a population of hunter gatherers living on the site of @entity71 , southern @entity72 , had already developed both skin - lightening genes around 7,700 years ago together with a third that gave them blue eyes			1
dr @entity77 , a geneticist at @entity26 in @entity78 who led the work , said : ' @entity80 makes it possible to examine populations as they were before , during and after adaptation events , and thus to reveal the tempo and mode of selection			0
a study of ancient human bones has revealed how @entity6 had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming			0
it took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose , the natural sugar in mammalian milk , scientists suggests			0
researchers looked at ancient dna extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the @entity103 - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in @entity10 prehistory			0
the samples were dated from 5,700 bc to 800 @entity108 , ranging across the @entity109			0
' our findings show progression towards lighter skin pigmentation as hunter and gatherers and non-local farmers intermarried , but surprisingly no presence of increased lactose persistence or tolerance to lactose , ' said professor @entity121 , from @entity123 's @entity122			2
' this means that these ancient @entity6 would have had domesticated animals like cows , goats and sheep , but they would not yet have genetically developed a tolerance for drinking large quantities of milk from mammals			0
' ' we find a surprise in seven @entity135 hunter - gatherers from the @entity71 site in southern @entity72 who lived around 7,700 years before present			1
' while the western hunter - gatherers of central and southern @entity7 largely have the ancestral allele at the two major @entity10 skin pigmentation loci , the closely related @entity135 hunter - gatherers have both the derived alleles contributing to light skin pigmentation at high frequency			1
' the study , which is also published on the open access site @entity147 , compared the genomes obtained from the remains of 83 people found at archaeological sites across @entity7 along with the genomes of modern @entity6			1
the researchers found five genes associated with changes in diet , body size and skin pigmentation that underwent natural selection in the past 8,000 years			1
studies suggest that @entity7 was first reshaped during the @entity161 8,500 years ago			2
farmers at this time travelled north , bringing new technology and language into @entity7			0
pictured is an early @entity168 35 - 40 year old male from , @entity169 , who was part of the first mass migration to @entity7 two of the genes were associated with producing light skin - @entity174 and @entity176			1
they found that the remains of early hunter gatherers who lived in @entity29 , @entity180 and @entity181 around 8,500 years ago , they lacked these key gene variants			1
however , in the remains of hunter gatherers that had lived in @entity71 7,700 years ago , they carried both variants of @entity174 and @entity176 that produced lighter skin			1
they also carried another gene known to produce blue eyes in @entity6			0
surprisingly they found a fourth set of genes in the @entity80 from these people suggests these people may actually have been related to people living in @entity196 at the time			0
dr @entity77 and his colleagues also found that when the first farmers from the @entity33 arrived in @entity7 , they carried with them genes for light skin			1
at this time the @entity174 gene quickly became prevalent in southern and central @entity10 populations and then around 5,800 years ago			2
previous research has identified a mass migration of @entity208 populations ( @entity210 culture ) which went from the @entity212 steppes to the centre of @entity7 4,500 years ago			2
previously , researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the @entity33 , now modern day @entity34 , brought it to @entity7 these gene is known to account for between 25 - 40 per cent of the skin tone lightening in @entity6			1
around 5,800 years ago the gene variant for @entity220 then becomes prevalent , lightening skin colour further			2
the results contradict the traditional view that lower sunlight levels in @entity7 would have favoured lighter skin			0
the study also showed that around around 4,800 years ago a group of herders known as the @entity210 migrated from the stepps between the @entity230 and the @entity231 , carried with them genes for tallness to northern and central @entity7			1
professor @entity234 , a leading anthropologist at the @entity235 in @entity236 , said : ' this research adds yet more surprises to the remarkable complexity of population relationships in prehistoric @entity7 being uncovered through ancient dna			0
' archaeologists had thought that @entity7 showed a relatively simple succession from hunter - gatherers in the @entity245 to early farmers in the @entity168 , with the basic assumption that the arrival of farming significantly altered the biology of those first farmers , after which they gradually developed into the @entity6 of today			1
' but from ancient dna it now looks like the first farmers in mainland @entity7 were still relatively dark - skinned and dark - eyed , and lacked the ability to digest milk properly until only about 4,000 years ago , while contemporary hunter - gatherers in @entity135 may have been lighter - skinned but with a surprising frequency of a gene found in oriental populations today , suggesting they would have resembled them in hair form and the distinctive morphology of their front teeth			1
' ongoing selection , for poorly understood reasons , seems to have maintained large stature in northern @entity7 after the arrival of farming , while progressively reducing it in southern @entity7 , especially @entity269			0
' dr @entity270 , a paleoanthropologist at @entity271 who was not involved in the research , told the journal @entity274 : ' what we thought was a fairly simple picture of the emergence of de-pigmented skin in @entity7 is an exciting patchwork of selection as populations disperse into northern latitudes			0
' this data is fun because it shows how much recent evolution has taken place			0

the original migrants to @entity7 from @entity13 arrived 40,000 years ago
up until 8,000 years ago , early hunter - gatherers largely had darker skin
when @entity33 farmers arrived , they carried with them light skin genes
genomes of 83 people found 5 genes linked with diet and skin changes
