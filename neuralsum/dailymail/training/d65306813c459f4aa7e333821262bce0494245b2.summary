residents have been left baffled and bemused after contractors botched a painting job by marking out a parking bay around a signpost			1
a photograph taken by a surprised resident shows the new parking bay in @entity8 , east @entity9 , marked out with white paint at the side of the road			1
but the contractor appears to have been oblivious to the signpost around which they 've painted - which clearly makes using the space impossible			1
the parking space in @entity8 , east @entity9 , was measured out and painted despite the presence of the signpost retired engineer @entity20 , 63 , spotted the metal post surrounded by fresh white paint as he walked his dog near his home on sunday			1
bemused grandfather - of - two mr @entity20 said : ' it really beggars belief			0
' i think the contractors must have been down the @entity31 pub at the end of the road before they started painting			2
' it smacks of the work of jobsworths but you 've got to laugh			0
' @entity39 said contractors ' mistakenly ' painted around the sign on a pavement and the paint would be removed as soon as possible			1
erroneous , and often baffling , council paint jobs are surprisingly common - in december , @entity45 's shortest double yellow lines were found on a street in @entity48			2
the road markings are designed to separate a residents ' parking zone ( left ) with a pay and display area ( right ) the lines have taken over the title as @entity45 's shortest double yellows from another set in @entity48 the 11 inches long marking on @entity57 , @entity58 , were designed to separate a residents ' parking zone with a pay and display area			2
but residents and motorists said the markings , which are about the same length as two @entity65 6 's , were a ' ridiculous ' waste of time and money and branded them ' pathetic '			0
@entity69 , of @entity70 , parked up next to the line and said : ' it is absolutely ridiculous			0
what a complete waste of time and money			0
i ca n't understand why they even bothered with it			0
' and the question is , are they the exact distance between the residents ' parking bays and the pay and display signs ? because they look a lot wider than that			0
' another bungled paint job to bewilder locals occurred in @entity91 when workers painted double yellow lines across the entrance to a hospital			1
the double yellow lines were painted through a busy t - intersection and across the face of a hospital the workers painted the no - parking zone outside @entity102 in @entity91 because they were using maps from before it was built			2
drivers labelled the situation an ' embarrassment ' and a ' waste of cash ' because @entity109 would have to get them removed			0
@entity110 , @entity39 's cabinet member for environment , said : ' this is a very silly mistake and i ’ll be taking this up with our contractor personally - this is n’t the first time common - sense has been called into question , there has been a catalogue of errors			1
