racism is widespread in @entity3 football with police having to deal with hundreds of incidents from the top of the game right down to grassroots level , an investigation has revealed			1
it also revealed that @entity11 supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents as they travelled to and from matches on trains			1
it follows the high - profile case of a black man who was prevented from boarding a train in @entity20 by @entity11 fans as they sang a racist song , with five of them due in court this week			1
@entity11 supporters have been involved in the highest number of reported racist incidents the information , gathered from 24 police forces across the country , shows there have been over 350 incidents since 2012			1
but as that only accounts for around half the police forces in the country , the actual figure is likely to be much higher			1
the charity @entity34 said the number of incidents shows that racism is a societal problem and it was particularly shocked by the number of incidents of racist abuse at children 's matches			1
the @entity44 said since 2012 it had dealt with 15 incidents of alleged racism involving @entity11 fans , the most of any club in the country			1
@entity49 were second with 10 incidents , followed by @entity51 with 10 , @entity52 with eight , @entity53 with four and @entity54 with four			0
@entity11 fans united with a banner stating ' black or white , we 're all blue ' ahead of @entity58 match a club spokesman for @entity11 said of the investigation : ' the club 's position on discriminatory behaviour is clear and we work closely with relevant authorities on their investigations			2
' @entity67 reported 46 incidents , which included a man cleaning a toilet in a stadium being told ' that 's a f * * * * * * black man 's job , you f * * * * * * n * * * * * ' and a manager at a children 's game being told ' i 'll do you , i 'm gon na wait for you outside , i 'm going to do you , you f * * * * * * n * * * * * '			2
the force also said that on two occasions a letter was written to a specific footballer containing racist abuse and during a game someone shouted ' what is this the @entity88 , how many chinks and w * * * do you need ? '			0
@entity91 recorded 11 incidents of alleged racist abuse at children 's football games , while @entity96 said that during a non-league game a man was spat at and racially abused before eventually having his leg broken in a strong challenge			0
some @entity11 fans were involved in an incident on the @entity104 , and supporters have worked hard in the aftermath to show that there is no racism at @entity109 @entity110 , campaign co-ordinator at @entity34 , said : ' this data from police forces around the @entity113 shows that although football clubs have taken strong action against people using racist language inside stadiums , racism is a real problem within society			1
' people who exhibit racist behaviours in 2015 are doing so , in the main , away from football grounds			0
' especially worrying are the incidents of racist abuse at youth team football matches			0
people engaged in racist abuse at these venues know that they are more likely to get away with it , because of facilities , a lack of stewarding and security , but the impact on young people will be considerable			0
' primarily , they are being exposed to racism , which in itself is frightening , but also it may influence their own behaviour			0
' other incidents included @entity141 reporting repeated monkey sounds and gestures during a @entity146 v @entity145 game in november last year and @entity147 and @entity148 said a man was headbutted and racially abused during a non-league game			0
@entity11 's programme cover for the match against @entity153 carried a clear message : ' we are all blue # equality ' @entity157 said a referee received racist insults during a kids ' game and @entity163 police said a footballer refused to shake hands with a player from the opposite team before racially abusing him			2
due to the fact that some police forces were unable to provide the information or did not reply to the request , mr @entity110 said there would certainly be a greater number of cases			1
' these incidents , although shocking in themselves and how geographically widespread they are , will be just a part of the picture , ' he said			2
' these are the incidents that have been reported			0
there will certainly be a greater number unreported and under - investigated			0
' @entity34 has always stated that the reason racism manifests in football is that it is a societal problem			1
' the campaign works with young people and adults not just to educate against racism , but encourage the use and development of critical thinking skills to break down the misinformation that supports racist beliefs			0
' a club spokesman for @entity11 said of the investigation : ' the club 's position on discriminatory behaviour is clear and we work closely with relevant authorities on their investigations			2
