as one viewer put it , the @entity0 should have renamed @entity2 , its latest big - budget period drama , ‘ the @entity4 ’			1
for hundreds who stayed in to watch it on easter monday night – including several actors – struggled to understand what was being said			1
the @entity0 has received more than 100 complaints over the adaptation of the novel by @entity14 , while more than a million viewers switched off during the programme			1
they reported having to switch on subtitles or turn up the volume to the maximum setting to understand the dialogue			2
the drama , set in 1821 against the bleak @entity28 moors , follows @entity35 , played by @entity37 star @entity36 , who is forced to live with her aunt and smuggler uncle when her mother dies			2
not that viewers were any the wiser			2
comedian @entity42 vented his frustration on @entity44 , writing : ‘ find out what happens next in @entity2 by getting your ears syringed ! ’ blunder : comedian @entity42 joked about the inaudible drama ' faulty ' : only @entity51 actor @entity50 joined the chorus of complaint had enough : this viewer changed channels out of frustration only option : these two viewers found they could only follow the action by turning on the subtitles ' going deaf ' : another viewer struggled to make it through the flagship programme new role : the programme stars @entity37 actress @entity36 , [ @entity35 ] , who goes to live with her aunt after her mother passes away @entity50 , best known for playing @entity69 in @entity70 , said he had n’t heard a single word , while former @entity73 judge @entity74 asked her followers whether anyone else was having trouble with the sound			1
viewer @entity79 tweeted : ‘ @entity2			0
even with a @entity28 accent			0
’ @entity82 , who wrote the screenplay for the adaptation , suggested that a technical fault , rather than the way that the cast delivered the lines , was to blame			0
she said : ‘ there was no problem on the version i saw , but tonight i could n’t hear			1
the director and executives were on the phone to the @entity0 from the off yelling , “ why ca n’t we hear it ? ” too late i fear			1
none of the production team know what happened with the sound			0
’ @entity101 , who directed the drama and recently won a @entity103 for @entity104 , told @entity105 : ‘ i think there was a sound issue ... i do n’t think anybody ’s actually got down to the bottom of why it happened			2
‘ my mum and dad live in the @entity113 and they did n’t have a problem			2
so i do n’t know if it was around the country or in some areas			0
‘ when we are dubbing , we always listen to it back on quite an old - fashioned ordinary telly			0
i suppose you ca n’t do everything for the vagaries of everybody ’s telly			0
’ in an apology , the @entity0 blamed ‘ issues with sound levels ’ , and said that although they could not be altered while the drama was on air , the dialogue was adjusted for last night ’s second episode and the third which airs tonight			1
initially the drama attracted an audience of 6.8million			0
by the end , it had fallen to 5.7million , bringing the average audience down to 6.1million			0
last year viewers of @entity0 drama @entity141 were left similarly frustrated , complaining of ‘ muffled ’ lines in one episode			1
the latest complaints come almost a year after @entity0 director - general @entity146 suggested bosses should look at how to stop actors ‘ muttering ’ in dramas			1
he also said that the @entity0 was addressing the issue of background music , which some viewers say drowns out dialogue			1
gripping : the drama , set in 1821 against the windswept @entity28 moors , was directed by @entity101 , whose credits include call the midwife			0
