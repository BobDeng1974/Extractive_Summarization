@entity0 must have been distracted			1
the @entity2 corner was wicked , @entity4 's movement direct ; the @entity6 goalkeeper span on his goalline to find @entity8 careering in from nowhere			2
the @entity10 defender latched on to the cross with a sweetly - hit volley four yards out			0
goal , surely ? no , on the turn @entity0 threw out two big hands and punch away at point - blank range			1
it was one of the most stunning saves at this @entity19			0
and this was no fluke			0
that split - second decision , to get his head straight and look directly at the effort before throwing his arms out , was technically flawless			0
@entity45 went out against @entity46 , thanks to a couple of goals @entity0 could do absolutely nothing about , and their goalkeeper has drawn a hefty chunk of the plaudits			1
@entity55 's volley was unstoppable and coach @entity56 could not legislate for the apparent @entity58 dive that eventually won @entity60 's side the game			2
up until the 88th minute @entity45 were through to the quarter - finals , where they would have played @entity64			1
that , in part , was down to the no 1			0
he made another super save , from @entity58 when bearing down on goal , and organised his defence with ultimate assurance			0
no wonder one @entity74 supporter has taken the rather unusual step of flogging his house , wife and kids in a bid to raise enough money - Â£ 8million he says - to keep @entity0 at the @entity83 outfit			1
trying getting past this ! @entity0 has become an internet sensation as he draws huge plaudits trying getting past this ! @entity0 has become an internet sensation as he draws huge plaudits it simply wo n't happen			2
he is out of contract this summer and will earn a move to one of @entity94 's top divisions			2
these string of performances wo n't have gone unnoticed , and he 's become an internet sensation over the past few days			0
social media has gone mad for his reflexes , with various mocked - up pictures going viral over the weekend			0
as one suggests , @entity44 , @entity101 , @entity102 and eventually @entity46 must 've felt as if they were coming up against a genuine brick wall			1
video @entity0 brilliance denies @entity44			1

@entity0 is likely to be *courted* by clubs across @entity94
@entity45 were eventually knocked out in @entity44 by @entity46
