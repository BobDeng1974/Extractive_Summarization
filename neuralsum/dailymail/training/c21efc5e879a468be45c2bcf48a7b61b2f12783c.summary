she spent her final months documenting her battle on @entity36 in a bid to raise £ 10,000 for @entity38 and @entity25 - based @entity39			1
she fell short of her goal , collecting £ 6,400 - but donations to her fundraising page have continued to flood in since her death			1
her eldest daughter , @entity44 said : ‘ in the week since @entity45 died £ 1,500 has been raised from people all over the world			1
‘ she was posting the ugly truth about living with cancer and i have continued - it does n’t end when the person has died			1
‘ i ’m so proud of her for everything			2
everybody who knew her loved her			2
she was always the go - to person			1
mrs @entity6 's only symptom for two years was that she was struggling to lift her arms			1
it was n't until she found a lump in her breast that she returned to her doctor and the cancer was found writing on her @entity36 page , @entity64 's @entity63 , the 46 - year - old raised awareness while documenting her fight with the disease			1
recalling the moment doctors uttered the devastating diagnosis , she wrote : ' being diagnosed with cancer was horrendous			1

‘ it ’s just horrific			2
i ’m 46 and i ’m never going to get old			2
' the fact that i have two small children is very hard to deal with too			2
i ’m never going to see them grow up			2
my children are going to lose their mummy			2
‘ my older children are obviously traumatised by my diagnosis , but they are very supportive			2
‘ nothing is the same for me now			0
my world has completely changed - i ’ve lost me , my identity , my life as i knew it			1

she said : ' my first step was chemo last friday			0
' now i have next chemo this friday and wig fitting on monday			0
' those who know me are aware that my hair is down my back and i 've had it very long most of my life			0
i thought having my head shaved was a grand idea			0
' and of course i will still go through with it			0
' however i now realise there are so many things to come to terms with when losing your hair			0
' the loss of feminine identity , the feeling of being a bit pretty , hair being a defining factor all my life , and ' no hair ' is not pretty			0
' i do n't suit scarves and my complexion is shot with the chemo			0
and that 's a fact , i have also seen how my lickle ones respond at the mention			0
it is a visual reminder mummy is n't well			0
so much to try and understand and that 's just the loss of hair			0
wig day has suddenly become very important x ' on november 9 , 2013 , the mother - of - five offered these words of wisdom to others , ' do n't count the days , make the days count '			1
a post on november 14 , said : ' can it get worse i ask myself ? yes it really can ... and i 'm sure it will			0
' i was advised not to see this as a battle but i think i will disagree			2
fighting this mind , body and should twister takes every ounce of my energy : will the chemo work ? if so , how much will it do ? how long have i got ? how awful on a scale of 10 today , oh another @entity148 i be able to walk today ? will i lose my hair today ? will my support fall away ? am i better off not existing at all ? it 's a veritable melting pot of teenage @entity152 wish i was a bigger person lol and able to be really grown up and level headed			0
i only needed another 20 years to reach that echelon			2
' ‘ she supported me during the birth of my children and was my birthing partner for all three of my births and she was amazing			0
‘ towards the end we were able to repay some of that support and we sang songs to her that she used to sing to us when we were young during her final hour			0
‘ she just got on with things			0
even when they stopped the medication she fought for another 24 hours			0
’ her daughter @entity168 , 20 , added : ‘ we were always a team and did everything together			0
it was me and her against the world			0
when i was at school all my friends would come over just to see her			0
whenever anyone had a problem they would turn to her			0

’ mrs @entity6 ’s family say she never blamed doctors for missing her cancer because the symptoms were so hard to detect			1
they say that when she visited her gp in 2011 all she was able to describe was having difficulty in raising her arms			1

‘ when she was diagnosed with cancer last year , doctors said they thought she had had it for three or four years			1
’ tragically , mrs @entity6 was given some positive news at the beginning of 2014 after scans showed no signs of cancer in her breast			1
but after a holiday to @entity243 in april she became unwell again and scans revealed the disease had returned			1

‘ the cancer seemed to have gone from her breasts and there was only one slightly enlarged lymph node			2
‘ they said that they had drugs that could control the liver - it was amazing news and we were all so hopeful			1
‘ they thought they had it under control and mum went on holiday in april			0
‘ while she was away she started to feel very unwell			0
on her return we found that the cancer had returned with a vengeance			1
‘ i 'm so proud of everything she 's done - she was just an amazing mum and grandmother			2
