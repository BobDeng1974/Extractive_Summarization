women who take paracetamol during pregnancy are more likely to have a child with @entity5 , new research suggests using paracetamol during pregnancy may raise the risk of children developing @entity5 , warn researchers			1
around half of women take over-the - counter painkillers during pregnancy , usually for headaches			1
researchers found that taking paracetamol ( know as acetaminophen in the @entity15 and the main ingredient in @entity17 ) increased the risk of hyperactivity disorders by up to a third			1
the risk was higher in mothers taking the painkillers for long periods while pregnant			1
the international team of researchers behind a new study warn that widespread use mean the results are important but need to be confirmed by further investigations			0
@entity31 , known as acetaminophen in some countries , may act as a hormone disruptor in the womb , interfering with normal brain development			1
@entity38 advice to pregnant women needing short - term pain relief is to take paracetamol at the lowest dose for the shortest period of time			1
@entity45 states : ‘ there is no clear evidence that it has any harmful effects on the unborn baby			0
’ but the new study suggests taking the over-the - counter pills in pregnancy could be linked to @entity5 , which stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder			2
@entity5 is the term given to a collection of behavioural problems linked to poor attention span including impulsiveness , restlessness and hyperactivity			2
an estimated 400,000 @entity60 children have @entity5 , with many prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school			0
the new study looked at data on more than 64,000 children and mothers in @entity67 between 1996 and 2002 , while parents reported behavioural problems on a questionnaire			0
more than half the mothers reported using paracetamol while pregnant			0
its use was linked with a 37 per cent higher risk of hyperkinetic disorders - a severe form of @entity5			1
children of women using the painkiller were 29 per cent more at risk of eventually taking drugs to control @entity5 , and 13 per cent more likely to have @entity5 - like behaviours at the age of seven			1
there were higher risks for the children of women who used the drug for six months or more while pregnant and higher amounts			2
taking paracetamol during pregnancy could increase the risk of @entity5 by up to a third the risk of hyperkinetic disorders almost doubled and the risk for receiving adhd drugs rose 50 per cent , says a report in @entity97			1
dr @entity98 of the @entity99 , @entity100 , who led the team , said : ‘ some recent studies have suggested that acetaminophen has effects on sex and other hormones , which in turn can affect neurodevelopment and cause behavioural dysfunction			0
‘ because the exposure and outcomes are frequent , these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed			0
’ about half of women take over-the - counter painkillers while they are pregnant previous research has suggested painkillers including paracetamol in pregnancy may harm development of the sex organs in unborn boys			1
a study found prolonged use of painkillers - two weeks or more - may contribute to an increased risk in boys born with undescended testicles			2
dr @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , @entity134 , and co-author of an editorial on the latest research , said : ‘ this is an interesting but preliminary study which requires further investigation to see if there really is a causal link between taking paracetamol during pregnancy and adhd in childhood			0
‘ these findings should therefore be taken with caution and should not change practice			0
‘ there are many reasons why women take paracetamol during pregnancy and it is possible that it is one of those factors , rather than the taking of paracetamol itself , which leads to a higher risk of childhood adhd			1
‘ it may be important to take medications such as paracetamol during pregnancy and pregnant women should continue to follow advice from their own healthcare professionals			2
’ professor @entity164 , @entity165 at the @entity166 said : ‘ the study on a large sample of @entity170 mothers was carefully conducted and analysed			0
however , as the authors recognise , and the accompanying editorial makes plain , an association in such an observational study can not establish a causal link			0
‘ the study should be used as basis for further experimental research not least because exposure to paracetamol during pregnancy is so common			0

@entity31 could increase the risk of hyperactivity disorders by a third
the risk is higher for women who take the painkiller for a long time
it can act as a hormone disruptor , interfering with brain development
