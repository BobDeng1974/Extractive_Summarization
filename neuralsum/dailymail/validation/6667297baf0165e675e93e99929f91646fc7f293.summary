his lack of goalscoring early on in his @entity3 career might have drawn some critics , but @entity5 is the best signing of the season in terms of chance creation - ahead even of @entity10 assists king @entity11			1
@entity12 have compiled the top 12 signings of the season in the top five @entity15 leagues for rigour , take - ons , recovery , chance creation , distribution and shooting - using statistics to analyse and narrow them down			1
and £ 75million summer buy @entity5 comes out on top in the ' chance creation ' category ahead of two of the @entity10 's finest , @entity11 and @entity26 's @entity25			1
@entity5 has been the best signing in terms of chance creation this season , say @entity12 @entity11 is in second place on the ' chance creation ' indicator despite his 15 league this season here are how the @entity33 ( @entity34 ) work : chance creation : ability to put team - mates in a good position to score			1
shooting : ability to take advantage of goal opportunities through accurate shooting			0
take on : ability to create dangerous situations by successfully challenging opponents			0
distribution : ability to keep a hold on the game through efficient passing			0
recovery : ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through proficient interception work			0
@entity56 : ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling			0
@entity5 seems to finally be finding his feet at the @entity60 , and he scored twice in the 2 - 1 win at @entity62 in the first leg of @entity3 's @entity64 last - 16 tie - but it 's his work in support of team - mates which has really impressed his manager and supporters since his summer arrival			2
he has scored just 10 times in all competitions in 24 games , but there is no crisis because of a love for the new @entity5 – the one who makes their all - star front three of him , @entity83 and @entity84 tick			2
that new - found selflessness puts him ahead of @entity11 in terms of chance creation - despite the @entity90 star 's 15 assists in the @entity10 this season			2
that has obviously come at a sacrifice though , and @entity5 has n't been able to get close to the no 1 signing in the shooting category : @entity90 's @entity96			1
@entity98 @entity3 @entity90 @entity26 @entity99 @entity99 1			0
@entity103 @entity90 @entity104 @entity105 @entity106 @entity107 @entity5 has moved from a goalscorer role to that of a provider since moving to @entity3 in the summer @entity96 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) have formed a deadly combination for @entity90 since signing @entity96 is tops the rankings for ' shooting ' as shown here by his fierce effort leading to a goal against @entity118 an impressive 17 league goals put @entity96 top ahead of @entity104 's @entity100 top scorer in the @entity10 with 17 league goals , and having played a key part in the @entity127 ' @entity126 triumph against @entity118 on sunday , nobody would contest that £ 32m @entity96 has settled perfectly into the @entity129 set - up			1
behind him is @entity104 's @entity100 who looked to have been signed primarily as the creative force to feed another signing , @entity132 , but instead has been showing his own goalscoring prowess in a more advanced role			0
some more surprising names in that list come from @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 in the form of @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 respectively - with @entity139 's bargain buy @entity140 coming in just outside the top five in seventh			0
@entity144 , despite his recent drought , is 12th			0
@entity148 @entity149 @entity150 @entity151 @entity152 @entity153 1			0
@entity156 @entity157 @entity90 @entity99 @entity158 @entity3 @entity145 ( left ) is top for ' take on ' as he showed by going past @entity104 's @entity159 last week @entity146 ( left ) has struggled to keep up his standards at @entity150 but does well for ' take ons ' @entity154 might have been surplus to requirements at @entity99 but his distribution is valued at @entity157 @entity11 ' passing ability has helped to bring @entity90 to the level of potential league champions this season another surprise name doing well in the distribution group is former @entity170 flop @entity155 ( left ) @entity172 's summer business has been widely lauded and it is perhaps telling that @entity11 is also second in the ' distribution ' indicator , with none of @entity90 's former players who moved on making it into the top 12 of any of the categories			1
@entity11 is only ousted in the list focused on efficient passing by @entity157 's @entity154 , who is top ahead of his replacement at @entity99 , @entity98 , in third			1
@entity158 's @entity155 , who signed from relegation @entity170 in the summer is fourth with @entity156 fifth			0
players from the @entity10 dominate the ' take on ' group , with @entity146 ( second ) , @entity144 ( third ) and @entity148 ( fifth ) - although all fall in the wake of @entity149 trickster , and reported @entity150 target , @entity145			1
@entity193 @entity194 @entity149 @entity195 @entity196 @entity197 1			2
@entity201 @entity202 @entity197 @entity203 @entity204 @entity196 @entity189 ( right ) looks to have been a top signing for @entity194 if you trust his recovery stats @entity198 ( left ) surprisingly tops the ' rigour ' category despite a difficult first season with @entity202 @entity203 's @entity199 ( left ) is another surprise name on that list after moving from @entity150 while there are some surprise names on the lists , perhaps the biggest is @entity202 's £ 20m centre back @entity198 , who somehow finishes top of the ' rigour ' category for ' ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling '			1
@entity198 , widely regarded as a transfer flop , finishes ahead of @entity197 's @entity193 - who also scored highly in the ' recovery ' category - and @entity203 's @entity199			1
and @entity226 seems to have done good business in signing @entity189 for @entity194			2
he tops the ' recovery ' category with only one @entity229 - based player in the top 12 , @entity150 's @entity228 - in 12th place			2
@entity150 's @entity228 is the only top 12 player in terms of ' recovery ' from the @entity10			0

stats from @entity12 *reveal* this season 's top signings
@entity5 has been a better creator of chances than @entity11
@entity96 is no 1 at shooting out of all big - five league signings
@entity198 surprisingly tops ' rigour ' category ahead of @entity199
@entity157 's @entity154 is the best distributor bought this season
@entity149 's @entity145 beats @entity146 for ' take ons '
@entity189 , signed by @entity194 in the summer , tops ' recovery ' table
