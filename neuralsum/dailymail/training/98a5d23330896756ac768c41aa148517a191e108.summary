@entity8 was hired by @entity9 in 2007 and worked for the company until august 2013 when the catholic social services organisation terminated her employment after discovering her contact details listed on the @entity15 website			2
a group calling themselves ' @entity17 ' describes the community as a ' social and discussion group based in @entity1 for all who are interested in open relationships , polyamory , and the varied alternatives to monogamy '			0
@entity8 was fired from @entity4 organisation @entity9 after the company discovered her details on a polyamorous website the @entity30 judgement showed that ms @entity8 had been accused by @entity9 of gross misconduct , breaching the company 's code of conduct and bringing the it into disrepute			1
ms @entity8 was informed that her lifestyle contradicted the morals of the @entity4 , and was given five weeks salary after she was listed online as a member of the @entity15			1
her details had been listed on the site as a ' poly - friendly counselor ' between 2011 and 2012 following a request from one of the group members , which was pointed out to her during a meeting in august 2013 with two managers of @entity9			2
she was confronted by her colleagues with a printed out list of the members , and was questioned whether her involvement was for professional or personal reasons			0
ms @entity8 claimed that she had been discriminated against as because of her sex , and originally made several submissions to the @entity55 , who dismissed her allegations as ' misconceived '			1
justice @entity58 concluded that her ' behaviour ' differed from ' sexual orientation ' ms @entity8 worked for @entity9 and worked for the company until august 2013 after her complaint to the @entity55 was denied , she then took her case to the @entity30 , where judge @entity58 handed down his judgement on february 11 , and dismissed the appeal on the basis that it had no ' reasonable prospect of success '			1

' sexual orientation is how one is , rather than how one manifests that state of being			0
the manifestation of that state of being can take many forms , ' @entity80 said			0
' if the contention of the applicant were correct , many people whose sexual activity might label them as sado - masochists , coprophiliacs or urophiliacs could claim that such is more than mere behaviour ; it is in fact their very sexual orientation , ' @entity80 said			0
the @entity30 judgement showed that ms @entity8 had been accused of gross misconduct figures for the @entity98 indicate that almost half a million people identify as polyamorous justice @entity58 said that the result would be of ' absurdity ' if the court accepted polyamory as sexual orientation , and could lead people to campaign for the protection of paedophilia and necrophilia under the @entity109 of 1984			1
he ruled that despite finding his ruling ' unpalatable ' , ms @entity8 should be allowed to ' ventilate her grievance ' , ' no matter what the merits or the probability of success ' on her claim			2
there are currently no figures on the number of people in @entity122 who consider themselves polyamorous , reported the @entity123			0
however , figures for the @entity98 indicate that almost half a million people identify as polyamorous , a behaviour which has been defined as ' ethical non-monogamy ' , the @entity17 and @entity9 have been contacted for comment .			0
