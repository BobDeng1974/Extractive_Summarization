we 've all experienced the humiliation of struggling to manoeuvre a car in a tight space in front of a crowd			2
but for this woman , the price was higher than mere embarrassment			0
her mistake was to try to do a three - point turn outside the home of new foreign secretary @entity12			2
scroll to down for video the foreign secretary 's minders apparently decided to take action after the woman veered towards their @entity18 one minder , who had been waiting outside foreign secretary @entity12 's house , decided to take action after watching the woman 's three - point turn deteriorate into a seven - point turn in the @entity25 the minders called in armed officers after becoming concerned and the woman 's keys were confiscated and her @entity30 searched ( pictured )			1
it was then decided the car would be towed away from the scene the woman ended up watching her black @entity30 ( front right ) being towed away after the officers took action and as her disastrous attempt soon became a seven - point turn , plain - clothes protection officers became suspicious			1
when her @entity30 then veered sharply towards their black @entity18 , the policemen swooped			0
after questioning her and searching her vehicle , they discovered she was driving without a licence and called in back - up to the narrow street in @entity46 , one of @entity49 ’s wealthiest areas			1
armed police officers arrived on motorbikes moments later to issue the hapless driver with a ticket			1
she then watched as her black car was towed away			2
a witness said : ‘ the officers were outside mr @entity12 ’s house waiting for him to come out			1
she [ the motorist ] was trying to make a three - point turn and looked as though she was about to crash into them			0
‘ one of the officers sounded the horn to stop her and then they got out and questioned her before calling uniformed officers in			0
the woman looked really fed up and had to get the bus home			1
’ the incident occurred at 8.30am on july 19 , just four days after @entity70 ’s reshuffle , in which it was announced that mr @entity12 , 58 , would be replacing @entity72 as foreign secretary			0

the average price of a terrace house on the exclusive street is £ 3.6million , and the surrounding area has been home to @entity92 and @entity94 actor sir @entity93			0
@entity95 - educated mr @entity12 , who is thought to be worth £ 9million , also has a nine - bedroom house in @entity97 , @entity98			0
