@entity0 is 365 million miles from @entity2			1
but these heavyweights of our solar system have a huge influence on what goes on in our planet , and could be to thank for humanity 's existence			0
the orbits of these planets are keeping our world moving in a circular path at just the right distance from the sun for life to flourish			0
moving @entity2 's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out @entity0 's orbit by tens of millions of miles			1
this view is looking towards the sunlit side of @entity2 â€™s rings from about 25 degrees above the ringplane moving @entity2 's orbit just 10 per cent closer to the sun creates a tug that would stretch out @entity0 's orbit by tens of millions of miles			1
this is according to @entity29 of the @entity30 , @entity31 , who has developed computer models to understand how @entity1 and @entity2 affected the shape of other planets ' orbits			1
using a simple model that did not include other inner planets , professor @entity36 found that the greater the tilt , the more the elongation in @entity0 's orbit , according to a report by @entity43 in the @entity44			1
@entity1 's gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of @entity0 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own			1
when @entity51 and @entity52 were added to the model , the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly , but @entity2 's tilt still had a major influence on @entity0 when @entity51 and @entity52 were added to the model , the orbits of all three planets stabilised slightly , but @entity2 's tilt still had a major influence on @entity0			1
it is known as the ' @entity57 ' due to a crater making it look like the @entity60 weapon			0
however , astronomers say they are a step closer to solving a mystery that has baffled them for decades about @entity2 's @entity65			2
the moon has an odd wobble - and scientists say its core is is either wonky or awash with water			0
it has a tell - tale wobble that is twice as big as expected for a moon with a regular , solid structure			0
@entity75 is mostly made of ice and has a diameter of 246 miles ( 396km )			0
the researchers offer two explanations for the wobble : either it has a vast ocean beneath its surface , or a rocky core with a weird shape resembling a rugby ball			0
apart from these gentle ' librations ' , @entity75 otherwise presents the same face to @entity2 throughout its orbit			2
the model found that 20 - degree tilt of @entity2 would bring the @entity0 's orbit closer to the sun than @entity52			1
it would also cause @entity51 to leave the solar system entirely			0
in a similar study earlier this year , the @entity96 and @entity97 , ran various computer models of our solar system			0
with each iteration , the planets in the solar system remained in their place while @entity1 moved around in different obits , ranging from circular to elliptical			0
the scientists also moved the entire orbit of @entity1 inwards and outwards to test what would have happened if the planet had formed closer to the sun , or further away			2
each simulation was taken through a million year time frame , recording where @entity0 would have been every 100 years as a result of @entity1 's position			2
' the default assumption is this is something that is important , ' said @entity119 , an astronomer and astrobiologist at the @entity121			0
' there 's a lot of flexibility where @entity1 will be , and you would assume that you 'd have a very smooth , very gentle variation in how the @entity0 's orbit behaves over time			1
' while @entity1 's locations resulted in little change in @entity0 's orbit and tilt , the effect on @entity0 's climate remained unclear			1
@entity1 's gravity , which is 2.5 times stronger than that of @entity0 's , is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own			2

bringing @entity2 's orbit 10 per cent closer to sun creates a tug on @entity0
tug is strong enough to stretch @entity0 's orbit by tens of millions of miles
this is according to computer models created by @entity30
@entity1 has a far more gentle variation in how the @entity0 's orbit behaves
