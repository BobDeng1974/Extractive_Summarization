the @entity2 released the two photos and is asking for the public 's help finding the person , whom the department is referring to as a person of interest			1
he has not yet been named , nor has the off - duty detective who witnessed the attack			1
@entity21 , 38 , who police say is the biker seen in a video smashing his helmet against @entity27 ’s @entity26 and yanking him out of the vehicle , came forward friday night along with 35 - year - old @entity29 - who was shown in the video stomping on the driver 's head			1
do you know this man : he is wanted by the @entity2 for questioning in custody : @entity21 , 38 ( pictured left and right ) surrendered himself to police in connection to the sunday attack on an suv driver an @entity2 spokesman declined to comment saturday evening as the unidentified person of interest 's involvement in the attack			1
both mr chance and mr @entity29 have been charged with attempted assault , gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon , according to the @entity51			1
mr @entity29 was seen on video stomping on the defenseless father 's head , as well as punching and kicking him , of his terrified wife and two - year - old daughter			1
mr @entity27 suffered two black eyes , as well as cuts on his face requiring stitches , according to a criminal complaint			0
' the defendant is clearly seen stomping on [ @entity27 ’s ] head , ' assistant district attorney @entity62 told @entity66 judge @entity65 during saturday arraignment			0
a staggering $ 100,000 cash bail was set			0
both men have lengthy criminal records , with mr @entity21 's rap sheet showing 21 arrests for a litany of crimes including felony drug , robbery and weapons charges			1
mr @entity29 ' criminal past includes car theft , drug and weapons possession charges - including for a samurai sword			1
meanwhile , @entity2 spokesman @entity84 confirmed saturday that the unnamed detective believed to be an off - duty narcotics officer and member of a biker club was stripped of his gun and badge pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation why it took the agent four days to come forward			1
he was riding with the @entity96 biker club , according to the @entity51			2
the papers aid the club also counts several others among its members			0
mr @entity84 said internal affairs was also trying to determine investigating whether any other officers were present during the sunday altercation and did n't immediately report it			1
it has been reported this week that at least five off - duty cops witnessed the beating of mr @entity27 , who was driving an suv on the @entity108 last sunday with his family inside			1
the incident left @entity27 needing stitches and motorcyclist @entity112 possibly paralyzed			2
among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack			1
one of the detectives , the undercover narcotics agent , watched as the violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his cover			1
undercover officers are required to immediately report being a witness to a crime			2
uniformed officers are required to take police action if they see a crime occurring , but the rules are murkier for undercover officers who face blowing their cover , confusing civilians who do n't realize the undercover is really a cop and compromising years - long investigations			1
before and after : @entity112 suffered a broken spine , fractured ribs , a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again the five officers were not the only ones present , @entity143 is reporting that the @entity2 is investigating whether several off - duty corrections officers were also there			1
police who saw the violent attack did not begin coming forward until wednesday - four days later			1
investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the @entity154 video of the assault , according to @entity143			0
they plan to talk to as many as possible , the station noted			0
' this is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved , ' a source told @entity143			2
one of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that mr @entity27 ' drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side , ' adding ' when he bumped that bike on the side , that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger , ' according to @entity143			2
the @entity51 originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene , as several members of the motorcycle group - called the @entity176 - are police officers themselves			1
when reached friday by @entity180 for comment , an @entity2 spokesperson said only that the involvement of off - duty officers ' is under investigation			1
' ' it is does not appear that he got involved at the scene , ' a police source told @entity188 , which added that the undercover officer has hired a lawyer			1
it started with this tap : mr @entity27 's @entity193 tapped the back tire of this motorcycle , causing all hell to break loose on camera : this shows the moment the @entity193 driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child			2
it is believed he hit @entity207 here smashed : when they come to a standstill in heavy traffic , it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle , smashing the driver 's window with his helmet he was not the only one to do so , as longtime partner of @entity112 , the man who was run over by the car , has hired famed defender @entity220			1
' he is the best father i know , ' @entity221 said at a friday press conference			2
' to learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again - that is all still sinking in			2
' it tears me up that anyone could think that @entity112 in anyway deserves what happened to him			2
' mr @entity207 was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black @entity193 on @entity234 's @entity233 last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped , police said			2
@entity237 captured at the scene shows the suv surrounded by helmeted riders			0
damage : the broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target of the bikers ' wrath scary : the @entity247 said they feared for their lives towed away : the car was brought to the @entity2 's 33 precinct on friday in the video , one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver 's side window			1
police said others tried to damage the suv before the driver , mr @entity27 , took off and plowed over @entity207			0
the bikers then chased after mr @entity27 and smashed his car window with their helmets , then pulled him from the suv and beat him to the point where he required stitches			2
@entity266 , mr @entity27 's wife , said in a prepared statement that her family 's sympathies go out to mr @entity207 , but that they had to flee a dangerous situation			0
' he is the best father i know , ' @entity221 , @entity207 ' longtime partner , said at a friday press conference support : ms @entity221 , seen with attorney @entity220 and @entity207 ' father @entity274 , said that they are still coping with how to deal with @entity112 's injuries mr @entity277 said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2 - year - old child , who was also in the car at the time			1

pain : ms @entity221 said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner ' he told everyone to move on and go back to riding , and turned his back to the suv to start walking back to his own bike , ' @entity220 said			0
' it was then , with his back to the suv , and as he was in front of it , that he was run over and crushed , ' the attorney added			0
a difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a ' perception ' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on sunday , said ms @entity221 ' they are not gang members			0
they are not thugs , ' mr @entity315 said			0
' they are @entity319 drivers , plumbers , military reservists , musicians			0
they are fathers and brothers and sons , and sisters and mothers			0
' she also said mr @entity207 , the father of her children , did n't know any of the people he was riding with on sunday aside from one friend who traveled to @entity332 with him			0
the potentially paralyzed biker was recently arrested in @entity334 , @entity284 , for driving with a revoked license			0
he also never applied for a motorcycle license			0
records show that in june mr @entity207 was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017			0
it was n't clear if he had been licensed in any other state			0
