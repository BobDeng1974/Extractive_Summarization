@entity1 's @entity0 gave a teasing hint about his @entity4 future by saying the decision would seem obvious once announced and he was unlikely to drive for a @entity7 - powered team			1
' i 'm not in a hurry ... i understand the curiosity , and i understand , for the fans , the news that can be around the future , ' the @entity10 told reporters at the inaugural @entity17 @entity16			0
' but do not worry , do not worry			0
just relax , enjoy , and when it 's time to know it , you will know it			0
@entity1 's @entity0 ( right ) says it is ' unlikely ' that he will be driving for @entity7 next season ' my mind is set , for the last two or three months , and when you know you will understand that probably it was very obvious what i would do , ' added the double world champion			1
in a separate interview with @entity30 television , @entity0 said ' i do n't think so ' when asked if he would be driving for a team with @entity7 engines			2
that would appear to leave only a return to @entity35 , who are starting a new partnership with @entity38 , or staying at @entity1 as the 33 - year - old 's realistic options of a drive given that @entity43 - powered @entity42 have announced a 2015 line - up			2
@entity0 has been at @entity1 since 2010 , but has never won a @entity45 with the @entity47 team @entity35 have said repeatedly that they have not yet made any decision about their drivers			1
although @entity0 has a contract at @entity1 until the end of 2016 , he is expected to leave at the end of the year to make way for four - times champion @entity54 unless current team mate @entity55 leaves			1
@entity55 , @entity1 's 2007 champion , has a contract for 2015 but has been eclipsed by @entity0 this year			2
the @entity58 driver could yet remain with @entity1 , but only if @entity55 leaves the team @entity54 announced last week that he was leaving @entity42 at the end of the year , with that team 's principal @entity60 saying the driver was heading for @entity1			1
neither @entity1 nor the @entity62 have confirmed anything			0
maintaining the intrigue , @entity0 also said he wanted to do his best for the future of @entity1			0
' my decision ... was to help this fantastic team , and i 'm extremely happy with the things that will come , ' he said			0
@entity60 said @entity42 's @entity54 is joining @entity1 , but it has n't yet been officially announced			1

@entity0 set to leave @entity1 at the end of the season
@entity58 driver says it is unlikely he will drive for @entity7
but former @entity4 champion says his decision is ' obvious '
@entity54 joining @entity1 next season
