aspiring police officers have hit out at force chiefs for insisting they study for and pass a new £ 1,300 certificate before they can start the job			1
police hopefuls - who would previously have been trained on the job - now say they have been put off by new rules which mean they need to spend 300 hours studying before they can even start their official training			1
the @entity8 in @entity9 is already a requirement to join six police forces , including the @entity12 , and other forces are considering introducing the new standard			1
barriers : young people hoping to join the @entity12 , like these new officers pictured at a ' passing out ' parade , will need a £ 1,300 qualification the @entity20 , which has developed the course , has said it will help make the police ' a true professional service ' like medicine or the law			1
under the new system applicants will be sent out to study with external providers who charge between £ 600 and £ 1,300 for the course			1
one 25 - year - old prospective officer , who declined to be named , said there is ' no way ' he could afford to splash out on a course which provides only ' basic training '			1
the history graduate , who holds a master 's degree from @entity37 , has already racked up £ 20,000 of student debt and is not prepared to risk money training for a job he may never get			1
he told careers site @entity42 : ' i could n’t believe it when i saw i ’d need a specific qualification – costing up to £ 1,300			1
diversity ? met police commissioner @entity46 , pictured at a ceremony marking the recruitment of new officers , has said he wants to recruit a wider range of people into the force ' the course content seems to be little more than legal theory that i assumed would be considered part of basic training for successful candidates			1
' having had only temporary employment since graduating , i decided not to apply , for the simple reason that if i was rejected , it would be wasted money			0
' i graduated with £ 20,000 of student loans and there is no way i can afford to gamble more money on a job i could be rejected for at any stage			2
' i do n’t feel it ’s fair for the @entity12 to ask for applicants to pay for their own training ... they will certainly miss out on other young candidates like me who are worried about money			0
' to lots of young people , the £ 1,300 price tag for the @entity74 is certainly enough to put us off from applying			1
' the course - which will only enable applicants to apply for policing jobs - includes basic policing duties such as how not to misuse their powers , how to search buildings and people and how to conduct interviews			2
@entity87 mp for @entity88 and @entity90 @entity89 is campaigning against the fee			0
she said : ' why should our best , most talented youngsters have to fork out £ 1,000 for the privilege of joining the police ? and she has set up an e-petition against it			1
she added : i 'm asking you to sign a petition			0
let 's get the message through to @entity103			0
' the new requirement comes despite the insistence of met police commissioner @entity46 that the force should try to attract as wide a range of people as possible			2
last week he said he would support a new system in which the organisation would have to take on a new ethnic minority officer for every white officer they take on			0
he hopes the change will leave the force ' looking and feeling ' more like @entity119 - though the force has admitted that the new qualification has the ' potential for adverse impact on individuals from @entity125 ( black and minority ethnic ) backgrounds			1
' the @entity12 has said it will introduce loans to cover course fees from may , but applicants will have to pass a means test and will only be available for those who already live in @entity119			2
@entity132 , founder of @entity42 said : ' the government and the @entity12 should admit they have got this policy wrong - it is not fair or right to demand that young applicants stump up such a large amount of money on the off - chance they may be offered a job later			2
' even providing loans wo n't fix the problem - unsuccessful applicants would still be left out - of - pocket			2
' a @entity20 spokesman said : ' the certificate is an excellent grounding in policing and the skills are transferable to other areas of the criminal justice system			0
' there are a lot of changes happening in policing at the moment and as part of that , the job of the @entity20 is to professionalise the service			0
the police are moving in a direction of being a true professional service , similar to other professions such as medicine and law			0
' there was nothing in place before the certificate , so now candidates have the chance to educate themselves on policing and take responsibility for their learning			0
’ a @entity12 spokesman said : ' we support any initiative that 's about raising standards and competence in policing , and the @entity74 has a role to play in that			0
' policing is no different from many other professions , in requiring those interested in a career to achieve a specific qualification before joining			0
