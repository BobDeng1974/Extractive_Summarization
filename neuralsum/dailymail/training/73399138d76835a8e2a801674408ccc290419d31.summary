@entity0 warned @entity1 he is prepared to take @entity2 out of the @entity3 if his demands are not met @entity0 today warns @entity1 that he is prepared to take @entity2 out of @entity5 – as he states his determination to serve a full second term in @entity8			1
the prime minister – marking the effective start of the @entity12 campaign with an exclusive interview with @entity14 – declared just days before a meeting in @entity16 with @entity18 chancellor @entity17 : ‘ if i do n’t get what is needed i rule nothing out			1
’ mr @entity0 , who pledges to ‘ hit the ground running – and hard ’ if he is re-elected in may , warns @entity23 ’s budget plans would cost £ 13.5billion extra just in interest payments on the deficit , more than the police and transport budgets combined , if @entity28 became @entity9			1
he says : ‘ this is the most important election for a generation , a real choice between a continued competence or disaster			0
this is all about security from the conservatives and the chaos you ’d get from everybody else			0
if you lose control of your debt and deficit , you get massive cuts in things such as health and education			0
you get appalling insecurity , jobs lost , firms going overseas			0
’ the @entity9 ’s warning came as @entity23 launched its own campaign today with posters claiming that the @entity52 in its current form would not survive another five years of a @entity55 government			2
shadow health secretary @entity56 said the health service would fall prey to a ‘ toxic mix of cuts and privatisation ’ if mr @entity0 was returned to @entity62			2
in a highly personal and wide - ranging interview , mr @entity0 promises to introduce reforming legislation on education and welfare within the first 50 days of a new government , says that he is so close to @entity68 that the @entity70 president calls him ‘ bro ’ , reveals that he authorised the removal from the @entity55 candidates list of an aide to home secretary @entity74 , and tells @entity75 that he will have to wait for a @entity77 seat			1
amid speculation at @entity80 about his political future if he does not win a convincing victory in may , or if he is felled by @entity55 @entity5 rebels unhappy about his strategy over the 2017 @entity3 referendum , mr @entity0 says he is determined to stay in @entity8 until 2020 : ‘ we have to see it through , ’ he says			1
the prime minister said his discussions with mrs @entity17 on wednesday would include the so - called ‘ red lines ’ – areas of national policy which he needs to be repatriated to the @entity2 if his government is to back a vote to remain in the @entity3			1
@entity23 ’s high command today launches a four - month campaign to prove that the @entity52 would not ‘ survive another five years of @entity0 ’ , claiming that cutbacks would lead to nearly two million waiting longer than four hours at casualty departments and more than 20 million patients left waiting a week or more to see a gp			2
but the attack was immediately blunted when former @entity23 welfare minister @entity114 said his own party showed no signs of facing up to the ‘ existential crisis ’ engulfing the health service			0
in an article for @entity14 , the senior @entity23 mp accused mr @entity28 of coming up with ‘ sticking plasters and short - term palliatives ’ for the @entity52 , not the ‘ far - sighted vision ’ needed to save the service from extinction			0
mr @entity114 also accused mr @entity0 of being too scared to tell voters what needed to be done to save the @entity52 .			0
