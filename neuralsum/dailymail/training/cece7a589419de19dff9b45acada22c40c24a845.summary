by @entity0 a @entity2 worker went to drive home after finishing her shift only to find the entire front end of her car had been stolen			1
@entity8 , 58 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was stunned to discover the bumper , bonnet and headlights had been taken from her silver @entity15 in broad daylight on friday			1
the vehicle , which she had left in the staff car park of the store in @entity20 , @entity10 , will need around £ 2,000 worth of repairs to get it back on the road			1
it is thought the audacious criminals struck at some point in the afternoon , as the car was still in tact when the worker went on her lunch break			1
however , as the car park was not covered by @entity32 , it will be hard to determine an exact time			2
@entity8 , 58 , left work to discover the bumper , bonnet and headlights ( pictured ) had been taken from her @entity15 while it was parked in the staff car park it is thought repairs to the car to get it back on the road will cost in the region of £ 2,000 mrs @entity8 's mechanic husband @entity45 , 61 , said : ' she was quite upset - the @entity15 was stripped of the front end while in the staff car park			1
' we asked @entity2 to check their cctv but the staff car park is not covered by the cameras			1
' someone must have seen whoever did this walking off with a bonnet , bumper and headlights			0
' '' i 'm a mechanic myself so when my wife phoned and said the bonnet had been stolen			0
i told her just to drive it home and i would fix it			2
' but then she said she could n't as the lights had gone too , and the bumper , so it 's completely undrivable			0
' he told @entity64 : ' i drove down there , and i asked the store manager to get the @entity32 while we were waiting for the police , in the hope that they might be able to trace them , but we were gob - smacked when he said there was none			0
the theft took place outside the @entity2 store in @entity20 , @entity10 ( pictured ) at some point after lunch ' she was parked in the area designated for staff , so i think they should be held responsible			2
that ’s where they ’ve been told to park and they have an obligation to look after their staff			0
' i ca n’t believe that no - one saw anything - it ’s a busy car park and it was in broad daylight			1
for someone who knows what they ’re doing , it ’s a 20 to 25 minute job , so someone must have noticed them			0
' i ’ve priced the parts and for those alone it ’s going to cost £ 1,000 plus vat , so it ’s going to cost us well over £ 2,000			2
' @entity107 police confirmed they are investigating the theft			0
@entity2 declined to comment on the incident or mr @entity111 ’s claims .			0

@entity8 went to drive home after long day shift at @entity2
was stunned to discover entire front end of her @entity15 had been taken
believed the audacious *thieves* struck after lunch on friday afternoon
car park has no cctv - so it will be difficult to catch the *culprits*
thought repairs to the vehicle may cost the 58 - year - old around £ 2,000
