but the work really began towards the end of 2007 when the @entity9 city was confirmed as the host for the @entity39 , beating @entity231 , the @entity232 capital			2
since then the @entity233 has given @entity2 further inspiration , but a lot to live up to			2

on the move : @entity182 football manager @entity288 carries the @entity33 through mount @entity289 in @entity2 last week the @entity63 's baton will reach its final destination at the opening ceremony of the @entity4 after a journey of more than 120,000 miles			1
the baton has travelled through 70 nations and territories since it was sent on its way by the @entity63 at @entity194 last october			0
the unique hand - crafted baton , made of titanium , wood and granite , has been carried by tens of thousands around the globe during its epic 248 - day tour around the @entity4			0

there the @entity63 will officially begin the @entity39 by reading aloud her message of support to @entity4 athletes , which she placed inside the baton at the start of its journey			2
the secret note was written during a summer stay at her @entity254 retreat of @entity339 and was housed in a transparent cylinder within the baton 's pure titanium lattice - work frame			0
the relay is a tradition that started in 1958 , and symbolises the gathering of people from across the @entity4			0
