three days before the @entity2 , president @entity1 's advisers fretted about including a line promising that participants in the still - viable hillarycare insurance overhaul would be allowed to keep their favored doctors and health care plans , a concern that would come back years later when president @entity9 promised the same thing			1
the line , which made it into the final speech in a slightly different form – @entity1 told @entity15 they would have ' the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor ' – was the subject of controversy because his aides knew it was untrue			1
' we have a line on p. 10 that says " you 'll pick the health plan and the doctor of your choice , " ' an internal memo read			2
' i know that it 's just what people want to hear			0
but can we get away with it ? ' he asked			0
' i am very worried about getting skewered for over-promising here on something we know full well we wo n't deliver			0
' the @entity43 ' first term in the @entity44 was marred by the failure of ' @entity46 , ' an earlier proposed version of what would later become law as the @entity50 ' over-promising ' : a 1994 memo released friday shows a @entity1 aide encouraging the president to drop from his @entity54 address a line promising @entity15 they could keep their health care plans and their doctors in his 1994 @entity54 address , @entity1 promised @entity15 ' the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor ' -- 13 years before @entity9 made nearly identical pledges the memo was part of more than 4,000 pages of documents released by the @entity69 , and offers new insights into the development – and ' sale ' to @entity73 – of the ill - fated @entity46 program that represented a major public embarrassment for then - first lady @entity76			1
' is n’t the whole thrust of our health plan to steer people toward cheaper , hmo - style providers ? ' wrote the memo 's author , identified only as @entity84			2
' it ’s one thing to say we ’ll preserve your option to pick the doctor of your choice ( recognizing that this will cost more ) , it ’s quite another to appear to promise the nation that everyone will get to pick the doctor of his or her choice , ' he added			0
' and that ’s exactly what this line does			0
' @entity9 drew fire in 2013 for repeatedly promising that under the @entity50 , now law , ' if you like your health care plan , you can keep your health care plan , ' and ' if you like your doctor , you can keep your doctor			1
' but horror stories have emerged , marginalized by senate majority leader @entity110 and other @entity111 as ' false ' and ' phony , ' demonstrating that significant numbers of @entity15 have lost the breadth of medical choices they once had			0
@entity116 , a project of the @entity118 , designated @entity9 's version of the @entity1 - era promise as its ' @entity121 ' in december			1
in 1994 , however , president @entity1 made the same pledge			2
' this is a tax , a hefty tax ' : @entity1 adviser @entity126 warned the boss that he could go down in history as the author of ' $ 40 billion in new taxes ' if @entity46 was n't spun deftly enough tip of the iceberg : archivists at the @entity135 in @entity136 , @entity133 has at least 78 million pages of paper files and 23 million emails from the 1993 - 2001 administration , and released fewer than 5,000 pages on friday no ' decrease in their premiums ' : hillarycare crafters knew ahead of time that it would be impossible to give policyholders a price break even though government would be collecting an extra $ 40 billion from insurance companies his wife had already reassured @entity155 members of @entity73 , in an effort to bring them on board with her signature law , that the @entity44 's plan would not increase the cost of health care			1
' one of the objectives that the president directed us to pursue from the very beginning was , how did we make this a financial benefit for the majority of @entity15 who are already insured ? ' she told @entity155 leaders on @entity172 in september 1993 , just eight months after becoming first lady			0
' there is no way we could good in conscience go to the @entity15 public and present a plan that would either [ sic ] alter their expectations about what the system looks like , while at the same time increasing their costs and perhaps not providing the kind of security that they need and they should be able to rely on			0
' yet while the first lady was arm - twisting on @entity172 with promises that costs would come to heel , @entity44 senior staffers were hoisting red flags			2
' it is important to note that people and businesses will not see a decrease in their premiums , despite the compression of system costs , ' two aides wrote to @entity1 adviser @entity126 , then the @entity44 's health care policy quarterback			1
many of the same issues that have made @entity50 a practical minefield , it turns out , came up 20 years ago			1
good old days : @entity46 was a serious but failed effort to redesign the @entity15 health care system , years before the @entity210 sex scandal sucked all the oxygen out of @entity1 's presidency leveraging heroes : @entity214 , a @entity76 aide who now works in the @entity9 @entity44 , acknowledged that it was important to get veterans on board in order to scare @entity155 from voting ' no ' on @entity46 the principal difference between @entity46 and @entity50 was that the former relied on squeezing funds out of insurance companies , while the latter requires individuals and employers to buy their products			1
@entity126 candidly admitted in one strategy memo that ' this is a tax , a hefty tax , which will , it seems to us , provide at least 2/3 of the revenue for your access fund			2
' the @entity15 @entity233 ruled that @entity50 's financial penalties on @entity15 who do n't buy insurance were , too , ' taxes			0
' another revelation came in an early memo from @entity1 – and now @entity9 – adviser @entity214			2
he wrote to the first lady just two months into her tenure that she would have to court the support of veterans for whatever health reform proposal she chose to undertake			0
' one extraordinarily important political goal of any health reform proposal , ' he advised in march 1993 , ' is to design it in such a way that a vote against the @entity1 health reform initiative is a vote against veterans			0
' another adviser set out advice that @entity9 might have found helpful : ' it is important for us to avoid the perception tha twe will be placing all the burdens on businesses ; along these lines , please try to avoid the word mandate			0
' the @entity261 in @entity133 released more than 4,000 pages of documents from the 1993 - 2001 @entity264 , including a series of bombshell revelations			1
hillarycare : technology : @entity269 : @entity270 : doodles : @entity272 : do n't use the word ' mandate , ' advisers counseled , so @entity15 would believe everyone was an equal stakeholder in the health care reform process the @entity261 is sitting on nearly 100 million documents , but has released just a fraction 13 years after the @entity43 left @entity281			1

@entity1 's aides *cautioned* against *overpromising* in the same way @entity9 later did
he promised ' the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor ' in his 1994 @entity54 , but ' @entity46 ' did n't survive
one adviser conceded that the plan amounted to ' a hefty tax '
while @entity76 romanced *congressional* *republicans* with promises that health care costs would n't go up , advisers knew no one would save money
new documents released friday by the @entity261 in @entity136 , @entity133 provide new insights into the @entity44 20 years ago
