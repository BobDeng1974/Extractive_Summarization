by @entity0 for @entity1 the number of parents who can correctly identify their children as overweight or obese has fallen over the past two decades obesity is skewing the way we view those who are overweight - and could be wreaking havoc on children 's health , a study has warned			1
new research has revealed that between 1988 and 2010 , the number of parents who could correctly identify their children as overweight or obese went down			1
and the increasing trend of weight underestimation is extremely alarming , the researchers caution			1
' today , almost one out of every three children is overweight or obese , ' said senior author dr @entity20 of @entity21			0
' they are at significantly increased risk of a number of diseases as they grow older , including diabetes , cardiovascular disease , osteoarthritis and cancer			0
' and the first step to dealing with any problem is being aware of it , he told @entity34			0
dr @entity20 and his team examined height and weight data on 2,871 children - aged between six and 11 - from the 1988 to 1994 @entity40 in the @entity41 then they assessed 3,202 similar youngsters from the 2005 to 2010 cycles of the survey			1
in all cases , the children ’s parents were asked if they considered their child ‘ overweight , underweight , just about the right weight , or do n’t know '			1
in the 1988 to 1994 data set , 78 per cent of parents of an overweight boy and 61 per cent of parents of an overweight girl , wrongly identified the child as ‘ about the right weight			1
’ that number increased to 83 per cent for boys and 78 per cent for girls in the 2005 to 2010 period			1
similarly , for obese boys , 26 per cent of parents said they were ‘ about the right weight ’ in 1988			1
this is compared to 37 per cent in 2010 , according to the results , published in the journal @entity66			2
like their parents , many children also identify themselves as about the right weight even if they are overweight or obese			2
and these youngsters are also less likely to try to lose weight			0
commenting on the new findings , dr @entity20 said : ' studies overwhelmingly show that parental perceptions of their child ’s weight influence family readiness to foster healthy behaviours			2
' increasingly underestimating puts more kids at the risk of becoming overweight or obese			0
' one reason for it might be that parental perceptions might be changing over time as obesity becomes more common , since people generally judge themselves ( and their children ) against the people around them			0
it 's also possible that more parents are unwilling to admit their children are overweight due to the increasing stigma of obesity , said dr @entity20			2
experts say part of the problem is that parents are also overweight - so they do n't see the extent of their child 's weight problem other studies have shown that overweight adults are increasingly not perceiving themselves as overweight , said @entity99 , a senior economist in the research department of the @entity101 , who was not involved in the study			1
the misclassification rate was quite high for both time periods , she points out			0
' for six to 11 year old children , a lot of parents could say " i ’m waiting to make a pronouncement because kids are always changing - and they grow out of it " , ' she said			2
' and " about the right weight " could reasonably include some kids who are slightly overweight but close to the healthy weight category			0
' it is the misperception that a child is not obese that 's important , she stressed			0
and though it seems logical that parents who more accurately perceive their kids ’ weight will be more ready to try to change an overweight child ’s behavior , it may not be that simple , she said			1
' it ’s not clear that if a doctor hammers home that a child is overweight , the parent will have more readiness to help child engage in more healthful behaviors			0
' do you really need to change parental perception first ? it may be more effective to promote healthier behaviors among all kids			0

@entity41 researchers looked at data from 1988 - 1994 and 2005 - 2010
more parents in the earlier date range were able to tell if a child was *fat*
increasing trend of weight underestimation is ' extremely alarming '
