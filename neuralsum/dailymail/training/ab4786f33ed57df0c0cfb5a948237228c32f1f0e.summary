president @entity0 has sent a special unit of @entity3 officers to the @entity4 to investigate @entity4 @entity6 extremists amid growing fears in @entity8 that we are becoming a ‘ breeding ground ’ for terrorism			1
in a pointed snub to @entity14 , the agents arrived on a ‘ lone wolf ’ mission to interrogate senior security experts about the radicalisation of @entity4 muslims			1
the mission has been revealed as our security services have been forced to admit they are struggling to keep track of the estimated 500 @entity4 who have travelled to the @entity23 to fight alongside the @entity25 forces in @entity26 and @entity27			2
snub : @entity0 has sent a special unit of @entity3 officers to the @entity4 to investigate @entity4 @entity6 extremists it is unusual for the @entity3 to send a team to the @entity4 : the agency usually relies on information passed to it by @entity14 or @entity33 or by its agents stationed at the @entity35 in @entity36			1
sources have told @entity38 that the agents were keen to establish the ‘ stability ’ of the relationship between the @entity43 and @entity44 branches of @entity18 in the @entity4			1
the fighters going out to join @entity25 have been @entity4 - based @entity43 , causing deepening tensions within the community			0
professor @entity48 , of the @entity49 at @entity50 , said the mission , which took place earlier this year , showed the level of concern in @entity8 over the issue , which he claimed was rooted in the @entity4 ’s ‘ lax ’ immigration policies			0
‘ the @entity57 is worried about the @entity4 situation			1
they fear there might be a knock - on effect for them , ’ prof @entity48 said			0
‘ the throat - cutting between @entity43 and @entity44 in @entity27 and @entity26 has not yet spread to the @entity4 , but it is a real threat			0
it is conceivable you could see @entity44 “ hit squads ” in @entity4 targeting @entity43 preparing to go out to the conflict zones to fight			0
’ he said : ‘ the @entity57 regard the @entity4 as a disaster because of our lax stance on immigration which has allowed this militancy to take hold			2
radicalised : former promising @entity77 students @entity78 ( left ) and @entity79 ( right ) in an @entity25 video ‘ frankly , they would not be doing their jobs properly if it did not do this – forming an objective view of the situation outside of the reports they get from @entity14 and their officers at the @entity35 in @entity36			0
’ last night a source at the @entity3 insisted @entity4 intelligence had been informed of ‘ all outside contacts ’ the agents made in the @entity4			2
however , the sources also admitted that the move revealed a growing lack of trust in @entity8 over @entity14 and @entity33 ’s ability to provide a reliable assessment of the security threat presented by young @entity18 under the sway of imams who are radicalised and then recruited to fight in religious wars around the globe			0
the @entity0 administration has become increasingly anxious that young @entity57 muslims could follow the same pattern			1
there are strong links between @entity4 and @entity57 radicals and the sources say the @entity3 feels @entity4 efforts to identify and unmask them have been inadequate			1
a @entity3 and a @entity113 spokesman declined to comment .			0

sources said @entity57 agents want to assess stability of @entity6 relations in @entity4
normally @entity0 relies on intelligence passed *directly* from the @entity4
but fears have *ramped* up after recent radicalisation of young @entity4
