a man who survived a suicide leap from the @entity2 has told in detail how he was saved by a sea lion which kept him afloat until the coastguard arrived			1
@entity6 is now a global speaker on mental health issues and shared his remarkable story at a suicide prevention conference in @entity10 , @entity11			1
aged just 21 , he was suffering from bipolar disorder and psychosis when he jumped from the @entity15 landmark on a chilly september day in 2000			2
but immediately after the four - second fall there was another , more incredible miracle			2
he told the @entity26 : ' i guess you would call it a mammal began swimming beneath me and i 'm thinking , " oh man , a shark is about to devour me "			0
' i was on a show for suicide prevention and i mentioned that i thought there was this shark on this show and a man wrote into the show and he said , " @entity6 , i 'm so very glad you 're alive , i was less than two feet away from you when you jumped "			1
' he said : " it haunted me until this day ; it was no shark , it was a sea lion and the people above looking down believed it to be keeping you afloat until the coast guard brought a ride behind you			1
" ' landmark : by a stroke of luck , a witness saw mr @entity6 jump from the vast bridge and alerted the coastguard conference : mr @entity6 spoke at the @entity56 conference in @entity57 , @entity11			1
the force attended nearly 50,000 mental health incidents last year with temperatures in the bay 's waters as low as @entity63 , mr @entity6 could have died of hypothermia had a witness not seen him jump and raised the alarm			1
mr @entity6 said he never intended to tell his story because he was ' embarrassed ' , but changed his mind after a life - affirming talk to 120 students , many of whom had suicidal thoughts			1
now he has written a book about his experience , @entity76 , @entity77 , and appears at conferences all over the world			0
with medication and professional help he has managed to reduce his symptoms , including the voices in his head which told him to jump on that day 14 and a half years ago			0
' the message is very very simple , ' he told @entity26			0
' you do n't have to die this way			0
' mr @entity6 says he is one of just 34 survivors of falls from the @entity2 , which rises high above the @entity90 , and the only one to become a mental health campaigner			1
population : sea lions basking on piers in @entity15			0
mr @entity6 said the theory was perfectly plausible he spoke yesterday as part of the @entity98 conference in @entity57			2
the force attended almost 50,000 mental health incidents in 2014 alone , and set up to conference to discuss how the often - misunderstood issue should be tackled			1
mr @entity6 had talked about being saved by a sea lion before , including in a 2013 blog post			1
' there are a large number of reporters and speculators who have claimed it was really a seal , and even those who have claimed that there was nothing but me in that water , ' he wrote			0
' however , i know that it was a sea lion and it is not a statistic anomaly			2
marine animals ( dolphins , sea lions ) and other creatures have helped save humans and other animals from dangerous situations all over the world			0
' i say believe it or do n’t , that ’s completely up to you			0
i know the truth , and in this case and that is all that matters			0
