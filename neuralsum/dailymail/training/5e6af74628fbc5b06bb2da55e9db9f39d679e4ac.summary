by @entity0 published : 11:28 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 7 november 2013 locked in an embrace for more than 165 million years , what 's thought to be the oldest fossilised evidence of two insects having sex has been discovered in @entity6			1
researchers believe the pair were halfway through mating when they were killed by toxic gases released by a volcanic eruption			2
they were then blown by the wind into a lake where they were buried , and ultimately protected , for millions of years			2
the team from @entity16 in @entity6 uncovered the intact specimen in the region of @entity19 in @entity20			2
researchers from @entity6 found the preserved specimen under sediment in the @entity19 region of @entity20			1
the bugs are still interlocked and both sets of genitals can be clearly seen			0
the face - to - face mating ritual of the fossilised insects is similar to that seen in modern - day froghopper insects			1
modern - day froghoppers traditionally mate belly - to - belly while holding onto a twig			0
they also mate side - by - side if having sex on a leaf or tree trunk			0
the stomach of the fossilised male is twisted to make inserting his sex organ easier , and this is common in modern - day insect species , including the froghoppers			2
the insects discovered are members of the @entity48 species			0
they were found face - to - face and the male sex organ is seen inserted inside the female			1
the holotype male was found on the right , with the allotype female , on the left			2
study co-author @entity56 said fossils of copulating insects are rare - only 40 have ever been found worldwide - yet this latest discovery predates the oldest known fossil by around 65 million years			1

modern - day froghoppers traditionally mate facing each other while holding onto a twig			0
they also mate side - by - side , pictured , if having sex on a leaf or tree trunk ‘ we found these two very rare copulating froghoppers which provide a glimpse of interesting insect behaviour and important data to understand their mating position and genitalia orientation during the @entity102 , ’ said study author @entity94			1
‘ it is the earliest record of copulating insects to date , and suggests that froghoppers ' genital symmetry and mating position have remained static for over 165 million years			1
’ because fossil records of mating insects are so rare , little is known about mating rituals and the anatomical position of genitalia especially during the early stages of evolution			0
this discovery will help expand this knowledge			0
the team examined more than 1200 specimens from the locality of @entity19 , @entity6 , pictured			0
the area , and in particular the fossil - rich @entity122 , is said to be part of the @entity19 - a rock formation believed to date back to the middle - late @entity126 period the team examined more than 1200 specimens from the locality of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity6			1

the formation is believed to date back to the middle - late @entity126 period			1
ren and @entity56 ’s findings are published in the journal @entity134 .			0

the insect couple were found in sediment in a lake in @entity20
found face - to - face , the male and female sex organs are clearly *visible*
researchers believe the insects date back around 165 million years *ago*
their mating ritual is similar to that seen in froghopper insects today
