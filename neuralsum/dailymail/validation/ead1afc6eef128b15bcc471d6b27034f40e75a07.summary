he was sacked for punching a junior tv producer after not getting a hot dinner			2
and judging by the extensive list of backstage luxuries demanded by @entity6 and his top gear live co presenters , it seems a miracle he had n’t previously lashed out			1
the three - page catalogue was revealed after @entity11 producer @entity10 , who felt @entity6 ’s wrath , said he did not want to press charges			1
also required is @entity22 rosé or equivalent which – at @entity6 ’s insistence - must be ‘ pale dry … preferably southern @entity26			1
’ in case that runs out , they ask for two dozen bottles of @entity31 beer , @entity33 gin plus tonic , ice and lemon , all chilled in a fridge or cooler cabinet with at least four shelves			1
their drinks must be served on linen covered tables , while a sofa must be provided with ‘ enough room to seat six people , one of whom is 6ft 3in and likes to lie down ’			1
the stars also insist on a @entity52 coffee machine with a milk frothing gadget , balsamic vinegar , @entity57 deodorant , hair wax , ‘ nice rubbish bins ’ and a coat stand – ‘ not a rail ! ’ in all , there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which @entity6 , @entity65 and @entity66 may use to relax in during breaks from hosting the @entity69 live events , which take place at arenas in the @entity72 and abroad , and are separate from the @entity11 tv show			1
the rooms – often the size of a hotel suite – must be fitted with a rug if there are no carpets , soft lighting , a tv with good speaker system and @entity83 and movies , an array of films on dvd and green plants - ideally bamboo			2
@entity90 insists on a carton of @entity92 and as well as packets of @entity94 and @entity95			2
in all , there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which @entity6 , @entity65 and @entity66 may use to relax in during breaks from hosting the @entity69 live events and in a move which might have pre-empted the attack that ended @entity6 ’s @entity11 career , the list also insists the green room must be located near a @entity104 , stating : ‘ they will ask for this ’			1
a source from @entity108 told the @entity109 : ‘ all three presenters have their eclectic tastes and they certainly know what they want			1
‘ @entity6 is very into his rosé and very particular about getting exactly the right type of wine			1
‘ he also likes to be driven around in a @entity116 during these events			2
‘ it ’s fair to say he can be a little bit of a @entity120 at times			0
’ @entity6 is alleged to have been drinking @entity121 for three hours before he hit tv producer @entity10 , who had told him that he was n’t able to have steak and chips at @entity124 in @entity125 following a day ’s filming			1
two planned @entity69 live events for this weekend in @entity128 were postponed after the 54 - year - old presenter was suspended and later fired over the fracas			2

the source added : ‘ some of the items are brought over by his team from venue to venue around the globe but others they get people on the ground to buy ready for their arrival			0
‘ they do n’t always need everything or eat and drink everything on the list , but they like to have them there just in case			2
’ the green rooms vary in size depending on the venue , but are often the equivalent of a hotel suite			0
during most @entity108 events the presenters – and anyone they invite to join them – spend a few hours in the room during rehearsals on friday and before and after shows on saturday and sundays			1
they usually stay in hotels or private houses overnight			0
the rider was put together by pr firm @entity252 and events , which worked on the @entity108 shows			1
one of the firm ’s directors , @entity257 , was unavailable for comment , while another , @entity260 , declined to answer questions at her @entity263 home when she was shown the document			0
but a former business associate of the pair , who did not wish to be named , said : ‘ i know there were lists like this for @entity69 with very specific requests			0
’ @entity10 ’s solicitor , @entity273 , indicated the producer wanted to draw a line under the affair			0
mr @entity273 said : ‘ mr @entity10 does n’t want to press charges			0
