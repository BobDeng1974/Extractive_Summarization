by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 16 march 2013 a man who went to his gp with a stomach upset has told how doctors removed part of his bowel after wrongly diagnosing cancer			1
@entity8 was left having to wear a colostomy bag and was not even told of the disastrous cancer mistake until he returned to hospital for a check - up			1
a surgeon told him : ‘ i ’ve got some good news for you			0
you have n’t got cancer after all			2
’ suffered : widower @entity8 , 69 , endured ' wholly unnecessary ' surgery to remove part of his bowel after he was wrongly told by doctors that he had cancer when the retired bus driver , who had previously enjoyed good health , expressed his astonishment , the consultant said : ‘ better safe than sorry			1
’ the @entity24 has seen a confidential report which exposes a catalogue of incompetence and failure of leadership at the @entity30 in @entity31 , where mr @entity8 was treated			1
in one of the most glaring mistakes , the phrase ‘ no dysplasia ’ – referring to an absence of abnormal cells on an ulcer found in mr @entity8 ’s body – was read at a case conference as ‘ dysplasia ’			1
the omission of the word ‘ no ’ led doctors to believe cancer was likely and on that basis they went ahead with the operation			2
the document also reveals that : mr @entity8 is to receive £ 60,000 compensation from @entity51 after his negligence claim was settled out of court			1
the sequence of events began when the 69 - year - old widower , from @entity57 , went to his gp after a bout of diarrhoea			2
he was referred to the @entity30 where he underwent a series of tests and was told that a tumour had been found in his colon			0
in november 2011 surgeons removed part of his bowel and he spent two weeks in hospital recovering from the operation , which left him needing to use a colostomy bag			1
he moved in with his son and , when he eventually returned home , became a virtual recluse , too embarrassed to see friends and family			0
mr @entity8 said : ‘ i changed my lifestyle and did n’t see anyone			2
i would not leave the house as the bag would tend to burst on me			0
i had to change it at home which made me very sick and it was very inconvenient			0
i was in good health until all this happened			0
’ glaring errors : the @entity30 in @entity31 have agreed to pay mr @entity8 £ 60,000 after his negligence claim was settled out of court he had another operation to repair the colon and remove the colostomy bag but this still left him with major problems with everyday life			1
‘ i completely lost my appetite and over a stone in weight			0
physically and psychologically i did not feel like myself , ’ he said			0
it was only when he returned to the @entity30 for a routine check - up that he was told his suffering had been entirely unnecessary because the cancer diagnosis had been wrong			1
trust chief executive @entity102 has now written to him , apologising for the substandard care			0
mr @entity8 ’s solicitor , @entity104 , of law firm @entity105 , said : ‘ as a result of an appalling clinical error mr @entity8 was subjected to extremely invasive and wholly unnecessary surgery			1
' while no amount of money will turn the clock back , the settlement does in part recompense him for all the unnecessary pain and suffering he has endured and will continue to live with			0
’ @entity116 , chief executive of the @entity117 , said : ‘ patients deserve to feel confident that their prescribed course of treatment is clinically right			0
‘ trusts need to ensure their procedures prevent avoidable surgery which can have devastating long - terms impacts on the quality of patients ’ lives			2
