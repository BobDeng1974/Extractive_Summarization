as interplanetary exploration goes , it could be a first			0
not content with sending rovers to @entity4 , scientists have revealed an ambitious plan to send a boat to @entity7 , @entity9 's largest moon			1
engineers who unveiled their proposal at the @entity12 today with a selection of potential craft powered by wheels , paddles and even a screw			2
@entity9 and its largest moon , @entity7			1
researchers hope to send a boat to the liquid gas lakes on the moon 's surface			1
@entity7 is one of the most @entity26 - like bodies in the @entity27			1
with a thick atmosphere , a diameter between that of @entity26 and the planet @entity31 , and a network of seas , lakes and rivers , it is in many respects more like a planet than a moon like the @entity26 ’s			1
the @entity41 , which studied @entity7 extensively in the 2000s , confirmed that lakes , seas and rivers of liquid hydrocarbons ( similar to household gas ) exist , covering much of the satellite ’s northern hemisphere			1
although it eventually landed on solid ground , the @entity51 lander was designed to be able to float for a short period			0
the new plans , called the @entity55 , proposes a boat - probe , propelled by wheels , paddles or screws			2
the probe would land in the middle of @entity62 ( the biggest lake , near @entity7 ’s north pole ) , then set sail for the coast , taking scientific measurements along the way			2
the mission would last around six months to a year			0

the sea on @entity7 is believed to be 100,000 square kilometers , larger than @entity71 ( 82,000 square kilometers )			2
' the main innovation in @entity55 is the propulsion system , ' said @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , a member of the team developing the idea			0
' this allows the probe to move , under control , from the landing site in the lake , to the closest shore			0
' the displacement capability would achieve the obtaining of liquid and solid samples from several scientific interesting locations on @entity7 's surface such as the landing place , along the route towards the shore and finally at the shoreline			1
' @entity7 is one of the most @entity26 - like bodies in the @entity27			2
with a thick atmosphere , a diameter between that of @entity26 and the planet @entity31 , and a network of seas , lakes and rivers , it is in many respects more like a planet than a moon like the @entity26 ’s			1

researchers believe @entity7 's environment is too cold for life as we know it , but its environment , rich in the building blocks of life , is of great interest to astrobiologists			1
the satellite 's atmosphere is made up largely of nitrogen ( like @entity26 ’s ) , and is rich in organic compounds and hydrogen cyanide , which may have played a role in the emergence of life on @entity26			0
the @entity55 concept is being developed as a partnership between @entity77 , a private engineering and technology group , and the @entity131 in @entity132 , @entity133			0
this rendering of the proposed @entity55 probe shows one possible means of propulsion : screws on either side of the probe			0
a prototype using wheels is also being developed			0
a third version using paddles is being considered by the team .			0

plans would send a craft sailing through @entity7 's seas , lakes and rivers of liquid gas
@entity154 would last for upto a year
