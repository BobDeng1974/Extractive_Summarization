by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:19 pm on 19th july 2011 @entity2 was killed in a @entity4 attack on his home in @entity6 a close adviser to @entity9 's president @entity8 has been killed by gunmen strapped with explosives			1
@entity2 , who assisted @entity8 with tribal issues , as well as parliamentarian @entity13 , were killed in the brazen late - night attack on @entity2 's home in western @entity6			1
security forces quickly killed one of the assailants , but the second attacker barricaded himself inside the house and battled police outside			2
the crackle of gunfire and small explosions finally ended about 3 am on monday morning and reporters on the scene saw a body - presumably that of the final attacker - dragged out of the house on a plastic sheet			0
one police officer also was killed , according to the @entity32			2
the assassination threw a pall over two events marking the shift to the next phase of the @entity9 conflict - the transfer of an entire province to @entity9 security control on sunday and monday 's transfer of authority for @entity45 and @entity46 forces from gen. @entity47 to lt. gen. @entity48			2
the killing of @entity2 , which the @entity4 claimed responsibility for , is the second high - profile assassination in @entity9 in less than a week			1
@entity53 , the president 's half - brother and one of the most powerful men in southern @entity9 , was gunned down last week by a close associate			1
the attack on @entity2 began sunday evening when two men wearing suicide bomb vests and armed with guns knocked at a side door at @entity2 's home in western @entity6 and then , when a man who worked at the house opened the gate , punched him and pushed past him into the residence , said @entity68 , the man who opened the door			1
' then the shooting started , ' @entity68 said			0
it was not immediately clear whether there had been armed guards outside the door			0
a relative who was inside the house said the attackers went straight for the room where @entity2 and @entity13 , a lawmaker from @entity80 province , were talking			0
@entity9 police keep watch outside the house where the attack began to unfold on sunday evening the body of a @entity4 insurgent is driven away from the scene of the assassination ' they went in there with their guns and started shooting and just killed them , ' said @entity92 , a young man who spoke through tears and only gave one name			1
defence department officials confirmed the deaths			0
@entity2 was governor of the @entity97 - dominated @entity80 in the south from 2002 until march 2006 and has remained influential in the area			0
though he was often labeled a warlord and a thug by the international community , presidential spokesman @entity100 said @entity8 considered him a key partner in the south and a bulwark against the @entity4			1
' @entity2 was one of the most influential leaders in the south , especially in @entity80 , ' @entity100 said			0
as an example of @entity8 's trust in @entity2 , @entity100 explained a tribal dispute the adviser helped calm			2
broken windows bear evidence of the gun battle which killed the two men ' only two months ago , @entity2 resolved a huge dispute between the @entity118 in @entity80 and one of the @entity97 tribes			2
the president said , ' @entity2 was the only one who can resolve that problem because both sides respect him , '' @entity100 recalled			2
he said @entity8 would not have removed @entity2 as governor except for pressure from the international community , which wrongly accused him of criminal activity			0
' he was one of the most hard - line opponents and enemies of the @entity4 , ' @entity128 was unclear how influential @entity2 was with @entity8 , but he was thought to wield considerable influence in @entity80			1
@entity4 spokesman @entity132 claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the insurgent group			1
@entity53 ( left ) was killed in a gun attack last week			1
he was the half - brother of president @entity8 ( right ) @entity132 said the @entity4 killed @entity2 because he was assisting coalition forces in carrying out night raids against @entity9			1
the controversial raids have been highly effective in capturing or killing hundreds of @entity4 fighters and midlevel commanders			1
@entity8 has complained the operations anger many @entity9 who are mistakenly targeted			0
' he was cooperating and helping the @entity46 forces , ' @entity132 said in an emailed statement			0
the @entity4 had also claimed responsibility for tuesday 's killing of @entity8 's half - brother , who was shot dead by a close associate			1
@entity53 's death left the president without an influential ally to balance the interests of the southern region 's tribal and political leaders , drug runners , insurgents and militias			1
sunday 's violence marred the handover of control of a peaceful province in the center of the country to @entity9 police , another step in a transition that will allow foreign troops to withdraw in full by the end of 2014			0
the weeping president , centre , attends the burial of his half - brother in his family 's ancestral village of @entity176 , in @entity178 province , @entity9 , last week bamiyan province is one of seven areas going to @entity9 security control this month in a first round of the transition			1
another , @entity186 province in the east , began being transferred earlier this month			0
both places have seen little to no fighting since the overthrow of the @entity4 nearly 10 years ago and barely had any coalition troop presence			1
@entity192 only had a small foreign troop contingent from @entity194			0
@entity192 and @entity186 are the only two provinces that will be handed over in their entirety during this month 's transition phase			0
other areas to be handed over are the provincial capitals of @entity201 in southern @entity9 , @entity202 in the west , @entity204 in the north and @entity206 in the east			0
@entity9 forces will also take control of all of @entity6 province except for the restive @entity212 district			1
but recent attacks in the capital have served as a reminder of how much @entity9 forces still depend on international help in @entity6			2
@entity194 special forces were called in to help with sunday night 's attack , @entity194 prime minister @entity218 said in a press conference monday			2
he said the @entity194 troops began in a mentoring role but then shifted into an ' operational ' combat role as the attack unfolded			0
@entity218 declined to give further details of what happened			0
it 's the second time in three weeks that the @entity229 ( @entity230 ) , which is in @entity9 primarily to mentor @entity9 security forces , has become actively involved in active combat			0
the @entity230 was also involved in countering insurgents who attacked the @entity234 in @entity6 on june 29 .			2

attack comes one week after president 's brother was gunned down
another parliamentarian also killed in the @entity6 raid
@entity4 claim responsibility for both assassinations
