almost two years ago , @entity0 fought on the undercard of @entity3 's ill - fated comeback in @entity4			2
standing in the way of a world title shot against @entity7 was @entity8 , an unbeaten but limited @entity9			1
in the end , the 27 - year - old offered little resistance , going down in the first and sixth rounds before the fight was stopped before it reached the halfway point			0
@entity0 goes through his final preparations for saturday 's fight in @entity18 now @entity0 , who went on to lose narrowly to @entity7 in @entity19 airies the following april , is in a similar position			1
this time the prize on the table is a shot at the much - feared and much - avoided world champion @entity24			1
in @entity18 on saturday night , @entity0 faces @entity25 in the final fight of his current deal with @entity30 - based promoter @entity28			1
the @entity31 , who brings a record of 39 victories from 44 contests , is as wily as he is tough and will be no gim me for the @entity38 man			0
stopped just once by recent @entity24 victim @entity39 , @entity25 is awkward , even underhand at times , but has promised he is in the principality to win			1
‘ he ’s experienced , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ his style is horrible and awkward but it works for him			0
you look at videos of him and think he looks very beatable			0
he looks like he ’s got nothing about him			0
the venue in @entity18 for @entity0 's middleweight bout against @entity25 ‘ but then you look at his record and look at the people he has fought and beat and you start to realise that he makes his style work for him			1
’ @entity25 took former world champion @entity52 the 12 - round distance three years ago in a @entity55 title fight and did the same to @entity56 in their two battles			1
@entity0 will know , however , that if he ca n’t navigate a way past the veteran , he has no right to share a ring with @entity24			2
the @entity63 will be ringside at the @entity64 following his 18th consecutive stoppage victory over @entity39 in @entity66 last weekend			0
and he is penciled in to return to @entity67 on february 21 for what will be his third visit			2
‘ people talk about @entity24 and you ’ve got to answer questions about it , but the more people i get asking me about it , the more i get motivated to do a proper job on @entity25 this saturday night , ’ said @entity0			1
@entity0 must navigate a way past the veteran @entity25 if he is to secure a shot at @entity24 ( left ) ‘ i knew i had a world title shot against @entity7 back in 2013 , but i still had to go out there and beat @entity8 to get it			1
it ’s the same on saturday			2
if i do n’t beat @entity25 , there ’s no world title fight			1
‘ for that reason , i ’m completely focused on @entity25 and am not thinking about @entity24 one bit			2
in fact , i did n’t even watch his fight against @entity39 at the weekend			0
i just completely ignored it			0
instead , i stuck on a dvd of @entity25 that morning to keep me focused			2
’ @entity0 ’s defeat to @entity7 was his second unsuccessful world title challenge following his contentious draw with @entity94 in 2011			1
the 32 - year - old middleweight fought just four times over the following two years , eventually breaking ties with @entity3 to sign a seven - figure , three - fight deal with @entity28			0
a stoppage win over @entity100 and a wide points win over @entity102 have helped build much - needed momentum			0
‘ i would n’t have been ready for a world title shot this year , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ but i feel like i ’m just getting into my prime and i can beat any middleweight in the world			0
’ first , he must take care of @entity25			0
for now , @entity24 can wait .			0

@entity0 takes on @entity25 in @entity18 on saturday night
@entity111 should set up a world title shot against @entity24
@entity24 will be ringside in @entity67 ahead of a possible fight in february
it would be @entity0 ’s third world title shot , having drawn one and lost one
