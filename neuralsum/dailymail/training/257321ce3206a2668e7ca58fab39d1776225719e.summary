by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was the beginning of april and @entity3 , riding on the crest of a wave after a run of victories , were preparing for their biggest challenge of the season			1
@entity12 were due in town and as @entity14 spoke about the problems he anticipated from the side who were going head - to - head for the final @entity20 place , the conversation slowly turned to @entity21 and managerial longevity			2
@entity21 was in the middle of arguably the most testing spell of his tenure , while @entity14 was being feted for transforming @entity3 ’s fortunes			1
having been linked with a number of positions , @entity14 was asked how it felt to see his stock rise so much and whether that made him feel secure			2
secure : @entity3 manager @entity14 at @entity34 ' @entity33 training before his contract extension - a five - year deal worth £ 3m a year - was announced his reply was laced with realism			1
‘ if i could control it i would love to start a project and develop it until you see you ca n’t take it any further , ’ said @entity14			2
‘ unfortunately in the modern game you ca n’t talk about that			0
you ’ve seen sir @entity46 have 27 years and @entity21 but you do n’t see that sort of profile			0
‘ i think ( that profile ) is the success model in the game ( but ) there are too many influences nowadays			0
you ’re always three defeats away from a sacking			2
in the modern game you would love to say if you do well you want to stay here as long as you can but you do n’t know what is happening			0
’ for all that @entity14 was being pragmatic , the reality was different			0
if he was to lose three games on the spin , his theory would not be tested as @entity63 would n’t contemplate jettisoning him ; @entity3 ’s chairman and the board of directors know they have an impressive figure at the helm			1
it is why , in what promises to be a summer of new deals at @entity71 , @entity14 was handed new , lucrative terms after leading @entity3 back into @entity73 with a club @entity75 record of 72 points on the back of some outstanding displays , such as the 3 - 0 dismantling of @entity12			1
model of success : @entity21 's been in charge at @entity12 since 1996 , a rare feat in modern football challenge accepted : @entity3 loan star @entity86 scores in their 3 - 0 win over @entity12 in april elated : @entity3 pushed @entity12 for the final @entity20 place but will contest the next @entity91 ‘ @entity14 undertakes his business with great style , confidence , positivity and class , ’ said @entity63 , when announcing @entity14 ’s new five - year contract			1
‘ he is an @entity3 man			0
there is no magical ingredient to what we do at @entity3			0
‘ we are a football club and recognise the fundamental importance of our manager			0
when we find our man , we empower him			0
we support and provide him with everything at our disposal			0
we commit to our managers , and we ’re immensely pleased that @entity14 has committed to us			2
’ as @entity109 explained , taking over from @entity110 was not easy but @entity14 ’s relentless positivity , his unfailing optimism and unshakable belief in his methods have catapulted @entity3 forward and will be crucial in maintaining progress			1
happy camp : @entity14 is committed to his project at @entity3 and chairman @entity63 is delighted with his work big shoes : @entity63 says replacing @entity110 was a tough task but his @entity123 manager has flourished some would accuse @entity14 of naivety in thinking @entity3 will be able to keep their place in the top five but he , for instance , would look at @entity129 spending £ 160million on new midfielders over the past 12 months and relish the challenge of trying to find a way to beat them			1
that , of course , is admirable but @entity14 will know those who asked questions of him when he was appointed 53 weeks ago will do so again ahead of the new campaign : how will they juggle the demands of @entity73 ? what if his movement in the transfer market is not as successful ? what @entity14 has in his favour , though , is the unshakable backing of his chairman			2
@entity63 absolutely made the right decision to appoint @entity14 , who describes his support as ' incredible ' and he made the right decision once again to reward his outstanding first 12 months			1
big questions : can @entity14 do the same brilliant business that brought @entity86 to @entity71 on loan ? at home : ideally , @entity14 wants to see his vision through from start to finish , and at @entity3 he may get the rare chance to do that a number of clubs , including @entity161 , would have liked to have taken @entity14 away from @entity71 but he has a vision for @entity3 – some of his plans include building living quarters at the club ’s @entity166 training enclave – and , crucially , a board that want him to see it through			1
‘ we want the best because only the best will do , ’ said @entity63			0
‘ unswervingly , we trust @entity14 to take our club forward			2
to use one of his favourite words we are “ excited ” about our future			0
’ @entity14 may be right in pointing out that the world football managers now inhabit is trigger - happy and can be horribly insecure but @entity3 are an exception to the rule			1
@entity63 wants @entity14 to turn supporters ’ dreams into reality			1
quite simply , he will be able to stay as long as he wants .			0

@entity14 signed a £ 3m - per - year deal with @entity3 to stay there until 2019
he says as a manager ' you ’re always three defeats away from a sacking '
@entity3 finished *2013/14* with a club @entity75 record of 72 points
@entity192 chairman @entity63 has sung his manager 's praises
he says @entity14 operates with ' style , confidence , positivity and class '
