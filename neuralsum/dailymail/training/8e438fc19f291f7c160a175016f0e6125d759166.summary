on cue : dancing can help @entity3 's sufferers with balance and movement dancing the tango or an @entity8 jig may improve symptoms of @entity3			1
new research shows that after dancing twice a week , patients were able to take up physical activities that they had been unable to perform since developing the disease			2
trials are now under way at a number of centres , including the @entity18 , where the effects of dance on the disease are being investigated			2
the 127,000 @entity22 with parkinson ’s disease suffer a progressive loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra			1
this leads to a reduction in levels of a brain chemical called dopamine			2
just what triggers this loss is not known , but is probably down to a combination of genetic and environmental factors			2
dopamine plays a key role in regulating the movement of the body and a drop in levels causes involuntary shaking , muscle stiffness and a slowing down of physical movements			1
there is currently no cure for @entity3 ’s but several treatments are available to help control symptoms			1
turning and walking backwards are among the tasks that sufferers have the most difficulty with			0
in new research at @entity57 , @entity3 ’s patients took part in twice - weekly one - hour sessions of tango dancing			1
results show that by the end of the year - long study , there were significant improvements in their balance and mobility compared with patients who did conventional exercises			0
another study at the @entity71 tracked eye movement during dancing exercises			0
people with @entity3 ’s can have difficulty co-ordinating their eye movements , and researchers believe that the music and movements involved in dancing may help the brain to get around the balance and movement problems			1
a third piece of research , being led by the @entity87 , found that patients who practised traditional @entity8 set dancing – often to referred to as a jig – fell less often and were more mobile after regular set dancing lessons			0
benefits may be down to exercise , the strong rhythm of @entity8 music and the sociability of group dances			0
@entity3 ’s research first turned to set dancing after @entity101 doctor @entity100 had a chance encounter in a @entity104 village			2
treadmill turn - off : researchers found @entity3 's patients were more willing to retain dancing as an exercise compared to traditional gym workouts while attending a traditional music festival , he saw a man walk in with distinct @entity3 ’s symptoms and start dancing in a ‘ fluent ’ way			1
along with @entity114 - based researcher @entity113 , dr @entity100 put 24 patients with @entity3 ’s through weekly set dancing classes for six months			1
when measured against a control group , all of them saw improvement in balance , mobility and quality of life			0
they found it easier to change direction and to start moving again after they had stopped			0
in 20 years of sending patients to the gym , to swimming and to treadmill - based rehabilitation , he said that when it came to dancing , patients were far more willing to continue with the exercise			0
it is suggested that external cues such as music bypass the areas of the brain rendered dysfunctional by the disease and activate other areas involved in movement			0
the movement of the dance partner and the physical contact involved also act as cues			1
co-ordinated steps with partners lead to faster movement , while physical contact improves balance			2
the tango may be particularly useful because it involves rhythmic rocking , or shifting weight from foot to foot – a strategy commonly used to address muscle ‘ freezing ’			0
alongside the @entity163 study , which is also looking at the tango , a second trial is under way at the @entity87 , where @entity8 set dancing is being used			0
@entity3 ’s @entity22 is also looking at the benefits of @entity167 – the @entity169 - inspired dance fitness craze .			1

@entity3 's sees a progressive loss of nerve cells and dopamine
dopamine loss cause involuntary shakes and *struggles* with physical tasks
regular dance classes has been shown to help regain movement control
