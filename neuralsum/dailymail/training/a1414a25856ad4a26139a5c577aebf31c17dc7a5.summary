he today spoke at a prayer ceremony at a supporter camp located near the @entity41 sunday prayer meeting : the showdown pitted @entity4 's claims of ancestral rights to graze his cows on open range against federal claims that the cattle are trespassing on arid and fragile habitat of the endangered desert tortoise but authorities were forced to retreat after his rag - tag militia of armed anti-federalists refused to back down			1

@entity76 disputed @entity55 's contention the agency mishandled the roundup of @entity4 's cattle 80 miles northeast of @entity67			1
