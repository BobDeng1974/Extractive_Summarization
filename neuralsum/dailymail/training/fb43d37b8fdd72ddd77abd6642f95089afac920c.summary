the horrific details of the hazing that forced one @entity3 high school to cancel their football team 's season have finally been revealed			1
a parent of a player in the football program at @entity9 claims that seniors on the team would turn off the lights in the locker room , pin a freshman , stick their finger into the freshman 's rectum and , at times , then put that finger in the young man 's mouth			1

' then , the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum			1
sometimes , the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player â€™s mouth			1
' one official also told @entity50 , ' [ the freshmen ] would live in fear of seniors and juniors			1
they would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there			0
' this was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school			0
superintendent @entity25 said there will be a criminal investigation as there is ' enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment , intimidation and bullying '			1
he added that these incidences took place ' on a pervasive level , on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew , tolerated and in general accepted '			1
' based upon that information , we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman , the junior varsity and varsity football programs , ' @entity79 said			1

no players have been suspended and @entity79 would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired			2
he said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated			2
' this district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say ' no. ' no to bullying , ' he said			2
@entity79 added that in addition to the criminal investigation , the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports			0
speaking to @entity88 @entity87 's radio channel , some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players			1
' the students ca n't play , it 's a ding on the entire community , it 's a ding on the high school , ' one parent whose son is on the team said			1
the @entity133 said it was investigating a report that seniors on the @entity9 football team hazed freshmen in various forms - some of which could be considered sexual assault ' for all of them , the ones who are innocent , to have this taken away from them			1
they 're being punished for something they did not do , ' another parent added			0
a number of commentators on @entity150 seemed to agree i feel bad for those @entity154 players , ' one person wrote			2
' i could n't imagine having something i work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices			0
' but others praised @entity154 's zero tolerance approach to bullying			2
one person wrote : ' i 'm so proud the district took a major stand against bullying			0
' ' was the only choice the program had			0
' people did n't want to listen and thought the sport should win out			0
' @entity9 's football team - which one of @entity3 's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations , meanwhile , police are investigating former assistant coach of the @entity9 football team @entity179 on drug charges			1
