by @entity0 @entity1 is challenging @entity3 's dominance by launching its own cheap international calling app the cost of calling home from abroad has plummeted in recent years thanks to services such as @entity3			1
and prices could be set to fall even lower as @entity1 is challenging the voice - over - ip service ’s dominance with its own low cost international calling app. the @entity15 app is available for @entity17 and @entity18 handsets and offers international calls for as little as two pence a minute			1
holiday makers and football fans visiting @entity23 for the @entity24 , for example , would pay just 60p for 30 minutes , when using the app. @entity1 said a comparable length chat from a hotel in @entity28 would cost around £ 60			2
a half - hour call from @entity30 using the app would cost just 30p , compared to a hotel phone in the @entity33 , which the company said would cost £ 14.50			0
the app can also be used to call overseas from the @entity36 from just 1p per minute			1
‘ the new app offers an even more convenient and cost effective way to keep in touch with loved ones over the summer , whether that be from the sun lounger to back home , or from the sofa in the @entity36 to family living overseas , ’ said @entity1			1

the cards are valid for 90 days after purchase or topping up			0
while @entity3 and @entity1 ’s services both require an internet connection to work , an app called @entity72 is offering calls between countries for up to 25 per cent less than @entity3 , using submarine cables			2
this means the app bypasses expensive carrier call costs , does n’t ask people to turn on roaming data and the firm claims is typically 25 per cent cheaper than @entity3			2
but the app does not have such a large geographical spread , as users can call from 16 countries			0

@entity120 has unveiled its new @entity122 technology that it says can decode languages in real - time			0
it means that during video calls the speech recognition software will allow two callers from different countries to talk with ease			0
