by @entity0 a couple whose baby was stillborn have spoken of their ‘ horrendous ordeal ’ after a hospital admitted she would have lived if it was not for a series of blunders			1
@entity8 and @entity10 ' daughter @entity9 was delivered stillborn on august 17 2011 following an emergency c - section			1
the couple say their baby can not be brought back but that if the hospital were to apologise and learn from the mistakes then they would be able to move on with their lives			0
@entity20 and @entity19 ' baby , @entity9 , was stillborn as a result of a catalogue of errors at @entity24 in @entity25 the @entity27 trust which runs @entity24 in @entity25 has admitted liability and agreed an undisclosed settlement with the family			1
according to the family ’s lawyers , an investigation found that @entity9 ’s death was caused by a catalogue of errors and poor communication by medics which led to her brain being starved of oxygen			1
the midwife in charge of mrs @entity45 ’s care was referred to the @entity46 and given a 12 - month suspension order , the lawyers said			1
‘ to this day we are still shocked and appalled by what we went through and the tragic loss of our daughter @entity9 , ’ said mrs @entity45 , 46 , who lives in north @entity25			1
‘ to know that our baby would have been born healthy had it not been for the failures to report her abnormal heartbeat is incredibly difficult to come to terms with			0
‘ everyone makes mistakes but there are lives at stake and my baby deserved the best possible care but , sadly , both she and i were failed			1
’ @entity9 was delivered by emergency c - section but she had suffered catastrophic brain damage mrs @entity45 added : ‘ my family have not even received an apology despite the trust ’s admission			1
this is just shocking and has left us very angry			0
‘ it is just beyond belief how you could treat someone like that			0
‘ we never want anyone else to have to suffer the same heartache we did , and although we know the trust said improvements would be made immediately , we want to see proof of this			0
‘ nothing will ever bring our daughter back but if they can apologise and prove that lessons have been learnt and shared across the @entity27 then hopefully we can start to put this horrendous ordeal behind us and try and re-build our lives			0
’ @entity90 , a lawyer at @entity91 who represents the couple , said @entity9 ’s death was completely avoidable			2
she explained how mrs @entity45 ’s pregnancy was considered high risk as she was 43 - years - old and had previously suffered a miscarriage , yet no delivery or induction plan was agreed for her			2
ms @entity90 said an internal investigation into the midwife in charge ’s actions found breaches including the misinterpretation of the foetal heart trace , inadequate and inaccurate record keeping , failure to keep mother and baby the focus of care and failure to act within trust guidance			1
ms @entity90 said : ‘ the loss of baby @entity9 has truly devastated @entity8 and @entity20 because she should still be alive today			1
‘ despite having the technology to identify when a baby ’s heartbeat is irregular or weak through the @entity121 machine , changes on the monitor were not reported correctly for a period of eight hours which prevented the appropriate action , such as an emergency caesarean , being taken sooner			2
‘ this meant that @entity9 suffered catastrophic brain damage			1
‘ we welcome the fact the trust has admitted responsibility for the failings but it is concerning that @entity8 and @entity20 have not had an apology for their loss			2
‘ @entity9 ’s death was completely avoidable and we hope that the action plan drawn up by the trust has been shared throughout the @entity27 to ensure the same mistakes are not repeated and patient safety is protected			2
’ @entity138 , chief executive of @entity139 , said : ‘ the events leading up to the loss of @entity9 fell far short of the high standards of care we normally provide and for this i am very sorry			2
‘ a full investigation led by a senior doctor was undertaken into the failure to recognise and escalate concerns in the labour care			0
‘ this report has been shared with @entity149 and mrs @entity45 and i can reassure them that we are committed to using this to ensure we learn from every aspect of what happened			0
the hospital has accepted liability for @entity9 's death and has agreed an undisclosed settlement with the family ‘ quite rightly our clinical staff have to be accountable for their actions			1
’ mr @entity138 said the midwife concerned was immediately removed from practice and referred to the @entity162			0
he said she subsequently chose to retire and is no longer employed by the trust			0
he said : ‘ in 2012 , our head of midwifery and lead consultant met personally with @entity149 and mrs @entity45 to discuss their concerns and to express their profound condolences and apologies			0
‘ i am very sad to hear that @entity149 and mrs @entity45 feel they have not had an apology from the trust , as we have done our best to provide this			0
‘ as chief executive i would like to reiterate how sorry i am on behalf of everyone concerned in this tragic case			0
