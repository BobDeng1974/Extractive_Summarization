rare bitterns are bouncing back with the highest number of ' booming ' males recorded since the nineteenth century , wildlife experts said			1
the elusive heron - like birds , which were driven to extinction in the @entity8 , have been helped by @entity10 conservation measures which have supported the restoration and creation of wetland habitat that they rely on , the @entity4 said			1
the bird , prized as a medieval banquet dish and hit by hunting and the loss of its reedbed habitat as wetlands were drained , became extinct in the @entity8 in 1886			1
the shy , well - camouflaged bitterns are hard to spot , but mating males can be counted from their loud , distinctive boom - like call which carries several miles across marshland it managed to recolonise the @entity27 in 1911 , but while numbers rose until the 1950s they then crashed once more to a low point in 1997			1
the shy , well - camouflaged bitterns are hard to spot , but mating males can be counted from their loud , distinctive boom - like call which carries several miles across marshland			1
the latest survey has revealed there were 140 booming males across 61 sites in 2014 , up from just 11 males at seven sites in 1997			1
more than a dozen of the sites where bitterns were counted this year are current or former gravel pits , brick pits or open coal mines where reedbeds have been restored , showing the importance of recreating habitat at quarries and other such spots , the @entity4 said			2
new reedbed habitat for bitterns has also helped other species , ranging from water voles to white egrets and rare small dotted footman moths			0
the @entity4 credits the @entity58 's life - nature programme for supporting it and other organisations to recreate wetland habitat			2
the wildlife charity also said @entity58 protections for birds have helped by requiring the @entity8 government to take action to boost bittern numbers , designating and ensuring habitat is properly managed for the birds			1
funding from the life - nature scheme allowed the creation of more than 300 hectares ( 740 acres ) of new reedbed , an area about the size of the @entity75			2
in addition , more than 350 hectares ( 860 acres ) of habitat were restored across 19 sites			0
the bird , prized as a medieval banquet dish and hit by hunting and the loss of its reedbed habitat as wetlands were drained , became extinct in the @entity8 in 1886 this year , the highest number of bitterns recorded were at @entity87 , inland marsh habitat in @entity89 where 20 males were booming			1
the @entity4 said @entity89 now had @entity92 's largest bittern population			0
but concerns have been raised that the @entity58 conservation laws which have helped species such as bitterns could be weakened by the new @entity97			0
@entity98 , director of conservation at the @entity4 , said : ' thanks to protection under @entity10 laws and key partners working together , bittern numbers have been gradually climbing since 2000			0
' @entity106 needed conservation on a country - wide , landscape scale and without the support of the @entity58 's @entity111 , which protects all @entity10 wild birds and the habitats of listed species like the bittern , this would not have been possible			2
' the bittern success story should give hope that it is possible to recover threatened species and that it makes sense to protect the laws that protect nature			0
' environment secretary @entity122 said : ' the bitterns distinctive ' booming ' call is just one way in which it is a truly special bird , and i 'm delighted that future generations will have a chance to hear it			0
' this success is down to the hard work of the conservation organisations , landowners and government agencies who worked together to improve and create new reedbeds for bitterns to breed in			0
