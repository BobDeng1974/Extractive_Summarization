a sheep farmer has won an apology from supermarket giant @entity2 after a leg of lamb she bought from them labelled as @entity6 turned out to be imported from the other side of the world			1
@entity9 was shocked to find a stamp on the £ 11 joint saying it had come from @entity12 despite @entity2 's packaging claiming it was born , reared and slaughtered in the @entity6			1
mrs @entity9 , who runs a 1,600 - acre sheep farm with her husband @entity15 , had purposely sought out @entity6 produce in support of her fellow farmers			1
misleading : the leg of lamb @entity9 bought from @entity2 in @entity21 , @entity22 , claims on the packaging that it is from the @entity6			1
but a stamp on the meat ( pictured ) is from the @entity12 health inspector but she was horrified when she got home and found the ' home - grown ' leg of lamb had actually been flown halfway round the world to the store in @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity2 said the mislabelled lamb was a one - off and that the gaffe was the result of human error			1
but mrs @entity9 has questioned the claim and is now warning other shoppers to be extra vigilant when choosing their joints of meat			1
the label on the @entity43 's selection leg states it is ' born in the @entity6			2
cut in the @entity6 ' but a stamp branded onto the animal 's skin carries the stamp of the @entity12 health inspector			1
the error has been called ' unacceptable ' by farming unions who are now demanding to meet with bosses at the supermarket chain to discuss their future plans for selling @entity6 lamb			0
@entity2 says it has carried out an investigation into the mistake which revealed mrs @entity9 's leg of lamb was the only one mislabelled at the @entity61 store she shopped at			1
@entity9 , 57 , has refused to accept @entity2 's explanation that the mistake was a one - off mrs @entity9 , 57 , whose farm has 1,300 sheep , said : ' as a sheep farmer i 'm very interested in making sure i buy @entity6 meat			1
' the lamb i bought from @entity2 was clearly labelled @entity6 born , @entity6 raised , @entity6 slaughtered			2
' it was n't until i got home and looked at it more closely that i realised the stamp actually on the meat itself said @entity12			2
' it was a bit of a shock and something i feel rather strongly about as a sheep farmer - the last thing i want to do is buy @entity12 lamb			1
' i was completely baffled so i wrote to @entity2 and they came back apologising but saying it was an isolated incident			2
' i just do n't believe that			0
i 'm sure it was a mistake but i bet there were more , i ca n't see how just one could have been wrongly labelled			0
' she added : ' they 've held their hands up but is that enough ? a big company like @entity2 should have procedures in place to make that sort of error pretty much impossible to make			2
' as farmers we have to deal with traceability			0
the form - filling is really onerous , and that needs to apply right the way through the chain			0
' we are doing our part so you would have thought big companies should be able to do their part			0
' i think @entity6 meat is a better product , it tastes better , but it 's also much better for the environment than shipping it round the world			0
you could n't get much farther away than @entity12			2
' mrs @entity9 has now advised other people to check their meat thoroughly to make sure it is from where it says it is			2
@entity116 from @entity117 @entity22 said : ' for a sheep farmer like mrs @entity9 to have bought a product she thought would support her fellow @entity6 farmers only to discover that it was imported is unacceptable and @entity2 has acknowledged that			1
an @entity2 spokesman said : ' this was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled ' it is estimated that more than 70 per cent of the @entity12 lamb sold in @entity6 comes from halal slaughterhouses without the fact being declared on the label			1
all the slaughtermen in these establishments must be @entity135 and say a prayer when making the cut across the animal ’s throat which kills it			0
the @entity12 meat industry has taken the step to ensure its lamb can be sold in @entity135 markets round the world			2
in conventional slaughterhouses , animals are stunned before they are killed by having their throats cut			0
however , in most @entity135 countries , halal means the animals must not be stunned first			0
' @entity2 's planned review of practices at the @entity61 store is a sensible step and it would be prudent for guidance to be re-issued to its suppliers and all @entity2 stores across the country to avoid fresh meat being incorrectly labelled in the future			1
' shoppers who want to support @entity6 farmers need to be able to trust the labels used in every supermarket			0
' he added : ' thankfully incidents of this kind are rare but the vigilance of mrs @entity9 has provided an excellent reminder to all retailers of the need for best practice and accurate labelling at all times			0
' if it says @entity22 or @entity6 on the label , it must be @entity22 or @entity6 in the packet			0
' an @entity2 spokesman said : ' this was an isolated incident where a leg of lamb was accidentally mislabelled			1
' we pride ourselves on product traceability and transparency and are committed to sourcing @entity6 products first when in season			0
' this was a genuine colleague error for which we apologise and was not meant to mislead any of our customers in any way			0
' we 've briefed our colleagues at the @entity61 store to make sure this does n't happen again			0
