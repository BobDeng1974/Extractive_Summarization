@entity0 will return home today to the mist - shrouded hills he roamed as a boy			1
here in @entity4 , the sun seldom pierces the leaden clouds , but by midday tomorrow when it reaches its zenith , he should have been buried			2
in keeping with the traditions of his @entity11 tribe , his funeral ought to be a great family gathering when the entire @entity0 clan , numbering more than 70 , come together			1
but many members of the @entity0 clan have not been invited to attend in favour of international @entity24 mr @entity0 , who died aged 95 , was described as one of the most iconic world leaders in history it is what he would have wished			1
but , sadly , it is n’t going to happen			2
for though the huge ‘ marquee ’ constructed in the grounds of @entity0 ’s mansion will accommodate 4,500 vip guests , among them prince @entity34 , there is apparently insufficient room for many relatives			1
his great - nephew @entity40 – grandson of the former president ’s brother @entity41 , who died last year – lives just across the road from the ‘ big house ’			0
yet even this 13 - year - old can not get a pass			0
guests : prince @entity34 and @entity47 are among the thousands of @entity24 who will attend the funeral of @entity0 at the expense of members of the former @entity19 leader 's clan instead , @entity40 will have to watch the ceremony on a grainy tv			1
‘ i ’m sad because i would have liked so much to be there , ’ he told me forlornly			0
‘ but they say there are not enough passes for young ones in the family			2
’ also excluded are @entity0 ’s niece , @entity63 , 38 , the daughter of his last - surviving sister and her family of 16			1
they live a few miles from the mansion , in one of the many round - shaped , mud - built hovels			2
as it has no electricity , they wo n’t even see the broadcast but will join the throngs jostling for some sort of view			0
sidelined : @entity0 's niece @entity77 is among the family members who had not been invited to attend the service @entity40 , 13 , a grand nephew of the late mr @entity0 who lives right oppisite @entity0 's house in @entity20 was not allowed to attend the funeral @entity19 boys watch preparations taking place around @entity0 's home in the ancestral village of @entity20 the family grave yard where the great statesman will be laid to rest ‘ it makes us feel like outcasts , ’ @entity63 told me tearfully , blaming the eldest of @entity0 ’s three daughters , @entity92 , 59 , who , she says , is deciding who should be invited			1
‘ when my husband asked for accreditation , she refused			0
i think it ’s because we are so poor and she thinks we might embarrass the family			2
’ the guest - list has also upset the broader community , incensed so few of them will be allowed in			0
‘ if @entity0 could wake tomorrow , he would be very upset because he would have wanted the families of the people he grew up with to be there , ’ said local @entity104 councillor @entity103			1
‘ after all , this is supposed to be his homecoming			0
’ snub : xhosa youths are pictures in @entity20 ahead of the funeral of @entity0 tradition : locals in @entity20 slaughter six sheep in preparation for a memorial service for @entity0 in his birth village tens of thousands of @entity19 queued for hours to see the body of @entity0 lying in state the body of @entity0 lies in state in @entity125 , @entity19 , earlier this week love : many of the mourners held banners and placards showing their love for the former leader long journey : the funeral cortege of @entity0 makes its way along @entity135 towards @entity136 last chance : mourners line along the street as the funeral cortege carrying the coffin of former @entity19 president @entity0 drives through , on its way to lie in state for the final day at the @entity136 in @entity125 immediately after mr @entity0 ’s body arrives at the mansion this morning , an ox will be slaughtered and other tribal rituals followed			1
the @entity4 people are clearly determined to play their @entity150 a woman reminded me , less than 20 years ago this was still a sham republic to which black people were consigned under apartheid			0
now , of course , she can come and go as she pleases			0
she owes her freedom to one man , whose values were forged in these hills , and tomorrow , however long she must stand by the roadside , she is determined to be there and show her gratitude			0
guess who : a giant statue of @entity0 is prepared before its official unveiling in front of @entity136 where @entity0 is lying in state a celebration : others were more cheerful as they celebrated the freedom fighter 's life dedication : the government said some 50,000 people had gathered by 7.30am , and witnesses said the lines in @entity125 , @entity19 's capital , were already several miles long			1

under tribal traditions @entity0 's funeral ought to be a family gathering
huge ' marquee ' constructed at @entity0 's mansion to accommodate @entity24
but there is apparently insufficient room for many relatives
