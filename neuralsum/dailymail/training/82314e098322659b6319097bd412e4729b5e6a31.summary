many of us use @entity2 to plan parties and invite guests these days and most us of click to say we 're attending without giving it much thought			2
but what if complete strangers , who had also clicked to attend the same event , could then see your profile and personal information without you having a clue ? @entity15 is a new app , hoping to launch in july , which essentially allows people to obtain information about someone before meeting them			1
the @entity22 website allows you to sign up to be notified when the app - which will allow you to check out people attending the same events as you beforehand - launches described as ‘ your clever companion for future plans ’ @entity15 will allow you to ‘ check out girls and guys ’ who have replied as ' attending ' to any event invitation on @entity2 which you plan to go to as well , @entity26 reports			1
essentially a dating app , one of the key pieces of information @entity15 sends you about guests at any upcoming events is their relationship status , alongside mutual friends , interests and anything left ‘ public ’ on that person ’s @entity2 profile			1
users will be able to filter results to show them , for example , anyone who is also attending @entity52 who is single , in their 30s and likes the same films and tv programmes			2
the idea is that you can scout out potential romantic targets before ever meeting them , and even prepare conversations based on their likes or hobbies			0
while this might seem like a clever , time - saving device for the savvy single in the digital age , there are worries about privacy			0
other apps only involve or allow you to view people who have voluntarily signed up to them and created a profile of the information they want you to see			0
the idea is that you can scout out any potential romantic targets before ever meeting them , and even prepare conversations based on their likes or hobbies controversially @entity15 uses @entity2 information and does not allow people to opt out of being searchable			1
so by merely clicking ' attending ' on an event all your public information becomes available to anyone else attending that event that has downloaded @entity15			2
the only way to avoid this is to manually remove yourself from every event you are invited too			0
@entity22 , which already has an active @entity91 account , will use public @entity2 information without specific consent by merely clicking attending to an event all your public information becomes available to anyone else attending that event that has downloaded @entity15 however since the app is only taking information left ‘ public ’ on @entity2 it is likely it would not break the websites strict privacy rules			1
speaking to @entity103 at @entity26 , @entity22 ceo and co-founder @entity105 defended the app , which could allow strangers to view all profile pictures , ‘ liked ’ groups or pages and even location or workplace information , depending on your individual privacy settings			1
arguing that they only are in fact using data that @entity2 has already made public , @entity105 said : ‘ we just have the first name of the person , the picture , his friends ’ connections and the likes that you have in common			0
‘ one thing that you can not do is completely hide yourself			0

@entity15 app hopes to launch in july
will allow you to see and filter information on anyone attending same event
only uses information left *visible* to ' public ' on @entity2
however no option to opt out of being searchable by app users
could allow profile pictures , relationship status , interests and employment information to be viewed by strangers without your *knowledge*
