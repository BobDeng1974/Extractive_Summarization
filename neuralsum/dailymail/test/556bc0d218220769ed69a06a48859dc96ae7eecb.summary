beef at a good price if @entity3 is going to watch his @entity4 wickets record get beaten by @entity6 , he might as well earn himself a bit of cash doing it			1
after spotting that @entity9 were offering 9/4 on the @entity11 seamer to take four wickets in the first innings on wednesday morning , @entity3 , who remains @entity16 ’s leading wicket - taker for the time being with 383 , tweeted : ‘ i ’ll have a go at that price ! ! ! ’ sir @entity3 was tempted to bet on @entity6 breaking his record on the third morning in @entity20 @entity22 ’s girl with @entity3 ’s record in his sights , all eyes at the sir @entity24 were on @entity6 — including those of his wife @entity29 and daughter @entity29			1
but the @entity31 kept everyone waiting , and watching test cricket can be a hard slog for anyone — let alone a four - year - old			1
@entity6 's wife @entity29 and daughter watch the action from the stands at the sir @entity24 @entity42 ’s funny while tributes were paid to @entity6 on @entity45 at lunch , former team - mate @entity43 revealed how he used to wind him up			1
‘ it was great when his face was on the back of all of those @entity51 buses last year — just so i could say to him “ you ’ve got a face like the back of a bus ” , ’ said @entity43			0
@entity6 picked up one wicket on day three , but is still one shy of @entity3 's record of 383 dismissals @entity59 spinning in the @entity60 announced on wednesday that @entity61 has been called up for the next test in @entity63			1
the question is , where will he fit into the first xi with off - spinner @entity67 bowling so well ? it would be embarrassing for @entity59 if he was kept out of the @entity16 team by a man who ca n’t get into his own county side			2
@entity61 , pictured playing for @entity73 , has been added to the @entity16 squad for the remaining tests @entity76 frustrates @entity77 by far the most interesting on - pitch battle was between @entity79 and @entity76			1
the @entity81 ’ sixth man in scored 112 in the first innings , much to the frustration of @entity79 — and not just because of the eight boundaries the @entity85 hit off him			0
after tuesday ’s no - ball episode , @entity79 narrowly missed out on @entity76 ’s wicket twice on wednesday — seeing an edge dropped by @entity67 at slip , followed by a close lbw denial upheld by the third umpire			2
@entity76 hit his maiden test match century in his sixth match for the @entity81 on wednesday @entity79 was frustrated twice when he thought he dismissed @entity76 , adding to tuesday 's no - ball five - star @entity96 @entity67 rightly took the plaudits on day three , but @entity99 put in a tidy performance with the gloves			2
the @entity11 wicketkeeper took five catches for the first time in a @entity4 innings			0
he ’s only the second keeper to do so against @entity81 , after @entity106 in 1990			0
@entity99 took five catches for the first time in a test innings , only the second @entity16 ' keeper to do so looking hot , man during lulls in the proceedings , fans were treated to dancing from the excellently - costumed @entity115 man			0
he certainly kept spirits up among members of the crowd , but that outfit does n’t look tailor - made for the @entity122 30 - degree heat			0
