by @entity0 in recent years , astronomers have been astounded by just how much @entity2 resembles @entity3			0
like our planet , the surface of @entity5 is covered with lakes and seas ; it has islands , mud , rain clouds , river channels and , according to some scientists , even rainbows			1
and now the first hints of waves on the seas of the moon have now been revealed			1
if confirmed , this would be the first discovery of ocean waves beyond @entity3			0
this image shows the first flash of sunlight reflected off a lake on @entity2 's @entity5			1
the glint off a mirror - like surface is known as a specular reflection			0
it confirmed the presence of liquid in the moon 's northern hemisphere , where lakes are more numerous and larger than those in the southern hemisphere in 2012 and 2013 , @entity39 ’s @entity38 spacecraft captured several unusual glints of sunlight off the surface of @entity43 , one of @entity5 ’s hydrocarbon seas			1
those reflections may have been created by tiny ripples , around 2cm high , said @entity48 , a planetary scientist at the @entity49 in @entity50			1
professor @entity48 presented the findings at the @entity52 and @entity53 , according to a report in @entity55			0
researchers expect more waves to appear in the next few years , as winds pick up in @entity5 ’s northern hemisphere as it emerges from winter and approaches spring			1
a glint of light is seen in the same spot in this image taken by the @entity38 probe in july 2012 with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity5 resembles a frozen version of @entity3 , several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere			1
because @entity5 is less massive than @entity3 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 600km ) into space			1
as on @entity3 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that come with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity5 are about seven @entity3 years long			1
@entity5 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity83 , better known on @entity3 as natural gas			2
regular @entity3 - water , @entity87 , would be frozen solid on @entity5 where the surface temperature is 140 ° @entity89 ) below zero			2
with @entity5 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity3 's raindrops			2
as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes			0
scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades			0
knowing how the waves form will help scientists to better understand the conditions in @entity5 ’s lakes and seas			1
a @entity39 mission proposal , which was beaten by a proposal to return to @entity105 , would have sent a probe to float in one of @entity5 ’s lakes			1
‘ if we drop a lake lander in there , is it going to splat instead of splash ? ’ professor @entity48 asked at the conference			0
@entity5 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity83 , better known on @entity3 as natural gas			2
regular @entity3 - water , @entity87 , would be frozen solid on @entity5 where the surface temperature is @entity120 ( -290 ° f )			2
the idea that @entity5 is a wet world with its own alien waters is widely accepted , but the lack of waves has stumped scientists for years			1
on @entity3 , bodies of water are rarely still			0
breezes blowing across the surface cause waves to ripple and break ; raindrops striking sea surfaces also provide some roughness			0
yet on @entity5 , the lakes seemed eerily smooth , with no discernible wave action down to the millimetre scale , according to radar data from @entity38			1
centered on the north pole , this map shows @entity5 's bodies of methane and ethane in blue and black			2
roughly heart - shaped , the lake above and right of the pole is @entity145			0
just below the north pole is @entity43			0
this is where @entity38 spied several unusual glints of sunlight off the surface in 2012 and 2013 @entity5 ’s gravity , which is only 1/7th that of @entity3 , also provides very little resistance to wave motion			1
researchers had previously toyed with several explanations , including that the lakes may be frozen or covered with a tar - like substance that damps wave motion			0
if waves appear over the next few years , @entity38 should be able to detect them			2
radar reflections from wavy lake surfaces can tell researchers a great deal			0
wave dimensions , for instance , may reveal the viscosity of the underlying fluid and , thus , its chemical composition			0
also , wave speeds would track the speed of the overlying winds , providing an independent check of @entity5 climate models			1
@entity176 , a planetary scientist on the @entity38 radar team , is excited about ‘ bringing oceanography to another world			0
all we need now , ’ he said , ‘ are some rough seas			0
' researchers expect more waves to appear in the next few years , as winds pick up in @entity5 's northern hemisphere as it emerges from winter and approaches spring			1
pictured here is @entity2 , with its giant @entity5 in the foreground			2

@entity189 of light created by tiny ripples around 2cm high , claim scientists
more waves are expected to appear in the next few years as winds pick up
knowing how the waves form will help scientists to better understand the *physical* conditions in @entity5 ’s lakes and seas
