by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 15 october 2012 updated : 07:11 est , 15 october 2012 @entity1 led an ordinary life in @entity3 , @entity4			1
she had been active in the local conservative party and had volunteered at her local hospital			2
few knew the 91 - year - old had spent the @entity8 infiltrating @entity10 sea patrols before cracking codes at @entity13 - home of the @entity15 decoder			1
miss @entity1 , who died on friday , was so determined to keep that ' difficult ' part of her life private , even her parents and two brothers , one of whom was an @entity22 pilot , died without ever knowing the truth about her wartime experiences			1
recognition : former @entity8 codebreaker @entity1 , left , holds up her @entity25 and certificate received before her death on friday and right , in uniform after joining the women ’s auxilliary @entity29 in 1942 but last year miss @entity1 decided to reveal her extraordinary story after watching a documentary about undercover agents in @entity33			1
she also received a @entity25 and @entity34 of @entity13 in the post , along with a letter from @entity37 thanking her for her ' vital service ' , after she was nominated for the top honour by a historian			1
miss @entity1 whose mother was @entity43 joined the women ’s auxilliary @entity29 in 1942 but was seconded to the @entity43 resistance after @entity46 chiefs discovered her bi-lingual background			1
codebreaker : few knew the 91 - year - old had spent the @entity8 infiltrating @entity10 sea patrols before cracking codes at @entity13 - home of the @entity15 decoder incredible journey : miss @entity1 went by submarine to @entity56 , in @entity10 occupied @entity43			1
after her mission she walked to @entity58 before escaping back to @entity59 in the empty bomb bay of a @entity62 aircraft proud : last year miss @entity1 received a a certificate , left , from @entity37 and @entity25 in honour of her ' vital service ' during the @entity8 @entity66 called them ‘ the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled ’			1
indeed the importance of the code breakers at @entity13 can not be underestimated			1
intelligence from @entity25 played a vital part in the defeat of the u-boats in the six - year @entity76 , @entity59 naval triumphs in the @entity78 in 1941 and the @entity79 off the coast of @entity43 in 1943			1
by 1944 @entity59 and @entity82 commanders knew the location of 58 out of 60 @entity10 divisions across the @entity85			1
in addition , a great deal of information was decrypted about general @entity91 ’s @entity90 forces in @entity92			2
@entity93 was a 24 - hour operation			2
codes came in at all times and were colour - coded depending on which branch of the @entity10 military they involved			2
the code was then sent to relevant sections to be deciphered			2
initially this took time but with the advent of the @entity104 computers - an ingenious device that enabled @entity25 staff to crack the @entity10 military 's enigma code - codes could be cracked within hours			1
once broken , the codes were translated into @entity110			2
she was taken to @entity10 occupied @entity43 in a submarine , having refused to be dropped by parachute			1
at the time , women were not allowed on submarines , so she had to pretend to be a boy			2
she was assigned to give key information on a heavy water factory being developed by the @entity10 for energy purposes			2
her operations helped in the build up to the famous sabotage attack by the so called @entity123 , immortalised in the 1965 film			1
after her mission was over , she walked from @entity43 to neutral @entity58 , and escaped in the empty bomb bay of a @entity62 aircraft			1
she went on to help at @entity13 when @entity10 codes were famously broken with the help of @entity15 machines			2
there she listened to @entity132 from the @entity133 for up to 15 hours at a time , passing the details to specialist decoders			0
in an interview last year miss @entity1 said : ' the work at @entity13 did shorten the war by several years and saved many lives , but it ’s very upsetting for me to talk about that time and i ’d rather forget it			1
' it was a horrible time and i do n’t enjoy thinking about it			0
i had kept quiet , but i spoke out because i watched a programme on television about a girl who worked as an agent in @entity149			0
' before that i just did n’t tell anybody what i had done during the war			0
' it was n’t how they paint it at all , with all this romance			0
i never even knew i was listening to the @entity133			0
it could be a boring job , sitting for 15 hours at a time , taking down the codes			0
documents : miss @entity1 kept her @entity29 log book but did not tell anyone of her war experiences - even her family - until last year mission : miss @entity1 , whose mother was @entity43 , was seconded to the @entity43 resistance after @entity46 chiefs discovered her bi-lingual background journey : she was taken to @entity10 occupied @entity43 in a submarine , having refused to be dropped by parachute			1
at the time , women were not allowed on submarines , so she had to pretend to be a boy ' i did n’t know who i was listening to , it was a secret even to us			2
but there are some parts of my experiences which are best left buried that i will never talk about			0
i learnt the meaning of the phrase man ’s inhumanity towards man			0
' she added : ' i understand why a lot of young people are n’t interested in the war - i used to think stories about the @entity8 were boring			1
' but if knowing about it can stop it happening again , with the terrible acts and degradation , it ’s worth it			0
i ’m certainly no one ’s hero and it ’s silly to think of it that way			0
role : miss @entity1 's operations helped in the build up to the famous sabotage attack by the so called @entity123 , immortalised in the 1965 film thought provoking : miss @entity1 's log book also provided space for her last will and testament			1
she died at a residential care home in @entity3 , @entity4 , on friday aged 91 ' during the war thousands of people did extraordinary things they never dreamed they could do			0
some more than others , but that ’s life			0
' family friend dr @entity213 , who knew miss @entity1 for more than 20 years , said : ' she was an extremely difficult person			1
she had arguments and rows with everyone			0
' but i had a real soft spot for her			0
she could be very charming			0
she was a true character			0
anyone who met her would never forget her			0
she had been through a variety of illnesses , but seemed indestructible as she had conquered them all			0
' in the end , she died of old age			0
