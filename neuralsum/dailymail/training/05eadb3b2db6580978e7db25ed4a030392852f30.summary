dozens of original artworks by @entity2 have been discovered on decaying floppy disks			1
the artworks were commissioned in 1985 by pioneering home computer company @entity5 , who wanted @entity2 to demonstrate the graphic capabilities of its new @entity8 as it went head to head with @entity15 's popular @entity14 series			2
although video footage exists of the artist creating the images alongside singer @entity21 at the launch of the @entity8 , the artworks themselves were thought lost until researchers tracked down the obsolete disks within the @entity25 and hired a team of experts to extract the contents			1
created as long ago as 1985 using an @entity8 computer , the works were thought to have been lost at some point in subsequent decades looking back : one of the files features an attempt at a full reworking of one of @entity2 's most famous artworks - the iconic ' 32 @entity40 ' series from 1962 the files revealed dozens of @entity2 's digital originals , ranging from abandoned doodles , to an adapted version of @entity46 's @entity45 , and even full reworkings of his own most famous artworks - including the iconic @entity40			1
another of the artworks shows a sketch of @entity21 , which was almost certainly created during the @entity8 launch			0
the hunt for the floppy disks began when the artist @entity55 - a self - described @entity2 fanatic and ' lifelong computer nerd ' - stumbled on a @entity59 video of the @entity8 launch			1

this is the actual computer and kit @entity2 used to do so after discussing the footage with figures in the @entity71 art scene , @entity55 was introduced to the @entity73 's chief archivist @entity72 , who was able to track the floppy disks down			2
describing the artworks , @entity55 said : ' in the images , we see a mature artist who had spent about 50 years developing a specific hand to eye coordination now suddenly grappling with the bizarre new sensation of a mouse in his palm held several inches from the screen			0
' ' it had to be enormously frustrating , but it also marked a huge transformation in our culture : the dawn of the era of affordable home computing			0
' ' we can only wonder how he would explore and exploit the technologies that are so ubiquitous today			0
