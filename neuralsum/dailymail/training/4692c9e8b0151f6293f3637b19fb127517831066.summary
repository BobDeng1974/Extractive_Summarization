by @entity0 a @entity2 priest has found a novel way of overcoming his nation 's pain at their early exit from the @entity8			1
@entity9 has denounced the tournament as a ' homosexual abomination ' , because players ' brightly coloured boots lined up bear a resemblance to the ' gay rainbow '			1
' wearing pink or blue shoes , [ the players ] might as well wear women 's panties or a bra , ' wrote @entity21 in his column on @entity24 website @entity25			0
' they might as well wear women 's panties ' : @entity29 priest @entity9 was irked by football boots the @entity31 reports that @entity21 was also cross with the ' unthinkable ' hairstyles worn by some of the players in @entity35			1
the outspoken priest 's intervention comes after @entity39 's manager @entity38 was called before the @entity39 's parliament - to explain the national team 's dismal showing			2
but hilarious as it might seem to foreign eyes , it comes amid an atmosphere of extreme homophobia in @entity39 , where gay people have been publicly targeted by vigilantes and a law was recently passed banning ' gay propaganda '			1
for @entity21 , @entity39 's awful showing and early exit was a welcome respite from the garish festival of football , which he sees as a challenge to the piety of @entity29			0
' the liberal ideology of globalism clearly wants to oppose @entity24 with football			0
i 'm sure of it , ' he wrote			0
' therefore i am glad that the @entity29 players have failed and , by the grace of @entity67 , no longer participate in this homosexual abomination			0
' ' homosexual abomination ' : the hairstyles of some of the tournament 's players also annoyed the holy man despite the priest 's pronouncements , it seems that many in @entity39 are not so pleased that their boys have returned home from @entity35 so early			1
the head of the @entity83 's @entity82 , @entity81 , last week said he wanted @entity38 to tell lawmakers how he intends to improve the @entity29 side and make them more competitive			0
@entity39 failed to win a game in @entity35 - drawing 1 - 1 with both @entity87 and @entity88 , as well as losing 1 - 0 to @entity89 - and finished third , leading to a group stage exit .			2

@entity9 said brightly coloured boots are like the ' gay rainbow '
and he took *umbrage* with the *flamboyant* hairstyles of some players
comes after @entity39 was booted out of the @entity8 in the group stages
