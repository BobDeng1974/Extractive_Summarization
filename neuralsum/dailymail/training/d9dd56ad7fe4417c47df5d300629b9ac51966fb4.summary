i do n't have as much energy as when i was obese and i actually feel less attractive			0
' ms @entity7 , of @entity31 , began gaining weight when she was a teenager thanks to her habit of snacking frequently on crisps , chocolate and soft cheese between regular takeaway dinners			1
she said despite her size she was confident in social situations			2
she said : ' people saw me as a larger - than - life character			2
i would often make jokes about my size so others would n't get the satisfaction of making fun of me			2
' when she reached her twenties ms @entity7 realised her weight was causing noticeable health issues , including frequent shortness of breath			1
after consulting a gp and dietician she was put forward for gastric bypass surgery			1
doctors warn complications of the surgery include internal bleeding , a blood clot inside the leg ( deep vein thrombosis ) and a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs ( pulmonary embolism )			2
despite these potential complications , ms @entity7 decided to proceed with the surgery , going under the knife in october 2012			1
ms @entity7 says she was a ' larger than life ' character before her bypass ( pictured ) and actually had more energy initially , she was happy losing weight after the surgery , but soon found eating was so painful she needed painkillers with each meal she said : ' i was nervous			1
any surgery is nerve - racking but it was the end result which concerned me the most			0
' after her gastric bypass ms @entity7 was initially pleased with her weight loss , but as the pounds tumbled away she became less and less fond of her new physique			1
she discovered even the smallest of food portions would leave her in immense pain			0
she said : ' i was happy with how quickly the weight fell off but alarmingly it never slowed down			0

' ms @entity7 , has been left with nausea , bloating , cramping , diarrhoea , dizziness , and fatigue			2
she has also been left with unsightly and uncomfortable excess skin			1
she said : ' i 'm just too weak			0
i thought i would have more energy but i 'm in too much pain now			0
' ms @entity7 says she has been left with bloating , cramping , diarrhoea , dizziness , fatigue when ms @entity7 realised the extent of her discomfort she decided to seek medical attention			2
she said : ' i went to the gp but they said they could n't find anything wrong with me			0
' i told them it hurt too much to eat but it was no use			0
medics concluded the pain was all in my head			2
' due to her stomach pains ms @entity7 can only usually stomach soft foods , preventing her from getting all the nutrients she needs for a healthy diet			1
her typical daily diet now consists of two oat bars for breakfast , a piece of fruit and tub of yoghurt for lunch			0
for dinner she typically eats some salad with flavoured humus or salted popcorn			0
despite her health issues , she is looking towards the future , having enrolled in a hairdressing course at @entity140			0
she said : ' i needed a practical hobby and the hairdressing course gives me a few hours of the day to get away from it all and it will give me some job prospects once my health improves			0
' i have to stop over-thinking things , i have to stop looking at food and getting worried about the pain			0
i just need to make sure i eat my three meals			0
' i still wish i had never had gastric bypass surgery			1
' i want others to think it through before they go ahead with such procedures			0
' the @entity153 recently reported that the number of gastric bypasses performed in the @entity156 has gone up by 530 per cent in the last six years			0
a gastric bypass is where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so a person digests less food and it takes much less food to make them feel full privately , it costs Â£ 9,500 - 15,000 , but is available on the @entity153 to to treat people with potentially life - threatening obesity			1
it is offered when other treatments , such as lifestyle changes , have n't worked			0
people with a gastric bypass will lose around two - thirds of their excess body weight they will need to stick to a rigorous and lifelong plan afterwards to avoid putting weight back on or long - term complications			1
this plan will include a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise			0
there are known risks to the surgery , including internal bleeding , a blood clot inside the leg ( deep vein thrombosis ) and a blood clot or other blockage inside the lungs ( pulmonary embolism ) the rapid weight loss may cause relationship problems , for example with a partner who is also obese , and it may lead to unwanted loose folds of skin , which may need further surgery to correct			1
also , many people with mental health problems , such as depression or anxiety , find that these problems do not automatically improve because they have lost weight			1
