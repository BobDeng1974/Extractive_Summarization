women may spend a fortune on anti-wrinkle creams , but it seems we ’re more attached to our laughter lines than we thought			1
a study last month , which retouched the images of 50 - somethings to fade their flaws , found that all the women involved preferred pictures in which some wrinkles remained			1
i ’m 54 , but i ’m shocked by how old and tired i look			1
i ca n’t really see my eyes for the wrinkles , and the huge crease around my neck makes me look as if i ’ve been garrotted			1
but this is the face i deserve			1
i ’ve smoked , drunk , burned the candle at both ends , sunbathed , fought off a serious disease , never taken skincare seriously and been hit by life ’s slings and arrows : my face tells that story			1
but i have no regrets — life is to be lived in the moment			1
my skin may be wrinkled and tired , but i ’m happy in it			1
not that i ’ll be posing again any time soon ! 40s - tricky years but i 'm wearing well @entity19 pictured in her 40s the ageing that i see here is acceptable			1
the wrinkles are gathering round my eyes like birds round landfill and my eyes are drooping , but i ’d say i ’m wearing well in this photo — especially since i do n’t drink water , rarely use moisturiser and do n’t have facials			1
a serious relationship broke down , i moved back to the @entity63 from @entity64 after falling ill , underwent six months of chemotherapy and did a couple of jobs i hated , so i do n’t feel nostalgic for that decade			1
but i ’d be very happy if i looked like this now			1
30s - a happy chapter , full of adventure @entity19 pictured in her 30s now this picture i like			1
it ’s recognisably me , with some of the creases ironed out			1
it makes me feel nostalgic for my 30s			1
i was happiest with my looks in this decade			1
i went to live on a boat in @entity79 with someone i ’d fallen in love with , we got engaged and i fell pregnant for the first time : it was a happy chapter , full of adventure , and which promised the settled relationship and family life i had feared i ’d never have			1
here , my face is still young enough to be pleasing , but also has character			2
this was definitely my heyday			2
@entity92 just does n't look like me ... @entity19 pictured in her 20s from sublime to ridiculous ! this just does n’t look like me — the familiar flaws and fine lines now as much a part of my face as my eyes and nose are gone			2
i was a party girl in my 20s			2
i worked hard as a journalist in @entity102 and @entity103 , had several unsuitable boyfriends and worked on my suntan when i could			2
i was reckless — that ’s what being young is about			2
but i would n’t want to go back , and i would n’t want to look like this			2
@entity109 @entity110 , pictured in her 50s , was horrified by this pictured , wishing she could give her face more volume , she says ' there ’s nothing sadder than older women chasing their looks and youth ' 50s - the worst photo i 've had taken i ’m quite horrified with this most recent picture			1
i was getting over a bad cold , so my face was much more blotchy than usual , but this is still the worst photo i ’ve ever had taken			2
i just wish i found it easier to put weight on so that my face would have more volume			1
i ’ve been fairly relaxed about the passing of my youth — i was a plain child and adolescent , so i ’ve never depended on looks			2
losing them is n’t a big deal			2
i do n’t bother too much with creams and i hate facials — there ’s nothing sadder than older women chasing their looks and youth			1
40s - face of experience , and character @entity110 pictured in her 40s i do n’t look so bad in this picture and appear to be holding up reasonably well			1
my 40s were a wonderful time , when i started to come into my own			2
i ’d settled down with my long - term boyfriend and home life was very happy for the first time in decades			1
i was also having some success as an author and doing charity work with animals and the environment			2
i had a column in a national newspaper and twice stood as an mp for the @entity156			2
i started to have more confidence and felt like i was living life to the full			2
all of that shows in this face			2
this is the face of a woman with experience and character			2
30s - i spent half of this decade celibate @entity110 pictured in her 30s this is a nice picture , but my 30s were tumultuous			1
my love life was a mess and i was constantly falling for unsuitable men — the man i thought was the love of my life never consummated our relationship , and i later found out he was gay , so i spent half the decade celibate			0
i was n’t happy and was always travelling — a way of running away and not facing up to things			0
i was constantly embarking on strange diets and going on pointless , expensive spiritual retreats and courses in an attempt to ‘ find myself ’			0
so , i do n’t miss my 30s — although i would be very happy to have this face back ! @entity184 , but i hated being looked at @entity110 pictured in her 20s this is pretty , but lacks the character of the later pictures			1
i have no desire to return to this unhappy and frustrating decade , when i had n’t found what i wanted to do in life			0
i settled down with my first boyfriend at 22 , married him at 26 and divorced him at 28			0
in retrospect , i should have lived a bit before settling down			0
i did n’t even appreciate being pretty			0
i resented being constantly looked at			0
these days , if anyone looks twice i ’m delighted ! @entity195 @entity196 , pictured in her 50s , was shocked by the toll time , unhappiness and illness had taken on her face @entity201 a shock , but this really is me i ’m so stunned upon seeing this photo , i tell myself there has been some ghastly mistake			1
it has obviously been digitally aged by ten years			0
but this careworn crone really is me			0
although my beauty regime was hit - and - miss when i was young and i ’ve occasionally used sunbeds , since i hit 40 i have taken great care of my skin			0
i slather on factor 50 , have facials , have never smoked and do n’t drink to excess			0
so , what ’s gone wrong ? i can only put it down to stress and having very pale skin			1
and the awful truth is that it ’s now too late to turn back the clock			0
40s - started on a high but it all fell apart @entity196 pictured in her 40s i love this photo			1
it ’s how i think i still look — a confident woman , comfortable in her ( slightly dewy ) skin			0
that ’s how i was ten years ago			0
i started the decade on a high — i had a new husband and two children and was bursting with health			0
then , at 48 , i was diagnosed with breast cancer			0
i embarked on surgery , followed by six months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy			0
my marriage fell apart — we divorced when i was 51			0
i was probably the most unhappy i ’ve ever been			0
i did n’t realise it would catch up with me so visibly			1
@entity240 was still full of possibilities @entity196 pictured in her 30s this was the decade when everything came together			1
i got my first job on a national newspaper , married at 31 and , a year later , had my first baby			0
my second daughter was born when i was 34			0
i adored being a mum , and all of life ’s problems ( i divorced my first husband when i was 37 ) still lay in the future			0
no wonder i ’m free of worry lines here			0
but i would n’t want to step back to this decade , knowing what lay ahead			0
nevertheless , it ’s good to be reminded of a period when life was full of so many possibilities — and so little stress			0
20s - i wish i 'd realised how lucky i was @entity196 pictured in her 20s this photo makes me so cross			1
if i could step back in time , i would give myself a good slap			0
as i look at this young , attractive woman i wish she ’d realised how fortunate she was			0
i had so much going for me , yet i squandered this wonderful decade			0
eager to find ‘ @entity269 ’ , i threw myself into a series of bad relationships			0
i wish i had treasured things that mattered — friends and my parents , who are sadly now dead .			0

recent studies show that women are more attached to their wrinkles than even they may realise
@entity279 *challenged* three writers in their 50s to look at pictures of themselves from the last three decades and say which they prefer
@entity286 , @entity110 and @entity196 put their looks under the *microscope*
