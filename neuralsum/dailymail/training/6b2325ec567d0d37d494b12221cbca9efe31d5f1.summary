@entity1 's healthcare technology is spreading quickly among major @entity3 hospitals , showing early promise as a way for doctors to monitor patients remotely and lower costs			1
fourteen of 23 top hospitals contacted by @entity10 said they have rolled out a pilot program of @entity1 's @entity13 - which acts as a repository for patient - generated health information like blood pressure , weight or heart rate - or are in talks to do so			1
the pilots aim to help physicians monitor patients with such chronic conditions as diabetes and hypertension			0
however , the firm was today forced to delay apps using the service from being distributed			0
@entity1 's @entity13 works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools , food and exercise - tracking apps and @entity42 connected scales			1
@entity13 is not an app but a back - end framework that allows third - party apps to sync with @entity1 's new and proprietary health tracking app , @entity47 this lets users chart metrics like weight , sleep and calorie intake			1
@entity1 rivals @entity54 and @entity55 , which have released similar services , are only just starting to reach out to hospitals and other medical partners			2
such systems hold the promise of allowing doctors to watch for early signs of trouble and intervene before a medical problem becomes acute			0
that could help hospitals avoid repeat admissions , for which they are penalized under new @entity3 government guidelines , all at a relatively low cost			0
the @entity3 healthcare market is $ 3 trillion , and researcher @entity72 predicts that 70 percent of healthcare organizations worldwide will invest by 2018 in technology including apps , wearables , remote monitoring and virtual care			0
those trying out @entity1 's service included at least eight of the 17 hospitals on one list ranking the best hospitals , the @entity87 's @entity86			1
@entity54 and @entity55 had started discussions with just a few of these hospitals			0
@entity1 's @entity13 works by gathering data from sources such as glucose measurement tools , food and exercise - tracking apps and @entity42 connected scales			1
the company 's @entity97 , due for release in april , promises to add to the range of possible data , which with patients ' consent can be sent to an electronic medical record for doctors to view			2
@entity106 in @entity107 has been working with @entity1 and @entity108 , @entity110 's medical records vendor , to roll out a pilot program for high - risk patients			1
the team is already tracking several hundred patients who are struggling to control their blood pressure			2
the devices measure blood pressure and other statistics and send it to @entity1 phones and tablets			1
' if we had more data , like daily weights , we could give the patient a call before they need to be hospitalized , ' said chief clinical transformation officer dr. @entity127			2
@entity128 , chief technology officer at @entity108 , said the timing was right for mobile health tech to take off			0
' we did n't have smartphones ten years ago ; or an explosion of new sensors and devices , ' @entity128 said			0
@entity1 has said that over 600 developers are integrating @entity13 into their health and fitness apps			1
the new @entity138 will use a special dashboard to show user 's exactly how their health is - and can alert doctors if something is wrong many of the hospitals told @entity10 they were eager to try pilots of the @entity148 service , since @entity54 's @entity151 software powers most smartphones			2
@entity54 said it has several developer partners on board for @entity148 , which connects to apps and devices , but did not comment on its outreach to hospitals			0
@entity55 said it is working with @entity159 's @entity158 to develop mobile health technology			0
the firm also has a relationship with the @entity164 's @entity163			0
@entity1 's move into mobile health tech comes as the @entity167 and other healthcare reform efforts aim to provide incentives for doctors to keep patients healthy			1
the aim is to move away from the ' fee for service ' model , which has tended to reward doctors for pricey procedures rather than for outcomes			0
still , hospitals must decide whether the difficulty of sorting through a deluge of patient - generated data of varying quality is worth the investment			1
' this is a whole new data source that we do n't understand the integrity of yet , ' said @entity188 , chief medical information officer at the @entity189			0
@entity1 has recruited informal industry advisors , including @entity128 and @entity191 , chief information officer of @entity192 and @entity193 , to discuss health data privacy and for introductions to the industry			1
the company said it had an ' incredible team ' of experts in health and fitness and was talking to medical institutions , healthcare and industry experts on ways to deliver its services			0
a few hospitals are also exploring how to manage the data that is flowing in from health and fitness - concerned patients , whom many in @entity211 refer to as the ' worried well			2
' @entity192 's @entity191 said that many of the 250,000 patients in his system had data from sources such as @entity218 's @entity217 and wirelessly connected scales			0
' can i interface to every possible device that every patient uses ? no. but @entity1 can , ' he said			2
@entity224 in @entity225 is developing visual dashboards to present patient - generated data to doctors in an easy - to - digest manner			1
experts say that there will eventually be a need for common standards to ensure that data can be gathered from both @entity1 's system and its competitors			1
' how do we get @entity1 to work with @entity55 ? i think it will be a problem eventually , ' said @entity239 , a director focused on personal and population health at @entity242 , an electronic medical record vendor that is integrated with @entity13			1
