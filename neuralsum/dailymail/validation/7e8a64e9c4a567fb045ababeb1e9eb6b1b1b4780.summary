so here 's the question			0
if @entity2 , at 33 , is available in the summer , and @entity3 have a chance of buying him , what should be @entity7 's best offer ? @entity8 says @entity2 can leave @entity9 if he wishes , but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world			1
the three most expensive goalkeepers so far : @entity14 ( £ 32.6m ) , @entity15 ( £ 19m ) and @entity16 ( £ 18m ) – although all were 25 or under when they made their move			0
@entity9 manager @entity8 has said goalkeeper @entity2 can leave @entity19 in the summer @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity20 are the three most expensive goalkeepers in history @entity2 can not command such a fee at his age			1
a better marker may be the £ 9m @entity26 paid for @entity27			0
is @entity2 better than @entity27 ? yes			0
so if @entity9 asked for £ 10m for a 33 - year - old reserve , should @entity3 be tempted ? yes again			1
the absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding @entity3 back			1
@entity2 could easily last another four years at the top , making him value at £ 10m			0
@entity34 was 32 when he switched from @entity35 to @entity3 in 1977 ; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39			2
there has never been a question over his worth and @entity2 could be as important			2
@entity2 is a better goalkeeper than @entity26 stopper @entity27 whom the @entity42 paid £ 9million for in 2013 @entity34 , pictured with @entity43 , spent seven years at @entity3 and played his final game aged 39			2

@entity2 has been told he can leave @entity9 if he wishes this summer
@entity3 have *lacked* a world - class goalkeeper in *recent* *seasons*
@entity2 could be an important *member* of @entity3 's side if he switched clubs
