history beckons for @entity1 this season			1
@entity4 ’s side have a glorious opportunity to become @entity8 ’s first domestic @entity7 winners and make themselves immortal			1
but they are not the only club for whom greatness is possible			2
@entity13 could end their nine - year wait for a trophy in spectacular fashion by doing the @entity17 and @entity18			1
if they were to land both pots , it would be for a record - breaking fourth time			1
@entity4 and @entity23 have to remember this when they prepare for the second leg of their respective @entity28 ties with @entity29 and @entity30			1
the @entity28 is an obsession for all managers but an obsession can not cloud the big picture for @entity1 and @entity13			1
time for a rest ? @entity4 may consider giving @entity36 ( left ) a break in the second leg in @entity29 break time ? @entity40 ( centre ) and @entity42 ( right ) could benefit from a rest in @entity13 's tie with @entity30 with that in mind , @entity4 should consider not taking his key players — men such as @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity36 and @entity50 — to the @entity51 on march 12			1
similarly , @entity23 would be better served leaving his top men at home when he heads to @entity54 24 hours earlier			1
as hard as that might be to hear , consider this : no team in the history of the @entity28 have ever overturned a 2 - 0 home defeat away in the second leg			1
city had enough trouble laying a glove on @entity29 at home , so what realistic chance do they have of scoring three away ? take a look at the assignments @entity13 and @entity1 have either side of their second legs , and the argument for making changes becomes even more compelling			1
@entity1 face @entity72 in the @entity18 at 4pm on the sunday before travelling to @entity73			1
after flying back in the early hours of thursday morning , they then head to @entity74 for a saturday lunchtime kick - off in the @entity17			1
the @entity77 derby is also looming on the horizon			2
@entity13 ’s demands are even more intense			1
they play @entity80 at home in the @entity18 quarter - final , then go to @entity54 before visiting @entity83 the following sunday			1
after that , their next two @entity17 games are away to @entity86 and a home date with ... @entity1			1
everything changed in the final moments of the first legs			0
had @entity1 and @entity13 been in the position of needing to overhaul a one - goal deficit , this topic would not have been open to debate			1
@entity4 and @entity23 would have gone full strength and all other competitions would have played second fiddle			1
the goals from @entity99 and @entity100 , however , turned the situation upside down for both sides			0
winning the @entity28 this season can no longer be the priority , not when you have given two of the best sides in the world a two - goal start with home advantage			1
anything is possible in football , but there comes a time when you have to be realistic			2
and it would be calamity if either side lost an influential player chasing an almost impossible cause			2
leave him out ? @entity49 ( back ) is likely to be fit for @entity1 's second leg at the @entity51 and him ? @entity50 is likely to start in goals for @entity1 at @entity29 despite being 2 - 0 behind on aggregate main man : @entity127 opened the scoring from the penalty spot against @entity1 at the @entity130 glimmer of hope ? 10 - man @entity13 went down thanks to a masterclass from @entity136 ( bottom ) no hope : @entity136 ' thunderbolt found the back of the net to hand @entity30 the lead at the @entity143 game changers : @entity145 was dismissed for @entity1 ( right ) while @entity146 ( left ) was sent off for @entity1 to get through against @entity29 would require a performance like no other and the physical effects would be huge			1
i ’ve played at the @entity51 and the pitch is so big it can feel like you are playing on your own , as your team - mates are always so far away			1
it is a draining , stamina - sapping experience trying to keep up with the best possession team in the business and it would be a nightmare for @entity4 if @entity1 compromised their hopes of winning the title with a tired performance at @entity74			1
that game has now almost become bigger than @entity29 and similar sentiments apply to the north @entity166 derby			0
we have reached the stage of the season where draws feel like defeats in the title race			0
there is no margin for error			0
to win the title , you need your best players available for the biggest games			0
@entity1 and @entity13 can maximise their chances of that by giving their main men an evening off in the middle of march			1
the reward could be a @entity7 or a @entity18			0
experienced : @entity185 's @entity184 ( back , centre left ) trains at the @entity51 in 2007 massive : @entity189 celebrates @entity191 's 2 - 1 win over @entity29 in 2007 get in : @entity192 celebrates as @entity191 came from behind to snatch the win in @entity194 stop this red - card rule from ruining our game two stupid mistakes ruined two brilliant @entity28 games this week and turned contests we have waited all winter for into glorified training sessions			1
both @entity145 and @entity146 deserved to be sent off under the present laws , regardless of what @entity4 and @entity23 believe			1
but the time has come for football ’s governing bodies to make a rule change that will benefit the game			2
referees should be given the discretion to not send off a player for a foul if he is the last man in the penalty area			2
it is ridiculous that teams can be punished three times — a red card , a penalty and a suspension — for one offence			2
red cards given to players who are making genuine attempts to tackle frustrate me the most			0
it is grossly unfair that the slightest misjudgment of timing can be penalised so harshly			0
bang to rights ? @entity127 was hauled down by @entity145 , resulting in a penalty @entity231 ? @entity232 hits the deck in @entity30 's clash with @entity13 that saw @entity146 sent off raging : @entity23 ( left ) was unahppy with @entity232 , while @entity4 ( right ) blasted the @entity237 ref there can be no complaints about a red card if you are the last man and you foul a player outside the box			1
in those cases , the opposing team only get a free - kick , which does not replace the goalscoring chance in the way a penalty does			1
if a foul is committed in the area , a penalty would be sufficient punishment			2
there are , of course , offences in the area that have to carry a red card			0
if a striker is fouled when about to put the ball into an empty net or a defender handles on the line , they have to walk because they have stopped a certain goal			0
but being stopped from having a goalscoring opportunity is a completely different matter			0
it should never be assumed that just because a forward is through on goal he is going to score			0
this week , i spoke to two players who have taken penalties all through their career			0
both have also found themselves running through on goal countless times			0
they agreed that taking a penalty is easier than going through on goal			1
people argue that defenders would feel they could get away with heavy fouls in the area if the laws were changed to end red cards for mistimed tackles			0
but they are missing the point			0
that is n’t my argument			0
i ’m talking about genuine attempts to get the ball			0
if someone tackles with excessive force , it is a red card			0
fair ? @entity299 ( left ) and @entity300 admit that some clubs are unhappy with the current red - card rule game over ? city face a massive task to overturn the two - goal deficit at the @entity51 next month i met @entity299 and @entity300 recently at @entity309 ’s headquarters and they said clubs are unhappy with the rule of a straight red when there is a genuine attempt to play the ball			1
it is an issue that must be addressed			0
we do n’t want to see glamour fixtures ruined in the future by technicalities			0
i used to find training sessions when the focus was attack versus defence bad enough			0
having to sit through games that turn out that way is even worse			0
my top - five penalty takers @entity40 showed how not to take a penalty against @entity30			1
from the length of his run - up to the hesitation before he struck the ball , you never thought he would score			2
with this famous five , though , you would put your mortgage on them every time			2
1 @entity338 — it is assumed that @entity340 is the greatest penalty taker to play for @entity342 but @entity338 ’s record of 32 successful kicks in a row puts him into first place			2
it ’s an incredible record			0
lethal : @entity338 ( centre ) has a perfect record when taking penalties 2 @entity340 — if only he had gone to a major tournament with @entity8 , maybe we would n’t have suffered so many shootout defeats			2
he never gave the goalkeeper a chance from 12 yards and his statistics of 48 out of 49 stands up to the closest scrutiny			0
legend : @entity340 was another @entity342 striker with an impeccable record from the spot 3 @entity361 — @entity362 moved on to 37 successful spot - kicks for @entity191 at @entity13 last week and is closing in on @entity365 ’s club record of 42 from 45			1
@entity361 scored a hat - trick of penalties in one game against @entity369			2
just like that : @entity361 rolls home a penalty for @entity191 against @entity372 4 @entity373 — his inclusion in this list is a must			2
the @entity378 defender had an incredible record from 12 yards , scoring 81 of his 86 attempts			0
@entity381 has been impressive for the current @entity378 squad but he has some way to go to match @entity373			0
easy : @entity378 defender @entity373 managed to score 81 of 86 penalties during his career 5 @entity386 — @entity386 is a quiet and unassuming lad but he has nerves of steel when faced with a penalty			2
he ’s scored 15 of the 16 he has taken for @entity80 and there was never any doubt he would score in the @entity18 tie against @entity393 last sunday			0
@entity394 : a man of many talents , @entity386 has also proven his class from the spot			0

both @entity13 and @entity1 could each have historic seasons
but @entity28 obsession could cloud clubs ' judgment
@entity4 should consider not taking his key men to @entity51
@entity23 's side have a similarly tough task as they travel to @entity30
plus , who makes my top - five penalty takers of all time ?
