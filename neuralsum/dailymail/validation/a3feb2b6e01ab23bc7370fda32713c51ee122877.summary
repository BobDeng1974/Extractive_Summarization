@entity0 would not select club captain @entity1 for @entity3 's top - four showdown with @entity4 at @entity5 next sunday			1
while @entity6 says @entity7 , available again after serving a one - match suspension , should return to @entity10 's side in favour in @entity12 despite @entity4 's convincing win against @entity14 at the weekend			1
@entity1 made his first appearance for @entity17 ' side since early february when he came on as a second - half substitute against @entity19 on monday			2
@entity1 returned to the @entity3 team as a second - half substitute against @entity19 on monday former defender @entity0 says @entity1 should not start against @entity4 on sunday @entity3 remained unbeaten during @entity1 's recent injury lay - off @entity0 says he will have to settle for a place on the bench and @entity25 columnist @entity0 would not bring the captain back into the starting xi for the crucial clash at @entity5 ' no i would n't , ' @entity0 said on @entity32 ' @entity31 show			1
' the team is playing well			0
they 're on a great run since @entity1 's been out the team			2
' unfortunately , and he 'll know himself , when you go out the team and they continue on a great run it 's hard to get back in			0
' it 's unfortunate for him but we 've all been there towards the end of our careers			0
there are players playing too well that you ca n't leave them out			0
' @entity0 says that @entity51 and @entity52 can not be dropped from the team @entity0 would also play @entity54 up front , like he did during the win against @entity56 @entity25 columnist @entity0 would sacrifice @entity57 because he is not back to his best yet @entity0 also thinks @entity17 should sacrifice @entity57 and move @entity54 up front , adopting a similar style to in the @entity56 game , which @entity3 won 2 - 1 earlier this month			1
' the problem you have with @entity57 is , he is your best striker and you want him in your team , but he 's not quite right yet			2
he 's not quite 100 per cent			0
' he 's not actually producing and these games are becoming vital			0
but you need to play him to get back to his level			0
@entity6 says he would select @entity7 after serving his one - match suspension @entity6 would drop @entity12 for @entity66 because the @entity68 's pace could be key against @entity3 former @entity4 defender @entity6 would make @entity66 for @entity12 the only change to the side that beat @entity14 ' but i go back to that @entity56 game and that may come into @entity17 ' thinking			1
that was @entity3 at their best , that high intensity and that pressing			2
that 's what you get from @entity54 at the front that maybe you lack with @entity57			1
' meanwhile , former @entity4 defender @entity6 believes @entity7 's pace could prove vital against @entity3 and says he would bring the @entity68 in to replace @entity12			1
' i think nine of them are absolute certainties , rest - aside injuries that could happen in training , ' @entity6 said			2
' i think @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 will all play			0
' the big decision is @entity66 or @entity12			0
i would go with @entity66 for pace			0
i think they will need to play on the counter attack and also match the speed of @entity99 and @entity100 ( on the @entity3 left )			1
' @entity101 ; @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 ; @entity105 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity106 ; @entity107 , @entity100 ; @entity54 @entity108 ; @entity109 , @entity88 , @entity87 , @entity110 ; @entity91 , @entity90 , @entity89 ; @entity7 , @entity92 , @entity93			1
