the @entity2 / @entity1 love - in made me sick @entity4 should take a look at @entity6 in 25 years covering football at all levels , from way down the pyramid to the @entity12 final , i do n’t think i have ever come across a footballer more determined and passionate about playing for @entity14 than @entity15 - and he ’s got special reason as well			1
@entity15 ’s back story is well - known , but let me briefly fill you in			0
born in @entity20 , his mother fled the war - torn country after his father had died			1
she made her way to @entity14 , 10 - year - old @entity15 arrived here alone some time after			1
there was a lot of red - tape , but mother and son were eventually allowed to live in the same home in @entity31 , and young @entity15 started playing football and learning @entity33			1
@entity34 striker @entity15 is determined and passionate about playing for the @entity14 team @entity15 keeps his cool to score a vital equaliser from the penalty spot against @entity39 on saturday the 21 - year - old @entity41 frontman is the current leading @entity33 goalscorer in the @entity42 @entity15 arrived in @entity14 at the age of 10 after his mother fled war - torn @entity20 following his father 's death he says that this is when his life finally started			1
what @entity14 did for @entity15 and his family is constantly running through his heart and head			2
forget the fact he was n’t born in @entity33 – he oozes more passion for this country than he could if he was born in @entity56 with a plate of fish and chips in one hand , a @entity61 in the other , and whistling the theme tune to @entity64			0
this is what he said when i asked him what playing for @entity14 would mean to him : ' it would mean the world to me as @entity14 have given me a second chance to have a better life for me and my family			0
' @entity15 , pictured celebrating for the @entity73 , admits it would be a dream come true to play for @entity14 @entity34 career @entity42 appearances : 41 @entity42 goals : 12 @entity34 ( 2014/15 ) @entity42 appearances : 9 @entity42 goals : 7 @entity79 21s appearances : 13 goals : 10 i ’m not one of those who think most @entity14 players are n’t passionate about representing their country			1
i ’ve always thought that is a lazy accusation			0
some people study whether the players sing the national anthem – i ’m not interested in that stuff to be honest , despite the fact i ’m a true @entity14 fan			0
i care about how they play , but more importantly i care about their willingness to play			0
at every level from @entity14 under 16 upwards , @entity15 has always willingly turned up , when so many others cried off			2
even when heavily tipped to move up to the senior squad , @entity15 accepted that he was staying in the @entity73 and went out and performed to the best of his ability			0
i doubt you care much about @entity14 if you ’ve read this and not felt keen to see the @entity34 striker wear the @entity105 on his shirt			1
you want passion with @entity14 ? you want someone who cares about this country ? you want someone who feels they owe it to this country to give his very , very best and more ? then let ’s get @entity15 into the @entity14 squad as soon as possible please			2
i have n’t even mentioned how good a footballer he is – the goals speak for themselves			0
at every level , from @entity14 under 16 upwards , @entity15 has always willingly turned up to play @entity15 gets the better of @entity121 defender @entity120 to score against the @entity122 earlier this season but i watched him carefully against @entity39 on saturday and it ’s fair to say he did n’t have his best game , but he still contributed two key moments			2
@entity34 were trailing 2 - 0 at @entity126 when @entity15 started a move on the left			1
he picked up the ball on the edge of the area and curled a terrific shot towards the far corner , only to see it superbly tipped behind by @entity135			0
this was five minutes into the second half , and it got the @entity41 going , it woke them up and @entity34 scored from the subsequent corner			2
@entity15 also kept his cool to score the penalty deep into added time that gave @entity34 a point			2
with @entity34 trailing against @entity39 , @entity15 brought the @entity41 to life as they fought back to draw 2 - 2 @entity15 places the ball past a stretching @entity148 to claim a point for the @entity41 on saturday there are strikers getting in the @entity14 squad who do n’t even play , let alone score			1
at @entity41 you have a committed and very good young striker in the form of his life who is passionate about playing for @entity14			1
it ’s a no - brainer			0
