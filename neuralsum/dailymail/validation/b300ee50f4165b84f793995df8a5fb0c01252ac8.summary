but the crooks ended up dumping the car in a layby on the @entity38 near @entity39 , @entity40 - when @entity19 disappeared			2
@entity42 ' body was later discovered in the @entity43 on december 24 after a police appeal for his whereabouts			2
despite their missing friend , @entity8 and @entity7 targeted another address in @entity49 , @entity50 , on december 1 and tried to steal another @entity33			1
but they were foiled when the owner realised the pair had tampered with the diagnostics of the car , which was worth £ 28,500 , and that his key fob no longer worked			1
the pair were arrested that month and linked to the thefts and attempted theft of the four vehicles - worth a total of £ 140,000			2

@entity7 , from @entity75 , @entity71 , was jailed for 15 months after admitting conspiracy to steal and was banned from the road for 18 months			1
sentencing them , judge @entity77 said : ' this was significant professional crime			0
it involved calculated and technically astute pre-planning and professionally carried out thefts or attempted thefts of high value motor vehicles			0
' they were offences of pure and unadulterated greed			0
@entity8 you were centrally involved in this			2
i accept there were other people but you were the man on the ground , organising and carrying out this sophisticated and carefully planned theft			0
' the duo stole £ 110,000 worth of @entity2 , including a @entity23 ( file picture , right ) worth £ 36,500 from @entity25 , and a @entity33 ( file picture , left ) worth £ 30,000 , from @entity34 - when @entity19 disappeared @entity99 , defending for @entity7 , said : ' the loss of mr @entity19 is something that he has really been affected by			1
' he understands that had it not been for his involvement in this enterprise it is very likely mr @entity19 would still be here with us today			0
. that is a burden he has on his shoulders			0
' @entity8 pleaded guilty to all four thefts , but @entity7 admitted the @entity25 , @entity31 and @entity34 offences			1
@entity8 and @entity7 used classified website @entity65 to track down their potential victims			1
the men would pose as interested buyers and tell the householder they needed to check the car for faults			0
they then inserted an electronic device into the vehicle ’s on - board diagnostic slot to supposedly check the vehicle 's history or mileage			0
in fact , it was a tool - used by locksmiths to re-programme car keys			2
the thieves would then clone the keys and return later while the owner was asleep or at work and steal the car			2
police had issued an appeal for the ' missing man ' in december 2013 and , after appealing for sightings in the @entity142 area , @entity19 ' body was pulled out of the river			2
after the sentencing , detective constable @entity144 from @entity136 said : ' @entity8 never wanted to be caught with the stolen vehicles and would pay @entity7 to take the risk of driving them away once they had been stolen from the victim 's home address			1
' @entity8 thought that he was above the law but a combination of information from the public and thorough checks by our intelligence analysts led to his downfall			0
' unfortunately , this is not a new method used by criminals and there were around 1,234 ' keyless ' car thefts between april and december last year			0
' we are working hard to reduce these thefts by regularly stopping high value cars to check they are not stolen and advising legitimate owners of the steps they can take to protect their vehicle			0
' however , i would like to take this opportunity to remind car sellers that if anyone comes to see your vehicle and asks to plug something into it then do n't let them			0
there is no need for them to do this and any checks they want to do should be carried out at a garage			0
