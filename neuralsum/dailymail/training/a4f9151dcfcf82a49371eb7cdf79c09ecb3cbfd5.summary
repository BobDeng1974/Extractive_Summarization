@entity14 , 22 , used a string of ' disgraceful ploys ' to fleece a dementia sufferer and other elderly people out of thousands of pounds			1
he claimed he was a @entity19 who worked with the @entity22 charity while targeting men and women in their 70s and 80s by cold - calling at their homes and convincing them they needed house repairs , @entity29 was told			1
many of his victims were disabled , included dementia sufferer @entity34 , a frail 87 - year - old who has since died , it was said			1
@entity14 also preyed on another dementia sufferer and a pensioner with @entity39 's disease who were among his victims			1
prosecutor @entity41 told the court @entity14 would talk his way into victims ’ homes , often telling them he had seen a bird fly into the roof			1
he would offer to retrieve it and get into their lofts before inventing a catalogue of false problems including urinating in lofts to present the homeowner with wet insulation , dipping roofing material in water tanks and presenting it as evidence of leaks or damp , and removing slates so water could drip through ceilings			2
he also brought dead birds into houses and claimed they had been nesting in the roofs and even built a nest out of a hay bale and placed it on a roof top himself			2
victims were quoted ' obscene ' prices and he reduced perfectly good roofs to ones needing thousands of pounds of repairs			2
in one case he drove an 84 - year - old woman to her bank so she could withdraw £ 2,000			1
he is known to have taken over £ 15,000 from his victims , but paperwork seized by trading standards officers shows that over he tried to get £ 44,000 but some of his targets got suspicious			2
miss @entity41 said @entity14 claimed to be qualified and a @entity19 affiliated to @entity22			1
but the college drop - out had only completed seven and a half months of a bricklaying course and the only bona fide business he had run was washing car windows			1
' the reality is he is a conman who based his entire business on deceiving vulnerable people , ' she said			0
' he would grossly over charge for any work he did do and any work done was of terrible standard			0
' frequently , he would leave their homes in a worse state than they had been in before so remedial works would be needed			0

passing sentence , @entity131 judge @entity130 , said : ' there were a number of frankly disgraceful ploys used by you to persuade these people to part with their money			0
' you were very persistent - going back time and time again to put customers under pressure			2
some were driven to their banks to withdraw money because for obvious reasons you preferred cash			2
' the elderly brood on these incidents			0
they feel a fool and ca n’t understand why they were taken in			0
' in this case it is easy to see why			0
you had the gift of the gab , saying you were a @entity19 doing them a good turn			1
' you are a complete hypocrite			0
' decent members of the community treat the elderly and vulnerable with respect and understanding , but by your conduct you have shown in this case you saw such people as easy targets for fraud			0
' @entity14 was also given an asbo banning him from trading or advertising as a roofer for ten years			1
two of @entity2 ’s victims have died since proceedings began			0
sergeant @entity175 , of @entity176 , said after the case concluded yesterday : ' @entity14 is a convincing and cunning conman , who chose to target elderly and vulnerable victims			1
