by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:41 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 06:09 est , 30 december 2013 @entity4 must reimpose controls on @entity7 and @entity8 migrants or risk social unrest , senior @entity3 demanded last night			1
in a letter to the prime minister , seen by the @entity14 , 90 activists and constituency chairmen demanded that he tear up plans to end transitional controls on january 1 , saying the government 's position was untenable			1
in a challenge to mr @entity4 's authority , the conservative grassroots group rubbishes claims by ministers that the government is powerless to prevent what they call a ' destabilising wave of mass immigration '			1
@entity8 immigrants huddle around @entity29 in @entity30 as a mass influx of @entity8 is expected as the new year approaches they demand that the prime minister uses a little - known clause in @entity36 law which allows governments to continue with border controls if their country is ' undergoing or foresees serious labour market disturbances '			1
the loophole – known as a ' safeguard clause ' – was used by @entity43 in 2011 to reimpose controls on @entity8 migrants at a time when youth unemployment was running at 50 per cent			2
the activists also call on mr @entity4 to stage an ' emergency ' recall of @entity49 to pass an amendment to the @entity51 , tabled by @entity53 mp @entity52 and supported by 70 @entity54 , to continue the restrictions on new arrivals from @entity8 and @entity7 after wednesday			1
the attack from the grassroots comes as a previously secret report published yesterday revealed that @entity7 and @entity8 will flock to @entity60 in far greater numbers than forecast as our economy races ahead of the rest of @entity65			2
the report by the @entity67 – which was commissioned by 74 councils and paid for by the @entity69 – warns that after immigration controls are lifted this week , @entity60 could find their jobs squeezed in some areas			0
the report , released under @entity75 laws , also predicts community tensions could rise as the new wave of migrants fight for work with other eastern @entity65 who have been settled in @entity60 for a decade			0
activists are demanding that the prime minister uses a little - known clause in @entity36 law which allows governments to continue with border controls if their country is ' undergoing or foresees serious labour market disturbances ' in the letter to mr @entity4 , conservative @entity89 chairman @entity88 says that action to strip the new arrivals of full working rights is ' a matter of economic necessity '			1
he warns : ' how are local authorities going to be able to support unrestricted new immigrant individuals and entire families without additional financial support or increased local taxation ? the fiscal position is simply untenable , irrational and grossly unfair – and may lead to social unrest			0
' he demands that transitional controls are extended until 2018 , the year after mr @entity4 has promised an in - out referendum on @entity60 's relationship with @entity107			1
describing the government 's position that it can not act as ' perplexing ' , the letter continues : ' long - term @entity60 youth unemployment – at 21 per cent – is the third highest within @entity36 & @entity112 countries			1
' as such it is only logical for the @entity60 – invoking the @entity43 example of “ exceptional circumstances ” – to unilaterally exercise its opt - out on immigration matters under the @entity120 and extend the original restrictions to 2018 to allow the @entity60 economy the space and time to reverse the long - term high youth unemployment trend			2
' attacking the government 's refusal to budge , the letter continues : ' you must be aware that this is an untenable political position given the widespread opposition of the @entity60 people – from all walks of life including ethnic minorities			0
' it is also an unsustainable economic position in view of the huge pressure already placed on public services at a time when the country is still facing acute challenges within the economy			0
' conservative grassroots say they took advice from @entity65 lawyers			2
they admit that an indefinite ban may not stand the scrutiny of the @entity150 , but a time - limited ban would ' almost certainly ' survive any legal challenge given the @entity43 precedent			0
mr @entity52 told the @entity14 : ' i 've spoken to the @entity89 lawyers			0
they believe there is a precedent here – the job market is not strong enough to sustain a whole load of new arrivals			0
i hope all this pressure on the prime minister will mean the government brings forward further measures			0
' @entity167 refused to comment on the letter , but a senior @entity53 source said the @entity53 had sustained the transitional controls on @entity8 and @entity7 as long as they could and were already limiting @entity36 migrants ' access to benefits and protecting public services .			2

90 activists and constituency chairmen demand that @entity164 tear up plans
grassroots demand @entity4 uses a little - known clause in @entity36 law
activists also call for an ' emergency ' recall of @entity49
