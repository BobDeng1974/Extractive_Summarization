by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 09:44 est , 19 october 2013 a breathtaking new view of @entity2 , showcasing the planet 's rings , has been created by an amateur image processor			1
@entity8 computer programmer @entity6 assembled the image , looking down on the second largest planet in the @entity11 , from 36 shots captured by the @entity13 on october 10			1
combining a dozen each of red , green and blue filter images the computer science graduate created the stunning mosaic			1
' currently my top choice of images to play with is the @entity13 / @entity48 missions to @entity2 and @entity49			2
' introducing the images on his page , he added : ' the images you see here are ( more or less ) calibrated images that were released to the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , they are not raw jpeg processed images that immediately appear on the mission website as they 're down linked from the spacecraft			2
' i hope you find at least some of them interesting			0
' @entity65 's @entity13 spacecraft was launched in 1997			1
following the completion of a successful four - year mission in june 2008 , an extension means it will orbit @entity2 , captured above by the craft in 2005 , until 2017 @entity25 from the @entity26 - the largest nonprofit organisation promoting the exploration of space - who spotted the images on mr @entity6 's @entity36 stream , told @entity76 : ' i try to be measured in my praise for spacecraft images			1
' but this enormous mosaic showing the flattened globe of @entity2 floating amongst the complete disk of its rings must surely be counted among the great images of the @entity13 mission			1
' @entity65 's @entity13 spacecraft launched in 1997 with the @entity87 's @entity48 probe			1
it 's first four - year mission was successfully completed in june 2008 prompting a series of extensions , which will keep the craft orbiting @entity2 and its moons until 2017			2
among the missions ' most important focus is a study of the ringed planet 's moons @entity49 and @entity99 , as well as some of @entity2 's other icy moons			1
towards the end of the mission the study is expected to shift focus diving between the planet and its nine continuous rings and three discontinuous arcs , to gather information about the gas giant			2
another image of the ringed planet captured by @entity65 's @entity13 spacecraft @entity2 is the sixth planet from the @entity113 and second largest in the @entity11 after @entity114			1
the planet was named after the @entity117 god who also lends his name to saturday			2
the gas giant has an average radius about nine times that of @entity122			0
while just one - eighth the average density of @entity122 , its larger volume means @entity2 is more than 95 times bigger than @entity122			0
the planet 's interior is thought to be composed of a core of iron , nickel and rock surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen , an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer			0
the planet exhibits a pale yellow hue as a result of the ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere			0
wind speeds on @entity2 can reach 1,100mph - faster than those on @entity114 but slower than on @entity144			0
the prominent ring system feature nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs			0
they are composed mainly of ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust			0
there are 62 known moons - 53 of which are officially named - orbiting the planet			0
@entity49 is @entity2 's largest and the @entity11 's largest moon - bigger than @entity158 .			0

experts *claims* new image must be ' one of the greats ' of @entity13 mission
spacecraft launched in 1997 and will orbit ringed planet until 2017
