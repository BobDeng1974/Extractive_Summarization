some forces insist on sentences of more than three years before they release a custody photo to the press a new secret justice row broke out last night after @entity5 discovered that hundreds of thousands of convicted criminals are having their identities protected by police			1
more than half of forces in @entity11 and @entity12 refuse to publish mugshots of offenders unless they have been jailed – in defiance of national guidelines			1
some insist on sentences of more than three years before they release a custody photo to the press , citing concerns about data protection and the criminals ’ human rights			2
this means just a tiny handful of the 1.2 million people sentenced in criminal courts each year have their pictures published or put online , even though it is widely acknowledged that publicity can link offenders to other crimes and prevent more from being committed			1
it comes after @entity5 revealed ‘ secret arrest ’ plans by police chiefs , backed by @entity33 and now put in place across the country , to prevent forces revealing the names of suspects they have detained			1
following this newspaper ’s investigation , the @entity41 ’ senior officer in charge of media policy wrote to all 43 chief constables in @entity11 and @entity12 urging them to release more photos of sentenced offenders			1
@entity50 , the chief constable of @entity51 , said last night : ‘ i ’m a little disappointed and hence i ’ve written to chiefs today			0
‘ i am disappointed to find a variety of responses to your inquiries and i ’m reminding chiefs that this is the policy			0
i ’m reminding forces of the existing guidance that encourages openness and co-operation			2
‘ we ’ve got a good story to tell – crime is down , the prisons are full – and we want to see more court results in newspapers , not fewer			0
the default position ought to be we release photos unless there is a specific prohibition such as the person is a juvenile			1
’ he added that the length of an offender ’s sentence should be ‘ immaterial ’ in deciding whether or not their image is released			0
it is not an infallible measure of the seriousness of a single crime because the sentence may be influenced by a previous record			0
a survey of 39 of the 43 police forces in @entity11 and @entity12 sows that 28 require an offender to be given an immediate custodial term at the very least before their image can be released ‘ that does n’t make sense to me and i think that is arbitrary and i do n’t think should be used as any sort of criterion to be applied to the release of images , ’ said mr @entity50			1
although the existing guidelines developed by @entity41 in 2009 are not legally binding on forces , they encourage officers to release custody images to the media			2
the guidelines state that publicising a criminal ’s identity is justified if it serves a purpose such as aiding the detection of crime , encouraging witnesses and victims to come forward , reassuring residents , increasing confidence in the justice system or preventing future offences			0
forces are being urged to release pictures and details of more detained suspects although police are told to bear in mind the nature of the crime and the impact of releasing an image on the perpetrator and their family , there is no reference to sentencing thresholds			1
however , a survey by this newspaper of 39 of the 43 police forces in @entity11 and @entity12 has established that 28 require an offender to be given an immediate custodial term at the very least before their image can be released			1
of those 28 forces , six will publish mugshots only of those given terms of two years or more , and another six – @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 – insist on three years or longer			1
of the 1.2 million people sentenced in 2012 , 98,047 ( eight per cent ) were given custodial terms			0
of these , 10,731 were sentenced to more than three years behind bars			0
one force , @entity153 , even insists that media organisations remove photos of criminals from their websites a month after sentencing to ‘ ensure proportionality ’			0
most forces added that they would release images for those given shorter jail terms in exceptional cases if the press requested them			2
a further 11 forces , including the @entity166 , said they followed @entity41 guidelines and considered each case individually rather than making custodial sentences a prerequisite			2
new guidance on relations between police and the media will be finalised this summer and approved by the @entity175 , the new professional body for the force			0
in one well - known case , @entity178 refused to release photographs of two murderers who had fled from an open prison , arguing that they had likely left the area and therefore posed no risk to residents			2
pictures of @entity187 and @entity188 were eventually published by another force .			0

more than half forces in @entity11 and @entity12 refuse to publish mugshots unless the person has been jailed
forces are urged to release pictures and details of more detained suspects
@entity200 acknowledged that publicity can link offenders to other crimes
