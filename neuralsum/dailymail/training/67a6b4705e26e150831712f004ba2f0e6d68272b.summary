@entity0 , the under - fire @entity1 president , has shrugged off the increasing pressure to act over allegations of corruption around the bidding process that enabled @entity6 to secure the @entity7			1
despite further revelations of bribery claims surrounding the selection of @entity6 — and @entity11 for the 2018 tournament — @entity0 stuck to @entity1 ’s party line yesterday			1
he took to @entity14 to say simply : ‘ never ignoring media reports on ethics allegations in football			2
but let the @entity19 work ! ’ under fire : @entity0 ( right ) has been criticised over the decision to award the @entity7 to @entity6 this was a reference to the inquiry already being carried out by @entity1 ’s own investigator , @entity26 lawyer @entity25 , who is set to complete his report on monday			1
against the backdrop of public statements of concern from @entity31 , @entity32 and adidas , who pay millions to sponsor the @entity7 , 78 - year - old @entity0 will attempt to carry on regardless , particularly as the @entity35 is due to begin here on thursday and in the week when @entity1 will also stage their annual congress in @entity38			1
while @entity0 will face more calls this week to order a new vote he is due to deliver his address to congress on tuesday			1
the response from the three main sponsors , who are calling for a thorough investigation , follows yet more revelations in @entity48 , with this week ’s evidence from a cache of millions of documents alleging a more direct link between the disgraced former @entity1 vice-president , @entity53 , and the @entity6 bid team			1
this comes after @entity6 officials insisted that @entity53 was working independently of the bid , with any payments he might have made to @entity1 officials designed only to secure support in his attempt to usurp @entity0 as @entity1 president			1
challenge : @entity0 is expected to seek a fifth term as president though @entity67 may contest the election in danger : @entity31 is one of @entity1 's key sponsors , and have called for a ' thorough investigation ' in a statement yesterday adidas followed @entity31 in voicing concerns			1
‘ we are confident that the matter is being dealt with as a priority , ’ said the @entity77 sportswear brand , their current sponsorship deal with @entity1 due to run until 2030			2
‘ @entity81 enjoys a long - term and successful partnership with @entity1 that we are looking forward to continue			0
having said that , the negative tenor of the public debate around @entity1 at the moment is neither good for football nor for @entity1 and its partners			0
’ by then @entity31 had already called for a ‘ thorough investigation ’ into the bribery claims , while @entity32 said it was monitoring the progress of the @entity25 investigation			1
‘ we expect @entity1 will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations , ’ it said in a statement			0
@entity31 said : ‘ as a @entity1 partner , we expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately			2
we continue to expect @entity1 to adhere to its principles of integrity , ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations			0
’ it is certainly unusual for @entity1 ’s sponsors to break ranks			0
@entity81 have been a sponsor since 1970 , after all			0
but there are echoes of the @entity111 winter olympics scandal here , given it was only when the major sponsors began to turn that the full extent of the corruption was revealed			2
while @entity1 earned around £ 800million last year alone through the sale of broadcasting rights and sponsorship , @entity31 , adidas and @entity32 are among the six sponsors who collectively paid more than £ 100m in 2013			1
at this stage the airline @entity122 , @entity126 car giant @entity125 / @entity124 and @entity127 remain silent on these allegations of corruption			0
but the latest allegations have certainly raised the stakes with claims that @entity53 , already banned for life by @entity1 , brokered meetings between @entity6 officials and national governments to discuss bilateral trade deals			1
in @entity6 , they insist they remain confident they will not be stripped of the @entity7			2
the response by the @entity143 came shortly after @entity31 spoke out			2
decision time : @entity26 lawyer @entity25 will finish his investigation into the @entity7 bids on monday a statement from @entity6 said : ‘ there is an ongoing investigation into the 2018 and @entity7 bid process , with which we have fully co-operated			1
consistent with @entity1 ’s rules we have been asked to refrain from commenting on the investigation and we will comply with that request			0
‘ @entity6 has won the bid on its merits and we are confident that at the end of the appropriate process , the award of the @entity7 to @entity6 will stand			1
’ here in @entity38 the only positive was the progress that is being made at the @entity163			0
there were concerns that the 61,000 - seater stadium would not be completed in time and even yesterday workmen were still racing to put the finishing touches to the ground ahead of thursday ’s opening encounter between @entity172 and @entity173			0
but inside it looked complete and last night they hosted a junior match and ran through an opening ceremony rehearsal			0
that the £ 180m stadium is situated so close to where people are living in abject poverty , in the favellas that dominate this area , could yet present more problems for the organisers this week			0
even if a strike among the underground rail network workers appears to have been averted			0
right now , though , the greater concern for @entity1 surrounds the staging the two tournaments that follow this one .			0
