the five friends who play in the @entity15 , a group more well known as an unsigned pub band , will be flown more than 15,000 miles by the @entity9 to bases in @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			2
their next stop of the ten day tour will be @entity17 , where are flying via military plane from @entity24 to perform for the troops celebrating @entity26 for an undisclosed amount			1
before they agreed , they had to call up the @entity6 to check that they were n't part of an elaborate prank or a con			2
all five members of the band , which includes @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , have regular day jobs , ranging from motor engineering to computer work			0
for years they have been playing @entity53 music at weddings , pubs and festivals , but now they 're taking a tour from @entity58 to the @entity59			1
video courtesy of @entity61 the band is ordinarily a pub band , and has played at events like weddings and festivals for around five years luck o ' the @entity53 : their brand of music is primarily @entity53 jig music , which they intend to use to get the members of the @entity10 force dancing lead singer and it consultant @entity45 said : ' the first thing i got was an email from the @entity6 asking if could we come and play some music			1
' i thought it was like one of those scams about putting money into a bank account from @entity85 so i was going to put it into the spam folder			0
' but i thought i had better check , and low and behold the next thing i am being asked if we could manage to do a week - long world tour ! the trip : their ten day tour will take them around the world , from sunny @entity17 to freezing @entity18 flying : beginning by flying from @entity97 to @entity24 , then on to the world 's destinations ' we seem to have a lot of friends now who play tambourine and would like to tag along			1
' the pub band from the tiny rural town of @entity107 , in @entity108 , will cover thousands of miles between military bases to play @entity53 music for the troops			1
their tour will see them fly from @entity97 to @entity24 , @entity24 to @entity18 , then back to @entity24 before flying to @entity17 via @entity114			0
live : the @entity3 band also take their brand of @entity117 to festivals and other events the band has been advertising their tour in the @entity10 @entity121 they are playing for to celebrate @entity26 after playing for the troops in @entity17 they fly on to the @entity19 before going back to @entity114 to fly to @entity20 and then to @entity123 before flying home			1
they will be starting off in the remote icy wilderness of @entity127 in northern @entity18 - making them the most northerly gigging band in the world			2
@entity45 said : ' the @entity131 have told us that when we play at @entity127 in @entity18 we will set the record for the most northerly gig ever played by a @entity136 band			0
their music has seen them play in front of crowds of hundreds in large venues , to smaller pubs with only dozens in the audience not spam : the band had to check that they were n't being scammed before they took the opportunity , with one member saying ' i was going to put it into the spam folder ' ' also this is the first time the @entity9 have asked a @entity154 band to perform at their bases			2
' by all accounts they 're really looking forward to it because they 've never had anything like it before			0
' and of course the @entity10 have a huge @entity53 contingency and sometimes celebrate @entity164 's day more than the @entity53 do			2
' after braving @entity18 with temperatures of @entity167 they will be flown by the @entity9 into the 86f heats of @entity17			0
support worker @entity44 , who plays guitar and sings in the band , said he was keen to promote dancing among the troops			0
the band think that they were selected because some of the @entity10 bases have a huge @entity53 contingency and celebrate @entity164 's day more than the @entity53 do tag along : the @entity15 has noticed they have a lot of friends who ' can play tambourine and want to join us ' he said : ' i 've got this image in my head of those old black and white films where all the forces are having the gang show and all sitting in seats			1
' we 're just going to have to ask them to get rid of a few , are n't we ? ' tin whistle and mandolin player @entity45 hopes that if it all goes well they could end up playing for the president			0
