by @entity0 dozens of football fans were injured in a crush at @entity5 eight years before the tragedy that claimed 96 lives , an inquest heard yesterday			1
jurors were told that the sequence of events was similar to that which took place in the later , fatal incident			2
the first crush came during an @entity17 semi-final between @entity18 and @entity19 in 1981			1
jurors examining the cause of the fatal crush at the same stadium eight years later , in another semi-final between @entity25 and @entity38 , were shown a video clip from the earlier game			1
after @entity18 striker @entity45 scored four minutes into the match , @entity18 supporters could be seen climbing over a fence , assisted by police officers who also opened two gates			2
with nine minutes on the clock , a considerable number of fans had spilled over from the terraces and sat behind the goal ; a @entity56 worker was even captured on video carrying a stretcher to assist a stricken spectator			0
up to 250 @entity18 fans were eventually moved to another part of @entity5			1
the inquest heard that 38 received injuries , including two victims with broken arms and one with a broken leg			0
@entity67 , counsel for the inquest in @entity69 , @entity70 , said huge crowds had built up outside the @entity35 turnstiles shortly before the match kicked off , possibly because fans had been delayed by an accident on the motorway			0
jurors heard 38 fans were injured during the crush , which was started at the @entity35 end of the ground - the same stand where 96 @entity25 fans were killed in 1989 the video showed @entity18 fans spilling onto the pitch , after a gate was opened to stop congestion at the @entity35 end of the ground the crush began four minutes into the game , after a @entity18 goal led to fans surging out of the stand , the inquest was told one gate by the turnstiles was opened in an attempt to relieve the pressure outside , but it was later found that capacity may have been exceeded by some 335			1
the sequence of events is similar to that which took place eight years later , the inquest heard , although the two crushes involved different parts of the @entity35 stand			0
an investigation into the earlier incident led to concerns that the terrace ’s capacity of 10,100 was too high , and so the stand was divided into three pens by fences			0
it was in these pens that 96 @entity25 fans would lose their lives in 1989			1
miss @entity119 told the jury they would later hear from police officers who were on duty at both matches as well as fans , stewards and turnstile operators from the 1981 semi-final			2
the inquest , which is expected to last up to a year , was ordered after verdicts of accidental death handed down in 1991 were quashed following publication of the @entity134 ’s inquiry in 2012			0
