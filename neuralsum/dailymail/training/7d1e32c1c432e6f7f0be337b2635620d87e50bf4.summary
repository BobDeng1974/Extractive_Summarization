mr @entity2 told reporters before leaving @entity3 for @entity4 that the main issue now is to start a dialogue , adding that it would be up to the @entity10 themselves to decide if president @entity18 should step down			2
he has been in @entity3 since saturday for talks on @entity10 with @entity21 president @entity20			2
' it may in the end come to that , but it 's not up to me , it 's up to the @entity10 , ' said mr @entity2 , a former @entity8 secretary - general			1
' our effort is to help the @entity10 come to the table and find the way out of all of this			2
' mr @entity2 added that he had discussed a possible @entity8 observer mission in @entity10 with @entity32			1
' as part of the discussions we are having with the @entity10 authorities , it 's not excluded that a @entity8 observer force may go in to ensure that the parties honor and respect the commitments that they are going to make , ' mr @entity2 said			1
mission : mr @entity2 spoke after talks with mr @entity20 , who promised @entity3 's full support for his mission			0
mr @entity20 said the mission ' may be the last chance for @entity10 to avoid a protracted bloody civil war ' @entity48 , once one of @entity10 's closest allies , closed its embassy in @entity32 today , citing deteriorating security conditions and putting pressure on the increasingly isolated government of president @entity18			1
it made the announcement as leading @entity10 dissidents gathered in @entity48 in an attempt to bridge divisions within the opposition ahead of sunday 's meeting of foreign governments in @entity63			1
a @entity48 official said the embassy 's closure in neighbouring @entity10 was a diplomatic message to @entity18 's government , which has so far ignored @entity70 's appeals			1
last year @entity48 prime minister @entity71 urged @entity18 , his one - time ally , to step down in order to end more than a year of fighting between @entity18 forces and opponents of his rule			0

' @entity21 - along with @entity97 - has twice shielded @entity18 from @entity8 sanctions over his crackdown on a yearlong uprising , in which more than 8,000 people have been killed			0
but @entity3 has strongly backed mr @entity2 's mission and has grown increasingly impatient with the @entity10 ruler , with the @entity21 foreign minister pointedly criticizing @entity18 for being too slow with reforms			1
mr @entity2 said today that his message to the @entity10 government was that they ca n't resist changes and that the bloodshed ' ca n't be allowed to drag on idefinitely			2
' ' i told the parties on the ground : they ca n't resist the transformational winds that are blowing , ' he said			0
' they have to accept that reforms have to come , change has to come , and that is the only way to deal with the situation			0
' he added that it would be unrealistic to set any deadlines			0
' it 's not practical to put out timetables and timelines when you have n't got an agreement from the parties , and this is what we are working on as speedily as we can , ' he said .			0

' it 's not up to me , it 's up to the @entity10 , ' said the @entity8 and @entity9 envoy to @entity10
