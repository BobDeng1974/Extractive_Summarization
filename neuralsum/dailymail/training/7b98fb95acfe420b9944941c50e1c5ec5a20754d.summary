designer sunglasses are all the rage , with celebrities such @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 often pictured hiding behind an expensive pair			2
but in terms of eye protection , they might not be worth the money			0
discount sunglasses were just as good at blocking our harmful rays as expensive designer pairs , an investigation by @entity14 eye specialists has found			1
celebrities such @entity3 ( left ) and @entity20 ( right ) are often photographed sporting expensive designer shades - but now an investigation has found many offer no additional eye protection dr @entity25 , a professor at the @entity26 at the @entity27 , found discount sunglasses costing less than £ 10 were just as good at blocking out 100 per cent of the sun ’s harmful @entity29 and uvb rays			1
choosing the right sunglasses is important as opticians recommend wearing them whenever in strong sunshine for longer than 10 minutes			0
this means from mid april until the end of september - when the levels of uv rays are three times higher at midday than they are during the winter			0
the levels of @entity43 during the summer can be as much as ten times higher			0
it is well known that uv light can cause damage to the eyes which often accumulates over the years , leading to sight problems			0
the uv rays from the sun - in particular uvb , the same spectrum of ultraviolet that causes the skin to burn - are most damaging to the eyes			0
@entity43 causes cataracts to form , meaning the eye ’s lens becomes cloudy in places			2
cataracts are the most common cause of blindness in the world			0
@entity65 damage can also cause macular degeneration of the eye , which can lead to loss of vision as well as growths on the cornea , the surface of the eye , which sometimes effect vision and are usually considered ugly			1
when choosing sunglasses look for one of the following : source : @entity79 @entity78 other long - term damage includes pinguecula , harmless but unsightly yellow fatty deposits in the white of the eye thought to be caused by @entity29 damage to the collagen in the conjunctiva ( the clear coating on the white of the eye )			2
photo keratitis - also known as snow blindness - can occur - when intense sun kills off the outer layers of the cornea ( the clear part of the eye at the front of the eyeball )			0
there is also the risk of skin cancer of the eyelid			1
as part of the new investigation into cheap versus expensive sunglasses , dr @entity25 bought sunglasses from designer labels coach , @entity110 and @entity111			1
all the designer sunglasses cost over $ 100 each ( almost £ 62 )			2
he also bought 11 cheaper pairs from shopping centre kiosks , pharmacies , fashion stores and street vendors which all cost about $ 10 each ( £ 6.20 )			1
a spectrophotometer - a specialist machine which can measure light - was used to measure the uv light passing through the lenses			1
he found that the cheap sunglasses performed just as well as the expensive ones , with all pairs living up to their promise of blocking 100 per cent of @entity29 and uvb rays			1
while there was no difference in terms of the protection against harmful rays , dr @entity25 said pricier glasses often do have more durable frames , higher - end design and a more comfortable fit			2
the investigation was shown on @entity138 by @entity139			0
in previous investigations , opticians have warned that dark coloured lenses do n't necessarily provide better protection than lighter coloured lenses			0
the uv filtering , the coating added to lenses so that they block out harmful rays , comes from a film incorporated into the lens not through the actual colour of the lenses			1
an eye specialist from the @entity27 , in @entity154 , @entity14 , found that discount sunglasses costing less than £ 10 were just as good at blocking out 100 per cent of the sun ’s harmful @entity29 and @entity43 rays as designer pairs costing more than £ 50			1

discount sunglasses costing less than £ 10 were equally good at blocking out harmful @entity29 and @entity43 rays as designer pairs costing more than £ 50
sunglasses from shopping centre kiosks , pharmacies , cheap shops and street vendors were *pitted* against pairs by @entity169 , @entity110 and @entity111
all sunglasses were found to block 100 *%* of harmful rays when measured using a specialist machine
ultraviolet light can cause eye conditions like cataracts , macular degeneration , growths on the cornea as well as skin cancer of the eyelid
