sickening : a worker at a halal abattoir has been sacked and three others suspended after being filmed breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep horrifying : the men could face prosecution for the ' routine abuse ' captured by animal rights campaigners using secret cameras sheep at @entity13 were filmed being kicked , lifted and hurled , with one worker recorded standing on a conscious sheep ’s neck			1
staff are also alleged to have erupted in laughter over a sheep bleeding to death with spectacles drawn around her eyes in green paint			1
slaughtermen were allegedly filmed ‘ taunting and frightening ’ animals by waving knives , smacking them on the head and shouting at them			1
and instead of praying as the sheep were killed , the @entity20 workers chatted as a radio ‘ blared out @entity59 songs ’ and colleagues sang along			1
the footage has been released by @entity63 campaigners and handed to the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) to investigate			1
slaughtermen at the @entity13 abattoir in @entity14 , @entity15 , are allegedly seen ‘ hacking and sawing ’ at animals ’ throats in apparent contravention of @entity20 practice instead of praying as the sheep were killed , the @entity20 workers chatted as a radio ‘ blared out @entity59 songs ’ secretly - placed hidden cameras were used to record practices during slaughter over a period of three days in december			1
@entity77 , head of campaigns at @entity63 , said : ‘ the vicious attacks on defenceless , frightened animals at @entity13 are inexcusable			2
‘ all four conveyor operators we filmed over three days abused animals to varying degrees , while the slaughterers looked on unmoved			2
’ she added : ‘ this is the 10th slaughterhouse in which we have filmed undercover , and it is the ninth to be caught breaking animal welfare laws			1
‘ none of the abuses we uncovered would have come to light without our cameras being in place , even though there is a government - appointed vet at each slaughterhouse			2
’ the law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering , but there are exemptions for @entity106 and @entity20 producers			1
slaughtermen were filmed ‘ taunting and frightening ’ animals by waving knives , smacking them on the head and shouting at them			1
under the halal code , animals are supposed to be killed quickly , with a single sweep of a surgically - sharp knife			1
they should not see the knife before they are slaughtered , or witness the death of other animals			2
the video footage appears to show that these rules were routinely flouted at @entity13 , where more than 4,000 sheep were filmed being killed			1
the full dossier by the campaigners said : under @entity127 law , slaughtered animals that have not been stunned must remain in position for at least 20 seconds after their throats are cut , to ensure loss of consciousness			2
but 86 per cent of the sheep at @entity13 were moved before that amount of time had elapsed , some in as little as one second , claimed @entity63			0
it said many of the practices ‘ defied expectations of what @entity140 believe halal slaughter should be			2
’ in one horror killing , it appears that the men erupted in laughter as a sheep bled to death with green spectacles painted around its eyes slaughtermen wearing the traditional @entity20 kufi skullcap and muttering the words ' @entity157 ' ( @entity159 is great ) were allegedly seen breaking rules in the way sheep were put down			1
campaigners said they recognised the risks of stirring up @entity166 feeling but ‘ witholding release of the footage would be a betrayal of our key mission to expose and combat animal cruelty '			2
a petition calling for non-stun slaughter to be banned has reached more than 105,000 signatures			2
set up by organisations including the @entity26 and @entity21 to improve animal welfare , it will now have to be debated by the @entity180 after crossing the 100,000 threshold			1
last year prime minister @entity182 has explicitly ruled out banning non-stun slaughter in a speech to the @entity185 parliament			0
kosher food also requires animals to be conscious when they are killed , although @entity63 said no kosher meat was prepared in the @entity190 slaughterhouse			2
mr @entity182 said last year : ' when people challenged @entity193 i have defended it			0
i fought as a backbench member of @entity196 against the last attempt to do something to change this , and there is no way i ’m allowing that to change now i ’m prime minister – on my watch @entity193 is safe in the @entity127			0
' the @entity202 said the video was ' abhorrent ' and against everything in @entity20			1
' animal cruelty is wrong and criminal wherever it may occur , ' a spokesman said			0
that it is being carried out in halal slaughter makes it even more incredulous			0
' the findings certainly are abhorrent in @entity20 practice , and the abattoir must be subject to the full force of the law			1
' there are urgent questions this case raises : since each abattoir is under veterinarian supervision , how were these practices overlooked ? we call on the @entity64 to look into this abuse and the flagrant disregard of the very principles of humane slaughter as a matter of urgency			1
' an @entity21 spokesman said the footage from @entity13 appeared to be ' absolutely shocking '			0
' the public has a right to expect that all farmed animals have as painless and humane an end to their lives as possible , ' she added			0
' the @entity21 firmly believes @entity238 in slaughterhouses can be a valuable tool to help improve animal welfare			0
the law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering , but there are exemptions for @entity106 and @entity20 producers campaigners did not want to stir - up @entity166 feeling but felt withholding the footage would be a ' betrayal ' ' our concern [ about non-stun slaughter ] has nothing to do with the expression of religious belief but with the practice of killing by throat cutting without pre-stunning			1
' we believe that meat produced from animals stunned or not stunned before slaughter should be clearly labelled to allow consumer choice			0
' the @entity26 said the film was ' truly shocking ' and blamed the government for not introducing @entity268 regulations already used in @entity269 and @entity270			2
' the government has delayed the introduction of the @entity268 regulation welfare of animals at the @entity276 ( @entity277 ) which would require slaughterhouses to appoint an animal welfare officer , ' a spokesman said			0
' these abuses could have been prevented if a welfare officer had been present protecting the welfare of livestock			0
' the @entity26 has long believed that slaughter without pre-stunning unnecessarily compromise animal welfare at the time of death			1
it affects millions of animals every year and action is long overdue			0
' the @entity64 , which regulates abattoirs , confirmed four slaughtermen have had their licences suspended and an investigation launched			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the @entity64 takes animal welfare at abattoirs very seriously which is why we immediately suspended the licences of the slaughtermen involved			1
‘ there is no excuse for treating animals in the way shown on the video and we are therefore investigating the footage with a view to prosecution			0
we are also continuing to investigate all the circumstances around the incident to ensure proper safeguards are introduced to stop this happening in the future			0
’ the halal market could be worth as much as £ 2billion a year , with more than 100 million animals killed using the method annually			0
a statement issued by @entity318 's solicitors said : ' @entity318 makes animal welfare its highest priority			0
we set very high standards for the way in which animals that pass through our premises are treated			0
' it is highly regrettable that one of our slaughtermen fell below those standards			0
as soon as we were aware of this failing we dismissed this staff member for gross misconduct			0
' currently three other members of staff have had their licences suspended because @entity63 claims that they have committed technical infringements of the regulations relating to religious slaughter			2
' we will await the outcome of any investigation relating to their suspension			0
' the statement said the real problem was @entity344 rules relating to animal conveyer belts and attacked @entity63 for ' breaking into our plant ' - a claim the campaigners firmly deny			2
' @entity13 is surprised that @entity63 targeted our premises , given the stated aim of their campaign is to encourage @entity238 in abattoirs , ' the statement said			0
' @entity318 has had @entity238 in our premises for over four years			0
' we can not condone animal aid breaking into our plant and undermining the strict hygiene controls we have in place			0
