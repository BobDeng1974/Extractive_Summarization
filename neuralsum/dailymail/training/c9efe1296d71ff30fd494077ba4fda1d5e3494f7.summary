a grumpy grandmother who unwrapped what she thought was a brand new iphone on @entity3 was overjoyed to discover that the prank present was actually a novelty chocolate bar			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 , bought the sweet treat for his grandma and wrapped it up in an @entity11 box , before videoing her reaction when she opened it in front of her family			1
much to @entity6 's delight , his horrified relative - having no doubt never held an @entity11 before - has no idea that the cellophane - wrapped phone is in fact a fake made out of chocolate , and quickly begins to grumble to her grandson about the inappropriate present			1
' i do n't [ need it ] , @entity6			1
' the problem is that i 'm really not equipped to handle this			0
' i have a landline phone at home - nobody knows about them anymore i guess - had it for as many years			2
' after pulling the chocolate cellphone out of the @entity11 box , she continues to lament the over-complicated technology , without any idea that the offensive gadget is , in fact , a fake			2
that is until her grandson tells her to put it in her mouth and take a bite			1
' open it up , ' he says , while filming his grandmother 's shocked reaction			2
' now i want you to put it in your mouth ... i want you to take a bite out of your phone			1
' relief : @entity6 's grandmother is thrilled to learn that her new @entity11 is , in fact , a novelty chocolate bar ' thank god ! ' the poor woman is so much happier with her chocolate phone , which she declares is ' as sweet as can be ' it takes a few seconds before his poor victim fully understands the joke - but as soon as she realizes that her new phone is actually a fake , her joy and relief are easy to see			1
' oh thank god ! ' she exclaims			0
' bless your heart , it 's chocolate			0
' she adds , laughing hysterically			0
' so i do n't have to worry about what the hell i 'm supposed to do with it			0
' and while many would no doubt be horrified at such a cruel prank , the elated grandma seems absolutely thrilled with the sweet gift , insisting that she is going to treasure it rather than eating it			0
' i 'm going to keep it for a little bit , ' she says , holding up the fake phone for everyone to see			0
' it 's just as sweet as it can be ! look at that			0
