by @entity0 it looks like a modern - day miracle and you could forgive people for wanting to take a closer look at a building that appears to be floating			1
the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9 , was gutted by fire in december 2010			1
instead of demolishing the whole building , the residents decided they wanted to save the exterior of the 130 - year - old building , so they placed the entire seven million pound structure onto 40 - foot - high steel stilts			1
' they have n’t seen anything like it before			0
they just say it does n’t look real and are just amazed that we can do that , that we can lift a building up with the piles like that			2
' engineers first gutted the damaged interior and then supported the exterior walls with special scaffolding as they dug down to create space for a two story basement			0
the extra space will allow for more meeting rooms and even parking for worshipers cars			0
incredibly , the exterior of the building has n't moved one bit			2
local landmark : the construction on the tabernacle , which was first recommended by president @entity63 , began in 1883 although the pile - supported elevation technique being employed here has been used in other locations around the world , no one associated with the project is aware of it being used on a building nearly 130 years old			1
' we felt this was the best way we could protect and preserve the original tabernacle structure while building a new temple within it and under it , ' says @entity38 , project manager for @entity79			1
' as a construction project , it is unique in all the world			2
' monitors and load sensors are being employed so engineers can be constantly aware of any changes in elevation or material stress , no matter how slight			0
' we are tracking it carefully — every day , ' @entity38 said			0
' we can see an issue before it becomes a problem , and we can make adjustments			0
' trick photography ? from certain angles it literally appears as though the building is floating pricey : no value has been given for the cost of reconstruction but many are questioning why the @entity79 did n't simply rebuild elsewhere gutted : the entire building was destroyed by fire in 2010 with just the outer shell of the building remaining a concrete wall was inserted on the inside of the brick , giving the building more stability and strength than it had when it was completed in 1898			1
with a stable exterior , crews then installed the stilts and excavated the soil around the stilts 40 feet below the buildings base			2
the entire structure is now on stilts some 40 feet in the air and from some angles appears to be floating above ground			2
the @entity79 has said the building is being converted into a mormon temple			1
the @entity7 is a historic treasure for the @entity79 , originally constructed from 1883 to 1898 at a cost of $ 100,000			1
the venue used to a community gathering place for meetings and cultural events			0
after the fire damaged the tabernacle , @entity79 leaders contemplated the future of the tabernacle ’s shell			1
the way we were : the 112 - year - old building in its former state			2
the reconstruction projected will be completed in 2015 history preserved : the @entity7 is a historic treasure for the @entity79 , originally constructed from 1883 to 1898 at a cost of $ 100,000 local landmark : the town of @entity8 believe the reconstruction of the building will bring more visitors to the town the president of @entity79 @entity149 announced in october 2011 that the building would be rebuilt and converted into a mormon temple			1
the @entity7 was severely damaged on december 17th 2010 , when a lighting technician mistakenly set a 300 - watt light fixture on a wooden speaker box in the attic according to @entity8 fire investigators			1
the blaze caused an estimated $ 15 million in damage			0
some have seen the progress on the temple as a catalyst for the rejuvenation of @entity8 's downtown area			0
' there is definitely increased enthusiasm for downtown with this			0
a lot of interest has been piqued from developers and retail outlets wanting to be associated with the temple , ' said @entity173 with the @entity174			0
' the restoration of this landmark is attracting a lot of people who want to see history in the making as the pioneer - era tabernacle is transformed into what @entity79 believe is a ' @entity183			1
'' ' we were just talking about how much more expensive it probably is to do a restoration like this , but it seems really worth it to preserve a building that is so important to @entity8 's history			0
' the project is expected to be completed in 2015 .			0

@entity7 almost destroyed by fire in 2010
building lay *abandoned* until @entity79 *bid* to restore it in an ' *uplifting* ' transformation
project involves *balancing* the building on 40ft stilts
a ' miracle ' of modern engineering
