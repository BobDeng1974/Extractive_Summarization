dressed in overalls and carrying axes , these are the women who helped the @entity4 forces on their way to victory during the @entity7			1
the women , nicknamed the ' @entity9 ' were members of the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , whose job it was to fell trees , work in sawmills and carry out other heavy land duties			1
they were recruited by the @entity17 and replaced the men , who had left their jobs in order to join the armed forces			1
some of the members of the @entity23 walking to work during the @entity7			1
they were recruited by the @entity17 and replaced the men who had left to join the armed forces the women , nicknamed ' @entity9 ' carried out work such as felling trees , working in sawmills and driving tractors home - produced timber was urgently required for industry and the war effort : for pit props and railway sleepers , telegraph poles , aircraft construction , ship - building , gunstocks for the troops , transport packaging for army supplies , charcoal for explosives and gas - mask filters – and coffins			1
it was gruelling , backbreaking work - often carried out in harsh conditions - but more than 8,000 young women , some only in their mid teens , tackled it without a peep of protest			1
girls were officially recruited from the age of 17 - although some who joined were as young as 14 - and came from all kinds of backgrounds and all walks of life			0
and today as the nation fell silent at 11am to mark @entity65 , former @entity9 up and down the country were reflecting on the wartime years with the @entity11			1
one of those who stopped to pause at 11am and remember her time working on the land was 91 - year - old @entity72			2
then 19 - year - old @entity72 , left , signed up to join the @entity11 in 1942			1
today , right , mrs @entity72 , 91 , was reflecting on her time as a @entity73 mrs @entity72 was just 19 when she volunteered for the @entity11 in 1942 , when she was working in an office in @entity75 , @entity76			2
she was then sent to @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , for a month 's training where she was taught how to manually cut down trees			2
after that she was then posted to @entity83 in @entity84 along with two other girls who joined up at the same time			0
there were 8,700 women recruited as @entity9 during the @entity7 and it was 2008 before they received any recognition for their role she explained : ' when i went into the @entity11 i did n't know what was ahead of me			1
' people did n't travel much in those days and moving from the @entity76 area to @entity84 seemed far away from family and friends			0
' but everyone felt the same as they came from far and wide too			0
we all supported each other when someone was homesick or unwell			0
' but despite the tough nature of being in the @entity11 , mrs @entity72 says she has great memories of her time with the other @entity9			2
she explained : ' you had to get used to being told what to do and when to do it although it was n't too regimented			0
leisure time was a sunday and there was dancing on friday and saturday night			0
' the girls all walked four miles to and from the dances except when @entity112 was playing and we were allowed a lift , in all our finery , on the back of a lorry			0
' when the camp was disbanded in 1944 , two of us were kept on and had lodgings in the village of @entity83			0
it was a great part of my life with many fond memories			0
' but despite their hard work , the 8,700 @entity128 received no recognition and it was 2008 before they receive a badge acknowledging their efforts			1
the @entity11 was disbanded in august 1946 , with each girl handing back her uniform and receiving a letter from queen elizabeth , the queen mother , who was their patron			2
however , in 2008 they all received badges in recognition of their efforts and a year later , many were invited to @entity142 for a tea party with the @entity137 and the @entity144			0
last year then marked the final year the veterans of the @entity146 and @entity11 marched past the @entity147 in central @entity148 on @entity149 .			2

women were *encouraged* to join the @entity11 during @entity7
were nicknamed @entity153 and trained to fell trees and work in sawmills
replaced the men who had left their jobs on the land to join armed forces
there were 8,700 @entity128 during the war and were only *honoured* in 2008
