night after night , @entity0 would lie staring at her ceiling through the small hours of the morning			1
sometimes the 63 - year - old would recite the alphabet to herself over and over in an attempt to drop off , but it rarely worked			1
of course , surviving on as little as two hours ’ sleep a night had a profound impact			1
‘ i began to dread bedtime , knowing what lay ahead			0
i felt so frustrated and it became hard to cope , ’ she says			0
alongside hot flushes , memory loss and mood swings , sleeplessness is a surprising side - effect of the change , and one that causes misery to millions of women			1
a recent study found that one in four middle - aged women are n’t happy with the quality of their sleep , while another major piece of research found menopausal women are nearly four times more likely to have insomnia			1
alongside hot flushes , memory loss and mood swings , sleeplessness is a surprising side - effect of the menopause and it ’s not just irritating — lack of sleep has significant health implications and has been linked to obesity , high blood pressure , dementia and cancer			1
@entity47 , professor of behavioural sleep medicine at @entity49 , says : ‘ the menopause or associated @entity52 treatment is a time of major hormonal , physical and psychological change so it can often be a trigger for insomnia			1
levels of both the female hormones , progesterone and oestrogen , drop			0
‘ @entity62 is known as a sleep - promoting hormone , while the reduction in oestrogen can leave you more susceptible to environmental factors that can disrupt sleep , such as light			1
‘ hot flushes with their surge of adrenaline and change in temperature can also disrupt your sleep			2
’ @entity0 , a retired college principal who lives with her husband , @entity77 , in @entity78 , started suffering from insomnia ten years ago			1
‘ it was around the time the menopause kicked in and i was suffering badly with hot flushes			1
i did n’t put two and two together — and there was no information that the menopause could cause sleeplessness			1
‘ i ’d feel tired but then , when i got into bed , it was like a switch had been turned on and i suddenly felt wide awake			2
when i finally did get to sleep , i ’d wake up again after two hours			1
‘ all sorts of ridiculous worries would come into my head			0
before , i ’d always gone to bed at around 10pm and slept through the night			2
’ the resulting exhaustion took its toll on @entity0			1
‘ when the alarm went off in the mornings , i felt so irritable			0
it made me clumsy , snappy and forgetful			0
‘ i had a very demanding job , but i felt so foggy and dazed that everything started taking me much longer to finish			2
and i started spotting mistakes in my work			1
one time i was driving and i had to stop the car because i felt so confused			2
@entity0 's tiredness started to affect both her work and her personality ‘ by the evenings i was just shattered			1
i ’d go to the theatre and as soon as the show started , i ’d be nodding off , no matter how good it was			2
i started staying in more			2
’ while she started @entity52 to battle the other menopausal symptoms , @entity0 assumed she had to put up with sleeplessness			1
she did n’t want to take sleeping pills so tried to find her own solutions — going for 15 - mile walks once a week — but that did n’t work either			1
the problem is n’t just dropping off , but sleeping through the night , too			2
one study found 60 per cent of middle - aged women wake in the night at least once a week			1
they are also statistically more likely to ask their gp for sleeping tablets			0
the average person wakes up six times per night this was the case for secondary school teacher @entity125			1
‘ i always used to sleep like a log and would struggle to get up in the morning , ’ says @entity125 , 60 , a mother of two who lives with husband @entity127 , 61 , an artist , in @entity128			1
‘ now , although i fall asleep easily at around 10.30pm , every night without fail i wake at three in the morning and can not get back to sleep			1
’ all those hours spent lying awake started to take their toll			1
‘ i looked and felt awful , ’ @entity125 says			1
‘ i just could n’t think properly and would be crabby with @entity127			2
secondary school teacher @entity125 spent hours lying awake after she hit the menopause ‘ sometimes , i ’d wake him up in the night , which would really wind him up			1
i became anti-social because i was so neurotic about sleep — if people came round i ’d worry they ’d stay too late			2
’ although @entity125 ’s sleep problems started when she hit the menopause at around 50 , they were n’t prompted by night sweats			1
‘ thankfully , i have n’t suffered with hot flushes , ’ she says			0
‘ so although i think insomnia is linked to the menopause , i would n’t say it ’s confined to those who suffer from hot flushes			2
’ @entity125 and husband @entity127			1
she says sometimes she would wake him up in the night which would really wind him up formerly a writer , @entity125 started researching a book about the menopause : ‘ i spoke to more than 100 menopausal women			1
without exception , they all said they woke up in the night			0
’ over the years , @entity125 has tried everything from acupuncture , hormone replacement therapy , hot drinks and herbal remedies — to no avail			2
at one point , she took sleeping tablets while on holiday despite an aversion to them			0
‘ i was worried about waking up in the hotel and not being able to roam around like i can at home , ’ she says			0
‘ they knocked me out but i did n’t feel refreshed			0
i ’d get quite tearful about it			0
the thing i hated most was feeling disorientated the following day			0
’ @entity125 has tried everything from acupuncture , hormone replacement therapy , hot drinks and herbal remedies in the end , @entity125 learned to simply accept her fate			2
‘ i ’ve found the best thing to do is get up and do something			0
it stops me panicking about how tired i ’m going to be			0
‘ i ’ll polish a mirror , read a book — i ’ve even baked a cake			0
now i understand that sleep patterns change throughout your life and the worst thing to do is panic about it because then it becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy			2
’ writer @entity185 , 52 , also tries to adopt a positive approach to menopausal insomnia			1
but there ’s no denying the anxiety it caused her initially			0
‘ i used to be a really good sleeper and would boast about the fact i needed 12 hours sleep a night , ’ says @entity185 , who lives in @entity191 and has four children , aged from 14 to 25			1
‘ a couple of years ago , i started waking throughout the night — sometimes only getting three hours ’ sleep			1
although i did n’t suffer hot flushes , i knew it must be hormonal			0
‘ i still find that i just ca n’t sleep like i used to			0
quite often i go to bed at 2.30am but am wide awake by 7am			0
‘ i tried taking herbal remedies but nothing made a difference			0
’ like @entity125 , @entity185 has dealt with the lack of a cure by trying to accept the change			1
‘ the worst bit is when the birds start singing at 4am and you realise you ’ve got to get up in a couple of hours , ’ she says			0
‘ but i noticed that it was around this time that i started having epiphanies about aspects of my life			2
so i tried to think of the menopause as a positive change — perhaps i just do n’t need as much sleep			2
’ surely there must be something that can be done ? professor @entity47 says : ‘ by far the most effective long - term solution is @entity221 ( @entity221 )			0
‘ it helps people to think and behave differently in relation to their sleep in such a way that normal good sleep can return			0
if you let your insomnia go untreated , it can continue long after the menopause has finished			0
’ writer @entity185 , 52 , tries to adopt a positive approach to menopausal insomnia as for @entity0 , three months ago she read about an online self - help programme called @entity235 based on the principles of @entity221			1
‘ for the first two weeks you fill in lots of questions about your lifestyle and sleep patterns , then you go on to a sleep deprivation programme			0
i was n’t allowed to go to bed until 1am and had to get up at 7am			0
‘ that ’s been one of the hardest things for me — it ’s really hard not to nap			0
i realised that i ’d got myself into a bad pattern of going to sleep in the day and probably going to bed too early , too			0
‘ i can not tell you the joy i experience just from getting into bed , turning out the light and falling gently to sleep			0
‘ i still have my off days and i know i ca n’t cure it overnight			0
but for now , i ’m delighted , and so is my husband , who ’s politely said i seem to be much happier these days			0

@entity0 , 63 , would survive on as little as two hours of sleep a night
