a mother has beaten odds of a million - to - one by giving birth to a baby who appears to be of a different race			1
@entity5 , 32 , from @entity6 , is @entity7 by heritage , and so was , at first , a little taken aback when she saw her son @entity9 for the first time			1
with his pale skin , green eyes and light brown hair , @entity9 , now three months old , looks like any other new - born baby - but , when seen in his mother 's arms , his uniqueness is obvious			1
recalling the moment she delivered @entity9 in @entity20 on june 1 , his mother told the @entity21 : ‘ the midwife looked at me and looked back down at @entity9 and then at me again and could n’t believe it			1
but you can see from the colour at the tips of their ears what that @entity9 was fully white			2
‘ we have been told i must have been carrying a recessive gene			1
my parents were from @entity7 and , for as far back as anyone can remember ; my family have all been black			0
’ the difference between mother and son is extreme , and doctors believe it may be due to a single gene skin colour is a very strong example of genetic influence			1
it depends on the amount of the pigment melanin found in the skin cells , and this amount is predetermined by the genetic blueprint of each cell			2
there are an infinite number of different skin colours , known as phenotypes			2
these range through black , dark brown , brown , light brown to white skin			1
each expression of melanin has an accumulating effect on skin tone - in other words , the more there is in each parent 's genes , the darker that person will be			2
therefore , a baby 's colour will usually depend on the predominating amount of melanin in their parents			0
although again , it is possible , though fairly infrequent , that dark - skinned parents give birth to a pale - skinned child , or vice versa , if their own parents or grandparentsare paler or lighter than they are			0
@entity83 , 34 , who works as a medical recruitment consultant , was equally as shocked when he first saw his son , who is the couple ’s first child together			0
however , he was primarily just happy that @entity9 was strong and healthy , after he got the umbilical cord tangled round his neck during labour – a potentially dangerous complication			2
‘ the colour of @entity9 ’s skin is of no concern - @entity9 being a healthy and happy baby is what matters			1
’ the couple have been told that they are unlikely to have another white baby if they have further children , due to the extremely rare combination of genes needed			1
the phenomenon is not totally unheard of however			0
in 2010 , parents @entity104 and @entity105 – both black - introduced their white - skinned , blonde - haired daughter @entity106 to the world			0
the couple , from @entity109 , @entity110 , was as baffled as the scientific community at their daughter 's appearance , being unaware of any white heritage at all in either family			1
in 2010 little @entity106 ( centre ) was born to parents @entity104 and @entity105 doctors at @entity119 in @entity120 in @entity121 , where @entity106 was born , immediately ruled out albinism , leading experts to conclude , that like @entity9 , @entity106 ’s colouring must be the result of recessive genes			1
@entity127 says : ' no one in the family is aware of any white blood at all , and i do n't really know how you go about looking any further			0
part of me wants to know what 's happened here , to have an answer to tell @entity106 when she gets older			0
but another part of me thinks that it does n't matter			0
perhaps @entity137 made her like this for a reason			0
' and quite honestly , at the end of the day it does n't matter whether she is white or black or red or green			0
she 's beautiful and healthy , and that 's what is important			0

@entity5 says the midwife did a *double* take when she gave birth
despite her being unaware of any white heritage , son @entity9 is white
both mother and father say all they care about is that @entity9 is healthy
doctors say this extremely rare phenomenon is down to recessive genes
it is likely @entity5 carries a recessive gene for white skin
the chance of this expressing itself is about one in a million
