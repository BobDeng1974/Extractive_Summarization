a young woman whose mother claims she has stage 3 brain cancer is saying she is a ' liar and a fraud			1
' @entity6 went on the @entity8 show to confront her mother @entity9 , who also claims she has suffered 17 strokes , flatlined twice in the past year and at one point in the hospital lost 100 pounds in six days			1
@entity9 says all these things are true , which makes the fact that she is now a self - proclaimed world record weightlifter even more impressive			1
that is not what @entity6 believes however			0
she says her mother has never had cancer			0
instead , @entity6 explains , she had brain surgery in 2010 after a blood vessel burst in her head , leaving her with a plate in her head			0
@entity9 however claims she discovered she had brain cancer in 2012 , and that the doctors ' removed her face , jaw and ear ' to perform surgery			1
they then rebuilt her head using mesh she claims , and she lost the ability to walk and talk following the surgery , and in the six days she was in the hospital went from 185 pounds to 85 pounds			2
she relearned to walk and talk , and this is when she began weightlifting and claimed multiple titles , something @entity6 also claims is not true			2
squalor : @entity6 also takes issue with the way her mother lives and how dirty her home is sad : @entity6 also claims her mother neglects her animals , pointing out one dog can not even open his eye @entity9 says she even won one of these titles a day after getting chemotherapy , but that she now avoids the treatment in favor of cannabis oil			2
that 's not the only issue @entity6 has with her mother , also bring up the horrific condition of her house , and her mistreatment of her dogs			0
one of the poor animals can not even open its eye .			0
