villagers are hoping for a tunnel to be built beneath to tree and the surrounding woodland ‘ they originally planned to dig it up and relocate it but it ’s a 200 - year - old tree and they decided the chances of success were too small to warrant the expenditure			0
’ an @entity4 spokesman said : ' we recognise the significance of the tree and will do all we can to ensure wild pear trees continue to be a feature of the countryside around @entity8			1
' because the hollow lower trunk makes it impractical to move the tree , we instead plan to propagate the cuttings , collect seeds and replant the young trees in the surrounding area			1
' the felled tree will be moved to a newly - created woodland next to @entity54			0
' villagers said they would continue to lobby mps for a tunnel beneath the tree and the surrounding woodland			0
