since the emergence of the @entity4 last summer the popularity of the name @entity2 has had an unsurprising nosedive			1
the list of things unfortunate enough to share a name with the terrorist group known as @entity2 include an @entity11 goddess , a dog on @entity13 - and a street in @entity15			2
however , despite its unfortunate name , @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity15 is lined with million - pound properties			2
how unfortunate ! @entity16 used to be associated with an @entity11 goddess , but now , the world knows @entity2 as something completely different @entity17 , a residential area in the @entity15 borough of @entity24 , is located on the fringes of an area nicknamed @entity27 due to its large population of affluent young families			1
this in combination with the 12 - minute train - ride to central @entity15 has contributed to property prices skyrocketing in recent years - even on @entity16			0
a one - bedroom flat on @entity34 sold for £ 365,000 three years ago , is now estimated to be worth £ 500,000 , according to @entity36			0
a two - bedroom maisonette wold for £ 436,000 in august 2012 , is now worth more than £ 605,000			0
a house with four bedrooms a bit further down @entity16 was sold for £ 610,000 in 2007 , but is now worth £ 1.09million			0
as upper - middle as it gets : @entity16 in @entity17 is located on the fringes of @entity27 in south @entity15 big money : despite its unfortunate name , houses on @entity16 sell for up to £ 1million and a two - bed maisonette will set you back at least £ 500,000 you give love a bad name : since the rise of the @entity53 in june , the word @entity2 has a bad ring to it top quality : @entity16 , located in residential @entity17 in @entity57			1

unfortunately named @entity16 is located in south @entity15
since emergence of @entity2 last year , the name now has other *connotations*
however , the rise of @entity2 seems to have had little *effect* on @entity16
