a fizzy drinks tax could save thousands of children from diabetes , a study has claimed thousands of children would be saved from diabetes , cancer and heart disease later in life if a 20p tax is added to the cost of sugary drinks , researchers have claimed			1
health experts and @entity16 ’s food adviser in @entity17 are pushing the idea under moves by the mayor and local authorities to devolve some taxation powers to the capital			1
academics from the @entity25 calculated the effects of introducing a tax equivalent to 20p per litre in @entity17 with the aim of reducing consumption of the high - calorie drinks over 20 years			1
they calculated the levy would prevent 1,100 cases of cancer in the capital , reduce the number of people who develop diabetes by 6,300 and cut 4,300 from the total of those who suffer from coronary heart disease or strokes			2
the work also suggests the health service in @entity17 would save around £ 39million over 20 years			1
based on these numbers , tens of thousands of disease cases nationwide could be prevented if the 20p per litre tax was adopted across the entire country			1
the figures were released by the @entity51 , which proposes that any revenue generated by the tax would pay for programmes to improve children ’s health			1
@entity57 , campaign co-ordinator of the @entity51 , said : ‘ a duty on sugary drinks of 20 pence per litre would be the most practical and effective way of tackling a significant source of unnecessary calories and sugar in children and young people ’s diets			1
‘ @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 have introduced a sugary drinks duty , and their citizens are reaping the benefits			0
' our politicians can no longer hide behind the idea that it would n’t be popular , or is an untried policy			0
‘ we urge @entity17 ’s mayor and council leaders to include a sugary drinks duty in their review of how @entity17 might manage devolved taxation powers , and to make the case to @entity85 for the introduction of such a duty nationally			1
' more than 60 organisations – including the @entity89 , the @entity90 , the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 – have already backed the campaign			0
@entity96 , who was appointed by mr @entity16 to run the @entity97 , said : ‘ we need a tax on sugary drinks			2
unhealthy : the proposed measure is the latest in a long line to curb deteriorating public health ( file photo ) ‘ sweetened fizzy drinks offer nothing to a city already suffering high levels of obesity - related diseases and dental decay , ’ she said			2
‘ it would be good for our health and the environment if we drank less of them			0
in many areas , @entity17 has already been leading the charge in the battle to eat well			2
' but we also need national action to ensure firms contribute to the overall health bill and encourage consumers to swap to healthier products			0
' soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged four to ten and teenagers			0
a tax of 20p a litre would add around 7p to the price of a can of @entity134 or @entity135			1
the idea is also supported by the internationally renowned surgeon @entity137 , of @entity138			0
@entity139 , the director general of the @entity141 @entity140 , said : ‘ this is a poorly thought out political proposal which will hit the poorest hardest while doing nothing to curb obesity , the causes of which are far more complex than this simplistic approach implies			0
‘ evidence from @entity68 shows that while sales of soft drinks fell after a tax was introduced in 2012 , they have increased since , with sales up 6 per cent in the first four months of this year			0
‘ policy should be based on evidence , not a tendentious report based on a flawed model			0
