there may still be 10 games and more than two months to go until the curtain falls on this season 's @entity4 action			0
but , somewhat farcically , voting for the @entity7 award , has already begun			1
@entity8 , who scored 31 league goals for @entity10 last term before his £ 75million summer move to @entity13 , currently holds the title			1
@entity16 's team of top writers give their verdict on which player they would want to follow in the @entity22 international 's footsteps if they were asked to cast their vote today			1
@entity24 @entity25 @entity28 ’s current @entity27 team is perhaps the most physically imposing he has ever assembled and @entity25 stands out as a giant among men			2
a superb reader of the game , @entity25 can pass the ball well , too			2
he would get in just about every team in @entity35 and that says it all			0
@entity25 , in action for @entity27 against @entity39 earlier this week , has starred for the @entity40 this season @entity41 @entity42 @entity27 have been the best team with immense consistency from @entity25 and @entity44			1
but no - one has made a greater individual impact than @entity42			2
he ’s transformed the mood at @entity48 with his energy and desire , deflected attention from the big - money flops and offered hope for the future as a flag - bearer for the youth system			0
not to mention 26 goals , and an anticipated @entity59 call - up			2
he must finish the season and kick on , but @entity42 seems capable of that			2
each time he seems about to fade , he hits back			0
@entity42 celebrates with his second successive @entity62 on friday @entity42 , pictured celebrating against @entity63 , has scored 26 times for @entity65 this season @entity66 who deserves to be voted @entity68 today ? here ’s my answer to the question : no - one			1
it ’s a nonsense that the players have to vote so soon and shows why the @entity76 award , voted by members of the @entity78 , has more credibility			2
i 'll save my vote until then , thank you			0
but among the contenders : @entity83 , @entity42 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity44 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
voting now is like deciding a @entity91 champion before the quarter - finals are played			2
i want to see how they fare at the business end of the season			0
@entity85 has impressed for @entity96 following his summer switch from @entity13 @entity98 @entity44 it 's close between @entity44 and @entity100 but the brilliant @entity102 shades it thanks to his remarkable injury - free record			1
already this season hazard has pulled on a @entity27 shirt 41 times and has again been superb			0
@entity100 's susceptibility to various issues stops him from becoming @entity111 's first winner of the award			0
@entity44 has played 41 matches for @entity27 this season but has been one of the league 's best players @entity118 @entity42 he deserves it for the surprise element more than anything else - nobody could have predicted his impact at @entity65 this season			1
he lives for the game , thriving on the responsibility of scoring goals for the club and enjoying his relationship with @entity65 supporters			0
next week he will be rewarded with a call into the @entity59 squad			0
@entity134 @entity25 i reserve the right to change my mind in the next few weeks , as @entity44 and @entity85 have both been superb			1
hazard could become one of the game ’s greats			0
but i ’m close to settling on @entity25 , because his position is often under - acknowledged and because he has provided balance to a @entity27 team that had collected flair players while eschewing midfielders who can defend			1
he is a throwback to @entity149 : the aggression , the superb distribution , the instinctive reading of the game and , most of all , those longs legs extending to whip the ball away from an attacking player who thinks he is clear on goal			0
because he is so good defensively , his passing and creativity in forward areas are often overlooked			0
i ’m expecting the more glamorous players to win the awards but i do n’t think any player contributes more to their respective teams than @entity25			2
@entity25 parades the @entity166 trophy with @entity167 after their triumph over @entity65 @entity85 and @entity44 have both been impressive performers for their sides this season @entity171 @entity42 there is nothing dark about the art of @entity42 and a victory for the @entity65 striker would be a victory for football and all of the reasons why we should love the game			1
there are no elbows , no spitting , no intimidating referees - he scores goals for his boyhood club and does so with a smile on his face			2
his brilliant enthusiasm aside , @entity42 is a worthy winner on footballing merit alone and has consistently been the division 's best striker this season			1
his goals have invariably been match - winning and his breakthrough campaign should be crowned with a clean sweep of the annual awards			0
@entity88 has spared @entity202 's blushes on a number of occasions this season @entity167 would win @entity206 's vote @entity207 @entity88 he almost certainly wo n't win it but @entity88 deserves some representation for @entity68 based purely on the fact he has single - handedly and often stunningly rescued @entity202 and kept them in the hunt for a top - four finish			1
@entity213 @entity214 this is one of the toughest to call because the obvious stand - out performers - @entity86 , @entity44 and @entity100 - have missed games or been inconsistent			1
so in a very even field i 'd vote for @entity167 because he 's typified best why @entity27 will be champions @entity220 @entity44 @entity27 are n’t winning too many friends at the moment but it does look like they will win a @entity4 and @entity166 double , and no - one will have contributed more than last season ’s @entity224			1
a supremely gifted footballer , @entity44 deserves the main award this season ahead of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity84 and @entity42			1
@entity228 @entity88 nobody goes to football matches hoping for clean sheets but the @entity202 goalkeeper has produced saves of wonder this season , genuinely entertaining and worthy of repeated replays as much as any goal			0
this award should go to a player who has impacted his team significantly , clearly lifting them higher			0
so far , @entity88 has done that .			0

voting for the @entity7 award has already begun
@entity10 striker @entity8 won the gong last year after 31 league goals
@entity44 , @entity25 , @entity85 , and @entity42 are among the stand - out performers this season
