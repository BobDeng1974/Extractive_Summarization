the temptation is to believe that @entity1 can be rebuilt and will run out at @entity2 on sunday in a @entity4 shirt			1
time is tight , just like @entity1 ’s hamstrings , but the reality is that he will miss the biggest match of the season so far			2
on tuesday night , as @entity4 cantered to victory in this @entity13 clash with @entity14 , they lost @entity15 after just 13 minutes at @entity16			1
he could also be out			0
the serious business is sunday , when @entity19 must pick a team to protect @entity4 ’s unbeaten record in the @entity41			1
‘ i have forbidden the doctor from calling me on my day off , ’ claimed @entity19			0
‘ i will worry about @entity43 on thursday			2
‘ we do n’t cry about injuries , it just represents an opportunity for another player			0
i do n’t like to speak about injured players			0
‘ it 's our philosophy , we do n't cry			0
in this moment we have some problems with players who are not available to play			0
‘ we will prepare the game thursday , friday , saturday to try to be at our best possible level against an opponent which we respect very , very much			0
’ @entity15 scores the opening goal for @entity4 in their 6 - 0 victory against @entity14 on tuesday @entity15 ( second right ) pulls up injured after opening the scoring for his side at @entity16 @entity15 leaves the pitch injured just moments after scoring for @entity4 against @entity14 last season , when they travelled to @entity43 for @entity65 ’ first home game in charge of the champions , he played without a striker			1
this time , now that @entity4 are playing football on the front foot and battering everything in sight , he will travel to @entity2 in search of goals			1
this team knows no other way			0
now that @entity20 has his first goal back in @entity80 football after galavanting around the world , first with @entity82 and then with @entity83 , he could get the nod			2
without @entity1 , spending his days on the treatment table , or @entity15 there are no realistic alternatives			1
@entity20 offers experience and confidence			2
when @entity4 were awarded a 23rd minute penalty , @entity20 asked @entity25 if he could take it @entity1 celebrates after scoring against @entity92 last month but he is now missing through injury @entity1 in action for @entity95 during the @entity97 qualifier against @entity98 on october 12 ‘ if you want me to be honest i do n’t like it and when they do something like that they have to score , ’ added @entity19			1
he did score , as everyone knew he would , by sending @entity14 keeper @entity106 the wrong way			2
it was good to see him back on the scoresheet			0
‘ if the coach wants me i am available , ’ admitted @entity20			2
‘ it was good for my confidence to score , but i am happy because we share the goals around in this team			0
‘ we have a lot of young players in the team , but we have more quality than we had the last time i was here			0
’ @entity20 was down to play 30 minutes against @entity14 , but he ended up on the pitch for a lot longer after @entity15 pulled up after just 13 minutes			1
it is possible the @entity4 legend could start at @entity43 now			1
@entity20 goes high in the air as he jumps over a challenge by @entity14 goalkeeper @entity106 @entity4 manager @entity19 gestures on the touchline during his side 's thrashing of @entity14 video we are playing with confidence - @entity19 those legs are still willing , even at the age of 36 , but it is a big call for @entity19 to make now			1
@entity1 is the joint leading goalscorer ( with @entity135 ) in the @entity41 and his presence in the @entity4 side on sunday would shake that @entity43 defence			1
under @entity140 they are a vulnerable bunch			0
still , at least @entity4 can look elsewhere for goals			0
@entity25 , at the heart of everything @entity4 do well , scored twice as they crushed the spirits of this @entity14 side with a thumping 6 - 0 win			1
by then , @entity20 was blowing hard , but there is still an aura about one of the best strikers in @entity4 ’s history			1
on sunday , there will be a chance to create some more .			0

@entity1 has missed two games in a *row* with a hamstring injury
@entity15 scored for @entity4 in the 6 - 0 victory against @entity14 but left the pitch moments later in pain
@entity20 scored his first goal for @entity4 since his return
