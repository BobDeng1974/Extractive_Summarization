by @entity0 lives are at risk because of a desperate shortage of @entity6 scanners in the @entity7 to diagnose cancer , an international report has found			1
in a bitter irony , it was @entity12 scientists who were instrumental in inventing the scanners which are now credited with saving lives throughout the world			1
yet we have fewer of them than almost all other @entity19 countries – and even developing countries such as @entity21 and former communist states such as @entity23			1
short supply : picture posed by models			0
the @entity12 has fewer scanners than almost all other @entity19 countries - and even developing countries such as @entity21 and former communist states such as @entity23 out of the 32 countries in the @entity28 , which represents industrialised nations , the @entity12 stands 26th			1
our record is even worse on @entity33 – also invented by @entity12 scientists – on which we stand 30th out of 32			1
only @entity35 and @entity36 are below us			0
the figures come weeks after it was revealed suspected cancer sufferers are waiting longer for diagnosis on the @entity7 , reducing their chances of recovery			0
the @entity7 recommends no one should wait longer than six weeks for a diagnostic test			1
but in april , almost 17,000 patients waited longer – more than double the total in the same month last year and the highest for six years			1
some 2,439 waited too long for @entity6 scans , compared with 374 at the time of the last election in 2010 ; with 859 waiting too long for ct scans , compared with 215 in 2010			1
despite billions being pumped into the @entity7 in recent years , @entity12 ’s record on cancer survival is still among the worst in @entity53			1
@entity12 scientists are credited with developing the cancer - detecting scanners which are now more prevalent around the world than they are here			1
@entity6 ( magnetic resonance imaging ) uses magnetism to build a picture of inside the body , while @entity61 ( computed tomography ) uses radiation			2
@entity6 is best for diagnosing tumours in the brain , bones and soft tissues			2
for other cancers , doctors may call for a ct scan			0
the first commercially viable ct scanner was invented by sir @entity72 in @entity73 , where the first brain scan in the world was carried out on october 1 , 1971			0
meanwhile , a team led by @entity78 professor @entity77 built the first full - body mri scanner in @entity80			0
on august 28 1980 it obtained the first clinically useful image of a patient ’s internal tissues , identifying a tumour			0
last week it emerged that , despite not having the money for cancer scanners , tens of millions are spent a year on cosmetic surgery			2
@entity91 , of @entity92 , said : ‘ this report suggests we are at a further disadvantage			0
’ @entity96 , of @entity97 , said : ‘ it ’s not surprising we ca n’t afford modern equipment , after we negotiated a contract that enhanced doctors ’ pay to such a degree all funds go on staff costs			0
’ the @entity28 figures come in its health at a glance 2013 report , which warned : ‘ if there are too few [ @entity6 and @entity61 ] units , this may lead to access problems in terms of geographic proximity or waiting times			2
’ the report shows the @entity12 has only 5.9 mri units per million people , less than half the @entity28 average of 13.3			2
this is dramatically below the 23.7 in @entity120 and 46.9 in @entity121 – one of the countries with the longest life expectancy			0
even in @entity21 there are 10.5 mri scanners per million			1
@entity12 ’s ranking of 26th out of 32 is below @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity23 , the @entity130 and @entity131			1
only @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity35 , @entity135 and @entity36 are below us			0
on ct scanners we are 30th out of 32 countries , in front of only @entity35 and @entity36			2
the numbers concern only @entity7 scanners			0
@entity142 said : ‘ the situation over the last few years has improved in terms of numbers of machines and an increase in the trained work force			0

@entity12 scientists were instrumental in inventing life - saving @entity6 scanners
@entity12 26th on list of 32 industrialised nations - below @entity21 and @entity23
in april 17,000 patients waited too long for a diagnostic test
@entity160 *'s* record on cancer survival is among the worst in @entity53
