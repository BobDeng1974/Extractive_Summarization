just a handful of countries impose a tax like the @entity2 's @entity10 ( @entity10 ) and those that do only charge a fraction of what @entity2 holidaymakers are forced to pay			2
@entity2 holidaymakers pay between £ 13 and £ 91 each , per flight , depending on the route , but other @entity18 countries pay as little as 90p per flight			1
rip - off : families can pay up to £ 91 each , per flight , for long haul journeys , or £ 13 for short haul trips campaign group a fair tax on @entity26 looked at five @entity18 countries that levy a comparable tax - @entity2 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity6 and @entity30			1
the @entity2 has three levels of @entity10 , £ 13.00 a person for short haul flights , like those to most @entity18 countries , £ 69 a head mid-haul , which includes @entity37 and @entity38 and £ 91 each for those going long haul			1
