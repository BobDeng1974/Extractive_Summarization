@entity5 took the children - who are @entity14 - after discovering their foster carers were members of the @entity16 @entity2 which was deemed a ' racist ' party by social workers			1
now the experienced foster parents say they have been blacklisted and are demanding an apology			2
they have said that they will now take legal action after their foster agency said the council had accused them of leaking information to the press about their children and birth parents			1
they told the @entity31 : ' if @entity32 are accusing us of a breach of confidentiality and do not issue a formal apology in order to clear our name we may be forced to seek legal action to protect our future as foster parents			1
' @entity2 has said it will back the couple 's legal action			1
a spokesman said : ' if that black mark is n’t removed , their chances of fostering again are very , very limited			2
' he said @entity2 will ' entirely ” support any law suit , adding : ' we hope it wo n’t come to that			2
we hope that @entity32 council will back down and do the decent thing and apologise			0
' education secretary @entity56 , who ordered an investigation into the matter , has branded the decision to remove the children ' indefensible ' and made ' in the wrong way for the wrong reasons '			0
@entity32 council launched an urgent review when it was revealed that the children had been removed from their foster home in november			0
responding to the couple ’s threat of legal action , a council spokesman said in a statement : ' the council is not and never has been the couple ’s employer			1
' their future employment as foster carers is not a matter for the council , it is a matter for the agency which employs them			0
' earlier this month the birth parents of the three children were revealed to be a @entity87 couple who have had six of their offspring taken away by social workers			0
attacked by all political parties : @entity32 council ( pictured ) social services were accused of acting like ' @entity94 ' and was also criticised for failing to protect scores of young girls how have been sexually abused by street grooming gangs the father accused council staff of ‘ racism ’ and of destroying his family as he told how 20 police officers ‘ raided ’ their home to remove their last four children			0
the authorities have also taken the couple ’s grandchild ( the baby son of their 17 - year - old married daughter ) , bringing the total number now being looked after by the state from this one family to seven			0
their ages range from five months to 11 years			0
the parents , who are happily married and came to @entity16 five years ago , found themselves at the centre of national controversy after the staunchly @entity117 council in @entity32 , @entity118 , discovered that it had sent three of their removed children to live with the foster couple who are @entity2 members			1
through friends , the parents of the @entity32 children say the irony is that despite the council ’s fears of the @entity2 foster couple being racist , it is the council which has picked on them because they are @entity132 , and social workers disapprove of their non-british ‘ lifestyle ’			1
settlers : thousands of eastern @entity136 have moved to @entity32 , @entity118 and the @entity87 couple at the centre of the @entity2 fostering row have accused council staff of ' racism '			2

@entity144 parents say they have now been blacklisted from fostering
