when @entity1 first saw @entity2 at @entity3 , near @entity4 , in @entity5 , she decided to buy it on the spot			1
‘ admittedly i was pregnant and jet - lagged , ’ says @entity1 , ‘ but i thought it was wonderful			2
i loved the pillars inside and managed to ignore all the problems			0
’ @entity1 , who had been brought up in @entity5 , had just flown in from @entity12 , where she had been raising her first two children with her partner , @entity15			1
by the time @entity15 arrived from @entity12 the deal was done			1
he turned up to find he was the owner of an enormous dilapidated building with holes in the roof , broken windows and a sea of pews			2
he said only one word			0
‘ why ? ’ the @entity2 at @entity3 , near @entity4 , in @entity5 , a five - bedroom converted home - still with altar platform and pulpit - is on the market for £ 695,000 but there was another shock in store for @entity15 – one that he could never have predicted			1
while his mother , over on a visit from the other side of the world , was looking through some old documents at the chapel , she made an amazing discovery : she found that it had been built with money from one of their ancestors			1
‘ i ’m actually a fifth generation @entity45 , ’ says @entity15			1
‘ i did n’t know of any family connection with @entity5 so it was a spooky surprise when we discovered it			1
’ the ancestor in question was dr @entity51 , a prolific hymn - writer , whose most well - known works include @entity53 and @entity54			1
the chapel had been built in 1750 with the help of a generous donation from dr @entity51			1
@entity51 was a nonconformist and the chapel , before it was deconsecrated in 1979 because of dwindling congregations , was a @entity62			1
@entity63 , the founder of @entity64 , is said to have often visited it in the 18th century			0
when @entity15 and @entity1 bought it 23 years ago , the chapel had been empty for more than a decade			1
‘ we never planned to buy a wreck or a chapel , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ but my mother was keen for us to come to @entity5 and knew we would n’t be seduced by an ordinary house , so when she spotted this chapel for sale she sent us the details			1
’ after purchasing the building 23 years ago , current owner @entity15 ( pictured with partner @entity1 ) found that @entity2 had been built with money from one of his ancestors , dr @entity51 the scale of the work required was overwhelming and they had to do a lot before they could move in			1
luckily , @entity1 ’s parents live nearby and they stayed with them for six months			0
the chapel had to be re-roofed and the whole building re-plumbed			2
once the basics were done , they moved in and did everything else , including finding furniture at auctions , bit by bit			2
the chapel is now a wonderfully spacious family home , with a vast main living space with 20ft high ceilings and a wide gallery on three sides			2
the big kitchen , which was once the school room , has doors out on to the large garden ( the headstones have been moved to a garden of remembrance opposite )			0
the ground - floor bathroom , once the vestry , has a beautiful roll - top bath and the antique lamp fixed to the wall was given to @entity1 and @entity15 by someone who knew it had originally come from the chapel			1
dr @entity51 composed many popular hymns , including @entity53 at the other end of the chapel from the kitchen , a wall has been put in to slice off space for @entity1 and @entity15 ’s bedroom and en suite shower			1
two other bedrooms are on the ground floor , and upstairs , in the corners of the gallery , are two more rooms , one of which is used as a bedroom and the other a study			2
interestingly , from the outside the chapel looks like a handsome red - brick house – its history is revealed only when you step inside			1
@entity15 and @entity1 both work in the arts , as events producers and consultants , and their two daughters are both artists			2
so it ’s not surprising that the walls are covered in art and the house is full of quirky pieces picked up here and there			0
but what makes the chapel extra special is that , unlike most conversions , the altar platform and rail and pulpit are still in situ			1
the platform is the perfect spot for the baby grand piano , where eldest daughter @entity161 plays and composes			2
a link , perhaps , to her hymn - writing ancestor			0
the whole family agree that the chapel has given them a very happy home for the past 23 years			0
but now that the three children – @entity170 , 25 , @entity161 , 24 , and @entity171 , 22 – have flown the coop , the couple have put it on the market at £ 695,000			1
‘ it ’s wasted without a family , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ the children had a fantastic time growing up here : there was so much space for them to run around and all their friends would come here			0
it was always full of children			0
’ they used to hold @entity184 plays on christmas eve for the whole village , and always have an enormous 20ft christmas tree			0
‘ i did feet slightly guilty converting a chapel into somewhere to live , ’ says @entity1 , ‘ so it was nice to keep those traditions			0
people in the village have a connection to this place – we used to have people coming here looking for their family pews			0
’ where will they go when the chapel is sold ? ‘ we want something that ’s ours and unique , ’ says @entity1			0
‘ what we plan to do is buy a plot of land and build a sustainable straw bale house			0
we could n’t live somewhere ordinary now			0
