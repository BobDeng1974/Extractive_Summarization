' concluding top gear chiefs had not acted in ' bad faith ' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by ' massive government and popular pressure ' , she added : ' it led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle would n't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place			0
