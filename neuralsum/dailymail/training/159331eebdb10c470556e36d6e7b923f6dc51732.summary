an old @entity1 flame flared back up this week after an email surfaced linking the @entity3 to the formation of faulty talking points it previously denied any involvement in , exasperating current and former @entity9 administration officials who had hoped the pandemonium over @entity1 was in the rear view mirror			1
' dude , this was like two years ago , ' @entity13 spokesman @entity12 told @entity16 ' @entity15 on thursday night after proclaiming that he does n't ' really remember ' what changes he did or did n't make to the talking points			1
' dude , this was like two years ago , ' @entity13 spokesman @entity12 said when asked about @entity1 on @entity16 on thursday night the @entity3 has long said it did not knowingly send @entity21 ambassador to the @entity23 @entity22 on national television to say the attack was in retaliation for an @entity28 film when it knew it was an independent act of terrorism			1
@entity31 's original talking points , created by the @entity32 , named @entity33 as perpetrators of the attack			2
at some point in the editing process , that context was taken out , and inaccurate information about the video was inserted in			0
the @entity3 and @entity40 have maintained that they made only minor changes to the talking points such as changing the word ' consulate ' to ' diplomatic facility			2
' but a recently declassified email from deputy national security adviser @entity48 proves that @entity3 communications staff was told that @entity31 would ' underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video , and not a broader failure or policy			0
' that email was ' was explicitly not about @entity1			0
it was about the overall situation in the region , the @entity59 world , ' @entity3 press secretary @entity54 told reporters on wednesday			0
@entity54 again claimed that @entity31 's talking points originated with the @entity32 , not the @entity3			1
that the @entity3 originally classified the email has raised eyebrows and caused concern that the @entity3 changed the talking points for political gain and subsequently tried to bury its tracks			0
with a presidential election just around the corner , a spontaneous response to a disrespectful @entity73 video was favorable to a terrorist attack in response to the administration 's foreign policy strategy , republicans like @entity70 senator @entity69 argue			1
' they understood it was a terrorist attack , that they had a political problem , and were going to handle it politically , ' sen. @entity69 said in light of the new information			0
' did you also change ¿ attacks ¿ to ¿ demonstrations ¿ in the talking points ? ' @entity15 asked @entity12			1
i don ¿ t really remember , ' the former @entity9 flack said on thursday @entity94 tried to press @entity12 on what the @entity13 changed in the talking points as well as when and why			1
' according to the e-mails and the time line , the @entity32 circulates new talking points after they ’ve removed the mention of @entity33 , and then at 6.21 the @entity3 - you - add a line about the administration warning of september 10th of social media reports calling for demonstrations , ' @entity15 told @entity12			1
' true ? ' ' uh , i believe so , ' @entity12 said			0
' did you also change “ attacks ” to “ demonstrations ” in the talking points ? ' @entity15 asked			2
i do n’t really remember , ' the former @entity9 flack said			0
' you do n’t remember ? ' @entity15 asked , prompting @entity12 , who is 33 , to say , ' dude , this was like two years ago			1
we ’re still talking about the most mundane process			0
' @entity15 was not amused			0
' @entity114 , it is the thing that everybody is talking about , ' he shot back at @entity117			0
the newscaster again asked @entity12 if he changed the talking points , at which point @entity12 told him he did not make those changes			2
prior to joining @entity122 for the evening 's show , @entity12 , who now runs a communications shop with fellow @entity9 administration alum @entity126 , flippantly tweeted , ' guessing @ @entity127 invited me to come on @ @entity129 to talk # @entity1 a @entity131 thing since it happened in 2012 but tune in ! ' @entity15 responded five minutes later to @entity12 's tweet explaining that he was invited on the show because ' i figured since you are out of government maybe you can fill in some blanks			2
' after the interview , @entity12 's twitter was flooded with tweets criticizing his attitude toward the terrorist attack that took four lives			2
@entity12 then clarified that , ' if you watch the intv with @ brettbaier i 'm clearly saying i do n't remember who edited a document two years ago			1
