musicals and i rarely mix and , much like first dates , i give them until the interval before i decide if i ’m going to hang around any longer			1
far from making me feel good , @entity5 ’s cheesy plot and schmaltzy songs made me feel slightly sick			2
i walked out , feeling like i ’d met my @entity7			2
i also hated every garish second of @entity9			2
i can not abide the mix of saccharine sweetness , contrived sing - a - longs and false happy - ever - afters which are too often the trademarks of musicals			1
so , six years ago when @entity14 opened in @entity16 ’s @entity15 , i felt a familiar sense of foreboding as we trooped in			1
oh what a night : @entity21 has seen @entity14 , the musical about @entity23 , a whopping 12 times i loved the music of @entity23 , but was certain this would be a clumsy production which would destroy my happy memories of some great songs			1
so how unprepared was i for the emotional rollercoaster that left me gripping my seat , weak with excitement and with tears streaming down my cheeks			1
i do n’t think anybody else in the audience gave me a second glance			2
they were too busy crying , clapping and dancing themselves			2
never before has a rags - to - riches story encompassed such steely determination and bitter loss while managing to be utterly life - affirming			2
that is why — and please do n’t think me mad — i have been to see the show 12 times			1
and it goes without saying no one is more excited at the prospect of seeing the movie version , directed by @entity50 , which has just opened here			2
i only hope it has the same power as the stage show			2
@entity55 : @entity56 and her mother @entity57 so why the obsession ? quite simply , @entity14 makes me feel closer to my mother , @entity57 , who i lost to breast cancer in 1993			1
she was aged just 59			1
@entity63 ’s favourite group were @entity23 , so when i first saw @entity14 in 2008 , i was transported back to the cosy world of my childhood in @entity66			1
there i was , a young girl in my mother ’s council - house kitchen with its formica worktops , swirling lime , orange and yellow @entity72 ’ wallpaper , and the @entity74 blaring out @entity23 hits			1
my younger sister @entity75 and i would sit , transfixed , as our mum twirled around as she made our tea — probably egg and chips — singing out loud			1
mum could n’t carry a tune in a bucket			1
but as soon as her favourite hit , december , 1963 ( @entity84 ) , came over the airwaves , her voice would rise lustily — crashing and falling — as she joined in with @entity88			1
so that first time i saw @entity14 , the sense of her loss hit me like a blow			1
i was instantly taken back in time , and could see her in front of me — stars in her eyes and granite in her voice			1
she was a northern lass who worked in a cardboard box factory — exactly the market those working - class boys , @entity23 , had always set out to enthral			0
she was so proud of me and the career which took me to @entity16 and on to television as a presenter for @entity107			0
even now , when i ’ve had a particularly tough day , i go for a run and talk to her about life			0
i can almost hear her saying : ‘ do n’t worry about it , our @entity21			1
’ meet the boys : @entity21 with the stars of the show ( l to @entity118 ) @entity119 , @entity116 , @entity120 and @entity121 at the @entity122 and when things get really bad , i do n’t reach for wine — i call the box office knowing the show always delivers the message that you must pick yourself up and dust yourself down			1
mum first developed cancer aged 50 , but put up a brave fight and eventually got the all - clear			1
little did we know we would only have her for another six weeks			0
i ’ll never forget when , typically forthright , she said : ‘ i ’m dying , @entity21			1
’ when i said i could n’t cope without her she said : ‘ you are going to have to cope , because you need to look after your dad			0
’ when she went , my dad , @entity136 , was devastated			0
he died of a heart attack two years later aged 65			1
when @entity63 died , my son , @entity138 , who i brought up single handedly , was just eight months old			1
i can only console myself that at least she got to meet him			0
but her death meant , as a new mum , i could n’t ask her all the questions about babies , such as why they wo n’t stop crying ? emotional rollercoaster : every time @entity21 sees @entity14 the memories of her mother mean she is reduced to tears now @entity138 is 21 and has just graduated from @entity149 with a politics degree			1
i dearly wish @entity63 could have seen what he went on to achieve			0
these are the thoughts which flit into my head as i sit watching @entity14 , making waterproof mascara a must before any visit			1
such is the power of @entity23 ’ music , i even named my red setter @entity160 ( pronounced @entity158 ) , after one of @entity63 ’s favourite hits , @entity158			1
i got @entity160 in 1994 , and she was my constant companion over the next 14 years			0
she instinctively comforted me if i was upset , and remained my faithful friend as relationships came and went and as i raised my son			0
my lovely dog died when she was 14 , leaving me utterly bereft , and just the opening bars of @entity158 are enough to reduce me to floods of fresh tears			1
when my girlfriends accompany me to the show , they rest their hands on my shoulder before the song even begins			0
mega fans : many fans of the show have seen it more than 200 times but i find there is something truly uplifting about the story of four poor @entity186 - @entity185 boys who fought their way out of @entity188 to sell 175 million records			2
there are moments in the show where you feel as if your heart is being ripped out			0
@entity88 ’s youngest daughter , @entity195 , died from a drug overdose , and the moment in the musical where he is handed her belongings by a nurse is heart - rending			2
but there ’s humour when the boys lose their virginity , and one - liners such as ‘ never lie to your mother , always lie to your wife			2
’ it ’s a perfect musical for a single girl like me because it fulfils every emotion — every joy and every failure — you have ever felt			0
but it ’s also macho and motivational			0
i was n’t at all surprised to learn that sir @entity217 took the entire @entity219 squad to see the musical two seasons ago			0
i have a wry smile ( as an @entity223 supporter ) when i think of @entity224 and @entity225 sitting there , discreetly dabbing their eyes			0
inspiring : @entity14 spells out the importance of friendship through the upheavals of life other celebrity fans include @entity234 — who like me , hates musicals , and @entity237			1
when the show moved to a new theatre in march , i went to the first performance and spotted @entity241 , the @entity243 girls and most surprisingly , the cast of @entity245			0
they walked in with bright smiles and emerged looking shell - shocked — as if they ’d had a musical epiphany			0
it ’s a sign of my true devotion that i ’ve seen the show twice again since then			0
i even interviewed the cast for my @entity255 radio show			0
i ’m pretty tough with interviewees , but just seeing them reduced me to a star - struck schoolgirl			0
‘ i ’ve seen your show 12 times , ’ i confessed , but they did n’t seem at all fazed			1
later , i discovered that many fans have seen the show more than 200 times — making me look like a mere beginner			2
for my 50th birthday three years ago , i knew exactly how i wanted to celebrate			0
i took 15 friends to the matinee , with a lovely boozy meal afterwards			0
nothing bonds girls together more than seeing a musical which spells out the importance of friendship through the upheavals of life			0
nothing helps mend a broken heart more than seeing inspirational life stories unfurl in front of you — bringing a musical message to fight on , no matter what			0
in the next few weeks , @entity138 will be treated to the show for his graduation and we may even go and see the film together , too			0
will he be moved by the songs ? possibly			0
but will his life be enriched for ever by @entity88 ? it most certainly will			0
and will his mother spend the evening with tears rolling down her face ? undoubtedly			2
for i ’ll be thinking of @entity63 , and how much she would love to be there singing along to her favourite tunes with her daughter and grandson .			2

@entity21 was unprepared for the emotional rollercoaster of @entity14
despite not being a fan of musicals , she has now seen it 12 times
the @entity306 were @entity21 **'s** mum @entity57 **'s** favourite group
@entity57 died of breast cancer in 1993 , aged just 59
@entity21 found the music brings back happy memories of her mother
