by @entity0 last updated at 10:52 pm on 29th november 2011 it seemed the perfect act of revenge - a jilted lover cruelly tattooed a picture of flies over excrement on his ex-girlfriend 's back and the photo swept the internet			2
but @entity12 can reveal all is not quite as it seems with the story of ' @entity16 's poo tattoo '			1
the resident of @entity18 , @entity19 , was reportedly suing her ex-boyfriend and tattoo artist @entity20 for $ 100,000 over the drawing which she eventually found out was of flies over a pile of excrement			1
tall story ? this photograph of a woman with a pile of excrement tattooed on her back was claimed to be @entity30 of @entity19 - but it is sourced from a @entity32 website he was said to be angry at her for cheating on him with a friend and plied her with alcohol before she signed a consent form agreeing a design ‘ at the artist 's discretion ’			1
she wanted an image of @entity43			0
but the story itself - originally reported on the @entity47 website and later followed up by @entity49 newspaper @entity50 , @entity53 website @entity51 and others across the world - has been thrown into doubt			1
the picture of the ‘ tattoo ’ appeared on the @entity60 blog , part of the @entity63 group of websites , as far back as december 2009 , @entity12 can reveal			2
it was sourced from @entity32 social network website @entity66 , which translates as ‘ our class ’ , and the caption on the photo lists the month in @entity32 as january , without a year , and the name of ‘ @entity72 ’			1
a court official at @entity74 , where the lawsuit would most likely have been filed , told @entity12 they had no record of either ms @entity78 or mr @entity20 in their records system			2
is it real ? the story itself - which was originally reported on @entity47 and later followed up by newspapers and website across the world - has been thrown into doubt a search of that court 's database and of those of the surrounding civil courts by @entity12 also threw up no matches for either the defendant or plaintiff			1
in addition the @entity94 website reported that a spokesman for @entity97 , which covers the @entity18 area , said he did not know about the reported lawsuit			0
' i was passed out for most of the time , and woke up to this horrible image on my back ' what @entity30 is quoted as saying in the @entity47 article from november 21 , ms @entity78 is quoted			0
but no contact address , email or phone number is listed for the website			0
‘ he tricked me by drinking a bottle of cheap wine with me and doing tequila shots before i signed it and got the tattoo , ' she is quoted as saying			0
‘ actually i was passed out for most of the time , and woke up to this horrible image on my back			0
’ the photo has gone viral since it was picked up by the mainstream media , but it now appears the image has been floating around blogs for years and there is no civil lawsuit as has been reported .			0

@entity16 ' suing ex-boyfriend for $ 100,000 after he drew tattoo on her '
@entity20 was ' angry at her for cheating on him with long - time friend '
but story has been thrown into doubt as no court records are held on case
in addition the photo has been found *published* from a @entity32 website in 2009
