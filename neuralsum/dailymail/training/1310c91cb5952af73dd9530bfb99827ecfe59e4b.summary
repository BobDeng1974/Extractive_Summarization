by @entity0 published : 10:25 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 07:52 est , 11 october 2012 @entity1 hopes to deliver a knockout blow to president @entity4 's hopes of re-election if he prevails in tonight 's debate in @entity7			1
while the @entity10 campaign has been publicly playing down the chances of representative @entity1 , chairman of the @entity12 , scoring a major victory in the vice-presidential debate , privately hopes are high that he could do very well			1
and if the pictures in the next edition of @entity17 of the vice-presidential candidate working out in december 2011 are anything to go by , he 's pumped up for the ' thrill in the @entity21 ' , in @entity22			0
tough guy : @entity1 , pictured here demonstrating his workout technique last year , is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to @entity4 's re-election hopes tonight			0
photo credit : @entity28 for @entity17 high stakes : college students act as stand - ins for vice president @entity32 and @entity33 vice presidential nominee @entity1 as @entity32 and @entity1 prepare for their first debate			1
photo credit : @entity28 for @entity17 @entity32 , who was a senator for 36 years , is legendarily verbose and prone to verbal slips which have been a boon to the @entity10 campaign - most particularly when he said @entity33 wanted to ' put y'all back in chains ' and when he said the middle class had been ' buried ' under @entity4			1
@entity1 , just 42 , is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new @entity33 generation , a policy expert steeped in the minutiae of the economy and who entered @entity47 in 1999 when he was just 28 - two years younger then @entity32 was when he became a senator in 1972			1
feeling good : @entity33 are more confident than @entity49 going into the vice presidential debate a new @entity52 poll has found that voters view @entity32 less favourably than @entity1 and much worse than they did when he debated the 2008 @entity33 vice- presidential candidate @entity54			1
by a 40 per cent to a 34 per cent margin , voters expect @entity1 to beat @entity32 at their thursday debate in @entity22 , @entity7			1
among independents , 42 to 25 per cent believe @entity1 will win			2
this could create an expectations problem for @entity1 - much as was the case for @entity4 , who was heavily favoured by voters before he was trounced by @entity10 in the first presidential debate in @entity64			1
at the weekend , @entity1 said of @entity32 : ' he 's fast on the cuff , he 's a witty guy			2
he knows who he is and he 's been doing this for 40 years			0
so you 're not going to rattle @entity32			0
' betting big : expectations are high among voters that @entity1 , 42 , will win the debate against @entity32 , 69 , even though @entity1 has far less debate experience than the vice president hedging expectations : trying to tamp down expectations that he will beat @entity32 in the debate , @entity1 said of his opponent , ' he 's been doing this for 40 years			1
so you 're not going to rattle @entity32 ' @entity10 tried to damp down @entity1 's experience , telling @entity79 : ' i do n’t know how @entity1 will take on the debate			1
obviously the vice president has done 15 - 20 debates in his lifetime — he is an experienced debater — i think this is @entity1 ’s first debate			1
i may be wrong , he may have done something in high school , we do n’t know			0
' but , it will be a new experience for @entity1 , but i am sure he will do fine			0
frankly , he has policy , facts , and results on his side			0
so i think you find in the analysis people make the assessment on these debates not so much on the theatrics or smoothness of the presenter , but the policies and pathways being described			0
' popularity contest : a new @entity52 poll has found that voters view @entity32 less favourably than @entity1 hoping for the best : @entity10 is also trying to tamp down expectations of @entity1 's debate performance , saying , ' i think this is @entity1 ’s first debate			1
i may be wrong , he may have done something in high school , we do n’t know ' charmer : @entity1 is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new @entity33 generation in fact , according to @entity118 , @entity1 has taken part in at least eight debates during his 14 years in @entity47 - though none of them anything like as high - profile as thursday 's clash , which could be seen by as many as the 67 million who watched @entity10 and @entity4 in @entity64			1
according to @entity52 , @entity32 , whose role in the campaign is as attack dog and as the man who can connect with blue - collar voters , is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters			0
four years ago , when he faced @entity54 , his favourability rating was 53 per cent			0
@entity10 has leapt to level pegging - or even into the lead - in national polls since his much - praised debate performance in @entity64			2
while @entity4 still holds slim leads in battleground states , his campaign badly needs to alter the trajectory of the race			0
@entity32 has the opportunity to do that but traditionally vice-presidential debate , while they have provided entertainment and some big moments , have not had an appreciable effect on the general election result			2
losing ground : @entity32 is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters compared to four years ago , when he faced @entity54 and his favourability rating was 53 per cent in 1988 , senator @entity155 of @entity156 delivered one of the most famous put - downs in political history			2
when senator @entity160 , then vice-president @entity162 's running mate , said he had nearly as much congressional experience as @entity164 , @entity155 pounced			2
he said : ' senator , i served with @entity164 : i knew @entity164 ; @entity164 was a friend of mine			0
… senator , you 're no @entity164			0
' @entity160 responded lamely that this was ' really uncalled for ' and his political career arguably never recovered but in the november election , the @entity173 @entity33 ticket was victorious over governor @entity175 of @entity176 and @entity155 , the @entity49 ticket .			0

expectations are high that @entity33 vice presidential nominee @entity1 will win the debate against vice president @entity32
@entity32 , a senator for 36 years , is a far more experienced debater than @entity1 , who is *27* years younger than @entity32
@entity33 nominee @entity10 is tamping down expectations that @entity1 will win the debate to avoid *negative* *fallout* if his running mate fails to impress
