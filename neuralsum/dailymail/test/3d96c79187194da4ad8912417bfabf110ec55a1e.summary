@entity0 , having bravely lost his two challenges to @entity2 in @entity3 , now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion			2
only this time the elder of @entity9 's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title , even though it is against a far more formidable champion			0
@entity14 , still ranked by many among the top five pound - for - pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring , sees @entity0 as the ideal warm - up opponent , possibly before a rematch with @entity21			1
@entity0 ( right ) throws a punch towards @entity2 during their title fight in @entity25 in february @entity14 ( left ) poses with his many title belts after defeating @entity27 in november 2013 @entity28 could have had his much - craved @entity29 ... if @entity30 had not been so ' disrespectful ' , claims @entity32 's dad @entity31			1
@entity34 , @entity35 - based trainer of both @entity14 and @entity32 , says : ' @entity0 is who we want and i 'm told it 's a done deal			1
but it wo n't be for @entity14 's belt even though it will be over the 12 - round championship distance			0
' the @entity44 have ordered their two super-middle world champions – @entity14 ' super , ' @entity21 ' regular ' – to meet in a unification fight			1
@entity21 declared willingness if @entity14 returns the compliment by travelling to the @entity50 , having won their first meeting in the @entity53			2
@entity14 ( left ) lands a left jab on @entity21 before going on to win their title bout in @entity57 in 2011 @entity21 ( left ) stands alongside @entity58 before a television appearance in @entity9 last july @entity14 said he would make the away trip but only as far as @entity61 , not to @entity62 where @entity21 has long desired to box on his hometown @entity65			1
@entity34 declares : ' @entity14 would have gladly taken @entity21 straight away			2
' but now it appears the @entity44 are granting the so - called @entity14 licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights , in his native city across the @entity71 from @entity72			0
@entity21 , meanwhile , is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the @entity77 , against the namesake son of @entity80 legend @entity79			1
step into @entity82 's @entity81 , @entity0			0
good luck to him , in every sense of the phrase			0
@entity86 ( centre ) celebrates after winning the @entity89 @entity88 in june 2011			0

@entity14 sees @entity0 as the ideal warm - up opponent
it could possibly come before a @entity14 rematch with @entity21
@entity14 has not fought since beating @entity27 in november 2013
@entity21 is turning his attention a first appearance in @entity77
