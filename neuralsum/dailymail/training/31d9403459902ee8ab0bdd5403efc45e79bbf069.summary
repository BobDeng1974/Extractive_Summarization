parenting website @entity1 has released its list of @entity3 of 2014 , and just like last year , it 's @entity4 for a girl and @entity6 for a boy			1
but a number of more obscure baby names such as @entity11 and @entity12 are fast - climbing the ranks - character names from @entity14 and @entity8 respectively - and @entity1 has put this trend down to the ' @entity17 effect			1
' ' this is the year of the binge - watching baby name , ' said the site 's global editor in chief , @entity20			0
' when you spend 16 hours in one weekend binge - watching your favorite series , you ca n’t help but fall in love with the characters ’ names			0
' binge - watching baby names : while the top three names for boys and girls have remained the same as last year , the biggest trend for rising monikers in 2014 appears to be related to popular tv shows based on the names of more than 400,000 babies born in 2014 to moms registered to the site , the top three names have n't moved since last year			1
@entity4 , @entity41 , then @entity43 top the girls list for the third year in a row , while @entity6 , @entity46 and @entity47 hold their own at the top of the boys list for the second year running			1
the correlation between baby names which are shooting up in popularity , however , and current trending ' binge - watch shows ' is undeniable , according to ms @entity20			2
nearly 20 percent of moms surveyed on their naming tactics found inspiration from tv show characters , and 16 percent looked to actors and actresses for great baby name ideas			0
@entity75 @entity77 's @entity76 - winning hit @entity14 seems to have influenced a spike in popularity for baby names shared by its lead characters			1
on the 2014 boys list , @entity83 is up 19per cent from 2013 , @entity11 is up 16per cent and @entity85 is up 11per cent ; while for girls , @entity86 is up 14per cent and @entity65 is up 13per cent			2
and parents are n't just being influenced by character names , they 're looking to the actors too			2
@entity92 , who plays @entity86 in @entity14 , may also be responsible for a 12per cent popularity spike for the name ' @entity95 ' and a whopping 65per cent spike for the name ' @entity92			0
' @entity8 character names , primarily girls of course , also saw a rise in popularity this year			1
@entity12 is up 67per cent , @entity104 is up 35per cent , @entity103 is up 28per cent and @entity105 is up 19per cent from 2013			0
tv : the name @entity83 , shared by @entity109 's character in @entity14 ( center left ) enjoyed a 19per cent rise in popularity this year , while @entity86 , shared by @entity92 's character ( center right ) was up 14per cent popular characters : @entity12 ( top right ) is up 67per cent , @entity104 ( third from bottom left ) is up 35per cent , @entity103 ( third from top right ) is up 28per cent and @entity105 ( third from top left ) is up 19per cent from 2013 @entity121 's @entity120 may have contributed to a surge in names including @entity124 , up 44per cent , @entity125 , up 25per cent , @entity126 , up 22per cent , @entity127 , up 15per cent and @entity128 , up 14per cent			1
@entity6 , this year 's top boys baby name , is a moniker shared by @entity132 character dr @entity125 , who made his entrance in the show 's sixth season			1
but other character names from the show including @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 have seen an increase in popularity on this year 's list			1
@entity146 's @entity145 seems to have pushed the name @entity148 up by 29per cent since 2013 , while the voice behind the animated character , @entity150 , may be the reason for ' @entity150 ' making its way onto the 2014 list for the first time , having not appeared on the 2013 list			0
real - life : the name @entity148 , shared by @entity146 's much - adored @entity145 character ( left ) is up 29per cent since 2013 , while the name ' @entity150 ' made its debut on the list this year and is shared by @entity148 's voice , @entity150 ( right ) looking to tv for baby naming inspiration , or formally to the @entity166 , is nothing new			2
the name ' @entity170 ' , for example , saw a rise in popularity at the height of actress @entity175 's fame in the 50s and 60s , and has n't picked up steam again since after her death , according to @entity179			0
but for parents who are n't binge - watching tv this year , perhaps they 're traveling instead			0
' destination names ' accounted for the other major 2014 trend , according to @entity1			2
