when her weight began creeping up , and her trim size 10 frame ballooned to a fuller size 16 , @entity0 was left confused			1
the university student began to pile on the pounds in her first year			2
while enjoying the student life , miss @entity0 said she could n't account for her drastic weight gain			1
but after waking one morning to find her bed covered in dozens of food wrappers , it dawned on the 20 - year - old - she had been gorging in her sleep			1
she has since been diagnosed with a medical condition called nocturnal sleep eating disorder - sleep walking while also carrying out a sufferer 's conscious desires			1
after waking up one morning surrounded by food wrappers she realised she was sleep eating the now third - year student had noticed her weight increasing as she went from a svelte size 10 to a fuller size 16 by the end of her first year now in her third year at the @entity18 , miss @entity0 said : ' i had absolutely no idea why i was putting on weight			1
' and i used to get in massive rows with my flatmates about all this food that was going missing - i was adamant i had n't eaten anything			2
' it was only when i woke up one morning surrounded by chocolate bar wrappers that i realised i must have been sleep - eating			1
' she said her local gp diagnosed the problem , which is listed on her @entity39 medication as a potential side effect			0
miss @entity0 has since stopped taking the drugs as often in a bid to reduce the effect			2
the philosophy and world religion student told her student newspaper @entity46 : ' i used to have to take @entity48 for @entity39 - one of the side effects is that it completely suppresses your appetite			2
' when i was at boarding school , we had our tuck box at the bottom of our beds , and i would wake up when the medication wore off and feel ravenous , so i 'd eat as much as i could			0
' but when i got older , i stopped needing the medication as often , and because i did n't have any food in my uni room , i did n't think that i was waking up hungry any more			0
' when the penny finally dropped that i was a sleep eater , i had stayed round a friend 's house and in the morning there was a completely empty selection box - and the bed was filled with wrappers			1
' during her midnight feasts , miss @entity0 gorges on thousands of calories , eating fatty snacks , including crisps , chocolate bars and nuts - despite hating the taste of them			1
she said : ' i 'm a bit allergic to peanuts - they make my face swell a bit - so i always avoid them			0
' but there have been some mornings where i 've woken up and my whole face had ballooned , so i must have eaten them in the night			0
' one of my housemates had been given a big bar of @entity87 by her boyfriend as a treat - but i managed to eat it and wake up the next morning with my face covered in chocolate			1
miss @entity0 , pictured at her heaviest , has since been diagnosed with nocturnal sleep eating disorder the condition is a form of sleep walking , where sufferers act out their conscious desires while they are asleep			1
miss @entity0 said as well as crisps , chocolate and nuts , she has also been known to eat half a wheel of cheddar cheese and four helpings of spaghetti bolognaise ' we laugh about it now , but i still have to regularly go to the shop to replace my flatmates ' food			1
' the weirdest thing i 've ever eaten in a night is a wheel of cheddar cheese			2
' as well as making her way through the snack cupboard , miss @entity0 has devoured four portions of spaghetti bolognaise and even makes toast			1
also known as sleep - related eating disorder , sleep eating is a combination of parasomnia and an eating disorder			1
it has been described as a state of sleepwalking that includes behaviours connected to a person 's conscious wishes or wants			0
this is according to dr @entity132 , assistant professor of psychiatry at @entity134			0
the condition is thought to be closely related to night eating syndrome ( @entity136 )			0
where it differs is in the fact those suffering nes are completely awake and aware of their binge - eating habits			2
those suffering nocturnal sleep eating disorder are unaware of their actions			1
dr @entity132 noted both disorders are fairly common , in around one to five per cent of adults , and are predominantly found in young adult women			0
they are chronic illnesses and cause weight gain , sleep disruption and shame over loss of control over food intake			1
she said : ' it is n't really seen as an eating disorder , apparently it 's more of a parasomnia			1
' basically , my body is conditioned to be hungry in the night and want food - even if i do n't			0
' it 's sleep - walking , rather than an actual eating disorder			1
' i 've started locking myself in my room now , with lots of healthy snacks - but i still manage to get out and raid the fridge			0
' my flatmates think i 'm mad , but i 'm always apologetic so they do n't mind too much			0
' i try and combat all the food i eat by going to the gym as much as possible			0
' her flatmates , @entity177 and @entity178 , have to try and convince miss @entity0 to not eat their food , but feel they are fighting a losing battle			2
miss @entity177 said : ' if there 's anything that we do n't want her to eat we have to tell her			0
' we just have to hope that her subconscious is listening and that she does n't eat our good food			0
' the funny thing is that she 's forever going to @entity187 in the morning to replace what she 's eaten of ours			0
' the ultimate fear is that she 'll cook something during one of her episodes			0
' we do n't want her burning the flat down			0
' miss @entity0 , who said she thinks she sleep eats about three nights a week , added : ' i 've never actually been caught in the act , but most nights i sleep naked , so that 's probably a blessing			2
