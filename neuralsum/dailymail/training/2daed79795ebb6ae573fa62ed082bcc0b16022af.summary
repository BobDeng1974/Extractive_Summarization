when , on monday morning , @entity0 reflected on his 90 the day before at the @entity1 , what lingered was not his answers to the inevitable questions about his height or about the patronising dismissal of his talents by one or two			1
no , it was his frustration			0
built like a pole he may not be , but in that moment @entity0 was nothing less than totemic			2
his frustration lay in his treatment by the selectors , who had previously granted him only two one - day internationals in @entity16 and a couple of @entity18 against @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
thanks , in other words , a bunch			0
@entity24 ( right ) and @entity25 are both viable options to lead @entity27 in one - day intrnationals @entity27 's squad are preparing for the fifth odi against @entity31 in @entity32 on wednesday @entity24 returns to lead the team after serving a one - match ban for @entity27 's slow over-rate in the series yet in @entity38 ’s stultifying heat and humidity he did for @entity27 what he has been doing for some time for @entity41			1
to express surprise at the power of his hitting was to admit to being out of touch			0
frustrated , @entity0 ? then join the club			2
for it took @entity27 until the fourth one - dayer of this series to stumble across the batting line - up most likely to unnerve opponents at the @entity52			1
alas , no sooner has something promising been unearthed than it will be put back in its box : @entity24 returns on wednesday after serving his over-rate ban , and the selectors will be almost back to where they started , agonising over @entity58 and trying to convince themselves that the captain really is the answer			1
for more musings on @entity27 ’s tour of @entity31 and other matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity65 @ the_topspin			1
the problem @entity27 have is that the retention of @entity24 is not completely devoid of logic			1
in 66 one - day internationals as captain , he averages nearly 40 , with a strike - rate of 80 ; his win / loss ratio of 1.25 is better than @entity27 ’s overall 1.02			1
to point this out is not to be part of some conspiratorial nexus between the @entity77 and the press			0
but an average of 40 and a strike - rate of 80 are reasonable figures only when compared to the @entity27 one - day captains and openers who came before him ; @entity27 ’s fans want them to keep pace with a changing game			1
and that ratio of five victories for every four defeats will not win you a @entity52 – let alone get you beyond the quarter - finals			2
@entity25 has thrived with the bat in @entity24 's absence and is presenting a case to be captain at the @entity52 @entity0 ( right ) is another player who made the most of @entity24 's ban , scoring 90 in @entity38 the @entity77 top brass think it is too late to change , while promising to change should @entity27 flop in @entity102 and @entity103			1
they admired the resilience @entity24 showed during the test series against @entity107 , and think there is more chance of him repeating the trick with the one - day team than there is of new - look side lifting the trophy			1
again , there is logic here			0
you may not agree with it – and most do not			0
but the thought process is not quite the finger - crossing exercise some have discerned			2
the problem – and it has held @entity124 cricket back at various stages over the years – is conservatism			0
yes , a late change of plan could end up backfiring			0
but the safety - first option – and that is what @entity24 , for all his qualities , represents – is less likely to take the rest of the world by surprise			1
on february 14 in @entity138 , @entity102 's opening bowlers would rather be faced with @entity24 than @entity58			1
they know what they ’ll be getting			0
in fact , @entity27 should consider one or two of the so - called risks they have already taken this year			1
critics said @entity144 should not have batted at @entity145 in the test side			0
they said @entity147 was being messed around			0
they were n’t convinced by @entity149 at the top of the one - day order			0
the selectors can be bold			0
but when it comes to the captain , they lose their nerve			0
one argument has been that @entity25 has been in no sort of form to replace @entity24 as captain			1
yet his 47 - ball 62 on sunday took his record as one - day leader to 427 runs at 71			0
the armband acted as an adrenaline shot			0
an on - song @entity25 will be central to @entity27 ’s chances at the @entity52 , and so far the evidence suggests he ’s more likely to be singing sweetly if he ’s captain			1
this columnist wrote a few months ago that @entity24 should have quit one - day cricket after the test win against @entity107 , put his feet up , and prepared for 17 tests in nine months starting in april			1
instead , his own stubbornness ( both a strength and a weakness ) and the @entity77 ’s fearfulness have recreated the mood that characterised the summer , when @entity24 ’s leadership filled the back pages and blogs on an almost daily basis			2
we keep hearing that conditions in @entity102 and @entity103 are different from those in @entity31 , as if a change of scene will automatically benefit @entity27			1
last time they played a one - day series in @entity102 , earlier this year , they lost 4 - 1			1
anything else is just wishful thinking			0
win all eight issues of the nightwatchman ! the @entity194 has got hold of a special bundle of the much - loved cricket quarterly – all eight issues of it – and is offering it as a prize to the first correct answer drawn at random to this uplifting question : - how many @entity204 games in 2014 did @entity202 lose by an innings ? please email your answer to @entity208 by 5pm on monday , december 15			0
for more information on how to make @entity212 the perfect @entity211 gift , click here : @entity214 @entity27 too clever by half it made some kind of sense for @entity27 to omit @entity219 from the third one - day international in @entity221			1
the boundaries had been brought in , there was rain in the air , and @entity27 knew what he brought to the perennial party			2
victory there meant the decision attracted little scrutiny			0
but to leave him out of sunday ’s match in @entity38 was too clever by half			0
@entity27 knew in advance that the @entity1 pitch would be slow and low , but were swayed by the desire to have another look at @entity240 , who was duly out for six and bowled two overs for 21			2
the best way of preparing for the @entity52 is to start winning a few matches			0
on a turning track , @entity219 is in @entity27 ’s best team			1
instead , they put the needs of a struggling all - rounder ahead of the best interests of the side			0
no wonder @entity25 sounded nonplussed in the post-match press conference			2
@entity219 has been left to bowl in the nets by @entity27 - but the spinner deserves a place in the team @entity258 , all - @entity260 hero when @entity258 walked off the @entity261 earlier on tuesday , having retired hurt on 60 during the opening day of the delayed @entity18 series against @entity107 because of his bad back , he was treated to a standing ovation			1
one of the many touching aspects of @entity102 ’s response to the death of @entity270 has been the way in which @entity258 – previously regarded as a bit too metrosexual for some @entity260 tastes – seems finally to have been accepted , no questions asked			1
they probably should n’t have been asked in the first place			0
@entity258 walks back to the @entity261 dressing room after retiring hurt against @entity107 @entity278 fed up with @entity279 last week , you ’ll be aware , @entity279 described @entity281 on @entity65 as a ‘ woodpecker ’			1
@entity281 ’s incessant coaching style , implied @entity279 , was to blame for @entity25 ’s recent struggles ( this was before @entity25 made 62 in 47 balls in @entity38 )			1
if a journalist dares to criticise @entity279 , it is apparently because he or she has got an axe to grind			2
so let ’s hand over to @entity292			0
‘ i like @entity279 , ’ said @entity292 on his podcast			2
‘ but he just has to let it go			0
‘ we know you do n’t like @entity281 , we know you got sacked and we know you do n’t play for @entity27 any more			2
but it must be exhausting sat in front of the television hating everyone			0
@entity279 continues to watch - and criticise - @entity27 following his sacking from the team			1

@entity27 face @entity31 in fifth odi in @entity32 on wednesday
captain @entity24 returns to the team after one - match ban
but @entity24 's return creates problems for @entity27 's selectors
@entity0 and @entity25 flourished in his absence
@entity219 deserves spot in team after snub in previous @entity317
@entity258 is accepted by all of @entity102 after @entity321 *tragedy*
@entity279 needs to let go and stop sniping at @entity27
