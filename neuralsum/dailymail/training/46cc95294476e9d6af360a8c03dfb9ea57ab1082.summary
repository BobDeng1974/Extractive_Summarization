by @entity0 @entity1 has started to remove search results , following last month 's ' right to be forgotten ' ruling			1
@entity5 's top court ruled that people have the right to have ' inadequate ' and ' irrelevant ' results about them wiped from the web , which led to the tech giant being bombarded with requests			1
searches for people ’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘ may have been removed under data protection law in @entity5 ’			1
this warning appears on all results , regardless of the name that has been searched for , and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted			1
@entity1 has started to remove search results , following last month 's ' right to be forgotten ' ruling			1
users now see a message that reads results ' may have been removed ' ( pictured )			1
this warning appears on all results , regardless of the name that has been searched , and is not an indicator they have requested links be deleted a @entity1 spokesman told @entity38 : ‘ this week , we ’re starting to take action on the removals requests that we ’ve received			1
‘ this is a new process for us			0
each request has to be assessed individually and we ’re working as quickly as possible to get through the queue			0
‘ we ’ll continue to work with data protection authorities and others as we implement this ruling			0
’ last month ’s decision by the @entity49 , which affects 500 million citizens , requires that search services remove information deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ' - and failure to do so can result in fines			1
@entity5 citizens can submit take - down requests directly to internet companies rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling			2
if a search engine elects not to remove the link , a person can seek redress from the courts			2
last month 's decision by the @entity49 requires that search services remove information deemed ' inadequate , irrelevant or no longer relevant ' and failure to do so can result in fines			1
the ruling was made by the @entity71 , pictured under the @entity73 , @entity72 includes the ‘ right to be forgotten and to erasure ’			0
under @entity72 17 , people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘ obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data			0
' this particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child , when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected , the person who owns the content withdraws their consent , the storage period has expired , or if it was gathered illegally			1
the @entity96 defines ‘ data controllers ’ as ‘ people or bodies that collect and manage personal data			0
’ the @entity100 means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘ take all reasonable steps , including technical measures ' to remove it			0
if a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined			0
last month , a @entity38 investigation uncovered that a man convicted of possessing child pornography , a misbehaving politician seeking re-election and a doctor with bad reviews , were among the flood of people who contacted @entity1 demanding that their internet histories be deleted			1
legal experts have commented that the criteria for determining which take - down requests are legitimate , is not completely clear from the @entity96 court ’s decision			0
@entity1 has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and last week sent notifications to people who requested a removal , asking them to bear with the search engine			1
it began removing the first results under the @entity5 data law yesterday , and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective			2
@entity1 is starting its work now to show good faith in complying with the ruling , which it did not greet with enthusiasm last month			1
following the ruling , @entity1 executive chairman @entity142 told the company ’s annual shareholder meeting : ' there 's many open questions			1
’ ' a simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know			0
from @entity1 's perspective that 's a balance			2
' @entity1 believes having looked at the decision , which is binding , that the balance that was struck was wrong			2
’ the company is now keen to be transparent about the modification of its search results , which is why it is showing the message : ‘ your results may have been modified under data protection law in @entity5 , ’ for all name search results , expect for celebrities			1
this is so that notices do not appear next to certain individuals , but the notice could evolve over time			0
@entity1 is also notifying people who made ‘ right to be forgotten ’ requests that have been turned down , as well as those where more information is required			2
the tech giant is not new to notice - and - takedown removals , to do with defamation , for example			0
it also has experience dealing with take - down requests in its @entity185 video website , which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights			0
but the ruling marks an entirely new process for search engines			0
@entity1 is the dominant search engine in @entity5 , commanding about 93 per cent of the market , according to @entity195 global statistics			2
@entity197 's @entity196 has 2.4 per cent and @entity198 has 1.7 per cent			0
a spokesman for @entity197 's @entity196 told @entity38 : ' we ’re currently working on a special process for residents of the @entity71 to request blocks of specific privacy - related search results on @entity196 in response to searches on their names			1
' given the many questions that have been raised about how the recent ruling from the @entity49 should be implemented , developing an appropriate system is taking us some time			2
we ’ll be providing additional information about making requests soon			0
