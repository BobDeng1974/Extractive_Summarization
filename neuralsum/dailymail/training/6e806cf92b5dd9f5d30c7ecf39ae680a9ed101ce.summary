@entity1 chief @entity0 plotted to attack @entity2 in a bizarre plot involving a manned space rocket dropping a dirty bomb over the @entity6			1
vying for @entity11 's attention , the head of the @entity9 air - force , @entity0 , set up a lab and a team of leading scientists to explore the possibility of the radioactive attack on @entity18 soil			1
@entity0 read the work of maverick @entity21 engineer , @entity20 and particularly his belief that a space plane could be built			1
@entity2 : the @entity24 wanted to attack the @entity18 but they lacked long - range bombers capable of covering the distance			1
they explored a rocked - propelled spacecraft as a way to reach and bomb @entity2 ( pictured ) the head of the @entity30 commissioned him and other leading physicists to explore the plane , which he then wanted to arm with a radioactive bomb capable of doing untold damage to @entity18 's most populous city			2
leading historians told the @entity38 that @entity0 may have been gullible for believing the far - fetched plan would work , but much of the research which went into the project paved the way for modern space travel research and the space shuttle program			1
' @entity20 would greatly influence post-war thinking about space travel in the @entity18 , ' dr @entity45 , a space historian , told the @entity49 newspaper			1
' a whole series of highly classified space - plane concepts were developed based on his theories			1
' @entity53 : @entity20 ( left ) devised plans for the aircraft known as the @entity53 ( right ) that could reach @entity18 via space			2
@entity0 wanted the craft to be capable of dropping a ' dirty bomb ' on @entity2 ' his work certainly had an influence on aspects of the @entity63 programme			1
' @entity0 believed the rocket plan would enable the @entity1 to overcome the issue of flying across the @entity66 and ultimately avenge @entity18 's entry into the war			1
@entity20 completed a 900 - page plan and called the craft the @entity53			2
he believed it would be able to clear the lower reaches of space after being fired with rocket engines			2
anti-american : the @entity24 sought a way to punish the @entity18 for entering @entity76			0
one of the schemes they looked at was a plane which would reach @entity18 via space in order to bomb @entity2 it was expected to reach 13,000 miles per hour , would have a 100 - tonne thrust motor and would reach more than 80 miles above earth			1
' the plan was to wrap the bomb with radioactive sand and have it explode high above @entity2 casting a radioactive cloud over the city , ” aviation historian @entity85 says			0
' it was a kind of prototype dirty bomb			0
' losing control : @entity0 was particularly keen to promote his airforce and saw the plot to bomb @entity2 as an ideal way to win @entity11 's favor ' the standard aircraft of the day could not fly from @entity100 to the @entity18 because they could not carry enough fuel			1
' ' but by reaching sub-orbital altitude the @entity53 ’s fuel life would be extended allowing it to bomb anywhere in the world			0
' ' it was wild science fiction ' ' but @entity20 had worked out all the mathematics			0
he was certain it would work			0
' ' post-war analysis indicated that the space - plane would have burnt up during re-entry but this could have been overcome with thermal shielding			1
' the underlying concept was sound but it was many years ahead of its time			0
' @entity0 finally dismissed the plan and the @entity24 looked at other ways to bomb the @entity18 but never succeeded			2
@entity20 fled to @entity121 and was later sent for by @entity122 who was also interested in the @entity53 concept			0
he was never found by the @entity124 and died in 1964			0
dr @entity125 , an assistant professor in space history at @entity127 said : ' @entity20 was the first to look into the technicalities of building a winged , reusable sub-orbital vehicle			2
' ' his work was extremely far - sighted			0
' failure to launch : the @entity53 , pictured , was devised by @entity21 engineer @entity20 so the @entity24 could bomb @entity2			0
the ambitious space rocket design was n't developed beyond planning stage			0

@entity0 was *tasked* with overcoming long - range bombing *problem*
much of the research would later pave the way for modern space travel
