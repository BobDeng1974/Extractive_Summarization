scroll down to see video ... hijack : @entity1 wanted to seize cruise ships and post footage of passengers being executed online to pressurise governments to release particular prisoners ( file picture ) execution : @entity1 wanted to dress cruise ship passengers up in @entity13 - style orange jumpsuits and then film their murders to post footage online @entity34 may have ordered the slaughter of the 9/11 attacks but he drew the line at a bloodthirsty killing machine dubbed the ' human lawn mower ' , according to papers seized from his compound			1
an idea to fix rotating blades to the front of a pickup truck and drive it into crowds , mowing innocent people down like weeds , attracted widespread enthusiasm among @entity1 supporters on the internet last year			0
but documents seized from the @entity34 compound in @entity55 reveal that the @entity1 leader felt it was a step too far even for the terror group , according to intelligence officials who have read them			1
' he was upset about it , ' a former @entity62 intelligence official told the @entity64			0
' he felt it conflicted with what his vision for what he wanted @entity1 to be			2
' newly released excerpts from the @entity1 papers seized when @entity72 commandos stormed his compound a year ago reveal how @entity34 was struggling to maintain his influence in a terror group whose command structure had been severely weakened by @entity62 drone attacks			1
and , incredibly , the documents suggest the man who ordered two planes to fly into @entity82 ’s @entity81 was concerned that @entity1 ’s public image was being tarnished by the atrocities being carried out in its name in @entity87 and other parts of the @entity89			2
in the months before his death bin @entity34 had backed a @entity98 - born @entity1 ' moderate ' , @entity97 , in drawing up a code of behaviour that would rein in what they regarded as the worst excesses of @entity1 activity			2
although both men remained convinced it was their group ’s duty to kill westerners , including civilians , they felt that murdering fellow @entity105 was ' bad for their public image ' , said @entity1 expert @entity107			2
@entity108 the cache of 141 documents , described as ' pure gold ' by intelligence agencies , also details how the network wanted to conduct a @entity115 - style attack - where ten gunmen killed 164 people in a three - day rampage in 2008 - in @entity119			1
and it reveals the organisation is using a ' twin - track strategy ' - using ' low - cost , low - tech attacks ' to keep security services preoccupied as other ' operatives ' plan large - scale 9/11 type atrocities			1
the documents , seized by @entity131 intelligence operatives in the days following @entity34 's death last year , reveal an ' extraordinarily detailed insight into the inner workings of @entity1 '			2
they also state some of the tactics used by the organisation as it attempts to elude the counter-terrorism initiatives of the world ’s military and intelligence agencies			0
@entity143 reports how @entity1 's hand in the @entity145 and attempted 7/21 bomb plots emerges for the first time with a highly detailed account from cell leader @entity149			1
@entity143 's @entity150 said : ' these documents show that @entity145 was extremely lucky on 7/21			2
' the terrorists were using the same bomb - building instructions as the 7/7 bombers , who had actually encountered the same problem with the way they had mixed their explosives			0
' the 7/7 bombers had closer contacts with @entity149 and were able to contact him and change their bombs so that they worked			0
' the 46 page document outlines how and why the liquid explosive plot took shape and explains how counter-surveillance measures by the 21/7 bombers threw security officers off their scent			2
the files also contain details of the ways in which @entity1 seeks to learn from its mistakes , and the levels of sophistication and determination within its ranks			0
in addition , they reveal the impact that military drone strikes and infiltration by intelligence agencies are having on @entity1 's numbers and behaviour			0
@entity150 added : ' these documents lay open @entity1 ’s inner workings			0
they prove the links between some of its highest profile plots and attacks , and show how it 's trying to cope with the constant pressure from military and intelligence operations against it			0
' the documents were discovered on the memory disc when @entity199 22 - year - old @entity198 was arrested following his return to @entity131 from @entity55			1
buried amongst the files was a pornographic video called @entity203 , and a document marked ' @entity205 '			0
it took @entity131 investigators several weeks to decrypt the file , but when they did they found an inside track on some of the terror group 's most audacious plots and a road map for future operations			1
@entity215 terrorist training manuals in @entity131 , @entity216 and @entity217 were also found in what @entity62 intelligence sources say is the most important haul of terrorist materials in the last year			0
@entity198 and another man called @entity223 , who allegedly travelled back to @entity119 with him , are now on trial in @entity21 where they are pleading not guilty to terror offences			1
@entity223 was detained in @entity227 two weeks after @entity198 's arrest			0
