by @entity0 published : 18:14 est , 3 february 2014 @entity2 : 19:42 est , 3 february 2014 after the heartbreak of @entity4 comes an altogether different challenge for @entity7 ’s rugby players this weekend			1
as well as 15 scotsmen thirsty for @entity11 blood there will be a muddy and maggot - infested @entity13 pitch one expert described as a ‘ national embarrassment ’			1
@entity17 ’s @entity7 team will be looking to bounce back with an emphatic victory , but their efforts could become mired in the @entity13 mud			1
last autumn @entity22 rugby admitted there was a serious problem , and that they were using garlic — the vampire - killers ’ weapon of choice — to combat the worms			2
video : scroll down to watch @entity31 and @entity32 reflect on @entity34 defeat @entity35 ! despite a stirring comeback , @entity7 narrowly lost to @entity34 in their opening @entity38 match in @entity4 @entity40 to trot : @entity7 coach @entity17 needs his team to bounce back when they face @entity42 at @entity43 the culprits — nematodes or , more commonly , roundworms — are not terribly partial to garlic			1
‘ it does n’t kill them , ’ said another expert , ‘ but it does p * * * them off enough to send them deeper into the soil			2
’ in 2014 there really is no excuse for the difficulties @entity7 might encounter if the @entity13 pitch does quickly resemble a 1970s @entity60 mud heap			1
nobody is accusing the @entity22 of foul play but @entity7 ’s @entity63 - winning forward @entity64 believes the poor pitch could be ‘ a leveller ’ , and therefore to @entity42 ’s advantage against a visiting side that would expect to be stronger in the scrum and faster , more powerful and more skilful with the ball in hand			1
will the worm turn ? @entity74 ground staff are working round the clock to get the @entity13 pitch ready for the @entity77 game parasite : the poor pitch can be blamed on the nematode ( @entity80 ) , and an example of damage it can cause to plant roots ( @entity85 ) ‘ if you look at @entity7 ’s front row , @entity87 and @entity88 are very much into the power scrummage , ’ said the former lock			1
‘ they prefer a straight pushing contest to the traditional dark - arts encounter			0
@entity96 minor is a nematode , a type of worm , that has infested the @entity22 turf			0
less than 1mm long , it is a parasite that feeds off the roots of plants , destroying them in the process			0
it was identified in 2007 in the @entity105 , where it damaged potato crops , before making its way to @entity108			0
golf courses have been affected , with yellow - brown patches of grass the tell - tale sign , but now the pests have wormed their way into a stadium			0
‘ but if you ca n’t get traction because the pitch is cutting up , you have a problem			2
the @entity4 pitch is n’t great either and @entity87 suffered against the much shorter @entity121 at the weekend			0
‘ if you think of @entity7 ’s defeats at @entity13 they were often on wet , muddy pitches			1
‘ power runners do n’t have the contact with the ground to break through and the players with skill do n’t have the same confidence underfoot			0
@entity7 wo n’t use it as an excuse but they would prefer a fast , firm track			2
’ it was in september , before @entity42 played @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 on a dreadful surface , that @entity22 rugby first acknowledged there was an issue			1
@entity142 , @entity74 director of management services , spoke of ‘ an excessive build - up of nematodes which have caused significant root damage ’			0
he also warned that the surface ‘ can weaken under the significant pressure exerted by scrums ’			0
root of all evil : one expert has described the @entity13 pitch as a ' national embarrassment ' leveller : the power of @entity7 's front row @entity87 ( r ) and @entity88 could be negated by the poor pitch @entity142 then said experts had been called in , using techniques that included the spraying of garlic , and conceded it could take weeks to sort out			1
by january 13 , however , a @entity74 statement suggested little progress had been made			0
the pitch , it said , ‘ is a matter of understandable concern ’			1
@entity170 club games were moved to another ground so that @entity7 will be the first opponents to play on the pitch this year but yesterday @entity74 admitted to @entity174 that , even now , ‘ the pitch is not in the pristine condition we enjoy normally at @entity13 ’			1
ground staff have been working to improve the situation but the idea that @entity74 has in some way been unfortunate , that this infestation is a freak occurrence , is misleading			1
bright idea ? @entity22 rugby has been using lights to combat the problem , but that could help pests flourish bad start : @entity190 ( r ) and @entity42 were beaten 28 - 6 by @entity191 in their opening @entity38 game most pitches in world sport will have some form of pest problem			1
in recent seasons @entity198 have had to use garlic spray and @entity202 ’s playing surface , widely considered the finest in the @entity203 , is believed to have a nematode problem			1
‘ there are thousands of different types of nematode and some are better than others , ’ said one expert , ‘ but the key is how you treat them and i ’d question some of the advice they might have had up at @entity13			1
‘ they ’ve been using lights on the pitch and that does promote grass growth			0
but , and i have to say i do n’t know what kind of nematode they have , lights can also create a warm , bright environment that enable these pests to flourish			0
‘ there are different solutions but in 2014 you can see that the way forward is to introduce a mix of natural grass with artificial			0
@entity7 did that at @entity232 , as have the @entity233 at the @entity234			2
’ grounds for complaint : @entity198 's @entity237 is one of several @entity203 pitches that have suffered pest problems as part of their recent £ 70million redevelopment of @entity232 , the @entity241 invested in a state - of - the - art @entity244 ‘ hybrid grass ’ pitch that was laid on top of 20 miles of new undersoil heating pipes in august 2012			2
the same surface is also found at the @entity234 and at a number of leading @entity203 football clubs , including @entity202 , @entity253 , @entity198 and @entity254			0
@entity255 have an excellent @entity244 pitch , too , and yet the @entity257 are still undecided as to the best way forward for the @entity259			0
in the meantime , @entity38 rugby suffers because of poor pitches			2
as do the teams who want to play with power and a more expansive style			0
after the defeat in @entity4 , @entity7 have enough on their plates without mud , maggots and garlic !			2

@entity7 meet @entity42 in their second @entity38 game on *saturday*
@entity42 's @entity13 pitch has been infested by parasitic ' nematodes '
one expert has described the surface as ' a national embarrassment '
ground staff have been using garlic to try and curb the problem
@entity286 admit that the pitch is still ' a matter of understandable concern '
