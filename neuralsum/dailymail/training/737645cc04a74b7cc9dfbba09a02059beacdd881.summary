no sale : @entity2 , 51 , pictured with her son @entity3 , 24 , and daughter @entity1 , 13 , was stopped from buying alcohol twice in a week at an @entity6 store @entity6 checkout staff are blocking parents from buying alcohol if they have their children with them			1
although it is legal for anyone over the age of 18 to buy alcohol , over-zealous workers are saying no to parents who take their children shopping with them			1
and rather than apologising , @entity6 bosses have backed their staff , saying it is better that they were ‘ over cautious ’ rather than face prosecution for selling alcohol to under - 18s			1
most supermarkets have introduced a policy on drink sales where staff are expected to challenge anyone who looks under 25 to prove they are over 18			1
they are also able to ban shoppers from buying alcohol if there are ‘ reasonable grounds ’ to believe it might be passed on to someone aged under 18			1
supermarket executives have handed the power to police the system to checkout workers , who have autonomy over who they stop and refuse to serve			0
the issue has been highlighted by 51 - year - old mother - of - three @entity2 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , who was stopped from buying drink along with groceries twice in a week at an @entity6 store			1
in the first case , she was buying a bottle of wine with some food and was with her 24 - year - old university graduate son , @entity3 , who was helping to carry the bags			1
the second time she was with @entity3 and her daughter , @entity1 , aged 13 , who were helping with the shopping , which included some beer and wine for @entity56			1
mrs @entity2 , who works in social care , said she was twice stopped from making a legal purchase			1
the first refusal was because @entity3 had no @entity60 to prove he was over 18 , and the second because @entity1 had no @entity60			1
controversial : @entity6 bosses claim it is better to be ' over cautious ' than to risk prosecution for selling alcohol to under - 18s			1
however mrs @entity2 , right , claims the ages of her children should not affect her right to buy alcohol mrs @entity2 said the ages of her children were irrelevant , but checkout staff told her the heavy - handed tactics were necessary because they can be prosecuted and given an £ 80 on - the - spot fine for selling drink to someone who passes it on to someone under 18			1
she said : ‘ there can be no doubt in anyone ’s mind that i am old enough to buy wine and beer			0
these are legal products , it is not like i was trying to buy a caged wild animal			0
’ she added : ‘ it really should not be so difficult for a working mum to be able to go and buy some drink for @entity56			1
my kids were just there helping to pack the trolley and bags			2
when i am carrying heavy things , i need the help			0
examples of heavy - handed supermarkets stopping adults buying alcohol : sept 2013 : father - of - three @entity100 , aged 50 , was stopped from buying a bottle of whisky by a cashier at @entity104 , in @entity105 , who asked him to prove he was over 18			1
aug 2013 : a mother with a broken hand was left angry and embarrassed after being told she could not buy alcohol in a @entity111 supermarket because her 17 - year - old daughter was helping her pack			2
july 2013 : staff at a @entity115 in @entity116 refused to allow a 43 - year - old woman to buy drink for a barbecue because she was with her 17 - year - old son			2
june 2013 : a 77 - year - old man was stopped from buying a crate of lager from a co-op in @entity125 , @entity126 , because he had his 13 - year - old grandson with him			2
dec 2012 : a seriously ill teenager , aged 18 , was stopped from buying @entity56 gift sets containing alcohol at an @entity6 in @entity131			1
staff stopped the purchase because the 18 - year - old was with her sister , aged 17 , who had lifted the items on to the conveyor belt at the till			2
‘ these policies make going through the till very stressful			0
do parents have to start being devious and telling youngsters to wait by the front door while they put the shopping through the till ? ‘ i am an adult and a mother			2
why does a supermarket or the state feel they can tell me whether or not i can buy products that are legal ? ’ @entity6 defended its policy , saying : ‘ although it may seem a bit heavy - handed , we do n’t blame our colleagues for being over-cautious			2
' if they serve alcohol to anyone under the age of 18 the law says they will be held personally responsible and could be handed an on - the - spot fine			0
' where there is any element of doubt we support our colleagues to make the right decision			0
we are committed to selling alcohol responsibly			0
’ other leading supermarkets , including @entity115 , @entity166 ’s , @entity104 and the co-op , said they also expected checkout staff to demand @entity60 where a shopper appeared to be under 25			0
they said workers can also refuse a sale if they have ‘ reasonable grounds ’ to believe the drink might be passed on to someone under 18			0
the idea of ‘ reasonable grounds ’ is such a grey area that it effectively gives till workers freedom over whether to allow adults to buy drink			0
as a result , there is an increasing number of examples of adults being turned down			0
despite cracking down on parents trying to buy a bottle of wine with their children , supermarkets have been keen to take advantage of more relaxed licensing laws			2
according to @entity197 figures , 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock			0
they make up 13 per cent – or one in every eight – of all bars , shops , hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours			0
police have declared 24 - hour drinking a failed experiment which has led to widespread disorder on @entity208 ’s streets			0
officers have blamed the sale of alcohol by supermarkets for much of the problem .			0
