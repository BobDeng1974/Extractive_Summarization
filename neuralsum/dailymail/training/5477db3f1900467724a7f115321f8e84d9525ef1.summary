by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 17 october 2013 updated : 19:27 est , 17 october 2013 no @entity3 vehicle currently in service could have protected six soldiers who were killed in a fireball in @entity7 , an officer said yesterday			1
sergeant @entity8 , 33 , corporal @entity9 , 20 , and @entity10 , 20 , @entity11 , 20 , @entity12 , 19 , and @entity13 , 21 , all died when a massive roadside bomb ripped apart their warrior armoured vehicle last year			1
the blast flipped the troop carrier over , blew off the gun turret and sent flames 100ft into the air			1
the six men ' unlawfully killed ' in the bomb blast in @entity7			1
they are ( top row left to right ) sergeant @entity8 , corporal @entity9 and private @entity10 , with ( bottom row left to right ) private @entity12 , private @entity11 and private @entity13 but at an inquest into the soldiers ’ deaths yesterday @entity26 , an expert on the warrior , said : ‘ this was a large device and no vehicle that we have is designed to take that			1
’ significant steps had been taken to bolster the warrior fleet since the tragedy , he said			1
but he added : ‘ they [ the insurgents ] can always build a bigger bomb			0
’ the vehicle was on a routine patrol when it was blown up about 25 miles north of the capital of @entity46 , @entity47			1
it was the deadliest single enemy attack on @entity50 forces in @entity7 since 2001			0
fellow soldiers struggled to extinguish the blaze but ‘ nothing could have been done to rescue or save them ’ , said @entity56 coroner @entity55			1
mr @entity55 said : ' this of course is a tragic loss of these six soldiers and these young lives			1
' at least it is very clear from the evidence of the two pathologists and the evidence of those who witnessed the strike that they did not suffer			0
' it also follows that there was nothing that their comrades could have done to rescue or save them			1
' mr @entity55 recorded a narrative verdict			1
outlining the events that day , he said : ' the six soldiers were therefore unlawfully killed whilst on active service			1
' the vehicle was patrolling with another warrior when it was blown up about 25 miles north of the capital of @entity46 , @entity47			1
it was the biggest single loss of life for @entity50 forces in @entity7 since an @entity82 crash killed 14 people in september 2006			2
the inquest at @entity85 heard that no other vehicle of its type was designed to withstand a blast of its type			1
@entity91 , a member of @entity93 the @entity94 , and his comrades , all members of the @entity98 's @entity97 , died of blast injuries caused by the explosion			2
mr @entity55 told the court : ' i am not going to second - guess decisions of commanders in a courtroom today , that is not the purpose of an inquest			2
@entity109 and @entity110 , the father and stepmother of private @entity12 , arrive at @entity113 at a previous hearing ' these are experienced commanders who took decisions on the ground , balancing the risks and exercising judgments			0
' the inquest heard that improvements have been made to @entity122 since the incident including better armour , burst resistant fuel tanks , better ways of getting in and out in emergencies and improved fire detection and protection systems			1
the court was told that eight new fuel tanks have been fitted so far to the vehicles that are being used in @entity7 , with 21 more due to have the upgrade , and the coroner said that ' significant steps ' had been completed in making improvements to the vehicles			1
mr @entity55 said there was no need for a formal report under his powers because he was satisfied the areas of concern had been addressed			0
father - of - two @entity91 , from @entity144 , @entity145 ; @entity146 , from @entity147 , @entity148 , who was about to become a father ; @entity151 , from @entity152 , @entity153 ; @entity154 and @entity155 , both from @entity157 , @entity153 ; and @entity158 , from @entity159 , had all been in @entity7 for only a few weeks when they were killed			2
the court was told it was important to send out the patrol that day , rather than waiting until the next , because of ' force protection ' and showing a visible presence to insurgents			2
when the order was given at 6pm to leave , @entity158 ' stepped up to the mark ' and volunteered to take the place of another soldier on the patrol , who was just returning from the shower , the inquest heard			0
@entity173 , mother of private @entity12 , holds a photograph of her son as she arrives at the inquest the two @entity122 left just after 6.30pm , and soon after , the first warrior detonated the ied , which was triggered by a pressure plate			2
the force of the explosion turned the warrior on to its side and ' flicked off ' its turret , with a fire breaking out almost instantly , which then went on to set off ammunition inside			2
fellow soldiers struggled to extinguish the blaze and get into the stricken warrior , but everyone inside was dead			1
speaking after today 's verdict , families of the soldiers thanked their colleagues for their efforts to save them			1
@entity158 's mother , @entity173 , said : ' this process has been one which a mother never wishes to have to undertake			0
i feel like i have been involved in a nightmare , from which i can never awake , leaving me emotionally drained			0
' from the information we have heard at the inquest , it was a pure quirk of fate that @entity208 should have been kitted up and got into a patrol for which he was not intended			0
@entity173 holds a picture of her son @entity211 who died after taking the place of one of his army colleagues at the last moment ' i am still struggling with this - but how like him to be ready to do his duty for his fellow soldiers			1
how proud i am of his call to duty			0
' @entity158 's father , @entity109 , who attended the inquest with the teenager 's stepmother , @entity226 , said : ' @entity208 always knew what he wanted to do and followed his heart , he did what his grandfather did and became a soldier			0
' we hope there is a lesson to be learned from this inquest that will help and protect all soldiers in the future			2
' @entity151 's mother , @entity239 , spoke of her pride in her son but hit out at politicians , saying : ' to lose your child is as painful as losing your own life			0
our servicemen and women will continue to die as long as politicians who rule our lives value money more than the lives of our sons and daughters			0
' @entity146 's fiancee , @entity254 , who has battled to have the identity of their daughter @entity256 officially recognised , said the inquest had been a difficult process but was an important step in finding out what happened on march 6 last year			0
' it is important to me that @entity256 grows up knowing what happened to her father , ' she said			0
' from the struggle to establish @entity256 's identity and hearing all the evidence it has been an exhausting ordeal and still we have not come to terms with our loss			0
' @entity146 's mother , @entity273 , paid tribute to her son as a ' well - respected young man '			0
@entity155 's mother , @entity276 , said her son loved his @entity3 life and was proud of his service			0
a statement on behalf of @entity154 's family , read by lawyer @entity281 , said : ' obviously nothing can bring @entity283 back but we are grateful that we have answers			0
' we note the verdict the coroner has reached that @entity283 was killed while on active service			1
we feel we can take some comfort from the evidence showing that @entity283 did not suffer			0
' lieutenant colonel @entity291 , chief of staff @entity292 at the time of the incident , said : ' on behalf of the @entity3 and 12 @entity296 , i would like to pay tribute to the six outstanding soldiers who tragically lost their lives in this incident			2
' these men paid the ultimate sacrifice whilst serving their country and delivering a better future for the people of @entity7			2
' their loss is felt keenly across the regiment and the brigade , although this can not compare to the pain felt by their families and friends			2
our thoughts and prayers remain with them today and always			0
