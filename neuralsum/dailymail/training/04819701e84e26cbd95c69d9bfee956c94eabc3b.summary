killed : @entity0 , 26 , was shot dead on monday in @entity1 shocking footage has captured the moment an @entity4 photographer filmed his own death through his lenses			1
the grainy footage shows an @entity4 solider aiming and shooting at @entity0 , before the film goes black			1
the 26 - year - old photojournalist was shot dead on monday as he took photos outside the @entity13 building in @entity1 , where some believe the ousted president @entity15 is being held			1
he was one of at least 51 people killed when security forces opened fire on a large crowd that had camped outside			2
mr @entity20 , a freelance photographer was working for @entity4 's @entity23 newspaper			1
' at around 6am , a man came into the media centre with a camera covered in blood and told us that one of our colleagues had been injured , ' said @entity31 , the culture editor of mr @entity0 ’s newspaper told @entity33			1
' around an hour later , i received news that @entity0 had been shot by a sniper in the forehead while filming or taking pictures on top of the buildings around the incident			1
' he had started filming from the beginning of the prayers so he captured the very beginnings and in the video , you can see tens of victims			2
@entity0 ’s camera will remain a piece of evidence in the violations that have been committed			1
' the military claimed it opened fire because a ‘ terrorist group ’ attacked in an attempt to storm the building			0
terrifying : the grainy footage captures two soldiers on the roof of a building in @entity1 filming : the footage zooms in and out as photographer @entity0 surveys the scene planning : the soldier disappears out of sight behind the yellow stone building horrifying : he then reappears with his gun ready for action before he aims at the photographer moment of death : the grainy footage captures a solider aiming and shooting at @entity0 , before the film goes black but mr @entity15 ’s supporters said the shootings were unprovoked			1
in an emotional news briefing , @entity86 members branded military chief @entity88 an ‘ assassin and a butcher ’			1
but @entity91 , the country ’s top @entity86 cleric , urged @entity4 to ‘ shoulder their responsibility to stop the bloodshed ’ instead of ‘ dragging the country into civil war ’			1
@entity97 , who was at the sit - in , said military troops and police forces opened fire on the protesters during early morning prayers			0
tragic : mr @entity0 was working as a photographer for an @entity4 newspaper ' they opened fire with live ammunition and lobbed tear gas , ' she said by telephone			1
' there was panic and people started running			0
' ' women and children had been among the protesters , she said			0
today @entity4 authorities escalated their crackdown on the @entity86 by ordering the arrest of its spiritual leader , while the group remained steadfast in its defiance of the new military - backed administration and refused offers to join an interim government			1
the prosecutor 's arrest warrant issued for the @entity86 's supreme guide , @entity134 , as well as nine other leading @entity135 will almost certainly stoke anger among the group 's supporters and fellow @entity135			1
the men are suspected of instigating the violence on monday , according to a statement issued by the prosecutor general 's office			2
even as the new prime minister began reaching out to form a @entity146 and restore a measure of stability , the military - backed leadership has come under fierce criticism from those who supported its toppling of president @entity15 last week several groups in the loose coalition participating in the political process have sharply criticized the transitional plan , saying that sidelines them in the transition			0
after a week of violence and mass demonstrations , @entity4 were hoping that the start of the @entity86 holy month of @entity163 on wednesday will significantly calm the turmoil in the streets			1
the sunrise - to - sunset fast cuts down on activity during the day , but the daily protests have been largely nocturnal affairs , and some observers expect the @entity135 camp will likely use it to rally its base			0
still , the warrants highlight the military 's zero - tolerance policy toward the @entity86 and other @entity135 , who continue to hold daily mass protests and sit - ins demanding reinstating @entity15 and rejecting what they describe as a military coup			1
the military already has jailed five of @entity86 leaders , including @entity134 's powerful deputy @entity187 , and shut down their media outlets			1
@entity15 himself remains in custody in an undisclosed location			0
in the face of @entity135 opposition , the military - backed interim president , @entity194 , issued a fast - track timetable on monday for the transition			2
his declaration set out a 7 - month timetable for elections but also a truncated , temporary constitution laying out the division of powers in the meantime			0
the accelerated process was meant , in part , to send reassurances to the @entity207 and other @entity209 allies that the country is on a path toward democratically - based leadership			0
army snipers were caught on camera shooting at a large crowd of @entity4 men this morning the crowd of @entity15 supporters had assembled in the square in the early hours of the morning			1
at least 51 people were killed but it has faced opposition from the very groups that led the four days of mass protests that prompted the military to step in last wednesday			0
the top liberal political grouping , the @entity226 , expressed reservations over the plan late tuesday , saying it was not consulted - ' in violation of previous promises ' - and that the declaration ' lacks significant clauses while others need change or removal			0
' it did not elaborate but said it had presented @entity194 with changes it seeks			0
the secular , revolutionary youth movement @entity239 that organized last week 's protests , also criticized the plan , in part because it gives too much power to @entity194 , including the power to issue laws			2
a post-morsi plan put forward by @entity239 called for a largely ceremonial interim president with most power in the hands of the prime minister			0
at the heart of liberals ' objections is that they wanted to write a new constitution , not amend the one written under @entity15 by an @entity135 - dominated panel			0
that constitution contained several articles that drew fierce criticism from liberal quarters , and helped sparked street protests and violence in 2012			0
other objections centered on superpowers of the interim president			0
however , the only @entity135 party that backed military 's ouster of @entity15 after millions took to the streets on june 30 demanding him to leave , has been vetoing rewriting the constitution			2
meanwhile , new prime minister @entity273 , who was appointed by the interim president on tuesday , is holding consultations on a cabinet that will face the difficult task of guiding the deeply divided country through what promises to be a rocky transition period			0
in what is seen as an attempt at reconciliation , @entity273 has said he will offer the @entity86 , which helped propel @entity15 to the presidency , posts in his transitional government			2
a @entity86 spokesman said the group will not take part in an interim cabinet , and that talk of national reconciliation under the current circumstances is ' irrelevant			2
' he spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his security .			0
