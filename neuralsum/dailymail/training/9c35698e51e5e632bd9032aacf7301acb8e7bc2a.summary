it could , perhaps , be described as a case of ' a bridge too fast '			2
the world 's longest pedestrian suspension bridge - the @entity5 near the city of @entity7 in south - western russia - stretches for almost a kilometre over the @entity11 valley			1
this vast structure can cope with up to 30,000 people at a time			0
bungee - jumpers can opt for 650ft of freefall if they hurl themselves off a viewing platform into the valley below			1
extreme sports fans who have not had enough highs for one day can also speed along a zip wire more than 500ft above the valley floor			2
this is known as the ' @entity34 '			0
lost in the clouds : a burst of mist drifts across the bridge , adding an air of mystery to its lengthy appearance high - wire act : the @entity5 has been recognised as the longest pedestrian suspension bridge on the planet a nice place for a stroll : even if you do n't fancy throwing yourself off the bridge , you can just enjoy the views riders are strapped to a zipwire together , clipped in horizontally side by side			1
the ride reaches speeds of 70mph as it swoops through the air			0
the @entity59 @entity58 has already successfully applied to the @entity60 for the site to be recognised as the longest suspension footbridge in the world			1
quite the feat of construction : the bridge stretches across its wide chasm for the best part of a kilometre spokesman @entity69 says : ' parts of the skypark are still under construction , but we want this to be the highest , fastest , most fun park in the world			1
' he adds : ' there are two heights of bungee in case people do n't feel brave enough to go all the way down from the top			0
do we have to jump ? we 're quite happy up here : a crowd gathers to admire the impressive spectacle long way down : bungee jumpers go into an amazing 650ft of freefall when they take the plunge from the bridge ' but just to come for the bridge , and the views will take your breath away			2
' one visitor , @entity95 , said : ' i was going to go on the high bungee but wimped out			0
' i 'm definitely doing it next time			0
