balanced high above the ground on a cherry picker , powerful hedge - cutter in his outstretched arms and dwarfed by a tree many times his size , this gardener looks like he ’s got his work cut out			0
but it ’s a far from daunting task for @entity12 , head gardener at @entity13 in @entity14 , mid @entity15 , for he and his team gather every year to give this magnificent 300 - year - old , 46ft tall yew tree its yearly trim			1
the job has been made much easier by the introduction of easily - manoeuvrable cherry pickers that have replaced the cumbersome and hard - to - move wooden ladders of old , meaning a job that used to take many months now takes mere weeks			2
and when the team do get a chance to take a break , then the views from on high are certainly worth savouring			0
the centrepiece of the @entity32 tourist attraction is the magnificent castle that was originally built in 1200 as a medieval fortress			0
but it ’s often the magnificent gardens and greenery that draw the most gasps – vast hedges , magnificent borders that grow on a slope - giving the impression that they ’re hanging in the air - and the enormous yew hedges that have grown to such an extent they 've formed a tunnel that visitors can pass through			0
@entity49 for heights : @entity12 , head gardener at @entity13 in @entity14 , mid @entity15 , at work on the yearly task of trimming the enormous yew trees bit of a trim : the work used to take many months to complete , with people having to scale heavy wooden ladders			1
now modern cherry pickers , above , are used beautiful scene : the @entity32 property in @entity63 near the @entity15 / @entity65 border features extensive gardens , terraces and parkland what a yew ! a glimpse over the top of the tree offers views of carefully - tended lawns , well - kept borders and animals wandering in the castle 's fields @entity13 , above , was originally built as a fortress in 1200 and was home to a succession of @entity15 princes @entity84 green : two gardeners put the finishing touches to an area of the yew that they 've worked on all morning the task takes weeks to complete but appearances must be maintained for the thousands of tourists and gardening enthusiasts who visit each year vertical challenge : some of the impressive shrubbery and gardens in the grounds are planted on steep slopes lift - off : the new cherry pickers help the workers to reach hard - to - get - at areas of the tree that were sometimes missed in the past tree way : the gigantic yew hedges have been around for 300 years and have grown to such an extent that a tunnel has been formed that visitors can walk through the gardeners use ear - defenders to combat the noise of their hedge - cutters as they trim the foliage in the grounds of the @entity32 property @entity115 : elements of the trees have fused together over hundreds of years to form one enormous green growth @entity120 influence : the gardens have been designed according to @entity123 and @entity124 styles neat and tidy : a great deal of work was carried out in the early twentieth century to restore the gardens after they had endured a period of neglect @entity132 , the wife of the fourth @entity133 , who was responsible for restoring the gardens , said they had the potential to be ‘ the most beautiful in @entity65 and @entity15 ’ this job 's growing on me : the gardeners have become pruning experts thanks to their many hours spent tending the trees			1

gardeners have to use cherry pickers to reach the top of the trees
yews have grown so big that visitors can walk a path within them
