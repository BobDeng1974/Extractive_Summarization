a young mother - of - two has refused @entity2 cancer treatment and is trying to cure herself with herbal remedies and a raw food diet instead			1
@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was diagnosed with breast cancer just five months ago after finding a lump in her chest			1
the 34 - year - old was devastated when doctors told her she needed emergency surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy to give her the best chance of survival			1
but to the horror of her doctors - and initially her family - she has defiantly refused all medical treatment , opting to eat raw vegetables and take vitamin supplements in a bid to prolong her life			1
@entity5 , 34 , was diagnosed with breast cancer but has refused medical treatment , as she says chemotherapy would leave her unable to care for children @entity31 , 14 , and @entity32 , 4 ms @entity5 was told she needed surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
but she refused these treatments , opting to eat a diet of raw vegetables - with no fish or meat - and take vitamins and herbal remedies instead ms @entity5 said she has always been against invasive medical treatments , and believes doctors are ' biased ' towards them			1
she is pictured , left , before she became ill and , right , after her diagnosis ms @entity5 said : ' i do n't want to lose my breast and be pumped full of chemotherapy			1
' people have called me selfish because i 'm refusing all treatment provided on the @entity2 but if anything , having the treatment is selfish			2
' i would n't be able to do anything with my eldest son , @entity31 , who is 14 , and my youngest son , @entity32 , who is just four , if i was being sick and feeling tired all the time			0
' thanks to my new eating and exercising regime , i now feel healthier than ever			0
' being diagnosed with breast cancer at such a young age is heartbreaking but i was more petrified of chemotherapy than i was about the cancer			1
' i felt doctors were biased towards conventional treatment			2
' ms @entity5 has always been against chemotherapy and invasive treatments that aim to cure cancer			1
ms @entity5 takes around 20 vitamins a day as well as herbal remedies , which she claims shore up her immune system			1
she also exercises as often as she can professor @entity71 , medical oncologist and chief clinician at @entity73 , warned if left untreated , ms @entity5 ’s cancer is likely to spread around her body			1
he told @entity75 : ‘ i completely understand that someone who has just been told they have cancer might be scared and worried - and might seek alternative treatments			1
‘ but this is a very risky strategy			0
‘ @entity73 spends millions carrying out clinical trials to ensure the advice doctors give to patients about cancer is evidence - based			1
‘ there simply is n’t any reliable evidence for alternative approaches			2
‘ sometimes we see spontaneous remissions , which are put down to alternative therapies , but no clinical trial has ever showed them to be effective			0
' he added : ‘ if i was getting on an aeroplane to travel across the @entity95 , i would want to get on the plane with someone who was trained , knew what they were doing , and had looked at the evidence			0
' not with someone without a licence who vaguely thought there was a chance they could fly a plane			0
' there is simply no evidence diet changes and vitamins can treat cancer			1
‘ one of the reasons breast cancer deaths have come down in recent years is because we have effective treatments in the form of surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
‘ if people do n’t take those treatments they have to realise they are putting their lives at risk			0
‘ breast cancer spreads into the breasts , into the chest wall , into the lymph nodes and into the blood stream and around the body			0
‘ it ’s likely if this lady is n’t treated her cancer will spread around her body			0
that ’s what usually happens			0
‘ she has a high chance of cure with chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
it would be a real shame for her to miss out on this			0
’ she said : ' one of my friends had cancer but he died while having chemo as his immune system became so low			0
' also , the thought of losing my hair terrified me as well , i did n't want to look like a cancer sufferer			0
' doctors told me i needed to lose my whole right breast and that chemo would stop it from spreading			2
' i decided to research alternative treatments online and that 's when i found out about the different herbal remedies you can take to help your body			1
' i no longer eat meat or fish and live off a 90 per cent raw vegetable diet so i eat a lot of vegetables and fruit juices			1
' however , experts warn there is no evidence alternative therapies can cure cancer , stop its spread or slow tumour growth			1
@entity172 , senior information development nurse at @entity173 , said : ' using herbal remedies instead of traditional cancer treatment is considered a form of alternative therapy			1
' alternative therapies are used instead of conventional cancer treatments			2
they are different from complementary therapies			0
' no alternative therapies have ever been proven to cure cancer or slow its growth and @entity173 does not advocate the use of them			2
' for anyone considering , or currently having , alternative therapy it is important to tell your doctor as soon as possible			0
' but ms @entity5 believes chemotherapy would ruin her quality of life , and alternative therapies will allow her to live longer			1
she said : ' i do n't allow cancer to rule my day to day life but i like to see if my self - healing is working to halt the growth of my lump			2
' i work 50 - hours a week , i support two young children and i exercise as often as i can			0
' she monitors the size of the lump on her breast by drawing two black dots onto it every day			0
her family were devastated when she told them she was going to refuse all treatment , but she said : ' my mum was really upset but once i showed her my research and what i hoped to do , she understood and accepted my decision			2
' my breast cancer is ductal carcinoma and doctors think it 's linked to an infection i caught during breastfeeding in my milk duct which caused the mutation of cells to grow			0
' ms @entity5 has an ultrasound on her breast every three months but does n't plan to accept treatment even if her cancer starts to grow rapidly			1
ms @entity5 , pictured with her youngest son @entity32 , four , before she was diagnosed , says she will carry on treating herself with alternative therapies even if scans show her cancer tumour has grown she said : ' on my last check - up in january they told me that my lump at grown 0.9mm , which is such a tiny amount considering how long i have had the tumour for			1
' i have asked for an mri but my doctor knows that even if my cancer had spread that i would n't want chemotherapy so there 's no point in finding out			2
' she says feels that she 's taking her life into her own hands and wants others to do the same			0
she added : ' i feel better than i ever have , people always say i look great considering i have cancer but it 's because i have n't been pumped with drugs			0
' i take about 20 different vitamins to help keep up my immune system			0
' i 'm not looking for a miracle cure but i feel i can keep my life as normal by following my own detoxing treatment plan			0
' i have n't asked doctors how long i will live without treatment but i 'm confident it will be longer than if i had conventional treatment			0
ms @entity5 has even set up a blog to document her journey and is writing an ebook in a bid to provide others with diet tips and herbal remedies that combat cancer			1
she said : ' i know not everyone will agree with my choice of self - healing but there are lots of people who do and it 's amazing how much support i have had from complete strangers			0
' i hope my story gives others the strength to make their own cancer treatment decisions based on what they want rather than what doctors feel is best			2
