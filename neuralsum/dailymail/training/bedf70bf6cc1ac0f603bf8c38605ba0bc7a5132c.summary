from the @entity1 to the @entity2 , there 's no shortage of mythical creatures rumoured to walk the @entity6 - and no shortage of people convinced they truly do exist			1
but few legendary beast aficionados are as committed as those dedicated to @entity11 , with legions of hunters from @entity14 to @entity15 dedicated to tracking down @entity16			1
among them are @entity18 , a hunter from @entity20 , and @entity22 entrepreneur @entity21 - both of whom say they are the man to uncover the truth about the mythical monster			1
the a-team : @entity22 bigfoot expert @entity29 with his crack team of @entity16 hunters found it ? @entity18 has claimed to have tracked @entity11 down not once but twice now a new @entity34 documentary , @entity11 , has delved into their often bizarre world where conspiracy theorists and unscheduled falls in the river are all part of the job			1
but while the men are convinced , not everyone agrees , among them the mother of @entity18 's daughter @entity44			1
and the fact she 's not convinced is partly down to @entity18 himself , who in 2008 claimed to have found @entity11 but was soon revealed to have found nothing more than a @entity16 costume that he had filled with possum roadkill			1
' i hurt a lot of people in 2008 with the hoax , ' he admits , ' a lot of true believers , and i 'd like to redeem myself and show that i 'm the real deal			1
' in a bid to prove it , he 's travelled to @entity14 where reports from @entity60 say that a homeless person encountered the beast while sleeping rough in the woods			0
' some homeless people called it in and three motorists called it in , and then i came up here and across this path , i saw it , ' says @entity18			2
' i 'm not going to tell you how tall it is because i do n't know but it was a hairy upright creature and when i saw it , my heart dropped			0
' i am 100 per cent in no doubt that there is a @entity11 and that there is a @entity11 right here			2
' but while @entity18 is dedicated to the pursuit of @entity16 , his six years in the game make him a novice compared to @entity29 , who has spent 37 years hunting @entity11			1
' i 've seen the creature with my own eyes , ' he reveals			0
' i was 12ft away from one once and i freaked out			0
' i made a dedication to myself that day that i 'm going to bring one of these things back because i know they exist			0
37 years later , i 'm still doing it			1
' hoax : @entity18 's 2008 ' discovery ' turned out to be a @entity16 costume filled with dead possums the real deal ? a computer generated image showing what the primate - like @entity11 might actually look like famous : a still from the 1972 @entity101 film purporting to show @entity11 quite what mrs @entity102 makes of it all is anyone 's guess , although his son @entity107 has been known to team up with his father and his crack ' a-team ' of @entity11 hunters			1
travelling with @entity107 and @entity21 is @entity112 , described by @entity113 as his ' chief tracker and sharpshooter ' and @entity116 , an elderly survival specialist			2
when @entity113 is n't out hunting for @entity11 , he 's busy making documentaries ; among them @entity119 , @entity11 lives 2 and @entity120			2
it might sound bizarre but @entity29 is convinced he knows what he 's doing			0
' you hear about people saying they 're a @entity11 hunter , @entity11 researcher , @entity11 this and that , crypto zoologist , ' he complains			2
' crypto my ass - the name of the game is this : you either heel and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or you 'll never find anything			0
' while @entity18 might call himself a @entity11 hunter , he says that he too is the real deal			1
' @entity141 has sent me something to say " look , there is a @entity11 , be committed now			2
" rather menacingly , he continues : ' unfortunately for the @entity11 , i 'm going to have to kill it			0
if there is someone out here in a costume , they will be dead soon because i 'm going to kill them			0
' so does @entity11 really exist ? @entity29 is convinced that the primate prints he finds come from a juvenile sasquatch while @entity18 goes public with claims that yet again , he has managed to shoot and kill @entity11 - and has the corpse to prove it			1
' growing up i thought i 'd be a cowboy , ' adds @entity18 , ' but i gave it up for the same reason that you do n't pursue a lot of your little pipe dreams			0
' this is not a pipe dream - a pipe dream is something you ca n't achieve			0
' @entity164 : shooting @entity11 , tonight at 10pm on @entity165			0
