' there 's no cafetiere and there 's no corkscrew ! ' listening to my husband @entity4 's rant minutes into our family @entity9 adventure i was reminded that i 'm not married to @entity10			1
but his gripes were soon drowned out by the whoops of delight from our two young boys as they bounced on the beds … ' bunk beds ! in a tent ! ' - their tiny heads about to explode in excitement			1
a full - blown corkscrew crisis was quickly averted as we befriended our better - equipped neighbours and , once the wine was flowing , we were able to take in our surroundings			1
@entity25 and @entity26 for their cave adventure it 's not advertised as ' glamping ' but with big duvets and brass beds , @entity9 's @entity30 tents are more luxurious than an average stay under canvas			1
everything is in situ , so no worrying about whether you 've forgotten your tent pegs or frying pan … you just bring yourselves , clothes and food ( and in our case , a lot of local wine )			0
we visited @entity48 site in the stunning @entity50 region in south central @entity51 at the end of august			1
about an hour - and - half 's drive from the beaches of the south and @entity59 airport , it 's known as the gastronomic centre of @entity51			1
@entity61 is a quiet , well - established , family friendly site nestled on the banks of the picturesque @entity50 river			1
for us , entertaining our boys @entity25 , six , and @entity26 , four , is the number one priority on holiday - that and escaping the chaos that is our life in @entity70			1
this site is a five - star park - at the top end of what 's on offer in @entity51			1
with four pools and a camp ' animateur ' organising activities for little ones , it did n't disappoint			1
the big hit for our boys was the pool complex - it included a waterfall and ' rapids ' section that kept them amused for hours			1
the other attraction was other children 's toys , and we spent a great deal of our time returning them to our neighbours ' tents to preserve community relations and other parents ' sanity			1
the campsite has immaculate facilities			0
there are plentiful and clean showers , family washing areas , waist - high baby baths and even a dog shower area			2
most important of all , the site felt safe and relaxed			2
most parents let their children scoot and cycle around on their own and the little ones loved the freedom			0
the region is famous for having the world 's oldest cave paintings at @entity115 - @entity114 for me , getting away from work does n't mean switching off from the news entirely , and with wi - fi availa - ble across the site and daily @entity121 papers , i kept up to date from the comfort of my sunlounger			1
@entity124 and her boys were excited when they discovered their tent came with bunk beds the @entity129 tents are well equipped ( although cafetieres are no longer provided ) , with adequate cooking facilities , gas barbecues and fridge freezers			2
fans and heaters are also provided - which proved useful one chilly evening			2
there were some jokers on site who referred to our area as the @entity144 enclave , due to the beige ' refugee camp ' appearance of our tents			1
the brown canvas combined with overhanging trees means they are a little gloomy inside			2
we were also closer to our neighbours than we would have liked ( less than 6ft to one side ) , useful for corkscrews … less so for privacy			0
that said , we did n't spend that much time in the tent as there is so much to do			0
kayaking on the @entity50 is the number one tourist attraction ( lower age limit seven )			1
the 20 - mile gorge that winds through limestone cliffs is a national nature reserve			2
my husband and i took turns to brave the rapids that lead you under the awe - inspiring @entity172 - a natural arch more than 180ft high			2
this region is also famous for the world 's oldest cave paintings at @entity176 and there are hundreds of underground grottos			1
our boys were captivated by the prospect of caving			0
reared on a diet of @entity184 , they were concerned about ' smugglers ' … but once their hard hats were on they were up for it			0
we visited @entity188 , which is one of the smaller caves in the region but no less spectacular than the big attractions			2
the nearby village of @entity194 was also a big hit			0
clinging to the edge of the gorge , troglodyte dwellings are still in use today and narrow staircases spiral through maze - like alleyways			2
with four pools and a camp ' animateur ' organising activities for little ones , the park did n't disappoint the campsite has immaculate facilities and feels safe and relaxed so it 's perfect for families at the end of a long day 's sightseeing a surprisingly good restaurant on site made life easy on the days we did n't fancy cooking			1
the evening entertainment was also a bonus			0
we met many families at @entity48 who had returned from previous years			1
for us , duvets and brass beds did n't make up for the fact that we were just a layer of canvas away from another frazzled family , but this was a holiday for the kids			2
they had a blast and collapsed into their bunks exhausted every night			0
we managed to get a bit of down time which , as anyone with a four - and six - year - old will tell you , is the best you can hope for			2
just do n't forget your corkscrew ! @entity239 presents @entity240 from 9am to noon on weekdays , and @entity241 at 8.30pm on fridays			0
