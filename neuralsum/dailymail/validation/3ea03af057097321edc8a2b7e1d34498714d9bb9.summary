' the case of the @entity16 also involved levitation , furniture being moved through the air , and flying objects swirling towards witnesses			1
there were cold breezes , physical assaults , graffiti , water appearing on the floor , and even claims of matches spontaneously bursting into flame			2

the only way it could communicate was through me and my sister			0
' it was an extraordinary case			0
it 's one of the most recognised cases of paranormal activity in the world			0

' i think it really left its mark , the activities , the newspaper attention , the different people in and out of the house			0
it was n't a normal childhood			0
' most of the activity centred on 11 - year - old @entity11 , who was apparently seen floating across the room the disturbing events which included moving furniture unfolded for more than a year behind the door of the ordinary - looking semi-detached council house on a suburban street some of the events were captured on camera , and the images are disturbing			1
