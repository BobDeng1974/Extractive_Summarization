by @entity0 published : 07:24 est , 12 april 2012 updated : 01:35 est , 13 april 2012 whoops : @entity3 president @entity2 said he went to @entity4 but journalists with him in @entity6 deny it @entity2 is facing ridicule after falsely claiming he visited @entity6 ’s devastated @entity4 nuclear plant			1
he told a presidential election rally that he went to the plant crippled by last year ’s earthquake and tsunami			1
but although he was the first @entity14 leader to visit @entity6 after the tragedy , mr @entity2 never left @entity16			1
he told 5,000 supporters in @entity18 : ‘ i went to @entity4 … and unlike @entity19 , i can tell you the disaster was caused by the 42metre wave from a tsunami			1
' frankly , i do n’t see the immediate risk of a tsunami in @entity27			2
’ mr @entity2 was speaking in defence of nuclear power , which his socialist challenger mr @entity19 has vowed to scale back			2
the gaffe has been seized upon by his rivals			2
mr @entity19 , who is leading mr @entity2 in the polls for this month ’s election , said : ‘ this is the first time in the history of the @entity3 republic that a candidate has told of a voyage he never made			1
’ two years ago mr @entity2 claimed he was in @entity40 in 1989 on the day the wall came down , bragging on @entity42 that he decided to leave @entity43 for @entity40 on the morning of november 9 , 1989 , because he wanted ‘ to take part in the event which was looming ’			0
claim : this picture of @entity2 shows the now @entity3 president taking a axe to the @entity49 in 1989 , but it was not when he claimed it was disaster : the stricken @entity4 plant was hit by a huge earthquake in march last year he claimed he arrived in @entity40 the same day and then crossed @entity56 to the @entity57			1
he wrote on @entity42 : ‘ the night continued amid general enthusiasm			0
the reunion of the @entity61 people signalled the end of the @entity63 and the start of a period of great liberty in @entity67			0
’ but , somewhat inconveniently , official records placed the then 34 - year - old mayor of the @entity43 suburb of @entity71 in @entity3 attending a service commemorating the death of @entity74 on that day			1
as a result , he was mercilessly mocked by the media			0
yesterday one socialist spokesman quipped on @entity78 : ‘ @entity2 is everywhere , on the @entity49 and at @entity4			0
now it ’s the anniversary of the @entity80 … was he on board ? mr @entity2 has form when it comes to this			0
’ the presidential @entity85 said yesterday that it had no comment to make on mr @entity2 ’s claims that he visited @entity4			0
@entity88 : east @entity61 climb the wall as it is taken down on november 9 , 1989 , but @entity2 's claims that he was there that night were found to be false			0

he made the claim at a rally in @entity18 but journalists on his @entity6 trip last year say he never left @entity16
@entity3 president is *branded* a liar and election rivals ask if he was also on the @entity101
