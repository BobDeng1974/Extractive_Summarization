it 's probably totally to do with my age i 'm sure , but i do n't think of the @entity3 as that old			1

@entity12 and @entity13 on tour			0
i could be describing last weekend , let alone something that is in fact four decades old			0
but i am happy to commit that era to the past if it means @entity21 's new documentary ' @entity20 : @entity22 ' can be seen as a truly historical document			1
@entity20 's first black footballer @entity24 has been the subject of documentary @entity20 : @entity22 talented @entity20 winger @entity26 was racially abused by his own supporters during the @entity3 @entity28 was targeted by racists after signing for @entity20 in 1981 before making his debut a year later @entity32 : @entity33 , march 4 , 1962 ( age 52 ) 1981 - 1986 : @entity20 ( 79 lg apps , 11 gls ) 1986 - 1987 : @entity37 ( 16 , 4 ) 1988 - 1989 : @entity38 ( 9 , 2 ) 1990 - 1991 : @entity39 ( 17 , 3 ) because it told the incredible story of @entity24 , the talented young winger who in 1982 became @entity20 's first black player			1
and in doing so , also told of the torrid time he had in that pioneering role ; one which , as we go on to discover , was in fact crucial in the development of both the club and its supporters			2
yet this is not all			0
because although this was clearly a massive part of @entity24 's life and career , it paled in comparison to some of the other adversities that he has faced			1
adversities that , as a viewer and a human being , you ultimately are delighted this incredible individual has gone on to overcome			0
in ' @entity20 : @entity22 ' , @entity67 proved himself more than eloquently capable of recalling how it was for him from the time he signed professional forms from his local club @entity73 in 1981			2
he talked vividly and emotionally , for example , about warming up as a sub for his debut at @entity78 the next year , and thinking ' are they for real ? ' as he heard a torrent of racial abuse			0
then on turning and telling them to ' say that to my face ' , he discovered ' it was my own fans '			2
' all i wanted to do was get off the pitch , ' he added , and this was only the beginning of how life was going to be as a pioneer at the club			0
a time that ended when ' one of their favourites called me a racist name			2
i did n't take it too well			0
and i was edged out			0
' @entity28 pictured during a @entity20 match in 2008 as the former players got together at the training ground @entity28 makes a prize draw during a @entity104 match between @entity20 and @entity105 in 2009 this ' favourite ' , although discussed , is never named in the documentary			1
in between @entity24 's heartfelt confessions are testimonials from other men who 'd had a vested interest in @entity28 's career			1
and they all gave a vivid context to the times in which @entity28 was making his way in the game			2
@entity120 @entity119 is a lifelong @entity20 fan and recalled walking down the @entity121 at this time with ' the @entity122 trying to recruit			1
imagine how that felt being a little black kid '			0
@entity125 , who was also a regular at @entity126 during these times , recalled ' @entity20 fans fighting each other '			2
while @entity130 , a team - mate of @entity28 's , had seen and heard this hardcore of ' not fans ... users of @entity20 ' , and chose to use a post match press conference to take a stand against the abuse			1
ultimately though , @entity136 was able to talk in the documentary about ' the luxury ' of just being able to be a footballer because of what @entity28 had gone through			1
while he also pointed out that @entity24 should be ' acknowledged a lot more for shutting down and changing the way people see @entity20			1
' @entity20 's @entity28 ( right ) gets away from @entity145 's @entity144 in a @entity147 derby match in the @entity3 @entity28 scores for @entity20 in december 1983 after making his debut two years earlier for the club @entity28 was approached by a fan , he reveals in the documentary , that regretted the way he treated him yet for @entity28 during the @entity3 , kudos was the least of his priorities			1
because it was the beginning of a period in his life that saw him disappear from the game prematurely through injury , go broke , turn to drugs , get clean , twice be diagnosed and beat cancer , and lose a son at just nine days old who ' died in my arms '			1
yet in spite of , or more likely because of all of this , we discover at the end of ' @entity20 : @entity22 ' that he is now working in the community for his old club , mentoring and advising kids in school			2
not only that , he is also going back to see his old team			0
where one night , he told us , a fan approached him because he needed to apologise to @entity28 for having been one of those racist abusers			1
with a tear in his eye , the former winger told us of how the fan said : ' i was ignorant			1
i was following my dad			0
i did n't know better			0
i realise now ... and i tell my kids about racism			0
' @entity24 said : ' i got to respect that			2
' it is a life - affirming story , and one that not only hopefully confirms that those tales from the @entity3 are fundamentally a thing of the past , but also that @entity24 himself has a future that is well worth looking forward to .			1
