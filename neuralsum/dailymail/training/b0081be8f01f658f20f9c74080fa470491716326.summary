by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 10:29 est , 24 december 2013 @entity3 : 10:41 est , 24 december 2013 a natural cave discovered near the source of the @entity7 tsunami contains the footprints of past gigantic waves dating up to 7,500 years ago			1
experts say that the @entity12 cave , which is close to where the earthquake hit , could help them predict when the next tsunami is likely to occur			1
and according to the research , the next disaster could be centuries , if not decades away			2
the findings provide the longest and most detailed timeline for tsunamis that have taken place off the far western tip of @entity25 island in @entity27 province			1
a guide stands inside a cave which scientists said reveals history of ancient tsunamis the province is where 100 foot waves triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake on december 26 , 2004 , killing 230,000 people in several countries			1
the limestone cave , located within a couple hundred yards of the coast near @entity27 , is about three feet above knee - high tide and protected from storms and wind			2
only huge waves that inundate the coastal area are able to gush inside			0
in 2011 researchers uncovered seabed sand deposits that were swept into the cave over thousands of years and neatly layered between bat droppings like a geological cake			1
the cave was discovered near the source of 2004 's massive earthquake - spawned tsunami the @entity12 cave contains the footprints of past gigantic waves dating up to 7,500 years ago radiocarbon analysis of materials , including clamshells and the remains of microscopic organisms , provided evidence of 11 tsunamis before 2004			1
the disasters were by no means evenly spaced , said lead researcher @entity66 from the @entity67 of @entity68			0
the last one occurred about 2,800 years ago , but there were four others in the 500 years before that			2
and it is possible there were others			0
researchers know , for instance , that there were two mammoth earthquakes in the region around 1393 and 1450			0
the cave provides a rare natural record suggesting future generations living in the coastal area must stay prepared because disasters can occur in relatively short bursts or after long lulls mr @entity66 said a big tsunami could have carried away evidence of other events through erosion			1
the scientists are still working to determine the size of the waves that entered the cave			0
mr @entity66 said : ' the take - home message is perhaps that the 2004 event does n't mean it wo n't happen for another 500 years			2
' we did see them clustered together closer in time			0
i would n't put out a warning that we 're going to have an earthquake , but it shows that the timing is really variable			0
' the quake that triggered the 2004 tsunami surprised scientists because the fault that unleashed the megathrust temblor had been quiet for hundreds of years			1
and since the last big earthquake had struck more than 500 years earlier , there was no surviving oral history that could have helped people understand the risk			0
since 2004 , much research has been done to try to learn about the area 's past by examining sand deposits , uplifted coral and gps data			1
@entity120 , a geosciences professor at @entity121 in @entity122 has been following the research			0
she said : ' the findings are very significant			2
' the sand sheets in the cave cover a very long time span and give an excellent idea about earthquake frequency			0

natural discovery provides record of past tsunamis dating 7,500 years
the cave could also help to predict when next disaster will occur
' significant ' findings made near the site of 2004 's @entity7 tsunami
