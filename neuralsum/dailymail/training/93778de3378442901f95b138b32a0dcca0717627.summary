by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 01:32 est , 7 august 2013 the lack of stigma attached to divorce and the financial independence of women has fuelled a rise in separations among the over- 60s			2
the growing number of ‘ silver separators ’ is in stark contrast to the falling divorce rates among younger couples			2
official figures show there were 9,439 divorces where the husband was over 60 in 2011 , up 73 per cent in two decades			1
among women over 60 , the increase was 81 per cent			1
silver splitters : new figures show how the number of divorces involving men aged over- 60 has soared , while the overall number of divorces has fallen trend : despite @entity29 's rising population , the overall divorce rate has fallen but is on the up among over- 60s the @entity31 , which compiled the report , said older couples no longer feel the pressure from friends and family to stay together			1
it added : ‘ as it becomes more common to be divorced , there are fewer stigmas attached			2
’ although the figures are largely driven by men divorcing their wives , the report says the financial security of working women has added to the increase			2
‘ women have become more financially independent and are more likely to have built up their own pensions , ’ it said			2
‘ therefore in general women are now more able to support themselves outside of marriage than in the past			0
’ nevertheless , the report said , women tend to have lower pensions than men and this may be a reason why wives are less likely to be the marriage partner who files for divorce among couples over 60			1
however women are more likely to ask for a divorce among younger couples			1
among married men over 60 , 2.3 in every 1,000 got divorced in 2011 compared to only 1.6 in every 1,000 in 1991			1
the rising trend among older people went in the opposite direction to divorce rates for couples of all ages			1
laughing matter : the phenomenon of pensioners splitting up is now so widespread it was the basis of @entity78 's comedy drama @entity79 , starring @entity80 these showed the 13.6 divorces for every 1,000 married men in 1991 dropped to 10.8 for every 1,000 in 2011			1
one reason for the increase in the over- 60s splitting up is that there are now many more older people than in past decades			0
the average time a marriage has lasted when a husband over 60 is divorced is 27.4 years , the @entity31 said			1
the average length of a marriage that ends in divorce for couples of all ages is 11.5 years			0
blame : actress @entity95 has attacked women who get divorced later in life , saying they are to blame for pushing up house prices divorce lawyers suggested that older couples from the ‘ baby boom ’ generation are coming to share the attitudes of a generation among which many people prefer informal cohabitation to marriage			1
better health is also encouraging older people to behave in the same way as those in their thirties and forties , they added			0
@entity115 of @entity116 said : ‘ retirement can be a real crunch point for couples			0
‘ one spouse often carries on their life as they have done for many years whilst the other retires , not only professionally but socially as well			0
it is a realisation that they have different interests			0
‘ i had one client who basically reached a point where he decided he just could n’t put up with the marriage any more and wanted to enjoy his old age			0
‘ he actually commented to me during the divorce proceedings that he “ wanted to die in peace ”			0
‘ we have recently had a client in his 80s who left his wife of 60 years for his “ fancy woman ” , aged 62			0
he felt life was just too short			0
’ @entity142 of @entity143 said : ‘ those currently over the age of 60 are the last generation for whom marriage would have represented the norm			0
‘ it may come as a surprise to find that older men are responsible for breaking up a marriage			0
‘ however , while it used to be thought that men would have a limited life expectancy beyond retirement , they now live longer			1
‘ the combination of a longer life and the means to enjoy it makes the prospect of husbands starting a new life in their later years more likely			1
’ @entity166 served : most men who divorce after turning 60 have been married for up to 40 years equality : as couples get older , men are more likely to file divorce			2

9,439 divorces where the husband was over 60 in 2011 , up 73 *%* since 1991
among women over 60 it has risen by 81 per cent in two decades
@entity31 says couples no longer feel social pressure to stay together
rising life expectancy also means fewer marriages end in death
lawyers warn the grass is not always *greener* and new partners struggle
