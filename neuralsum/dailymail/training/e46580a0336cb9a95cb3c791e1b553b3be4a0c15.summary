climate change could increase the number and severity of global conflicts , according to a report from former @entity6 military generals			1
this is because it might make certain regions uninhabitable , and it will also open up more trade and military routes between countries			0
in a report published this year they explain how a warming climate may have implications for national security , and they believe action needs to be taken			0
a report by former @entity6 military officials says the @entity6 should prepare for security issues from climate change ( stock image shown )			1
environmental changes could increase the chances of threats			0
poverty , population migration and more could raise the chances of conflict , in the report , titled @entity38 and the @entity39 , the @entity32 - a group of retired officers from the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 - said there could be upcoming threats associated with climate change , reports @entity44			1
they expressed surprise that climate change remains such a polarising issue , despite being widely accepted as a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later			0
earlier this week president @entity50 struck a landmark deal with @entity52 that would see both countries significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over the next three decades			2
under the agreement , @entity6 pledged to cut between 26 and 28 per cent of the level of its carbon emissions set in 2005 by 2025 as part of the global fight against climate change			1
@entity52 president @entity62 also said he would aim to cap his country 's emissions by 2030			0
in order to successfully accomplish this , he said 20 percent of @entity52 's energy needs will come from alternative sources , such as solar power and wind energy , by that year			0
‘ we are dismayed that discussions of climate change have become so polarising and have receded from the arena of informed public discourse and debate , ' says the report			2
they continue : ‘ the potential security ramifications of global climate change should be serving as catalysts for cooperation and change			2
’ ‘ instead , climate change impacts are already accelerating instability in vulnerable areas of the world and are serving as catalysts for conflict			2
’ they say that actions taken by the @entity6 and the international community have been insufficient to deal with the projected effects by climate change			2
these , they say , could increase things such as poverty , environmental degradation , political instability and social tensions - ‘ conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence			1
’ the report also says melting @entity107 ice ( stock image shown ) could open new military and trade routes			1
it could lead to ' conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence ' the report says that actions taken by the @entity6 and the international community have been insufficient to deal with climate change			1
extreme weather is already causing prolonged droughts and flooding , resulting in food shortages and population migration ( stock image shown of immigrants fleeing unrest in @entity125 in 2011 ) they explain how in areas such as @entity130 , @entity131 and the @entity132 , the impacts of climate change are already being seen			1
extreme weather is causing prolonged droughts and flooding , resulting in food shortages and population migration			0
and in particular they say the projected impacts of climate change ‘ could be detrimental to military readiness , strain base resilience both at home and abroad , and may limit our ability to respond to future demands			0
’ the report recommends that the @entity6 should take a global leadership role in preparing for climate change			1
and they should also prepare for the potential to carry out increased military operations in the @entity107 as ice begins to melt			0
this may open new routes between countries - such as @entity154 and @entity155 - that may change how military can be deployed .			0

report says @entity6 should prepare for security issues from climate change
environmental changes could increase the chances of threats
poverty , population migration and more could raise chance of conflict

could lead to ' conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence ' says the report
*advises* @entity6 to become global leader in preparing for climate change
