by @entity0 published : 13:22 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 16:52 est , 10 january 2013 a teenage gunman brought terror to a @entity4 high school today after he shot a fellow student before being talked down by a heroic teacher			1
the shooting is the first at a school since the massacre at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 less than one month ago			0
the shooter , who was carrying up to 20 rounds of ammunition for his 12 - gauge shotgun , fired at a second student but missed before a teacher persuaded him to lay down his weapon			1
the name of the victim has not been released , but he is said to be in critical condition after having surgery for a shotgun wound to the shoulder			0
as the teacher was trying to urge students to exit through a back door to the classroom , a community supervisor arrived on the scene and helped calm the shooter before he was detained by police			1
‘ as the dialogue started with him and the campus supervisor , the student was still armed with the shotgun ... they distracted him , ’ mr @entity40 said			1
damage : two other students reportedly suffered minor injuries in the race to get out of the building , with this girl being transported to hospital after having hearing damage from being so close to the shooter ‘ the heroics of these two people - it goes without saying ... speaks volumes for these two young men and what they could have prevented			1
’ none of the individuals directly involved have been named , but only one person sustained serious injuries from the incident			0
the teacher refused medical attention on the scene even though he was struck in the head by a pellet from the shotgun			1
during the complicated process of exiting the school , one student sustained minor injuries and another had to go to a hospital because she allegedly was standing near the shooter and may have hearing problems as a result			1
official word : @entity32 police chief @entity93 talked to the parents who came to the school after the shooting started in the @entity31 science building around 9am on thursday emergency response : local and federal officials immediately responded to the shooting and went room by room to inspect the school after they apprehended the suspect many students in the building immediately called 911 or their parents as soon as they heard shots fired around 9am , so the police response was extremely quick			1
the sheriff said that two emergency units were on the scene within one minute of the calls			0
after the teacher talked the shooter down , he was taken into custody by police			0
upon interrogation , he said he told the teacher ‘ i do n’t want to shoot you ’ and proceeded to say the name of the student that he did want to shoot			0
the victim has not been officially named but his friends have been tweeting about his condition throughout the course of the day			0
like many other schools across the country , @entity31 was rocked by the events of december 14 , when a shooter killed 20 young children and six adults before killing himself at @entity11			2
in light of that , @entity32 officials went over the emergency response plan and evacuation routes just this morning hours before the shooting			0
response : the sheriff said that two units responded to the scene within one minute of the first emergency calls and local , state and federal officials kept the scene on lock down throughout the afternoon comfort : a number of schools - including a middle school and a community college - are all located near the science building where the shooting took place and students from all of those schools were alerted waiting for word : parents gather outside of @entity31 while they wait to collect their children from the scene of the latest school shooting the shooter was meant to be in the science classroom where he opened fire but did not come to school on time			1
instead he went into the building half - way through the class armed with a shotgun and began to fire			2
at that time , the school bell had just rung at a nearby school and the principal told students to get inside over the intercom			2
a number of students at the @entity4 school called 911 and their parents on their cell phones from inside the school once they heard the sound of the gunshot			1
one girl called 911 then called her mother saying that she was in the classroom where the student had been shot and that the victim was lying on the ground in a pool of blood			1
' my friend 's been shot , the teacher 's been shot - i do n't know what to do , ' the girl reportedly said to her mother on her cell phone			1
a friend of the injured student tweeted that the victim had to go into surgery after being hit in the shoulder with a shotgun			2
the victim , thought to be a male student in his junior year at the school , sustained injuries to his liver , lung and diaphragm due to the direction of the bullet			2
lining up : anxious parents get ready to pick up their students at @entity31 as well as a neighboring middle school waiting for answers : a crowd of either students or parents gathers with police inside a back gate of the school following the shooting earlier in the day securing the grounds : police in bullet - proof vests are seen leaving the science building where the shooting took place a local reporter said that he had spoken with seven different parents who said that the shooter was suspended last year for having a ' hit list ' of students that he wanted to hurt or kill , though officials have refused to comment as they do not yet know all of the facts in the case			1
@entity249 reports that a student admitted to falsely warning of a school shooting at @entity31 in december			1
it is unclear if that student had anything to do with today 's shooting , but when questioned by police in december he admitted that his threat was false			2
the local @entity260 affiliate received two separate calls from people who were hiding in closets during the incident , and the shooter - who is believed to be a student at the school - was taken into custody by police at around 9.20am			1
the shooting took place in the physical sciences building on campus , and the @entity276 building was put on lock - down as a precaution because it is located right next to the school , according to @entity280			2

the public school is located in the small town of @entity32 which is about an hour 's drive outside of @entity305 in southern @entity4			1
the nearby middle school - @entity306 - was shut down as a warning when the shooting at @entity309 was reported			2
