during the @entity29 arrest in june 2013 , @entity0 ’s house was raided and his @entity6 passport confiscated for three months			1

‘ this is the sort of case i would hope would be looked into by the @entity69 select committee in order that some deep digging can be done to find out what ’s gone wrong			0

he said : ‘ i can not say for certain what the consequences will be			0
however , no doubt the @entity6 will be prone to attack from within			0
’ @entity0 gloated over how he gave police the slip en route to @entity1 by flying from @entity15 to @entity16 the jihadi also revealed how he or fellow @entity6 terrorists can return to the @entity6 from @entity1 to launch attacks without being caught by the authorities			1
he said : ‘ there are many loopholes in your system			0
what ’s preventing me from going to @entity126 or @entity30 and coming back to the @entity6 with someone else ’s passport through a student visa ? there are many ways i can return			0
’ when asked if @entity6 jihadis have already returned to the @entity6 to launch attacks , he said ominously : ‘ all i can say is no comment			0
there are certain things i can not say			0
’ @entity137 has said that returning jihadis pose the ‘ greatest and deepest ’ security threat facing @entity6 today , but plans to deal with them are still unclear and no firm commitment has yet been made to new legislation to bar their return			0
last month , the terror threat level was raised from ‘ substantial ’ to ‘ severe ’ , meaning an attack is highly likely			0
