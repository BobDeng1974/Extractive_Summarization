by @entity0 published : 18:02 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 18:03 est , 30 may 2013 @entity1 said ' equal marriages ' could open the door for marriages between siblings a former archbishop of canterbury yesterday warned @entity7 that his ‘ equal marriage ’ reforms open the door for multiple weddings and marriages between siblings			1
@entity1 said that same - sex marriage laws amount to a radical and disturbing upheaval which is likely to lead to unintended consequences			1
among them he listed the inclusion of polygamous and multiple relationships into the definition of marriage , and the right for two sisters living together to demand a legal wedding			0
the intervention from @entity1 , one of the most prominent campaigners against same - sex marriage since the prime minister first announced his plan in the autumn of 2011 , comes as peers prepare to debate the new marriage law			1
ministers are braced for an attempt to wreck the @entity35 next week			1
a group of mps have already written to members of the @entity39 urging them to vote down the @entity40 , on the grounds that in the supposedly free vote in the @entity43 they were warned by @entity44 that their careers would be at stake if they failed to back it			1
@entity1 , 77 , said that the @entity40 overturns the historic understanding of marriage as a platform for a man and a woman to raise children that has lasted since the dawn of @entity56			1
that , he argued in a paper published by the @entity59 think tank , means that the doors will fly open for very different legal versions of marriage in the future			2
‘ a reason why we should be worried by the redefining of marriage is the unintended consequences of such a step , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ once we let go of the exclusivity of a one - man one - woman relationship with procreation linking the generations , they why stop there ? ‘ if it is about love and commitment , then it is entirely logical to extend marriage to two sisters bringing up children together			2
if it is merely about love and commitment , then there is nothing illogical about multiple relationships , such as two women and one man			0
’ the former archbishop , who stepped down from @entity90 in 2002 , cited the arguments of @entity94 academic and lawyer @entity92 , a prominent advocate of gay marriage rights , who has maintained that it is illogical to limit the number of people in a relationship			2
instead he has proposed the scrapping of any laws that limit the numbers or sex of people entering a marriage			1
@entity1 was critical of the idea promoted by home secretary @entity108 that people who care about each other should have the right to marry			2
culture secretary @entity112 ( right ) argued for the reform @entity1 said : ‘ in no way do i mean to be alarmist about the possibility of this happening in a large scale way , but it is happening in the @entity94 and there is nothing to stop the trend continuing			2
’ he added that the idea promoted by home secretary @entity108 that people who care deeply for each other and want to spend their lives together should have the right to marry is ‘ a wholly inadequate understanding of marriage			0
’ the former @entity89 said : ‘ those of us accused of being on the wrong side of history can only plead with the government to respect our concern that extending marriage to same - sex couples is not only unwise , but also sets a dangerous precedent			1
’ lord @entity1 ’s plea for rejection of same - sex marriage was published alongside a series of arguments both in favour and against the reform published by @entity59 in the meaning of matrimony : debating @entity147			1
among contributors was culture secretary @entity112 , the minister in charge of piloting the new law through the @entity43			0
mrs @entity112 said : ‘ much of the strength of marriage lies in its ability to change with the times			0
as society has changed , so marriage has changed , and become available to an increasingly broad range of people			0
‘ in the 21st century marriage is an inclusive - not exclusive - institution			0
it is available to all adults who are prepared to make vows of life - long fidelity and commitment			0
except , that is , if you happen to love someone of the same sex			0
i believe that simply is n’t right			0
