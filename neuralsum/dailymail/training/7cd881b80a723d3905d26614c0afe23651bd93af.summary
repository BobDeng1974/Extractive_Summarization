by @entity0 a young boy had to spend two days with a gaping hole in his chest after open - heart surgery			1
@entity5 , two , was born with a catalogue of heart and bowel problems and has already undergone a series of life - saving operations			1
after the most recent operation , surgeons had to leave his chest open for two days while he recovered			1
@entity5 , two , was born with a catalogue of heart and bowel problems			1
he is pictured with his parents , @entity15 , 40 , and @entity16 , 37 the meant his shocked parents were able to watch his heart beating inside his body			0
but now , after two years in and out of hospital , @entity5 has finally been able to go home to @entity22 with his parents , @entity15 and @entity16			1
his mother said : ‘ his chest was open and when we went up to visit him we could actually see his little heart beating			2
‘ it was such an unnerving experience			0
’ @entity5 ’s long journey to full health started after he was diagnosed with heart and bowel problems when he was born on october 12 , 2011			1
he had necrotizing enterocolitis which is inflammation of the bowel which can lead to bowel damage and even tissue death			0
when he was 12 days old @entity5 had surgery but doctors only gave him a 50 per cent chance of survival last month , @entity5 had more surgery and following the operation his heart stopped			1
surgeons had to reopen his chest and managed to restart his heart			1
they then had to leave his chest open for two days while the swelling around his heart went down he also had truncus arteriosus which is a condition which occurs when there is just one large blood vessel , instead of two , leaving the heart 's ventricles			1
this means oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood can mix and flow from the heart to the body and lungs			0
most children with the condition , including @entity5 , also have a hole between their two ventricles which also allows oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood to mix. finally , @entity5 also had interrupted aortic arch which is where the large blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to the rest of the body is not fully developed			2
he was operated on at 12 days old and his doctors gave him just a 50/50 chance of survival			1
they were so worried he would not survive that they gave his parents the option of just taking him home and letting him fade away			0
@entity5 's parents were terrified that he would not survive the operation but they believe he is a ' little fighter '			2
he is pictured after his operation , once his chest had been closed again @entity5 's parents did not know until after his birth that he would have so many health problems however , they were determined to give him a chance so decided to go ahead with surgery			1
as a result , he had open - heart surgery after a process where his body was cooled to allow surgeons to work on him without him suffering brain damage			1
after 35 days in intensive care he was finally able to go home at eight weeks old			2
but that was n’t the end of the @entity5 family ’s ordeal			0
just before @entity5 ’s second birthday , they found out he would have to undergo open - heart surgery for the second time			1
just last month he went into hospital and , after seven hours of surgery , his parents thought he was finally in the clear			2
@entity5 ( pictured with his parents as a baby ) is now in good health and has been able to go home mr @entity5 said : ' he has fought every step of the way and we 're so proud that he 's never given up ' in fact , a nurse came out to tell them that he had suddenly deteriorated and that a doctor was ‘ working on him ’			2
@entity5 had gone into cardiac arrest and medics had to re-open his chest to keep him alive			2
the 10cm incision was open for two days to create space while the swelling around his heart went down			1
since returning from his second stay in hospital , @entity5 is now thriving and is looking forward to starting nursery			0
his mother , 37 , who works for @entity126 , said : ‘ we did n’t know when i was pregnant that anything was wrong so the hours after he was born were incredibly scary			0
‘ we were always worrying even though we believed he was a fighter			0
‘ it just goes around in the back of your head , what if ? ‘ and when it came to his second heart operation , we were aware that two children we had got to know with similar problems had died when they went in for their second round of surgery			2
mrs @entity141 says that despite @entity143 's brush with death , he has quickly returned to being a ' cheeky monkey ' ‘ then when we found out he ’d gone into cardiac arrest we were obviously in absolute pieces thinking : why did we put him through it ? ‘ but he never gave up and soon he was back to being a little monkey			0
‘ even when his heart was still exposed he tried to get up and out of bed and we had to hold him down so he did n’t injure himself			0
‘ once he was ready to get up he was trying run , not walk			0
‘ we ’re just trying to get back to normal now			0
’ his father , also an engineer at @entity126 , said he was immeasurably proud of his son ’s fighting spirit			0
the 40 - year - old said : ‘ he has fought every step of the way and we ’re so proud that he ’s never given up			0

@entity5 was born with a series of heart and bowel problems
he had surgery at just 12 days old and was given a 50 *%* chance of survival
just last month he then had open - heart surgery - he is now two
after the op his heart stopped and surgeons had to open his chest again
they managed to start his heart but had to leave his chest open
this allowed space for his heart to beat until the swelling had gone down
his chest was open for two days before it could finally be closed
he is now a happy , healthy *toddler* at home with his parents
