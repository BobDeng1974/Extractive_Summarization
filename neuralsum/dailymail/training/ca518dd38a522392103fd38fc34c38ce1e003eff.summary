by @entity1 reporter published : 06:48 est , 2 june 2013 updated : 01:41 est , 3 june 2013 neanderthals lost out to @entity3 in the battle to survive because they were not clever enough to adapt			0
the results of a five - year study , to be revealed this week , will show that modern man walked the planet much earlier than was believed and @entity2 died out much sooner than was estimated			1
the brains of @entity2 were the same size as those of modern man but more of it was used to focus on the physical needs of their larger bodies			1
extinction : neanderthal man had larger eyes but did not develop his brain power like @entity3 modern humans from @entity22 evolved the part of their brains responsible for thinking , which they used to connect with other groups in times of need			1
when the @entity30 came , they could speak a complex language and set up operations far from their homes , unlike @entity2			2
@entity34 was once dominated by @entity2 , but they disappeared after modern man was thought to have emerged 60,000 years ago			1
now , according to the research programme reset – response of humans to abrupt environmental transitions – homo sapiens could have arrived 45,000 years ago			0
skull : neanderthal man focused his brain on his vision and body control human skulls : our frontal lobes used for thinking evolved which helped out social networking and communication skills scientists using radiocarbon dating discovered there appeared to be no neanderthal sites 39,000 years ago – 10,000 years earlier than previous thought			2
homo sapiens could have arrived 45,000 years ago			0
five thousand years later , @entity2 had all but vanished			0
the results of the research will be unveiled at a three - day conference titled when @entity34 was covered by @entity30 and @entity60 , at the @entity61 in @entity62 .			0

study to show modern man walked planet much earlier than believed
