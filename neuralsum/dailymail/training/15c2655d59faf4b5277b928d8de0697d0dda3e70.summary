by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:40 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 31 october 2013 medical insurance companies who speak ill of the @entity4 are getting phone calls from the @entity7 administration warning them to be quiet , according to a new report			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity9 quickly called the report ' preposterous and inaccurate , ' but a @entity13 report alleged wednesday night that insurance executives ' are willing to listen to the @entity10 because right now , it is the federal government that 's [ their ] biggest customer			1
' and a prominent health insurance consultant said during the report that his clients have asked him to go public because they fear retaliation from the government that regulates their business			1
' they feel defenseless before the @entity10 p.r. team			0
the sources said they fear @entity10 retribution , ' @entity13 reporter @entity24 explained			1
' ' the @entity10 , ' said @entity47 chief @entity46 , ' is exerting massive pressure on the industry , including the trade associations , to keep quiet			0
' some of those business have publicly criticized the rollout of the @entity4 anyway , and scoffed at the disastrous performance of its front - end website , healthcare.gov			1
those public rebukes , @entity24 said , bring a swift response from the @entity7 team			0
' basically , if you speak out , if you ’re quoted , you ’re going to get a call from the @entity10 , pressure to be quiet , ' he reported			1
@entity46 said some insurance companies warned the administration early on that the regulations imposed on them would lead to widespread policy cancellations since many of the plans already in force did n't comply with a laundry list of new requirements			0
' i think the administrative mess you ’re seeing right now , ' he said , ' is indicative of what happens when somebody tries to run somebody else 's business who thinks they ’re smarter than you are			0
' the @entity10 quickly denied the claim that it 's warning insurers to stay quiet , calling the report ' preposterous and inaccurate ' under pressure : @entity85 secretary @entity84 withstood aggressive questioning in a congressional hearing wednesday , defending the @entity4 plan against charges that it was causing millions to lose the health insurance plans they chose the @entity10 has taken flak in the past week as news emerged that insurance companies have already cancelled at least 2 million plans bought on the individual market			1
@entity7 had promised for years that @entity1 who wanted to keep their existing insurance would be allowed to keep it			1
but an intensely restrictive set of requirements has squeezed most of those policies out of such ' grandfather ' status , leaving policyholders at the mercy of government - run exchanges – whose biggest website has been chronically out of service since its oct. 1 launch			2
a change to a policy as minor as a tweaked copay schedule or an increased premium will render it ineligible for that ' grandfathered ' status in the future			0
estimates of the number of consumers affected by those cancellations have ranged as high as 20 million			0
@entity123 , the @entity124 administrator who was in charge of the website effort , testified in a congressional hearing tuesday that @entity4 is n't to blame for the zeroed - out policies			2
@entity129 chief @entity46 told @entity130 that ' the administrative mess you 're seeing right now is indicative of what happens when somebody tries to run somebody else 's business ' not our fault : @entity123 , the administrator of the @entity124 , said tuesday on @entity140 that @entity4 was designed to move people from lousy health care plans to better ones ' half of the people in the individual market prior to 2010 did n't stay on their policies , ' @entity123 claimed			2
' they were either kicked off for pre-existing conditions , they saw their premiums go up at least 20 percent a year , and there were no protections for them			0
and sometimes they were in plans that they thought were fine until they actually needed hospitalization , and they found out it did n't cover hospitalization or it did n't cover cancer			0
' @entity85 secretary @entity84 , too , defended the insurance - company cancellations when she had her turn on the congressional hot seat wednesday			2
@entity4 's uniform minimum standards , she claimed , ' will finally provide the kind of protections we all enjoy in our health care plans			2
individuals who buy insurance on their own have never had that kind of health security			0
' that protection comes at a price , however , as millions of @entity1 have found their rates will increase under the @entity4 , including for the young people the @entity10 desperately needs to attract			1
a spokesman for @entity7 told reporters yesterday that ' the president has complete confidence in @entity186			0
' @entity7 , however , has plunged to an all - time low approval rating , with just 42 per cent of @entity1 giving his job performance a thumbs - up .			1
