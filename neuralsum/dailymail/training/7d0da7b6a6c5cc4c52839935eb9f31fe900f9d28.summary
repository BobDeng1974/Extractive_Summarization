@entity0 risks a row with his party by imposing the whip on a controversial vote today asking mps to recognise the state of @entity7			1
@entity5 have been ordered to observe a one - line whip - meaning those who turn up have to back the motion which comes before the @entity10 today			1
but it is understood that several members of the shadow cabinet had asked for it to be free vote so they could abstain , and high - profile members of mr @entity0 ’s frontbench have refused to attend			1
@entity0 has imposed the whip on a controversial vote to recognise the state of @entity7 @entity20 figures who oppose it claim it is ‘ mad ’ to simply recognise a state in principle , rather than support the @entity27 and @entity28 side to engage in meaningful negotiations to make it happen			1
the motion , forced by @entity20 backbencher @entity32 will almost certainly get through as many @entity33 and @entity34 – who have been given a free vote – will also back it			1
one senior @entity20 mp , who is against the vote , said : ‘ it ’s completely mad			0
immediate recognition of a @entity28 state will only encourage hardliners on both sides , when we should be encouraging on both sides who are willing to negotiate a peace deal to do so			0
‘ long , hard , detailed negotiations are the only way to solve the @entity27 - @entity28 conflict			2
this will cause huge anger and bitterness seven months before the election when we should be pulling together			0
’ the @entity28 have long sought to establish an independent , sovereign state in the @entity57 , including @entity58 as its capital , and the @entity60 - where intense fighting took place in july a @entity28 woman carries her daughter past rubble from a home which police said was destroyed in an @entity27 air strike in @entity69 , in the northern of @entity60 in july @entity71 , the former @entity72 minister said the @entity73 had a ‘ historic and moral duty ’ to recognise a @entity28 state , which was last year backed by 134 countries at the @entity76			1
mr @entity71 said : ‘ there is no reason not to			0
we recognised @entity27 in 1948 after a rather nasty civil war there , and now for too long @entity7 has been occupied , they are living a miserable life			1
’ but several members of the shadow cabinet are unlikely to attend including @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , who are all members of @entity90 ( @entity90 )			1
other high - profile absentees are likely to include @entity0 ’s former @entity93 @entity92 , who chair @entity90 , @entity96 , who is @entity93 to @entity97 ; @entity98 , a party spokesperson on public health ; @entity100 , who was a parliamentary aide to @entity101 when he was prime minister ; and @entity102 , the mp for @entity103 and @entity104			2
many mps are concerned that the vote will cause friction within the party just seven months ahead of the election			2
‘ to say that this is an unfortunate situation is an understatement ’ one shadow minister told the @entity111 on sunday			0
‘ the party did n’t need to get itself into this situation			0
‘ there are four statues of prime ministers in the @entity118 - @entity117 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			0
they never solved the @entity123 problem , yet we ’ve gone and got ourselves in a tizzy over it and think we ’ve got a solution			0
’ the motion currently states : ‘ @entity129 believes that the government should recognise the state of @entity7 alongside the state of @entity27			1
’ some @entity5 indicated they would be willing to vote for the motion if it includes an amendment proposed by a senior cross-party group of mps , including the former foreign secretary @entity137 which would add the words ‘ as a contribution to securing a negotiated two - state solution ’			2
@entity141 will decide whether to include the amendment until tomorrow morning			0
’ this summer saw the worst violence in years as @entity27 troops were sent into @entity60 in response to heavy rocket fire and militants infiltrating civilian areas through underground tunnels			1
a cease fire was declared after 2,100 @entity150 including hundreds of children , and 73 @entity27 had been killed			2
@entity152 , the former foreign office minister who resigned this summer calling @entity154 ’s policy on the @entity60 conflict ‘ morally indefensible ’ urged mps to back the motion , claiming it would ‘ breathe new life into the negotiations ’			0
a @entity20 source said : ‘ we would ask mps to vote for party policy , but they are not compelled to attend			0
