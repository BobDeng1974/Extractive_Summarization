radical proposals : the @entity0 @entity17 in @entity18 , where legislators are considering issuing bonds to foreign investors in exchange for citizenship @entity0 has billions of pounds of foreign currency debt maturing in the next few years and needs to find ways to refinance it			1
@entity18 has asked for help from the @entity11 and the @entity28 but talks are dragging on and analysts see only a 50 per cent chance of a deal			2
