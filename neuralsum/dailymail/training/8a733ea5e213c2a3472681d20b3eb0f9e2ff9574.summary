@entity23 's @entity22 was at @entity8 and rates all the players ' performances			2

6 @entity37 : one of those who missed out in @entity14 , returned without any fuss			0
could n’t find any fault in his efforts			0
7 @entity43 : had a running battle with @entity18 and seemed to have him under control until the @entity46 wriggled away at the crucial moment			2
7 @entity7 keeper @entity30 ( right ) is unable to keep the ball from crossing the line for @entity1 's first @entity50 : perhaps fortunate to start after @entity51 did so well in @entity14 ; some good moments , other parts lacked conviction			1
6 @entity55 : excellent in the @entity56 but dropped a level here			0
could he have made more effort to block @entity18 ’s path to goal ? 6 @entity62 : desperate to make up for what happened in april , should have won @entity7 a penalty with a late shot			1
7 @entity7 skipper @entity62 gives chase as @entity70 surges forward with speed @entity72 : bizarrely booked for colliding with @entity73 ; a willing outlet but had to make much of his own opportunities			1
6.5 @entity9 : kept his place after doing well in @entity14 and was at the heart of @entity7 ’s best moments early on , scoring their goal			1
7 scorer of @entity7 's opener , @entity9 ( right ) , contests a bouncing ball with @entity1 's @entity84 @entity85 : work rate and energy never in question			1
one chance blocked at the end , tried too hard to make something happen			0
6.5 @entity92 : a few nice touches , one driving run but was weak for @entity1 ’s second goal and did n’t get in the game enough			2
5.5 @entity97 : some selfless runs early on but then his impact fizzled out			0
booked for a stupid foul on @entity101 in second half			0
5.5 @entity97 appeals to the referee after a challenge from @entity26 subs : @entity106 6 ( for can 70 ) , @entity107 6 ( for @entity92 70 ) , @entity108 ( for @entity97 79 ) unused : @entity109 , @entity51 , @entity110 , @entity111 @entity1 @entity112 : wrong - footed for the goal that he conceded but otherwise never put a glove out of place ; one fine stop from @entity72			1
7.5 @entity118 : every successful team needs a player like this teak - tough @entity121			0
does his job immaculately every week.7.5 @entity123 : will never win a popularity contest but is still the best @entity126 central defender in the country			2
8 @entity17 celebrates scoring @entity1 's equaliser after goal line technology made the decision in their favour @entity17 : playing alongside @entity123 has helped him mature into a defender of the highest calibre ; lucky to get away with a late handball			1
7.5 @entity136 : another who does n’t get headlines but does a crucial job ; superb run and cross created the winner for @entity18			1
8 @entity84 : @entity142 passed him by for large periods			1
only seen him when he was complaining to the referee			0
5.5 @entity26 : @entity146 fails to impress			0
he gave the team talk before hand and led by example during the game			0
8.5 usually the pass master , this was a match which largely passed @entity84 by @entity73 : like @entity84 , struggled to making an impression going forward			2
worked hard but eventually substituted			0
6 @entity70 : took the breath away at times with his speed , balance and skill			0
@entity161 had @entity7 when on the ball			0
8 @entity101 : a couple of neat touches , kept play ticking over smoothly and never stopped running but booked for a wild lunge at @entity37			0
7 @entity18 : makes things happen and scores the goals when they are needed ; another one to take @entity1 closer to the title			2
8 @entity18 shows the signs of a physical contest with a rip down the back of his shirt subs : @entity178 6.5 ( for @entity73 54 ) , @entity179 ( for @entity180 ) @entity177 ( for hazard 90 ) @entity181 : @entity26			1
