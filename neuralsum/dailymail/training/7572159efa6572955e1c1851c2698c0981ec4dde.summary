@entity1 , which is pushing to arm rebels fighting president @entity15 's army , said the use of the gas was in breach of all international protocols			1
photographs have already been produced of victims including young children dying from the chemicals			1
worrying : the aftermath of an air strike in @entity26 after the announcement about chemical weapons @entity10 is odourless , and so hard to detect , of ten leaving people with no idea that they were have been exposed to the gas			1
within a few minutes , victims experience runny nose , tightness in the chest , and pupil constriction			2
then they have difficulty breathing , get sick , and start to drool before they lose control of all their bodily functions , begin twitching and ultimately suffocate in a series of convulsive spasms			0
' it is a horrendous death , and one that the international community can not allow , ' said a foreign ministry source in the @entity1 capital			1
both @entity15 and the @entity7 rebels have accused each other of using chemical weapons , but this is the first solid evidence of ' localised use ' said mr @entity8			1
march as the bloodiest month of the conflict so far , with more than 6,000 people killed , including more than 500 women and children			1
some 70,000 people are thought to have died since the uprising began in march 2011 as part of the @entity64 revolution across the @entity65 and @entity66			0
hundreds of thousands more have been wounded , imprisoned and made homeless			0
@entity10 was first developed in @entity67 in 1938 by two scientists who were trying to create a stronger pesticide			1
allegations : this image shows forces loyal to @entity15 during an operation ; they are accused of using sarin when its potential for chemical warfare was realised during the @entity79 , the @entity75 started mass - producing it , but it was never used			1
@entity81 listed @entity10 as a standard chemical weapon in the 1950s , but it was not used properly until 1988 when @entity85 dictator @entity84 used it to wipe out some 5000 people in the @entity89 city of @entity90 , in northern @entity85			1
they all died over the course of two days when some 20 aircraft dropped the chemicals on the town			2
sarin gas was also said to have been used during the @entity97 in 2004 , with the west using it as evidence of the banned weapons of mass destruction the @entity104 and @entity105 governments claimed @entity85 possessed			0
mr @entity8 said : ' these tests show the presence of sarin in various samples in our possession			1
@entity1 is certain that sarin gas was used several times in @entity7 in limited areas			1
' mr @entity8 said that the test results had been handed to the @entity116 because chemical weapons are banned by international law			1
concerns : the report to the @entity121 on violations in @entity7 's conflict accused both sides of committing war crimes during the conflict it came as a @entity116 report stated that there were ' reasonable grounds ' to suggest that chemical weapons were being used in @entity7			1
mr @entity8 would not state whether the @entity10 had been used by the @entity132 , or by the rebels			1
the disclose comes after a @entity116 report said today that there are ' reasonable grounds ' to believe that toxic chemicals have been used as weapons in at least four attacks in @entity7 's civil war			1
the @entity116 @entity141 said more evidence is needed to determine the precise chemical agents used or who used them and called on @entity146 to allow a team of experts into the country			2
the report said there are allegations of government forces using chemical weapons in four instances , but also did not rule out rebels using them			2
the commission 's report to the @entity121 on violations in @entity7 's conflict also accused both sides of committing war crimes			2
in an apparent message to @entity166 countries considering arming @entity7 rebels , the report warned that the transfer of arms would heighten the risk of violations , leading to more civilian deaths and injuries			2
' war crimes and crimes against humanity have become a daily reality in @entity7 where the harrowing accounts of victims have seared themselves on our conscience , ' the report said			2
' there is a human cost to the increased availability of weapons , ' it added			0
@entity116 - secretary general @entity188 has appointed a @entity116 team to investigate alleged chemical weapons attacks in @entity7 after the @entity7 government asked him to investigate a purported attack by rebels on march 19 on @entity194 in the northern city of @entity196			1
but the @entity7 government insists that a probe be limited to that incident			0
@entity7 soldiers were reportedly killed and injured in the incident , which the rebels blame on @entity7 forces			0
opposition activists have claimed more than six instances when regime forces used chemical weapons			0
@entity188 is insisting on a broader investigation , including a december incident in @entity208			0
he appointed @entity211 chemical weapons expert @entity209 to lead a @entity116 investigation			2
@entity7 has refused to allow his team into the country			0
the confirmed use of chemical weapons could escalate the international response to the more than two - year - old conflict , which has killed more than 70,000 people , according to the @entity116			2
president @entity220 has said their use would be a ' red line , ' but the administration says it still looking for solid evidence			0
' there are reasonable grounds to believe that chemical agents have been used as weapons , ' the report said			1
' it has not been possible , on the evidence available , to determine the precise chemical agents used , their delivery systems or the perpetrator			0
' ' it is possible that anti-government armed groups may access and use chemical weapons ...			0
though there is no compelling evidence that these groups possess such weapons or their requisite delivery systems , ' the report said			0
' conclusive findings - particularly in the absence of a large - scale attack - may be reached only after testing samples taken directly from victims or the site of the alleged attack , ' it said			0
the report , covering the period from mid-january to mid-may , accused both sides of committing war crimes			0
on the government side , the report accused government forces and affiliated militia of committing torture , rape , forcible displacement and enforced disappearance			0
on the rebel side , the report accused armed groups of carrying out sentencing and execution without due process , as well as committing torture , taking hostages and pillaging			0
but it said violations and abuses by the rebels ' did not , however , reach the intensity and scale of those committed by government forces and affiliated militia			0
' ' a dangerous state of fragmentation and disintegration of authority prevails in areas under anti-government armed groups control , despite attempts to fill the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the state through creating local councils , ' it said .			0
