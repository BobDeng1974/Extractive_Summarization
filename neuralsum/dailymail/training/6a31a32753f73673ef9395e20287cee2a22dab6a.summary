by @entity0 from hand - cut fur pom poms to hooded fur gilets , @entity3 's @entity2 show was almost entirely made up of the controversial material putting it firmly back on the fashion map for the coming season			1
behind the scenes , the fur industry is fighting back , encouraged , it seems , by fashion 's most influential - such as @entity13 and @entity14 - who trot out draped in the stuff			1
so is fur back in fashion and will we all be wearing it come autumn ? apparently so , if the latest figures released by the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) are anything to go by			1
new statistics show that globally , the fur trade is worth £ 24bn - that 's roughly the same as the global @entity27 market - while sales of fur products are estimated at £ 21.52bn			1
back in fashion : fur , as seen everywhere on @entity3 's @entity2 catwalk , is a trade now worth £ 24bn and who 's to blame ? the catwalks , according to @entity36 , the ceo of the @entity20			1
' it 's easy to get caught up in the emotions the business can generate , but the truth is that the fur trade is an economic cornerstone in @entity43 and beyond			1
much of the fashion and increasingly the soft furnishings world relies on fur - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future , ' he said			1
speaking to @entity52 about the news , @entity51 founder @entity50 said : ' fur is so cheap these days that furriers have resorted to paying designers and celebrities to use it , but its cheapness is reflected in the world of @entity63 freebies and the shallowness of the wearer			2
' designer @entity66 , who came to the attention of the wider public after designing the former @entity70 's wedding dress , set the season 's tone by sending her models down the runway as fairy - tale heroines roaming a make - believe forest with their fur - embellished gowns trailing behind them			1
this is a stark contrast to the late @entity82 when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the thought of so much as a mink - trimmed cuff			2
@entity51 ( @entity51 ) was born and in 1994 five supermodels posed nude to protest against wearing fur , along with the slogan ' i 'd rather go naked than wear fur			2
' this campaign has run and run and was most recently fronted by @entity63			0
such was public disgust , those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to find themselves splattered with red paint ( or a dead raccoon in @entity101 's case )			0
but these good intentions did n't last long and slowly , fur crept back into fashion			2
while a recent @entity107 poll found that 95 per cent of @entity109 women say they would n't wear fur , the new figures speak for themselves			2
wrapping up warm : supermodel of the moment @entity113 can often be spotted wearing her fur - trimmed hood coat @entity115 ? @entity116 once posed in favour of anti-fur but seems to have changed her mind remember when ... ? @entity120 also seems to be an avid fan of fur goods despite once posing for @entity51 speaking about designers ' use of fur , a @entity51 spokesperson said : ' fashion designers should be forward - thinking innovators			1
in contrast , parading animal pelts down the catwalk is simply archaic			2
' @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 are just some of the designers that shun fur and instead work with luxurious , exciting , sophisticated , cruelty - free fabrics , from metals to spun acrylic and satin , and we hope to see @entity147 embrace new cutting - edge fabrics that do n't bleed			1
in this day and age , there 's absolutely no reason for animals to be killed for fashion			0
' ' i wonder how many animals had to die for @entity156 and @entity14 's wardrobes			1
they might be chart toppers , but they 're also barbarians ' fashion blogger @entity160 was appalled by what he saw on the recent catwalk			2
he said : ' i actually gasped out loud when i trawled through the catwalk shots from @entity66 ’s latest @entity3 adventure			2
not out of joy , but of sheer horror at the amount of fur she decided to use			2
' the collection is named ‘ @entity173 ’ – but i ’m inclined to add an – ly onto the end of the latter			0
do these designers just turn a blind eye to the fur industry ? do they just think it happens to fall off the animals in a glorious , gift - giving way like apples dropping from their branches ? ' i realise there are those customers who demand fur , who love to wrap themselves up in the stuff , but it ’s down to the labels and editors ( yes , you @entity101 ! ) to stop this happening			1
you can do glamour without skinning foxes and mink alive – just look to @entity132 or brilliant faux fur label , @entity197			0
i imagine if these fashion houses decided to turn around imitation fur pieces too , they ’d sell like hotcakes			0
fur , fur , everywhere : the collection is named ' @entity173 ' - but i 'm inclined to add an - ly onto the end of the latter , says @entity160 ' you can bet your bottom dollar that the @entity70 wo n’t be seen in any furry @entity3 creations , she might even stay clear of the label altogether now			1
and i would n’t blame her			0
mr and mrs @entity214 love a bit of fur , and i wonder how many animals had to die for @entity156 and @entity14 ’s wardrobes			1
they might be chart toppers , but they ’re also barbarians			0
' celebrity stylist @entity221 added : ' unfortunately , it does not surprise me one bit that there is fur on the @entity3 catwalk			1
it 's everywhere and is not just reserved for autumn			0
this @entity228 , @entity229 have shaved mink dresses and the @entity232 catwalk is full of fur - and that ’s for the hot summer months ! ' gone are the days of supermodels posing for anti-fur campaigns with slogans such as " i 'd rather go naked than wear fur "			1
@entity241 was deemed non-pc but now that rule has been totally sidelined			0
fur seems to have been made not only fashionable but to be the ultimate in luxury by the design houses			0
big fan : @entity14 has no qualms about her penchant for fur coats and often sports fur stoles too generation cruel ? @entity254 , @entity13 and @entity214 have all been spotted wearing fur coats - even though @entity214 's sister @entity256 is the face of @entity51 's anti-fur campaign ' as a passionate animal lover , i find this very hard to stomach			1
i find it absolutely shocking that fur is being so accepted and is now trimmed on nearly every parka or winter coat you see on the high street			0
' there are some seriously good faux fur available now , especially from @entity197 ( sold on @entity271 ) which is the ultimate in cool and does n’t hurt a soul			0
of course it does n’t help that celebrities such as @entity214 , @entity13 and @entity276 wear fur			1
' if only they could see how it does n’t need to be real to be on trend - see how good @entity282 and @entity283 look - you ca n't even tell it is n't the real thing			0
' encouragingly , several industry heavyweights all refuse to use fur in their collections			0
@entity132 is one designer for whom pelts just do n't pay , telling @entity291 that : ' everything in my store and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here			0
' and she 's not alone			0
sir @entity308 's @entity307 , which includes @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 , as well as @entity313 , @entity302 , @entity133 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 have all pledged not to sell fur			0
even prestigious @entity317 haunt and celebrity nightspot @entity315 has vowed to turn away anyone wearing fur at the door - proving that you can have a look that kills without killing animals			2
wrapped up : @entity323 sports a fur hat to watch the races during the @entity326			0

the fur trade is worth £ 24bn
sales of fur products are estimated at £ 21.52bn
@entity20 say catwalks to blame
there were hand - cut fur pom poms and hooded fur gilets on the @entity2 catwalk
