the @entity7 authorities claim there is evidence of his involvement but @entity2 's supporters have answers for many of the questions raised			1
why did the @entity100 enlist the services of cabbie @entity56 instead of using a designated hotel taxi ? a @entity2 family spokesman said there was nothing unusual in jumping into a taxi on arrival at a foreign airport			2
