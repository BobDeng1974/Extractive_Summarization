by @entity0 when @entity1 wants to get something off his chest about children 's tv , the powers that be might want to take notice			1
a legend of the genre , during his 71 - year showbiz career @entity1 's not only voiced 70s hit @entity12 ( yes , every character ) , but he 's also read more @entity15 stories than anyone else and , in 2009 , was awarded a @entity17 for his children 's tv work			1
but today he 's not happy			2
' children 's tv is so frantic now , they 've neglected the fundamentals of traditional storytelling , ' he says			1
@entity1 thinks that all the old fashioned charm of children 's tv has been lost ' there 's too much fast editing and @entity29 - the very opposite of @entity15			1
' which is why he became involved with the popular @entity32 teatime tv series @entity33 , a mix of live action and animation in which he plays a retired fisherman who tells tall tales about his fantastic adventures with his faithful @entity42 dog salty			1
' what i like about @entity46 's boat is that it 's just like @entity15 - me telling a tale straight to camera with my lovely dog			1
' the sad irony of @entity1 's life , however , is that he and his wife @entity53 - who 've been married since 1955 - could n't have children of their own in those pre-ivf days after she suffered an early miscarriage			1
' it would have been nice to be parents , but i do n't feel wistful about it any more , ' he says			0
' if we 'd had our own children , they 'd all be bigger than me now and shouting at me , ' he adds @entity64 they acquired lots of godchildren and a succession of beloved dogs			2
' they could well have been child substitutes without us knowing , ' admits @entity1			1
' the thing about dogs is they give you unconditional love - and they do n't have teenage years ! ' their last dog @entity77 was a ' delightful ' @entity78 that died three years ago , and they have n't been able to bring themselves to replace her			0
naturally , @entity1 was involved in the casting of @entity83 , whose real name is @entity85			2
@entity1 ( pink shirt ) and @entity87 in @entity88 in 1963 there 's talk of a new series of @entity33 spin - off , @entity94 's @entity93 , as well as a dog show for the @entity98 's @entity97 charity next year , to which @entity1 - who did his @entity99 in the @entity98 - hopes to take @entity100 along as star guest			1
meanwhile , his latest family project sees him recording the narration for sir @entity106 's children 's musical brilliant - @entity104 , which begins a @entity108 tour of theatres next spring			1
he hopes the show will introduce a new generation of children to the simple joys of live theatre			2
the @entity104 show tells the story of how a hurricane opens up a cave in @entity119 and reveals a reptile that 's been hibernating for 65 million years			1
' the dinosaur will be 100ft long , female and wearing pink lipstick , ' says @entity1			2
@entity46 's boat is shown on @entity125 , weekdays at 5.45pm now 85 , @entity1 's been performing for as long as sir @entity126 , and says he has no plans to retire			1
' showbusiness keeps me young			0
i 'll carry on until i have to stop			0
if i was n't producing the goods they 'd get someone else in			0
' he 's worked with everyone from comedy legend @entity135 and the first @entity137 girl @entity136 to @entity138 and @entity139 in @entity140			0
he was even a pop singer in the early 60s with the novelty hits @entity143 and @entity144			0
one of the last survivors of the carry on films , @entity1 never thinks of himself as a star			2
' i 'm like an itinerant fruit - picker , going from orchard to orchard to pick up work , ' says the @entity154 - born son of a plumber 's mate			0
he met @entity53 when he was a young stage manager / actor in @entity154 and she was his assistant			0
' she would often join me on tour or on foreign film shoots			0
it 's very easy to get tempted in my business if you 're feeling fruity , ' says @entity1 , who claims he still gets a funny turn at the memory of working with the beautiful @entity136 in the 1965 adventure film she			1
' but i always wanted to keep on the straight and narrow , just do the job i love and go home , ' he concludes			0
and his favourite audience of all ? ' children - they 're wonderfully receptive			0
so although i do n't have any of my own , i feel very lucky i 've got lots of other children who sit and listen to my stories			0
' @entity33 , @entity125 , weekdays , 5.45pm			2
brilliant - @entity104 will begin a @entity108 tour next spring .			0
