if you have ever watched a dog drink water , you will know that it can be a splashy and messy affair			1
but until now scientists have not been exactly sure why , assuming that canines use their tongues like an inefficient ladle			2
high - speed cameras have now revealed that dogs ‘ smash ’ their tongues against the water to create water columns , which feed into their mouths			1
dogs and cats have large jaws and ‘ incomplete cheeks ’ typical of a predatory quadruped , allowing to open their mouths wide to deliver killer blows			2
but what makes hunting possible also makes drinking using suction impossible			0
unable to seal their cheeks completely , there is no way for a dog to suck up water , unlike humans , who have ‘ complete ’ cheeks , which allow us to create negative pressure and suck water into their mouths			2
dogs ca n't such liquid due to their ' incomplete cheeks '			0
they smash their tongues on the water 's surface to create splashes			2
when a dog withdraws its tongue from water , it creates a significant amount of acceleration - roughly five times that of gravity - that creates the water columns that feed up into its mouth			1
the columns of water ‘ pinch off ’ and detach from the water bath primarily due to gravity			2
dogs are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back to the bath , allowing them to drink			1
while cats lack suction too , they drink using a two part ‘ water entry and exit ’ process by placing the tip of their tongue on the water ’s surface and rapidly withdrawing it to generate a column of water under their retracting tongue			1
@entity83 , an assistant professor at @entity19 , said : ‘ when we started this project , we thought that dogs drink similarly to cats			1
' but it turns out that it 's different , because dogs smash their tongues on the water surface - they make lots of splashing - but a cat never does that			1
’ when a dog withdraws its tongue from water , it creates a significant amount of acceleration - roughly five times that of gravity - that creates the water columns that feed up into its mouth			1
to model this , professor @entity83 placed cameras under the surface of a water trough to map the total surface area of the dogs ' tongues that splashed down when drinking			2
the researchers found that heavier dogs drink water with the larger wetted area of the tongue			1
when dogs withdraw their tongue from water , they create a significant amount of acceleration - roughly five times that of gravity - that creates the water columns that feed up into their mouths			1
canines are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back again this finding suggests that there ’s a relationship between the water contact area of a dog 's tongue and its body weight , so the volume of water a dog 's tongue can move increases relative to its body size			1
in order to better understand how the physiology works , professor @entity83 and his colleagues made models of different sized dogs ’ tongues and mouths using glass tubes			1
this allowed them to mimic the acceleration and water column formation created when a dog splashes its tongue one water ’s surface			2
they then measured the volume of water withdrawn			0
the scientists found that the column of water ‘ pinches off ’ and detaches from the water bath primarily due to gravity			1
this means that dogs are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back to the bath - just like cats			1
they will today describe the findings at the @entity173 's @entity172 ( @entity174 ) meeting in @entity176 , @entity177			0
dogs and cats have large jaws and ‘ incomplete cheeks ’ typical of a predatory quadruped , allowing to open their mouths wide to deliver killer blows			2
but cats drinks differently to dogs and are more delicate in 1940 , @entity184 discovered that when cats lap , they extend their tongues straight down toward the bowl with the tip of the tongue curled backwards , so that the top of the tongue touches the liquid first			0
three years ago , a team from @entity194 , @entity19 and @entity195 built upon his study by using high speed cameras to discover that the top of the cat 's tongue is the only surface to touch liquid			1
cats , unlike dogs , do n’t dip their tongues into the liquid , so the cat ’s lapping mechanism is far more subtle and elegant			0
the smooth tip of the tongue barely touches the surface of the liquid before the cat draws its tongue back up			0
as it does so , a column of liquid forms between the moving tongue and the liquid ’s surface			0
the cat then closes its mouth , pinching off the top of the column for a nice drink , while keeping its chin dry			0
this part of the process is similar to how a dog drinks			0
three years ago , a team from @entity194 , @entity19 and @entity195 built upon his study by using high speed cameras to discover that the top of the cat 's tongue is the only surface to touch liquid			1
a video referenced in the study is shown when the cat ’s tongue touches the liquid surface , some of the liquid sticks to it through liquid adhesion , much as water adheres to a human palm when it touches the surface of a pool			0
but the cat draws its tongue back up so rapidly that for a fraction of a second , inertia - the tendency of the moving liquid to continue following the tongue - overcomes gravity , which is pulling the liquid back down toward the bowl			0
the cat instinctively knows just when this delicate balance will change and it closes its mouth in the instant before gravity overtakes inertia			0
if the cat hesitates , the column will break , so that the liquid would fall back into the bowl and the tongue would come up empty			0
while the domestic cat averages about four laps per second , big cats , such as tigers , know to slow down			0
because their tongues are larger , they lap more slowly to achieve the same balance of gravity and inertia .			0

scientists at @entity19 and @entity20 modelled fluid dynamics at play when dogs drink water - and it 's different to a cat 's *technique*
high - speed cameras have revealed that dogs ‘ smash ’ their tongues against the water to create water columns , which feed into their mouths
canines are smart enough to close their mouths just before the water column collapses back again , enabling them to drink without suction
scientists found larger dogs use more of their tongues to ' scoop ' water
