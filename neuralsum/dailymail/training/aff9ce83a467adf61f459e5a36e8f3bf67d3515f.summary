two seats will be contested at the general election where the majority of voters were born overseas			1
a record four million people born abroad will be able to vote in may after a decade of mass immigration , a study predicted yesterday			1
the figure – up 500,000 since the last election – represents one - tenth of the electorate			1
in a historic development , more than half of those eligible to vote in @entity12 ’s @entity11 and @entity14 seats were born overseas			1
in two seats - @entity11 and @entity14 - more than half of voters were born outside the @entity19 in 10 areas outside the capital at least a quarter of voters are foreign born , according to the study such voters will make up a third of the electorate in another 25 seats , and at least a quarter in a further 50 constituencies , according to experts at @entity30			1
their report says those born abroad are likely to hold the balance of power in 20 key constituencies – including 12 @entity35 marginals , six @entity37 seats and two held by the @entity38			1
the country that provides the most foreign - born voters in @entity41 and @entity42 is @entity43 , followed by @entity44 , the @entity45 and @entity46			1
the figures , compiled for the @entity48 ’ @entity49 , include up to two million immigrants granted @entity19 citizenship since 2000			0
about 200,000 applications are now approved every year – or one every two - and - a - half minutes			0
large numbers arrived when @entity35 was operating an ‘ open - door ’ immigration policy – a strategy designed , according to @entity35 adviser @entity56 , to ‘ rub the @entity58 ’s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date ’			2
the 3.98million voters born overseas includes up to a million from the @entity63 who do not have @entity19 citizenship			1
former @entity35 minister @entity65 is the mp in @entity14 while shadow minister @entity66 is mp for @entity11 recent analysis by @entity68 , based on the 2011 census , showed there are 960,000 who have the right to vote in @entity41 and @entity42			1
under arcane rules , citizens of 54 independent sovereign states can register on the electoral roll as long as they have an address in @entity19			0
in many cases , the arrangements are not reciprocal			0
britons are not allowed to vote in @entity81 , @entity82 or the three most populous countries in the @entity63 – @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity84			2
in 2008 , a report commissioned by the then prime minister @entity86 called for changes in the rules to prevent @entity63 nationals without @entity19 citizenship from voting in general elections			2
the report was never acted upon by the @entity93 – nor has the issue been addressed by the @entity95			0
@entity68 has suggested that ‘ one possible reason ’ why @entity35 ignored the report was that minority voters are more likely to support the party			2
the @entity100 , an anti-racism organisation , found that 68 per cent of these voters backed @entity35 in the 2010 election			1
the conservatives and @entity38 received just 16 per cent and 14 per cent of their votes respectively			0
the authors of yesterday ’s report said that although migrants will not vote as a bloc , patterns suggest they are likely to prefer parties viewed as ‘ positive ’ about race equality and immigration			1
they added that the growing significance of the ‘ migrant vote ’ is being largely ignored by the main parties			2
co-author @entity116 told @entity117 : ‘ migrant voters are almost as numerous as current @entity120 supporters , but they are widely overlooked and risk being increasingly disaffected by mainstream politics and the fierce rhetoric around immigration caused partly by the rise of @entity120			2
‘ @entity19 is more than ever an outward - facing , globalised country with a huge , hardworking , mobile electorate born overseas			1
however , the political debate fails to reflect that contemporary reality in any meaningful way			0
@entity120 have made all the running with the immigration debate in the past few years and we have seen all of the parties looking to offer a harder line on migrants			2
‘ but there is another side to this debate – millions of hardworking @entity19 citizens who came to this country from abroad who find this kind of rhetoric profoundly alienating			0
‘ if the parties do not respond to that then they face lasting damage as this electorate is only going to become more significant			0
’ @entity152 citizens are permitted to vote in local elections but not parliamentary contests			0
this week , @entity120 ’s @entity155 said they should also be barred from any future referendum on @entity152 membership			0
last night @entity68 chairman @entity158 of @entity159 said : ‘ this report underlines the absurdity of giving the vote in @entity19 to foreign citizens from @entity63 countries which do not give the vote to @entity19 residents in their own countries			1
‘ this is an issue which has been ducked for too long			0
it is not a question of hostility			0
it is a question of honesty and common sense			0

in @entity11 and @entity14 more than 50 *%* of voters are foreign born
*4million* people born overseas will be able to vote in may ’s general election
number is up by 500,000 in only five years and represents one in 10 voters
