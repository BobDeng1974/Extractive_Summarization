by @entity0 [ @entity1 ] critics of @entity4 's decision to increase foreign aid to @entity6 came under fire today after it emerged that fewer than one per cent of @entity6 paid any income tax			1
a cross-party group of @entity11 warned that @entity13 taxpayers should no longer be made to bail out @entity6 's poor when wealthy @entity6 refuse to pay taxes themselves			1
revelations about the scale of tax avoidance in @entity6 come as the @entity13 prepares to boost its aid to the country by nearly £ 180m			1
the @entity20 warns that ‘ corruption is rife ’ in @entity6 and that the local elite ‘ does not pay meaningful amounts of tax ’			1
those accused of not paying all the tax they should include president @entity27 , former prime minister @entity28 , and interior minister @entity29			0
the @entity13 government has announced plans to end aid to @entity33 by 2015 , but at the same time the amount of money going to its neighbour @entity6 is set to soar from £ 267 million now to £ 446 million in 2014/15 , making it the biggest recipient of foreign aid			1
during their inquiry mps were told that while one in three people in @entity6 live on less than 30p a day , around 70 per cent of the nation ’s mps do not file a tax return			1
the country has one of the smallest tax bases in the world , with only 0.57 per cent of @entity6 paying income tax last year			2
critics say while some of them pay tax on their official salary , it is often negligible compared to the the tax they ought to pay over all their undeclared income streams			2
the @entity11 today demand that prime minister @entity4 pushes for action on corruption and tax evasion from @entity6 ’s leaders			2
and the @entity20 is calling for the government to use its influence within the @entity64 to press for urgent reform of the tax system			0
most @entity13 money sent to @entity6 goes towards education , health and governance issues			2
but the report takes aim at the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) for failing to put action to tackle corruption , failures of the rule of law and low tax collection at the top of the agenda for its governance work in @entity6			2
the mps conclude : ‘ any increase in the @entity13 ’s official development assistance to @entity6 must be conditional on @entity6 increasing its tax collection and widening the tax base			1
‘ we can not expect the people in the @entity13 to pay taxes to improve education and health in @entity6 if the @entity6 elite is not paying income tax			1
‘ we can not advocate that the @entity13 people finance , through taxation , the proposed substantial increase in development assistance to @entity6 unless there is clear evidence that the newly elected @entity6 government is also willing to make the necessary changes so as to contribute more to improving the livelihood of its people			2
’ the findings of @entity11 led by @entity105 , left , will anger critics of @entity4 's commitment to foreign aid in a damning indictment of the @entity6 elite , the @entity11 conclude : ‘ corruption is rife in a social order based on patronage and kinship networks			1
' @entity6 ’s rich do not pay taxes and exhibit little interest in improving conditions and opportunities for @entity6 ’s poor			0
’ the committee said that there was a ' powerful case ' for continuing @entity13 aid			1
@entity20 chairman the @entity123 mp sir @entity105 said : ' there is a powerful case for maintaining the @entity13 's bilateral aid to @entity6			1
' @entity13 enjoys a close relationship and has long established ties with @entity6 which has real poverty and serious security problems			2
poverty continues to be a serious problem in @entity6 , where one in three lives on less than 30p a day ‘ many people in @entity6 who live below the poverty line gain from the projects supported by the @entity13 @entity73 ’s valuable programmes in education , health and governance			0
‘ but the committee is concerned that not enough tax is raised in @entity6 to fully finance improvements in the quality of life for poor people			0
' in particular , we can not expect people in the @entity13 to pay taxes to improve education and health in @entity6 if the @entity6 elite does not pay meaningful amounts of income tax			1
‘ @entity6 ’s rich must in turn demonstrate a clearer commitment to improving conditions and basic opportunities for all their fellow citizens by paying more in tax than they do under present arrangements			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity73 told @entity166 tax reform was needed in @entity6 ' from the top down '			0
he said : ' this @entity169 report rightly sets out the urgent need for the incoming @entity6 government to deliver tax reform			0
' that reform must start from the top down , with elected politicians and the wealthiest in @entity6 showing a commitment to reform by submitting tax returns and paying tax due			0
' the @entity13 government is clear that @entity13 development assistance in @entity6 is predicated on a commitment to economic and tax reform and to helping lift the poorest out of poverty			1
' we have made it clear to government and opposition politicians in @entity6 that it is not sustainable for @entity13 tax payers to fund development spend if @entity6 is not building up its own stable tax take			2
' following the election we will make available practical assistance to the incoming government to help deliver reform of the @entity6 tax system and work with the @entity64 , but tax and economic reform must take place			0
' sir @entity201 , the @entity202 mp for @entity203 , said that for @entity13 to continue to devote 0.7 per cent of its expenditure to aid did not make sense , and added that spending at such a rate would mean cuts to our own defence budget			0
he told @entity210 : ' it is not right that the @entity13 taxpayer , particularly in these times of austerity , should be shelling out aid			0
they are subsidising tax avoidance in @entity6			0
' but @entity6 's high commissioner @entity219 said that the country was now cracking down on tax avoidance , with those who did not pay tax now banned from running for office			1
he said @entity13 should continue to prop up the country after its infrastructure had been destroyed by warring in the area			0
mr @entity219 told the @entity228 : ' i would say that they [ @entity13 ] should continue paying knowing well what sort of problems we have [ been ] put into by this 30 - year - long war against terrorism in the region ... ' ' we have spent $ 67bn ( £ 44bn ) since 2011 in this war against terror , our infrastructure has been destroyed , our education has been destroyed			0

@entity13 aid for @entity6 will soar from £ 267m now to £ 446m in 2014/15
@entity20 : corruption is ' rife ' in @entity6
@entity20 says around 70 per cent of the nation 's mps do not pay any tax
