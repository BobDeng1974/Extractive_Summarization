@entity5 uses dead darkling beetles to create biodegradable ‘ insect plastic ’ by melting together their shells and claims that with some research it could be one solution to reducing the amount of plastic waste dumped in landfill sites			1
the @entity16 scientist currently uses her innovative material to craft unusual jewellery and lamps			1
@entity5 uses dead darkling beetles to create biodegradable ' insect plastic ' ( pictured ) by melting together their shells and claims it could be one solution to reducing the amount of plastic waste dumped in landfill sites to make one small sheet of the plastic , called coleoptera , after the @entity29 word for beetle , ms @entity5 currently handpicks the shells from 2,500 dead beetles			1
the shells can then be moulded together to produce a piece of coleopteran 10 centimetres squared as they contain a natural plastic called chitin			2
ms @entity5 uses a chemical process to transform the chitin into chitosan , which bonds better due to a variation in the molecular composition			0
‘ i press these shields together with a heat press and i get the insect plastic			2
‘ it took me six months to develop the insect plastic what i have right now , ’ she said			2
@entity5 uses dead darkling beetles ( pictured ) to create biodegradable insect plastic the @entity16 scientist currently uses her innovative material to craft unusual jewellery and lamps ( pictured ) despite the painstaking process , she hopes the material could one day be an alternative for normal plastic			1
a staggering 270,000 tonnes of the manmade non-biodegradable material is thrown away every year in the @entity58 alone , which is around 15 million bottles per day			0
the beetle plastic is not only less wasteful as it is biodegradable , but the animals themselves are the byproduct of mealworms , which are farmed for pet food and bait and would otherwise be thrown away			0

‘ for that reason i started cultivate mealworms to see what other positive values insects have			0
‘ mealworms are bred for the food industry , primarily for the use of animal feed , and are the larval form of the darkling beetle			0
‘ the beetles die three or four months after laying their eggs and are then seen as waste			0
i decided to research these dead beetles and found out that the beetle 's shield contains a polymer called chitin , a type of natural plastic			2
the @entity16 scientist uses the material , which took her six months to develop , to make laps and jewellery ( pictured ) but says she is still in the research phases ‘ i peel the dead beetles to get the shells off them			1
’ ms @entity5 said that while the insect plastic shows the recipe she uses works , she is still in the research phase			1
‘ i use this bioplastic for light objects and jewellery , but in future i want to use it for the non-biodegradable plastics , ’ she said			0
‘ my next step is to research the properties of the material , so i know where i can use the material for			0
‘ the benefits of this material is that it 's biodegradable and made of waste material			0
‘ my hope is that it could become a replacement for normal plastic			0
