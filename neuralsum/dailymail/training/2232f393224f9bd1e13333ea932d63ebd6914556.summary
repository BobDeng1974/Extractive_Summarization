@entity0 offers his observations from the @entity2			0
this time the former @entity4 batsman talks free trams , @entity7 's strange dinner date and @entity4 's expectations			2
co-hosts with the most i ’ve been here a long time already working on the @entity12 and the tri-series and i can tell you that @entity15 are an awesome side			1
i ’ve been camped up in the fantastic city of @entity18 for the past two weeks where one of the attractions is that the trams are free ( in the city centre ) - which i ’m sure will appeal to @entity24 ... @entity15 , here celebrating a wicket in their final warm - up against @entity28 , look to be an awesome side @entity18 's trams are free of charge in the city centre , a cost @entity30 says appeals to @entity24 @entity36 is batty bumped into @entity7 - who led @entity15 so well during @entity39 ’s absence in their recent @entity41 series against @entity42 - in a restaurant with his partner and would you believe he had his bat with him ? he almost left it behind ! i nearly took it but eventually called out to his young lady : ‘ he ’s left his bat ! ’ @entity53 seem to take their bats everywhere			1
run machine @entity7 has such a close connection to his bat that he takes it out for dinner come on @entity4 ! what about @entity4 ? they ’re not favourites but they are working their nuts off and reaching the semi-final would be a good effort			1
in their last game , against @entity66 , they hit only 250			0
but all i can say is : ‘ come on @entity4 ! and @entity68 and @entity69 , too			0
’ @entity70 's @entity4 are n't favourites and it would be an achievement to reach the last four			0

@entity2 co-hosts @entity15 are an awesome side
the @entity53 ' stand - in test *skipper* @entity7 loves his bats
for @entity4 to make the semi-final would be a good result
