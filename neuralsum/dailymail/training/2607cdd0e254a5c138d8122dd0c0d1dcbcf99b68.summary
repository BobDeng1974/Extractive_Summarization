as @entity1 chimed and we celebrated – or mourned – the passing of deadline day at 11pm , the transfer window , as it does , slammed shut			1
only , it did n’t			0
in fact , it remained wedged open for another two hours			0
that was long enough for @entity11 ’s @entity10 to dive head first through the opening at @entity14 , and @entity15 to slip underneath the frame at @entity17			1
domestic transfers , however , can be granted an extension until 1am , and international transfers until midnight			0
we ’re going to need more than that , so can you just sign a player at 11.30pm ? no – a ‘ deal sheet ’ must be submitted to the @entity44 before 11pm			0
so , in effect , that is still the deadline for all parties agreeing to a transfer and putting their approval to a sheet which says it is going to happen			2
if the @entity44 has this by 11pm then they will grant an extension to finalise all other paperwork			2
so no , @entity57 can not decide at 11.30pm that he still needs a centre - back and start ringing around			0
he should have done that at 1.30pm … had @entity60 gone to bed ? @entity15 poses with @entity32 assistant manager @entity62 what else needs to be finalised ? the ‘ deal sheet ’ is an emergency measure which can only be used after 9pm and no later than 11pm			1
after that documents such as the contract , the transfer agreement and permission to work in the @entity70 must be submitted			0
the deal sheet : the vital piece of paperwork clubs need to complete before 11pm why do domestic transfers get an extra hour extra compared with international deals ? the @entity44 allows two hours – that is their decision – but international transfers must comply with the @entity79 ( @entity80 ) deadline of midnight			1
what is that ? @entity79 ’s @entity80 is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance			1
late show : @entity10 ( right ) was spotted in discussions with @entity14 well after the 11pm deadline so what did happen with @entity15 and @entity10 ? @entity15 was a little different to @entity10 in that his deal had been agreed earlier in the day and it just took a little time to complete his medical and other formalities before a belated announcement			1
but @entity10 was your classic deadline - day dash			1
we were being kept up - to - speed on the move throughout and there was a little concern at one stage that the extension would pass without all paperwork being submitted			0
@entity10 left @entity108 at around 7.30pm – taking in the @entity109 and a traffic jam in @entity111			2
meanwhile , a ‘ deal sheet ’ was being faxed to the @entity44 and that allowed the extra two hours to agree the terms of the season - long loan deal once @entity10 had finally arrived at @entity14 ’s training ground			1
roaring success : @entity14 showed off their new boy well after midnight as @entity10 posed with a shirt and what about @entity121 at @entity32 ? @entity121 ’s £ 16m move from @entity123 is complete , at least from a footballing perspective			1
he was given an international certificate by the @entity126 and arrived in @entity127 last week on a tourist visa to finalise the deal			2
but that is where the problem lies			0
immigration laws require that those entering the country to work do so with a working visa			0
and embassy officials will first look into details of an alleged altercation with a neighbour in @entity141 in 2010 before issuing the working visa , as the incident is still being investigated by police			0
we 're still waiting : @entity121 ( left ) joined @entity32 over a week ago but his visa is still not finalised so @entity121 should be ok , but what happened with @entity148 ’s @entity147 at @entity149 ? the @entity151 striker was set to join the @entity152 on loan and had travelled to @entity154 to complete the deal			1
but the move collapsed just after midnight with both @entity14 and @entity149 having failed to allow the @entity157 the time needed to process the transfer			1
there is , however , the possibility of the @entity157 appealing to @entity79 over the circumstances of the delay			2
too late : @entity147 leaves @entity164 after talks with the club , but his move was not completed so after all of that , should the deadline not just be 11pm on ‘ deadline day ’ ? the fact that some deals can be completed the following day ( i.e. after midnight ) does n’t seem right			1
certainly , @entity174 chairman @entity173 thinks so , tweeting his agreement with the statement : ‘ am i the only one that thinks there should not be extensions … there is a deadline for a reason ’			0
take that up with the @entity44 , @entity173			0
in the meantime , you know where to come for any deadline - day queries …			2

*summer* transfer window ended at 11pm on ' deadline day '
but @entity15 joined @entity32 after the deadline
@entity10 also completed loan to @entity14 after 11pm
yet @entity147 loan to @entity149 collapsed after midnight
@entity126 and @entity79 *rules* allow transfer paperwork to be completed after deadline
