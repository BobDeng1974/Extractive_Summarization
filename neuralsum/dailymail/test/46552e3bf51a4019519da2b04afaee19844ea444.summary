until now , @entity0 has been best known as the long - haired hipster who finally tamed @entity3			1
yet this year it looks as though the 29 - year - old actor , who counts @entity6 and @entity7 among his best friends , could be set to become more famous than his a-list fiancee			1
not only is the @entity11 - born actor wowing the @entity12 in @entity13 , he 's about to step into the costume drama void left by @entity16 's @entity15 , when he plays sergeant @entity17 to @entity20 's @entity19 in the hotly - anticipated new adaptation of @entity22			1
however up until now it was his relationship with @entity3 - which began in march 2011 - which had everyone talking			1
those who have met the actor say he is shy and reserved - a far cry from @entity42 's previous conquests @entity43 and @entity44			2
but despite his laid back demeanor @entity0 - described by @entity46 as ' handsome , but also quirky and charming - is slowly but surely making a name for himself as a talented young actor			1
his first big film break came in 2013 when he starred in the movie adaptation of @entity51 's @entity52 alongside @entity53 and @entity54			1
and he is currently treading the boards in the @entity12 , starring alongside @entity56 and @entity57 in the @entity58 play @entity13 which opened this month			1
and later this year he will feature alongside @entity28 , @entity59 and @entity60 in the new film @entity61			2
@entity42 and @entity0 have been dating since 2011 , the pair got together in 2011 shortly after she split from the actor @entity43 for a second time however he says he is careful not to spread himself to thin when it comes to his work : ' i choose carefully , ' he said , ' i 'm not afraid of not working			1
' and it is this slow and steady approach that seems to be making him the critics ' favourite			1
in 2013 when he starred in the @entity72 play orphans he was nominated for a prestigious @entity73			0
the reviewer for the @entity75 , @entity76 , singled out @entity0 's ' killer @entity72 debut ' performance , writing : ' he shows astonishing athleticism and expressive physicality , leaping from one surface to another with simian agility or shrinking into a huddled ball			1
' but he also conveys the alert mind ticking away behind the stuttering words and the twitchy , obsessive behaviour			0
' there 's a distinct sense here of a docile but unpredictable caged animal , literally about to burst with pent - up energy			2
' @entity0 counts @entity7 ( left ) and @entity6 ( right ) among his close friends in 2012 @entity0 starred alongside @entity6 's then on / off girlfriend @entity53 and is thought to have been close friends with the actress but his sheer talent and growing reputation may come as a surprise to those who knew @entity0 growing up , as unlike many of his peers , he never planned to be an actor			1
born into a thespian family - his father @entity105 directed the original @entity108 series as well as @entity109 , and his mother is actress @entity0 told @entity112 : ' as children , my siblings and i were actively discouraged from acting			1
i have no memories of going on set with my parents – aside from @entity119			0
' his father cast him in the tv special starring @entity123 because he wanted a child actor he could talk to			0
the actor remembered : ' all i remember is occasionally having conversations with my father and then someone filming me			0
' but he began to rebel against the acting world he knew so well and struggled with life at the elite £ 13,500 - a - year @entity133 in west @entity11 ( where he met best friend @entity6 )			1
he said : ' i left school early in my last year before i took my a-levels			0
it was just a mutual understanding			0
i was n't interested in going to school and they said , " you 're not turning up " , so we severed ties			0
' that rebellious streak certainly shows up in his distinctive scruffy , trendy style - his penchant for skinny jeans , pork pie hats , lumberjack shirts and skinny ties - and earned him the notice of fashion house @entity155 who cast @entity0 and his fiancee @entity42 in a moody black and white ad together			1
@entity42 and @entity0 got together in 2011 , not long after she split from @entity43 for the second time			2
the pair became engaged soon after and they welcomed their daughter @entity162 on july 7 , 2012			1
@entity42 says that being with @entity0 and having their daughter @entity162 - born in 2012 - has changed her life although discreet about their life together , the short clip filmed by @entity166 provided a touching insight into the couple 's strong bond as they flirted , laughed , gazed into each others ' eyes and kissed passionately			1
creative director @entity175 said : ' this was a shoot full of love and laughter			0
it was such a treat to work with @entity42 and @entity0 , and to capture their magic together			1
' that ' magic ' is something @entity42 is profoundly grateful for			0
in december , the 33 - year - old told @entity185 : ' @entity0 is a grounded , intelligent , kind , and intact person			2
that 's amazing to be around			2
that 's the father of my child			2
' of having their daughter @entity162 in july 2012 she said : ' i was overwhelmed by how normal it felt			1
it was like , " there you are - that 's what i have been missing "			2
' like we 're both in on something only we know			0
an amazing sense of being complicit with a little being			0
' @entity0 attended the 2015 @entity206 @entity205 party with his fiance @entity42 and his best friend @entity6 today the pair are one of the most sought - after on the party circuit but keeping their life low - key is a priority			1
@entity42 said : ' we go to the country			0
i like to cook and go to @entity217			0
i have a [ @entity219 ] dog - not a dog but a bear - who when i walk pulls me over flat on my face into the mud			0
' my baby pukes on me			0
it 's very much a normal life			0
i really do n't want to sound boring			0
it 's completely crazy and illicit behind closed doors			0
' in a 2009 interview @entity0 revealed that he carried a private journal everywhere with him in which he wrote stories and musings			2
he said : ' i write constantly , about everything			0
' now as @entity0 prepares for big screen stardom , the question now is not whether he has enough to jot into his diary , but whether he has the time .			2

@entity0 , 29 , will star in @entity13 alongside @entity56
he is fast becoming a critics ' favourite but is picky about his work
engaged to @entity3 , the mother of daughter @entity162
born into an acting family , he 's best friends with @entity6
