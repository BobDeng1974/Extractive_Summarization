' it 's all pickled and nice and ready to be displayed , ' @entity8 said			1
' there are over a thousand artifacts			0
we did our homework and this find is invaluable because it all belonged to the king			0
it is a fabulous window into the 1820s			0
' @entity8 said the king 's belongings were buried in 10 feet of water and 10 feet of sand			1
his favorite discovery was a trumpet shell			1
' i found it under a bunch of sand and carried it onto the deck			0
i blew it and it made the most beautiful sound going out over @entity89 , ' @entity8 recalled			1
' i thought about how it had n't been blown in over 170 years			0
' @entity14 purchased the yacht from @entity92 , who named it ' @entity94 ' in 1816			1

at the center is the royal pu , or conch horn			0
around it are ulu maika game stones , pounders , canoe breakers , and a stone rubber @entity97 said reports were conflicting about the condition of the crew of the 83 - foot long ship , which had been renamed @entity117 ? aheo o @entity119 ? i ( ' @entity44 ' )			0
some documents indicate everyone on board was drunk april 6 , 1824 , when the ship went aground on a shallow reef			1
other historical accounts report everyone was intoxicated except the captain			0
the cause of the wreck is unfounded but speculation shows it may have been the combination of an unexpected wind gale and a snapped anchor cable			0
there are no reports that anyone died aboard the ship , which was crewed entirely by @entity136			0
the principal value of the artifacts is historical , said @entity139 , @entity140 , curator of @entity141 at the @entity142			0

precious : pictured here is a gunpowder flask found in the wreckage of a ship belonging to @entity14 ' he only reigned from 1819 -1824 , but @entity1 changed forever and irrevocably from the changes he put into place during that short period			1
he was an important member of our nation 's only authentic royalty , ' @entity139 said			0
the @entity119 owns the artifacts and loaned them to the @entity11 for conservation and study			2
@entity168 he findings were in the custody of the @entity11 from the time of their recovery , with the exception of some artifacts going to the @entity176 at @entity177			2
