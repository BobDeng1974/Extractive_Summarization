caretakers of @entity2 's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in @entity5 and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site , even as they commemorate the 150th anniversary of the @entity12 president 's assassination			1
for the state that calls itself the ' @entity19 , ' the timing of a ceremony wednesday in @entity15 to mark his death is awkward because @entity19 faces a financial crisis and gov. @entity21 has proposed eliminating the state @entity22 that manages sites including the tomb as it currently exists			1
he would roll the agency into another department			2
what 's more , the popular tourist site was pilloried in this month 's issue of @entity5 as having ' all the historical character of an office lobby			1
' landmark : in this feb. 12 , 2015 file photo , @entity19 gov. @entity21 participates in ceremonies honoring president @entity2 at the @entity2 tomb in @entity15 , @entity19 leader : a marker is seen over the burial site of @entity2 inside @entity2 's tomb within @entity42 ( november 2013 file photo ) killing : president @entity2 was assassinated by @entity45 at a performance of the play ' @entity48 ' in april 1865 recounting the route of @entity2 's funeral train to @entity15 for burial , historian @entity49 describes the tomb as ' a disappointment ' and reconstructed in ' incongruous @entity56 style			1
' ' it 's strange to think that there is a place where @entity2 still physically exists in the world , let alone that it 's a place like this , ' writes @entity49 , who is director for @entity62 for the @entity63 in @entity64			2
@entity49 's publicist did n't immediately return a request for comment			0
the hours and days the @entity2 tomb is open have been reduced , and it 's staffed with fewer employees since state lawmakers last year cut $ 1.1 million funding for sites in the @entity15 area			2
on tuesday — the 150th anniversary of @entity45 's shooting of @entity2 , although the president was pronounced dead the following day — @entity79 and a group of former bridge club friends found the tomb 's iron door locked , despite a sign saying the site should be open at that time			1
@entity86 , spokesman for the @entity22 , said the correct times when the site is open are posted on its website			2
@entity89 , president of the @entity90 , said she 's deeply concerned about what more cuts might mean for the @entity2 site			2
' we 're all scared to death , ' said @entity89 , who also serves as a volunteer tour guide			0
' we do n't know how things are going to be run			0
' she and other supporters of how @entity2 's final resting place is presented to the public said the @entity5 portrayal was unfair			1
remembered : tourists walk out of @entity2 's tomb and past a bust of @entity2 statue ( november 2013 file photo ) shrouded in history : caretakers of @entity2 's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering critique in @entity5 and looming budget cuts that could threaten management of the historic site ( february 2014 file photo ) ' the author of the piece is certainly entitled to feel underwhelmed by the tomb 's interior , but i think it 's safe to say he 's in the minority , ' @entity86 said			1
according to the @entity125 , the tomb and its receiving vault have seen more than $ 2.5 million in recent repairs and renovations , leaving it in what @entity86 describes as ' excellent physical condition			0
' the tomb 's interior plaster and paint , and bronze and marble construction were renovated last year , and its interior lighting was upgraded for approximately $ 730,000			0
the state is currently working on waterproofing the receiving vault , repairing the stone structure 's interior , and landscaping to direct water away from the vault , a roughly $ 390,000 project			0
@entity2 's tomb was designed by @entity146 sculptor @entity145 , who won a national contest			1
it was dedicated by president @entity149 in 1874			1
originally built on what historians describe as an ' inadequate foundation , ' it was reconstructed first in 1899 , and then again in 1930 to give the public access to the interior burial chamber			0
today , the tomb , a circular structure topped with an obelisk , has its interior sheathed in alternating black and tan marble and is trimmed with bronze			0
hallways stretch on either side of a rotunda to the family burial chamber , where @entity2 lies below an inscription ' now he belongs to the ages			0
' @entity168 , a visitor to the outside of the tomb tuesday who took an @entity173 train from @entity174 , @entity175 , said he had a copy of the @entity5 story with him at his @entity15 hotel , but disagreed with its conclusion			0
' it 's absolutely gorgeous , ' he said of the site , even though he did n't get to see the interior of the tomb			0
