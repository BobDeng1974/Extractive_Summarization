by @entity0 a beautiful @entity2 glen which featured in the @entity4 film @entity3 is being blighted by fly - tippers and litter louts			1
tents , mattresses , and pile upon pile of rubbish is left strewn around @entity12 , in @entity13 , in the @entity14			1
residents are cataloguing the problem with a series of pictures showing the mess left by climbers and campers along the 14 - mile glen to the head of @entity24			1
it featured in the 2012 @entity4 blockbuster @entity3 , starring @entity27 and @entity28 , and also in two @entity30 films , the @entity31 and @entity32			1
the breathtaking scenery featured in 007 movie @entity3 is being ' destroyed ' by fly - tippers and litter louts residents are cataloguing the problem with a series of pictures showing the mess left by climbers and campers at @entity12 , in @entity13 , in the @entity14 the stunning scenery and locations along the 14 - mile glen to the head of @entity24 featured in the 2012 @entity4 blockbuster @entity3 , starring @entity27 and dame @entity28 the glen also attracts huge numbers of ' wild ' campers each year , who leave behind full campsites , prompting the launch of a @entity50 campaign			1
@entity51 and @entity52 who have lived in the glen for the past two years , set up a @entity50 community page called ' @entity12 - @entity55 ' to document the behaviour of some campers and day - trippers who drive away leaving bags full of rubbish , tents , camping equipment , broken bottles , drinks cans and - in some instances - drugs paraphernalia			1
mr @entity65 , 29 , said : ' it 's just baffling the mentality of these people , who show no respect for such a gorgeous part of the country			2
the area was also used in two @entity30 films , @entity74 1 and @entity32 the glen attracts huge numbers of campers each year , many of whom leave behind vast amounts of litter @entity51 and @entity52 who have lived in the glen for the past two years , set up a @entity50 community page called ' @entity12 - @entity55 ' to document and expose the selfish behaviour of some campers and day - trippers ' it 's the festival mentality that some people seem to have , rocking up on a friday and partying all weekend			1
we see whole campsites left - tents full of dirty nappies			1
there 's broken bottles and even supermarket trolleys which appear to be used for cooking food on the fire			2
' the @entity95 set up the @entity50 page just two weeks ago and have been amazed at the positive response , with 1,347 likes so far			1
' the facebook page has sparked a good debate and discussion about what the possible solutions might be			1
there have been just one or two negative comments but that is probably from people just looking for an argument , " @entity51 said			2
" we do n't want people to stop coming here , we just want people to respect the place and not trash it , because it is just sickening what is happening			0
' there are signs in the glen telling people to take their litter home yet i find black bags full of rubbish piled up under them			1
there is no logic to it ! ' he added : ' maybe we need to take a leaf out of the @entity129 ' book and have dedicated countryside police or wardens who patrol our glens and could tackle the problem head on			0
i do challenge people but sometimes you have to step back if it 's 10 against one			0
' it seems that people just do n't care			0
it can be all sorts of people too - i 've seen people draw up in @entity141 , and i think they surely wo n't leave rubbish , but they do			1
there 's no way of telling who are going to be the messy ones			0
' mr @entity65 said the constant mess means he is now considering moving away from the area			2
the couple said some campers drive away leaving bags full of rubbish , tents , camping equipment , broken bottles , drinks cans and - in some instances - drugs paraphernalia the couple said some people left full campsites behind , complete with tents and bedding the couple said that trolleys were often abandoned at the site , and had appeared to be used to cook food on fires local @entity169 councillor @entity168 has called for a meeting between the various landowners , public bodies and police in a bid to tackle the on - going problem of fly - tipping in @entity12			1
he said : ' i am angered that such a beautiful glen might as well be renamed ' @entity179 ' because of the lazy and selfish actions of those who think it acceptable to simply drive away , leaving their mess behind			2
' this is n't real wild camping			0
what is wild about leaving your car blocking a passing place , emptying the entire contents of its boot and carrying it less than a hundred metres from the road side ? the only thing that is wild about this camping , is how it leaves me and many others feeling when we see how the glen is being destroyed			0
there 's no doubt , it has got even worse since the ban on camping around @entity203 was introduced			0
' practical action is needed , that 's why i have asked for an urgent meeting with the various landowners , public bodies and police			0
that meeting should take place in the very near future			0
' i 've been in touch with councillors in @entity214 and @entity215 , who have experienced similar problems around @entity217			0
they solved the problem with a proactive approach , which included police patrols , the recording of number plates and the direct threat of prosecution			0
we also need to consider what would happen if camping was banned within a set distance from the road			2
' the northern half of @entity12 is tidied up regularly by landowners , the @entity233 ( @entity233 )			1
a @entity233 spokesperson said : ' this is undoubtedly an issue for us			0
we share concerns about the mess left behind by irresponsible campers in @entity12			1
the @entity233 takes responsibility for tidying up our land - every year we remove hundreds of bags of rubbish			2
this work , while clearly vital , diverts staff from important conservation work in the area			0
it also leaves our charity with the costs for disposing of this rubbish			2
' she added : ' over the years , we have tried various approaches to tackle the issue and to try to encourage responsible behaviour and , of course , we talk regularly to our neighbours and relevant agencies about how best to tackle this			0
however , there are no straightforward solutions			0
