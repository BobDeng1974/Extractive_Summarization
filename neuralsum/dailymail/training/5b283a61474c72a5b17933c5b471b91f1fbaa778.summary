an eager and diligent student forever searching for ways to improve his game , @entity1 has turned to a few different mentors in his time ; be it @entity8 at @entity9 or @entity10 in the @entity12 squad , the callow young second row has been blessed to be taken under the wing of hardened veterans			1
when it comes to an inspirational role model , though , @entity1 makes no apologies for stating the blooming obvious when he singles out older brother @entity19 as the person most responsible for lighting the path to international rugby			1
not 21 for another month , the younger of the instantly recognisable brothers will win only his 10th cap when he plays against @entity25 on sunday , almost certainly partnering his sibling in the middle of the pack			1
@entity12 lock @entity1 ( right ) puts in a strong tackle on @entity31 winger @entity30 in @entity32 while big bro @entity19 , now 25 and homing in on a half century of caps , may stand a few inches taller , it 's the kid who calls the line - outs			1
the youngster who appears driven to emulate — and maybe even surpass ? — the achievements of the elder			0
' @entity42 , for me , is the biggest role model i 've had growing up , ' said @entity1			1
' it 's just great to have a guy like that by my side			1
' it 's still pretty surreal to be playing together for @entity12			1
and it 's hard to describe			2
just to be involved in the set - up is a special feeling — but to have him here as well , it 's incredible			2
it 's something i never thought would happen			2
' just growing up watching @entity42 , i 've been lucky to have him there and to see first - hand how hard he had to work to get where he is			0
@entity1 lines up @entity31 loosehead @entity58 during his mammoth shift at the @entity60 ' his diet , his extras , his training			1
for me to see that first - hand , there were no excuses for me			0
' and he 's the same here , still out doing his extras , still out there working hard			2
so that 's a great example and to have someone like that around is amazing			2
' asked if he thought his own rise through the ranks may even be providing a spur for @entity19 to work even harder , @entity1 insisted : ' no. i think @entity42 is a top - class player			1
i 'm always learning from him			0
' but throughout the team there is a great team spirit , the work in training that everyone does for each other is great , everyone working to help each other			0
' i 've been very lucky to work with @entity10			1
he 's like @entity8 at @entity9 for me , great to sit down and talk with , share his experiences at line - outs and in other areas			1
@entity1 ( left ) lines up to sing the @entity12 national anthem alongside older brother @entity19 in november ' there are examples of that throughout the squad			1
to have someone like that for me is amazing			0
' now , if young @entity1 ever starts to speak with the effusive sense of adventure he brings to his on - field performances , he 'll be guaranteed a good living on the lecture circuit ; @entity100 — the one in @entity101 , rather than @entity102 — would await any talker able to convey the kind of excitement generated by his rampaging playing style			2
at the moment , though , nearly everything @entity1 says seems determinedly downbeat , his bland answers to even the most gently inviting questions suggesting either an overload of pr training — or some worrying early signs of concussion			2
@entity116 in his prime , he ai n't			0
fortunately , none of that matters once he crosses the white line			0
the fact that he either can not or will not go into detail about @entity12 's plans for the @entity124 , even turning the subject of the visitors ' apparent weakness in the line - out into words of praise for their efficacy at that particular set - piece , is neither here nor there			1
@entity1 drives forward with ball in hand as @entity12 pushed @entity31 all the way before losing 15 - 8 he is n't paid to share tactical insights , does n't pull on the jersey for a chance to get all touchy - feely			1
unless by that you mean getting hold of an opponent and feeling the will drain out of him — just ask @entity30 … so yes , there has been work done on stopping the driving maul that @entity31 used to such good effect last week			0
and no , there is n't anyone in the @entity12 camp who believes @entity25 are the least bit predictable			1
' when you look at @entity25 , their games in the autumn and then against @entity155 last week , you can see how direct they are , ' said @entity1			1
' they 're very physical , they 're tough around the breakdown and they 've got dangerous runners throughout the team			0
so we know how hard the game is going to be			0
' the team spirit here is very strong			0
we go into every game thinking we can win			2
but we know how tough it 's going to be			0
it 's going to be a massive challenge			0
wales are going to be hurting after their loss to @entity155 , so we need to prepare as best we can			0
we 've looked at the @entity31 game and , ultimately , we 're disappointed we did n't get the result			0
' there are a lot of positives to take but , at the same time , a lot of improvements need to be made			0
' we know how dangerous @entity25 are going to be this week so we need to get our preparations right going into that			2
' with that , @entity1 retired to — for all we may know — eat a whole cow , perform a couple of thousand press - ups , do an extra hour of core work and start kicking down solid oak doors by way of preparation for welcoming the @entity124			1
sounds daft ? if @entity19 started doing any or all of the above , you can be sure that @entity1 would follow suit			1
why change a winning formula , right ?			0

@entity1 will win his 10th cap against @entity25 on sunday
@entity1 and his brother @entity19 have formed a solid second row paring for @entity199 's new look @entity12 side
