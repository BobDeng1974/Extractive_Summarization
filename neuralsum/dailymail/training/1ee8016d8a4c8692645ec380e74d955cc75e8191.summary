by @entity0 published : 05:02 est , 29 august 2012 updated : 08:52 est , 29 august 2012 a flight attendant has landed in the @entity3 book after spending an incredible 63 years in the sky			1
@entity5 , 83 , the longest - serving air steward in aviation history , worked his final flight from @entity8 to @entity9 , last weekend ending his amazing career in the state where it began			1
@entity13 , however , was n't his final stop			1
his destination now is retirement in @entity17 , @entity18 , where he has been living since 2002 to be closer to his grandchildren			2
flight attendant @entity5 , 83 , has landed a place in the @entity3 after spending 63 years in the sky mr @entity5 has spent his first few days of retirement writing thank - you notes to well - wishers			1
' i was n't expecting this much attention , ' he said			2
he joined the airline while a student at the @entity30 in 1949 , when friends spotted a newspaper ad - one of 400 applying for only eight spots			2
' we did n't even know what a flight steward was , ' he recalled			1
' but it meant getting to the mainland , which was a huge deal in those days			2
' it seemed pretty exciting and it proved to be more than that			2
' @entity43 became one of @entity46 's first male flight attendants			1
" ' we just liked working with girls , ' he said			0
when mr @entity5 started , all of the seats were similar to those of today 's first class cabin			1
many of the planes had bars , smoke filled the cabin air , and passengers moved about freely , often using a circular staircase to go between floors			1
he had to put his career on hold for two years when he was drafted in 1951 during the @entity64			2
@entity5 said his most memorable moments included meeting the cast of the 1953 movie ' @entity68 , ' service with a smile : jovial @entity5 greets guests aboard a flight at @entity74 high flyers : on one trip , mr @entity5 served the entire cast of the film @entity68 , including @entity79 ( left ) , @entity80 ( center ) and @entity82 ( right ) the 1953 @entity84 - winning film , which starred @entity82 , @entity80 and @entity85 , was set in @entity13 so he rubbed elbows with the stars on one of their flights			1
' i made her bed in the stateroom			0
that was exciting , ' he told the @entity95 about the trip			0
' @entity80 had 12 or 13 martinis , then came and bartended with me as if he had nâ€™t had one , ' he recalls			0
over the years , he 's seen it all			2
passengers would dress up , not down			0
think suits , not flip - flops			0
smoking was no big deal , not a federal offense			0
over time , though , things changed			0
the meal service became better			0
in - flight movies , which he said started to be shown seven or eight years after he began his career			1
and , of course , tight security after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks			0
home away from home : mr @entity5 met his wife when she worked as a flight attendant , and his daughter has now been working as a flight attendant for 22 years @entity3 came calling a few months ago and later sent him a plaque recognizing him as the longest - serving flight attendant			1
he 's been told he 'll appear in the record book in october			0
to get a sense of how long he 's been in the air , consider that if his 200 million miles counted toward @entity46 's frequent flyer program , he could treat the entire town of @entity126 , @entity127 , population 1,138 , to a first class trip from @entity130 to @entity131 and back - then once a month for the next 12 years , he 'd still have enough miles to travel with his wife , @entity133 , anywhere they want in the continental @entity134 their daughter @entity135 followed in her parents footsteps as well , and has now worked 22 - years as a flight attendant for @entity46 , which recently merged and is now known as @entity139			1

' i shall have to watch from the sidelines , ' he said			0
while he 's now retired , @entity5 is not done flying			1
from now on , his wife will be joining him			0
' i got terrific travel privileges , ' he said , adding : ' there 's a lot to be seen			0
