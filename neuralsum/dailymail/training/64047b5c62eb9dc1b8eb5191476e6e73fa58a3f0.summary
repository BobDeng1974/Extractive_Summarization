@entity1 ceo @entity0 announces that the search giant has concluded a $ 12.5 billion deal to buy @entity4 , a key manufacturer of smartphones and other devices @entity1 completed its $ 12.5 billion acquisition of phone maker @entity4 - and immediately appointed a senior @entity1 exec as ceo			1
@entity1 is widely expected to use the acquisition to produce further phones and tablets running its @entity13 software - including @entity1 - branded rivals to @entity17 's @entity16			1
@entity18 , previously president of @entity1 's @entity20 region , is @entity4 's new ceo			1
it is @entity1 's largest acquisition ever , and pushes it deeper into the phone market			1
@entity1 ceo @entity0 said , ' many users coming online today may never use a desktop machine , and the impact of that transition will be profound			1
' besides producing smartphones and tablet computers , @entity4 also makes cable - tv boxes that could provide @entity1 with a springboard for delivering more of its services , including advertising , to living rooms in the form of a revamped version of its @entity37 service			1
@entity39 analyst @entity38 believes @entity1 is particularly interested in developing a better tablet computer powered by its @entity13 software to compete against @entity17 's hot - selling @entity16 and @entity43 's @entity42			1
@entity1 is already a formidable force in mobile computing thanks to its @entity13 software , the most popular mobile operating system on @entity48			2
@entity4 's @entity50 tablet : @entity1 is widely expected to use the acquisition to produce further phones and tablets running its @entity13 software - including @entity1 - branded rivals to @entity17 's @entity16 at the same time , the acquisition has been interpreted as largely a defensive one			1
@entity1 needs @entity4 's trove of 17,000 cellphone patents to defend @entity13 phones against lawsuits by @entity17 , which accuses them of copying @entity64 features			2
@entity1 and @entity4 announced the deal last summer , expecting it would close late last year or early this year			2
but approval from @entity68 regulators was slow in coming			0
on saturday , @entity68 approved the deal , on condition that @entity1 's @entity13 software would remain free for other phone makers for at least five years			1
regulators in the @entity73 and @entity74 had cleared the deal three months ago			0
the acquisition will also test @entity1 's ability to keep its business partners , shareholders and employees happy as it moves beyond internet search and other services built on software to begin manufacturing a wide range of equipment for the first time			0
@entity1 executive @entity18 was appointed as the new ceo of @entity4			1
@entity87 is also an @entity88 @entity1 has been reassuring its @entity13 partners that @entity4 's devices wo n't get souped - up versions of the software or receive other preferential treatment			1
although it initially was drawn to @entity4 for its patents , @entity1 has been signaling recently that it has been drawing up more ambitious plans for @entity4			0
the company also will likely have to do some hand - holding with investors who have already been fretting about @entity4 's troubles eroding @entity1 's hefty profit margins			2
as its line of smartphones has waned in popularity , @entity4 has suffered losses totaling $ 1.7 billion during the past three years			0
@entity1 has earned a total of $ 25 billion over the same stretch			0
the contrasting fortunes of the two companies is one reason why ceo @entity0 has decided to operate @entity4 separately so it will be easier for investors to track how the different lines of business are faring			1
turning around @entity4 also will require layoffs , a painful process that belies @entity1 's carefully cultivated image as a cuddly employer			0
@entity1 laid off about 300 people after it paid $ 3.2 billion to acquire online advertising service @entity118 in 2008 , up until the biggest deal in the company 's history			2
the cutbacks represented about one - quarter of the workforce that @entity1 inherited from @entity118			2
if @entity1 imposes a similar reduction on @entity4 's 20,500 - employee payroll , it would translate into about 5,000 layoffs			2
taking on so many new employees also raises the risk of culture clashes with the 33,000 people already working at @entity1			0
@entity4 is one half of the old @entity4 it split at the beginning of last year			0
the other half , @entity136 , is still independent			0
it sells police radios , barcode scanners and other products aimed at government and corporate customers			0
@entity1 shares fell $ 5.69 to $ 608.41 in morning trading tuesday			0
they are still near their 52 - week high of $ 670.25 per share set in early january .			0
