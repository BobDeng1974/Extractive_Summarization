@entity0 is the @entity1 and @entity2 the @entity2			2
so it follows that @entity4 should be the @entity5			2
pitch up at @entity6 – a dance hall in the @entity9 district – at around 10pm , and you need not leave until 4am			2
after just one night , you realise that @entity4 is a city in thrall to tango			1
no wonder @entity16 ’s @entity15 said that the dance had been one of the greatest pleasures of his youth			1
city of lights : @entity4 - which translates loosely as ' @entity23 ' - is an attractive , arty city tango is thought to originate with the @entity26 immigrants who settled in @entity16 during the 19th and early 20th centuries			1
much of the capital ’s architecture is redolent of the @entity30 they left behind : leafy boulevards and @entity34 apartments			1
more than 40,000 @entity35 visit each year , most spending a few days in town before moving west to the pampas or south to @entity38			1
but many are perfectly happy to stay put , dancing by night and exploring by day			2
it helps that the food and drink are sublime			1
brushstrokes and dancing shoes : @entity16 's arty side is visible in the city , with its love of tango always clear beef comes straight from the grasslands and wine from the incomparable @entity54 region			1
just remember not to book dinner at 8pm – unless you want to eat alone			2
restaurants do not fill up until 10pm , and most stay open until 1am			1
the city can also be extraordinarily cheap - with approximately 14 @entity16 pesos to the pound , we found it hard to spend more than £ 20 a head			1
and yet , as we discovered during our week , there is so much more to this exhilarating city than tango and t - bone			1
with art to rival that of any @entity30 capital , @entity4 is one of the world ’s great cultural cities , boasting no fewer than eight impressive galleries			1
remarkably , this wealth of culture is a well - kept secret			1
few outside the art world know that the @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , for example , has an enviable collection of @entity83 and @entity84			1
show - stopper : the famous @entity87 street in the @entity89 district of the city is awash with colour however , with the opening of a new exhibition at @entity96 ’s @entity95 , the secret is out			1
radical @entity97 , a selection of 20th century art from @entity16 , @entity100 and @entity101 , showcases the best @entity103 modern art. you might not be immediately familiar with the names of @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , but you will recognize their debt to modernism and to @entity30 masters such as @entity112 and @entity113			1
with @entity30 in turmoil during and after the @entity115 , @entity4 became a magnet for creative types seeking artistic freedom			2
in @entity121 , the @entity120 regime was persecuting not only @entity122 , but also those who espoused the avant - garde			2
as dr @entity128 , exhibitions curator at the @entity95 , says : “ many artists , many of them @entity122 , crossed the @entity130 to find refuge here , creating an extraordinary dynamism			0
there was an atmosphere of freedom and invention			0
” urban planning on a grand scale : @entity4 boasts the world 's widest avenue , @entity137 9 de @entity138 only @entity0 , home to @entity139 and @entity140 , could rival @entity4 in its post-war artistic energy			2
for anyone thinking of a cultural break , @entity4 offers an alternative to @entity145 or @entity146			0
its museums are delightfully uncrowded , and none of your favourite pictures will ever be out on loan			0
because @entity16 defaulted on its debt repayments in 2001 , none of its national collection can ever leave the country for fear of being impounded			1
so @entity83 ’s magnificent pastel of two dancers , for example , will always be waiting for you			0
the city can rival @entity30 not only in art , but also opera and ballet			1
the great @entity26 tenor @entity165 crossed the @entity130 to perform at its world - famous @entity167 opera house in 1917 , and it continues to attract the finest performers			2
on our last night , we returned to @entity6 , determined to tango to the very end			0
a splendid cityscape : @entity4 has its scruffy corners , but it is a city that never fails to excite having taken a couple of lessons in @entity96 , we felt rather confident : take four steps , pause and flick our heads with a flourish			2
we soon realised that @entity16 tango looks nothing like its rather weedy @entity182 cousin			1
seeing our confusion , a young woman took pity on us			0
‘ it ’s easy , ’ @entity185 breathed , as she held my husband close			0
‘ it ’s just like walking			0
’ under the spell of her @entity194 charms , he glided around the room			0
as for me , left dancing with a stranger , i felt i needed balancing wheels			0
so while he thought ‘ @entity200 ’ , i felt more ‘ @entity201 ’			0
miraculously , we managed one circuit of the ballroom			0
a small triumph , but one large enough to convince us that we must return soon			0
but next time , we will pack our dancing shoes			0
@entity208 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity4 from @entity209 from £ 808 return			0
rooms at the @entity212 ( 0054 11 5217 5799 , www.esplendorpalermosoho.com ) start at £ 50 , with breakfast			0
for more information on @entity4 see www.turismo.gov.ar			0
‘ @entity97 of @entity103 from the @entity216 ’ runs at the @entity95 ( 020 7300 8000 , www.royalacademy.org.uk ) until 28 september .			0

@entity16 's capital is a haven for art lovers , with a selection of top galleries
best paintings are always in town , because of country 's international debts
city restaurants offer fine food - but the *exchange* rate makes them cheap
