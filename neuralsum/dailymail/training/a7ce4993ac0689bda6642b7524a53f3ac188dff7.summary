by @entity0 a groundbreaking satellite that changes the way we see the world has been launched			2
called @entity6 , it launched from @entity7 on 3 april and soon after mission controllers confirmed they had made contact with the craft , to cheering in the control room			1
it is the first of a pair of satellites to launch into space , with the second - called @entity16 - due to launch in 2015			0
the pair is the first of the new @entity20 family of satellites that will map our planet like never before			1
their mission will be to monitor the @entity38 and track changes in its climate @entity41 is a polar - orbiting , all - weather , day - and - night radar imaging mission for land and ocean services			1
@entity46 is a high - resolution imaging mission that will provide imagery of vegetation , soil and water cover			1
sentinel - 3 is a multi-instrument mission to measure sea - surface topography , sea and land - surface temperature , ocean colour and land colour			0
@entity59 will be devoted to atmospheric @entity60 will monitor the atmosphere from polar orbit			0
@entity63 carries a radar altimeter to measure global sea - surface height , primarily for operational oceanography and for climate studies			1
sentinel 1 - a launched on a @entity26 rocket from @entity28 's @entity27 and will be placed into an @entity38 orbit between an altitude of 150 and 250 miles ( 250 and 400km )			0
using radar imagery , it will soon begin mapping the surface of @entity38			1
countries across @entity28 have spent â ‚ ¬ 7.5bn ( Â £ 6.2bn ; $ 10.3bn ) on the project that will run until the end of the decade			0
its sensitivity will allow it to detect changes in the climate - particularly those caused by human interference			2
this will complement @entity34 's existing @entity87 service , the goal of which is to respond to environmental and societal challenges associated with climate variability			1
@entity93 family of satellites will give scientists the data they need to determine the current state of our planet			1
it will also enable scientists to continue to fine - tune their predictions of @entity38 's future			0
the overwhelming scientific consensus is that our climate will be damaged beyond repair if humanity does not stop harming the environment			0
@entity6 will be able to observe @entity38 both day and night , and in any weather conditions - a first for observation satellites			1
sentinel 1 - a is launching on a @entity26 rocket from @entity28 's @entity27			0
@entity114 is pictured being transferred from the preparation building to the @entity26 launch zone in @entity7 on 31 march this means that during disasters , including floods and earthquakes , the satellite could help provide support and relief for those on the ground			1
' @entity6 is using radar waves to image @entity38 's surface , ' mission scientist @entity126 told @entity130			1
' it can penetrate through clouds and map @entity38 , so in the case of flooding this ability is important and it can generate maps of areas that are flooded			0
' it can recognise , quite accurately , the difference between water and non-water			0
' the 1 - a , artist 's impression pictured , will be the first of six satellites from @entity34 's new @entity20 family that will map and monitor @entity38 in unprecedented detail the @entity6 satellite , artist 's impression pictured , will orbit @entity38 at an altitude of 150 and 250 miles ( 250 to 400km ) climate studies and disaster relief are n't the only uses for the satellite			1
its exceptional level of accuracy means it can also provide information on miniscule details on @entity38 's surface			2
from its orbit it is able to detect changes on @entity38 down to just a few millimetres			0
this means it could theoretically predict when a building will collapse , detect emerging sinkholes in the ground , or study volcanic activity			1
@entity93 satellite should allow scientists to develop a forecast system for all volcanoes , including those that are remote and inaccessible			2
the satellite will give a view of volcanoes and find the link between ground deformation and eruption			0
@entity182 will launch in 18 months and together the pair will map the entire @entity38 using radar imagery it can also track the world 's shipping lanes , something that has not yet been done by any satellite in @entity38 orbit			1
' with hazards , such as sinkholes developing , we will be able to look where there will be structural damage over time , ' continued @entity126			0
' in extreme cases we could predict if a building could collapse or not			2
' a satellite image of @entity198 in @entity199			0
the new satellite should allow more accurate measurements to be made all of the @entity20 satellites are expected to be launched in the next few years , and together they will provide data that could be used for 20 to 30 years , according to @entity126			2
@entity6 is designed to last seven years but @entity126 added that , like a fridge , ' you have a guarantee but i think as a consumer you usually hope it lasts longer			2

first of a new family of @entity34 satellites launches from @entity7
known as @entity6 , it is the first of six satellite groups
using radar imagery , the satellite will observe our planet day and night
the radar images will allow scientists to detect changes in @entity227 *€* *™* s climate
sentinel family will also help *emergency* responses to floods and quakes
the high level of accuracy of the satellite will theoretically allow it to predict when buildings will collapse or detect emerging sinkholes
