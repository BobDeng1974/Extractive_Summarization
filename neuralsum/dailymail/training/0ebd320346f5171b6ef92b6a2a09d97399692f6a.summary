retailers have been accused of craftily overplaying discount claims to draw shoppers in @entity6 saw a record sales high for high street shops and online retailers with many offering discounts of between 50 and 70 per cent , but many had been much less generous than their claims the @entity22 conducted a survey between @entity6 and december 27 , analysing sales at some of the country 's leading retailers including @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity31			1
it found that in many sales categories - including shoes , bags and dresses - less than half were available at the headline discount			1
@entity39 , chief retail adviser to accountancy firm @entity40 told the paper retailers were being very clever , by ' shouting about discounts ' more than they were discounting			0
she said : ' they 're saying " up to 50 per cent off " but it is very much " up to " rather than " 50 per cent off "			0
it is the first time it has been marked as this because retailers are trying to win market share amid thin sales			2
' @entity52 , head of retail at the professional services firm @entity54 , said while retailers wanted to attract customers , they had to cover costs			0
and @entity58 of comparison website @entity57 said shoppers should be careful not to get drawn in to headline discounts without researching to ensure they were getting the best deal			2
in the ' biggest ever half price sale ' at @entity30 , just 21 of 121 pairs of shoes - 17 per cent - were discounted , and just 25 per cent of bags			1
the @entity29 sale offered discounts of up to 50 per cent both online and instore			2
but the survey revealed only 20 of 126 shoes were cut by 50 per cent or more , and just 27 per cent of bags and 46 per cent of dresses were half price			2
at @entity28 , which also advertised up to 50 per cent off , there were more items at 30 per cent off			2
but @entity78 generally offered at least 50 per cent off all the items in the categories and @entity31 also had more than half of items at the headline discount			1
all retailers have insisted they complied with advertising rules and made it clear 50 per cent discounts applied only to selected items			0
@entity5 spending got off to a slow start in early december , but trading improved in the latter part of the month			1
but this year has seen the shortest ever post @entity5 sales			1
tomorrow is expected to see just half the high number of shoppers recorded on thursday , as stock levels fall			1
@entity98 spokesman @entity97 said : ' weekly sales figures drop very dramatically after @entity5 , with a quick tail - off			1
by january , retail spend is half what it is in december			0
' the relentless no - growth sales environment means big difficulties for retailers and there are no signs that will change			0
' @entity111 president @entity110 said : ' retailers have significantly cut back on stock			0
we expect there to have been quite a drop in footfall from saturday			0
' professor @entity118 , director of the @entity119 , said : ' we do n’t think @entity5 sales have ever tailed off this quickly			1
post-christmas sales first happened in the @entity122 years and lasted through january , before moving to late december in the late 1990s			0
' this year , we have sales starting on @entity124 and tailing off days after @entity5 - with key indicators including the greater availability of parking spaces this year compared to previous years			1
' high sales occurred immediately post-christmas - but these were concentrated in a shorter period than usual			1
the survey found at @entity28 , which also advertised up to 50 per cent off , there were more items at 30 per cent off ' in previous years , customers have been enticed to keep on spending money			0
but this year , customers have spent the money they had in mind and they ’re not keeping on spending			0
' sales are falling away and , from what retailers have told us , footfall is expected to be down 50 per cent between december 27 and 31			1
@entity145 may be quite dead			0
' sales were initially high in big cities but only good in smaller cities			2
the retail industry has been saying ‘ it ’s great , it ’s fantastic ’ - but it will be a different story when they add up the figures in january			0
' we expect a fall in retail sales totals to mid-january compared to last year			0
' the @entity158 ( @entity158 ) say to substantiate a 50 per cent sale claim , at least 10 per cent of discounted products must have the discount			2
@entity29 said all reductions were ' clearly marked ' on each product , and @entity30 said it ' far exceeded ' the requirement , with some items reduced by 70 per cent			0
@entity28 said there were ' roughly the same ' number of 50 per cent and 30 per cent discounts .			0

it is also thought to be the shortest ever post @entity5 sales period
