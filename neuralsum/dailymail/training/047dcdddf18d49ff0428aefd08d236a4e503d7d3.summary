by @entity0 a procession of ferocious storms has been lining up across the @entity3 , with three of the most deadly set to hit land			1
a spectacular satellite image this morning revealed an unsettled @entity7 with @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity9 , and @entity10 simultaneously churning up the ocean			1
the image , taken at 00:00 @entity13 ( 1:00 bst ) , shows the storms far from land – but they have since travelled and are about to unleash their force on @entity18 and @entity19			1
the @entity3 hosts a quartet of tropical cyclones - from left to right - @entity8 , @entity9 ( which kept travelling west to become @entity23 ) , @entity9 , and @entity9 ' i ca n't remember the last time when there were four storms of such intensity travelling the @entity3 at the same time , ' @entity24 , a tropical prediction scientist at the @entity26 told @entity32			1
' @entity3 temperatures in the @entity3 are a little bit above average and that has helped storms to strengthen the storms a bit more , ' he added			2
above - normal sea surface temperatures in the far eastern tropical @entity3 have persisted this year - characteristic of an @entity43 event			2
@entity43 refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the @entity49 in the central and eastern @entity3 becomes hotter than usual			0
@entity51 was supposed to weaken as it slowly trudged west across the @entity3			2
it did n't - and now @entity18 is poised to take its first direct hurricane hit in 22 years			1
the image , taken at 00:00 @entity13 ( 1:00 bst ) , shows the storms far from land – but they have since travelled and are about to unleash their force on @entity18 and @entity19 ' what ended up happening is the storm has resurged just enough to keep its hurricane strength , ' said @entity62 , a meteorologist with the @entity63			1
@entity8 - sustained winds are expected to be 85 to 100 mph ( 135 to 160 kph )			1
@entity23 - sustained winds are 160 mph ( 260 kph ) , with some additional strengthening possible			0
@entity65 sustained winds thought to be at 80 mph ( 128 kph ) @entity9 - sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 kph ) are expected			1
mr @entity62 said that means stronger winds , though rainfall estimates of 12 cm to 20 cm in a short time frame remained unchanged			0
' not a major hurricane , but definitely enough to blow things around , ' he said			0
tracking close behind it was @entity9 , which strengthened just after the image was taken into a category 2 storm			0
the @entity63 in @entity78 warned thursday that gusts up to 55 mph could lash the islands , damaging buildings in its path			0
' the physical size in terms of its diameter that you see in the image does n't necessarily tell us how intense it is at the centre , ' said mr @entity24			2
' for instance , @entity91 in the @entity3 is the largest in terms of how size , and @entity23 is one of the most compact but also the strongest			0
' @entity19 is also bracing itself for high waves and heavy rain this weekend , where @entity8 is forecast to make landfall			1
@entity8 will hit @entity100 saturday local time and slam into western @entity101 saturday evening with winds of between 85 to 100 mph			1
@entity8 shown at 00:00 @entity13 ( 1:00 bst ) on 6 august 2014 as it gradually makes its way towards @entity19			2
the country is bracing itself for high waves and heavy rain this weekend , where @entity8 is forecast to make landfall			1
@entity8 will hit @entity100 saturday local time and slam into western @entity101 saturday evening the composite image was made up of infra - red data from the geostationary satellites of the @entity110 and the @entity63			2
a separate storm , out of shot , which that has been battering the @entity115 has a 60 per cent chance of hitting the south of @entity118 , the @entity26 has warned			0
the remains of hurricane @entity120 , which has now weakened in to an @entity122 storm , will come steadily towards the @entity123 during the next few days			0
forecasters now predict it is expected to pass over , or close to , the @entity123 from early on sunday after initially believing the @entity123 was ' likely ' to stay out of its path			0
while the south of @entity118 is most at risk , there is a 30 per cent chance the storm could pass across the north of @entity133 and just miss the @entity123			0
@entity9 pictured over the @entity3 , where it is moving gradually westwards towards @entity18			1
@entity51 is described by the @entity134 as an annular hurricane , because it has a large symmetrical eye with relatively little convection to create rain bands outside the centre			0

image taken this morning shows @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity9 , and @entity9
@entity51 , with winds of 80 mph ( 128 kph ) , is set to hit @entity18 which is poised to take its first direct hit in 22 years
@entity19 is also bracing itself for high waves and heavy rain this weekend , where @entity8 is forecast to make landfall
