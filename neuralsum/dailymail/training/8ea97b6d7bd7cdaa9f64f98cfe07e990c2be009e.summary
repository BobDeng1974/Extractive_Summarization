with parents in the foreign service , he was raised in integrated schools all over the world and was used to multiculturalism			2
' every time i would come back ( to the @entity5 , ) i would see people separated by race , ' he explains in a new interview with @entity17			2
' when my father was telling me about ( the @entity2 ) at the age of 10 it did n’t make any sense to me			1

the two sat down to talk and the man told @entity0 he was in the @entity2			1
' at first , i thought ‘ why the hell am i sitting with him ? ’ @entity0 said			1
' but we struck up a friendship and it was music that brought us together , ' he says			2
little did @entity0 know at the time , this man would be the key to his future endeavors			1
eight ears later @entity0 decided to write a book examining the @entity2 and managed to track his friend down			1
' i went to his apartment unannounced , ' @entity0 says			1
' he opens the door and sees me , and he says '' @entity56 ! what are you doing here ? '' ' he stepped out of his apartment and i stepped in			2
he said ‘ what ’s going on man ? are you still playing ? ’ ' i said ‘ i need to talk to you about the @entity2 '			1
' at first the man refused to cooperate , saying it would put @entity0 in danger , but eventually he handed over the information of @entity65 , who was the leader of the @entity2 in @entity66			1
the man warned @entity0 to meet @entity65 in a public place out of safety			1
@entity0 had his secretary set up a meeting , instructing her to not tell @entity65 he was black			1
' i knew enough about the mentality of the @entity2 that they would never think a white woman would work for a black man , ' he said			1
@entity0 has explained how he began befriending members of the @entity2 , which eventually lead to the dismantlement of some factions and at least 20 members dis - robing and leaving the @entity80 the pair met a hotel , with the secretary fetching an ice bucket with sodas			1
the meeting was ' fraught with tension from the start ' after @entity65 arrived with a nighthawk - an armed bodyguard dressed in military fatigues			1
' i saw the apprehension ( when @entity65 realized i 'm black ) so i got up and walked over and said '' hi mr. @entity65 , come on in ''			2
' he shook my hand , the bodyguard shook my hand , and they came in			2
mr. @entity65 sits down and the bodyguard stands at his right			2
' he asked for identification and i handed him my drivers ’ license			2
he says '' oh you live on @entity101 in @entity102 ' ’			2
' well , i did n’t need him coming to my house and burning a cross or whatever , and here he is calling off my street address			0
' i wanted to let him know not to come to my house so i said ‘ yes , and you live at … ’ and i said his street address			0
' i made it clear - ’ let ’s confine our visit to this hotel room			0
’ ' but i had no reason to be concerned			0
one of his klan members lived right down the street from me			2
' the interview began and each time @entity0 reached into his bag to get a new cassette for his voice recorder , the bodyguard would reach for his gun			1
@entity0 said the man relaxed ' after a little while '			1
but that 's when the trouble started			0
' after about an hour , there was a very loud , strange noise which was ominous , and i was apprehensive			0
' in the back of my mind , i heard my friend in my head saying '' mr. @entity65 will kill you ''			0
' i stood up and slammed my hands on the table , and i felt my life was in danger			0
' when my hands hit the table , my eyes locked with his , and he could read them			0
we stared into each others eyes			0
' the bodyguard was looking back and forth at us , but then my secretary @entity146 realized what had happened			0
' the ice bucket had melted and the cans of soda shifted , and that ’s what made the noise ! ' we all began laughing at how stupid we all had been			0
' in retrospect , it was a very important lesson that was taught			0
' all because a foreign entity of which we were ignorant , entered into our comfort zone , we became fearful of each other			0
' the lesson learned is : ignorance breeds fear			0
if you do n’t keep that fear in check , that fear will breed hatred			0
' if you do n’t keep hatred in check it will breed destruction			0
' the situation made way for a friendship with @entity65 , which lead @entity65 to start relationships with about 20 other @entity2 members			1
he has collected about that many robes and hoods that were given to him by members who left the @entity2 after meeting him			1
@entity0 is credited with dismantling the @entity2 because the group 's structure ' fell apart ' after he began making inroads with the men			1
@entity0 said he would simply challenge the many misconceptions @entity2 had about black people as a result of brainwashing			1
in one circumstance , a member told him that ' all black people had a gene that makes them violent '			2
he countered by saying that ' all white people have a gene that makes them serial killers			0
' he said '' that 's stupid '' and i said it 's just as stupid as what you said to me			0
he was very quiet after that and i know it was sinking in , ' @entity0 said			1
@entity0 also became close with @entity200 , a leader in the @entity2 known as a @entity201			1
' i respect someone ’s right to air their views whether they are wrong or right , ' @entity0 said			1
' @entity200 was a @entity201 who had gone to prison numerous times			0
' i said i wanted to interview him for my book			2
' at first , he was very violent and very hateful but we talked for a long time			0
' over time , he began thinking about a lot of things he had done and said that were wrong			0
' he quit the @entity2			1
' toward the end he said he would follow me to hell and back ... and he gave me his robe and hood			0
' all these relationships and experiences have been documented in @entity0 ' book , @entity221 , in which he concludes that the best way to break down barriers and improve race relations is for people who disagree to sit down and talk			1
' invite your enemy to talk - give them a platform to talk because then they will reciprocate , ' he said			0
' invite your enemies to sit down and join you			0
' one small thing you say might give them food for though , and you will learn			0
it ’s when the talking stops that the ground becomes fertile for fighting			0
' when two enemies are talking , they 're not fighting			0
