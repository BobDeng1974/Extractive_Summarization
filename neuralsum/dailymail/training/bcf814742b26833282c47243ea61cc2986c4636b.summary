@entity0 wants to ensure @entity2 continue their unbeaten start to their @entity4 campaign @entity2 's win over @entity46 strugglers @entity6 should have been more emphatic , but for some wasteful finishing , but @entity0 was satisfied with a fifth win in an unbeaten seven matches at the start of the season			1
' it 's great to have a winning mentality , ' he added			0
' if you have a couple of sticky results it puts the pressure on going into games but at the moment we 're unbeaten , we 're going well and we should have confidence , especially playing in front of our own fans at @entity13			0

they made it tough for us but thankfully we won			0
' @entity87 's debut goal was cancelled out by @entity88 before @entity89 netted what proved to be the winner on a night when victory should have been more convincing and @entity93 , in particular , should have scored			0
