as homegrown favourites such as @entity10 and @entity12 decline in popularity , shoppers can not get enough of @entity16 apples from @entity17 , whose sales are growing faster than any other variety			1

in fact , the @entity16 – a cross between the biggest sellers , the @entity31 and the @entity32 – is becoming such a fruitbowl favourite that it is grown in orchards across @entity3			2
the @entity10 ’s demise will be hard for traditionalists to swallow			2
the sweet - smelling , juicy , orange - red apples have been enjoyed for generations , but they are difficult to grow and susceptible to disease , which makes them less profitable than modern varieties			0

in @entity3 , the growing licence is held by @entity47 , which began the world ’s largest single apple plantation programme in this country in 2006			0
