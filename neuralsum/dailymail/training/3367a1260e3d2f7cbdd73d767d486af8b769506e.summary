by @entity0 published : 05:59 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 10 april 2013 a bike enthusiast has been dubbed the ' eco rider ' after building an electric version of a classic motorcycle			0
@entity5 has created a stretched bike that can be propelled by a 36 volt battery - powered motor or by pedal - power			1
the 56 - year - old chopper motorbike fan wanted a custom - made version of the bike immortalised in the cult 1969 film @entity14 , and he wanted it to be inexpensive and eco-friendly			1
the motor allows it to travel at a top speed of 20mph but the battery needs recharging every 30 minutes			1
it can be powered solely by pedalling , just using the motor , or using a combination of the two			0
it is virtually silent , emission free and very cheap to run			1
so , he spent £ 1,000 making the 6ft 5ins long bike that features 3.5ft long elongated front forks and handlebars to give it a recumbent appearance			2
however , ' road trips ' on the bike are limited as it has a top speed of 20mph and can only run for 30 miles before the battery needs recharging or pedal - power has to be employed			1
mr @entity5 , from @entity45 , @entity46 , set about making the bike after he was made redundant from his job as a university scientific support officer and found himself with time on his hands			2
he created by the bespoke frame with help from a firm that specialises in metal tubing			0
he then purchased an old @entity56 chopper bicycle from @entity57 and dismantled it so he could use some of the parts			2
he paid for the elongated front forks to be shipped over from @entity60 and attached the lithium battery which is hidden in one of the panniers			0
mr @entity5 has created a stretched bike that can be propelled by a 36 volt battery - powered motor or by pedal - power the 56 - year - old chopper motorbike fan wanted a custom - made version of the bike immortalised in the cult 1969 film @entity14 they see me rollin : @entity5 's green ' chopper ' can reach a maximum 20mph as he speeds down the streets the blue bike , which was built in mr @entity5 ’s workshop at his home , is virtually silent , emission free and far cheaper to run than any normal motorbike			1
maybe that is why he often gets thumbs - up signs , and comments like ' cool bike ' , whenever he rides the machine through the streets of @entity45			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i have been building custom motorbikes for years but with petrol becoming ever more expensive , an eco-friendly means of transport made perfect sense			2
‘ also , everything these days needs to be tested and if you build a custom motorbike from scratch it needs to be inspected and insured but you can make a bicycle how you want to			0
he spent £ 1,000 making the 6ft 5ins long bike that features 3.5ft long elongated front forks and handlebars			2
his partner , @entity102 , is pictured finishing the frame ' road trips ' on the bike are limited as it has a top speed of 20mph and can only run for 30 miles before the battery ( pictured in a saddle bag ) needs recharging ‘ i wanted to make a version of a chopper as i have always loved them , so to customise a bicycle in this way seemed like the best of both worlds			1
’ he added : ‘ you can use the bike in three ways ; operate it completely by pedalling , use the auto - pedalling feature that kicks in the motor or use the thumb throttle			0
‘ as it relies on a battery it is absolutely quiet and there are no emissions			0
‘ people often point it out when i 'm riding it and some say i must have long legs or that it looks hard to ride , but that 's far from the truth			0
’ happy chopper : @entity5 's bike is modelled on a classic chopper motorbike , such as this one , but is much kinder to the environment ( file photo ) he purchased an old @entity56 chopper bicycle from @entity57 and dismantled it so he could use some of the parts mr @entity5 was inspired by the 1969 film @entity14 which immortalised the chopper motorbike			1

@entity5 created type of chopper motorbike powered by 36 volt battery
it can also be pedalled if necessary as it is *largely* made from bicycle parts
it cost £ 1,000 , can reach 20mph , and needs recharging every 30 minutes
it is almost silent , it is emission free , and it is very cheap to run
