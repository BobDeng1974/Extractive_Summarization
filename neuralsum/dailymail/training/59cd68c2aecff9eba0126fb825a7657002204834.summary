she added that on occasions , the taunts referred to the dead child			2

pictures the family took included the widow flashing a v sign as she passed their home			0

she told how the children were playing in a paddling pool when @entity2 began shouting over the fence			1
the court heard she was singing about being ‘ on @entity134 ’ because she had avoided prison , and spoke loudly about how she hoped the soldier would n’t return from @entity28 ‘ but probably would because he would hide behind others ’			0
the mother said : ‘ she spoke about us being vultures and that we were in it for the money			0
‘ my heart was racing			0
i could n’t believe what she was saying			0
‘ i ca n’t explain how it made us all feel			0
quiet street campaign : the family moved into the street ( house pictured far right ) to make a ' fresh start ' next to @entity2 ' house ( centre ) and initially got on well with her ‘ i know what she was trying to do to us			1
her aim was to get us out of the house			0
she said that she managed to get the previous neighbours out			2
‘ i felt her aim was to get us out of the house			0
why ? i do n’t know			0
was it the children ? i just do n’t know			2
unless you were involved in it , you ca n’t understand what we were going through			0
’ @entity2 committed three further breaches of the restraining order in early september			1
she made retching noises at the family , called the mother ‘ scum ’ and insulted the children			2
the woman said : ‘ i ca n’t explain what she ’s done to us without getting upset			0
when it ’s directed at you and your family and your security it ’s totally destructive and it has been			0

‘ i ’m a proud man			0
i ’m proud of my job			0
i am 6 ’ 1 ” and a well - built soldier who has served his country in war zones all over the world			0
