building a house from scratch , even a tiny one , is not for the faint of heart , but 14 - year - old @entity5 has proven she has what it takes to see her passion project through against overwhelming odds			1
@entity5 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , started work on her diminutive dwelling , lovingly dubbed @entity14 , when she was 12			1
at the time , the girl was searching for an outside - the - box idea for a school project when she stumbled upon a sizable online community of @entity20 builders specializing in downsized homes			0
her mother , @entity44 , who was also her teacher and the founder of her school , signed up as @entity29 's project manager , but the girl was to act as the chief architect , builder and fundraiser on the project			0
@entity29 got the project off the ground by launching an online fundraising campaign in january 2013			0
within less than a month , the middle - schooler reached - and then exceeded - her $ 1,500 goal			2
' my decision to build a tiny house was partly economic , partly the desire to be free , ' @entity5 wrote in the description			1
' building a tiny house can give me stability , possibly for the rest of my life if i build the house well			0
tough guy : @entity71 , pictured left with his daughter , was a sailor by trade and a woodworking enthusiast special helper : while @entity29 was the main architect and builder , her father assisted her with blueprints and power tools ' building a house would give me the life skills that really matter , such as using tools for construction			1
building the house i can know what labors go into a home and truly appreciate what i am living in			0
' around the same time , @entity29 launched the blog @entity14 to offer updates on her progress			0
the 12 - year - old and her father , a sailor and woodworking enthusiast , got down to work , drawing blueprints for her future dwelling and erecting a birdhouse and scale models for practice			1
after some initial growing pains , the father - and - team team got the hang of working together , with @entity71 learning how to restrain himself and allow his daughter to do it her way			1
on her part , the plucky 12 - year - old quickly picked up the construction jargon from her dad and learned how to safely use his power tools			2
then on february 16 , everything ground to a halt : @entity29 ’s father was killed in a car accident			1
as her mother wrote on her daughter 's blog two months later , @entity42 's untimely passing caused @entity29 to lose interest in the project			0
dream team : @entity29 pictured with her late father , @entity42 , who taught her the basics of construction and using power tools picking up the pieces : a couple of months after the car accident that killed @entity29 's dad , the girl immersed herself into the building project with the help of friends and @entity20 enthusiasts learning on the job : the middle - schooler went from a building neophyte to a real pro around drills and jigsaws but under the guidance of her father 's long - time friend and professional homebuilder , @entity149 , @entity29 once again immersed herself into her work on the tiny house , which now took on a deeper meaning for the grieving middle - schooler			1
the family and their friends made their way to a local @entity158 for supplies , revamped the blueprints and picked up where @entity29 and @entity42 left off all these months ago			2
not before long , @entity29 and her mother were overwhelmed with support from loved ones and neighbors who would stop by the house to lend a hand with the myriad of tasks that go into building a house			0
but @entity71 's passing left a profound mark on @entity29 : she was sullen and distracted in school , no longer as engaged in softball as before and lacking zest for life			2
to get away from it all , @entity44 and @entity29 went on a five - week road trip , staying with friends in the @entity180 and enjoying long drives , just the two of them			2
when they returned home in time for the start of a new school semester , @entity29 made up her mind to finish what she and her dad had started			0
downsized : the cozy home features the bare necessities , including a loft bedroom big enough to fit a queen - size bed and storage space this time , however , the now - 13 - year - old aspiring builder appealed to the boarder community , from other tiny - home aficionados on @entity198 to experts and friends eager to pitch in			2
many people volunteered their time , among them a roofer who put a top on @entity29 ’s humble abode free of charge ; a retiree who instructed her in the art of wiring the house , and other homebuilders who showed @entity29 how to plumb her kitchen and bathroom			2
what started as a school project over time blossomed into a 128 - square - foot labor of love , as well as a tribute to @entity29 ’s father			1
despite her tender age , @entity5 showed everyone that she was dedicated to the project and determined to see it to completion , putting in long hours , navigating challenges and problem - solving on the fly like a seasoned pro. ‘ it was n't until later ... probably these past couple months that i realized why i 'm doing this , ’ @entity29 said			1
‘ i 'm doing it to show him that i can do stuff , to show him that i am capable and he does n't need to yell at me when i ca n't use the drill			0
’ last december , @entity29 traveled to @entity235 to give a speech at a @entity238 conference , talking to other teens about the joys and challenges of tiny - home construction - and healing			1
it takes a village : with the help of experts and staff at a @entity248 , @entity29 learned how to plumb her tiny kitchen and wire the house home on wheels : when @entity29 and her mother move to @entity255 this summer , her house will be coming with them around the same time , she was asked to pen a first - person account about her experiences for the @entity259			1
‘ sometimes when people get a hard knock , they stay down			0
that 's my claim to fame , ’ she wrote			0
‘ i also wanted to show that when i was handed lemons , i not only made lemonade			0
i made a lemon cake			0
’ last month , @entity29 announced on her blog that her wooden masterpiece boasting a bedroom , fully functioning kitchen and bathroom , a closet and storage cubbyholes , was finally finished			1
from start to finish , it took @entity29 and her many helpers a year - and - a - half of labor and $ 10,000 to get the job done			1
the charming little bungalow painted royal blue with a white trim for now sits in the @entity286 ' backyard in @entity10			0
when the family move to @entity289 this summer , @entity29 ’s house will travel with them			1
the girl , now 14 years old , is already thinking of her next makeover project : rebuilding a rickety , old @entity293 .			0

it took @entity5 , of @entity11 , a year and a half of labor and $ 10,000 to build the 128 - square - foot bungalow with a bedroom , kitchen and bathroom
@entity29 lost her father , @entity71 , in a car accident a month after construction began
she plans to take her tiny dwelling to @entity289 when the family move there in the summer
