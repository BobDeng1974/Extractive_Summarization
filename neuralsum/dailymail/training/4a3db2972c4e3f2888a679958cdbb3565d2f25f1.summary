the court heard that @entity2 had been diagnosed with @entity34 's syndrome , a form of autism , since his arrest last week , he was granted bail today but prosecutors immediately objected , meaning that he will remain in custody until monday when an appeal will be heard			1

the conditions also state that no device capable of accessing the internet can be within his home address , that he must live and sleep at that address , and that he must not leave his address other than in the company of his mother , @entity78			0
