published : 10:03 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 11:00 est , 12 march 2014 a north @entity2 mayor who is in jail on drug charges has resigned from office			1
@entity7 mayor , @entity6 , was suspended from office in november and is being held in the @entity9 on allegations of selling oxycodone			1
@entity6 was suspended from office in november and submitted his resignation on tuesday			1
he has not posted $ 4,500 bail			2
he remains in jail unable to cover the $ 4,500 bond uncertain future : the tiny town of @entity7 in northern @entity2 could be wiped off the map after an audit showed city officials have mishandled town funds to a comical degree officials say @entity6 asked city councilman @entity30 , who is a sergeant at the jail , to help him with the resignation			1
@entity30 says @entity6 did n't want to ' embarrass ' the city any more			1
the decision allows the city to move forward with an election			2
acting mayor @entity37 has been running the city since november			1
@entity6 's arrest came just weeks after he was elected			1
the city has 500 residents			2
' i ride a bicycle around town			0
i had my lights cut off twice last year			0
if i am a dope dealer , why are my lights getting cut off , ' @entity6 asked @entity47 in an interview from jail			1
' i 'm a good guy that got caught up in a bunch of nonsense that was bigger than me			0
' @entity6 has been in jail since around @entity19 because he ca n't afford the $ 4,500 bond			1
@entity2 gov. @entity55 immediately suspended @entity6 after his arrest , but the mayor submitted his official letter of resignation on tuesday , his letter was short , and to the point			1
' i , @entity6 , being of sound mind and body , ask that you would please accept this letter as notification that i am leaving my position with the city of @entity7 , effective immediately			1
' @entity6 's arrest , which came just weeks after he had taken office , is n't the only thing that has drawn attention to @entity7 , a 1 - square - mile city of less than 500 people in @entity9			1
low hanging fruit : there are n't many people in sleepy @entity7 , but its location along a busy highway made it the perfect speed trap town a state audit found 31 violations of the city 's charter , and violations of federal codes and laws and a shocking misuse of funds in the tiny town			1
$ 132,000 was spent at the @entity92 convenience store next door to @entity94			2
' what 's wrong with that picture ? ' @entity95 , mayor from 2000 to 2008 , asked @entity47			2
' that 's a lot of cigarettes and beer and what - have - you			0
that 's corrupt as heck			0
' they also found that city employees had racked up $ 27,000 in charges on the city 's credit card for ' no public purpose ' and that the city police cars were n't even insured			1
though , there were plenty of them			0
the city keeps a bloated police force in order to continue pursuing what many say is its sole purpose : ticketing drivers as they drive through town			2
the town has even extended its city limits 1,260 feet down the width of a busy highway in order to lay claim to any and all traffic violations -- end their accompanying ticket fines -- that occur there			2
the sight of @entity134 sitting alongside @entity135 301 on lawn chairs and pointing their radar gun at passersby bas become the norm on the outskirts of town			0
they became infamous for ticketing anyone and everyone they possibly could for even the tiniest of infractions and between 2010 and 2012 raked in an unbelievable $ 616,960 in fines			2
beginning of the end : the town became infamous for all the speeding tickets it issued an between 2010 and 2012 , the city collected over $ 600,000 in fines			1
but the state would soon want to know where all the money went the money allowed them to upgrade their police cars to suvs and check drivers ' speed while wearing pricey riot gear			2
one such police officer became known by the nickname @entity167 because of his swagger and the ar - 15 rifle he wore while greeting vacationing speeders during traffic stops			0
' it became ' serve and collect ' instead of ' serve and protect			0
' cash register justice , ' local sheriff @entity174 told @entity47			0
' do y'all remember the old @entity176 ? @entity177 ? they make @entity177 look like a sunday school teacher			0
' to save themselves further headache , state officials -- including state senator @entity183 , whose district includes @entity7 -- say they just want the town erased from the map			1
' it ’s like something out of a @entity190 novel , ' @entity183 told @entity191			0
that 's a lot of cigarettes : pictured is the @entity7 town hall			2
not pictured is the @entity92 convenience store next door where city officials managed to rack up a $ 132,000 tab @entity183 said the support to wipe away the mistakes of @entity7 's past is strong with area @entity203 as well as in the legislature			1

police in shiny new cruisers toting top - of - the - line guns and combat gear purchased with ticket money would often hide behind this dumpster			0
only , some of those cars were n't even insured @entity7 , @entity2 has been a town for 89 years , but its notoriety as a ruthless speed trap may soon be its undoing			1
a state audit found the town had violated state and local laws with 31 misdeeds , some of them egregious and some of them just unbelievable			1
