by @entity0 published : 10:29 est , 22 october 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 22 october 2013 @entity2 's central bank has warned of a housing boom in the country with soaring property prices in the country ' difficult to justify '			1
according to @entity9 , a surge of foreign investment has seen housing in some of the economic powerhouse 's major cities overvalued by as much as 20 per cent			1
in a monthly report , the country 's top financial institution fired a warning that price rises for apartments and flats in the major cities , did not stand up to valuations based on basic methods			1
in demand : properties such as these in @entity26 , @entity27 are said to be popular with foreign investors the statement will serve to ramp up concern of a real estate boom in @entity2			2
in popular cities such as @entity27 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , the price of apartments and flats had risen by 25 per cent on average since 2010			2
the report reads : ' over the past three years , the prices for houses and apartments ( nationally ) have risen by a total of 8.25 percent			2
' the report said that the increase could ' give rise to fears of a broad - based property price boom '			0
the bank said that property prices were driven up by an increase in demand for @entity2 property , caused by slumps in other countries during the economic downturn			1
it also said that housing had become seen as a more reliable than other forms of investment			0
but whereas @entity65 cities such as @entity66 and @entity67 have put legislation in place to tax foreign buyers in a bid to maintain stability in their housing market , @entity2 have welcomed investment			0
depsite the fears of a ' bubble ' however , @entity9 believes that it is very unlikely that higher property prices will lead to financial instability			1
steady : the strength @entity2 economy under @entity82 has been a big pull for property investors the conditions placed on mortgages in @entity2 are much tougher than in the @entity87 and other parts of @entity89 , meaning that banks and other lenders would probably not be severely affected by a mini bust			1
@entity93 , a senior economist at @entity94 , said that despite the beginnings of regional exaggerations , a bubble does not seem to be in the offing in @entity2			0
he said : ' there are no reasons , yet , to call the latest developments the start of a typical bubble as experienced in other countries before			0
' mortgage growth has remained limited , loan - to - value ratios in @entity2 have been stable at around 80 percent and the large majority of @entity2 still prefer mortgages with fixed - rather than variable - rates			0
' even if the @entity9 's assessment of a fundamental overvaluation looks justified , prices , at least in urban areas , could , in the short run , still further increase on the back of low interest rates and limited supply			0

investors have *flocked* to @entity2 because of strong economy
report by @entity9 has *sparked* fear of property bubble
they say prices of flats and apartments in major cities are ' difficult to justify '
