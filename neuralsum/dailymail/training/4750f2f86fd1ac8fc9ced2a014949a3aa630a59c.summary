' @entity3 is another term for @entity3			0
@entity25 reports that previously it was assumed only a small number of the @entity1 believed to be in @entity4 were fighting alongside @entity3			1
' we believe that there are approximately 100 @entity1 passport holders operating inside of @entity4 , we do n’t know specifically who they are aligning themselves with			1
we believe that there are maybe a dozen that are with @entity3 , ' col. @entity32 said			2
the @entity1 are far from being unique			0
it 's estimated more than 12,000 foreign fighters have joined rebel groups across the region over the last three years , an estimated 1,000 of whom are @entity41			2

' he added that these groups do not have the ability to launch large - scale attacks on @entity1 soil as @entity56 has			0

the @entity99 magazine put the number at 70 on tuesday , citing a mishmash of statistics from the @entity103 , the @entity105 - based @entity104 for the @entity106 , and the @entity108 - based @entity107			0
but hard numbers have been hard to come by , and @entity111 's admission sheds new light on the size of the problem			0

there ’s been significant operational collaboration between @entity139 , @entity140 and all of their foreign counterparts , including @entity142 , on this effort			0
president @entity122 drew criticism wednesday in @entity145 for backing off of his resolve to ' destroy ' @entity3 with a weaker pledge to make it ' manageable ' @entity71 ( left ) , who died fighting for @entity3 in @entity4 this year , was a high school pal of @entity74 ( right ) , who died fighting for @entity76 in @entity77 in 2009 @entity111 said wednesday that with so many @entity1 passport - holders able to re-enter the @entity1 after joining the @entity3 jihad , ' we ca n't take a chance ... on saying , " well , let 's technically define this			1
is it a real threat today or tomorrow ? " ' he reiterated the resolve of @entity1 officials including president @entity122 and secretary of state @entity160 to wipe the @entity87 terror group off the map			1
@entity1 's mission in @entity62 , @entity111 said on @entity164 , is ' not " contain			1
" it ’s exactly what the president said : " degrade and destroy "			0
' @entity122 caught flak on wednesday morning in @entity145 for waffling between hard - line and soft - pedal positions on the @entity87 group that has cut a wide and deadly swath through massive portions of eastern @entity4 and northern @entity62			1
the primary @entity1 objective ' is to degrade and destroy ' @entity3 ' so that it ’s no longer a threat not just to @entity62 but also the region and to the @entity1 , ' the president said during a press conference			1

' terrorists who behead @entity1 are not " manageable , " @entity198 said in a statement			0
' they must be stopped , and we need president @entity122 to communicate a clear strategy and goals on how he plans to eliminate this threat			0
' @entity111 , meanwhile , clung to @entity122 's first statement while ignoring the second			1
' you 've got to destroy it , ' he said of @entity3 , ' because if we do n't destroy it , it will get worse			1
' the soft - spoken defense secretary stopped short of offering any guarantees , however			2
' vows are something beyond my mortal capacity of doing , ' he said			0
' we will do everything possible that we can do to destroy their capacity to inflict harm on our people and @entity226 values and our interests			0
' the @entity0 will achieve the @entity123 's strategic objectives , @entity111 explained , by cooking up a menu of tactical options for @entity122 to choose from			2
@entity231 ( left ) was beheaded in a gruesome video distributed by @entity3 this week , following a heart - rending videotaped appeal to the terror group 's leaders last week from his mother ( right ) ' our mission , ' he said , ' is to provide him those options and those plans to accomplish the mission of " destroy and degrade " the capability of @entity3			1
' and speaking of the growing number of @entity1 who have taken up arms against @entity1 interests and allies in the @entity20 , he conceded that ' this crowd is a dangerous crowd			1
' ' this crowd is as dangerous a group of people – beyond just terrorists – they are an army , ' he said , ' marrying this with an ideology and a capacity to do things			0
' ' they control half of @entity62 today			0
they control half of @entity4 today			0
we better be taking them seriously			0
' @entity122 will lead a @entity266 @entity265 meeting this month devoted to the question of how to handle foreign fighters and whether to restrict their movements			0
