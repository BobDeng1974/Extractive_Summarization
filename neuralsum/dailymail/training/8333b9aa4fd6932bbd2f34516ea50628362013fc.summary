by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 6 january 2013 updated : 19:21 est , 6 january 2013 @entity1 has launched a blistering attack on the @entity4 police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities			1
the @entity8 founder claimed @entity12 ’s high - profile @entity10 ’s focus on the famous could even jeopardise the chances of young abuse victims seeing justice			1
she said the £ 2million investigation – which has seen @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 among those arrested – was in danger of trivialising and sensationalising child abuse			1
unhappy : @entity1 ( left , in @entity23 in may 2011 ) has launched a blistering attack on the @entity4 ( right , also in @entity23 , in april 1998 ) police inquiry team over its concentration on arresting celebrities celebrities rounded up by the @entity29 inquiry would forever be tainted even if no charges were ever brought , she said			1
before he became the latest high - profile @entity32 arrest last week , comedian @entity17 said the inquiry had become a ‘ witch hunt ’			1
in october , miss @entity1 took part in the @entity36 documentary which exposed @entity4 as a predatory paedophile and memorably admitted : ‘ we all blocked our ears to the gossip ’ about the shamed star			1
but now she has turned on @entity10 , which was set up to examine hundreds of claims of abuse in the wake of the @entity45 revelations			1
in a sunday newspaper article , she wrote : ‘ when @entity47 swoops – and celebrity after celebrity has been targeted by them – we assume they ’ve uncovered yet more sexual abuse of children			1
’ yet in many cases , she said , the stars were defending themselves against ‘ historic ’ allegations of sexual abuse brought by women who were in their twenties at the time			1
protest of innocent : former radio 1 dj @entity62 ( pictured in november 2012 ) has made clear that the allegations he has been questioned over do not relate to children or to @entity65 @entity17 , publicist @entity19 and former @entity62 @entity62 have all made clear that the allegations they have been questioned over do not relate to children or to @entity65			1
miss @entity1 called on commander @entity71 , the officer leading @entity32 , to change the inquiry and avert the risk of creating a public backlash			1
@entity4 preyed on patients and staff in a hospice for the terminally ill , it was claimed yesterday			2
@entity12 is planning to list all the establishments – including hospitals , prisons and schools – where @entity4 chose his victims over 60 years			2
his association with @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity89 hospitals is well known , but it is thought he may have abused people in at least seven other institutions			2
@entity47 should be split up , with a different codename for allegations which have nothing to do with children or @entity65 , she said , otherwise victims could be deterred from speaking out			2
more than 500 women have come forward with allegations about abuse to @entity10			1
detectives have divided the cases into three categories , the first two linked to @entity65 , and the third termed ‘ others ’ – which have nothing to do with him			2
the allegations against @entity17 , 59 , fall into this third category			1
his lawyer @entity109 said last week : ‘ two women have made allegations in respect of @entity17 that date back approximately 25 years			1
the complainants were then in their mid- 20s			0
@entity17 vigorously denies the allegations			1
‘ he answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time			0
he has not been charged with any offence			0
’ eleven weeks after the launch of @entity10 , police have recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which @entity4 is a suspect , with 31 allegations of rape			1
by @entity1 arrested : comedian @entity17 pictured with his wife @entity127 in @entity23 in july 2004 first , let me declare my interest			1
i took part in the notorious @entity36 programme , @entity131 , which broke the news that the late sir @entity4 , at the time regarded as a national treasure and mourned for his charity work , was in fact a predatory paedophile			0
and as president of @entity8 , i am also a trustee of the @entity139 , who actively support the work of @entity10 , the unit set up by the @entity29 to look into allegations of abuse by @entity4 and others			1
so i must stress that my opinions are mine alone , not those of the @entity36 programme - makers , nor of the @entity139			0
i personally believe that @entity10 needs to change , and change quickly			1
otherwise the policeman in charge , commander @entity71 , dedicated to uncovering crime , runs the risk that he will create a backlash instead			0
@entity47 could make it harder than ever for victims of abuse to ask for help , or gain the justice they deserve			1
for the latest arrest of comedian @entity17 is deeply confusing			1
@entity47 is about child abuse , is n’t it ? after all , it was set up as a direct result of the @entity45 revelations			1
the @entity139 is supporting the @entity32 investigations because it is a charity dedicated to protecting children against abuse			2
when @entity169 swoops , and celebrity after celebrity has been targeted by them , we assume that they have uncovered yet more sexual abuse of children			2
but it turns out that @entity17 has not been accused of abusing any children			1
he is defending himself against historic accusations brought by two women who were in their twenties at the time			0
he is of course innocent unless he is proved guilty , and he vigorously denies the accusations			0
but the danger is that he is now tainted , and will be for ever			2
and the taint is the false implication that he was somehow involved with the @entity65 crimes against children			0
exactly why have @entity10 arrested @entity18 , and @entity62 , and @entity19 , and the others ? nobody has yet been charged ; when and if they are , we will be better informed			1
but in the meantime , all these people have also been tainted			0
and even if no charges are brought , the damage will have been done , the taint will be there , simply by branding all these arrests with the @entity169 label			0
@entity10 should go back to its original purpose , and focus on child abuse			1
the label should be limited specifically to allegations of the sexual abuse of children , by those who committed their crimes alongside @entity4			2
we must discover whether there was a paedophile ring			0
we urgently need to know if others over the years also escaped justice			0
their victims also deserve a voice			0
we need to know the truth , if we are to learn lessons and move forward			0
' exactly why have @entity10 arrested @entity18 , and @entity62 , and @entity19 , and the others ? nobody has yet been charged ; when and if they are , we will be better informed			1
but in the meantime , all these people have also been tainted ' but let ’s not label every sexual crime by a celebrity over the past 40 years as @entity47			0
all sexual crimes are sickening , whether they are attacks on adult men or women , or on children			0
i ’m not for one moment implying that complaints should not be taken seriously and investigated			0
just that unless it ’s a crime against a child , do n’t label it yewtree			2
commander @entity71 , split your unit , and find another operational name for accusations that have nothing to do with children , nor with @entity4			0
and concentrate on the real question			0
why did it take so long for the truth about @entity4 to emerge ? why was he never tried and convicted for his hundreds of crimes ? the truth is that our legal system is so heavily weighted against children that most sexual abuse cases never reach the courtroom			2
when children give evidence they are subjected to cross-examination which many children have told me is as painful as the original abuse			2
one criminal barrister told me : ‘ i do n’t care how great a monster my client is , and what it takes to break down a child , it ’s my job to do it and i will			2
’ so you can understand why the police were reluctant to take the cases against @entity45 to court			1
no jury in the world , they thought , would believe the word of a vulnerable child against one of the nation ’s most skilled and most admired entertainers , knighted for his achievements for charity			2
and this is still happening			0
a few days ago i met a family , furious and deeply distressed because a number of abused children were prevented from giving evidence , because one was reduced to tears by the cross-examination			0
so yet another dangerous abuser got away with his many crimes , and he is still at large			0
it would be wonderful if @entity10 resulted in a better , safer world for children			1
but it would be tragic if the £ 2million police inquiry simply trivialised and sensationalised the whole operation			0
this is not about celebrity headlines			0
this is about real crimes against real children			0
the tragic truth is that it is still happening today			0
and unless we learn the crucial lessons , more children will be forced to suffer in silence			0
