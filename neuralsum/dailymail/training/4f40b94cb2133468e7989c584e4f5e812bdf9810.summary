@entity0 had just finished holding court when he spun on his heels and made his way out of @entity5 ’s press auditorium			1
@entity7 ’s manager grabbed at the handle of the first door he saw and immediately marched through it before he had to abruptly halt			1
the door in question led into a pantry and , with a wry smile , he was forced to double back			0
it was the only wrong move he made all day			0
in the moments beforehand , @entity0 had conducted himself with class and dignity			2
there was no boasting or revelling in a triumph over @entity22 but it was clear from spending time in his company that this was a man bursting with pride at a job well done			2
@entity0 's young @entity7 side beat @entity22 1 - 0 at @entity5 thanks to a @entity31 goal no wonder			1
@entity0 enjoys visiting @entity5 — in five trips with @entity35 ( as a player ) , @entity37 and @entity7 , he has yet to be beaten — but there was more to this than merely savouring @entity31 ’s solitary strike			1
here , he felt , was a performance to show his side are coming of age			0
‘ these young players have become men this season , ’ said @entity0 , extolling the displays in particular of @entity45 and @entity46			1
‘ if they can grow together and we get one or two back from injury we ’ll be really strong			2
’ the last few years have been fallow at @entity52 and @entity0 has had to ride some punches but , suddenly , things appear to be falling into place			1
@entity0 has yet to be beaten at @entity5 either as a player or manager despite making five trips there @entity22 might have dominated possession but @entity0 had @entity7 immaculately drilled			1
@entity45 , for one , marshalled his defence , @entity46 held the midfield together with exemplary passing and , around him , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 buzzed with intent			0
‘ it is early days but the chairman ’s come out and said what he ’s said ( about selling ) , ’ @entity0 continued			1
‘ everybody knows the situation and that ’s helped			2
it ’s galvanised the supporters who ’ve been brilliant since i ’ve been here			0
@entity65 ( left ) , @entity46 , @entity75 and @entity63 impressed against @entity22 ‘ since the start of the season we have been fantastic			1
this is another clean sheet			0
but it ’s a long road			0
’ retaining perspective wo n’t be an issue			2
@entity0 deals in pragmatism , while his assistant , @entity84 , emerged from the dugout at key moments , growling at @entity7 ’s midfielders to retain their focus			1
if all was right in the world for @entity0 , the same could not be said for @entity90			2
@entity22 ’s defending continues to alarm and questions persist over the suitability of @entity94 and @entity95 to this project			2
@entity31 's goal early in the first half was enough to give @entity7 a well - deserved victory the goal @entity22 conceded was wretched , a sequence of errors — first from @entity95 conceding a corner , then from @entity104 — allowed @entity105 to cause havoc before @entity31 pounced			1
if they are to progress domestically and in @entity109 , they must be more robust			0
‘ we have to defend better , ’ said @entity90			2
‘ just defend — do n’t try and be clever			0
the worst - case scenario when we have days when we are not creative we get a point and move on			0
it ’s disappointing we did n’t			0
’ @entity113 : this was a rare victory for @entity7 ’s defence in front of the @entity118 — the first time in 14 visits that they have kept a clean sheet			1
