who shot the victims , should police have gone in earlier and why did n't authorities negotiate with man @entity4 to release hostages are all questions that will be examined at an inquest into the @entity9 siege in two weeks ' time			1
the @entity11 has fast - tracked the inquiry into the fatal @entity14 cafe stand - off which resulted in the deaths of cafe manager @entity16 , barrister @entity17 and injuries suffered by some of the 18 hostages man @entity21 held for more than 16 hours from the morning of december 15			1
the inquest will open on thursday , january 29 to determine ' how the deaths occurred , the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented ' , a spokesman for the @entity24 @entity23 said			0
however , @entity24 state coroner @entity77 will determine over the next fortnight how large a venue is needed for the number of witnesses required , including lawyers representing victims and police officers			0
following his determination on what happened inside the @entity14 cafe , mr @entity77 will make recommendations to governments and other agencies to protect future public health and safety			0
did he act alone ? man @entity4 ( pictured behind the @entity14 cafe window soon after taking command of the cafe on the morning of december 15 ) may not have been a lone wolf and the coroner will examine if anyone else was involved in planning his deadly attack what happened inside ? the inquest into the siege will find exactly what went on during the 16 hours , how hostages escaped ( pictured ) and why others remained inside until the violent end around 2am on day two these are the questions that the community urgently needs to be answered : 1			1
how did barrister @entity17 die ? reports that the 38 - year - old mother of three died when struck by a police bullet which may have ricochet when the @entity34 officers stormed the cafe will be investigated			2
ms @entity17 reportedly suffered a heart attack , perhaps as a result of bleeding heavily from her wounds			0
how did cafe manager @entity16 die ? the coroner will examine whether mr @entity117 , 34 , was shot from behind by hostage taker man @entity4 's shotgun 3			1
how did man @entity4 die ? the gunman was shot dead by police semi-automatic weapons , but the coroner will examine ballistics to determine how many rounds and from what direction the fatal bullets came			1
who injured the hostages ? four or more of the hostages as well as police suffered injuries including gunshot wounds to the leg and facial wounds , which will come under the investigator 's microscope at the hearing did he intend to die ? speculation has been rife that man @entity4 ( pictured ) planned to die to avoid prison for sexual assault and murder related offences , but the inquest will determine his intent did he have bombs ? after @entity4 wore a supposedly loaded backpack into the @entity14 cafe and told hostages he had planted bombs , explosive experts ( pictured , above ) attended the siege but it is not yet known whether the claims were a hoax 4			1
what caused the injuries of the hostages ? four or more of the hostages as well as police suffered injuries including gunshot wounds to the leg and facial wounds , which will come under the investigator 's microscope at the hearing			0
did the police act properly in holding off , or should they have gone in earlier ? there has been much speculation as to whether @entity24 police commissioner @entity170 's senior command should have stormed the cafe earlier in the siege , whether that would have caused more or less loss of life and if it is true that military troops such as specially trained @entity177 soldiers should have been called into assist			2
were there explosives in the backpack worn by @entity4 and , as he claimed , planted around the cafe and the @entity184 ? and where and how did the gunman obtain the shotgun and any explosives that may have been present ? could lives have been saved ? there has been much speculation as to whether @entity192 should have stormed the cafe earlier in the siege , whether that would have caused more or less loss of life including that of victim @entity17 ( pictured , on the order of service for her funeral ) should troops have been called in ? the inquest should settle whether troops such as the elite trained @entity177 should have been called in to forgo a bloody end for hostages ( pictured ) shot after the 16 hour siege 7			1
did man @entity4 intend to die ? public speculation about gunman @entity4 's intentions , given pending prosecutions against him over sexual assault and murder related charges and a failed court appeal over his hate campaign against @entity218 soldiers appear to have concluded he intended to die in a fainal blaze of ' glory ' in the siege			2
the coroner will examine correspondence and social media posts ot determine @entity4 's intentions			0
should police have responded to @entity4 's demands - for an @entity229 flag and audience with prime minister @entity231 - in exchange for hostages and should offers by @entity236 leaders and lawyers to negotiate with him been accepted ? coroner @entity238 will sift through the facts of the police response to the situation hour by hour until the siege 's end			1
did anyone else know about @entity4 's plans for the siege and is there footage of him casing the premises ? were there other individuals who knew about the siege and who may have helped in planning it ? computer records will help determine whether @entity4 was alone in planning the siege			0
what will the hostages say ? lawyers for the hostages and police involved in the @entity264 siege will pack a courtroom for the inquest into the bloody incident which starts on january 29 and runs for several weeks what are the lessons to be learned ? in the aftermath of the @entity9 siege at @entity264 , many unknowns remained as people paid their respects with flowers ( pictured ) but a public inquest should answer the questions 10			1
what could have been done to prevent the action taken by @entity281 and what lessons can authorities learn to stop another siege in the future ? despite a high security alert by police and other authorities across @entity24 and other states over @entity290 related activities , @entity4 slipped through the net , and the coroner will be looking at what measures - including greater security around public places which do n't have iconic status like the @entity297 or @entity298 - might prevent a repeat incident in the interests of community safety			2
another question is should @entity302 have nabbed @entity4 years ago ? hindsight would say yes , that @entity4 should never have been taken off @entity218 's national security body 's watch list years ago and , much like another @entity308 mullah @entity307 , should have been deported back to his home country			0
although the @entity24 coroner 's findings will feed into the wider investigation , this is a question for a @entity315 inquiry into the siege			0
day one of the inquest will hear from the coroner and counsel assisting , who will outline the specific issues into which the inquiry will delve .			0
