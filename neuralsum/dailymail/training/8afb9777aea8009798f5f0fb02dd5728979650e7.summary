in different circumstances , @entity1 ’s national anthem of choice might have been the land of my fathers , rather than @entity7			1
the talented @entity9 forward has emerged as a key tenet of @entity13 manager @entity12 ’s squad			1
yet , with his father having been born in @entity15 , he had options when it came to his allegiance as a youngster			1
all very topical given the issue which has dominated the build - up to friday ’s @entity23 qualifier between @entity13 and @entity24			1
@entity13 's @entity1 says he could have played for @entity15 as his father was born there @entity26 and @entity27 are @entity28 playing for @entity29			1
@entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 are englishmen playing for @entity13			1
born and reared in @entity35 , however , there was never any genuine prospect of @entity1 accepting the invitation to become the @entity38 who played for @entity15			1
‘ i was playing for @entity13 under - 19s and my father was born in @entity15 , so i could have played for them — but it was n’t something that crossed my mind , ’ revealed the 28 - year - old			1
‘ i was enjoying playing for the under - 19s and growing up it never crossed my mind that i could play for @entity15			1
it was probably brought to my attention by them chancing their arm and thinking it might be an opportunity			2
‘ i always thought about playing at @entity52			2
but do n’t get me wrong – everybody ’s circumstances are different			2
‘ if there ’s a chance for somebody to have an international career and maybe go to a major tournament , would you give that up just because you were n’t born in that country ? ‘ everybody ’s different and so are their circumstances			2
i was fortunate that i had played for @entity13 since i was 17 and everybody knew about that			1
@entity68 ( left ) celebrates with team - mates @entity1 and @entity70 in the game with @entity72 ‘ and i knew if i did well for my club and the international team , i would progress			1
’ it helped that there was no pressure from his father to have a change of heart			2
‘ my @entity80 sees himself as @entity28 , ’ @entity1 explained			1
‘ he was born in @entity15 but he was only there for a few weeks so there was n’t anything to debate			1
’ for others , the decision was less cut and dried			2
the furore over @entity26 and @entity27 has provided the main backdrop to a game dominated by intricate sub-plots and side shows			2
both players were entitled to play for @entity29 by virtue of a grandparent			1
@entity27 , it should be said , was also ignored by the @entity94 for some time — a fact which can hardly be overlooked by prospective boo boys			2
@entity26 qualifies to play for @entity29 through his grandparent most of the @entity101 - born players in the @entity13 squad are also eligible under the grandparent rule			1
were the decision his , @entity1 would draw the line at parents			1
‘ those are the rules so if it can improve your team , and it has improved our team , we ’re happy about it , ’ he continued			2
‘ i personally think there should be a cut - off — not distant relatives			0
but those are the rules at the moment and every country in the world is doing it so i do n’t think there ’s any point in debating it			0
we would n’t have too many complaints about it			0
’ asked if having a @entity28 or @entity130 grandparent is simply too tenuous , the former @entity128 player nodded			0
‘ i think it could get changed a bit to , maybe use the word , tighten it up a bit , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s my view personally			0
then again , who am i ? ’ the subject is never likely to arise in an @entity9 dressing room where some of his closest colleagues play for the @entity24			0
@entity141 will be detailed to mark @entity13 dangerman @entity70 and , in a sobering assessment for those who think home advantage will be enough to beat the @entity130 , @entity1 says of his club - mate : ‘ for me , he ’s the best right - back in @entity147			1
‘ he ’s probably the most down - to - earth guy i ’ve ever met in football and it ’s great to see how he ’s just going to be a superstar			0
@entity141 will be the man tasked with the challenge of marking @entity70 ‘ nothing fazes him			0
he just goes about his business			0
he does everything exactly the same as when he was back in @entity156			0
that ’s a fantastic quality to have			0
‘ he gets everything he deserves because he is such a fantastic player			0
he is so humble and works very hard to get where he is			0
‘ @entity159 ( in midfield ) should n’t be underestimated , either			0
they ’re definitely quality players and they are going to be a threat			0
’ the likelihood is that @entity164 will line up with a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 formation geared towards throttling the life out of @entity13 ’s 4 - 2 - 3 - 1			1
the former @entity169 manager ’s emphasis on set - pieces is also familiar enough to supporters in this country			0
yet @entity1 sees no benefit in dwelling on what @entity29 will do			1
buoyed by the performances in the opening three qualifiers , the striker says @entity13 now have the luxury of concentrating on their own abilities			1
‘ @entity13 is in a fantastic position at the moment , ’ he said			1
‘ what ’s going on is really enjoyable for everyone in the squad and that ’s showing in our performances			0
‘ the manager will highlight what @entity29 ’s positives and weaknesses are			1
but it ’s mainly what we ’re going to do and that ’s the way it should be			0
‘ it ’s the hardest group and we ’ll need to be great all the way to get through , but we ’re capable of it			0
’ highlighted by @entity13 legend @entity197 as a ‘ proper lad ’ who mixes quality with a ferocious work ethic , @entity1 was flattered by the remarks			1
yet he knows , and accepts , there is one area of his game – identified by @entity197 as @entity13 ’s achillies heel - he needs to improve			1
four goals in 31 caps for his country is an improvement on @entity212 ’s one in 16			0
in comparison with @entity216 ’s 65 goals for @entity29 , however , it ’s small beer			2
‘ on the goalscoring , all the forwards are at fault , ’ @entity1 acknowledged			2
‘ i do n’t have a good scoring record for @entity13 and think i should do better			2
‘ fletch is probably the same and i ’m sure @entity68 has said he should score more			0
‘ in this day and age , it ’s not about one guy scoring			0
‘ on the other hand , if we make it to the major tournament and @entity222 has n’t scored a single goal , i wo n’t care as long we ’re there			0
i do n’t think he ’d care , either			0

@entity1 's father was born in @entity15 and the forward could have played for them
@entity1 says he never considered playing for @entity15
@entity29 face @entity13 in the @entity23 qualifier at @entity239
