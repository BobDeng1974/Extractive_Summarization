so naturally president @entity5 was looking forward to getting home to the family			0
making a surprise visit to a @entity9 , where he greeted every person in the place , @entity5 - who briefly lived in the @entity15 borough in his younger days - left with two cheesecakes - one traditional and the other strawberry			1
and he was sure to grab some black - and - white cookies ' for his girls '			1
the check came to $ 73 and he paid with $ 80 cash , according to owner @entity22			1
' he said ( his daughter 's ) were going to eat the cookies on @entity25 on the way back to @entity27 , ' mr @entity22 told @entity28			1
all set : @entity31 president @entity5 walks out with two bags of cheesecake from @entity9 next to @entity34 mayoral candidate @entity2 in @entity4 on friday afternoon ' he greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building ' : onlookers recount @entity5 's visit to a @entity40 's with @entity15 democratic mayoral candidate @entity2 getting around to everyone and then home : @entity5 hugs a young girl in the restaurant before going to see his family ' he greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building , which was quite gracious and amazing to me			1
' literally every single person			0
' it was pretty incredible			0
' the president also left behind a signature on one of the eatery 's large holiday pumpkins			2
@entity4 resident @entity57 said she was enjoying her dinner when the president suddenly walked into the restaurant and could n’t believe her eyes as he walked around the room , hugging people and shaking hands			2
' it was great ! … he said hello to everybody			0
they were hugging him and calling out , ' she said			0
' they applauded him leaving : ‘ thank you for coming			0
we love you ! ’ it was really great			0
' one last thing : president @entity5 leaves behind an autograph on a @entity79 pumpkin before getting his sweets at @entity40 's restaurant in @entity4 friday night crowd : @entity83 were on hand for @entity5 's visit earlier in the day , the president admitted at least two of @entity31 's three branches of government needed to brush up on their math. during a visit to the @entity92 ( p - tech ) in the @entity15 borough of @entity4 , @entity5 observed a level two algebra class , joking that he needed one of the students to help him keep his daughters ' math skills up			1
' the president joked with one of the girls that he needed her to tutor @entity104 and @entity105 , because he 's not very good at helping them with math anymore , ' according to a pool reporter traveling with @entity5			1
@entity104 and @entity105 , the @entity105 ' children , are in the seventh and tenth grades			2
' " i liked math , but then it started to get harder			0
and so that can be frustrating , " the president said , referring to his days as a student , ' the pool report continued			0
but when @entity5 recalled the classroom visit an hour later in his speech to 600 students and teachers , it was @entity120 – not he – who needed help with numbers			0
real world math : @entity5 jokingly solicited math tutors for his kids while admitting that he was no longer up to the task @entity5 's speech at p - tech high school touched on immigration , government budgets and education issues and adulation : @entity5 's job approval ratings nationally are abysmal , but he is still wildly popular in politically stalwart ' blue ' states like @entity15 , where he arrived at @entity135 on friday ' i know that budgets are n't the most interesting topic for a friday afternoon , ' he said while scolding legislators for the recent government shutdown tussle in @entity27 , ' even in a school where young people like math. ' ' and by the way , i just sat in on a lesson called " @entity146 , " which got me thinking whether it 's too late to send @entity120 here for a remedial course			1
' but the president 's ribbing at @entity120 will be quickly forgotten , at least where it concerns those on the political left			2
@entity5 will deliver another speech on friday night – this time to a @entity15 fundraiser for the @entity155 expected to raise up to $ 32,400 per person			1
do n't tell @entity157 : @entity5 tried to help build an " @entity159 " during a math class , but did n't manage to balance his load and the camera - phones come out : @entity4 high - schoolers jostled to get their own photos of the president as he entered the stage			2
