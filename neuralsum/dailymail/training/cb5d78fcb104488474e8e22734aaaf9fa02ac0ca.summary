new evidence showing the level of atmospheric co2 millions of years ago supports recent climate change predictions from the @entity4 , according to research scientists			1
a multinational research team , led by scientists at the @entity8 , has analysed new records showing the @entity11 content of @entity13 's atmosphere between 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago , during the @entity15 era			1
and this data could be used to work out how @entity13 today will react as the climate continues to warm due to human activities			1
they say this data confirms the @entity4 's warnings about our modern climate ( stock image shown ) if @entity11 levels are allowed to continue to rise during the @entity15 , the @entity13 was around 2 ° c warmer than it is today and atmospheric co2 levels were around 350 - 400 parts per million ( ppm ) , similar to the levels reached in recent years			1
by studying the relationship between @entity11 levels and climate change during a warmer period in @entity13 's history , the scientists have been able to estimate how the climate will respond to increasing levels of carbon dioxide , a parameter known as climate sensitivity			1
the @entity15 is particularly useful as it is the last time @entity11 levels on @entity13 were as high as they are today , dr @entity46 , co-author of the study , told @entity51			1
continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long - lasting changes			0
it will increase the likelihood of ' severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems			0
' this includes extreme weather and rising sea levels , heat waves , flooding and droughts			0
@entity66 , which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans , will harm marine life			0
without changes in emissions , ' climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century			0
' at the current rate , by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2 ° @entity76 ) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005			0
by the end of the century , that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 ° c ( 6.7 ° f ) warmer			0
the impact on the @entity13 could already be considered dangerous , the report claims			0
he said the @entity89 ‘ was n’t a tropical paradise , but it certainly had animals and trees , it was a lot warmer back then			2
’ the geological record provides a rich archive that we can dip in to , to see the effects on our planet as the climate continues to warm			2
as the planet warms even further at a rapid rate that can not be attributed to natural processes alone , it will be necessary to go further and further back in time in the geological record			1
for example , 50 million years ago it was 12 ° c warmer than it is today , when there were crocodiles in the @entity89 and sub-tropical forests on @entity107			1
the findings , which have been published in @entity109 , also show how climate sensitivity can vary over the long term			0
dr @entity46 added in a release : ' today the @entity13 is still adjusting to the recent rapid rise of co2 caused by human activities , whereas the longer - term @entity15 records document the full response of co2 - related warming			2
' our estimates of climate sensitivity lie well within the range of 1.5 to 4.5 ° c increase per @entity11 doubling summarised in the latest @entity4 report			2
' this suggests that the research community has a sound understanding of what the climate will be like as we move toward a @entity15 - like warmer future caused by human greenhouse gas emissions			2
' @entity11 levels in the @entity15 - when animals like the sabre - tooth cat @entity136 ( illustrated ) roamed - were similar to the levels now reached			1
at that time the @entity89 was warm enough to have animals and trees			2
and as the climate warms further due to human activity , scientists will look even further back in the geological record the @entity15 is particularly useful as it is the last time @entity11 levels on @entity13 were as high as they are today , now due to man - made emissions ( stock image shown ) , dr @entity46 told @entity51 lead author of the study , dr @entity149 , also from @entity150 said : ' our new records also reveal an important change at around 2.8 million years ago , when levels rapidly dropped to values of about 280ppm , similar to those seen before the @entity159			1
' this caused a dramatic global cooling that initiated the ice - age cycles that have dominated @entity13 's climate ever since			1
' the research team also assessed whether climate sensitivity was different in warmer times , like the @entity15 , than in colder times , like the glacial cycles of the last 800,000 years			2
dr @entity169 , of the @entity170 in @entity171 , said : ' we find that climate change in response to @entity11 change in the warmer period was around half that of the colder period			0
' we determine that this difference is driven by the growth and retreat of large continental ice sheets that are present in the cold ice - age climates ; these ice sheets reflect a lot of sunlight and their growth consequently amplifies the impact of @entity11 changes			0
' dr @entity189 , from the @entity190 , added : ' when we account for the influence of the ice sheets , we confirm that the @entity13 's climate changed with a similar sensitivity to overall [ radiative ] forcing during both warmer and colder climates			1
' according to last year 's @entity4 report , continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long - lasting changes ( some shown on the map )			0
it will increase the likelihood of ' severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems , ' said the report			0

research led by the @entity8 looked at the history of @entity13 's climate 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago in the @entity212 era
they say this data confirms the @entity4 's warnings about our planet
@entity11 levels in the @entity15 were similar to the levels now reached
at that time the @entity89 was warm enough to have animals and trees
and as the climate warms further due to human activity , the scientists say the geological record further back can also predict what will happen
