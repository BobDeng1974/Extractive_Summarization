click here for what sir @entity1 had to say in his update book in defence of @entity7 boss @entity6 's style and how he asked for an explanation of what exactly is the @entity7 way			1
sir @entity1 comments on the ' @entity7 way ' in his updated autobiography and calls the notion held dear by fans a myth			1
he writes : ' i hope that before i die someone can explain the ' @entity7 way '			2
' what is it ? they last won a trophy in 1980 , the @entity21			0
' @entity22 asked @entity23 of @entity7 fan website @entity25 for his reaction to @entity1 's comments and to meet the former @entity30 manager 's request			1
sir @entity1 's mocking of the ' @entity7 way ' is more about selling his book than it is supporting his old mate @entity6			1
he is being controversial for the sake of it to gain free publicity and to support his habit of buying expensive wine for his luxury cellar collection			0
@entity1 has a very short memory ; the @entity7 way was beating @entity30 4 - 0 on a snowy december night in 2010 when @entity41 and @entity42 were the unlikely heroes , scoring two goals apiece			1
sir @entity1 ( right ) defends @entity6 ( left ) and says the ' @entity7 way ' is a myth in his book for me , the ' @entity7 way ' is about attacking football ; going out to attack the opposition at all times , trying to score at every opportunity , never sitting back in an attempt to frustrate , but instead going for the jugular regardless of whether you 're home or away			1
a fundamental part of the ' @entity7 way ' is central defenders bringing the ball out from the back			2
that started with @entity7 and @entity60 legend @entity59 , and continued through @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			2
we also had attacking full backs who would overlap and get forward , best exemplified by @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			0
@entity7 's @entity41 celebrates his first of two goals in their 2010 win over @entity30 @entity42 was the other hero that night with a double in their 4 - 0 @entity78 demolition of @entity30 the cavalier style of the ' @entity7 way ' made us vulnerable and is one of the reasons we used to concede so many goals - even with @entity59 in the centre of defence			1
this season many @entity7 fans will say the ' @entity7 way ' has returned			2
new signings @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 have added a dimension we have lacked in recent seasons under @entity6			0
this new injection of pace , skill and quality , together with excellent form of @entity101 and @entity102 , has made @entity7 a joy to watch again and is a major reason why we are fourth in the @entity105			0
in form @entity101 ( left ) and new sensation @entity90 ( right ) are showing the way for @entity7 @entity90 cracks an audacious shot to equalise against @entity110 in a hard - fought 2 - 2 draw but the @entity7 way is not all about results			0
as @entity7 we enjoyed the hard - fought 2 - 2 draw at @entity110 and the narrow 2 - 1 defeat at @entity116			0
in both those matches we gave it a go and tried our best			0
no false nines or 11 men behind the ball - we went for it - and that is what we will expect on saturday lunchtime as we face second - placed @entity127 at home			0
the @entity7 way is fundamental to the club 's identity			1
@entity131 and @entity60 manager @entity132 eloquently explained the @entity7 way in 1977 when he said : ' the crowds at @entity7 have n't been rewarded by results but keep turning up because of the good football they see			2
@entity1 pointed out that @entity7 's last major trophy came in 1980 , when they won the @entity21 ' other clubs will suffer from the old bugbear that results count more than anything			1
this has been the ruination of @entity145 football			0
' i am happy to give @entity1 an explanation of the @entity7 way ! maybe now he will concentrate more on the mess he left behind at @entity30 when he retired and leave the comments about @entity7 and their style of play out of further updates of his book			1
@entity23 writes for @entity155 and @entity156 and @entity157			2
he is the @entity158 presenter .			0

sir @entity1 said the ' @entity7 way ' is a myth in his updated book
the former @entity30 manager also defended @entity6
@entity164 's @entity23 explains the ' @entity7 way '
he writes : ' the @entity7 way is fundamental to the club 's identity '
