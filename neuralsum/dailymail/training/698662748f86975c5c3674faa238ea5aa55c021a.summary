by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:20 est , 22 august 2012 updated : 01:44 est , 23 august 2012 ministers should do more to ensure that recipients of @entity6 aid money do more to collect their own taxes properly , mps said last night			1
the @entity8 said that if poorer nations collected their own taxes effectively , they would not have to rely on @entity6 taxpayers quite so much			1
they said a reliable flow of tax revenues offered countries a far better route out of poverty than reliance on foreign aid donations			1
@entity19 war widows line up to receive monthly ration in @entity21			1
the @entity8 said that if poorer nations collected their own taxes effectively , they would not have to rely on foreign aid the @entity2 urged the @entity23 to support the revenue authorities in developing nations to improve the collection rates of income tax , vat and local property taxes			1
while most government departments have had to endure severe cuts , but @entity23 is enjoying increases to take its budget up to 0.7 per cent of gdp			1
@entity8 chairman sir @entity34 said : ' the aim of development work is to enable developing countries to escape from over-reliance on aid			1
' supporting revenue authorities is one of the best ways of doing this : it represents excellent value for money , both for the countries concerned and for @entity6 taxpayers			1
' the committee said it was essential that the governing ' elites ' within developing countries paid - and , critically , were seen to pay - the correct amounts in personal taxation			1
' tax is an issue of fundamental importance for development , ' its report said			2
' if developing countries are to escape from aid dependency , and from poverty more broadly , it is imperative that their revenue authorities are able to collect taxes effectively			2
' but the @entity2 said efforts to improve tax collection were hampered by new treasury rules for multinational companies which give them an incentive to shift profits into tax havens			2
recent changes to so - called ' controlled foreign companies ' rules mean that less tax money will flow into the coffers of developing countries			2
one aid agency , @entity76 , has estimated that it could cost developing countries up to Â£ 4billion in lost tax revenues , and the committee said the government should consider reversing the changes ' as a matter of urgency '			0
recent changes to so - called ' controlled foreign companies ' rules mean that less tax money will flow into the coffers of developing countries sir @entity34 said : ' the government is committed to supporting economic growth in developing countries to reduce their dependency on aid			0
while this is clearly the right thing to do , it would be deeply unfortunate if the government 's efforts were undermined by its own tax rules			0
' the report said that ministers should introduce rules requiring companies to publish financial information on a country - by - country basis to discourage cross-border tax evasion			0
so far the government has been reluctant to act unless other @entity104 countries are prepared to follow suit , but the @entity2 said @entity6 should now be prepared to go it alone			0
@entity107 , @entity76 's head of policy , said : ' tax avoidance is now a major global concern , and the @entity6 needs to take into account the impact of its own tax regime on the world 's poorest countries			0
' this lost revenue could enable poor countries to put more teachers in schools and nurses in hospitals , as well as ultimately helping end aid dependency			0
' a spokesman for the @entity124 said the controlled foreign company rules were there to protect @entity6 tax revenues and were not designed to protect those of other countries			0
the changes were designed to encourage investment and drive growth in the @entity6			0
' it is not sustainable for developing countries to protect their revenue using our tax rules , a much better way is to build their capacity and capability to collect the tax that they are due , ' he said .			0
