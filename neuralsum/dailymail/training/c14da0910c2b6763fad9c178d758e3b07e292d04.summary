a top general warned on monday that planned reductions in the size of military could have a harmful effect on the @entity6 ' ability to fight the @entity7 and counter @entity9 's aggression in @entity10			1
the military has already cut its active duty forces from a peak of 570,000 down to 510,000 troops			1
budget reductions approved in 2011 call for troop numbers to fall to 490,000			1
automatic spending cuts associated with sequestration could bring that number down to as few as 420,000 troops			1
chief of staff to the @entity24 gen. @entity23 said at a news conference on monday that he was uncomfortable about a potential reduction in forces because of the threats to the @entity6 and it 's hegemony from around the globe			1
' the world is changing in front of us			2
we have seen @entity9 aggression in @entity10 , we have seen @entity36 , we have seen increased stability in other places , ' gen. @entity23 said , according to the @entity39			1
@entity23 said monday that proposed cuts to the military 's budget and size would undercut the @entity6 ' ability to defeat @entity36 and counter @entity9 in @entity10 ' so i now have concern whether even going below 490,000 is the right thing to do or not , because of what i see potentially on the horizon			1
' @entity23 was speaking at an @entity24 event when he levied the complaint			1
it 's not the first time the retiring general has spoken up in the last few weeks about his concerns that cuts to the military are becoming too drastic , and he 's not the only military expert who is apprehensive about the curtailment			2
former vice president @entity63 , who is also a former secretary of defense , has vocally opposed the shrinkage			0
' i think we 're entering a period of considerable danger with the @entity6 that relative to other nations is weaker than we oughta be , ' he told @entity71 's @entity70 over the weekend			0
speaking broadly about the @entity72 , @entity63 said it would be ' crazy ' to ' look at that part of the world and think we can hide behind our ocean			0
' ' you got ta be a fool to believe isolationist strategy is the way to go , ' he said			0
' we have no choice to be involved in that part of the world , and if we 're not actively involved , some very bad things are gon na happen , ' he forewarned			0
he later argued that ' this is not the time for us to rest on our laurels ' and cut the defense budget			2
@entity91 soldiers inspect the site of a car bomb attack in @entity95 district , northeast of @entity96 on monday			0
local media reports said at least 30 people were killed and dozens others were wounded in two car bombings			0
the attacks came as the @entity6 has slowed the number of bombs its dropping on @entity36 in @entity91 smoke rises from the @entity106 town of @entity107 , seen from near the @entity109 border crossing on the @entity111 - @entity106 border on monday			2
the @entity6 and it 's allies have dropped 21 bombs in @entity106 in the last days in an effort to slow down the @entity7 's advances there at a breakfast with reporters last month @entity23 cautioned that if the $ 9 billion in spending cuts included in sequestration are allowed to kick in , the number of active duty soldiers will drop to 420,000 in 2016			1
that would put the @entity6 at ' significant risk , ' he said , and called fiscal year 2016 ' the breaking point ' for the military			2
the agreement to cut troops was made before fighting broke out in @entity91 and @entity130 , he argued , and it is ill - advised now in light of more recent threat assessments			2
' the risk has actually increased			0
the potential to have ground forces operating on multiple continents simultaneously causes me grave concern about the size of the military , and i think we have to review it , ' @entity23 said , per @entity142			1
cuts to the military 's budget would bring about ' a significant degradation of readiness , ' he explained , and some brigades would n't be able to complete the necessary training to be battle - ready			1
' i ’m not seeing , in ‘ 16 , peace breaking out all over the world , ' he noted			0
@entity152 reports that @entity23 also told reporters that @entity6 combat forces may be needed in @entity91			1
' airstrikes have slowed the advances of [ @entity36 ] , ' @entity23 said , according to @entity157			2
' but airstrikes alone wo n’t defeat [ @entity36 ]			0
' you need a complementary ground capability that will go in and do that			0
' asked if he would recommend the use of @entity6 ground forces if it comes down to it , @entity23 said , ' i never rule anything out			1
' @entity167 has explicitly promised not put troops back into positions of combat in @entity91 , regardless of what happens , even as top generals like @entity23 and @entity173 chairman @entity174 have suggested that circumstances may arise in which they would advise him otherwise			1
the @entity6 has had to slow its air campaign in @entity91 as @entity36 has changed its patterns and methods to avoid being bombed			0
in the last two days the @entity6 and its allies have launched only one airstrike in @entity91 , @entity180 said in a statement , compared to the 21 bombs they dropped on targets in @entity106 , where fighting has spread in recent weeks to just a mile outside the border with @entity111			0
on monday @entity23 said he was glad he was to be stepping down at @entity24 chief of staff in a few months so he did n't have to be responsible for deploying troops who are n't prepared to fight			1
' i swore that i would never send soldiers into a place not properly prepared , trained or equipped , ' he reportedly said			0
' i will probably get away with that because i will leave … by the beginning of the next year			0
' but i worry for the next chief , ' he added .			0
