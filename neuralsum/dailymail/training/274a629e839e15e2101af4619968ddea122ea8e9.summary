@entity0 planned to give his 13 - year - old niece a @entity2 for @entity3 , so he went to a @entity4 last friday to buy one			1
the employee who assisted him at the store took the gaming console out of a locked cabinet and told him it was previously returned , @entity0 told @entity10			1
the associate mentioned to him the box felt heavy , but at the time @entity0 felt there was nothing strange about that since he 'd never bought one before and would n't know how much it weighs			0
' just to make sure everything was inside , that all the contents were inside , all the games were inside , ' he said			0
' when i opened it , i said , " @entity31			0
" ' instead of the console , inside the box were two bags filled with small rocks that had been duct taped closed			2
the original store was closed by then , and @entity0 was also turned away at a 24 - hour @entity4			1
he returned to the store he purchased the rock - filled box from saturday morning			2
' he said they can not do anything about it because they do n't have proof , how it came in , nothing , ' @entity0 said about trying to return the console , which starts at $ 399 at the retail chain			1
' i never stole anything in my life			0
the most criminal thing that i 've did , i got a driving ticket , ' he added			0
stuck : @entity0 says he tried to return the console for an exchange or a refund , but was told @entity4 could n't verify they had sold him the rocks deceptive : the sales associate that retrieved the @entity58 bundle for @entity0 said it felt heavy , but the man did n't question what he thought was the console 's normal weight he tried to call the story and @entity4 's corporate office , to no avail			1
then on christmas eve , he caught a break when a store manager phoned him , saying he could bring the box back to the store and refunded the money @entity0 paid			2
a spokesperson for @entity4 told @entity73 there was no way to verify the man 's story , but they wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt			1
@entity0 joked that if he had n't checked the box before wrapping it , there would have been some tears , from both himself and his niece			0
technology - related @entity3 scams happen nearly every year , with criminals exhibiting varying degrees of creativity			2
in 2005 , one boy who thought he was getting an @entity92 video instead unwrapped a sealed piece of mystery meat in an @entity96 box , @entity89 reported .			0

@entity0 was giving his 13 - year - old niece a @entity2 *bybdke* for @entity3
he purchased a console at @entity4 , where it retails starting at $ 399 , and later opened it to find two bags of rocks
the store he purchased it from was *unwilling* to exchange or return the console because they had no proof about the condition it was sold in
finally , a manager agreed to give @entity0 the benefit of the doubt and exchange fake console
