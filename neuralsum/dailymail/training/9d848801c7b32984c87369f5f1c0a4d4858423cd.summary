former @entity11 ranger @entity10 using his trusty @entity14 rifle he nicknamed ‘ @entity18 ’ to blast insurgents to death during the @entity17			1
he was so possessive over ‘ his girl ’ as he called the gun , that he hated it when other men touched her and would spend four hours a night painting her			2
before every battle he would get pumped up to the sounds of men zipping their gear up with @entity29 , which he likened to music being played to a high school football team			2
@entity0 was trained to become a sniper by his superiors who told him that it was the biggest thrill of your life and that ' once you kill a man , you ca n’t replace that feeling			1
' he has told of his career in a book published just weeks after the release of ‘ @entity43 ’ , the film about the life of @entity46 , the most deadly sniper in @entity48 history			1

in @entity57 ’s memoir , extracts of which were published in the @entity58 , he tells how he became the first black sniper in the @entity11 ’s @entity60 , which had previously fought in the ‘ @entity63 ’ incident in @entity62			1
he was the son of two enlisted soldiers in @entity65 , @entity66 , but did n’t want to be in the @entity11 until he got curious about weapons as a teenager			1

you wo n’t find any joy in it			2
once you kill a man , you ca n’t replace that feeling			0
’ memories : @entity0 released his memoir ( book cover above ) about his sniper days just a few weeks after the debut of film @entity43 , which follows the life of @entity46 , the deadliest sniper in @entity48 military history @entity0 ’s first kill came outside of @entity113 when he was on the .50 caliber machine gun in a convoy of @entity117 armored vehicles			1
a car drove past them , stopped and drove towards them at speed			0
@entity0 ’s supervisor said : ‘ take him out ’			1
@entity0 writes that he fired seven rounds and said : ‘ i saw something explode inside the car			1
it was n’t an @entity128 , it was the man inside it			0
he turned into mist and chunks			0
’ his comrades shouted ‘ yeah ! ’ and ‘ @entity135 ’			0
@entity0 was stunned that it could be that easy but writes that he was haunted what he had done that later that night the man he shot ‘ returned to me ’ in a nightmare			1
he writes : ‘ i had a dream where i was in a room with a ceiling fan spinning above me			0
‘ the blades of the fan were the man ’s four limbs plus his head and chest			0
he was staring at me with that same dead - eyed stare , but as the fan spun faster and faster , he started screaming at me open - mouthed			0
‘ eventually the fan got spinning so fast that his limbs were whipped off and he sprayed the room with blood and guts , covering me as well with gelatinous goo			0
’ according to @entity0 , the tiniest thing can scupper a sniper ’s shot including having the wrong ladder			1
he had a telescoping ladder and recounts how on one occasion he had to put it near vertical to get him high enough to see the target from the top			0
after shooting the man dead - he turned out to be a suicide bomber - his supervisor told him : the first : @entity0 became the first black sniper of the @entity11 's @entity60			1
the battalion previously fought in the @entity173 , also known as @entity63 ‘ the hollow point expanded and pushed everything up and out of his chest			0
‘ his heart was hanging there on the outside of his body cavity , still pumping a couple of times , spraying the tree and leaves			0
’ @entity0 is his most poetic when talking about what it ’s like to actually pull the trigger			2
he writes : ‘ i squeezed the trigger and experienced that slow - motion effect			0
‘ the smell of the gas burning out of the suppressor mixed with the sweet smell of the gun oil i use			0
my eye still focused on the crosshairs in the center of the scope , i watched as the man collapsed , almost as if he were a balloon being popped			0
’ and speaking about his love of @entity29 , he said : ‘ i do n’t know what the military did before it was invented			0
hearing 35 or so guys strapping stuff on with that simple hook and loop mechanism , the sound of tape being unrolled as guys secure things to keep as silent as possible , was like the music we ’d play in the locker room ( in high school ) before a game to get pumped up			0
that collective sound signaled that we all had each other ’s back			0
’ nightmares : @entity0 says he now sleeps with a pistol under his pillow or on the nightstand next to his wife @entity224 @entity0 , who now runs a training site in @entity86 and blogs on special forces website @entity228 , said that he was not the same after the war and once stole a bottle of gatorade from a supermarket without realizing			1
he also still sleeps with a pistol under his pillow or on a nightstand next to his wife , @entity224			0
@entity0 ’s life mirrors that of @entity46 who before his death in 2013 notched up his record number of kills during the @entity72 war			1
he became so feared by insurgents they put a $ 80,000 bounty on his head and nicknamed him @entity245 , or ‘ the @entity246 ’			2
in one battle alone he shot dead 40 enemy soldiers although his greatest achievement was his longest kill - from a staggering 1.2 miles away			2
