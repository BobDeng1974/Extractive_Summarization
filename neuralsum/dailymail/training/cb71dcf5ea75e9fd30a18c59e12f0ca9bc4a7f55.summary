by @entity0 published : 01:46 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 07:32 est , 21 january 2014 considering they included mustard gas and trench foot , the dangers to soldiers in the @entity4 were all too obvious			0
but their wives and daughters hardly lived comfortably either - toiling on dangerous machines and making deadly materials such as asbestos to keep the nation from grinding to a halt			2
a new exhibition reveals a very human side to the war effort - showing women smiling as they drink tea and carry tyres and rolled glass			2
life during wartime : striking new images of women working during the @entity4 have gone on display at the @entity27 in @entity28			1
@entity30 , workers stack thousands of oil cakes in a @entity33 factory in 1918 , while women use a grain elevator at the mills of @entity37 and sons in @entity39 , right heavy load : left , a woman working in the @entity43 and @entity38 rubber factory in @entity28 , and another , right , carrying a piece of rolled glass at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48			1
the huge prints are made from images taken by @entity51 , an official photographer of the @entity52 who specialised in heavy industry fancy a cuppa ? images like this one of women having a break in an @entity33 oil factory are on giant outdoor prints , pictured right with museum employee @entity60 the striking images were taken by @entity51 , an official photographer of the @entity52 who specialised in photographing women workers in the glass , vehicle and food factories which spread across @entity66			1
they were taken in the industrial heartlands of the north of @entity70 , from @entity33 to @entity48 , showing women manufacturing everything from grain to oil cakes probably used in animal feed			1
the exhibition at the @entity27 in @entity28 is designed to show how life during wartime shaped the society in which we live today			1
part of the centenary of the @entity4 this year , the outdoor exhibition features vast 16ft high black and white prints outside the museum 's main entrance			2
visitors can explore a recreated trench to the sounds of war along with soldiers whispering , singing and even frying bacon			0
they can also sit at an interactive table which shows how food reached soldiers fighting in @entity97			0
towering : the 16ft high black and white prints have gone on display at the @entity27 in @entity28 in tribute to women who worked on the @entity52 food for thought : a man looks at one of the images , which shed light on an often unreported side of the @entity4 while soldiers were serving in the trenches danger : although the peril to soldiers abroad was more obvious , those back home faced hazards too			1
pictured left , women worked in a factory in @entity33 making asbestos , a cheap and versatile fireproofing material which it would later be proved caused a devastating form of aggressive cancer			1
the exhibition runs until september @entity51 , the photographer , was known for his spontaneous and human style which contrasted with the staged , formal photos by @entity126			2
although conditions were terrible , the poverty of early 20th century @entity66 meant it was better for many soldiers in the @entity130 than it was back home			0
for one thing , they would be guaranteed a daily meal with meat , a rarity if they were with their families			0
meanwhile for those left back home , the reverberations of the war would be felt in ways which few would have predicted - it arguably hastened the cause of women 's rights			0
wives who had spent their whole lives at home were suddenly empowered and doing the jobs only their husbands would have done before			0
if they could work like men , some thought , why not be treated on the same level ? most women were granted the vote in 1918 , the year the war ended - although it took another 10 years before the right would be extended to those under 30			0
the exhibition at @entity27 , @entity28 , runs until september 28 .			1
