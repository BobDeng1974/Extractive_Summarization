a patent has been approved that could see @entity6 tracking , and making money from , the eye movements of its @entity2 owners			1
the @entity9 patent shows the device tracking where the wearer looks , how long they look at an item , and even how much their pupils dilate			1
information about where the user is looking could then be sent to @entity6 's servers where an image scanning algorithm would identify what they are looking at , create a log of everything they 've viewed , and potentially use this information to serve adverts			1
it could potentially track how long a user looks at an item as well as pupil dilation			1
images would then be sent to a server and kept in a viewing history before being used to show adverts on the device 's screen , pictured consumers might need to buy bigger and faster mobile price plans in order to feed data - hungry devices like @entity2 , according to experts			1
@entity46 technology guru @entity45 predicts wearable devices like @entity2 will be expensive for consumers as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by wireless carriers and users will have to upgrade their data plans			1
it is believed the device will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity			0
the patent reads : ' eye tracking systems use cameras to measure eye movement / position to determine the point of gaze ( i.e. , where you are looking )			0
' @entity67 have been used in human computer interaction systems , psychology , and other research field endeavors			0
' there are a number of techniques to measure eye movement including video images from which eye position can be determined			0
' to date , eye tracking systems have mostly been limited to research endeavors because of the intrusiveness , high cost , and reliability of these systems			0
' a technique and system that can provide a reliable , low cost , and unobtrusive , eye tracking system could have a variety of useful everyday applications			0
' tracking sensors would be attached to the small screen that sits above the wearer 's right eye			2
the camera on the right arm of the device could be used to record the adverts and where the wearer gazes			1
@entity6 could then potentially show adverts on the built - in screen			1
for example , if someone gazes at a sandwich being eaten by another person , @entity6 could show adverts for nearby restaurants or cafes			1
@entity6 could also measure how long people gaze at traditional adverts such as billboards , magazines and newspapers and send viewing figures to advertisers			1
it could also use this method to create a log of products that the wearer likes in order to make the on - screen adverts more personalised			2
tracking sensors would be attached to the small screen that sits above the wearer 's eye , on the left - hand side of this image , to measure position of the eye and pupil dilation			1
the camera on the right arm could then capture what the wearer is looking at as explained in the patent : ' under a pay per gaze advertising scheme , advertisers are charged based upon whether a user actually viewed their advertisement			2
' pay per gaze advertising need not be limited to on - line advertisements , but rather can be extended to conventional advertisement media including billboards , magazines , newspapers , and other forms of conventional print media			0
' the patent does continue that the feature could be opted out of and that users would have control over what information is collected			0
it also details that any personal data would be removed before information is sent to advertisers			0
commenting on the news , @entity156 from @entity157 said : ' debate at this stage is premature			0
the patent , for one , filed in 2011 , never mentions @entity2 , only with reference to a head - mounted gaze tracking device			2
' most important , this is a patent , not a product announcement			0
patents at times do develop into real products and services but others do not			0
@entity171 will tell if this patent evolves into advertising 's new relationships with @entity2			2

approved patent could allow @entity6 track where @entity2 users look
motion sensors track pupil dilation and how long a wearer gazes at an item
image *recognition* can then identify items and store viewing history
adverts could be shown that relate to what people are looking at
