the @entity17 rowing society are to release their 2015 nude calender despite heavy controversy surrounding their shoot last year which sure the images banned from @entity3 however the social networking site said that the photos breached their ' pornographic and nudity ' laws and removed the black - and - white nude photos - claiming it contained ' explicitly sexual content '			1
despite last year 's controversy the women have remained undeterred and have released images from their 2015 calender containing even more naked images of the rowers claiming it is their best calender yet			1
featuring 12 members of the university 's rowing club , the girls - aged between 18 and 21 - can be seen frolicking in their boat house on the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46			0

the girls have raised over £ 3000 for the charity with their previous calendar sales ' we were all disappointed when the page was removed because we are students so social media is one of the main ways we market and advertise the calendar			0
' it really hurt us when it was branded as porn because that is exactly the opposite of what we want to do			0
' we are all strong - minded women and our first thought is to make sure the shots are tastefully done so it makes a calendar we can all be proud of			2
' despite not being able to market the calendar on @entity3 the girls have received 200 pre-orders from around the globe @entity50 admits that they did have their concerns regarding marketing the calendar without the help of social media , but says that they have already received a phenomenal response			1
' we have raised over £ 3,000 for @entity15 and thought we might struggle to sell as many of the 2015 calendars without @entity3			1
' thankfully , due to the support of our loyal fans , they saw sense and put the page back up again and the girls are really looking forward to selling as many as we can to our fans all over the world			0
' the society have received an order all the way from @entity115 from the @entity68 @entity50 added that the warm weather really helped the girls to relax in their photographs and produce some of their most successful images yet			0
' this year 's shoot was done in june at our boat hose at @entity45 along the beautiful @entity44 when we had some amazing hot weather			1
' the girls really got into the spirit and i think the final images make this our best ever calendar			2
