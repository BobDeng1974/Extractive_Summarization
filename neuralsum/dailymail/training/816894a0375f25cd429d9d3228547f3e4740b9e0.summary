prediction : @entity1 , chairman of the @entity2 between 1987 and 2006 , expects @entity3 to default on its debts and leave the euro @entity3 will be forced to leave the eurozone , the former head of the @entity9 central bank @entity1 predicted yesterday			1
mr @entity1 warned that he could not see anyone willing to offer loans to the country			1
@entity13 has until the end of the month to secure around £ 5billion of financing to keep the @entity3 economy running			2
failure to do so would cause the nation to default on its debts and pull out of the single currency , the former @entity2 chairman said			0
but the country ’s far - left @entity22 party has vowed to ditch austerity , setting the nation on a collision course with the rest of the single currency bloc			1
new prime minister @entity28 has pledged to write off some of the country ’s debts and renegotiate the terms of its £ 185billion bailout package — a deal that @entity35 has already said is ‘ too generous ’			1
mr @entity1 told the @entity36 yesterday : ‘ @entity3 ’s position is if they do n’t get additional loans they will default and leave the @entity41			1
‘ i do n’t see any people willing to put in their funds having been disappointed so often			0
’ he added : ‘ all the cards are being held by the members of the eurozone			2
’ @entity1 was the chairman of the @entity2 , the @entity9 central bank , between 1987 and 2006			2
his dire assessment comes as @entity49 warned that @entity3 leaving the euro would cause ‘ real ructions ’ in the @entity52 economy			0
the chancellor said : ‘ this stand - off between @entity3 and the eurozone is increasing the risk every day to the @entity52 economy			1
‘ @entity3 has worked hard to stay in the eurozone , and frankly a @entity3 exit from the eurozone in my view would have very serious consequences			1
’ the chancellor will today fly to @entity66 for a meeting of the @entity69 finance ministers , with the economic crisis facing the eurozone high on the agenda			0
there is an @entity75 summit later this week , and on wednesday next week the @entity76 will vote on whether to extend loans to @entity3			0
@entity3 ’s bailout is arranged by a trio of lenders , called the @entity81 – the @entity76 , the @entity75 and the @entity82			1
@entity35 ’s finance minister @entity83 last week said that the package that was already agreed was ‘ generous beyond all measure , ’ in a sign that @entity87 ’s richest nation would be unwilling to give ground to @entity3			2
in spite of the parlous state of the country ’s finances , his policies include free electricity for poorer citizens and hiking the minimum wage			1
he will meet @entity75 leaders in a summit in @entity112 on thursday to set out his demands			0
but mr @entity1 warned that @entity3 ’s exit would be ‘ miniscule ’ compared to the effect of the @entity116 breaking apart – something that he thinks is inevitable			1
he warned that @entity3 could be forced out of the single currency bloc – the first country to leave			2
this would lead to others following , and could eventually see the @entity116 split in two , with the richer @entity124 nations divided from the @entity126 countries			0
he added : ‘ i believe [ @entity3 ] will eventually leave			0
i do n’t think it helps them or the rest of the eurozone , it is just a matter of time before everyone recognises that parting is the best strategy			0
‘ the problem is that there is no way that i can conceive of the euro of continuing , unless and until all of the members of eurozone become politically integrated - actually even just fiscally integrated wo n’t do it			0
