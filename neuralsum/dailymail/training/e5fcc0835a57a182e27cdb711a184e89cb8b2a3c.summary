@entity0 has his sights set on winning a sixth world title – because he feels he has discovered a cure for his deteriorating eyesight			1
for many darts players , who sometimes compete around the country on poorly - lit stages , ever - decreasing vision is what usually curtails a career			1
senior pros like 16 - time world champion @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have complained in recent years that as they have got older their ability to focus on the dartboard has gradually got worse			1
@entity0 is ready to fight for his @entity18 title this year at @entity19 like them , @entity0 was concerned at the start of this year about properly being able to see the doubles and trebles			1
but last month , after a quick @entity27 search , the @entity25 ace chanced upon the ' @entity28 ' , an alternative therapy aimed at improving quality of vision			1
after a few weeks of intense ' palm therapy ' he says his eyes have improved so impressively that he has cancelled his laser surgery appointment in the @entity35			2
and , as a result , he is confident his healing hands will be holding aloft the @entity38 on january 4			2
@entity39 produced a strong showing against @entity42 - @entity41 on monday in the first round @entity0 , whose last world title was in 2007 , said : ' @entity45 often struggle with their eyes because of the light and the stress of playing every single week			1
' i noticed that my eyes were getting bad because of my diabetes but i do n't like playing with glasses			2
' so , i went on @entity27 the other day and found something about " palming "			2
basically you rub the palms of your hand together until they get extremely warm			2
the @entity25 six - time world champion has found a method that helps him to improve his eyesight @entity39 had been struggling with his eyesight and was going to have laser surgery in the new year ' then you place your palms on your eyes to warm them up			1
if you sit like this for ten minutes , you 'll have better vision			0
i 'm doing it twice a day – morning and night			0
' i had known about this for two years but i was too lazy to do it			0
i do it ten minutes in the morning or before i go to sleep			0
and my vision is fine now			0
' trust me i already had an appointment on january 16 to laser my eyes because these are my working tool , they have to be right			0
you ca n't have blurred vision			0
but i have now cancelled my appointment because i am fine			0
' @entity0 , who smashed debutant @entity42 - @entity41 in the first round with a 125.25 average in the third set , faces @entity83 in the second round on monday evening			1
he added : ' if i believe in myself , if i play like i did in the first round , then anything is possible			0
