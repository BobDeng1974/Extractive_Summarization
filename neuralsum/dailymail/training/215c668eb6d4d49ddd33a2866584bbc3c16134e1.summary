by @entity0 it was rather fitting that the first coach to use the @entity4 drinks break to dramatic effect was @entity6 of @entity7			1
@entity8 is what is known as a game - changer			2
that is the role @entity13 have set out for him , as the successor to the forlorn @entity16			1
they want the new coach to arrest last season 's decline , to rebuild sir @entity22 's team and restore the club to the pinnacle of @entity26 football			2
yet @entity8 is a game - changer in a literal sense , too			2
he intervenes , he inspires , he diverts the course of the matches his teams play			0
there is a lazy presumption in the @entity26 game that once the team enter the field there is little the manager can do about proceedings			0
he certainly did in @entity58 on sunday			0
in searing heat , the most hostile conditions of the @entity4 so far , he used the opportunity of a second - half drinks break to alter @entity7 's shape against @entity35			1
he took off @entity38 and replaced him with @entity64 - @entity65 ; he moved @entity66 from left wing back to a supporting striker role ; he went long on his route to goal			0
the @entity72 decision was brave			2
this is , after all , his captain and the player who it is said will smooth his path at @entity13 next summer			2
@entity8 needs @entity72 to help sell his often - confrontational style and methods to the rest of the dressing room			1
yet it was the direct approach in moving the ball forward that was his greatest risk			0
already derided by the grandees of @entity43 football , including @entity87 , had @entity8 played in a less sophisticated way in the final minutes against @entity35 and lost , he would have been decried as a philistine			1
instead , the end justified the means			0
@entity35 wilted under the pressure , @entity7 won , @entity8 's intervention was successful			1
it is this decisiveness that @entity13 are hoping to bottle next season , having faltered under @entity16 , who seemed to struggle with the big calls			1
@entity16 failed to replace @entity72 during a poor performance against @entity97			1
' if i 'd brought him off some people would say , " what are you doing ? you are 1 - 0 down and you 're taking off your top goalscorer " , ' @entity16 admitted			2
feeling down : @entity16 looks dejected on the sidelines as he sees @entity13 lose again making a difference : @entity8 gives instructions as @entity7 came from behind to win famous pose : @entity13 were known for stunning late comebacks in sir @entity22 's time at the club it is unlikely @entity8 would ever factor public reaction into a decision			1
' this trainer wants to win , ' he said after the match in @entity58			0
' he makes the changes and the substitutions he needs			0
' he says he will have no qualms about dropping @entity72 entirely if he feels fitness issues have affected the performances of his captain			2
the way football is developing , @entity8 's hands - on approach is more important than ever			0
@entity65 's injury - time winner from the penalty spot was the 25th goal scored at this @entity4 by a substitute			1
the ratio going into monday 's fixtures was a goal in every 2.08 games from a player coming off the bench , meaning football can no longer be considered 11 against 11			0
at @entity143 in particular , when a coach has 12 options on the sideline , game management is vital			0
as rugby union has its invasion of replacements in the second half , baseball its relief pitchers to close out the match , and hockey its rolling substitutes , so football is increasingly demanding of the coaches			0
one of the reasons @entity155 grew dissatisfied with @entity156 was his substitutions			0
in these days of constant statistical analysis , it was noted that almost a season had passed without any of the players he had introduced scoring , or creating , a goal			0
@entity165 is regarded as one of the most inspired game managers in football and @entity8 is the coach who he says was his greatest influence			0
@entity22 , the man whose feats the @entity43 must aspire to as @entity13 manager , was never shy of the bold gesture either			1
in this way , already , @entity8 seems a more natural fit than the instinctively cautious @entity16			1
@entity13 fell behind 20 times and recovered to win on four occasions under @entity16			1
by contrast , @entity7 have come back from behind three times already just at this @entity4			1
it would appear @entity13 have found their man			0
famous pose : @entity13 were known for stunning late comebacks in sir @entity22 's time at the club			1

@entity7 win in @entity22 time with a *controversial* penalty
@entity43 come from behind three times in four games at the @entity4 to win
@entity13 came from behind to win on just four of twenty occasions under @entity16
@entity8 hooks captain @entity72 while @entity16 always remained fearful
