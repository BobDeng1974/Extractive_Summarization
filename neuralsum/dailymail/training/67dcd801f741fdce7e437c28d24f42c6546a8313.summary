by @entity0 for @entity1 if there 's one thing the internet does well , it 's videos of cats doing funny things			2
@entity9 has embraced people 's obsession with cat videos and created their own video series where cats run a fictional store called @entity16			1
the webisodes star four felines who run @entity16 and show each " employee " doing various jobs like taking orders , delivering pizzas , handling money and vacuuming the floors - none of which they do particularly well			1
each video is adorable , weird and totally pointless , just like most cat videos on the internet			2
but if you love animals you 'll be hooked on this cheesy campaign			0
the ginger cat coughs one up while the other cats do not look amused wearing adorable miniature @entity9 uniforms , the furballs with attitude run the restaurant and needless to say , they 're not very good at it ! from taking phone orders , mapping out delivery routes , making pizzas and of course , taking designated sleep breaks , the cats adventures at @entity16 are so ridiculous you ca n't stop watching			1
who knows how these pawed employees got a job at @entity16 , when they ca n't even keep their uniforms on or stay awake on the job			2
it 's a hard life for the employees of @entity16			0
this cute ginger feline maps out a delivery route break time means sneaking in a cat nap at @entity16 the message of the campaign is completely lost in the cuteness but it goes down well for anyone needing a laugh			0
' we 're not quite sure of the actual point of it all , but according to the translation of the @entity76 page , " @entity16 ! @entity77 is a fictional store			1
" shocking , i know , but it 's great anyway , ' @entity78 of @entity79 posted on their @entity83 section			0
although getting a pizza with an extra topping of cat fur does n't seem very appealing or appetizing , these videos are ridiculously moorish			0
this kitty takes his job very seriously			0
it 's not every day a cat gets to run a pizza restaurant at @entity16 they take their jobs very seriously ... just as long as it does n't get in the way of chasing balls of wool fast deliveries and excellent customer service are not on the menu at @entity16			1

@entity9 has opened a fictional new store called @entity16
the *pizzeria* will be run by a band of adorable cats in @entity9 uniforms
@entity9 has released a series of videos of the cats performing different jobs at @entity16 as part of a new viral marketing campaign
the purpose of the marketing campaign is *unclear* but totally adorable
