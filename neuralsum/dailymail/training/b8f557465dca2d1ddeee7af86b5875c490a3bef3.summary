by @entity0 next month marks the 25h anniversary the @entity3 crash in @entity4 , which has become the subject of a new book that exposes in graphic detail what went on inside the doomed plane on its long , tortuous way down			1
on july 19 , 1989 , a dc - 10 plane with 296 people on board , among them 50 children , was making its way from @entity16 to @entity17 when disaster struck			1
as @entity19 describes in his book @entity3 : a story of @entity22 , out in bookstores july 7 , about a half hour into the flight travelers and crew heard a deafening explosion			1
against all odds , 185 people made out of the flaming wreckage alive in large part thanks to the actions of the plane 's experienced crew			1
in his quest to reconstruct the disaster , @entity36 , himself a commercial pilot , interviewed hundreds of survivors , airport personnel and rescuers in order to piece together the disturbing narrative of the ill - fated flight , the @entity58 reported as @entity36 explains in his book , when it became apparent that the jet was flying on two engines and with no hydraulics to steer it , no one aboard @entity3 or in the air traffic control tower could imagine that the inevitable crash would be survivable			1
one of the passenger interviewed for the book told @entity36 : ' the first thing that strikes your mind is , “ @entity83 , i ’m going to die this afternoon			1
” the only question that remains is : how long is it going to take @entity4 to hit me ? ’ @entity3 set out from @entity87 in @entity16 at 2.09pm			1
about 30 minutes later , an explosion rocked the plane when engine @entity90 failed , taking out the hydraulics with it			1
perfect storm : a burnt area shows the contact point and crash path of @entity3 after it exploded on impact after losing one of its engines and its hydraulics twisted wreckage : on july 19 , 1989 , the @entity43 plane suffered a full hydraulic failure requiring an attempted landing under throttle control alone			1
it crashed on the runway at @entity34 , @entity4 killing 111 of 296 people on board iconic : guardsman @entity112 carries 3 - year - old passenger @entity3 away from the wreckage of @entity3 flight attendant @entity115 recalled that the sound was indescribable			1
following her training , the stewardess and her colleagues headed to the cockpit , and what they saw inside made it clear to them that the plane was going down			2
after the initial shock , @entity124 returned to her duties , but was visibly upset			0
passenger @entity127 , who happened to be a @entity43 pilot instructor by trade , grabbed her by the hand and reassured her that the jet can fly on two engines			1
when @entity124 said she had been told by the captain that the plane no longer had hydraulics and that the backup system was down , @entity133 was incredulous			1
@entity133 suggested that he might be able to help , and the pilots quickly took him up on his offer , inviting him into the cockpit			0
later , the instructor would be hailed as a hero for his role in saving nearly 200 lives			0
that day , the person responsible for the fate of all the passengers and crew was captain @entity149 , a 33 - year - old veteran with an extensive experience flying dc - 10s			1
@entity149 decided to put @entity133 's expertise to good use and placed him in charge of the throttles			1
gruesome : rescuers who rushed to the scene encountered people who suffered unimaginable injuries , with clothes melting into their skin and one woman without a scalp against all odds : captain @entity149 , a 33 - year aviation veteran , was able to crash - land the disabled plane in such a way that the majority of the passengers and crew came out of the crash alive back in the cabin , flight attendants were doing all they could to keep panic at bay and guide the passengers through the ' roughest landing ' of their lives , as captain @entity149 would later put it when addressing the 295 people before impact			1
@entity182 , the most experienced of the stewardesses , was struck by the realization that there were 50 children aboard the plane who were sitting in their parents ' laps rather than in their own seats			2
according to standard operating procedures , @entity182 was supposed to instruct passengers to place their kids on the floor of the plummeting aircraft and create buffers around them with seat cushions , but she was disgusted at having to utter those words out loud			0
high honor : president @entity201 , right , meets with capt. @entity149 at the @entity202 in sept 7 , 1989 ‘ as i ’m saying this , i ’m like , “ @entity209 , this has got to be the most ludicrous , ludicrous thing i ’ve ever said in my life , ” ’ she told @entity36			1
as the 369,000 - pound plane continued cartwheeling over the bluffs outside @entity34 at 250 mph , people began making final preparations : writing notes for loved ones , saying their goodbyes and hiding their driver ’s licenses in their clothing to make it easier to identify their remains later			1
in the cockpit , the pilots were desperately trying to steer the out - of - control jet toward @entity225 22 at the nearby airport			0
the pilots could not afford to let themselves succumb to despair , so they did their best to lighten the mood in the face of an almost certain death			0
at one point , the cockpit ’s voice record picked up @entity127 tell the captain : ‘ i 'll tell you what , we 'll have a beer when this is all done			2
’ @entity149 said in reply : ‘ well i do n't drink , but i 'll sure as hell have one			2
’ the 57 - year - old captain would later note : ‘ we were too busy [ to be scared ]			2
you must maintain your composure in the airplane or you will die			0
you learn that from your first day flying			0
’ just after 3.50pm , about an hour after the first fateful explosion , the hulking machine fell out of the sky , screaming toward earth at 240 knots - about 100 knots over normal landing speed			0
the plane 's right wing was knocked off on impact , causing 10,000lbs of fuel to spew out of the metal stump			2
the cockpit and the tail came off the wreckage next			0
the plane finally came to rest on its back , leaving terrified passengers dangling upside down still bucked in their seats			2
first - hand account : @entity268 of @entity269 , @entity270 , looks for her husband after talking to reporters about her experience aboard @entity3 ' we just smashed into the earth , ' recalled @entity182 , who had half of her hair singed off by the flames raging around the plane			1
sitting in the cockpit with the crew , @entity127 had a firs - row seat on the unfolding calamity			2
‘ i was upside down , i had mud in my eyes and my ears , i could n’t hear , i could n’t see , i could n’t move ... tremendous pain , ’ he was quoted in the book			2
‘ my ribs were broken and they punctured my right lung cavity and stuck in there			0
just could n’t get a breath of air			0
’ the air was filled with the anguished screams of the injured and the dying			0
when first responders , who have been waiting on the ground as the plane was making its agonizing descent , rushed to the wreckage , they discovered many people with injuries of the sort they have never seen before			2
some people had their clothes dissolve into their skin , others looked like their bodied passed through a cheese grater			0
passenger @entity311 was hurled into the air and landed in a cornfield with third - degree burns and broken feet , but such was his shock that he stood up and walked away			0
@entity36 tells in the book about a female passenger who was hanging upside down in her seat and screaming for help			1
when first responders finally reached her and slashed the seat belt holding her in place , her body split into two			0
and then there was the woman who was scalped by debris from her eyes back			0
but amid the blood , mud , soot and raging flames there were also numerous acts of heroism			0
firefighters and members of the @entity339 converged on the plane , carrying people , alive , dead and somewhere in between , out to safety			2
@entity343 , a local firefighter , told @entity36 about the little girl whom he pulled out of the scorched plane , but it was too late for her			1
on of the most enduring images to have come out of the crash was that of @entity350 cradling 3 - year - old @entity3 after rescuing him out of the plane			1
the iconic photo was later turned into a sculpture titled @entity354 , which graces the @entity355 in @entity34			2
@entity357 task : @entity359 soldiers search a bean field for casualties near the burned engine of a @entity363 everyday heroes : flight attendants who aided the victims of flight 232 pose july 28,1989 at a news conference in @entity17 , ( l to @entity369 ) @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , and @entity375 and it was not just professional rescuers who risked their lives to save virtual strangers			1
passenger @entity381 , then 29 years old , jumped back into the still - burning plane after promising a mother to find her baby - and through luck and sheer determination he was able to make good on his promise			0
‘ i know i could n’t see anything , and i do remember honing in on the cries , ’ he is quoted in the book as saying			0
‘ “ keep crying , ” i remember saying to myself			0
” please , keep crying			0
” ’ a @entity393 investigation later determined that the crash was caused by a small fatigue crack , which @entity363 maintenance personnel had failed to detect			1
on july 18 , retired captain @entity149 , @entity182 and other surviving members of the @entity3 crew will return to @entity34 for a panel discussion about the disaster that changed their lives forever , according to @entity404			1
on the day of the 25th anniversary , ceremonies will be held to honor the victims of the crash , followed by a remembrance service			0
several dozen survivors are expected to attend the events surrounding the sombre anniversary .			0
