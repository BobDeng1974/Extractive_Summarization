a robotic suit that is worn as an exoskeleton and can be used to help disabled people walk again has received an @entity4 certificate from the @entity6 safety monitoring agency			1
the approval means that the @entity8 , designed by @entity10 robotics firm @entity9 , has passed the required safety tests , paving the way for the suit to be sold in other parts of @entity15 , including the @entity16			1
@entity8 , which stands for @entity17 , responds to biosignals detected on the wearer 's skin that are sent to the muscles which in turn makes the robotic limbs move			1
a robotic exoskeleton used to help disabled people walk has been approved for sale in @entity6			1
this means the @entity10 @entity8 , pictured , could soon be sold in other parts of @entity15 including the @entity16 @entity10 robotics firm @entity30 's ceo @entity29 , pictured right , presents the medical @entity8 as demonstrated , left and far right , by a @entity30 employee			1
there are two types of @entity8 system			0
the @entity8 3 system , pictured , is a leg - only device , while the full - body @entity8 5 additionally works with arms and torsos height : 1.6m weight : @entity43 approximately 23kg , @entity42 body approximately 15kg power : charged battery ( @entity46 ) continuous operating time : 2 hours 40 minutes motions : @entity50 activities including standing up from a chair , walking , climbing up and down stairs , holding and lifting heavy objects			0
@entity30 and @entity54 began hospital trials of the @entity8 suit in 2012 in @entity10			2
by october 2012 @entity8 suits were being used by 130 different medical institutions across the country			0
in february this year , the @entity8 system became the first powered exoskeleton to receive global safety certification and it has now received a @entity63 in @entity6			1
this means it has passed the @entity6 safety standards of the @entity67 agency and is allowed to be sold in the country			1
the exoskeleton was demonstrated during a press conference to celebrate the news at the company headquarters in @entity73 , north - east of @entity74 , @entity76 prefecture , @entity10			0
it has been designed to ' support and expand the physical capabilities of its users , particularly people with physical disabilities			0
' there are two types of @entity8 systems : @entity8 3 provides leg function , while @entity86 is a full - body exoskeleton for the arms , legs , and torso			2
@entity8 5 can help the wearer to lift and carry about five times as much weight as he or she could lift and carry unaided before			2
@entity50 activities that the @entity8 system can help disabled people do include standing up from a chair , walking , climbing up and down stairs , pictured , and holding or lifting heavy objects a @entity30 employee demonstrates the medical @entity8 during a press event at the company headquarters in @entity73 , north - east of @entity74 after the suit received an @entity4 certificate from @entity6 safety monitoring agency @entity107 the @entity8 system detects biosignals on the surface of a wearer 's skin			1
based on these signals @entity8 then moves the robotic joint in time with the wearer 's muscle movement @entity8 is a ' cyborg - type robot ' that can be used to replace limb function or expand and improve a person 's physical capability and wellbeing			1
when a person attempts to move , nerve signals are sent from the brain to the muscles through motoneurons			0
this moves the musculoskeletal system as a consequence			0
weak biosignals can be detected on the surface of the skin and @entity8 catches these signals through a sensor attached on the skin of the wearer			2
based on the signals obtained , the power unit is then controlled to move the joint in time with the wearer 's muscle movement			1
@entity138 calls this a ' voluntary control system ' that interprets the wearer 's intention to move , using the biosignals , and registers these in advance of the actual movement			2
@entity8 additionally comes with a ' robotic autonomous control system ' that provides human - like movement based on a robotic system which works with the ' autonomous control system '			0
this has been designed to make the movements as natural as possible			0
@entity138 claims @entity8 is the world 's first cyborg - type robot controlled by this unique @entity152			0
the company want the device to be used in various fields such as rehabilitation support and physical training support in medical field , @entity159 ( @entity159 ) support for disabled people , heavy labour support in factories and rescue support at disaster sites , as well as in the entertainment industry .			0

the @entity17 ( @entity8 ) robotic suit has passed @entity6 safety tests , *increasingly* the *chances* of it being sold in other parts of @entity15
worn as an exoskeleton , it responds to signals sent from a wearer 's brain , enabling those who has lost the use of their legs to walk again
