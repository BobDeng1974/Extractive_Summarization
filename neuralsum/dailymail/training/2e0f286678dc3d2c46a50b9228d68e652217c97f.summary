by @entity0 published : 19:22 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 01:52 est , 8 april 2013 she has never been shy of showing off a new look			0
but it is not only @entity5 ’s fashion sense that has changed over the years – her bust size has had its ups and downs too			2
now the former @entity5 appears to have had the last vestiges of her breast implants removed			1
the 38 - year - old showed off the results in a light strappy top as she took her four children to lunch in @entity16			0
@entity5 's original shape in 1997 when she was a @entity18 , left , and the pneumatic look in 2006 when she was a @entity20 , right smaller but still curvy as a @entity21 in 2009 , left , and back to a @entity18 again with daughter @entity22 in @entity16 , right her much - reduced cleavage was a far cry from the pneumatic look she sported as she cheered on @entity26 during the @entity27 in @entity28 in 2006 , and appeared even flatter than her drastically reduced bust of four years ago			1
she reportedly had her first breast reduction procedure in 2009 , taking them from an artificial @entity20 to a slightly more natural @entity21			0
now , it appears mrs @entity5 , who had her fourth child , daughter @entity22 , in 2011 , has reverted to the original @entity18 size she displayed as a young @entity35 in the 1990s			1
mrs @entity5 , whose husband @entity36 now plays for @entity37 after five years with @entity38 , is believed to have had her initial breast enlargement following the birth in 1999 of her first son , @entity42			1
according to her biographer @entity43 , she had them increased to a @entity45 at a @entity47 clinic at a cost of £ 10,000			0
in 2001 , it was reported she had a second operation to enlarge her bust size to @entity20			0
publicly , mrs @entity5 , who also has sons @entity53 , ten , and @entity54 , eight , has always denied going under the knife			2
in september 2001 , she insisted her inflated look was down to tape and push - up bras			0
and in an interview with @entity60 for the @entity62 ’s @entity61 in april 2003 , she said : ‘ i ’m completely natural , except for my fingernails and i have a bit of help with my hair and a bit of a @entity68 [ fake tan ] going on			0
’ however , in 2005 mrs @entity5 ’s lawyers admitted that the denials were untrue and that she ‘ had in fact undergone breast enhancement surgery ’			1
mrs @entity5 , now a fashion designer , has admitted to cringing at photos showing her inflated bust			1
she once told an interviewer : ‘ i ’ve worn so many dresses in the past and when i see the photographs i think , crikey , my boobs are up round my neck again			2
’ mrs @entity5 ’s spokesman declined to comment yesterday .			2
