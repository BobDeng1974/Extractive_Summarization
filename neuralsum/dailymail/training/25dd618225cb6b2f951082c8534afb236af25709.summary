since last summer ’s reshuffle , mr @entity0 has repeatedly backed @entity3 ’s role in keeping food supplies secure			1
he has dismissed complaints as ‘ humbug ’ and claimed ‘ there is n’t a single piece of meat being served [ in a typical @entity31 restaurant ] where a bullock has n’t eaten some @entity3 feed ’			2
@entity3 crops were grown on 395 million acres in 29 countries in 2011 , according to the @entity35			2
in today ’s speech mr @entity0 said : ‘ i fully appreciate the strong feelings on both sides of the debate			2
@entity3 needs to be considered in its proper overall context with a balanced understanding of the risks and benefits			0
‘ we should not , however , be afraid of making the case to the public about the potential benefits of @entity3 beyond the food chain , for example , significantly reducing the use of pesticides and inputs such as diesel			1
‘ as well as making the case at home , we also need to go through the rigorous processes that the @entity57 has in place to ensure the safety of @entity3 crops			0
‘ i believe that @entity3 offers great opportunities but i also recognise that we owe a duty to the public to reassure them that it is a safe and beneficial innovation			1
’ just too perfect ? two @entity3 corncobs ( right ) are compared to @entity67 corn ( left ) grown in @entity68 brits who got behind @entity70 in the @entity71 should now back the nation 's farmers , @entity0 said			1
the environment secretary said 22 per cent of the food that could be produced in the @entity76 is imported			1

@entity76 fruit and vegetable growers are in a similar position			0
' we can all do more and , just as everyone got behind @entity70 last summer , we must get behind our food producers			1
' by buying @entity76 , we boost the rural economy and enjoy some of the best quality produce in the world			0

@entity98 , policy director of the @entity99 , said : ' @entity100 says that people are eating meat from animals fed of @entity3 feed without realising it			0

' farming makes a real contribution to our habitats and wildlife			0
we must be able to continue to develop our agri - environment schemes			0
