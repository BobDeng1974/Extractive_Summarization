the girls ’ distraught parents raised the alarm after finding their beds empty when they went to wake them for college			2
police discovered their passports and belongings missing and established that they had flown to @entity27			1
they alerted counter-terrorism colleagues when the ‘ extremely religious ’ pair contacted relatives to say they were in @entity6			1
officers are investigating how the girls paid for the trip – amid fears that it was bankrolled by jihadi fighters in the @entity37 who want them as their wives			0
it is thought the sisters , who have nine siblings , travelled to @entity6 after an elder brother went there to fight for @entity45 - inspired militants @entity5			1
@entity46 , the head of @entity3 group the @entity46 , said their ‘ moderate ’ parents were shocked			0
he added : ‘ i ’ve spoken to the mosque where the family worship and others in the community where they live and people are saying they are a decent family			0
we know they have gone to follow their brother , but they are putting themselves in danger and i ’m sure that the moment they arrive in such a savage country they will regret it			0
’ @entity13 fighters : @entity63 and @entity64 appeared in this @entity5 recruitment video earlier this month sources said it was unlikely women would be recruited to fight and becoming jihad brides was the most likely scenario			1

he said : ‘ we ’ve got some information about girls trying to get to @entity6 and some we believe may have gone out there on the idea of being a jihad bride			1
so there are a number of absolutely perverted messages which can brainwash impressionable young people and parents are feeling desperate about this			0
it ’s a bit like parents agonising about youngsters getting into street gangs or drugs , but the consequences are far more extreme			0
’ @entity8 police said they had a ‘ line of contact ’ with the girls and were working to bring them home			2
‘ the family are very worried , ’ a spokesman said			0
‘ we do n’t know exactly where they are but their parents are obviously very keen to have them returned home			0
