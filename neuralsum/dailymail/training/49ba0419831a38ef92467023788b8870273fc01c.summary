by @entity0 a mission to @entity3 's ' dark ' moon @entity4 could yield our first evidence of alien life , a professor has claimed			1
' a sample from @entity4 , which is much easier to reach than the @entity3 itself , would almost surely contain @entity3 material blasted off from large asteroid impacts , ' said @entity13 of @entity14			1
' if life on @entity3 exists or existed within the last 10 million years , a mission to @entity4 could yield our first evidence of life beyond @entity18 , ' says @entity13			1
@entity19 said this month that @entity3 's moons could be a cheap , easier target for future @entity3 missions			1
a mission to @entity3 's ' dark ' moon @entity4 could yield our first evidence of alien life , a professor has claimed ‘ one of the big scientific questions is how did life spread , ’ says professor @entity13			1
‘ in our solar system a lot of exchange that takes place - it 's quite possible life started on @entity3 and came to @entity18			0
' could life ' hop ' between worlds in a solar system in the form of living microbes carried through space on rocks ? there 's also been a great deal of discussion about the possible spread of life in the universe from star to star			0
’ one of the least reflective bodies in the solar system , @entity4 also orbits @entity3 below the synchronous orbit radius			2
this means that it moves around @entity3 faster than the planet itself rotates			0
the planet has two moons , @entity58 , and has an average distance from @entity18 of 78million kilometres , but can come as close as 55.7million kilometres			0
@entity3 moon : taken by @entity64 's @entity63 probe earlier this month , this image has been photometrically enhanced to illuminate the darker areas of @entity4 , one of the least reflective bodies in the solar system in focus : superimposed on this photo are seven super resolution channel ( @entity71 ) images that show more details of the moon 's surface moon rocks and @entity3 meteorites have been found on @entity18 , which led @entity13 to previously suggest living microbes could be exchanged among planets in a similar manner			2
@entity13 said a more extended solar system would be needed for exchange of materials among planets			0
‘ none of the solar systems that have been found so far would have opportunities for exchange of life among the different planets like what our own solar system offers , ’ he said .			0

@entity3 moons to be targets of future @entity19 mission
moons could have material from @entity3 blasted off by asteroid impacts
@entity4 could be easiest way to find out if there is life on @entity3
