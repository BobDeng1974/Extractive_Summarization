this week sees @entity0 packed with tattoo events , launches and concept exhibitions , as the @entity4 - arguably the best in the world - arrives in the capital			1
one such event was the world 's first human gallery of tattoos in @entity12 's @entity11 last night , curated by two of the biggest names in the art , @entity16 and @entity17			1
the pair searched far and wide for people with the world 's greatest tattoos , and last night their work came together when a mix of vibrantly inked individuals came together in @entity0 to create a human gallery			1
the human canvases were displayed in hanging frames normally associated with oil paintings at @entity45 in @entity12 for four hours , and revellers were treated to canap√©s and whisky			2
new entertainment channel @entity49 commissioned the event to celebrate the second season of tattoo competition reality show ink master , hosted by @entity54			1
the programme sees tattoo artists go head to head in a series of challenges to prove their skills and to be crowned the ultimate @entity52 - a bit like the @entity63 but with tatts instead of tarts			2
@entity66 caught up with @entity67 , 24 , who tattooed @entity69 's hand , and legendary tattooist , @entity17 , ahead of the launch			1
@entity17 said : ' many of the practitioners involved in the project are the @entity75 , @entity76 's and @entity77 of the skin embellishment world			1
' there 's no better way to celebrate the ink masters of the modern era than at the opening of the art gallery of skin			1
' tattoos on show represented a wide breadth of styles , plus intricate sleeves and neck pieces last night , a vibrant mix of inked individuals came together in @entity0 to create a human gallery @entity49 commissioned the event to celebrate the second season of tattoo competition reality show a spokesperson for @entity101 said : ' we are seeing a growing popularity in the @entity104 for shows where contestants are pitted against each other in a series of challenges to become the ultimate master in their field			1
@entity49 's @entity52 combines this increasingly popular format with the @entity104 public 's growing obsession with tattoos			1
our ink master @entity116 is a celebration of this , and a chance to observe the beauty of human inking with the same respect as its oil , watercolour and pencil counterparts			1
' these days with everyone from @entity69 to @entity127 covered in tattoos , many are still waiting for the right moment			1
leading artist @entity16 , 24 , says do n't dwell on waiting for that right ' meaning ' or pivotal point in your lift for which to mark you body , and instead pick something that looks nice			1
she encourages you to think of it as a timeless piece of clothing that 's tailored beautifully and suits you - compared to something emotional such as a must - have item that you may go off in a few months			2
the event provided a chance to observe human inking with the same respect as watercolour counterparts ' i do n't think it has to be a major moment [ in your life ] at all , ' she tells @entity152			1
' choose an image you 're going to be happy to wear forever			0
meanings are not going to stay			0
none of mine have meanings , apart from the portrait of my grandma			0
' i blame this notion on shows like @entity162			0
they want to use people with interesting stories because it makes good tv , but you have to really like the design			1
also , the tattoo wo n't take 10 seconds			0
' in terms of what makes a good tattoo , i 'm looking for longevity			1
if too small , it wont last			0
it needs to be something that will last forever			0
clean , bold lines and smooth shading ... ' @entity69 has good tattoos , @entity181 does also , but does have some weird ones			1
@entity127 has some beautiful tattoos			2
' @entity184 ( left ) who tattooed @entity69 's hand ( right ) curated the @entity116 of tattoos for last night 's event at the @entity189 in @entity12 , @entity0 marking season two of @entity191 on @entity49 @entity184 has a long waiting list of eager clients , but she 's only been in the business three years			1
' i 've been a fine artist for a long time and did art training for six years before i started tattooing , ' she says			0
as well as pure determination , being motivated and grabbing every opportunity ; @entity16 credits social media and consequently celebrity clients with raising her profile			1
' @entity69 was pretty big news - especially as it 's on her hand , her entire hand			1
' she recommends those hoping to follow in her footsteps remember it 's important to stay humble and not let things get to your head , and to also use the internet and social media , which is ' so huge '			2
@entity16 helped adapt @entity69 's @entity217 tribal tattoo , which was originally inked painfully in the traditional way @entity69 grimaces as she gets a @entity217 tribal tattoo inked the traditional way ( l ) and @entity16 helped edit it ( r ) ' the best platform is @entity223 , ' she says			1
' most people follow at least one [ tattooist ]			2
' i started @entity223 a couple of years ago and it kind of blew up from there , i suddenly had hundreds of thousands of followers - one of which happened to be @entity69			2
she knew of my work anyway and she contacted a friend of mine in the shop i was working in [ @entity235 in @entity237 's @entity236 ]			2
' @entity69 flew @entity16 and @entity238 1,500 miles to the @entity239 to adapt her tribal @entity241 tattoo			1
' she had [ the original design ] done as a spur of the moment thing ; and she was freaking out about it ... i tattooed her entire hand			0
she wanted a henna style tattoo and after looking at lots of styles i drew it on free hand			0
' many of the practitioners involved in the project are the best of the best in the skin embellishment world @entity17 is a tattooing legend who has tattooed numerous footballers including @entity261 , as well as musicians like @entity263 and @entity264 , and has been in the business for more than 35 years			1
he ran a trade magazine for 15 years , has had four books published , and has always spoken up for the trade			0
but then there 's also the personal level through which he connects to the art - at his shop			2
' i 'm really lucky that i 've got the gift of the gab , an old school tattooist is usually a bit of a showman and a chameleon with people , ' he tells @entity152			2
' sometimes a bit of a lairy lad taking about to football , and then i 'm also there for a client if their kid 's died ; i can sit there and be with them while they 're in tears			0
that 's the experience of coming here			0
' [ my shop ] is in the middle of nowhere in @entity295 , but people from all over the world come here			0
' @entity17 says the fear of the unknown has been taken away by celebrity culture			2
now that so many people want to brave their first inking , he recommends researching the artist thoroughly			0
and while he considers the look more important that the meaning , he does rate personal , poignant tattoos			0
' there 's always the skin of the artist which is important			0
you 've got to research them			0
if you 've got an artist that 's not skilful he wo n't be able to create a nice piece of work on the person			0
the aesthetic should please them			0
a tattoo is good if the person is really happy with it			0
i like tattoos to look good and to be executed nicely			2
' one of my favourite pieces that i 've done is a whole @entity40 body suit , ' says @entity17 of this piece on display ' but at the same time , i really love when tattoos have a meaning to them - i do n't mean they see a programme where someone gets three stars and say ' they represent my family ' and just copy that ... ' for example , a guy came in recently who was retiring and he wanted to get his business card on his chest - that was quite unique ... ' one of my favourite pieces that i 've done on someone is a whole @entity40 body suit - flowers dragons the lot			1
i love that tattoo ... favourites change through the years , though			0
sometimes they 're on people you 've got a great friendship with			0
' my favourite tattoo that i 've got is in the centre of my chest that i got done in @entity358 by the greatest tattoo artist in the world , @entity359 , almost 25 years ago			0
' as i once said , " in the diary of life , tattoos are inky memories "			0
