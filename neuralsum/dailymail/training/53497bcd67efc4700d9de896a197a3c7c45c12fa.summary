the world 's most expensive cocktail went on sale in @entity3 yesterday - costing the same as a new family car at almost £ 9,000			1
called @entity5 's ( pronounced ' gee - gees ' ) the cocktail is aimed at the loaded frequenters of @entity9 , where properties regularly fetch more than £ 40million			1
it was created especially for singer @entity12 at the star - studded opening of @entity5 's restaurant as the owners wanted to give her special thanks for attending			1
the price is £ 8,888 , which is equivalent to a brand new @entity30 , a @entity32 , or renting a private jet to fly a family of five to the @entity35 and back			1
a regular @entity19 glass holds 150mls , so even if they fill it to the brim that 's £ 60 per 1ml			2
due to the fact it contains some of the most expensive @entity19 and cognacs on the open market , the drink ' must be paid for in advance ' to prevent the ' rather embarrassing ' situation where a patron 's debit or credit card is declined			0
@entity5 's manager adds a sliver of gold leaf to the cocktail with an eye - watering price tag the ingredients include 1990 vintage @entity56 and 1888 @entity20 makers claim the @entity5 's drink tops the world 's most expensive tipples - beating @entity62 's £ 8,167 @entity61 into second place			1
restaurant manager @entity64 said he wanted to give the iconic film star something ' truly special ' to mark the occasion and used two of his most expensive drinks			0
the @entity5 's has the appearance of a traditional @entity19 cocktail which usually includes bubbly laced with cognac and bitters			1
but unlike them it is made with a bottle of 1990 vintage @entity56 and a bottle of 1888 @entity20			2
it also has ' lashings ' of gold leaf to give it extra bling			0
only the @entity82 and sugar are bought ' off the shelf '			0
the cocktail 's hefty price tag includes the market value of each full bottle of alcohol , which will produce approximately 12 flute servings worth £ 708 per glass - or about £ 177 per glug based on four large mouthfuls			2
@entity64 said : ' we did not set out to create a cocktail for the fabulously rich but rather to give ms @entity12 something memorable to thank her for coming			2
' the taste was magnificent , as you would imagine			0
' he said the @entity5 's - described as tasting ' like liquid gold ' - will not be added to the restaurant 's drinks menu but will be available to other ' discerning ' guests from today			1
he added : ' the @entity5 's is n't the kind of cocktail that you display on a blackboard - if you have to ask the price , you wo n't be able to afford it			1
' the price is £ 8,888 , which is equivalent to a brand new @entity30 or a @entity32 it held the crown for world 's most expensive cocktail for little over 18 months , but it 's now been beaten to the top spot			1
with a dash of @entity116 , a soupçon of @entity117 , a hefty dose of cognac and a dash of @entity82 , the @entity61 cocktail at @entity62 's @entity122 sounds like a delicious treat for liqueur fans			0
but there 's a catch that might just make patrons choke on their drink : it costs a staggering £ 8,167			0
the @entity61 cocktail at @entity62 's @entity122 costs a staggering £ 8,167 the hefty price tag is thanks to the ultra-luxe ingredients , which include @entity133 and @entity134			2
most expensive of the lot is the 1858 @entity137 cognac , which costs £ 99,000 a bottle			0
the cocktail is served with garnishes that include chocolate nutmeg dust , poppy seed essence , rose essence and a little coconut			0
along with deep pockets , those who wish to sample the cocktail will need to place their orders well before they arrive , as the drink takes two days to make , thanks to the labour intensive garnish .			0

the @entity153 was *unveiled* last night at opening of @entity5 's restaurant in @entity9
created for @entity12 - and for the rich who ' do n't need to ask the price '
£ 8,888 cocktail contains 1888 @entity20
