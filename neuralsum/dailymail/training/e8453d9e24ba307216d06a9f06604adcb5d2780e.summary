@entity0 could become the first state to curb loud movies under proposed legislation that 's drawing opposition from the @entity5			1
the legislature 's @entity7 and @entity6 is considering the bill , which would prevent theaters from showing a film or preview that exceeded 85 decibels			1
the @entity14 recommends noise should be kept below 85 decibels for workers for eight hours to minimize hearing loss			1
' hopefully this will be a wakeup call to the theater owners and the @entity5 to get their act together and do something that 's good for the public and still will satisfy their needs , ' said @entity26 , a @entity27 resident and chemical industry consultant who has pushed the measure			1
' why they need such loud sounds is beyond me			2
' movie theaters in @entity0 may have to keep the noise level below 85 decibels to ensure worker safety @entity36 , a policy specialist with the @entity37 , said he believes @entity0 would be the first state to regulate the maximum decibel level at movies			1
@entity40 , a senior vice president with the @entity5 , also said the issue is not regulated			1
a @entity43 lawmaker has unsuccessfully pushed a measure that called for preventing trailers and commercials from playing louder than feature films			2
dr. @entity48 , a professor at the @entity49 who is an expert in noise - induced hearing loss , said the 85 - decibel standard is for workers ' prolonged exposure , not occasional loud sounds from a movie			1
' the exposure is so brief and intermittent that no one with any expertise would ever say that they have any real risk of hazard or harm , ' @entity48 said			2
' i feel quite comfortable that the exposures are not anywhere near hazardous			2
it 's the combination of level and duration that matters			0
' for comparison , the @entity69 says 85 decibels is the sound of average traffic , 80 decibels is the sound of an alarm clock 2 feet away and 100 decibels is the sound of a blow dryer			1
sen. @entity80 , @entity27 , said he was part of a delegation that introduced the bill at @entity26 's request			0
that way , a public hearing will help lawmakers determine how to proceed , he said			1
' i support the concept moving forward , ' @entity80 said			0
' if there are other corrective measures without legislation and it takes care of the problem , that would be the better choice			0
' sen. @entity80 , @entity27 was part of the delegation that introduced the bill @entity40 told the committee at a hearing this past week that the legislation is unnecessary and undermines voluntary standards adopted by companies and theaters that set appropriate sound levels			2
a standard was developed at the request of theater owners to address audience complaints about excessively loud trailers and significant steps have been taken to voluntarily reduce volume levels , the association said			0
' certainly no one is going to do anything that would have a hint of being harmful , ' @entity40 said			0
' we 've gone to great lengths to make sure that average is in an acceptable range that is not harmful			0
' @entity26 says the standard does n't work because it measures the average decibel of an entire preview , so it can have extremely loud portions			0
@entity26 , who has been working on the issue with his colleague , @entity127 of @entity128 , says their tests of previews found sustained bursts as high as 110 decibels			2
@entity26 , who has a doctorate in chemistry , favors setting a peak limit			0
he says the sound is so loud it leaves his ears ringing			0
' who wants to sit there in pain ? ' @entity26 said			0
" these companies should n't subject people to harmful sounds			0
" @entity5 says the bill would violate the @entity147 right to free speech by regulating how a movie and trailer is presented and is discriminatory because it applies only to movie theaters and not to other venues such as rock concerts or sporting events			1
the @entity14 recommends noise should be kept below 85 decibels for workers for eight hours to minimize hearing loss			1

noise should be kept below 85 decibels for workers for eight hours to minimize hearing loss
the @entity5 opposes the rule and believes that it is against the first *amendment* right to free speech
