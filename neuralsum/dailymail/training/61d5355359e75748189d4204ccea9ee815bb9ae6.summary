a 5 - year - old boy was sent home on his first day of kindergarten after school officials said his hair was too long			1
@entity5 , who is half @entity6 and a member of the @entity8 , was dismissed from @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 for violating school policy that states boys ca n't have hair that is longer than the collar of their shirt , or wear ponytails			1
many @entity18 believe that hair is scared , and cutting it is a manifestation of loss			0
he was ready to go			0
everyday it was the question , " @entity35 , [ am i ] going to school ? " ' his mother , april @entity5 , told @entity37			2
no sooner had he arrived however , than @entity5 was sent home , with an order from the school 's principal , @entity40 , to cut his hair if he wanted to return			1
adding insult to injury , when his mother protested his dismissal , noting her son 's @entity6 religious beliefs , miss @entity48 demanded she show proof of his heritage			0
once she had provided formal proof @entity5 was indeed @entity6 , he was allowed to return to school , but the young boy still seems hurt			1
' it was a sad day , ' he said of being sent home			2
' it ’s kind of heartbreaking because how do you explain to a 5 - year - old that he ’s being turned away because of what he believes in ? because of his religion , because of what ’s part of him , ' his mother added			0
' our hair is sacred to us			0
' proof : @entity5 's mother april was asked to obtain formal paperwork of her son 's @entity8 heritage , and bring it to the school school policy : the @entity74 does not allow boys to have hair that goes past their collars , or wear ponytails she said she has not ruled out filing a discrimination lawsuit against the district			1

' interestingly enough , the school 's mascot is a @entity10 , with long hair			1
similar case : @entity94 , a member of the @entity95 , tribe was was also sent home from school for having long hair in 2008			2
his family took their case to the 5th @entity102 and won @entity5 's story is very similar to that of another @entity11 kindergartner , @entity94 , who is also @entity6 and was also sent home for having hair that was deemed too long by officials in his school district back in 2008			1
@entity94 , a member of the @entity95 , and his family were told by the @entity112 that he must either cut or conceal his hair			0
the family eventually took their case to the 5th @entity102 after the district refused to give @entity94 an exemption for religious beliefs , and in 2010 a judge ruled in the family 's favor .			0

@entity5 , 5 , is a member of the @entity8 , who believe hair is sacred and should not be cut
he was sent home on the first day of school , and his mother told by the school 's principal his hair would have to be cut for him to return
the young boy 's school , @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 , says boys can not have hair past their collar or wear ponytails
' it was a sad day , ' said the *youngster* of his dismissal from school
