@entity0 resigned as chair of governors after taking his children on a holiday during term - time a chair of governors at a primary school has been forced to quit after taking his children out of lessons for a three - day trip to @entity10 despite being refused permission			1
@entity0 resigned from his role at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , after furious parents noticed photographs of the trip were posted on @entity18			1
the family , who have a daughter at the school and a son at nearby @entity23 , made the decision to take their children on the trip , despite the threat of a £ 360 fine			1
mr @entity0 , who is a firefighter with @entity30 service , was warned his daughter 's absence would be treated as ' unauthorised '			1
his decision comes as @entity34 continues its crackdown on school absence during term time			2
councillor @entity38 , the executive member for children 's services at the council , called mr @entity0 's actions ' breathtaking ' and pointed out that school attendance rules applied to all parents			1
the firefighter has now stepped down from his position as governor but said he remained ' totally committed ' to the school			2
he said : ' my role in the @entity51 dictates i have to work shifts and have an allocated holiday pattern which leaves me with no choice over when i can take holiday			1
' we followed the correct procedure , according to the school policy , to request leave of absence during school time , and we received notification back from the school that the trip would be unauthorised			2
' this is the first time we 've taken our child out of school			0
my daughter has a 100 per cent attendance record and is achieving well			0
' however , this was a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for the whole of my family			0
' i understand that people will condemn me for my decision			0
they are , of course , entitled to their opinion			0
' it is unfortunate that my family 's enjoyment has caused some parents so much distress			1
' i am fully aware that my actions may result in a fine			0
i will pay whatever sanction is imposed			0
mr @entity0 said his job as a firefighter left him with no other choice and he has since stepped down from his position at @entity89 ( pictured ) ' i remain totally committed to supporting the school			1
however , as people are very quick to condemn my actions and after nearly five years of dedication , commitment and time , i feel it is in my best interest to resign from the governing body as my family will always come first			0
' earlier this year , @entity98 , 53 , head of @entity99 near @entity100 , was branded a ' hypocrite ' after she booked a holiday to the @entity103 for after the @entity105 holidays			2
mrs @entity98 had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off but caved under pressure and cancelled the trip			0
in june , a head teacher was allowed to take unpaid leave from @entity111 in @entity112 due to ' personal reasons '			1
but his absence caused outrage after parents found out he had travelled to @entity118 for the @entity119 in @entity120			0
mr @entity122 's request for time off was originally rejected by governors following a row when the headteacher of another @entity112 school was allowed to take a month off in term time to get married			1
the decision however was overturned after the head appealed with the help of his union			2
@entity132 , 30 , head teacher at @entity134 primary school , was allowed to take almost a month off work between the beginning of the @entity138 term and start of the summer holidays this year after governors said she had ' worked extremely hard '			1
meanwhile an inquiry has been launched in @entity143 , @entity144 , after @entity145 , of @entity146 took holiday in term - time			0
councillor @entity38 said : ' for a governor of a primary academy to take his children out of school during term time while we have a major drive on school attendance is somewhat breathtaking			2
' he has done the right thing in resigning			0
school attendance is a major priority in this city			0
it is part of raising standards of achievement			0
every day lost in education is learning lost			0
' the rules apply to everybody			0
' cllr @entity166 , a former governor at the school , said : ' it was not a wise thing to do under the circumstances , in view of the problem with children being off and keeping kids off school outside school holiday time			2
' being chairman of governors , really he should be backing up the school and the school 's policy			1
' the school 's head teacher , @entity184 , and @entity185 , of @entity186 , the charitable trust which helps run the school , released a joint statement describing his resignation as a ' huge loss '			1
it said : ' in this role , mr @entity0 has given a significant amount of his own personal time and made a substantial contribution to the strong leadership of the academy			1
' this will be a huge loss to the governing body and school			1
' we are all saddened that this matter has overshadowed what has otherwise been a shining example of governance and role model to other parents			2

@entity0 resigned from role at @entity13
it was after furious parents saw pictures of holiday posted on @entity18
the family , who have daughter at school , ignored threat of £ 360 fine
mr @entity0 is a firefighter and said his shifts left him with no choice
resignation welcomed by councillor who said decision was ' breathtaking '
but school 's head teacher said she was saddened and it was a ' huge loss '
