a new study has found memory loss in @entity3 's patients can be reversed			1
file picture memory loss in @entity3 's patients has been reversed for the first time , scientists say			1
a small study of 10 patients found nine showed improvements in their memories within three to six months of treatment			1
the findings , from the @entity14 , @entity15 , are the first to suggest that memory loss in patients can be reversed			1
six patients taking part had stopped working , or been struggling with their jobs at the time they joined the study			1
all have since been able to return to their jobs or continue working , with improved performance			0
the patients all suffered memory loss associated with @entity3 's disease			1
one , who had been diagnosed with late stage @entity3 did not improve			0
dr @entity28 , of the university 's @entity29 , hopes the new study could pave the way for the first effective treatment for the disease , since it was first described more than 100 years ago			1
the treatment involved a complex , 36 - point therapeutic programme , combining comprehensive diet changes , brain stimulation , exercise , sleep optimisation , specific drugs and vitamins , and other steps affecting brain chemistry			2
dr @entity28 said the findings are ' very encouraging ' , but added the results are anecdotal , and a more extensive , controlled clinical trial is needed			1
no single drug has been found to stop or even slow the progression of @entity3 's , and drugs have only had modest effects of symptoms			2
he said : ' in the past decade alone , hundreds of clinical trials have been conducted for @entity3 's , without success , at an aggregate cost of over $ 1 billion			0
' while other chronic illnesses including cardiovascular disease , cancer and @entity62 have been improved through the use of combination therapies , they have not been explored for @entity3 's and other memory disorders until now			0
' that suggested that a broader - based therapeutic approach , rather than a single drug that aims at a single target , may be feasible and potentially more effective for the treatment of cognitive decline due to @entity3 's , ' dr @entity28 said			2
' the existing @entity3 's drugs affect a single target , but alzheimer 's disease is more complex , he added			0
' imagine having a roof with 36 holes in it , and your drug patched one hole very well , ' he said			0
' the drug may have worked , and a single hole may have been fixed , but you still have 35 other leaks , and so the underlying process may not be affected much			0
' dr @entity28 said his approach is personalised , tailored to each individual patient			0
nine out of 10 patients saw memory improvements within three to six months of a therapeutic treatment programme , combining comprehensive diet changes , brain stimulation , exercise , sleep optimisation , specific drugs and vitamins , and other steps affecting brain chemistry			1
file picture it is based on extensive testing to help determine the best therapies for each patient 's brain			2
but he admitted there are some limitations to the study			2
it is complex and the burden falls on patients and caregivers to follow it			0
in this study , no patients were able to stick to the entire protocol			1
their most common complaints were the diet and lifestyle changes , and having to take multiple pills each day			0
dr @entity28 added : ' it is noteworthy that the major side effects of this therapeutic system are improved health and an improved body mass index , a stark contrast to the side effects of many drugs			0
' he said while the findings suggest memory loss can be reversed and improvements sustained , the results need to be replicated			1
the findings are published in the current online edition of the journal aging .			0

@entity14 study found nine out of 10 patients saw improvements in memories
results started to be seen within three to six months of treatment
@entity147 said results are *promising* but more extensive studies are needed
