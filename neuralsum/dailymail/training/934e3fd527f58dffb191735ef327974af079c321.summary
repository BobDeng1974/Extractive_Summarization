by @entity0 , political editor published : 18:14 est , 21 october 2013 updated : 18:29 est , 21 october 2013 the controversial ‘ go home or face arrest ’ poster vans targeted at illegal immigrants are to be axed because they have been ineffective			1
sources close to home secretary @entity6 said she had examined the evidence for continuing the government ’s billboard campaign which resulted in the voluntary repatriation of just one person			1
the campaign has been piloted in six @entity14 boroughs featuring leaflets and posters with the message : ‘ in the @entity18 illegally ? go home or face arrest			1
’ axed : billboards carrying a warning of ' @entity23 ' to reduce illegal immigration this summer two vans were driven around displaying the slogan and advertising a telephone helpline offering support and advice to illegal migrants who want to leave the @entity18			1
the campaign proved hugely controversial			2
@entity33 ministers called for it to be scrapped , shadow home secretary @entity35 accused the @entity36 of using the ‘ language of the @entity38 ’ and it even attracted criticism from the right - wing @entity40			2
but polls showed almost 80 per cent of the public backed the message , and it has been robustly defended by conservative immigration minister @entity45			1
only last week , he told the @entity48 ’s @entity47 that the campaign could be rolled out across the country			2
‘ i do n’t see any problem with saying to people who have no right to be in the @entity18 they ca n’t be here any more , ’ he said			0
rethink : sources close to home secretary @entity6 may claim she has assessed the poor results of the vans but sources close to mrs may said that after examining an internal report on the impact of the scheme , she has determined that it will not be extended			1
‘ she does n’t think there was anything wrong with the principle of the scheme but it is clear it has not been effective , ’ said one source			0
earlier this month , mr @entity45 told @entity70 that just one @entity72 man had been persuaded to leave the country as a result of the campaign over the summer			1
he had not seen one of the vans , but contacted the @entity78 after reading about them in the @entity79			2
the minister insisted the single voluntary repatriation meant the £ 10,000 campaign had ‘ already paid for itself ’ , since arresting , detaining and deporting an individual typically cost the taxpayer around £ 15,000			0
@entity45 ( pictured ) signed off the provocative ' go home or face arrest ' billboards that piloted around @entity14 shadow home secretary @entity35 accused the @entity89 of using @entity38 terminology the source close to the home secretary insisted the government would press on with a separate campaign of sending warning text messages to suspected illegal immigrants			1
the @entity78 says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas			0
miss @entity35 will today attack the government for ‘ resorting to ineffective and offensive ad vans , gimmicks or incorrect text messages to people who have lived here for 30 years ’			0
@entity106 will table amendments to the coalition ’s @entity108 which it says would tackle exploitation in the labour market and address problems with border controls and enforcement			0
the party ’s plans include making it illegal for recruitment agencies to target and recruit only foreign workers , or to run shifts only for them			0
it also proposes to introduce a requirement that every large firm hiring a migrant worker from outside the @entity125 has to offer an apprenticeship in return , although it concedes these would also have to be open to foreigners .			0

just one @entity72 man was persuaded to go home by @entity134 campaign
vans with message ' go home or face arrest ' were *blasted* by other parties
they are to be axed even though polls show 80 *%* of public supported them
