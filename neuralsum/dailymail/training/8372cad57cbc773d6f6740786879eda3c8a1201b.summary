by @entity0 remarkable maps of @entity2 drawn by @entity4 theologian @entity3 in 1694 reveal a strange view of planet earth			1
his maps appeared in his somewhat controversial book called @entity10 of the @entity2 , which sought to account for ‘ irregularities ’ on ‘ @entity13 ’s planet ’ such as mountains and canyons			1
these particular maps were intended to prove that our planet was once a perfect sphere but lost its shape because it was battered by the @entity21 survived by @entity22 , as recounted by the @entity23			1
this very scarce and unusual map of the world , shown as if the oceans were dried up , was created by @entity27 @entity3 in 1694 in his attempt at a scientific account of the origins of @entity2			1
shown here is a somewhat accurate drawing of @entity33 and @entity34 - without nearby bodies of water @entity3 ’s theory was that @entity2 was once completely smooth when , as written in the @entity23 , it was created by @entity13 - whom @entity3 said strived for perfection , reports @entity39 for io9			1
but , as is evident across the planet , @entity2 is not smooth - it is covered in bumps and dents such as hills , valleys and so on			1
@entity3 was certain , therefore , that our planet must once have been smooth , but it was later shaped by a huge event , namely the @entity21			1
his maps show the world , with the landmasses known at the time , and how he expected them to be if the oceans and seas were removed			1
this reveals the land underneath that was once apparently our planet ’s surface			2
if the ideas seem radical now , they were not well received either in 1694 , but @entity3 was adamant his theory was successful			1
‘ we have now proved our explication [ making clear ] of the deluge to be more than an idea , or to be a true piece of natural history ; and it may be the greatest and most remarkable that hath yet been since the beginning of the world , ’ he wrote			0
‘ we have shown it to be the real account of @entity70 , according to authority both divine and humane ; and i would willingly proceed one step further , and declare my thoughts concerning the manner and order wherein @entity70 came to pass			0
' the canyon - like scars which line @entity79 ' crust are seen by many as evidence for liquid water			0
but a study now suggests that a different kind of fluid - one much less hospitable to life - may actually have carved these features			0
on @entity79 , the most striking topography occurs around the equator			0
the planet ’s low latitudes are dominated by the @entity93 plateau , which hosts several towering volcanoes			0
not far off sits the solar system ’s largest – @entity96			0
near the @entity99 fringe , however , things start to get deep			0
there the land dives into a winding maze of valleys and river - like ' outflow channels ' , the former including the 2,485 miles ( 4000km ) - long @entity106 – the ' @entity107 ' of @entity79 – which exceeds its terrestrial namesake in every dimension			0
these great gouges are widely thought to have been formed , at least in part , by flowing water			2
but according to recently published research , they could have had a very different genesis , linked to the volcanoes to the west			0
a paper by @entity119 of the @entity120 , published in the @entity121 , suggests that the @entity79 valleys and outflow channels were in fact formed mostly by lava flows , which erupted from the @entity93 plateau in the planet ’s distant past			2
@entity130 's scientific explanation for @entity2 's origin appears in his 1694 book @entity10 of the @entity2			1
the work is a curious blend of geography and archaeology , which aroused considerable interest at the time			0
@entity139 is shown as an island in the sketch of the @entity142 shown here are ideas of different stages in the formation of @entity2 taken from @entity3 's book			1
on the left can be seen his cutaway of @entity2 showing how the ' body of the @entity2 is still entire ' he writes , with the centre ' consum 'd by fire '			2
on the right is a drawing on how water may have been transported around a ' smooth ' @entity2 @entity3 goes on to state that as ‘ the @entity162 was born upon the waters ’ the rains broke the planet , opening an ‘ abyss ’ into which the water drained , creating the seas and oceans			1
the rain would have fallen ‘ throughout the face of the whole @entity2 ’ and would have had ‘ a considerable effect on that @entity2 , being even and smooth			2
’ he then suggests that the rain would have run into ‘ chasms made by the sun ’ and , through a process of evaporation , gradually formed @entity2 as we know it today			2
@entity3 was n’t entirely beyond reason , however , as he went on to state that he was willing for hideas to be scrutinised - although he hints that some might not be sincere in their own studies			2
‘ i know how subject we are to mistakes in these great and remote things , when we descend to particulars , ’ he wrote			0
‘ but i am willing to expose the theory to a full trial , and to shew the way for any to examine it , provided they do it with equity and sincerity			0
’ @entity3 had various other theories for what @entity2 might have looked like both in the past and present , on the interior and on its surface			1
most of these aimed to show how @entity2 was shaped by the supposed bilblical flood			1
for example top left can be seen @entity2 's surface cracking , while @entity197 shows the ' formation ' of continents today oceans cover 71 per cent of @entity2 's surface , with land accounting for just 29 per cent			2
this water is spread across various vast oceans and seas			0
this image from the @entity207 satellite in 2008 shows the moment four storms were lined up on the @entity209 , with one in the @entity210			0

@entity4 theologian @entity3 's created maps of ' *ancient* @entity2 ' in 1694
show the planet without water before it was shaped by the ' @entity21 '
@entity3 claimed that @entity13 designed our world as a ' perfect sphere '
but irregularities like mountains and hills were formed by *excessive* water
his *series* of maps present his theory of how @entity2 *evolved* over time
