dramatic images of the volcano @entity2 violently spewing lava and molton ash have emerged - suggesting that @entity5 was quite right to ban all flights over the area			2
craters spit out lava as molten rock flows into a river in the stunning images taken over the @entity13 lava fields in the @entity5 highlands			1
the country 's @entity15 issued a ' red alert ' at the end of august after the @entity2 volcano , which lies underneath the @entity21 glacier , experienced a ' small ' eruption			1

the @entity15 issued a ' red alert ' at the end of august after the @entity2 volcano , which lies underneath the @entity21 glacier , experienced a ' small ' eruption			1
the dramatic pictures of the @entity13 eruption were taken from an altitude of 50 - 500m at twilight and with the stunning @entity32 in the background even though no volcanic ash was detected at the time , authorities took the unusual step of banning all flights in the airspace over the volcano			0
it was a move that echoed the @entity43 ash cloud disaster which brought @entity45 air travel to a standstill for six days in 2010			1
more than 100,000 flights across @entity45 were cancelled when @entity43 volcano spat ash some 30,000ft into the air , creating aviation chaos costing an estimated € 1.26bn			2
although the feared travel chaos has not materialised , new aerial photographs of the volcano in the @entity13 lava field show that airlines were right to have been worried			0
the dramatic images suggest that @entity5 was quite right to ban all flights over the airspace in the area due to safety concerns access to the volcano on foot is currently restricted because of the dangerous gases released from the eruption and the risk of flooding due to melting glaciers			0
even though no volcanic ash was initially spotted , authorities took the unusual step of banning all flights in the airspace over the volcano the @entity13 eruption has caused frequent earthquakes in the region , but on the plus side it has also created some stunning images the dramatic pictures of the @entity13 eruption were taken from an altitude of 50 - 500m at twilight and with the stunning @entity32 in the background			2

a red warning code indicates that an eruption is imminent or underway , with a risk of ash			0
closing the airspace was a move that echoed the @entity43 ash cloud disaster which brought @entity45 air travel to a standstill for six days in 2010 there were fears that an eruption could disrupt air travel over @entity45 , and aviation authorities are still keeping a watchful eye on the situation even from a distance evidence of the eruptions could be seen , creating dramatic images for miles around @entity2 is located under @entity5 ’s largest glacier and it has been rocked by thousands of earthquakes for nearly two weeks a red warning code is the most severe and indicates that an eruption is imminent or underway , with a risk of ash			1
the rumblings at @entity5 's largest volcano system , which is covered by a several hundred meters thick glacier , raised worries of a serious eruption in the early hours of 29 august , a small fissure eruption occurred in the @entity13 lava field and has moved progressively north anot ­ her fissure eruption occurred on 31 august in the same rift as the eruption which had occurred two days earlier , helping to create the stunning images seen here			2
