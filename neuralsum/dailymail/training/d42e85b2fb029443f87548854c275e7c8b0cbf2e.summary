new long - term data on the melting of @entity3 ’s polar ice is not the ecological death knell some might expect			0
a team of researchers led by dr. @entity7 at the @entity8 compared nine years of satellite measurements of glaciers in @entity11 and @entity12 in an attempt to determine if the melt - off is part of an accelerating trend in ice loss and sea - level rise			1
while the study showed a loss of about 300 billion tonnes of ice per year from the arctic and @entity12 regions , it concluded that natural processes can not be ruled out as the force behind the receding ice sheets and thus that future sea - level rise can not currently be accurately predicted			1
no conclusions : a new study says we do n't know enough about polar ice melt to say whether or not it is human - caused or if the sea - levels will rise as they liquify the ice covering @entity12 and @entity11 contains about 99.5 per cent of the @entity3 's glacier ice and would raise global sea levels by around 206 feet if they somehow melted completely			1
as such , the two ice sheets are the biggest potential sources of sea level rise and are of particular interest to scientists studying changes in sea level and polar ice mass. in order to measure changes in ice sheets on @entity12 and @entity11 , the researchers used satellites to detect tiny variations in @entity3 ’s magnetic field that are indicative of a change in the distribution of mass , in this case the movement of ice into the ocean			2
long - term : dr. @entity7 and his team analyzed 9 - years of data from satellites that measured the melting of ice on @entity11 and @entity12 beginning in 2002 , researchers looking at sea level rise led by dr. @entity67 used satellites to take monthly measurements of @entity11 and @entity12 's glaciers -- the largest potential sources of rising tides -- in an effort dubbed @entity74 ( @entity74 )			1
the study found that the two land masses lost about 300 tonnes of ice to the ocean each year of the study			0
however , the 9 - year length of the research was insufficient to determine if the melt - off was part of an accelerating trend ( ie caused by humans ) or part of an ebb and flow of natural processes			1
the study found it had almost enough data to conclude @entity12 's ice sheets are melting as part of an increasing trend with a ' reasonable level of confidence			2
' however , @entity7 ' team said another decade of data is needed before the same is true for @entity11			0
since current ice melt data could indicate variable climate trends and are n't necessarily part of an accelerating trend , the study warned that predictions of future sea - level rise should not be based on measurements of glacial loss			1
beginning in 2002 , the study dubbed @entity74 ( @entity74 ) took monthly measurements of the two ice sheets over the course of nine years			0
published in the journal @entity114 this week , the results of @entity74 did show a rapid loss of ice			0
‘ in the course of the mission , ’ said dr. @entity7 , who is currently a visiting researcher at the @entity118 , ‘ it has become apparent that ice sheets are losing substantial amounts of ice about 300 billion tonnes each year and that the rate at which these losses occurs is increasing			2
’ however , the study stopped short of pointing a finger at why the loss is occurring and could not determine if the melt is indicative of an accelerating trend caused by human activity			0
non-human factors also play a role in glacier melt			0
shifting @entity137 pressure systems like @entity138 and slow changes in ocean currents can also cause the ice sheets to recede			0
‘ so , ’ dr. @entity7 said in a release , ‘ if observations span only a few years , such ' ice sheet weather ' may show up as an apparent speed - up of ice loss which would cancel out once more observations become available			2
’ the duration of the @entity74 study , the researchers say , is nearly enough to show an acceleration of ice melt in @entity12 with a ‘ reasonable level of confidence			2
’ however , it will take another decade of satellite measurements to conclude whether or not @entity11 ’s ice is melting at an increasing clip			0
perhaps the most important conclusion from the study is that more long - term satellite measurements are vital in the effort to measure and predict future sea - level rise			1
big melt : the study showed that some 300 tonnes of ice was lost in @entity11 and @entity12 each year whodunnit : despite apparently grim data , the study could not conclude if the ice melt that occurred since the study began in 2002 was a natural occurrence or man - made data on sea level rise , much of it extrapolated from glacial melt numbers , has led coastal countries and municipalities worldwide to undertake costly infrastructure modifications ahead of the rising sea			1
just last month , @entity182 mayor @entity181 painted a grim picture of his city 's future in the face of rising tides and , he said , the increased likelihood of more events like 2012 's devastating @entity190			0
in a news conference in which he called the efforts ' urgent , ' @entity192 announced a $ 20 billion climate change readiness plan that includes moveable flood walls and levees designed to save the island city from the wrath of rising oceans			0
meanwhile , dr. @entity7 and his team warn that a lack of sufficient long - term measurements should preclude the use of current ice loss numbers as predictors of future sea - level rise			1
' therefore , ' the researchers said , ' climate variability adds uncertainty to extrapolations of future mass loss and sea - level rise , underscoring the need for continuous long - term satellite monitoring			2
' tit for tat : since the study revealed that not enough is known about glacial melt to determine a cause or trajectory , it concluded that future sea - level rises could not be predicted more questions : the study showed that there may be enough data to show an acceleration of ice melt in @entity12 , but it will take a decade more data gathering to understand why @entity11 's ice is melting			1

@entity11 and @entity12 have lost about 300 billion tons of ice per year of the 9 - year study
melt - off could be the result of natural processes
study warns against using current ice loss data as basis for predictions in sea - level rise
ten more years of data needed to discover cause of ice loss in @entity11
