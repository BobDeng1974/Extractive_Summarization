@entity0 has been holding court , discussing the past , the present and the future when @entity6 ’s name enters the conversation			1
@entity10 ’s @entity9 tie with @entity11 on saturday evokes memories for @entity0 , not least the night 22 years ago when @entity14 ’ side were dumped out in a replay at @entity16 by opponents who were then in the old second division			1
that was the first time @entity0 had been in a @entity10 squad			1
he will be in the stands on saturday when @entity23 ’s squad come to town but when he looks on to the pitch @entity0 will see @entity6 – a player with whom he shared a number of big successes at the turn of the century – and not be able to believe his eyes			1
@entity0 admitted he was surprised that @entity11 had decided to sign @entity6 @entity6 trains with his @entity11 team - mates , including @entity32 ( second from the left ) ‘ i did n’t even know ( he ’d signed for them ) , ’ says @entity0 , his eyes wide in amazement			1
‘ i ’ve been in @entity36			2
when did he sign ? ! i played in a charity game in @entity39 with @entity6 not long ago and , i ’ll be honest with you , i ’m actually surprised they ’ve signed him			1
‘ i do n’t mean that in a bad way			2
i think he ’s a great lad but i think if any of the @entity11 scouts had seen him in that game they would have left the contract at home i think ! we won but @entity6 got caught offside about 20 times			1
‘ seriously , though , i ’m really pleased for him			2
obviously , like myself he ’s wanted to carry on for as long as he can			2
have i retired ? you never retire from football			2
he deserves it , he ’s been a fantastic player			2
’ @entity23 has been happy to give @entity6 one last chance in the game he adores and that is something @entity0 can understand			1
he has unveiled plans to open an education and football academy on @entity60 , with the aim of helping young players who have been released by clubs			2
@entity6 and @entity0 train together during their days at @entity66 giants @entity10 @entity6 playing for current club @entity11 ( left ) and during his days as a @entity10 striker ( right ) @entity6 enjoys himself during a recent press conference ahead of his return to @entity16 @entity0 has teamed up with @entity71 , who became an education specialist after having a journeyman career in the lower leagues following his release from @entity10 in the 1980s , and the ambition is to get 60 youngsters on a @entity78 and sports science course , starting in september			1
‘ i ’ve had a good career and it is a clichéd answer but it is me giving back , ’ said @entity0 , explaining the idea behind the venture			1
‘ i ’m not in it for medals			2
it was an idea put together and it sounded good			0
i know many have tried it but i just thought let ’s give it a go again , get involved with @entity71			0
‘ i ’m not in it for any accolades , i just hope it works for the kids in @entity10			1
i am passionate about it			0
i ’ll be honest , i ’m not going to be there every hour @entity97 sends			0
i will be there if and when needed			0
i will be there as much as i can			0
i want it to work			0
‘ this @entity101 gives kids the chance to get back into the education side			0
if we are not going to be professional footballers it gives everyone else a start in life , to go to @entity110 , get jobs and further education and possibly play football again			0
' the stats are there to see			0
four per cent go on to play football , but only one per cent have an excellent career			0
@entity71 knows more than i will ever know about education so it ’s great to have him on board			0
’ the former @entity10 striker shakes hands with @entity126 legend @entity125 back in 2000 the powerful forward celebrates scoring a goal for @entity10 back in 2001 given the staggering rate @entity0 scored goals when he was a schoolboy , there was never any question he would make a living out of the game and he remains one of @entity10 ’s most revered former players			1
the journey to the top , though , started inauspiciously			0
it often gets recalled that @entity0 was launched on the route to stardom in a @entity141 tie away at @entity142 in september 1993 but @entity14 actually had ambitions of playing him much sooner			1
he considered @entity0 to be progressive enough to name him on the bench as a 16 - year - old for a game that @entity10 were expected to breeze through			1
they had come from two goals behind at the old @entity149 and it was envisaged the replay would be a formality			0
‘ at that time @entity10 were going through a massive transitional period , ’ @entity0 recalls			1
‘ maybe it was n’t a bad thing because it gave everyone a little bit of a chance to see that we needed to change and we saw over the next couple of years that there was a lot of change at @entity10			1
‘ i was lucky because i made it			0
i suppose it ’s a case if you want something really bad you can get it , but the same applies in education			0
there was nothing i thought about but football			0
this offers an avenue to kids that was not there when i was younger			0
’ @entity0 celebrates scoring for @entity10 against @entity179 during the 1996 - 97 season the @entity182 legend after missing a chance to score during @entity185 's testimonial match last season			1
