@entity0 today accused @entity1 of ' wanting to live in a @entity3 universe ' as the two leaders clashed over how to tackle crippling energy bills			1
the prime minister accused the @entity8 leader of wanting to impose state control on markets while increasing costs for families with extra green levies			2
but mr @entity1 hit back , claiming the @entity14 could not decide if his policy to freeze bills for two years was ' a good idea or a communist plot '			1
pressure : labour leader @entity1 ( right ) and his shadow chancellor @entity20 look shocked as @entity0 attacks their policy mr @entity1 used his speech to last month 's @entity8 conference to announce he would promise millions of families and businesses that bills will not rise from the 2015 election until january 2017			1
the energy price freeze drew immediate comparisons with the stance taken by left - wing @entity8 governments in the 1970s to make dramatic interventions in the way industry is run			2
mr @entity1 also promised to scrap the energy watchdog @entity37 and use the 20 months to overall the competition and transparency rules to smash the dominance of the @entity42 energy firms			0
it will save the average household £ 120 each and businesses will be £ 1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills			1
mr @entity0 initially dismissed the idea as ' nuts ' but this week admitted the idea of curbing rises had struck a chord with voters			0
chancellor @entity54 claimed the @entity8 leader had put forward the same argument ' @entity56 made in @entity57 '			0
at prime minister 's questions , mr @entity1 said : ' is freezing energy prices a good idea or a @entity63 plot ? ' mr @entity0 replied : ' i will leave the @entity63 plot to him			2
' he went on : ' you are committed to a new decarbonisation target that would add £ 125 to every bill in the country			0
' clash : prime minister @entity0 dismissed @entity8 's energy bills freeze as a ' gimmick ' and accused @entity8 party leader @entity1 of lurching to the left with state controls on business the @entity0 accused mr @entity1 of not understanding that national governments are unable to influence global oil and gas prices			1
' i know you want to live in some sort of @entity3 universe where you can control these things but you need a basic lesson in economics			0
' mr @entity0 said if mr @entity1 did introduce the price freeze , it would only lead to higher energy costs for households and businesses in the long - term			1
' this is n't a policy , it 's a gimmick and the reason it 's a gimmick is that you are in favour of a decarbonisation target that would add £ 125 to everybody 's bill			0
' now it is obvious why you want to talk about the cost of living , because you do not have an economic policy any more			0
' bills : tackling the cost of living has become a major political battleground but mr @entity1 hit back , telling the prime minister he had no answer to @entity8 's new policy to freeze energy prices			1
the @entity8 leader said the government 's policy to help consumers switch to the lowest energy tariff would not help 90 per cent of the population , whereas his policy would benefit 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses across the country			2
mr @entity1 said : ' what is clear is that you are floundering around and you have no answer to @entity8 's energy price freeze			0
' you did n't even defend your own policy , which wo n't benefit 90 per cent of the country			0
' you say you want to bring energy prices down but can you confirm that energy prices have gone up by £ 300 since you became prime minister ? ' but mr @entity0 insisted energy prices doubled under @entity8 and electricity prices went up by 50 per cent .			1

@entity8 would *legislate* to freeze bills from may 2015 to january 2017
households would save £ 120 and businesses would be £ 1,800
but @entity0 warns governments can not control global oil and gas prices
