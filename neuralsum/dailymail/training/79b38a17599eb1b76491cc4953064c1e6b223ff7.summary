from a curved design to faster processors , @entity0 has been teasing upcoming features of its next @entity5 phone for weeks			2
now , a pair of designers has created what they believed the handsets will look like , based on the latest leaks			2
@entity0 is set to unveil the handset in @entity12 on march 1st			1
created by designes @entity23 and @entity24 , the new renders show both expected versions - a standard one and an ' edge ' with both sides having curved displays			1
both phones are also expected to have all - metal bodies , in a move away from @entity0 's current plastic range , and 5.1 - inch screens			1
the @entity18 giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival @entity21			0
and the curved screen has already been used in @entity0 's @entity36			0
however , the @entity37 will have the ability to work in a left or right - handed mode users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them			1
both phones are also expected to have all - metal bodies , in a move away from @entity0 's current plastic range , and 5.1 - inch screens			1
the handsets are also set to include wireless charging capabilities			1
and now the @entity18 firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built - in			1
many current phones need specially - designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly , but @entity0 's next - generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip			0
in a blog post by @entity64 , principal engineer in @entity0 ' it and mobile division wrote : ' 2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging			1
the @entity70 is expected to look similar to @entity21 's @entity72 handset it will also include a rumoured 20 megapixel camera previous leaks said the @entity70 will feature a @entity77 5.5 - inch display			1
other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches			0
it is expected to have an octa - core processor and @entity84 rear - facing camera			2
more recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an edge version of its flagship phone			0
the @entity37 is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides			1
the @entity18 giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival @entity21			0
and the curved screen has already been used in @entity0 's @entity94			0
however , the @entity37 will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode			1

both handsets are expected to be unveiled at @entity106 on 1 march			1
' with our upcoming @entity5 smartphones , users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before			2
' the use of the plural ' smartphones ' adds further weight to the fact @entity0 will unveil at least two handsets at this year 's @entity106 in @entity12 in march			1
these are expected to be the @entity116 , and the @entity37 that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides			1

there are three wireless charging organisations including the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) , and its @entity132 standard , the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) and the @entity134 ( @entity135 )			1
@entity0 is a member of all three groups			0
this means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use , and not every standard is supported across different charging points , for example			2
however , last year , components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in january , the @entity133 and @entity135 announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features			1
the @entity70 wo n't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the @entity152 already offers this feature - but the @entity152 runs on the @entity132 standard			1
