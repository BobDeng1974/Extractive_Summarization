smoking during pregnancy can affect the growth of a woman ’s future grandchildren , a new study has warned			1
researchers have found that if a maternal grandmother smoked during pregnancy , her grandsons became heavier than expected during adolescence , but the study also found those grandsons had better cardiovascular fitness			1
however when both the maternal grandmother and the mother had smoked , girls had reduced height and weight compared with girls whose mothers , but not grandmothers , smoked			1
and both granddaughters and grandsons tended to have greater bone mass and lean muscle mass. the study was carried out in @entity36 and published in the @entity37 and suggests the effects of smoking during pregnancy can span generations			2
senior author professor @entity42 said : ‘ these likely transgenerational effects from the grandmothers ' smoking in pregnancy need to be taken into account in future studies of the effects of maternal smoking on child growth and development			0
‘ if replicated , such studies could be a useful model for the molecular analysis of human transgenerational responses			0
’ @entity58 guidelines warn that smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk of a baby being stillborn , make it more likely that it will be born early and make it less able to cope with any birth complications			0
in nonsmoking mothers whose paternal grandmothers smoked during pregnancy , granddaughters tended to be taller , the report claims ( file picture )			0
