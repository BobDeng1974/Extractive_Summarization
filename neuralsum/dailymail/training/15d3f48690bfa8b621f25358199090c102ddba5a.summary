by @entity0 published : 14:45 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 10:05 est , 30 july 2013 wearing a ' do n't frack my future ' t - shirt and fighting against the grip of four police officers , @entity1 was today removed from a rural drilling site she and a group of 100 campaigners have occupied for the last five days			1
mrs @entity1 , who has worked as a @entity12 model and @entity13 , was carried away from the oil drilling site by officers after she tried to stop a lorry of office furniture from entering			1
the 45 - year - old @entity18 councillor is believed to have tried to create a blockage as deliveries of equipment were made to the site near @entity23 , @entity24			1
protesters are fearful that the exploratory oil drilling planned at @entity44 could lead to fracking , the contorversial process of pumping high pressure liquid underground to split shale rock and free gas			1
campaigners against the method have raised concerns about the chemicals used in fracking as well as the impact on the environment			1
@entity57 said policing the protest has put a strain on their resources , with ' some proactive work ' being postponed as a result			2
campaigner : mrs @entity1 modeled for @entity12 ( left ) and the sun. she is now a @entity18 councillor loud and clear : demonstrators tried to prevent police officers from escorting a lorry carrying equipment for the drilling site the campaigners have counted @entity70 - the former model and ex-wife of @entity73 @entity72 - in their company			1
@entity75 , of @entity44 , said around 100 people turned out to protest today , including a pregnant woman who stood in front of a truck			2
she said : ' we are not going away			2
we have already caused significant delays			2
over 90 % of the @entity44 community have said they support non-violent action			0
' we are being brought food and water by villagers and our toilets have been hired by @entity89			0
the villagers have been incredibly supportive			0
one even brought down cream teas from a wedding			0
' stand off : police prepare to eascort the lorry into the @entity96 site			1
the company has fracked elsewhere and protestors fear they will do so at the @entity44 site in the future costly : superintendent @entity101 , of @entity57 said their resources have been stretched by policing the demonstrations superintendent @entity101 , of @entity57 , said his officers were doing their best to strike a balance between people ’s right to protest alongside @entity37 ’s right to operate			1
he said : ' we understand how strongly some people feel about the issue of fracking but it is important that they work with us to protest safely and peacefully			0
' our primary tactic is to talk to people , and officers are going to great lengths to explain to people why we are there and what is acceptable in terms of their safety and others working at the location			0
' when we police these kinds of demonstrations we will always look for a negotiated response			1
we would much rather talk to people and persuade them to move than use coercion			0
' some pictures in the media look dramatic			0
what they often do n’t show is the length officers have gone to persuade protesters to move			0
arrests : six people were arrested today , taking the total number of protestors held by the police to 23 blockade : the crowd of protestors stood in front of the delivery lorry , blocking its way into the drilling site struggle : police said their aim was to move people by talking to them , rather than physically removing them ' if protesters block the way and it is lawful for the company to operate then they need to move			1
' if they are repeatedly asked to move , and at times are putting their own safety at risk , some level of coercion has to be used			0
' @entity37 rebutted rumours that it had suspended plans to drill because of the protests , with officials saying drilling will start as soon as possible			2
the company has said it has followed all legal and regulatory procedures concerning its exploratory drilling plans and obtained relevant approvals			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
