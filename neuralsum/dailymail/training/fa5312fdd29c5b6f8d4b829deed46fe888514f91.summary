the hunt for life elsewhere in the universe is now essentially a three - horse race between finding microbes in our solar system , signals from an intelligent race or clear signs of organisms in the atmosphere of an exoplanet			1
but one expert has claimed that , while the other two ‘ horses ’ might be important , finding intelligent life would have the most profound impact - because it might not be ‘ life ’ as we know it			1
instead , she says that the first life we find might instead be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans , too , will one day be more machine than man			1
dr @entity25 from the @entity26 says the first intelligent aliens we find might not be biological			1
speaking to @entity28 she said advanced aliens might be machines ( stock image shown )			1
@entity32 is already heading in this direction , she claimed speaking to @entity28 , dr @entity34 , an associate professor in @entity36 at the @entity26 and author of several articles on alien life , explained her theory			1
she has been working on it with dr @entity42 from @entity43 ( @entity43 )			1
‘ what i was focusing on was a bit unusual , because i was arguing that the most advanced alien civilisation would actually be forms of @entity48 , ’ she explained			1
she adds that they might not be the life we find first , with the discovery of microbial life in the solar system being more likely			1
professor @entity55 has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			0
speaking at an event in @entity63 this week , the physicist told the @entity64 that : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			1
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity48 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			2
' he argued that developments in digital personal assistants @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 are merely symptoms of an it arms race which ' pale against what the coming decades will bring			2
' but professor @entity55 noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant , with the potential to eradicate , war , disease and poverty			0
‘ but it would n’t be the same as finding little green men , ’ she added			2
‘ it would n’t be as @entity97 - shattering			0
’ what form that intelligent life might take , though , could come as somewhat of a surprise			2
‘ if you look at our own civilisation , people are becoming more immersed in computers , and we can already see signs of it in our own culture , ' she continued			0
‘ @entity110 is faster than brains			0
‘ the idea is that our brains are actually fairly slow ; think about how hard it is to even remember a phone number			0
‘ @entity48 researchers are doing quite well and most people in computer science think we are 50 years away from @entity48 that is smarter than us			0
‘ so it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological , we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “ upload ” themselves			1
‘ it sounds kind of crazy , and i do n’t approve of this as a philosopher , but i think the thing is that that ’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice			0
‘ @entity132 will be vastly older than us , so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of @entity48 that are far smarter than we are			0
‘ kind of mind - blowing , is n’t it ? ’ most regard the hunt for alien life as a three horse race at the moment between finding microbes in our solar system , signals from an intelligent race or clear signs of organisms in the atmosphere of an exoplanet ( artist 's illustration shown ) dr @entity25 continued that she does n’t necessarily think our transcendence to an @entity48 - based race will be set in stone , and there will be some people who resist it			1
‘ in @entity160 the @entity159 refuse the use of technology , and hopefully other people would think things through very quickly , ’ she said			0
but she added she ‘ would n’t be surprised if in 50 years we have the internet wired to our brains			0
’ aside from a computational aspect , another limitation of our brains is their size and vulnerability , something that suggests a race more advanced than us would do away with them			2
‘ the idea kind of floating around @entity175 and the @entity176 is that the most sophisticated alien civilisations we encounter would not be biological			2
‘ our brains are limited to the size of our skull , but a computer can take up an entire planet or city			0
‘ and if you need space travel , humans are n’t very durable			0
but with computers , you do n’t have the same threat to worry about			0
’ ' the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological , ' said dr @entity25			1
recently experts in @entity190 discussed chances of finding alien life			1
@entity43 astromoner dr @entity42 said we ' could be the first ' generation to know we are not alone such a discovery would suggest that the shift from biological to machine is something that takes place on other planets , and would ultimately indicate the direction humanity is going			1
and it would have a huge impact on our society , ‘ like a science fiction novel come to life , ’ according to dr @entity25			1
‘ i think finding a more sophisticated form of life would be mind - blowing to most people			2
‘ maybe they would just get back on with their lives after a week or so			0
but it would certainly shake them up			0
’ when , or if , such a discovery might occur , though , is anyone ’s guess at the moment			0
some people at @entity175 and @entity43 think that alien life , perhaps just microbial and not intelligent , will be found in the next 20 years			1
but if intelligent life is one day found , the nature of it could have a huge impact on humanity today , and in the future			2
‘ in a way finding @entity48 could be even more surprising than finding little green men , ’ dr @entity25 concluded			1
@entity43 astromoner dr @entity42 says we ' could be the first ' generation to know we are not alone			1
pictured is the surface of @entity235 , where microbial life might one day be found another method of finding life might be through an indirect observation in the atmosphere of an exoplanet using something like the @entity243 , illustration shown , which is set to launch in 2019 earlier this year a researcher from the @entity246 in @entity247 says we should n't be looking for aliens - because we 're not ready to meet team			1
@entity250 claimed how his survey of students showed the general level of ignorance and influence of religion would leave us shocked if we made first contact			2
in the study he sent a questionnaire to 116 students in @entity247 , the @entity261 and @entity262			0
@entity250 told @entity28 he used students because they ' will be the future politicians , scientists , the people in charge , so i wanted to know what their knowledge was			2
' the results were somewhat disconcerting for @entity250			0
for example only 82 per cent of the students knew the first moon landing was in 1969			0
' we 're not ready to talk to extraterrestrials because global consciousness is not developed enough in the population , ' he concluded			0
in the recent @entity278 at the @entity279 at the @entity280 in @entity190 , several experts in the field outlined their views on whether we are alone			1
ultimately , the type of life we find first will dictate how we should react to its discovery			2
@entity43 astronomer dr @entity42 explained that the hunt for life is a three horse race			1
first , there is the hunt for life - almost certainly microbial - in our own solar system			2
next there is the possibility of detecting signs of life in the atmosphere of an exoplanet , perhaps a tell - tale signature in its atmosphere			0
and last , there is the work of @entity43 itself - which hunts the sky for signs of a signal from a distant intelligent race			1
it 's unclear which of these methods will be first across the line - but whichever one is will have significant ramifications on @entity97			0
' there have been 10,000 generations of humans before us , ' explained dr @entity42			1
' ours could be the first to know [ we are not alone ]			0
' dr @entity42 also went on to explain that he thought the first intelligent aliens we encounter might not be biological , but rather a form of artificial intelligence			1
with @entity48 thought to become more advanced throughout this century , it 's possible that just 150 years or so since the invention of radio , we will already have created artificial life			2
this would have important implications for the future of life on @entity97			0
some are of the belief that we will one day be able to ' emulate ' our brains to achieve a form of immortality			0
' the point is that , going from inventing radios to inventing thinking machines is very short - a few centuries at most , ' dr @entity42 said			1
' the dominant intelligence in the cosmos may well be non-biological			0

dr @entity25 from the @entity26 says the first intelligent aliens we find might not be biological
speaking to @entity28 she said advanced aliens might be machines
@entity32 is already heading in this direction , she claimed , and an advanced race would likely have already made this evolutionary leap
' the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological , ' she said
