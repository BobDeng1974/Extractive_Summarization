prosecutor @entity38 , representing the @entity18 , told the court his behaviour was ' totally inappropriate '			0
ms @entity38 said : ' in a vet ’s opinion , suffering was caused for the period @entity12 was bounced and swung by her tail and this suffering was unnecessary			1
' if it had continued as shown it is very likely she would have sustained injury			0
' a responsible owner would realise that treating @entity12 in this way was totally inappropriate			1
' @entity18 inspector @entity50 , who removed the cats with police officers , welcomed the sentence			0
inspector @entity50 said : ' the video , taken by @entity10 ’s friend , clearly shows him swinging the cat by its tail on several occassions			1
he said his young nephew was coming to stay and pulled cats tails so he was getting @entity12 used to it			2
' this is a terribly heartless thing to do and i was shocked when i saw the video of him pulling her up and down several times			0
' what makes it worse is that he had done this the previous day and was happy to repeat it			0
' i am very pleased with the sentence as it shows how seriously magistrates took the offence he committed , which was clearly a deliberate act			2

inspector @entity50 added : ' i found poor @entity12 very timid , but since she has been in our care she ’s become a lot more friendly			2
' had this mistreatment gone on as she grew and got much bigger , there ’s a far stronger chance she could have been badly injured			0
' @entity10 lifted @entity12 up entirely by her tail , and the weight of this could have really hurt her			1
' he admitted in court that he was basically showing off			0
' magistrates also ruled @entity10 ’s other pets - two hamsters and a bearded dragon - must be confiscated within seven days			1
@entity12 : the cat was very frightened when it was taken in but has become more friendly now sentence : @entity10 will serve 150 hours of unpaid work , pay £ 150 costs and a £ 60 victim surcharge @entity113 , the bench chairwoman said : ' we regard these offences as so serious that you should be disqualified from keeping any animals , birds or reptiles for 10 years			1
