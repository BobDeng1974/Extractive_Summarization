by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 8 november 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 8 november 2013 this is what 1kg of high - purity cocaine looks like , seized by police as the criminals that smuggled it into @entity7 are jailed for a total of 23 years			1
the highly - addictive stimulant was found in the kitchen of a house in @entity12 , @entity13 , next to weighing scales and latex gloves as the criminals prepared to sell it			1
after being cut with other powders like baking soda , caffeine , or powdered milk to increase its weight , the group would have used the highly precise scales to divide the drugs into small plastic bags or paper wraps ready to be sold on the street			2
illegal : 1kg of high - purity cocaine waiting to be cut using latex gloves and high sensitivity scales before being sold onto the streets in @entity33 @entity34 , 28 , from @entity35 , was jailed alongside brothers @entity36 , 40 , and @entity38 , 35 , after all three admitted conspiracy to supply class a and b drugs between january 2012 and may this year			1
another 2.5kg ( 5.5lb ) of cocaine was found at the same address , worth a total of £ 644,000 , alongside 380 nine - ounce bars of cannabis resin , worth £ 402,000			1
in a ' stash house ' police found a further 27kg ( 60lb ) of cannabis with @entity34 's finger prints on			1
the bars would either be sold whole or broken up into smaller lumps and sold as hashish , commonly known as hash			0
@entity57 is made from the resin of the female cannabis plant which is extracted by grinding up the leaves before pressing them into a hard block			2
users then heat the drug , causing it to break apart , before mixing it with tobacco and rolling it into a cigarette , or smoking it in a pipe			0
alongside the cocaine police found 380 nine - ounce bars of cannabis resin worth around £ 402,000 as with cocaine , unscrupulous dealers have been known to spray the plants with sand in order to increase their weight , and in 2008 around 30 people in @entity83 were poisoned after criminals mixed the class b drug with lead in order to make more profit			1
cocaine is usually broken down into 1gram wraps which sell for around £ 50 , but statistics from the @entity7 @entity92 have shown purity levels dropping to new lows , with a up to a third of cocaine seized containing less than 9 per cent of the substance			2
heavy cannabis use is linked with developing schizophrenia in later life , and if mixed with tobacco can cause lung damage and cancer , especially as it is usually smoked unfiltered to increase its effects			0
@entity36 ( left ) , was sentenced to 13 years after he was found to be the head of the gang , while his brother @entity38 ( right ) was given six years behind bars cocaine has been linked with heart disease , with even moderate use leading to thickening of the heart muscles and major arteries leading to increase risk of heart attack and stroke , according to research			1
@entity34 , 28 , was sentenced to four and a half years in jail heavy use can also lead to paranoia , anxiety and panic attacks , and also wears away the cartilage in the middle of the nose , as with former @entity128 star @entity127			2
the gang were caught despite using a mixture of ' clean ' and ' dirty ' mobile phones to set up meetings and avoid detection			0
jailing the trio , recorder @entity134 said : ' i ’m satisfied from what i ’ve heard that this was a well - organised , extensive and expertly put together drug - dealing operation supplying both cannabis and cocaine to the @entity33 and beyond			1
' the rewards were extremely high , hence the amounts of drugs being supplied and the amount of money that was floating around			2
' in the course of this ‘ snap - shot ’ of the operation , cannabis and cocaine with a total street value of £ 1m was recovered			1
' as the head of the gang , @entity36 was jailed for 13 years , while his brother , @entity156 , was jailed for six years and @entity34 was given four and a half years			1
the owner of the house the drugs were found in , @entity160 , 65 , and his newphew , @entity161 , 41 , were jailed previously for five and seven years respectively for conspiracy to supply class a and b drugs			1
@entity36 , a father from @entity165 , was accused of using his paving company as a front for the drug enterprise , while @entity34 , also a father , said he was using drug dealing as a way to better his family			2
the gang are thought to have imported the drugs from @entity174 , though the cannabis is likely to have originated in @entity176 or the @entity177 , while cocaine is often smuggled from @entity179 through @entity176 and into the @entity7			1
