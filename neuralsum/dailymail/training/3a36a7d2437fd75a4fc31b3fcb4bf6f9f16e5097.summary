by @entity0 published : 03:00 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 19:55 est , 29 april 2013 parents must do more to teach their children right from wrong to stop them becoming criminals , the police watchdog said yesterday			2
in his first major speech as chief @entity8 , @entity6 said it was the duty of all parents and families to turn young people into law - abiding citizens			1
he also accused mental health services of abdicating their duty to prevent crime , and warned that officers were frustrated with the soft sentences handed out to the criminals they catch			2
one the beat : police watchdog @entity6 called for better - targeted patrols to ' disrupt and destroy ' opportunities to offend , instead of waiting for crimes to happen and he urged for persistent and dangerous offenders to be put in prison to prevent them committing further crimes			1
speaking at the @entity33 think - tank in @entity34 , @entity35 , mr @entity6 said : ‘ parents and families as well as schools must instil in children a strong appreciation of right and wrong and the reality and instincts to behave as responsible law abiding citizens			1
’ asked about tackling persistent criminals , he said that officers must ‘ make it as hard as possible to commit the crime in the first place ’			2
he added : ‘ many many police officers are extremely frustrated at the sentences that are sometimes handed out by the courts			0
’ he said officers must find ‘ persistent prolific and dangerous offenders and take them off the streets ’			0
mr @entity6 argues that money can be saved if crimes can be prevented , eradicating the cost of dealing with offenders in the criminal justice system ‘ if you have them locked up that ’s a pretty good way of preventing crime , ’ he added			1
mr @entity6 warned that officers were often left to deal with criminals with mental health problems because the police were regarded as the public service that would ‘ never say no ’			1
as a result , officers ’ time was wasted looking after people who should be in the hands of mental health professionals			0
mr @entity6 , the former rail regulator , also complained that police were working with primitive equipment that was ‘ next to useless ’			2
a modern version of the @entity81 police box , made famous by @entity82 , could be used as a base for patrolling officers , the @entity78 think tank said on a visit to meet officers on the front line , he found one using a personal electronic organiser that was a decade out of date			1
he said officers were often putting technology such as iphones in their lockers at the start of their shifts and taking out far inferior equipment to use on the job			0
beat officers should have access to intelligence and other databases while on the beat so they know the background of the addresses and streets they patrol			0
he added : ‘ in too many respects , the technology which officers have to work with is quite far behind where it could be			0
‘ it is remarkable that the technology available to the police , particularly in their interaction with other parts of the criminal justice system , is as rudimentary and as primitive as it is			0
’ mr @entity6 was the first non-police officer appointed chief inspector of constabulary			1
he was selected seven months ago after writing two controversial reports for the @entity115 into the pay , conditions and structure of policing .			0
