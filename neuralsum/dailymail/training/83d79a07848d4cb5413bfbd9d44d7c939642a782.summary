researchers have developed a breakthrough technique that enables them to build ' invisible ' materials out of light			1
the method uses light like a needle to thread long chains of particles			0
and , the scientists claim , it could be an important step towards building invisibility cloaks			0
scientists at the @entity12 have developed an ' invisible ' metamaterial			1
they say their technique can be scaled up to cloak large objects			1
this image depicts an efficient route to manufacturing nanomaterials with light through plasmon - induced laser - threading of gold nanoparticle strings the research , published in the journal @entity24 , describes how engineering materials at a nanoscale level can induce invisibility			1
materials just a few billionths of a metre across can be built to alter the way in which light passes through them			2
known as a ‘ metamaterial ’ , these can be designed to reflect light in the ‘ wrong ’ way			1
a metamaterial is an artificial material that has been engineered to have properties different to those found naturally in nature			2
according to the @entity41 , metamaterials can bend electromagnetic radiation such as light around an object to give the appearance that it is n’t there			0
to date some researchers have used such properties of metamaterials to create devices that can bend certain forms of radiation such as near - infrared radiation			0
so far , however , producing the same effect with visible light has proved more of a challenge			0
this technique involves stitching gold nanoparticles together in long strings , which is achieved by using unfocused laser light as a ‘ needle ’			1
these strings are then stacked in layers on top of one another , allowing materials to be made in high quantities			2
when light is shone upon an object it is either reflected or absorbed , dictating how it appears to a human eye			0
this means that by using such metamaterials , the interaction of particles with light can be changed so that the object appears invisible , or as something completely different			1
while the effect has been known of for some time , scaling it up to a useful size had proved problematic			0
but the @entity12 researchers have proposed this novel solution that they say makes it possible			2
a metamaterial can be engineered to alter its interaction with light and make it reflect the ' wrong ' way , making a material appear different or invisible			1
although something like the stock image shown is probably a little way off , the researchers say it is still an important step in the right direction the strings of particles are connected using barrel - shaped molecules known as cucurbiturils ( @entity97 ) , which can be used to control the spacing between nanoparticles and lock them in place			1
cucurbiturils are like molecular handcuffs - molecules which can be used to hold other molecules together			0
in this research , @entity104 were used like tile spacers , so that all of the gold nanoparticles could be held at a uniform distance before connecting them to make the finished material			1
using ultrafast lasers , these so - called ‘ bridges ’ can then be made to form and hold the nanoparticles together in long strings			2
' it ’s about finding a way to control that bridge between the nanoparticles , ' said dr @entity118 of the @entity12 ’s @entity119 , one of the authors of the paper			2
' joining a few nanoparticles together is fine , but scaling that up is challenging			0
' we have controlled the dimensions in a way that has n’t been possible before			0
' this level of control opens up a wide range of potential practical applications			0

scientists at the @entity12 develop ' invisible ' metamaterial

it involves stringing together gold nanoparticles as a metamaterial with light
the metamaterial can be used to alter interaction with light and make it reflect the ' wrong ' way , making the material appear different or invisible
these strings are then connected in layers and make a true cloaking device
