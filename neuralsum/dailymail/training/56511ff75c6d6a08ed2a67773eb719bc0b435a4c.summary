by @entity0 follow @ @ neilashton _ @entity1 was at @entity3 ’s team hotel in @entity4 with @entity7 team - mates @entity5 , @entity8 and @entity9 when he first met @entity10			1
that was in 2004 , when @entity3 were preparing for the @entity12 in @entity13 and @entity10 was a @entity15 winner with @entity16			0
it was the start of a special relationship			0
@entity10 convinced @entity1 and the rest of that team he would turn them into winners after years of near misses under @entity24			1
sure enough the midfielder , who confirmed yesterday he is leaving @entity7 after 13 years , went on to pretty much sweep the board			1
19.8.01 date of his @entity7 debut in a 1 - 1 draw with @entity40			2
211 goals for @entity7 , making him the club ’s all - time leading scorer			1
164 consecutive @entity47 games played in after his @entity7 debut , a record for an outfield player			1
150 only midfielder to have scored 150 or more goals in the @entity47			1
2005 @entity55 second in the @entity60 player - of - the year and @entity59 , named writers ’ player of the season			0
2008 won @entity63 club midfielder of the year award			1
3 times named @entity7 player of the year : 2005 , 2006 , 2010			2
he won three @entity47 titles , the @entity15 , @entity68 , four @entity69 and two @entity70 with @entity7 , since joining from @entity37 for £ 11million in 2001			1
his biggest regret is that he has not had a chance to say goodbye to the 40,000 fans who worship him at @entity76			2
he broke the great @entity78 ’s club goalscoring record when he hit the 202nd and 203rd goals of his @entity7 career against @entity81 in may 2013			1
he leaves with a tally of 211 , having finished top scorer four times , winning the club ’s player of the year award on three occasions			2
@entity1 ’s appetite for the game remains undiminished			2
the legs may be tiring after 15 years at the top , but he wants to carry on beyond the @entity27			0
the forthcoming tournament will be his last hurrah in an @entity3 shirt - he is likely to retire from international football upon their exit - but his club career will continue			0
the @entity3 vice-captain turns 36 on june 20			0
it is time for something new			0
@entity1 read the signs last season , when there were ruthless changes under @entity10 and regular appearances on the substitutes ’ bench			2
life on the sidelines is not for one of @entity112 football ’s modern greats , who commands respect and recognition wherever football takes him			0
@entity116 faced : @entity1 crossed @entity117 to join @entity7 from @entity37 in 2001 title winner : @entity1 won three @entity47 titles with @entity7 @entity120 : @entity1 won both the @entity15 and @entity68 in his time at @entity7 think of @entity123 ’s love affair with @entity124 , the @entity124 of @entity125 , or @entity127 ’s emotional attachment to @entity128			1
@entity1 has earned his place in @entity7 folklore			1
he has won admirers for his devotion to the sport and his ability to score so many goals , sometimes under almost intolerable pressure			2
in 2008 , days after his mum @entity138 passed away , he scored from the penalty spot in a @entity15 semi-final against @entity142 ’s @entity141			0
a few weeks later , when @entity143 led the team out in @entity146 ’s @entity145 for the final , he scored @entity7 ’s equaliser against @entity149			1
that time , he ended up with a loser ’s medal after @entity7 lost in a shootout			0
landing the big one : @entity1 and @entity7 won their first their first @entity47 title in 2005 cup of joy : @entity1 and @entity5 celebrate winning the @entity155 in 2007 after beating @entity156 long serving pair : both @entity1 and @entity5 have served @entity7 well during their most successful period silver lining : @entity1 celebrates with the @entity159 in 2007 another cup : @entity1 celebrates with the @entity155 in 2009 the following year , infamously , he phoned @entity162 ’s radio show on @entity163 after the presenter claimed he had ‘ let down his kids ’ following a split with model @entity168			1
not only did @entity162 fail to realise it was the anniversary of @entity1 ’s mum ’s death , but the player ’s children , @entity175 and @entity176 , spend three nights a week with their father at his @entity180 home			0
they are a major consideration for him now that he is on the verge of moving to @entity183			0
record breaker : @entity1 with his golden boot presented by @entity78 in recognition of his 203 goals for @entity7 not seeing eye to eye : @entity1 did not get on with @entity190 boss @entity189 big part of his life : @entity1 will think of daughters @entity176 and @entity175 before making a decision on his next move @entity10 wanted @entity1 to stay and had encouraged the midfielder to start taking his coaching badges			1
in the coach ’s first season at @entity7 , he approached @entity1 after training to tell him he had become the best midfielder in the world			1
@entity1 revealed in his autobiography that it propelled him to even greater heights			0
by then he stood shoulder to shoulder with @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210			0
he remained loyal to @entity7 when @entity10 tried to lure him to @entity211 in 2009			0
it was a close call but @entity1 opted to stay at @entity76 , fulfilling all his ambitions with the club on a mind - boggling contract worth £ 150,000 a week			1
he only fell out with one manager — @entity189 — during a disastrous seven - month spell at @entity7 in 2011 - 12			0
@entity1 finished that season by lifting the @entity15 trophy in the @entity221 after the final against @entity223			0
the following year , under interim coach @entity142 , @entity7 won the @entity68 with victory over @entity225 in the @entity226			2
that was the last trophy @entity1 won with @entity7 , but his legacy will live on			1
