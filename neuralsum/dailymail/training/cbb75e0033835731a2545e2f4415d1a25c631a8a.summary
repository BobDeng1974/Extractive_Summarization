by @entity0 published : 16:54 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 08:48 est , 3 march 2014 in true @entity4 fashion , the @entity2 on sunday promised a cliffhanger finale to the tight race for best picture @entity7 between favorites 12 years a @entity10 and a big gamble on rain and the red carpet			1
after three days of heavy downpours soaked parts of the red carpet along @entity18 , workers removed the plastic tenting and unwrapped the golden @entity7 statues hours before hundreds of movie stars in designer dresses and tuxedos begin arriving for @entity4 's biggest night			1
and while it was still drizzling outside the @entity26 as tv crews from around the world went live from @entity4 , organizers were confident that the most glamorous of red carpet shows would go off without a hitch			1
they did , however , keep a bunch of umbrellas on hand			0
scroll down for @entity34 busy : preparations are readied ahead of the @entity2 on sunday , march 2 , 2014 , at the @entity26 in @entity36 unlike the stormy hosting of @entity38 last year , this @entity7 show with host @entity39 has a deliberately safe vibe of cheery song - and - dance			1
the nimble and amiable @entity39 is expected to return the broadcast to more traditional territory			2
many of the night 's biggest categories , too , seem to hold little chance for surprise			2
the well - established favorites include @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
each comes into @entity2 having won a parade of awards over the last few months , including honors at saturday 's @entity57			1
the night 's biggest question mark wo n't come until the very end			2
the historical drama 12 years a slave , the @entity62 and the con - artist caper @entity64 are vying for best picture in the night 's closest contest			1
watch video here : final checks : members of the media take positions on the red carpet ahead of the 86th @entity2 in @entity4 , @entity73 gravity is expected to lead the ceremony in total awards , cleaning up in technical categories like visual effects and cinematography			1
@entity81 filmmaker @entity80 is considered a lock for best director for seamlessly marshalling new digital technology to render the lost - in - space drama			2
he would be the first @entity86 to win the category			0
while the global hit easily topped the other eight best - picture nominees at the box office , the lower budget , less widely seen 12 years a slave is believed to have a narrow edge for the academy 's top honor			1
combating the downpour : staff hurriedly clear the water away from the red - carpet in preparation for this evenings @entity2 though voters last year chose entertainment over history lesson ( @entity106 's @entity105 over @entity108 's @entity107 ) , many see @entity110 's brutal adaptation of @entity112 's memoir as a landmark film difficult to watch but impossible to overlook			1
@entity114 , which is telecasting the ceremony , hopes the drama of the best - picture race will be enough to entice viewers			2
the show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million , up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent - film ode @entity121 won best picture			2
after three days of heavy downpours soaked parts of the red carpet along @entity18 , workers removed the plastic tenting and unwrapped the golden @entity7 statues hours before hundreds of movie stars in designer dresses and tuxedos begin arriving for @entity4 's biggest night			1
and while it was still drizzling outside the @entity26 as tv crews from around the world went live from @entity4 , organizers were confident that the most glamorous of red carpet shows would go off without a hitch			1
they did , however , keep a bunch of umbrellas on hand			0
frontrunners : @entity49 and @entity50 aattended the @entity57 on saturday , and the actors did not leave empty - handed - taking home the best actor and actress gongs respectively favorite : @entity49 is thought to be the front - runner to take home the prize for best actor for his work in the @entity153 drama @entity152 this year 's oscars celebrate what is widely regarded as one of the most high quality years in film and performances in recent memory			1
the president of the @entity162 , @entity163 , called it the best line - up ' in the last decade or so			2
' that means that awards are likely to be scattered widely as the 6,000 - plus members of the @entity162 seek to reward as many films as possible with the famed golden statuettes			2
while @entity173 director @entity110 's brutal slavery drama 12 years a slave is the presumed frontrunner for best picture , @entity81 director @entity80 's groundbreaking space thriller gravity lurks just behind			1
and there could be an upset for the night 's top honors			0
' i feel more comfortable putting my chips on ' @entity182 ' just because there is more historical basis for doing so , ' said @entity185 , awards analyst at @entity186			0
' but at the same time there is no denying that there is great enthusiasm for other movies			0
' among those is 1970s crime caper @entity64 from director @entity192 , which scored 10 nominations			0
the @entity194 : @entity195 is nominated for his sixth @entity7 for his portrayal of a corrupt , cheating investor in @entity199 's hit movie for the second year in a row , @entity192 has achieved the rare feat of having his actors nominated in all four acting categories			1

a total of nine films are competing for best picture , including @entity217 piracy thriller @entity215 , the adoption drama @entity218 , the heartland comedy @entity220 , the computer - age romance her , and the @entity153 activist biopic @entity152			0
but the @entity162 could also make history this year if it chooses 12 years a slave for best picture			1
it would be the first time that the top film honor goes to a movie by a black director in the 86 years of the @entity2			0
potentially historic : @entity51 holds her award for best supporting actress and director @entity110 holds his award for best director for 12 years a slave at the 2014 @entity57 on march 1 , 2014 in @entity238 , @entity73 on saturday , the real - life story of free man turned plantation slave @entity112 gained more momentum by sweeping the @entity57 , a show that recognizes movies made on small budgets			1
it scored five wins out of seven nominations , including best feature film			0

ensemble : @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 in a scene from @entity64 - one of the leading contenders for @entity7 bright lights : actress @entity269 attends the @entity273 while @entity52 ( right ) is the hands - down favorite to take home the @entity276 for his work on @entity152 also on saturday , newcomer @entity51 won best supporting actress for her role as hardworking slave @entity280 in 12 years a slave but she faces a challenge at the @entity2 from @entity269 as the loopy housewife in @entity64			1
sunday 's show caps an unusually long awards season extended by weeks by the @entity287 and fatigue was evident			0
' yeah , i 'm a little bit tired today , ' @entity50 said on saturday , adding ' but i 'm full of adrenaline , whatever happens , it 's a very exciting place to be			0
