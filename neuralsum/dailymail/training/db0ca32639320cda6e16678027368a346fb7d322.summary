an @entity1 mediator filmed negotiating @entity3 's departure from @entity4 has branded @entity5 a ' delinquent			1
' former local government minister @entity7 was secretly recorded meeting programme chiefs before they fled their hotel because of local anger over a number plate on @entity5 's @entity12			1
@entity5 and co-presenters @entity13 and @entity15 staged a @entity16 - style ending to their now - infamous south @entity17 special , screened in two parts at the weekend			1
' he also denied @entity5 's claims in a newspaper column they had been ' ejected for political capital			1
' mr @entity7 , filmed meeting @entity3 security advisers at their hotel , told a @entity4 radio station : ' they ended the programme with a @entity16 parody and it was real but only in that they left like delinquents			1
' the idea they transmitted that they were forced to leave is untrue			0
they were invited to leave and they accepted that invitation			0
' ' delinquent ' : @entity5 was branded thus by local government minister @entity7 , who also confirmed the @entity3 presenter left the area by plane , leaving technicians to drive out of the country confirming controversial @entity5 and his co-presenters left the southern city of @entity54 by plane and were not with @entity3 technicians who were attacked by locals as they headed for @entity59 overland with a police escort , he added : ' neither @entity5 or the other two were in the convoy when it left the province			1
' that was because the local government 's primary concern was to save peoples ' lives			0
' we reserved 13 seats on an @entity72 flight which left @entity54 for @entity73 at 7.30pm that same day with the three presenters and the production team			0
' we made those reservations at their request after they accepted our invitation to leave the province and as soon as they decided they wanted to go			0
' the local government never forced them to leave			0
they were invited to leave and decided to do so by plane because of the fear they were experiencing			0
' obviously the @entity89 issue is very important for @entity4			0
it 's something they 've obviously evaluated in making their decision			0
' the technicians were the only ones who left the area by land			1
they were about 15 to 20			0
there was no other option for them because they had all the equipment used for filming			0
' we ordered the opening of a border pass to ensure there was no risk to their lives or wellbeing			0
' while they were crossing , @entity5 would have been nice and warm in @entity73			1
' legendary robbers : @entity16 , right , and his ladies ' man sidekick the @entity117 , left notorious @entity17 bank robber @entity16 is thought to have carried out two heists in @entity1 - including his biggest			1
he and his longtime partner in crime , @entity117 - aka the @entity117 - travelled from @entity121 to @entity73 in 1901			0
they settled on a 15,0000 - acre ranch in the country 's southern @entity125 province , presumably bought with the ill - gotten gains from their criminal activities in the @entity17 - but by 1905 they were at it again			1
on @entity133 that year two @entity132 - speaking bandits , thought to be @entity16 and @entity117 , held up the @entity135 y @entity134 in @entity136 , 700 miles south of @entity137			2
escaping with a sum that would be worth at least u.s. $ 100,000 today , the pair vanished north across the bleak @entity141 steppes			0
shortly after they sold the @entity144 rance and fled to @entity59			1
but by the end of the year they were back in @entity1 , raiding the the @entity148 branch in @entity149 , 400 miles west of @entity73 , taking 12,000 pesos			2
pursued by armed lawmen , they crossed the @entity152 and the @entity153 and again reached the safety of @entity59			2
the story of @entity16 and the @entity117 was made into a 1972 film starring @entity157 and @entity158			2
mr @entity7 , secretary of institutional affairs during @entity3 's @entity4 scare , also accused the @entity160 of making it appear local police were harassing rather than protecting @entity5 and his colleagues from angry locals because it made ' good tv			1
' he told @entity166 : ' the operative to get them to safety was very good			0
locals were furious at what they considered was a provocation with the number plate and we ensured there was no loss of life			0
' of the @entity3 team 's decision to abandon @entity5 's @entity12 near a town where they were stoned by demonstrators , along with @entity13 's @entity183 and @entity15 's @entity184 , he added : ' my personal opinion is that they left them as part of a show to be able to put into their programme			1
' it was another image they had that they could include			0
' the @entity3 team , featuring @entity15 , @entity5 and @entity13 , were in @entity1 as part of their mission to reach the bottom of @entity200 in @entity202 sports cars and build a ' stadium ' from containers footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in @entity210 @entity5 upset @entity22 veterans in southern @entity1 by driving through the country in a @entity12 with the number plate @entity213			1
despite denials , many observers still think the incident was a publicity stunt			0
here ’s why : the 54 - year - old and his co-presenters were taking part in a 1,400 - mile filmed trek along @entity1 's famous @entity223			2
the trio cut short their trip and took an unscheduled flight out of @entity54 on october 2 while leaving other members of their team to face an angry mob as they tried to escape @entity1 by crossing to @entity59 with a police escort			1
@entity13 's @entity183 car , @entity15 's @entity184 and the @entity12 driven by @entity5 are currently being stored in a customs ' building in @entity236 near @entity54 while officials decide what to do with them			1
@entity5 told in his @entity240 column after returning to @entity23 how protestors ' bayed for his blood ' as they stormed the hotel in @entity54 where the @entity3 team was staying			2
he claimed he was the victim of an orchestrated government campaign and had to hide under his hotel bed following an ultimatum to leave @entity1 as an armed mob warned : ' this is a mafia state , best you do as you 're told			2
' the @entity160 screened its two - part south @entity17 trek despite protests from the @entity1 government			1
@entity254 , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity23 , called the @entity213 plate ' malicious mockery ' of those who fought in the 1982 @entity22 in a letter to @entity160 trust chairman @entity259 earlier this month .			2
