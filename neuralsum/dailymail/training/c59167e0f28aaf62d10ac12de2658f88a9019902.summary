' i do n't particularly like coming second to @entity1 , ' said @entity2 after seeing his team - mate , and only rival for this year 's @entity6 title , seal pole position for sunday 's @entity8			1
it was the second such statement from @entity2 this season ; the first coming after he lost his epic duel with @entity13 in @entity14			1
indeed , @entity13 replied : ' we already know , ' before the @entity17 duo shared a rather uncomfortable laugh			2
for @entity2 however , and while he might not like being second - best to his team - mate ( who does ? ) it 's become a rather consistent feature of the 2014 season			1
i make that 7 - 1			0
@entity2 has spoken at length at the importance of halting @entity13 's momentum this weekend			1
\ but a fourth victory in as many races for the @entity47 driver tomorrow would see him take charge of the championship for the first time this season			0
you get the feeling that @entity2 ca n't let that happen if he stands any chance of winning the title			2
but with @entity13 in this form – he even described his mercedes as a ' nightmare ' to drive on saturday – it could be argued that you would n't give the @entity61 much hope			0
advantage @entity13 : the @entity17 pair shake hands after securing yet another front - row lockout down in the dumps : @entity66 it perhaps shows how far @entity66 has fallen that he was given a standing ovation on his way back to the paddock after breaking down yet again on saturday			1
it was n't all that long ago that the four - time world champion was a target of the boo - brigade ; fans seemingly unhappy with his treatment of @entity77 in @entity78 and then his subsequent dominance			0
we almost forget that he won the final nine races of last season			0
but as he hopped on to the back of a scooter before returning to the @entity87 garage , the partisan @entity29 crowd were on their feet			1
while @entity66 has taken the bold step of changing his chassis for this weekend 's race , his team - mate @entity90 goes from strength - to - strength			1
not only was he best of the rest , albeit a second down on the @entity17 pair , he was over four tenths quicker than @entity66 in @entity98 before the @entity61 's car packed up			2
is he out - performing the car ? perhaps			0
he is certainly out - performing @entity66			2
it makes you wonder how closely he would have run the @entity61 over the past four years ? off track : reigning world champion @entity66 has endured a troubled start to his campaign pastor @entity106 was back in the wars on saturday after embarrassingly binning his @entity108 on his very first lap. @entity106 's latest faux pas comes after he spun while taking his eyes off the road making his adjustments to his steering wheel before crashing on his entrance to the pits last time out in @entity118			1
it 's difficult to know who to feel more sorry for ? @entity106 for becoming something of a derisory figure amongst the paddock and the sport 's fans			2
the cash - strapped @entity108 team for footing the repair bill			2
or his mechanics for having to put his car back together , again			0
either way , it 's stunning to think the @entity133 actually won this race for @entity135 two years ago			0
i think it 's fair to say that , bar a minor miracle , it 's unlikely he 'll be presented in the winners ' circle ever again			0
end of the road : pastor @entity106 's @entity108 is loaded on to a tow truck after his crash during qualifying @entity146 may have been quickest in the @entity147 vs @entity149 battle – the @entity38 qualifying a rather credible 18th – his time would only have been good enough for fourth on the @entity152 grid			1
indeed @entity153 's lap - time in @entity154 would have seen him qualify plum last in @entity6 's feeder series			0
@entity13 's pole time was almost five seconds slower than @entity2 's pole position of one year ago			1
all in all , hardly a glowing advertisement for motor racing 's wealthiest series			0
@entity13 's pole was the 35th of his career , and first at the @entity29 @entity8			1
aside from @entity166 , it remains the only venue where he has n't tasted victory in his eight - year career			0
but the odds favour him to break his duck tomorrow			0
eleven of the last 13 pole sitters have gone on to win , while @entity173 was the first driver to qualify outside the top three and win the race when he was victorious in last year 's grand prix			2
study : @entity13 looks at the timings from qualifying after sticking his mercedes on pole in @entity29			1

@entity13 secured his 35th career pole position for sunday 's race
@entity13 will *overhaul* @entity2 in title race if he wins @entity29 *gp*
@entity66 out - performed by @entity87 team - mate @entity90
@entity108 left counting the cost of another crash by @entity106
