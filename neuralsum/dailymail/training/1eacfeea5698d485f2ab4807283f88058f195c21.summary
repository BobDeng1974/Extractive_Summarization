@entity0 have withdrawn a legal challenge to the kick - off time of saturday 's @entity3 versus @entity5 derby at @entity6			1
the force were concerned that the 5.30pm start would increase the risk of alcohol - fuelled crowd trouble and leave the taxpayer with a big bill to foot			0
in a rare action , they launched an appeal against the decision made by @entity5 council and the @entity18 to allow the televised clash to take place so late			2
@entity6 , @entity3 's home ground , will host the @entity23 derby against @entity5 on saturday @entity5 manager @entity24 ( left ) and @entity3 boss @entity25 square up this weekend @entity5 captain @entity26 is set to feature in his final @entity23 derby at @entity6 on saturday but at @entity29 on tuesday morning they withdrew that appeal following assurances from @entity3 that they would improve segregation at the eagerly - anticipated clash			1
the hearing could have had huge implications for broadcasters , given that a decision to put the match back to 3pm would have seen them unable to screen it live			0
a @entity0 spokesman said that all parties would meet within 28 days to ensure similar issues did not arise in future			1
the midfielder is pictured celebrating his goal in the @entity48 game between the teams back in september deputy chief constable @entity50 , said : ' our opposition around the late kick - off time has been constant throughout and our paramount concern has always been the safety of those attending the game			1
' ideally we would have preferred that this situation could have been resolved much earlier and we have pressed throughout to get the time changed			0
the force accepts that any change to the kick - off time at this stage would have considerable inconvenience for those fans who were going to the game			2
' but unfortunately we were given no option but to appeal to the courts and today we have been able to come to agreement about the way forward			0
@entity0 believe the derby clash at @entity6 should kick - off earlier than 5.30pm on saturday @entity3 's home ground @entity6 is the venue for the @entity23 derby on saturday ' the decision to go with a 5.30pm kick - off for this game creates unnecessary risk			1
we have tried to do everything possible to get this situation resolved as quickly as possible			0
' our request to move the kick - off time is in no way a reflection of the behaviour of fans from either club , as the majority of people who attend the games are genuine fans who go to enjoy the football and have a good time			2
' unfortunately , there is a significant minority who take the opportunity to drink and cause problems , and the additional hours before the game give these people the opportunity to spoil what should be a good afternoon out at the football			0
the @entity5 fans shows their support for the side during september 's @entity23 derby against @entity3 ' the 5.30pm kick off time presents different challenges for the force and the club and increases the impact of the event , not only to the city centre but across @entity23			1
the plan for a late kick off requires 254 police officers covering the area around the stadium , inside the stadium and also the city centre			1
' the operation would be extended to 17 hours , which would result in valuable resources being displaced from their ordinary duties from across @entity23			0
additional resources would also be deployed to police licensed premises across the county			0
' the cost of that operation to date would be £ 78,500 and at least £ 50,000 of that would not be recoverable from club			2
there is no doubt that the late kick off , to facilitate the match being played on live tv , would significantly stretch our resources			1

@entity3 will host @entity5 at 5.30pm on saturday as originally planned
@entity0 have withdrawn their appeal to change the kick - off time
the case was heard at @entity29 on tuesday
police claimed that an earlier kick - off would be a much safer option
but @entity3 officials assured that they would improve crowd segregation
a @entity0 spokesman said all parties would meet within 28 days to avoid similar issues in the future
deputy chief constable @entity50 said there is ' no doubt ' a late kick off would significantly stretch police resources
the 17 - hour operation would involve 254 police officers at a cost of £ 78,500
