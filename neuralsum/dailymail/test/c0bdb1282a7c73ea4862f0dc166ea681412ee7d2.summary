the aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to ' feel ' the sensation as intensely as possible			0
usually practiced in pairs , there is a ' strokee ' and a ' stroker '			0
@entity6 - ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation			1
@entity18 first taught orgasmic meditation in the @entity19 in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world			1
there are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the @entity4 alone			2
there are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe			1
@entity6 can be led in classes or with an individual trainer , if those attending desire a more private setting			1
in the classes , which cost £ 195 for a seven - hour session , attendees can be couples or singles			1
the director of the @entity19 company @entity24 , which has brought the sessions to the @entity4 via affiliate company @entity67 , says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed			1
@entity23 told @entity70 : ' all kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s			2
she continues : ' [ it 's a mixture of ] singles and couples			2
some couples who have been together for a year , others for 30 years			0
there are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors , teachers , programmers , managers , artists , therapists			0
' i would say that most people are 25 - 55 , 70 per cent are single , 30 per cent are couples			0
all who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives			0
' your average @entity99 might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but @entity105 believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they 're gaining a valuable experience			0
she says : ' when it comes to discussions of orgasm , relationship and connection , i believe that most people are shy			0
' but people come to the class regardless , because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career , it 's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships , even if it means being a little uncomfortable ! ' the aim of the £ 195 class is to help women prolong the ' sweet spot ' when orgasming			2
there are currently 2,000 people practicing the method in the @entity4 , according to turn on @entity67 director of @entity19 company @entity24 , @entity23 , says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention @entity6 alongside yoga and meditation a video from a private class in @entity141 , led by @entity23 , shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head			1
she is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side			0
@entity105 , who 's been teaching @entity6 for eight years , explains : ' it 's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection , vitality , wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them			1
' a woman takes off her pants and lies down			0
her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes			1
' @entity105 thinks the attraction for @entity6 is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships			2
' i believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been " on the menu " up until now			0
she adds : ' we 're ready for a different approach			0
one that is more conscious			0
people want information on how to do that			0
and we offer it openly			0
' @entity105 also leads a team of teachers , holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration , and then can partake themselves			0
she says she became an @entity6 teacher out of personal interest : ' as someone who had practiced meditation for many years , i was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner , while deepening my connection to myself			2
' as many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude , i was curious for one that instead could be done in connection , in a way that would enliven my relationships			0
i started with a class and it turned into my career , much to my surprise			0
' she hopes that one day @entity6 will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation , saying : ' our vision is that people could equally say yoga , meditation , orgasmic meditation			1
' orgasmic meditation founder @entity18 hails from @entity216			1
before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation , the author and entrepreneur was a @entity220 in @entity221 and @entity222			1
