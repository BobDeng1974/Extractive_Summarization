when her beloved dog collapsed and had to be rushed to the vet , @entity0 was horrified			1
the grandmother was left grief - stricken when tests showed @entity5 , an eight - year - old crossbreed , had lung cancer and would have to be put down			1
but the biggest shock came when she was told that her dog ’s death was caused by passive smoking – the result of being in the house as she and her husband @entity15 puffed through 30 cigarettes each a day			2
she and mr @entity39 , 67 , of @entity19 , @entity40 , were walking @entity5 in a park when the rescue dog became ill. they took her to a veterinary practice in @entity45 , where they were told she had black spots on her lungs and was also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease			1
the vet said nothing more could be done for @entity5 , adding that the cause of her cancer was passive smoking			1
‘ knowing my smoking was to blame was like somebody had just put a bullet into my heart			1
it was a nightmare that had come true , ’ said mrs @entity0 , a retired cleaner who has another dog , @entity30 , as well as two cats and a rabbit			1
‘ @entity5 was a lovely dog			1
she was friendly and there was n’t a bad bone in her body			2
fond memories : she says thinking about @entity5 ' brings a tear to my eye just thinking about the damage my smoking was doing ' - she is now hoping to inform others about the dangers of second - hand smoke @entity5 had to be put down after a scan showed up black spots on her lungs ‘ she showed no signs or symptoms of being ill. we had no idea why she had collapsed until we took her to the vets			1
it was such a shock			0
‘ you do n’t think about your animals but they are just like us			0
they can get illnesses like diabetes and cancer the same as us			2
’ mrs @entity0 says she now regrets exposing her family and her animals to years of cigarette smoke in the house and the car			1
she added : ‘ i think i would have tried to give up earlier if i had known the damage it was doing to my animals			0
as long as the animals were fed i would be happy to go without food but i had to have my cigarettes			0
‘ i did n’t connect passive smoking with animals			0
you do n’t realise how much of it they are taking in			0
my grandchildren are only here once or twice a week but our pets are with us 24 hours a day , 365 days a year			2
’ it still took her nearly three years following @entity5 ’s death before she managed to quit her 30 - a - day habit – and by then she too had been diagnosed with chronic lung disease			1
her husband has also given up smoking , much to the delight of their three children and eight grandchildren			0
mrs @entity0 , who had smoked for 40 years , said : ‘ i feel a lot healthier now i have stopped			2
‘ i can walk to the end of the path without getting as out of breath and i do n’t use my inhalers as much			0
new start : ms @entity0 pictured with her grandchildren - who are ' always happy that i no longer smoke ' ‘ my grandchildren tell me they are glad i stopped smoking because i do n’t smell of smoke any more			1
when i gave up smoking that stopped my illness from getting any worse			0
’ she hopes by speaking out she will alert other animal owners and help protect more pets from the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke			1
‘ i would tell anyone who smokes and has animals to think twice , ’ she said			0
‘ i know how difficult it is to give up but they need to think about their animals			0
do n’t give up trying , even if you have two cigarettes less a day			0
’ the @entity148 has long warned of the dangers of smoking around pets , saying it can lead to incidents of cancer , asthma and bronchitis in cats and dogs .			2

@entity0 left devastated when pet dog @entity5 got lung cancer
@entity162 informed her harmful chemicals from tobacco smoke were to blame
it meant her ' extra *special* ' , eight - year - old rescue dog had to be put down
now speaking out to protect more pets from the toxic chemicals in smoke
