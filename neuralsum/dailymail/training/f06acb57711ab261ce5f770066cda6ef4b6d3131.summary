by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 arrived in @entity3 on tuesday to begin preparations for his bid to become horse racing 's first @entity8 winner in 36 years			1
the @entity11 and @entity12 winner arrived at @entity13 , where co-owner @entity14 says his 3 - year - old underdog colt will have a guardian angel looking after him june 7			1
' i honestly believe this horse is @entity19 's horse , ' said the 61 - year - old factory worker , who owns the year 's breakout racing star along with a friend and their wives			1
he believes a guardian angel is helping usher the 3 - year - old colt to a @entity8 sweep humble horse : @entity8 hopeful @entity2 pictured after he arrived at @entity13 in @entity34 , @entity35 the colt is the offspring of an $ 8,000 mare and a $ 2,500 stallion as bred by @entity14 and his equally blue collar partner @entity41 @entity14 told @entity42 that it may be his sister , who died from cancer at just 36 , who 's looking after the team of unlikely award - winning horse racers who 've dubbed themselves the @entity49 and adopted a donkey as a mascot			1
' he was born on my sister @entity52 ’s birthday , feb. 18 , ' @entity14 said			2
' i do believe this colt ’s got a guardian angel with him all the time			2
i say a prayer before every race , and between her and him , everything ’s coming true			0
' but with or without divine intervention , @entity14 says his everyman horse will win thanks to his old fashioned @entity19 work ethic			1
' he loves people , he loves what he does and that 's why he 's @entity19 's horse , ' he told @entity70			1
' what he 's doing for two guys that work their butts off every day just to put beans and bacon on the table , this horse has given everybody else out there the incentive to say , " you know what ? we can do it , too			2
" ' @entity2 was backed off the van - he does n't like walking straight off like most horses - and then led into the @entity13 's barn by assistant trainer @entity90			2
' we just hope this horse is letting @entity19 know that the little guy can win , ' @entity14 said			1
' i honestly believe this horse is @entity19 's horse			1
' fast learner : @entity2 strikes a stately pose as he becomes accustomed to the new surroundings at @entity13 in @entity100 , @entity101 left , the horse 's gleeful assistant trainer describes the shock of becoming a champion horse trainer almost overnight @entity2 walked several laps around the barn before being taken outside to pose on the grass for a media horde			2
he later settled into his stall			0
' he likes to stand out here and pose , ' @entity90 said			0
' he loves to get his picture taken			0
he 's a very inquisitive horse			2
he 's always checking out what 's going on around him			0

' this horse did n't cost a ton of money to buy him or breed him			0
this goes to show you never know what can happen in this game			0
' unlikely : @entity2 , ridden by jockey @entity138 , wins the 139th @entity12 horse race at @entity140 in @entity141			1
if he wins at @entity13 , he 'll become the first @entity8 winner since 1978 after already staking claim to one of the sport 's greatest rags - to - riches stories @entity90 assists his 77 - year - old father , @entity149 , who returned to @entity150 after the @entity12			1

general @entity166 ( fourth ) , @entity167 ( fifth ) and @entity168 ( eighth ) are questionable to run in the 1 1/2 - mile race			0
other probables are @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , and @entity174 , the second , third , fourth and fifth - place finishers from the @entity11 ; along with @entity177 and commissioner , who were first and second in the @entity180 at @entity13 ; and @entity181 , 12th in the @entity11			2

the @entity11 and @entity12 - winning horse will compete to become the first to also sweep @entity3 's @entity118 since 1978
