the historical record is chilling			0
early @entity12 colony leader @entity66 wrote of a ' world of miseries , ' that included digging up corpses from their graves to eat when there was nothing else			2
' nothing was spared to maintain life , ' he wrote			0
in one case , a man killed , ' salted , ' and began eating his pregnant wife			0
both @entity66 and capt. @entity79 , the colony 's most famous leader , documented the account in their writings			0
the man was later executed			0
@entity12 was a settlement in the @entity31 , and the first permanent @entity27 settlement in the @entity33 arrival of wives for the settlers at colonial @entity12			1
the colony was established by the @entity35 as ' @entity36 ' on may 14 , 1607 ' one amongst the rest did kill his wife , powdered her , and had eaten part of her before it was known , for which he was executed , as he well deserved , ' @entity79 wrote			2
' now whether she was better roasted , boiled or carbonado 'd ( barbecued ) , i know not , but of such a dish as powdered wife i never heard of			0
' archaeologists at @entity12 and @entity99 in @entity12 were somewhat skeptical of the stories of cannibalism in the past because there was no solid proof , until now			2

' and this is very convincing evidence that it did			0
' @entity23 has been working with @entity110 , the chief archaeologist at @entity12 , since their first burial discovery in 1996			2
the remains of the 14 - year - old girl discovered in the summer of 2012 marks the fourth burial of human remains uncovered at @entity12			1
her remains were found in a cellar at the site that had been filled with trash , including bones of animals that had been consumed , according to archaeologists			2
@entity23 , who has also done forensic analysis for police investigations , analyzed the girl 's remains and how the body had been dismembered , including chops to the front and back of the head			1
the girl was likely already dead at the time			2

@entity23 , who has also done forensic analysis for police investigations , analyzed the girl 's remains and how the body had been dismembered , including chops to the front and back of the head			1
the human remains will be placed on display at @entity12 to explain the ' starving time ' and the horrid conditions early settlers faced			1
at the @entity10 , curators will display a digital reconstruction of the girl 's face to explain the discovery in an exhibit about life at @entity12			1
the skull of ' @entity25 ' is seen with models used to reconstruct her face during a news conference at the @entity9 , wednesday the reconstruction of the female @entity12 colonist was based on a ct scan that allowed a digital reconstructing of her splintered cranium			1
that digital image then became a 3d model of the skull that @entity182 and his team at @entity184 in @entity185 used to create a likeness of her facial features through sculpting and painting			0
numerous small knife cuts and punctures in the mandible of ' @entity25 ' can be clearly seen there was a cultural stigma against killing someone for food , @entity23 said			0
but it was clear to him immediately that there were signs of cannibalism			2
' it is the evidence found on those bones that put it within the context of this time period , " he said			2
' this does represent a clear case of dismemberment of the body and removing of tissues for consumption			0
' it was the work of someone not skilled at butchering , @entity23 said			0
there was a sense of desperation			0
the bones show a bizarre attempt to open the skull			0
four shallow chop marks can be seen on the top of the girl 's skull , found in a basement an 1854 image of the ruins of @entity12 showing the tower of the old @entity230 built in 1639 animal brains and facial tissue would be considered accepted and desirable meat in the 17th century , @entity23 said			1
the human remains will be placed on display at @entity12 to explain the ' starving time ' and the horrid conditions early settlers faced			1
at the @entity10 , curators will display a digital reconstruction of the girl 's face to explain the discovery in an exhibit about life at @entity12			1
the @entity10 and @entity12 archaeologists are also publishing their findings in a book but decided against waiting to announce the discovery through a peer - reviewed journal			1
the @entity251 , a replica of the boat the first settlers arrived on , leads a parade of tall ships into @entity257 for @entity258 2007 as part of the 400th anniversary of the founding of @entity12 a stone cross marking the grave of a 17th century @entity5 settler is seen at the archaeological site of @entity12 @entity23 said archaeology is helping to fill in details from a time when few records were kept - details that wo n't likely be found in history books			1
' it provides a more personal glimpse into the lives and events that these people experienced , ' he said			0
' when you 're dealing with 17th century sites like @entity12 , i think it really enhances what we know about these people			0
