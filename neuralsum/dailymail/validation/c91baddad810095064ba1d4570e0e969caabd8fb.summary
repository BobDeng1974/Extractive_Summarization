an abandoned three - year - old girl from @entity1 who was refused by many couples seeking to adopt because she did n't have a nose has finally found a new home			1
@entity5 , 44 , from @entity6 , adopted little @entity7 after a number of couples refused her because insects had eaten away her nose when she was abandoned at birth			1
but @entity7 has now started a new life in @entity14 , with her eight - year - old sister @entity15 , who @entity5 also adopted from @entity1 in 2012			1
@entity5 , a teacher from @entity14 , adopted little @entity7 who was abandoned at work causing her nose to be eaten by insects @entity5 said : ‘ i look at my girls and i ’m so happy			1
i had set out to adopt a child but this journey has brought me so much more			0
' i feel so much love for my girls			0
they ’re my world and i ca n’t wait to start our lives together			0
to call them my family just fills me with joy			0
’ @entity5 , who is still single having never met the right man , started her adoption journey in @entity31 , in 2010			1
but the following year the @entity32 suddenly suspended all adoptions with the country			0
so @entity5 was introduced to @entity1 and very quickly came across little @entity15 who had been in an orphanage since 2009			1
she said : ‘ i was looking through the lists and lists of children up for adoption on my computer screen from an agency and there were just so many			0
' it was heartbreaking to see how many girls need a loving home in @entity1			2
but i suddenly felt this pull for this little girl			0
' her name was munni and she was just five years old at the time			0
i do n’t know what it was but we connected			0
i just knew she was my daughter , i felt we had to be together and i got the ball rolling			0
’ @entity7 was abandoned at birth , since then many parents have rejected her because of her deformity @entity5 says that she has taken some time off work so that she can help both @entity7 and @entity15 settle in to their new homes over the next two years @entity5 was put through paper work and court processes in order to adopt @entity15 , but she never gave up			1
‘ i knew i wanted @entity15 in my life so i did everything in my power to make it happen , ’ she added			1
‘ i was n’t giving up on her no matter how long it took			0
’ eventually in december 2012 @entity5 met @entity15 for the first time			1
@entity5 came to know that @entity15 had a scar on her forehead in the shape of a horseshoe but no one could tell her how it got there			1
@entity15 was quiet and withdrawn but @entity5 felt nothing but love for her			1
and on 14 february , 2013 , @entity5 finally became @entity15 ’s adopted mother			1
she said : ‘ i call her my forever valentine because it was all finalised on @entity81			0
' it was such a special day			0
she opened my eyes to so much			0
and i knew i wanted to adopt a little sister or brother for @entity15			1
’ @entity5 , who works as a secondary school teacher in @entity89 , told her adoption agency as soon as she arrived that that she wanted to adopt again			1
and they promised to keep her notified of availabilities			0
@entity5 proudly shows off her girls @entity15 and @entity7 having adopted both of the little girls from @entity1 the adoption process relies heavily on agencies and its caseworkers matching prospective parents with children			1
and it was @entity5 ’s caseworker that told her about @entity7			1
she had been abandoned in a bush at birth and insects or animals had eaten away her nose			1
apparently the police found her clinging to life and took her to a nearby clinic in @entity112 , in @entity113 , western @entity1			2
chances of her survival were slim , but she fought on			0
eventually she made a full recovery and she started her life in an orphanage			0
but there was no funding or money available for treatment to her nose			0
@entity7 had spent all her life with no nose			2
when @entity5 first saw a photo , she did n’t hesitate			2
she said yes immediately and knew that @entity7 would be happy with her and @entity15 , ‘ i remember that @entity15 and i were driving home from the part one day and my case worker called saying : " we have a little girl for you and you ’d be a perfect family for her " , and i told her to send her information over immediately , ’ @entity5 remembered			1
as soon as @entity5 and @entity15 walked through the door they logged on to the computer and @entity7 ’s face smiled back at them			1
@entity5 said : ‘ i cried straight away			2
this gorgeous little girl with such beautiful eyes had suffered so much			0
@entity15 looked at her photo and said : ‘ is that my little sister ? ’			2
the case worker asked if i needed 24 hours to think about it but i said no , not needed			0
’ @entity15 is a proud big sister to @entity7 , both little girls were adopted from @entity1 but now live in @entity14 with their mother , @entity5 the adoption process meant @entity7 was then locked to @entity5 and no other prospective parent could meet her			1
but @entity7 had been refused by many couple because of her missing nose			2
@entity152 , the superintendent of @entity153 , in @entity113 , said @entity7 arrived at the care centre in september 2011 , weighing just 1lb 3oz and was just a day old			2
‘ her nose was badly nibbled by insects and she was very weak and we were afraid she would n’t survive			2
we tried our best to take good care of her and we used to feed her with cotton balls soaked in milk			1
‘ we named her @entity7			2
for three years we tried our best to find a home for her			0
three couples that initially volunteered eventually rejected her because of her nose			0
then we contacted an agency licensed with foreign adoptions			0
finally @entity5 ’s agency got in touch			2
’ there have been only six children at the centre and more than 25 families are waiting to adopt a baby but none of them wanted to adopt @entity7			1
‘ we ’re so happy for @entity7 that she now has a mother and a wonderful new life in the @entity32			2
she ’s very cute and lovely child			0
@entity5 has assured us @entity7 will be happy and she said she will bring her back to meet us when she ’s older			1
’ @entity5 has now taken eight months off work to spend time helping @entity7 settle into her new home			1
she said her parents , her older sister who has four children , and brother in law , have been a big support and having embraced both @entity15 and @entity7 as members of the family			1
@entity5 has also been to see surgeons in @entity14 to discuss @entity7 ’s nose and when she ’s older - at around seven - she will be able to start the process of having a new nose			1
‘ @entity15 is over the moon with her little sister , ’ @entity5 added			1
‘ she ’s the doting older sister already			0
she wo n’t want to go to school in case she misses out but we need to get a nice family routine going so life can become as normal as possible for @entity7			2
’ @entity5 would still like to marry one day but said any man she meets needs to be completely happy becoming a father to her girls			0
‘ it will take a very special man to take all three of us on			0
i ’ll never say never , of course i would love for them to have a father , but i ’ll be very careful about who enters our lives			0

orphanage staff kept her alive feeding her cotton balls soaked in milk
