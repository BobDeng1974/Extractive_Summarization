@entity1 ’s wealthiest mp @entity0 hands loaves of bread to local villagers through the window of his mansion house			1
the bizarre tradition emerged after the heir to a £ 125million family fortune lectured poor families for wasting food			1
the environment minister claimed too many people do not store fruit and vegetables correctly and could cut their shopping bills if they read food labels properly			1
he faced claims the government ’s answer to poverty was to tell struggling families : ‘ let them eat leftovers			1

the former solider is valued at £ 110million as the son of sir @entity42 , a former @entity43 mp who owns the @entity44 in @entity33 and is said to be worth £ 125million			1
nestled on the estate is @entity32 , which once a year stages the tradition of the landlord handing food to local people through a window			2
it dates back to 1581 when owner lady @entity52 was rescued by villagers after getting lost in the woods			0
to thank those who came to her aid she began presenting bread and yards of cloth to the local poor every @entity59 thursday			0
she left money in her will for the tradition to continue for ' the poore of @entity32 '			0
the @entity65 manor house is used by an educational trust , but as landlord mr @entity0 played the part of lord of the manor for this picture in 2012			2
the government has been stung by criticism that it is out of touch after mr @entity0 claimed the average family wastes food worth £ 50 - a - month			1
the minister suggested people were wrong to keep fruit in a bowl and instead should be packed in the fridge mr @entity0 , who is the heir to the @entity44 near @entity80 in @entity33 , was accused of being out of touch mr @entity0 told @entity81 : ‘ we have been needlessly throwing away enormous amounts of food when it is perfectly safe to eat it			1
@entity0 lists cooking among his interests in his @entity90 entry			2
but his comments about food waste in the kitchen have landed him in hot water			0
the ministerial advice on how to store food is made more politically damaging by the fact that the 49 - year - old was today named as @entity1 's richest mp			1
as the heir to the heir to former mp sir @entity42 , he stands to inherit some £ 110million from the vast 20,000 acres @entity44 in @entity33			1
born in october 1960 , he attended @entity102 , a public school which counts former foreign secretary @entity103 , cricketer @entity104 and comedian @entity105 among its old boys			0

in 2004 he married @entity115 and the couple have two sons			0
he was elected @entity43 mp for @entity119 in 2005			0
a shooting and fishing enthusiast , he has courted controversy since becoming an environment minister in 2010 , including sanctioning a cull of buzzards , selling off forests and cutting flood defences			0
‘ @entity128 wasted means fewer pounds in our pocket			0
household bills are squeezed at the moment and we have the opportunity through a variety of different agencies to inform people better about where their food comes from and how to use it most economically			2
’ challenged about the comments , prime minister @entity139 told the @entity141 : ‘ obviously , that does not look good			1
’ but he suggested the comments had been taken out of context			0
during a @entity145 debate on food waste , mr @entity0 went on to issue a raft of advice to families on how to store food at home			1
‘ keeping most fruit in the fridge in its packaging can keep it fresher for a week or more , but around 60 per cent of us take fruit out of the packaging , and more than 70 per cent of us do not store it in the fridge			2
‘ re-closing packs of cheese and sliced meats helps to stop them drying out in the fridge , but 13 per cent of us apparently store such food unwrapped in the fridge			2
‘ we can all pay attention to the storage information on food packaging , which will help us to store food at home so that it keeps fresher for longer			2
’ however , rising food prices have been blamed for piling pressure on families			2
official figures today show fruit prices are more than 10 per cent higher than last year with vegetable costs up 6.7 per cent			0
@entity43 mp @entity174 said : ‘ i do n’t think it is right for the government to preach to people who choose to purchase food and use that food			1
‘ nobody likes waste and families on low incomes often buy in bulk because it can be cheaper			0
no one in those families are wasting food intentionally , ’ he told the @entity180			1
@entity189 , assistant general secretary of the @entity190 , said : ‘ of course we should cut down on food waste but @entity1 ’s families need a change of economic policy rather than domestic science lessons from cosseted ministers			2
‘ mr @entity0 is out of touch with the squeeze on living standards if he thinks careful fridge management will bring relief			1
it ’s austerity that ’s past its sell - by date			0
’ @entity205 , @entity207 ’s shadow environment , secretary , said : ' mums struggling to feed their families do n't need lectures on wrapping cheese from a @entity43 government which has created a cost of living crisis with its failed economic plan			1
' people are cutting back on food , eating less fresh meat , fruit and vegetables and foodbanks can barely cope			1
' this out of touch @entity212 's response to the cost of living crisis is condescension and a tax cut for millionaires			0
' prime minister @entity139 told the @entity141 the comments do ' not look good ' but suggested they had been taken out of context mr @entity139 , pictured as he speaks with workers during a visit to a small building site in @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity236 , insisted the government was working to help people on low incomes official figures show how food prices have risen sharply in the last 12 months and @entity207 mp @entity242 added : ‘ this @entity43 minister ’s answer to rising poverty is basically , ' let them eat leftovers ’			1
it ’s another crass , patronising and out - of - touch lecture from a minister			0
” but mr @entity139 insisted the government was working to help people on low incomes			0
the @entity139 said : ‘ the real truth here is we need to help families with their household bills , that ’s why we ’re freezing the council tax for the third year in a row , that ’s why we ’ve delivered a tax cut for 24m working people by lifting the amount you can earn before you start paying tax , that ’s why we ’ve cancelled fuel duty increase , we ’ve cut the duty on beer , we ’re getting behind working families who work hard and want to do the right thing and that is what we ’re doing			0
