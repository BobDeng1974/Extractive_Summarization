just a couple of days after playing as an emergency striker against @entity2 , @entity0 has proved his versatility as an actor by starring in @entity7 's latest @entity6 video			1
inspired by the popular parody @entity9 account @ @entity10 , which portrays the @entity12 midfielder as football 's dullest player , the new clip sees the 28 - year - old welcome kit man @entity15 into his ' home ' for @entity6			1
set in a meeting room at @entity7 's new @entity18 , @entity0 is filmed opening presents from his family - all of which are wrapped in plain brown paper as he ' does n't like too much colour '			1
@entity0 is disappointed with his ' foreign ' @entity25 tea bags as he was hoping for @entity26 the @entity7 midfielder shows off a card from his former team - mate @entity29 @entity0 talks about his ' amazing day ' with the @entity30 and prince @entity31 in @entity33 's @entity6 video reading a book entitled ' @entity35 ' when he hears a knock on the door , @entity0 's other reading material includes literature on @entity41 sculpture and calorie counting			1
but having sent a @entity6 list to his family - all of whom share similar names - @entity0 is soon settling down alongside @entity7 's popular kit man @entity47 to open his gifts			1
first up is a box of @entity25 tea bags from his uncle @entity51 , although @entity52 is left perplexed by the brand			1
' @entity55 foreign is n't it ? ' he says			2
' thought it was only @entity59 tea that did tea bags			1
i 've never heard of them			2
' @entity0 then shows off a plain white christmas card - with the words ' @entity6 ' in black font on the front - from his former team - mate @entity29			1
' he 's a good mate , ' @entity0 says of the @entity67 midfielder			1
' he 's a hoot - we have some great text conversations			0
' @entity0 opens @entity6 presents alongside @entity7 kit man @entity15 @entity0 reads a book entitled ' @entity35 ' before @entity15 arrives to open his presents next up is a set of dumpling moulds from @entity77			1
' that was n't on my list but me and @entity77 had a detailed conversation a few weeks ago about dumplings and how it 's so hard to get them spherical , ' @entity0 explains			1
continuing to live up to the @ @entity10 account , which has over 360,000 followers , @entity0 shows off a mocked - up picture of him with the @entity30 and prince @entity31 , declaring : ' it was an amazing day			1
as you can see everyone was having a whale of a time			0
it was one of the funniest days i 've had			0
' an eraser , pencil and sharpener from his @entity96 then appear to make @entity0 's day as the former @entity98 midfielder excitedly says : ' that 's going to come in handy			1
they get a bit giddy with pink ones these days but you ca n't beat a white rubber			2
' ' ooh , shall i try it out ? it 's going through nice and smooth - sometimes you can get those jittery ones			0
it 's come out beautiful			0
' but @entity0 is left confused when he opens five pairs of feel fresh socks from his auntie @entity112 , all of which are emblazoned with the days of the week			2
' what about saturday and sunday ? ' he says			0
' it does throw me off			0
i really enjoyed wearing them [ last year ]			0
@entity0 tests out his new pencil sharpener and is impressed with the ' beautiful ' shavings produced @entity121 displays his new nine - inch shovel which he 'll use to clear leaves outside his house ' but when i was taking my washing up and down the stairs i dropped one and it was n't clean in time			1
i had to wear one tuesday and one wednesday			0
it was a day we were travelling to @entity131 and i nearly fell down the stairs on to the plane because my right foot was moving quicker than my left			0
i might be running around in circles if i 'm wearing different socks			0
' fortunately @entity0 's special day ended on a high when he received a new shovel from his @entity140			2
' marvellous , ' he says after unwrapping his final present			0
i 've been waiting for this one			0
' i did n't want to use last year 's shovel - it does n't feel right			2
it 's a nine - inch one as well which is n't too big but you can use it with one hand			2
' the @entity12 man proves he has a kind heart too by handing over a gift to former @entity153 - a handheld steam cleaner			0
' it 's my old one but i 've kept it pristine , ' @entity0 adds			2
' you 'll have hours of fun with it			0
' @entity160 here to @entity163 's facebook page			0
@entity15 and @entity0 enjoy a laugh in one of several outtakes from @entity7 's latest @entity6 video			1
