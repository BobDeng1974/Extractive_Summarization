by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 23 july 2012 updated : 10:44 est , 23 july 2012 workers at a train company expected to ferry thousands of spectators to @entity5 sailing events are to take industrial action during the @entity5 in a row over pay			1
the announcement from @entity10 comes just days after the company 's director urged spectators travelling to sailing events in @entity15 not to use their services and go by car instead			1
up to 1,000 train drivers and other staff at @entity10 will now work to rule and have backed a ban on overtime starting on friday			2
thousands of sailing fans are expected to descend on historic @entity15 in @entity23 , pictured the industrial action - which is due to end on august 12 , the last day of the @entity5 - is expected to cause travel chaos as thousands of visitors flock to the @entity23 coast			1
members of the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 rejected the option of an outright strike but voted instead for different forms of action which may lead to significant disruption			0
the managing director of the company @entity37 said he was upset by the planned industrial action			2
' it is disappointing the @entity41 seems intent on trying to disrupt services at such an important time for our customers and the country , ' he said			0
' their attempts to renege on the deal they agreed have gone down badly with the public and @entity41 members also voted against strike action over this issue			0
' despite the @entity41 action announced today , we can confirm we will be running a full service for our passengers during the @entity5 so they can get to and from the @entity60 events			2
up to 1,000 railway staff at @entity10 will now work to rule and have backed a ban on overtime to coincide with the start of the @entity5 fans going to @entity15 to cheer on three - times gold medalist @entity66 , pictured , are being warned to drive and not rely on the train network ' we ’re pleased that most of our employees have voted against taking a strike during the @entity5			1
' this means we can deliver our full @entity5 train service and ensure our passengers can enjoy the excitement of @entity60 , a once in a lifetime experience			1
' as we have said all along , the @entity41 agreed to a generous pay deal some months ago , which covered the period of the @entity60 ' but mr @entity37 earlier warned power supply issues would mean that the company would be operating diesel services			2
' because of the power supply problem ... the park - and - ride is the primary way people are being advised to get to @entity15 for the sailing , ' he told the @entity83			1
@entity41 general secretary @entity84 , said : ' although we have secured good deals on @entity5 recognition and reward for the vast majority of our members , we still have a small number of employers holding out and refusing to offer a fair deal			0
' we can not accept that blatant unfairness and the time has come for these employers to seize the opportunity , get round the table and sign off agreements that recognise the additional work and pressures that these staff will be carrying			0
' up to 80,000 extra passengers every day are expected to use the @entity104 train network during the @entity5 , as gold medal hopefuls including three - times @entity5 winner @entity66 take part in the sailing competitions in @entity15			1
thousands of spectators are expected to flock to @entity15 on the @entity23 coast to watch @entity5 sailing events there were severe delays today on one of the key tube lines that will ferry people to the @entity5			1
the problem was at @entity119 close to the @entity5 site at @entity121			0
it meant long hold ups on the jubilee line in the early part of the morning rush hour			0
the delays also affected passengers on the @entity129 - another key @entity5 route			1
drivers coming into @entity132 today also experienced delays of up to 90 minutes			1
a lane restriction on the @entity135 at @entity136 in west @entity132 caused backlogs on the @entity138			1
the lane alterations are part of the preparation for the full introduction on wednesday of the @entity5 traffic - only @entity144 in @entity132			1
the 30 miles of lanes are part of the 109 - mile @entity147 designed to allow athletes and officials to travel around the capital			0
despite mr @entity37 's assurances , however , meltdown could occur if a larger number of spectators than anticipated decide to travel by public transport to the south west			0
almost £ 100m has gone towards improving roads in the area close to @entity15 , but the railway network - which for part of the route still has a single track - has received no new investment			2
as well as contending with difficulties getting to the pretty seaside town , spectators may also struggle to put their feet up when they do arrive in @entity15 - due to a ban on folding chairs			2
@entity15 's @entity168 are an ideal vantage point to see the sailing out in the bay and has a steep bank where spectators will sit , but officials have banned chairs there because of safety fears			0
a @entity60 spokesman said : ' for health and safety reasons fold - up chairs are not permitted in the @entity168 which is an exposed and steeply banked site			0
' we were clear about the site specifications at the point of sale , however , we will have limited fixed seating available for those that most require it			0

the industrial action - timed to last for the entire duration of the @entity5 - will mean train workers will do the bare *minimum* work
*decision* comes after the boss of @entity10 had earlier warned sailing fans to use the park - and - ride to get to @entity15
travel chaos expected on the key @entity5 train route which has received no extra *funding* for the @entity5
traffic problems have already started around @entity132 after lane restrictions caused 90 minute delays on the @entity138 today
