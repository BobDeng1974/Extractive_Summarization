by @entity0 the effects of zero gravity on our muscles , bones and joints have been extensively studied			0
but while living in space is known to weaken our immune system , no one is sure how our cells are affected in the long - term by prolonged exposure to a weightless environment			1
now a new @entity15 experiment will seek to answer that very question , and it could provide us with important information on the risk of spaceflight to astronauts			1
an iss experiment known as the @entity22 will test how @entity23 ( pictured ) , cells that are important to our immune system , are impaired by being in a zero gravity environment known as the @entity22 , the experiment was carried to the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) by @entity29 ’s @entity28 , which berthed with the station yesterday			1
it will be run by a team from the @entity34 ’s @entity33 , led by professor @entity35			0
the experiment contains a cargo of immune cells			1
in zero gravity , various immune system functions are known to be impaired			1
in particular phagocytes , cells that protect our body from harmful foreign bodies , are unable to work properly			0
the unmanned @entity28 from the private @entity47 firm @entity29 successfully reached the @entity15 yesterday			1
it is the third scheduled cargo mission for the capsule to the @entity15 , known as @entity50 - 3 , and its fourth visit in total			1
the capsule has delivered 2.2 tons of cargo including food and 150 experiments to the astronauts on board			0
it will spend several weeks attached to the station before returning to @entity61 with finished experiments and waste			0
they ca n't reliably protect astronauts from infections , which is why even minor contamination can be a problem			0
professor @entity35 will be studying the structure and metabolism of these phagocytes while they are on the @entity15 over three days , they will be studied to determine if zero gravity has any lasting effects on these important cells			2
the researchers want to know whether , when astronauts ultimately return to @entity61 , their immune systems are irrevocably damaged from the trip to space			2
previous experiments with limited zero gravity , including parabolic aircraft flights and research rockets , have shown that cells respond to the absence of gravity within seconds			0
key molecular functions for cell - to - cell communication and cell migration are immediately impaired			0
the mission was carried to the @entity96 spacecraft , pictured , which successfully berthed yesterday ‘ conducting research on the @entity15 is as if – after studying many trees one by one – you climb a mountain to see the whole forest , ’ professor @entity35 explains in a release			1
the experiment is not only delving into modern human biology , however			0
the team will also be hoping to discover if certain conditions , such as having gravity , are crucial for the development of complex multicellular life			0
this could provide information on whether @entity61 is the ideal place for life evolve or if , even in space , cells can adapt to their environment			1
‘ conducting research in space enables us to understand life on @entity61 better , ’ explains professor @entity35			2
but , if nothing else , the @entity22 will provide key data to gauge the risk to astronauts on future spaceflights .			2

an experiment known as the @entity22 has been taken to the @entity15
it was *transported* to the station yesterday by the @entity96 cargo *vehicle*
the mission will study how our immune system copes in zero gravity
it will help us fully understand the risks of spaceflight on the human body
but it could also provide information as to whether life can begin in space
