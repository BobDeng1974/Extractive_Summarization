@entity5 fires home to put @entity0 1 - 0 up against @entity1 early on in the match @entity21 congratulates @entity5 after his opening goal put @entity0 in a commanding position @entity24 ( left ) and @entity5 celebrate after the latter 's goal in the opening stages of the game @entity0 : @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity24 ( @entity34 64 ) , @entity35 , @entity21 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 64 ) , @entity5 subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 goal : @entity5 9 booked : @entity36 82 @entity1 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 71 ) , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity8 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ( @entity56 67 ) , @entity57 ( long 75 ) subs not used : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity31 goal : @entity8 25 booked : @entity54 37 , @entity8 52 , @entity52 81 , @entity47 84 referee : @entity64 attendance : 20,132 both sides made a bright start and it lit up even more for the home side when they took the lead in the ninth minute when @entity5 got his 22nd of the season after nine minutes			1
@entity24 's deep corner was nodded towards goal by @entity32 and the league 's leading marksman was on hand to cleverly poke the ball home off the inside of the post			0
@entity5 almost grabbed his second when he took advantage of dithering from @entity49 and @entity46 to take the ball away from the @entity1 goalkeeper - but he could only find the side - netting from a near - impossible angle			1
the home side were on top with @entity36 narrowly missing the far post with a fierce cross-cum - shot while , at the other end , @entity0 keeper @entity91 did well to hold @entity54 's curling effort from the edge of the area			2
however , @entity1 were level when @entity91 did brilliantly to parry @entity97 ' volley but @entity8 was on hand to head home the rebound			0
@entity8 lifts a finger to the sky in celebration after levelling the match at @entity4 @entity0 's @entity105 ( centre ) plays the ball out of trouble after being surrounded by @entity1 men an even final 20 minutes of the first half saw the visitors shade the chances , @entity55 heading over from 10 yards and then @entity57 's snapshot whistling past the post			1
@entity0 almost grabbed the lead just before the interval when a great breakaway saw @entity24 's shot well saved by @entity46 , before @entity55 made a brave sliding block to deny @entity36 the rebound			0
the home side should have been ahead less than a minute after the restart when @entity36 broke into the box and perfectly crossed for @entity5 who somehow slid the ball over the bar - and the gaping empty net - from five yards out			0
@entity1 's @entity49 reacts to a missed chance during the @entity3 match on saturday afternoon @entity35 ( left ) brings the ball forward as @entity0 search for a winner , but they were unable to find one in a chance reminiscent of @entity36 's in the first half , @entity32 could only push a good chance wide of the far post on 54 minutes			2
@entity46 remained the busier of the two keepers and he had to be alert to dive across his goal to save from @entity33			0
back came @entity1 with @entity54 's free - kick well held by @entity91 before @entity5 missed another gilt - edged chance on 65 minutes when the striker raced clear but was denied by a brilliant save from the onrushing @entity46			2
@entity0 continued to create the better chances as the second half progressed , with @entity5 's shot at @entity46 lacking power and then sub @entity38 heading wide under pressure			0
eight minutes before the end , @entity34 tricked his way through the defence but his low left foot shot was brilliantly saved by man of the match @entity46			0
@entity54 looks to the referee after being brought down during the tense affair in @entity0 @entity1 boss @entity157 , who has recently been in the headlines , gives his team instructions @entity19 , whose @entity0 side are flying high , watches on from the side of the pitch			2

going into the game , @entity1 were sixth and @entity0 were *seventh*
@entity5 opened the scoring early on for @entity0 at @entity4
@entity8 cancelled out the opening goal to make it 1 - 1
neither side could grab a winner and the two sides had to *settle* for a point
