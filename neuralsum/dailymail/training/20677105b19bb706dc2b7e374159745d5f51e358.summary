the electric car being showcased as a replacement for horse - drawn carriage rides in @entity4 's @entity3 has been revealed			1
the @entity5 , a classic looking motor with leather seats , running boards and green livery , was shown off at the @entity10 on thursday			2
although it is advocated as a humane alternative to the horses that have been taking tourists round the park for decades , the @entity11 has not yet won over critics			2
horseless carriage : the electric car , designed to look like a classic motor , is being offered as an alternative the prototype of the car was commissioned by campaign group @entity23 , which claims horse - drawn carriage rides in such a busy city are cruel			1
the group 's proposed alternative is an open - top car that can seat eight people and is made to look like it is from the early @entity31 , with plenty of brass trimmings and over-sized wheels			1
its creator , @entity35 of car restoration business @entity38 , said the selling price could be between $ 150,000 and $ 175,000			0
@entity35 called the car ' a homage ' to an earlier time , with a body shape that ' reflects and celebrates an era that 's of amazing historical significance to this city '			2
but before the cars could make their way to the streets around @entity3 , legislation banning the carriage horses would have to be passed			0
parp ! parp ! : the brass trimmings and green livery make the @entity11 look like something @entity54 would drive crafted : dials and knobs on the dashboard are in keeping with the classical theme mayor @entity59 wants to ban the horses			1
but carriage - horse operators and their allies - including actor @entity63 - have opposed the plan , and the council has not yet introduced the legislation			1
@entity63 , who has lived in the city for 20 years , defended the ' proud ' workers and their spotless record for looking after their animals			1
in a strongly - worded piece in the @entity72 recently , he stated that ' an entire way of life and a historic industry are under threat '			0
the actor went on to defend the safety record of the handlers and their horses , saying : ' @entity4 â€™s horse carriages have made an estimated six million trips in traffic over the last 30 years			1
' in that time , just four horses have been killed as a result of collisions with motor vehicles , with no human fatalities			0
' driver 's seat : @entity35 designed the @entity5 for @entity23 which is campaigning to ban horses from @entity3 iconic : the @entity11 was designed to evoke an historically important era in @entity4 the @entity92 , a nonprofit that oversees the park in partnership with the city , was also against the idea of bringing more cars into the popular place			1
' forty million people visit @entity3 each year , including runners , bicyclists , kids and dog owners , ' @entity99 , president and chief executive of the conservancy , said			0
' adding vehicles to the mix will make the park less safe for all of them and increase congestion			0
' @entity35 said the cars would be able to go up to 30mph outside of the park , but would be kept electronically from going more than 5mph inside it			0
asked about the conservancy 's opposition , @entity59 said he thought it was a ' misunderstanding ' of what 's being proposed			1
controversial : mayor @entity59 's campaign to end horse - drawn carriage rides has met criticism moving on : those backing the campaign say the @entity11 , which will not travel faster than 5mph , is a safer and more humane way to take in views of the park ' right now , besides the fact that the horse carriages are not humane - there have been a number of accidents involving carriages - the routes we 're talking about would be the same as our existing routes , ' he said			1
' you 're talking about electric cars for tourists that go slow on purpose because they should go slow and because tourists want to see things			0
' that 's very different from other issues about cars in parks , and it is a cleaner , better , more humane approach , that obviously will also provide employment opportunities and will be good for our tourism industry			2
' he had previously called the rides cruel and outdated , and said they should no longer be ' a part of the landscape of @entity4 '			2
city councilmember @entity159 said legislation was still being crafted , with the specifics of how those who hold licenses for the carriage horses could get the vehicles and how it would be paid for still to be determined			0
he insisted there were enough votes for legislation to pass .			0

prototype of electric motor was on show at @entity4 's @entity174
animal rights group backed by mayor @entity59 say it is more humane
@entity92 and those fighting carriage ban - including actor @entity63 - are not *convinced*
