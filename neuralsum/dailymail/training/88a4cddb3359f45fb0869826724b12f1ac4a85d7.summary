it 's time to dump those dumbbells boys as a new survey has revealed that having a muscular physique will get you nowhere when it comes to dating apps			2
a study has revealed that women who use @entity9 are more likely to swipe right to metrosexual men than beefed up bodies			1
the results also found that women are likely to shun other stereotypes such as a hipster , rocker or ' lad ' in favour of a vainer man			1
four male profiles were created for each stereotype , gym buff , rocker , lad and metrosexual using the same model			1
each profile ran from the same location in @entity39 , @entity40 , for a fortnight with the @entity9 age range set as 18 - 35 and the distance was set to 18km ( 11.1 miles ) for each of the five profiles			1
not so hot : the gym buff ranked worst out of the group with just 42 matches over the course of the two weeks that the profiles were live , the names , ages and messages from each woman that matched with the men were documented			1
the mature metrosexual account received 241 matches ( 39.4 per cent )			2
the average age of the potential partners was 23 - and - a - half years old			2
meanwhile women are the least keen on the gym buff type , whose profile only received 42 matches ( 6.8 per cent )			1
the research revealed that women are more likely to swipe right to a man who is well groomed the typical @entity66 - the - lad still remains a popular choice for the ladies , with 124 women expressing their desire to meet up with the model in the lad account			1
the cool , smoking hipster received 105 matches while the fashionable rocker attracted 99 matches on the dating app. relationship expert @entity78 says that the appeal of the metrosexual is simply down to good old - fashioned aesthetics			1
' metrosexuals are easily spotted in a crowd because they look good			0
they probably have enough products in their bathroom to rival boots and it definitely shows , because this man likes to look his best at all times			0
' @entity78 added that although women are initially attracted to well - groomed types they can prove problematic when it comes to actual relationships			1
' the obvious down sides can be vanity and fights over bathroom time ( and products )			0
' however she also pointed out that if his approach to relationships is similar to his dedication to his appearance , he could make a promising partner			0
' if his attention to detail flows over into other areas of his life , he 'll be an attentive boyfriend who cares about the little things , from taking your coat to buying you thoughtful gifts			0
' if you also take pride in your appearance and value setting off to the more prestigious places to eat , drink and spend your holidays , you 'll be a perfect fit			0
' @entity78 says that when it comes to impressing the well - turned - out man they look for a similar level of upkeep with their women			2
' generally speaking , metrosexual men are drawn to women that let their femininity out and are essentially the glam version of the girl next door			2
' take it or leave it : the rocker ( left ) received 99 matches while the trendy hipster ( right ) ranked up 105 popular choice : the typical jack the lad image came in second with 141 women expressing interest @entity78 added that daters are probably making the right choice if they have a penchant for pristine men as gym bunnies tend to put their women second			1
' if you 're not happy catering to the gym buff 's meal plans and coming second to the weights , treadmills and cross trainers , he 's probably not for you			1
' gym buffs are most definitely suited to girls who like to keep fit , as they will be able to co-ordinate schedules and push each other to do their best and stay in shape			0
' having to fit his gym sessions into daily life might be a chore at times			0
' when it comes to the ' lad ' , @entity78 says that there family values and sociable nature can make them a suitable mate			0
' extremely friend and family orientated , with the right girl , the " lad " can be the right guy			0
' his friends will be at his core - from trips to see his football team play to saturday nights largely being reserved for the weekly " big night out " - meaning he will of course suit a lady with a similar lifestyle , who is n't waiting at home for a text and fretting over what he 's up to			0
' it is n't all glugging beers and chanting at the football , though , because he 'll probably be very close to his family behind all the bravado			0

women prefer well - groomed men over those with a ' buff ' physique
the experiment saw a model create four fake @entity9 profiles
