by @entity0 she has clearly not left her days as a ballerina behind her			1
and as she limbers up , 88 - year - old dame @entity2 displays the same level of agility she had when she was in her 20s			1
and despite having two metal hips and a foot that is held together by nails , the former @entity7 star is releasing a workout dvd of the exercises , so that other ‘ oldies ’ , as she likes to refer to herself , can keep fit			1
inspired by her lengthy career as a dancer , choreographer and director , including on the hit musical @entity32 , @entity2 has created the exercises to help older women improve their suppleness and wellbeing			1
and she made it with her husband @entity37 , 60 , because she realised there was nothing on the market for older women			1
she said : ‘ i hate these video tapes for fitness because they ’re always with girls with this hanging out and that hanging out and they ’re shouting “ one , two , three four ” and it ’s just , that ’s not a way to get an oldie going			1
the whole point of this is for oldies , i have n’t made it for young ones , but for oldies it ’s very , very useful ’ from curved - back squats which release the spine , to touching your knee with your nose , the former @entity7 star said the exercises are achievable for women of any age			1
and they are best done before breakfast , @entity2 said , to get the blood flowing around the body			1
as well as her morning work out routine , @entity2 sticks to a strict died to stay healthy and in shape the routine is inspired by @entity2 's career as a dancer , choreographer and director every morning , @entity2 exercises for 40 minutes before doing anything else with her day first you loosen up the spine and the side			1
you do that by standing and releasing your back			2
you stand with your feet hip width apart , bum in and you start to lower			2
then you release the back and when you get all the way down to the floor you straighten the legs			2
and then you come up , bone by bone by bone			2
when you are back to standing , shrug your shoulders , again and again and again and shake it all out			2
next , tense up all your muscles , think about how everything went wrong yesterday and you say “ it does n’t matter ” and let it all out			2
make a box with your arms , like a picture , and twist round to the left side , and round to the right side , keeping the hips square			2
now you ’re ready to get on the floor			2
sitting on the floor bring your feet in together to touch , so your legs are making a diamond shape and press down gently on the knees			1
that helps to open up the crotch muscles			2
then lying down on your back , imagine you ’re on a pulley and pull yourself up and back down again			2
that ’s working all the way along the core			0
do about 8 of them with a curved back and then do it again with a straight back			0
sitting up , open the legs as wide as they will go and then crawl your hands along the floor so that your torso gets as close to the floor as possible			0
do the same on each leg , walking your way down to the toes			0
then bend the legs and twist them , so the left is bent in front of you and the right slightly to your side			0
twist the torso and open up the arms like train signals			0
then you bring the right arm to the left knee and follow it with your whole body , say “ good morning knee ” and repeat on the other side			0
finally , taken from yoga , hug the legs close to you and rock backwards and forwards as hard as you can			0
that ’s a really good one for shaking it all up			0
like any good teacher , of course , @entity2 follows the programme rigorously herself			1
and on any given morning she can be found in her living room , going through a 40 - minute routine of stretches and toning exercises with mr @entity37 – who joins her under duress , she joked			1
‘ i get up , i do my breathing exercises , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ i get my back going , i get my waist twisting			0
it ’s difficult for me to get on the floor , i ’ve got two metal hips and a foot that has got nails to keep it together			0
so i do n’t just fall , i go slowly , but even then it ’s very ungainly , with my hip , it looks terrible			0
but i thought no , we have to leave it [ in the dvd ] , because if oldies see it , they ’ve probably got something that ’s gone			1
then there ’s a lot of floor work , inspired by @entity32			0
and it ’s all been woven in with the jazz work i do and the classical			0
’ as well as her exercises , @entity2 follows a strict diet , which is a throw - back to her days on the @entity186 starts her mornings with a glass of hot lime – lemon is too acidic for her dancer ’s joints – and after her work out she eats a breakfast of crushed kiwi , gluten - free oats , cinnamon and cayenne pepper , all topped with some water and baked in the oven			1
lunch and dinner will be a baked potato and salad or veal escalope with green vegetables – she follows the @entity208 and never mixes carbohydrates and protein			0
and she never eats fruit after 6pm , while sugar is strictly prohibited			0
it is a regime she has followed for most of her adult life , making small changes along the way as she has aged			0
in fact the only time she relented from it was last year when she suffered a particularly severe bout of pneumonia , which saw her physically unable to exercise and at one point coming close to death			1
around the same time she appeared in a documentary about older women , in which she performed some of the exercises she follows			1
and after being inundated by letters from viewers wanting to know more about her routine , @entity2 decided to make the dvd			1
she said : ‘ what it led to was all the ancient people looking at me , because i do some exercises that are perfectly normal to me , wake up work out , which i have to do every day of my life otherwise i would n’t be able to do my job			1
i need to keep fit , limber			0
and it led to a whole spate of letters from older people saying “ is n’t there something for us ? this is what we want , we do n’t want all that other stuff ”			1
’ ‘ although it ’s quite obvious that i am not young , i do n’t look as old as i am either , ’ added the @entity249 , who became known as the ‘ wartime ballerina ’ after beginning her career aged 17			0
‘ this body has been dancing since it was eight years old , without a stop			0
