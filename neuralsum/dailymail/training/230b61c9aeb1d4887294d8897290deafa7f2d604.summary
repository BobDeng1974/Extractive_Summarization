in a discovery that sounds uncannily like the plot of an @entity4 film , researchers have discovered that a 1,000 year old buddhist statue found by a @entity7 expedition in 1938 is made from a meteorite			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity11 , reveal the priceless statue to be a rare ataxite class of meteorite			1
the statue , known as the @entity16 , weighs 10kg and is around 24cm tall			1
the @entity18 statue first found by a @entity7 expedition in 1938			2
new analysis has found it is made from a meteorite			1
the statue is is believed to represent a stylistic hybrid between the @entity18 and @entity26 culture that portrays the god @entity27 , the @entity28 , also known as @entity29 in @entity30			1
' the statue was chiseled from a fragment of the @entity34 meteorite which crashed into the border areas between @entity36 and @entity37 about 15,000 years ago , ' said dr @entity38 from @entity39 , who made the discovery			1
' while the first debris was officially discovered in 1913 by gold prospectors , we believe that this individual meteorite fragment was collected many centuries before			2
' the team was able to classify it as an ataxite , a rare class of iron meteorite with high contents of nickel			1
the largest - ever known meteorite , the @entity54 meteorite of @entity55 , is an ataxite meteorite that may weigh more than 60 tons			2
the statue , known as the @entity16 , weighs 10kg and is believed to represent a stylistic hybrid between the @entity18 and @entity26 culture that portrays the god @entity27 , the @entity28 , also known as @entity29 in @entity30			1
it was discovered in 1938 by an expedition of @entity63 scientists led by renowned zoologist @entity64			0
the expedition was supported by @entity67 chief @entity66 and the entire expeditionary team were believed to have been @entity67 members			0
@entity64 would later claim that he accepted @entity67 support to advance his scientific research into the wildlife and anthropology of @entity30			0
however , historians believe @entity66 's support may have been based on his belief that the origins of the @entity79 race could be found in @entity30			0
the statue is believed to have been chiseled from a fragment of the @entity34 meteorite which crashed into the border areas between @entity36 and @entity37 about 15,000 years ago			1
the @entity34 meteorite field holds at least 250 meteorite fragments			2
fragments are common , and are often sold among collectors			0
it is unknown how the statue was discovered , but it is believed that the large swastika carved into the centre of the figure may have encouraged the team to take it back to @entity63			2
once it arrived in @entity96 it became part of a private collection and only became available for study following an auction in 2007			0
meteorites inspired worship from many ancient cultures ranging from the @entity104 's of @entity105 to the aborigines of @entity107			0
even today one of the most famous worship sites in the world , @entity108 in @entity109 , is based upon the @entity113 , believed to be a stony meteorite			0
dr @entity38 's team believe the @entity16 originated from the @entity26 culture of the 11th century			0
" the @entity16 statue is the only known illustration of a human figure to be carved into a meteorite , which means we have nothing to compare it to when assessing value , " said dr @entity38			1
' its origins alone may value it at $ 20,000 ; however , if our estimation of its age is correct and it is nearly a thousand years old it could be invaluable			0
