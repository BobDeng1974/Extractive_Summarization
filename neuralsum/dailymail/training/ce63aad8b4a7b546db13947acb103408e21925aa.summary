' i feel good because i know l look better than i did , ' he said thursday , before quickly adding in typical fashion , ' which is not saying much			0
' fired up : @entity2 says that now , even loyal @entity3 fans sometimes do n't recognize the new , much slimmer @entity2 on the sidelines : @entity2 , who 's been coaching the @entity3 since 2009 , is perhaps known best for his verbal outbursts @entity2 added : ' but it was n't about that for me			1
i 've been married for 25 years			0
i was n't looking for the young girlfriend or whoever			0
... i wanted to be healthier and live a long , healthy life			0
' at the height of his coaching career , he was also hitting a high on the scales , weighing in at 348 pounds just before the @entity3 faced the @entity42 in the 2009 @entity44 championship			1
he said the number left him ' mortified , ' and he even checked behind him to see if a fellow coach was playing a trick on him , putting additional pressure on the scale while he stood on it			1
couple : @entity2 has been married to his wife @entity53 since 1987			2
they have two children @entity2 said : ' there was nobody there			2
i thought i was about 300 to maybe 310			0
' he had tried all sorts of diets in the past , losing lots of weight only to gain it all back - and more			0
@entity2 decided to have @entity68 surgery after hearing the success stories of former players @entity70 and @entity72			1
the device makes him feel full after eating , say , that one taco , forcing him to practice portion control			0
@entity2 acknowledged he did n't necessarily eat much healthier - just less			1
' if i want pizza , instead of eating a whole pizza like i used to , i 'll eat a slice of pizza , if even that , ' he said			0
the device can be adjusted , so @entity2 had it loosened a bit when he and his wife recently went to @entity84 for their 25th anniversary so he could fully sample the @entity88 cuisine			2
after the surgery , his weight loss had started to plateau when he started exercising , which melted away many more pounds			2

@entity2 has gone from a 48 - to a 38 - inch waist , so he 's had to replace all his clothes except for his socks			1
his blood pressure and cholesterol have plummeted			0
without being asked , @entity2 volunteers that he 's getting paid to serve as a spokesman for @entity68			2
quarterbacks : as it has been for the last several months , the big story with the @entity3 this season is the team 's recent high - profile acquisition - @entity23 - and starter @entity109 ' my message is : do i believe in it ? there 's no question , 100 per cent , ' he said			1
so much so that he convinced his twin brother , @entity117 defensive coordinator @entity116 , to get the surgery too			0
@entity116 has lost about 60 pounds			0
@entity2 's attitude often seemed inseparable from his girth , but he insists he 's the same old @entity2 - just healthier			1
