most people do n't think twice about taking price tags off of presents before wrapping them			1
but for 19 - year - old @entity4 , doing so would be absolutely terrifying because of a rare phobia : she was frightened of stickers			1
miss @entity4 , from @entity7 , first realised she had a fear of stickers when she was seven at a sleepover			1
@entity4 , 19 , suffered a phobia of stickers which meant she was terrified of shopping because of the price labels on clothes , shoes and other goods after seeing a hypnotherapist , miss @entity4 was able to overcome her phobia and can now handle stickers			1
this year , she will finally be able to wrap and unwrap @entity22 presents since then , her discomfort developed into a full - blown phobia , which left her too scared to go shopping due to price stickers			1
it affected her work as a nursery worker because often children would bring in strips of stickers or sticker books to play with			1
eventually , she went to see a hypnotherapist , who coined the term ' pittakionophobia ' for her rare condition			1
he explained that like most phobias , pittakionophobia is an anxiety disorder rooted in a bad experience with stickers in childhood			1
miss @entity4 was delighted when after a month , her phobia was cured and this year , she is able to take the stickers off her @entity22 presents ready to wrap them for the first time ever			1
the nursery worker said : ' i knew it was ridiculous because stickers ca n't hurt you or anything , i just could n't help it			1
' it was affecting every aspect of my life and really getting me down			0
' now i do n't have to be scared to go shopping and i 'm a lot more comfortable in my work place			1
' miss @entity4 says her fear started at aged seven at a sleepover where one end of a friend 's bed was covered in stickers			1
she said : ' this girl had stickers from school all over one end of her bed on the bed stand			1
' we were meant to be top and tailing but i did n't want to sleep near the stickers - i do n't know why they just seemed weird			1
@entity75 , the therapist who treated miss @entity4 says the actual causes of pittakionophobia almost always lie in the individual 's past			1
he said : ' because of some past experience , the individual 's subconscious mind has linked the sight or thought of stickers or sticky labels with danger and anxiety			1
' most often , this has happened in childhood or in the early years of adolescence , though in some cases it may have occurred later in life			2
' such an experience may have happened directly , as a result of a traumatic experience involving a sticker - having one stuck to some part of the body , for example - or indirectly because of another person 's negative experience that was witnessed by the person who would then develop the phobia			2
' source : @entity75 ' you know what kids can be like and the more i asked the more she said no. ' in the end i asked her parents to take me home , but they could n't because they 'd had a drink			2
' i had to sleep on the floor			2
i just remember lying there thinking about the morning when i 'd finally be able to go home			0
' her fear began to get worse and affect her job : she could not even be around children at the nursery wearing stickers			1
miss @entity4 said : ' i was okay with brand new packs , sticky tape and post it notes , but nothing other than that			2
' it was especially bad if the sticker was dirty or had started peeling off			0
' it made going shopping a nightmare because i would be scared of size stickers on clothes or price stickers on shoes			1
' a phobia of stickers is so rare that only one expert has given it a name - pittakionophobia			1
@entity75 , a hypnotherapist based in @entity141 , felt so sorry for miss @entity4 he offered to cure her phobia			1
now she is finally able to take the price stickers off her @entity22 presents for the first time ever			1
miss @entity4 said : ' i think everyone would have treatment for their phobia if they could			1
' at first my family did n't believe me and would try and come near me with stickers , but once they saw my reaction they were very understanding			0
' i no longer have to worry it will affect me when i 'm out with friends who do n't know about it and i can get on with my job without feeling uncomfortable			0
' the hypnotherapist who treated miss @entity4 coined a new name for her rare phobia : pittakionophobia			1
he says there are countless people who suffer from the fear of stickers who do not know treatment is available @entity75 , who claims he is the first and only hypnotherapist in the country to treat this phobia , said : ' i was happy to play my part in freeing her from her life - long phobia			1
' very few therapists have even heard of this condition - which is why i created the term ' pittakionophobia ' , let alone know how to effectively treat it			2
' there are countless people who suffer unnecessarily from the fear of stickers and simply do not know that effective treatment is available			2
' i have successfully treated people with all kind of phobias , from fear of velvet to fear of clowns , fear of worms to fear of the wind , as well as the better know ones such as fear of spiders , heights , claustrophobia and so on			0
' i believe that every phobia can be effectively treated and the phobic person freed from a lifetime of unnecessary anxiety and fear , provided the therapist truly understands how to do this			2
' the real problem is that most of those suffering from the fear of stickers simply do not know that effective treatment is available			2
' ms @entity205 , consultant clinical psychologist with a specialty in phobias , said cognitive behavioural therapy can be succesfully be used to treat phobias such as miss @entity4 's			2
she told @entity210 : ' anything can become a phobia			2
buttons , is a common one			0
people get uncomfortable if there are buttons in a room , even if they are in a pot. ' most people have an innate phobia of snakes , but all other phobias are not rational			0
' they could have a phobia of rats , mice , spiders - or even collars on shirts			2
' we might be able to understand phobias of snakes , spiders and mice , more easily			0
we might rationalise it ’s because they carry disease			0
' but they are not rational , they are no more rational than the phobia of collars because rats do n’t have bubonic plague anymore and spiders in the @entity244 are unlikely to harm a person			0
clinical psychologist and phobia expert ms @entity205 says all phobias are irrational and normally stem from a traumatic event in childhood			0
pictured is a spider , which is a common phobia for many people ' about a third of people can remember a traumatic event which is the source of their phobia			0
but the rest do n’t have such a memory – and it could be there was no traumatic event			0
' it ’s known that phobias are made worse by avoiding them			0
if you are scared of the tube and you avoid the tube , you may develop a phobia			0
if you force yourself to travel by tube , you wo n’t			0
' the usual treatment is @entity272 ( @entity272 ) administered by a professional			0
you can be referred by your gp			0
' that ’s the only treatment that works			0
you help people change their thoughts			0
' then you might expose them to different ‘ grades ’ of whatever they are scared of , under psychological supervision			0
the person themselves sets the hierarchy , so they can cope			0
and they are taught coping mechanisms such as relaxation techniques			0
' some accredited psychologists might use hypnotherapy , but this would not normally be used in isolation , it would be used with @entity272			0
