by @entity1 reporter published : 04:51 est , 21 august 2013 @entity3 : 06:43 est , 21 august 2013 a young woman suffers with an incredibly rare disorder that causes her to sleep continuously for days and sometimes months on end			1
last year @entity7 , 23 , slept almost continuously for 59 days and behaved as if she was a small child during the episode			1
the graduate suffers from @entity10 ( @entity10 ) - dubbed @entity10 - which affects just 1,000 people in the world and can cause her to become incredibly drowsy without warning			1
@entity7 , 23 , suffers from @entity10 , that causes her to fall in to sleep - like trances , become irritable and disorientated as well as want to eat excessive amounts of food @entity7 , a fashion worker from @entity17 , @entity18 , is left in a dream - like trance or acts erratically during the few hours when her family wake her to ensure she eats , drinks and uses the bathroom			1
she relies on round the clock care and assistance from her mum @entity27 , 46 and sister @entity28 , 21			2
' it ’s had a really big impact on me and my family , ' @entity7 said			1
' in the early days of having @entity10 my mum thought i could be having a breakdown - i thought the same			1
my sister has been forced to miss university lectures and my mum has taken a lot of time off work			2
@entity10 is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence , and sometimes begins after an infection or illness			1
it is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 20 hours a day			2
episodes can come on very quickly and last between a few days to a few weeks			2
during such an episode a sufferer may be irritable , childish , disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food			1
patients return to normal between episodes , however they may become depressed as a consequence of the condition			2
1,000 people worldwide suffer from the disorder , which is commonly known as @entity10			1
70 % of sufferers are male			2
there is no known cure for the sleeping disorder , and the main treatment is watchful waiting at home by loved ones			2
research suggests episodes decrease in frequency and intensity over the course of 8 to 12 weeks			2
' the condition has become a punishment for them , as well as me			2
i do n’t know how i ’d cope without them			2
mother @entity27 , a teaching assistant , said : ' if it was just sleeping it would be so much easier			2
' when i wake her so she can use the bathroom or eat something , she ’s a different person completely			2
she ’s replaced by a toddler			0
it ’s been a stressful time			0
' @entity81 first developed the condition in 2008			0
she was 18 - years - old when she slept for 10 - days after a family party			1
the episode was dismissed as a one off and @entity7 headed off on her first holiday with friends to @entity88 later that year			1
but the drowsy symptoms of @entity10 returned and she only knew she ’d been away after waking up with a sun tan			1
@entity7 recalled : ' while i was at the airport waiting for my flight i was feeling fuzzy , but i thought it was the excitement and early start , and nothing sinister			1
' when we reached @entity88 i had this drunken feeling , even though i had n’t been drinking			0
i knew something was n’t right , but i thought i could deal it or it would pass			0
' one night i was in a club and i remember lying on the floor			0
everyone was walking past me			0
luckily , a group of teachers from my hotel found me and took me back to my friends			0
it ’s terrifying to think what could have happened			0
for most of the week long holiday , @entity7 fought off the sleep symptoms of @entity10 , but when she was back home she slept for ten days			1
vulnerable : during an episode , @entity7 , sleeps for days on end			1
she needs round the clock care to help ensure she is safe and make sure she gets enough food and water ' the holiday was a blur , ' @entity7 continued			1
' when i woke up the only reason i knew i had been away was my tan			0
' @entity7 visited her doctor but did not get an answer - one @entity126 dismissed her symptoms as simply being ‘ typical teenage behaviour ’			1
indeed it took years for @entity7 ’s @entity10 to be properly diagnosed , as there is no test for the condition and it has to be established through a process of elimination with other disorders			1
she underwent scans for a brain tumour and tests for narcolepsy at @entity140 in @entity18			1
' it was traumatic , but in a way i was almost hoping for a brain tumour , because at least then i would know what was happening and there would be doctors and surgeons who could help , ' she explained			0
' with @entity10 there is so much uncertainty			1
you ’re on your own			0
that ’s the scary thing			0
' despite her debilitating condition , @entity7 ( pictured , right , with sister @entity155 ) managed to graduate with a degree in psychology from @entity158 , @entity159 leading a normal life became difficult for @entity7 , but she was determined to complete her psychology degree at @entity158			1
@entity7 continued : ' at times i would suffer from extreme tiredness			1
i missed deadlines and had to leave classes because i was too exhausted			0
' some people assumed i was lazy or going to parties all the time			0
as time went by i started to recognise when an episode was starting			2
' it ’s like you ’re going under anaesthetic			0
you ’re floating in and out of consciousness			0
you can feel it coming on			0
during her time at university @entity7 would suffer from extreme tiredness			1
she missed deadlines and had to leave classes because she was exhausted ' one day i came out of a class at university and i just started crying			0
i could n’t remember how to get home			0
i had to call my mum for directions , as she drove to find me			0
' in 2010 , @entity7 suffered an episode that lasted a month and she missed vital exams which meant she had to re-sit her final year			1
her mum said : ' i knew how devastated she was going to be when she came round			0
she sobbed her heart out when she found out she had been sick again			0
' during an episode , life changes dramatically for @entity7 , and her mum and sister			1
as @entity10 heightens noise and light sensitivity , @entity7 sleeps with the curtains drawn , conversations are kept to whispers , the tv is virtually silent and visitors are turned away			1
@entity27 said : ' when a gp arrived to see her , she was absolutely hysterical			0
she was sobbing , completely terrified			0
she can only cope with me and her sister			0
' to make sense of life within an episode , @entity7 will follow a repetitive routine when she ’s awake			1
she watches movies on repeat and eats the same food constantly , while @entity27 and @entity155 ensure @entity7 eats properly and stays hydrated			1
' last time it was @entity211 and @entity212 , ' says @entity7			1
' it must be the only way i can make sense of what ’s happening			0
it ’s the only thing i have control over			0
in december 2012 , @entity7 graduated from @entity158 , @entity159 with a degree in @entity221			1
@entity27 added : ' she did amazingly well to get through it in the end			2
we ’re all really proud of her			0
' a month later and @entity7 was hit with an episode that lasted two months , between january and march			1
@entity7 said : ' i ¿ m a happy person in everyday life and i don ¿ t want @entity10 to overtake me			1
i ¿ m not sure about the future , but i want to stay positive ' ' for two years i had n’t suffered a significant episode , ' @entity7 said			1
' i thought it might have been over			0
' it can be depressing , because i have no control over the condition and there ’s no effective treatment or cure			0
' i ’m a happy person in everyday life and i do n’t want @entity10 to overtake me			2
i ’m not sure about the future , but i want to stay positive			0
dr @entity241 , consultant neurologist and @entity243 at @entity244 ’s and @entity240 in @entity18 , said : ' kls is a very rare neurological disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of profound sleepiness , typically lasting days or weeks			1
' the typical picture is that of a young teenager , who becomes confused , has pathological eating to excess and sometimes aggression or other personality changes during these episodes			0
' the condition can be potentially devastating , as it can ruin young people ’s social , educational and social lives			0
' the cause is unknown ; there may be a genetic or autoimmune component to it , but this is at present very speculative			0
' it remains unclear whether @entity10 is one disease or other are a number of slightly different conditions that have common features			2
' as the disease is very rare , even experts will have seen relatively small numbers of patients			2
