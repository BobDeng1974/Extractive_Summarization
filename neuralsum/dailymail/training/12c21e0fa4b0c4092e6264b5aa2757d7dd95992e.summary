the goal condemned @entity5 to a first home defeat of the season as @entity3 briefly climbed to second in the table			1
such an outcome had looked unlikely in a game of few chances between two sides more prone to drawing than winning so far this season			0
@entity0 gave @entity3 a precious away win with a strike from the edge of the box in the final seconds @entity0 ( left ) slides on his knees in celebration as his 95th - minute winner moved @entity3 up to second @entity0 celebrates after coming off the bench to net the winner on his @entity3 debut moments before scoring the winning goal @entity0 received treatment after a bang on the fae @entity5 : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 90 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 ( @entity49 76 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 86 ) , @entity53 subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 @entity3 : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 76 ) , @entity68 ( @entity69 84 ) , @entity70 , @entity71 subs not used : @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 goal : @entity69 90 +5 referee : @entity80 @entity7 threatened first in a lively start to the lunchtime encounter when @entity83 headed @entity85 's corner narrowly wide , and from @entity5 goalkeeper @entity40 's clearance , @entity51 teed up @entity87 - whose shot was well saved by @entity59			1
@entity51 's attempted curler was also kept out by @entity59 , while the lively winger then superbly turned inside @entity63 only to pull his shot wide from 15 yards			0
@entity40 , who comes from a family of @entity3 fans and was released by the club as a youngster , did well to keep out a fierce drive from @entity68 , made a bit of a meal of keeping out @entity71 's effort but then got down smartly to divert @entity70 's header wide			1
@entity101 loanee @entity47 ( right ) sees his effort saved by @entity3 goalkeeper @entity59 @entity5 full back @entity41 unleashes a shot during a goalless first half against @entity3 at @entity106 @entity48 ( left ) challenges for the ball with @entity3 's @entity64 during the @entity4 match @entity5 forward @entity53 ( near ) attempts to hold off the challenge of defender @entity83 at the other end @entity59 was also kept on his toes and made a fine diving stop to deny the overlapping @entity5 right - back @entity41 before half - time			1
with both sets of strikers misfiring , @entity3 left - back @entity63 also tried to take matters into his own hands just after the interval , striding forward and skipping past two tackles on the edge of the area before taking aim and firing inches wide			0
a curler from @entity71 failed to trouble @entity59 as it flew the wrong side of the post , and substitute @entity67 was denied by a superb last - ditch challenge from @entity43			0
things might have been different had @entity5 's best chance of the match fallen to their top scorer , @entity53			2
instead the @entity139 striker created it , cutting the ball back from the byline to @entity51 10 yards out , only to see his team - mate take a swing and a miss in front of goal			0
and the hosts were made to pay at the end when @entity70 's half - cleared cross fell to @entity0 , who lashed it through a crowd of players and into the net .			2
