by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 08:28 est , 6 december 2012 beneath an exclusive area of @entity3 , behind the white stucco facade of one of the @entity8 ’s most expensive properties , i am 50ft underground			1
@entity9 , i pad across the leather , under - heated floor of a private gym towards a shimmering turquoise pool			1
the walls of this subterranean oasis are illuminated with video images of windswept beaches on wall - size screens			1
tycoon @entity20 's secret : a modest schoolhouse conceals a lavish mansion underground exterior : @entity20 's @entity25 home there is a treatment room with fluffy towels , scented candles and a massage bed , and a dark , tiled steam room			1
the soft lighting and air conditioning are controlled by a computer			2
being one level below the original basement , the whole floor is completely without natural light or fresh air			1
as a claustrophobic , i was expecting it to be about as inviting as @entity44 ’s @entity43 bunker			2
but a combination of clever interior design , expert building and state - of - the - art technology means that it is blissful and cocoon - like			1
no wonder these new layers of @entity3 housing have become so fashionable			2
but acquiring this underworld paradise , and one of the largest indoor swimming pools in @entity57 , is never going to come cheap : this five - bedroom house in @entity53 is for sale with estate agents @entity59 at just under £ 16 million			1
this is a classic bankers ’ bunker : an underground retreat with its own spa and pool			1
in a city where the smartest neighbourhoods have limitless cash , but are governed by strict planning laws , building up or sideways is rarely allowed			1
going underground : @entity70 , left , and @entity71 both want to extend the basement of their homes so digging down is the ever - more popular answer			1
these new extensions are known as ‘ icebergs ’ because while you may only see the house above ground level , there is much more : multiple secret storeys hidden below			2
@entity83 & @entity85 planning department now do little else but assess residents ’ downwardly mobile ambitions			1
they have received well over 800 applications for fancy basements in the past four years			1
the vast majority have been accepted			2
the pretty @entity92 streets and squares are marked less by trees now than by angled conveyor belts transferring dug - out rubble and soil into skips to be carted away in trucks			1
it ’s a complicated business — building works must be assiduously sealed to avoid flooding			2
despite these technical considerations , some @entity3 streets in smart parts of town seem to have about three underground pools being built at any one time			1
residents ’ time is taken up either investigating their own subterranean potential or complaining about other people ’s efforts			2
not everyone sees the need for private spas in the middle of town			2
take the recently released plans of @entity121 cable tv tycoon @entity20 , a ‘ socialite @entity125 type ’ ( according to his acquaintances ) , who was once married to @entity123 ’s wife @entity122			2
he wants to build an ‘ iceberg ’ basement four storeys deep beneath a 19th - century schoolhouse in @entity25			1
his underground extension will house a pool , a ballroom , a car lift and parking spaces , and will expand his house into a giant with most of it lurking beneath the surface			2
neighbours , including novelist @entity142 and the @entity143 of @entity144 , are furious			0
no one needs that much space , ’ said the @entity143			0
‘ the commotion is going to be dreadful			0
’ a spokesman for @entity151 added : ‘ why should we all suffer just so one man can indulge his fantasy ? ’ digging out and shifting tons of earth around can , indeed , be pretty disruptive			0
the anger of neighbours is usually inflamed by the fact that the homeowner is often living elsewhere while the works are carried out , and so is immune to the stress and noise			0
angry : @entity165 , novelist and short story writer , is said to be opposed to @entity20 's plans to extend his home @entity170 director @entity169 had to apologise to his furious neighbours in @entity83 this summer after his £ 1 million basement excavation — built to fit a playroom , guest room , gym , wine cellar and cinema into his £ 7 million house — turned into a @entity180 farce			1
slight shifts in the foundations saw neighbours left stuck in their flats by doors that would n’t open , while cracks appeared like a hatching egg			0
@entity189 , who lives in the flat next door , said : ‘ they ’ve been digging since the beginning of the year , down into the basement , and it ’s caused the house to subside			2
the basement flat in my block has got cracks everywhere			2
’ even @entity169 ’s own house wobbled , and required emergency surgery			0
neighbour @entity201 said wearily : ‘ once planning permission is granted there are only the fine words and empty promises of architects , surveyors and party - wall agreements to protect neighbours			1
’ in 2009 , @entity210 , the wily founder of @entity211 who sold his company for £ 370 million just before the financial crash , put in an application for a whopping five - level basement that included a swimming pool , a full - sized underground tennis court and a car museum for his @entity219 , vintage cars and motorbikes ‘ to be displayed like objects of art ’			1
steel tycoon @entity224 , meanwhile , has a jewelled swimming pool and warren of steam rooms made from the same marble as the @entity229 in the basement of his house ( known , of course , as the @entity234 ) in @entity83			1
swish : @entity236 @entity224 , chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the world 's largest steel company , @entity239 , has a jewelled swimming pool and a warren of steam rooms in the basement of his home @entity245 heiress @entity71 added 5,000 sq ft to the 17,000 sq ft @entity83 house she recently bought for £ 45 million			1
her basement extension included a bowling alley , swimming pool , disco and a ‘ 3d movie theatre with eight custom - designed seats each with its own refrigerator and popcorn maker ’ , according to her @entity257 - based designer			1
she did however , in an uncharacteristic display of self - restraint , scrap the plans for a ‘ dog spa ’			2
@entity71 ’s younger sister @entity70 , not to be outdone , is doing her own basement in @entity85			1
her underground extension will have all the usual ‘ toys ’ and , apparently , a waterfall			2
@entity267 , a philanthropist who lives nearby , led furious residents who wrote to her father @entity269 asking for compensation for the disruption			0
‘ we suggested that he give us some money rather than throwing it all away on his spoiled daughter so she can live in this enormous monster of a house , ’ she said tartly			0
meanwhile , elsewhere in @entity83 , @entity278 of boy band @entity280 is engaged in the ongoing excavation of his £ 4.4 million @entity83 house to build ‘ nanny quarters ’ and a playroom			1
one neighbour said : ‘ we predicted this would cause a lot of trouble and we were right			0
we ’ve been condemned to months of noise and inconvenience			0
normal family life is being ruined by this fashion for excavations			0
’ extending : @entity280 's @entity278 is excavating his @entity83 home to build a ' nanny quarters ' and a playroom such ‘ iceberg ’ extensions have become so desirable that even houses where no extra space is needed are having their foundations excavated			1
take @entity303 in @entity304 , @entity3			0
this enormous pile is to be doubled in size — even though there is already 45,000 sq ft of it			0
plans of the proposed extension show two home cinemas , a spa with a hair salon and massage room , a 70ft swimming pool , and a car park for 25 cars			0
the entire enterprise is thought to be costing more than £ 50 million			0
when completed , it will be the largest home in @entity3 not owned by the @entity320			0
@entity322 property prices have risen 43 per cent in the past three years , leading many homeowners to look at ways of improving their existing properties before considering a move			1
but while increasing your square footage may increase the value of your property , you need very deep pockets for a deep dig. and what do you need all that underground space for ? @entity335 , of @entity336 , which acts for top - end buyers , sounds a note of caution			1
‘ a bedroom legally has to have a window — not unreasonably — so you quickly run out of things to do with sub-basements			0
‘ icebergs just do n’t feel right			0
i ’ve seen — with a heavy heart — golf simulation rooms , a pilates studio , a cinema , and a massive pool with a retractable roof that turned into a dancefloor			0
but the further you go down , the further you are from proper ventilation and daylight			0
’ the rich used to build towers and follies as trophies of their wealth , although there has always been the odd rich eccentric who fancied life underground			1
in the mid- 19th century , the fifth @entity363 , a strange , shy agrophobic , built a web of tunnels 15 miles long , and a huge pink ballroom underneath his estate at @entity370 in @entity371			0
not surprisingly for such a withdrawn character , he never held a ball there			0
at @entity376 in @entity377 , a mining magnate called @entity379 built a billiards room with a glass ceiling under the lake			0
this display of wealth did n’t do him any good in the long run			0
his empire collapsed and he committed suicide			0
in 1903 , the estate was bought by @entity391 , the shipbuilder who went on to build the @entity394			0
you really ca n’t trust them .			0

the rich and famous are downwardly mobile - with an increasing trend to extend homes underground through the basement rather than *overground*
