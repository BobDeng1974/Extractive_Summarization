by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 20:20 est , 28 february 2013 a liberal democrat lord mayor has kept his job despite making a lewd remark to a schoolgirl			0
@entity5 , 62 , was accused of telling the child , ‘ it ’s sexy when you bend down like that ’ while on official duty at an awards evening			1
it happened while the youngster and other members of an under - 13s sport team were having their photograph taken with him			0
the married father - of - three , who is a city and county councillor , claims he may have said ‘ best if you stand next to me ’ and was misheard			2
@entity22 lord mayor @entity5 allegedly made the comment to a member of a under - 13s sports team at a awards evening			1
he is pictured with @entity28 democracy campaigner @entity27 last june but a council investigation found it was ‘ highly probable ’ mr @entity5 , lord mayor of @entity22 , did make an ‘ inappropriate and disrespectful ’ comment			1
at a hearing held in secret to protect the girl ’s identity , they ruled he had brought the office of lord mayor and the city council into disrepute			2
but apart from being ‘ censured ’ – effectively , given a telling off – the council has taken no disciplinary action and he has been allowed to remain lord mayor			2
yesterday mr @entity5 said : ‘ i regret the whole thing very much , but there is no single version of what was said that was endorsed by all the witnesses			1
‘ i am absolutely sure i did not say ‘ ‘ bending ’ ’ because in the context it is an inappropriate word to use			2
‘ i think it is very unlikely that i said the word ‘ ‘ sexy ’ ’ , and that is what i have said all along , but in any case , i do not believe it [ the word ] has any sexual connotation			1
‘ i think it is very unlikely that i would have used the word ‘ ‘ sexy ’ ’ to a 13 - year - old girl , but i can not remember exactly how the repartee went			1
it was a confused , rowdy event , with a lot of people wanting a photo			0
‘ i may have said something like ‘ ‘ best if you stand next to me ’ ’ and that could have been misheard as containing the words ‘ ‘ bending ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ sexy ’ ’			1
however , i do n’t believe the girls lied			0
’ rap : @entity71 's @entity70 called the alleged comment ' highly inappropriate ' the investigation began after a parent complained to the girl ’s school about the incident in june last year , a month after mr @entity5 began his year in office as lord mayor			1
the school passed it to @entity82 ’s child protection team , which found mr @entity5 was not a risk to youngsters			2
but it did pass its findings to @entity71 to see if its code of conduct had been breached			0
there were differing accounts of what mr @entity5 was alleged to have said			0
they included : ‘ it ’s sexy when you bend down like that ’ ; ‘ bending is very sexy , is n’t it ? ’ ; and ‘ ooh , that ’s a bit sexy ’			1
it is understood the girl and up to five witnesses gave evidence about the alleged offending comment			0
mr @entity5 denied the allegation			0
his wife @entity104 , a professor of clinical trials and honorary consultant in public health medicine at the @entity108 , has stood by him			0
the council ’s standards committee met on wednesday and found he should be censured for breaking the council ’s code of conduct			0
but they also decided ‘ there was no reason why councillor @entity5 should not continue to undertake the full range of his mayoral duties and noted that he had given an indication that he would do so ’ , council documents say			1
while he has held on to the office of lord mayor , mr @entity5 now faces a grilling and disciplinary action from his party			0
a @entity124 spokesman said : ‘ such behaviour is absolutely unacceptable			2
’ mr @entity5 , who lists his hobbies on a council website as music , history and his allotment , said the investigation had been ‘ like a pall ’ over his time as lord mayor , during which his duties have included presenting @entity28 democracy campaigner @entity27 with the freedom of the city of @entity22			1
a spokesman for @entity138 said they were not involved in the case .			0

@entity124 @entity5 allegedly told the youngster : ' it ’s sexy when you bend down like that '
@entity70 ruled it ‘ highly probable ’ that he made comment
