we hear between 10 and 200 lies every day , from ‘ sorry , my phone ’s died , ’ to ‘ i ’m fine ’			0
and just by listening to simple linguistic clues , we could easily weed them out , claims scientist and linguistics expert			2
minimal self - references , negative language , simple explanations and convoluted phrasing are all hallmarks of a lie			1
people can spot liars because they use more convoluted language but refer to themselves less in a made - up story , according to the research in a @entity30 , @entity24 a science communicator and chief executive of @entity27 based in @entity28 , @entity29 , explained how ‘ linguistic text analysis ’ - which is based on the difference between how we structure the truth , and lies – can help people spot untruths			1
studies have shown that stories based on imagined experiences are qualitatively different from those based on real experiences , suggesting that coming up with a lie takes work and results in a different pattern of language use			2
linguistic text analysis helps people spot four common patterns in the subconscious language of lying			1
@entity24 , a science communicator , explained that liars tend to refer to themselves less in a story			1
when @entity55 ( pictured ) denied using performance - enhancing drugs , he used a hypothetical scenario to distance himself from his lie , while when he later admitted to using them , he used 75 per cent more pronouns liars tend to refer to themselves less in a story that is n't true , and sometimes use hypothetical situations or mention others more than usual			1
they often use negative terms , because they are subconsciously feeling guilty			0
untrue stories tend to be overly - simplified because humans find it hard to construct and keep track of complex lies			0
while their story may be simple , liars tend to use longer , convoluted sentences , adding in irrelevant but factual - sounding details in a bid to make a story sound more convincing			2
mr @entity78 explained that liars typically mention themselves less and talk more about others in a lie			0
they sometimes use the third person to disassociate themselves from their lie , because they feel subconsciously guilty			0
‘ liars tend to be more negative because on a subconscious level they feel guilty about lying			0
' for example , a liar might say : “ sorry , my stupid phone battery died			0
i hate that thing , ” mr @entity78 said			0
people can also spot a lie when someone explains events in very simple terms			1
our brains struggle to build a complex false story , which means that explanations about events that did n’t happen , seem unrealistically straightforward			0
but while liars may keep their story simple , they tend to use longer and more convoluted sentences , inserting irrelevant but factual sounding details to pad out the lie , he said			2
people can spot a lie when someone explains events in very simple terms ( illustrated left )			2
our brains struggle to build a complex false story , which means that explanations about events that did n’t happen , seem unrealistically straightforward , compared to a real - life story ( illustrated lightheartedly right ) mr @entity78 said that the devices can be seen in famous lies			1
for example , when seven times winner of the @entity116 , @entity55 denied using performance - enhancing drugs in 2005 , he described a hypothetical situation focused on someone else , to distance himself from his lie			1
conversely , when he admitted to using them in 2013 , his use of personal pronouns increased by nearly three quarters , indicating that he was telling the truth			1
he talked about his focus on personal emotions and motivations .			0

minimal self - references and convoluted phrases are hallmarks of a lie
simple explanations and negative language are also *giveaways*
a technique called linguistic text analysis allows people to spot them
science communicator applies technique to famous lies in a video
he showed that @entity55 *avoided* mentioning himself when he denied using performance - enhancing drugs in a 2005 *interview*
*cyclist* increased use of personal pronouns by 75 *%* when admitting crime
