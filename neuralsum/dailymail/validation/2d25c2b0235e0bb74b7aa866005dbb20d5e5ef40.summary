@entity1 's controversial debutant @entity0 saved his adopted country from a major embarrassment with a fantastic late strike to lift spirits ahead of their friendly against @entity8 on tuesday			1
criticism aimed at @entity1 coach @entity10 for picking the @entity11 - born @entity0 – named by his football - loving parents after the 1982 @entity15 @entity14 star of the same name – was forgotten as the @entity18 striker produced a brilliant finish after 84 minutes to preserve @entity1 's unbeaten record in @entity21 qualifying @entity22 @entity1 striker @entity0 ( left ) celebrates scoring late equaliser with coach @entity10 @entity0 's late strike extended @entity1 's unbeaten run in @entity29 qualifying to 45 matches @entity31 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ( @entity40 88 ) , @entity41 ( @entity42 85 ) , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 73 )			1

@entity0 , to give him his full title , turned brilliantly on the edge of the penalty area and hammered a right - foot curler that gave goalkeeper @entity87 no chance			1
ex-manchester city manager @entity89 , now in charge of @entity92 , was among those who opposed his selection and said the @entity1 should only pick @entity96 - born players			1
@entity0 did n't move to @entity1 until he was 16			1
his late equaliser saved @entity1 from a major humiliation in rain - soaked @entity99			1
despite being gifted an early lead with an own goal , @entity10 's team then capitulated to trail 2 - 1 after 17 minutes against opponents who had only managed to beat @entity104 in their other four group games			1
even so , the @entity96 manager now faces an uncertain reception in @entity108 against @entity109 's @entity8 with @entity111 fans also blaming him for a knee injury to midfielder @entity113 sustained in @entity1 training on friday			2
@entity116 president @entity115 claimed on saturday that death threats issued over the internet against @entity10 had left the manager “ shaken ” and angry			0
@entity10 left @entity111 to replace @entity119 after last summer 's @entity14 and he rounded on his critics after saturday night 's draw by saying : ' i am @entity123 – but i do n't forget			2
you can draw your own conclusions			0
@entity41 equalised for @entity31 with an 11th - minute strike on saturday night @entity127 midfielder @entity41 celebrates his goal against @entity1 in @entity99 @entity69 of @entity1 challenges @entity35 and goalkeeper @entity87 ' in terms of the performance and the chances created , we deserved the victory			1
it ’s a shame , as we achieved the bare minimum with the utmost effort in an arena that is traditionally difficult			0
' i liked the lads , we dominated the game and they were restricted purely to counter-attacks			0
' @entity31 are a far cry from @entity144 's side that reached the @entity14 semi-finals in 1994			2
and the match seemed to be going according to the formbook after four minutes when goalkeeper @entity87 pushed a cross into the path of defender @entity36 who could n't help it crossing the line for an own goal			2
without legendary goalkeeper @entity156 who was taken ill with flu shortly before the match , @entity1 's traditionally - strong rearguard was left all at sea			1
@entity1 struck early when goalkeeper @entity87 pushed a cross into the path of defender @entity36 @entity31 hit back when @entity39 's pinpoint cross to the far post was headed home by @entity164 @entity31 's @entity41 , right , and @entity1 's @entity59 battle for control in torrential rain @entity31 's @entity41 , 2nd left , takes free - kick at the @entity171 stadium in @entity99 @entity173 @entity172 did n't look a bad replacement but he had no chance with @entity31 's equaliser after 11 minutes when @entity41 took advantage of a back - pedalling defence to arrow in a low shot from 18 yards			1
incredibly , @entity31 then quickly went ahead			2
@entity96 striker @entity68 carelessly lost the ball by the halfway line going for a mazy dribble and the home side counter-attacked at speed			0
@entity39 's pinpoint cross to the far post was aimed for @entity164 and he got ahead of sluggish defender @entity58 to expertly headed in beyond @entity57			2
it was beyond the dreams of the @entity191 fans , most of whom were getting thoroughly soaked by a torrential downpour			0
in fact , the @entity193 was only half - full because of low expectation among home fans but those who turned up were rewarded			0
@entity10 sent on @entity0 for @entity68 as a desperate measure to salvage a point – and it worked			0
@entity1 , second in their group , are now firm favourites to qualify for @entity21 alongside leaders @entity205 who they face in @entity207 in june			0
@entity10 will definitely be without @entity113 for @entity8 's visit even though initial reports the midfielder suffered ligament damage look unfounded with medical tests showing nothing more serious than a sprain while @entity156 will do his best to return from his illness			0
the only @entity217 player on show , @entity219 striker @entity77 , was an unused substitute for @entity1 but could face @entity8 and his @entity219 team - mate @entity220 this week .			2

@entity1 had *grabbed* the lead in the fourth minute when the @entity191 left back @entity36 put the ball into his own net
@entity31 levelled thanks to @entity41 's *thunderous* 20 - metre drive that ended his 17 - month international goal *drought*
@entity164 made it 2 - 1 for @entity31 but ebutant @entity0 scored a fantastic late equaliser in @entity99
