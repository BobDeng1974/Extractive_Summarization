desirable : @entity26 lies within @entity158 's @entity157 constituency and is a sought - after place to live lying within the @entity160 of villages favoured by celebrities and entrepreneurs , @entity123 is surrounded by rolling countryside but also just 15 miles from @entity165 and five miles from its airport			1
with 13,000 inhabitants , the leafy town is staunchly conservative , barring a blip from 1997 to 2001 when independent former television journalist @entity170 stole the seat of @entity48 from @entity35 @entity172 , in disgrace over the cash for questions row			0
