by @entity0 the @entity2 telescope might be almost 24 years old , but astronomers are still finding ways to improve its capabilities			1
their latest innovation has seen them find a way to measure the distances to stars up to 10,000 light - years away			1
that ’s ten times farther than was previously possible with the telescope			0
astronomers applied a technique known as spatial scanning to increase @entity2 's ability to gauge distances ten-fold			1
the method uses something known as parallax , a form of trigonometry , to measure distances ‘ this new capability is expected to yield new insight into the nature of dark energy , a mysterious component of space that is pushing the universe apart at an ever - faster rate , ' said @entity33 laureate @entity32 of the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) in @entity35 , @entity36			1
@entity32 and the @entity37 in @entity35 , in collaboration with @entity39 of @entity34 , developed the technique to extend @entity2 ’s sight			0
this upgraded capability is made possible using something known as parallax			0
this is a trigonometric technique that can be used to make reliable measures of astronomical distances			0
to understand how it works , imagine @entity50 ’s orbit and a distant star form a triangle			0
@entity50 ’s orbit forms the base of the triangle , with two imaginary lines running to the star and making the ‘ point ’ of the triangle			0
the length of these lines , and thus the distance to the star , can be calculated by measuring the three ‘ angles ’ of the imaginary triangle			2
this method works well for stars that are relatively close to us , those a few hundred light - years away , but for stars further away it is harder as the angles become smaller and more difficult to measure			1
the @entity2 was launched on 24 april 1990 , but a @entity72 repair mission was required soon after launch to get it fully functional after a fault in one of the mirrors was discovered to extend the yardstick , astronomers have found a way to measure smaller angles more accurately using @entity2 , down to five - billionths of a degree			1
they tested this by getting @entity2 to measure the distance to a @entity86 variable , which is a class of bright star often referred to as a ‘ standard candle ’ of the universe for distance measurements			2
@entity86 variables are stars that vary between large , bright states and small , dense ones			0
their importance was recognised by female astronomer @entity96 in 1908 , who realised that the relationship of a @entity86 variable ’s changing state and its luminosity could be used to place ‘ distance markers ’ across the universe			0
using this principle , @entity2 correctly confirmed the star in question in the constellation @entity108 was 7,500 light - years away			1
it did this by taking two exposures of the target star six months apart , when our planet was on opposite sides of the sun. a very small shift in the star ’s position was then measured to an accuracy of 1/1,000th of a single image pixel in @entity2 ’s @entity121 , which has 16.8 megapixels ( 16.8 million pixels ) in total			2
a third exposure was then taken six months later to remove errors			0
this then gave the correct distant measurement , which the astronomers knew previously			0
the telescope was so accurate , in fact , that the astronomers are now planning to use @entity2 to refine the ‘ cosmic distance ladder , ' a ‘ rung ’ of measurements for the universe that uses various @entity86 variables as distance markers			1
although @entity2 might be pushing a quarter of a century in age , this latest innovation proves just how useful the telescope is in our continuing studies of the cosmos			2
the @entity2 was carried into orbit by a @entity72 in 1990 @entity2 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared its orbit outside the distortion of @entity50 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high - resolution images with almost no background light @entity2 's @entity152 has recorded some of the most detailed visible - light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time the telescope is one of @entity160 's @entity159 , along with the @entity161 , the @entity162 and the @entity163 @entity2 is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts its scientific successor , the @entity167 is currently scheduled to be launched by @entity160 in 2018			1

astronomers have used trigonometry to increase the range of @entity2
using what is called parallax they can measure distances to stars
the method was previously *limited* to just a few hundred light - years
but now with @entity2 they can measure angles to five - billionths of a degree
this enabled them to measure the distance to a star 7,500 light - years away
@entity2 could now be employed to refine the ' cosmic distance ladder '
the telescope was launched on 24 april 1990 and turns 24 this year
