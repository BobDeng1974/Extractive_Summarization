by @entity0 published : 05:41 est , 11 june 2013 updated : 10:14 est , 11 june 2013 it was recovered yesterday after 70 years lying on the bottom of the @entity3 , but the @entity5 @entity4 rescued from its watery grave was originally shot down at the height of the @entity9			1
the aircraft , which historians believe is the only remaining example of the ' flying pencil ' , was raised from the sea bed in the biggest salvage operation of its kind in @entity18 waters			2
but the bomber was originally part of a large enemy formation which was intercepted by @entity23 fighter aircraft on august 26 , 1940 , as they attempted to attack airfields in @entity26			1
attempting a wheels - up landing , @entity48 ( flt sgt ) @entity47 managed to touch down safely and the aircraft sank inverted			1
while @entity47 and his observer were captured the other crewmen died and their bodies were later washed ashore			0
a notable aspect of the battle was the enormous bravery of the @entity23 @entity58 fighter pilots , who took on the @entity4 17 in outdated planes which had already suffered many losses in the early stages of the @entity9			1
the two - seater planes , which had space for a rear gunner , were considered obsolete by the time the @entity9 was in full swing and the type was eventually withdrawn from front - line fighter duties to be converted to a night fighter role and later a drone tug			1
the @entity4 was one of the principal bombers used by the @entity72 in the early years of the war , including during the @entity74			0
it was part of a combined formation of dorniers sent to bomb @entity79 and @entity80 airfields before the battle in august 1940			0
rising leviathan : the @entity4 aircraft is lifted from waters of the @entity3			1
it was shot down during the ' @entity9 ' in 1940 by @entity87 fighters			1
two of its four - man @entity72 crew were killed as it crashed into the sea , but the other two were captured by the @entity18 and became prisoners of war @entity94 : the team watches as the aircraft is painstakingly lifted out of the sea			2
aviation enthusiasts are excited because the bomber is in ' remarkable condition ' success : earlier attempts to raise the craft from the sea bed were thwarted by high winds but the project finally came to fruition today			1
some parts of the aircraft fell into the seas as it was being raised , but the @entity111 tweeted that these parts will be recovered by divers			2
the wings and engines are intact , amazingly recovery : workers secure the remains of the crashed @entity4 , the only surviving one of its type			1
it is known as the ' pencil bomber ' because of its extremely thin fuselage the @entity4 is believed to have been brought down by an @entity23 @entity58 ( pictured ) it is believed seven aircraft started to bomb an aerodrome , thought to be @entity79 , causing some damage			2
however , accounts of the aircraft 's loss vary between sources			0
since the recovery yesterday , the wings and the fuselage of the aircraft have been sympathetically detached as the aircraft lies on the barge which is waiting to come into @entity138 today			1
once the plane lands in the harbour it will be wrapped in a ' gel - like ' substance to prevent further oxidisation and will then be placed upon three wide - load lorries to be taken up to @entity145 this afternoon			2
@entity147 , head of marketing at the @entity111 , said once at @entity145 , the aircraft will be placed into hydration tunnels and it will be sprayed with a light citric solution to gently wash the aircraft of the salts that have accumulated over the last 70 years			1
he said : ' during this process , the aircraft will be on view to the public and that should happen this weekend			0
' it will undergo this process for three to five years at @entity145 after which we will probably spend another year to a year - and - a - half prepping the aircraft to ensure it does n't suffer any further corrosion and the intention is that it will eventually go on display at our @entity111 site opposite the wrecked @entity169 that we have here that was recovered from the @entity9			1
' according to the original @entity172 , the @entity4 became separated from the rest of the formation while flying above clouds before reaching its target			0
it was then attacked by fighters , believed to be one of the recently arrived @entity181 , @entity26 - based @entity180 of @entity23 led by @entity182			2
the attack is thought to have hit both engines and the cockpit			0
reports suggest the @entity187 brought down between one and six @entity189 in the fight , while losing three of their number			0
of the four crew of the @entity4 , two became @entity194 in @entity196 - wounded pilot @entity195 and @entity197 - and two were killed - 27 - year old @entity199 and 21 - year old bomb aimer @entity200			0
their bodies were recovered later and buried in @entity203 and the @entity18 , in the @entity205 @entity5 cemetery , respectively			1
the recovery of the aircraft from the seabed is a £ 600,000 project by the @entity111 in @entity210			0
its team were able to raise the aircraft by placing metal cables around the strongest part of the frame and lifting it whole			0
experts at the museum say the plane , found on @entity33 by divers in 2008 , is in ' remarkable condition ' , particularly considering the events surrounding its downfall and the effects of spending so much time under water			1
@entity228 , of the @entity111 , said : ‘ the discovery and recovery of the @entity4 is of national and international importance			0
the aircraft is a unique and unprecedented survivor from the @entity234			0
. ' it will provide an evocative and moving exhibit that will allow the museum to present the wider story of the @entity9 and highlight the sacrifices made by the young men of both air forces			2
it is a project that has reconciliation and remembrance at its heart			0
' apart from being covered with barnacles and teeming with marine life , the @entity4 is largely intact			0
the undercarriage tyres remain inflated although the propellers were damaged when the aircraft crashed			2
sonar scans by the @entity111 , @entity252 and the @entity253 confirmed its identity			0
the recovery was backed by a @entity257 grant of £ 345,000			0
a two - year restoration will take place at the @entity111 ’s site in @entity145 , @entity261 , and it will later go on display at the @entity111 in @entity263 , @entity210			0
the plane will eventually be restored and go on display as an ' evocative and moving ' reminder of the young men of both sides who lost their lives in the battle for air supremacy in 1940			2
in the air once more : despite the nearly 73 years it has lain on the sea floor , the @entity5 bomber is in remarkable condition , with the wings and engine still attached rise : a salvage worker stands next to one of the @entity72 bomber 's water - damaged engines underwater images of the @entity286 lying in 50ft of water off the @entity34 coast			1
it is the only surviving @entity291 @entity290 bomber to be raised from its watery grave in the @entity3 under the sea : the @entity4 bomber lay off the coast of @entity34 and is remarkably well - preserved			1
even the tyre pressure of the landing wheels is believed to be intact			1

@entity5 bomber was recovered yesterday after spending 70 years at the bottom of the @entity3
the plane was shot down by @entity87 fighters at the height of the @entity9 in 1940
was forced to make an emergency ' wheels - up ' landing on the @entity33 after its engines were damaged
aircraft is in ' remarkable condition ' and the wings and engines are intact
