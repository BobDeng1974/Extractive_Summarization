fashion and politics often crossover			0
fashion weeks are met with anti-fur protesters and there are constant debates about the working conditions of people employed by clothing manufacturers			0
so it should come as no surprise to see sensitive subjects make an appearance at @entity0			0
day three of the event saw several designers pushing boundaries with their creative choices			1
however , one particular dress caught the spectators attention			0
in his finale , the piece was completed with an illustration of a woman in a full @entity23 slinking up the side split of the slender model			1
other pieces in the collection featured silk jumpsuits and matching hats printed with army camouflage			0
the collection certainly displayed certain parallels with the current world conflicts but @entity18 insists that this was not his inspiration and said it actually reflected the relationship between @entity51 and @entity52			0
this is not the first time that the @entity56 designer has caused controversy with his use of traditional dress in his clothing lines			0
in his most famous collection which he presented 16 years ago , displayed models all wearing a traditional burka in a line			2
however , each model became more and more naked until one was completely nude as they got further along the line			0
@entity18 says that his collection takes inspiration from the relationship between @entity51 and @entity52 the designer insists unusual decoration has no reflection on the @entity73 conflict the @entity56 designer presented colourful goggles alongside army print silks on the very same day that @entity18 presented his @entity20 range another designer linked their line back to one of the world 's most well - known political issues , with @entity85 president @entity84 taking centre stage at the @entity87			1
the much opposed leader appeared across the t - shirts of the models in the form of tourist posters with slogans such as ' visit @entity94			1
. before he does ! ' the design took inspiration from t - shirts that were sold at @entity100 's @entity99 department stores printed with images of @entity84 in a @entity103 shirt , cocktail in hand , with the headline stating : ' greetings from @entity108 '			1
@entity110 design duo @entity87 used @entity84 as the print for their sports luxe t - shirts @entity87 printed images of the @entity85 leader on tourist style poster accompanied with the words ' visit @entity94 / @entity120 / @entity119 ... before he does ' the @entity123 design duo are open in saying that they hope that their controversial tops will help make a statement			1
they told @entity129 : ' we thought the fact that some people buy those and are wearing them with pride was an interesting fashion statement , ' @entity127 said , ' and we thought we use our cute little sporty collection as a form of protest			2
' @entity127 and @entity140 have previously used their collections as an opportunity to make a political statement			0
last season they aimed to make a stand for gay rights when they used an image of a young man holding up a ' corduroy skirts are a sin ' sign , as he stood next to an anti-gay activist in that very item of clothing as the inspiration for the collection			0
@entity20 selection of models seemed abnormally slim in comparison to other catwalks over sized handbags and baggy blouses accentuate the women 's small frames in another bold move at day three of the @entity120 ' most stylish event a fashion hot - topic reared its familiar head			1
the issue of using super skinny models has been one that has plagued the fashion industry for years			2
it is widely agreed that the use of them can cause young girls to develop eating disorders and after furious campaigning the fashion industry has seen far less of them			0
as it currently stands models with a body mass index of 18 or under were banned from @entity185 and in 2012 , @entity182 made a pact to protect the health of models by banning all fashion models younger than 16 or ‘ who appear to have an eating disorder ’ from their pages			2
however , the models who appeared on the runway of @entity197 seemed to be of a smaller stature of those we have seen on the runway in recent years			1
billowing silk blouses and over sized earrings accentuated the models ' petite frames and stick - thin arms			1
@entity197 are n't the first designers to feature ultra-skinny women on their runway 's with @entity210 coming under fire at @entity212 for the use of of their tiny models			1
day three of @entity120 fashion week saw more than its fair share of risky fashion , and whether it will be met with applause or criticism it is sure to keep everyone talking .			2

the third day of @entity224 took a more serious turn
images of president @entity84 appeared on t - shirts as a protest
revealing dressed were decorated with illustrations of the @entity23
ultra-skinny models took to the catwalk at @entity197
