was this golf ’s biggest - ever collapse ? @entity2 , was this the most shocking capitulation in the long history of sport ? ‘ expect the unexpected ’ read the banners advertising the @entity8 @entity7 but no - one expected anything quite so unexpected as what happened on a truly dramatic afternoon in the desert			1
the facts are @entity14 birdied three of his first four holes to move 10 shots clear in pursuit of his fourth victory in this event			1
at that point , @entity20 rated him 500 - 1 on to do what he did at the @entity23 last june and march relentlessly to victory			2
unknown @entity26 @entity25 , ranked 357 in the world , has won the @entity8 @entity7 @entity25 , who shot 65 , looked like a man in shock as he was awarded the handsome trophy to put that into perspective , @entity31 were merely 100 - 1 on when they went 3 - 0 up against @entity34 at half - time in the @entity37 final			1
this was a racing certainly to rank alongside @entity40 in that @entity41 all those years ago			2
and yet @entity14 , with the winning post in sight , collapsed every bit as dramatically as the @entity46 ’s horse			1
this being golf , though , the agony went on for more than two hours			2
‘ i am very surprised by what happened and a little shocked , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ i certainly did n’t think that would happen			0
’ he was n’t the only one			0
the beneficiary was 22 - year - old @entity26 @entity25 , ranked 357th in the world , who shot 65 and kept his nerve over the closing holes while @entity14 was losing his			1
he was emotional at the finish , and not just because this was his first win on tour			2
@entity25 was on the golf course last may at the @entity63 when he learned his mother @entity64 had died from cancer			1
@entity14 had seemed certain to win and had a 10 - shot lead at one stage on the final day but @entity14 suffered a monumental collapse and did n't even finish second in the end after falling eight shots behind @entity14 on saturday , @entity70 said he was playing for second place , and duly achieved his fourth runner - up finish in this event with a final - round 66			1
not in a million years , though , did he think he would be finishing second to @entity75			0
@entity14 won both the @entity76 and the @entity77 last year when leading from start to finish , and did the same when achieving his first win in this event in 2008			1
all that , however , proved no preparation once his swing began to unhinge following a double bogey at the 9th			0
the pressure was on by the time he got to the 13th and , quite extraordinarily , the man who once had the hopes of a continent on his shoulders and still holed a 6ft putt to win the @entity92 found he could not cope			0
just as he had on the 9th , he drove into a bush and had to take a penalty drop			0
just as at the 9th he played from a waste area of sand and came up 30 yards short			0
we knew he was in trouble by what happened next			0
@entity14 ’s old weakness used to be his chipping and weaknesses invariably show when a player is under the cosh			1
he caught the turf so far behind the ball it barely travelled a third of the intended distance , and he ended up with a calamitous triple bogey seven			0
northern irishman @entity70 eventually finished second behind @entity25 @entity70 had predicted earlier in the day that he would come second the man who had reached 23 under par for his first 58 holes had played the next seven in a bewildering six over			1
perhaps the only parallel for this in golf was when @entity121 lost a seven - shot lead with nine holes to play in the 1966 @entity76			1
@entity70 duly seized the moment			1
he birdied the 13th and the 15th			0
he knew an eagle was required at the par - five last and found himself needing to hole a bunker shot to achieve it			2
he played the shot beautifully , but the ball passed agonisingly by the edge of the hole			2
‘ i thought it had a chance to go in , ’ said the world no 1			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone expected @entity14 to lose his lead but i know as well as anyone what can happen			1
you make a couple of bad swings and lose confidence and guys behind you start holing putts			0
once you lose momentum , it ’s hard to get it back			0
’ @entity25 was a man in shock long after he was awarded the trophy			2
‘ what happened seems impossible , but i am very happy to get my first win , ’ he said .			0

@entity26 @entity25 won the @entity7 @entity8 *championship*
@entity14 had a 10 - shot lead in the final round in @entity8
but @entity14 collapsed late on and di n't even finish second
that spot was occupied by @entity158 @entity70
