by @entity0 you ca n't buy me love , goes the song - but it appears that money , or lack of it , can keep you in a dead relationship			1
nearly one in five people in the @entity9 say they have had to sustain a romance for longer than they wanted because they could not afford to break it off			0
a new poll has found that nearly a fifth ( 19 per cent ) of adults have at some stage in their lives remained with a partner purely because of their financial situation			2
this is equivalent to more than 9.5 million people across the country			0
a fifth of people have stayed with a partner longer than they wanted too because breaking up was too expensive of those who have stayed in relationships for longer than they wanted to , one in five ( 20 per cent ) did so for up to three months			2
however , the majority stayed with a partner they no longer wanted to be with for far longer			0
the realities of shared bills , rent and mortgages mean that separating is no longer just an emotional exercise worryingly , more than two - fifths ( 43 per cent ) of respondents admitted they had stayed in a relationship for a year or more after they thought it should end because their financial situation meant they did n’t feel they could leave			1
and a shocking quarter ( 24 per cent ) of these respondents remained in the romantic partnership for more than three years after things went stale			0
those aged between 25 and 34 years old are the most likely to remain with a partner just because of their joint finances , with nearly a third ( 31 per cent ) of this age group revealing they have done so at some point			0
this might be because it ’s at this age that people are most likely to take their first steps on the property ladder or start a family , and it compares to less than one in 10 ( 8 per cent ) over- 55s who have done the same			0
@entity63 has the highest proportion of couples admitting they have stayed together for the finances – and little else			1
more than a third ( 36 per cent ) of respondents in the capital revealed they have remained in a relationship for just this reason in the past , compared to just one in 10 ( 12 per cent ) people in the @entity74			0
spokesman for @entity77 , who conducted the study , @entity75 says : ' it ’s shocking to hear that so many people feel forced to stay in a relationship for longer than they want to because of their finances , but it ’s perhaps not that surprising			1
those aged 25 - 34 years old are the most likely to remain with a partner because of their joint finances , perhaps because it 's when people are most likely to take their first steps on the property ladder ' it ’s tough to end the bonds we create in a relationship , and financial ties can often be the hardest to break			1
' joint debts , mortgages or rent and childcare costs all play a part in people choosing to stay in a relationship when love breaks down , if they think they ’d be unable to afford these costs alone			1
data for @entity77 last year revealed 12 per cent of people seeking debt help did so as a result of a relationship break - up			2
' if finances start to spiral out of control when a relationship ends , the sooner people seek help with their debts , the sooner they can start to work towards getting back in control of their money			2

many now stay in a relationship after the love has gone *due* to finances
out of these two fifths stayed for a year , and a quarter stayed for over 3
@entity63 has the highest number of ' financial romances '
