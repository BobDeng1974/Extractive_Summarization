by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 15:22 est , 6 september 2013 since its unveiling last year , @entity1 has been touted as the ultimate in hands - free technology , yet the device 's head gestures , swipe bar and voice commands have n't been as easy to master as many people expected			1
to solve this problem , @entity10 has released a companion app , called @entity13 , that lets users control the device using an @entity17 smartphone , but that ultimately does away with the hands - free functions			1
the app makes it easier to navigate the device 's menus , simpler to take photos , read emails , add content to @entity26 and call contacts , for example			0
the @entity13 app , pictured , makes it easier for @entity1 wearers to navigate the device 's menus and makes it simpler to take photos , read emails , add content to @entity26 and call contacts , for example earlier this month the first pornographic app for @entity1 was released before being quickly banned			1
adult app store @entity41 , makers of the headmounted pornography , were told by @entity10 to remove the app and have been prohibited from making any such content			2
the ' @entity45 , ' app was downloaded from the developer 's website by 17 @entity1 owners on its debut day , while the site was visited by some 10,000 people			2
the app allowed viewers to browse adult content and , with @entity1 â€™s capability of displaying and recording , the app also reportedly allowed users to record and upload their own intimate content			2
according to the app 's description , it uses @entity1 ' screencast feature , which lets wearers share what they are seeing through the @entity1 visor using their @entity17 device 's screen			1
it says : ' remote control / input for screencast			0
touch / swipe / tap to control the @entity70 through the screencast experience			0
' the app has also been designed to make it easier to take photos and video ' surreptitiously ' , which may anger privacy campaigners further			0
a recent study from @entity79 - based web hosting company @entity78 with the @entity80 ( @entity81 ) at @entity82 found that one in five adults in the @entity85 wants to ban @entity1 completely because of privacy worries			0
according to the app 's description , it uses @entity1 ' screencast feature , which lets wearers share what they are seeing through the @entity1 visor , pictured , using their @entity17 device 's screen			1
the app has also been designed to make it easier to take photos and video ' surreptitiously ' researchers based in @entity79 surveyed 4,000 adults about the rise of wearable technology			0
despite 18 per cent of those questioned saying they plan to buy @entity1 when it goes on sale next year , 51 per cent expressed serious privacy concerns about the device and 69 per cent demanded greater regulation			0
some users have complained on @entity26 that the @entity13 app does n't work on their headset , although @entity109 notes that the headset might need an update to allow the use of remote controls in order to work .			1
