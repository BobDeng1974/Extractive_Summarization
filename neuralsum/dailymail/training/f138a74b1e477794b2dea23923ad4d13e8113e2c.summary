by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin after 353 long days and 10 painful test matches without a win , @entity1 finally has a reason to smile again			1
@entity6 ’s captain , whose job has been under huge pressure after a terrible run of results , saw his team destroy @entity12 to level the five - match series 1 - 1 — largely down to new hero @entity14			1
six wickets for @entity14 , who has been derided as a part - time off - spinner , helped @entity6 triumph by 266 runs in the third @entity20 , a victory to relieve the pressure on @entity1			1
@entity23 , who was man of the match , is accused of ‘ abusing and pushing ’ @entity40 in the @entity42 pavilion during the first test			1
but @entity1 called for justice @entity44 to clear @entity23 today , saying : ‘ i hope common sense prevails and we ’ll see @entity23 in his home test			1
’ @entity23 , sitting alongside @entity1 , said : ‘ i want to play at @entity38 but we ’ll have to wait and see			1
’ @entity12 officials have been privately insisting video evidence exists of @entity23 ’s contretemps with @entity40			2
they say it will support captain @entity53 ’s claim that @entity23 overstepped the mark and got physical with @entity12 ’s all - rounder			2
the @entity56 say they are unaware of the video but hope their supporting cast of witnesses — who include @entity61 and @entity62 — can persuade @entity44 to downgrade the charge from a @entity65 offence			0
@entity12 , hoping to overturn the fine levied on @entity40 for his part in the incident ( 50 per cent of his match fee , about £ 3,500 ) will be represented by @entity53 , coach @entity70 and physio @entity71 , among others			0
@entity23 , the leading wicket - taker in this series with 16 , said the hearing had been playing on his mind			1
blot : but the outcome of @entity23 's ( left ) assault charges still hangs over the team relief : but for now @entity1 can relax ahead of the fourth test ‘ it ’s been there since @entity42 , ’ he said			1
‘ this was somewhere near my best			0
we were relentless as a group of four seamers			0
our job is to maintain that throughout the series			0
’ at @entity12 will again be without injured seamer @entity93 , who wreaked havoc at @entity95			0
@entity6 named the same 13 for @entity96			2
‘ we never let @entity12 off the hook , ’ said @entity1 , who added that his own form with the bat , scoring 95 and 70 not out in the @entity82 , and the result had eased the pressure on his own position			2
‘ the weight is lifted , ’ he said			0
‘ to score runs under that pressure in the first innings meant a lot			0
’ he praised @entity14 , whose test - best figures of six for 67 wrapped things up — three days after sparking controversy by going out to bat wearing ‘ @entity112 ’ and ‘ @entity114 ’ wristbands			1
‘ i do n’t think he was affected , ’ said @entity1			0
‘ he took six and had the same smile			0

@entity1 has reason to smile against after third @entity20 victory
@entity6 have *previously* gone 353 days and 10 matches without a win
five - match series now level at 1 - 1 going into the fourth game
new hero @entity14 takes six wickets to help @entity6 triumph by 266 runs
@entity23 's *pending* assault charges still hang over the team
