@entity0 tried to persuade @entity1 to change his mind about international retirement when the @entity5 midfielder joined @entity6 on loan - but says he understands why the midfielder decided to quit after 106 caps			1
@entity10 face @entity11 at @entity12 on wednesday in their first game since their worst - ever @entity15 campaign and next monday are away to @entity16 in their first @entity18 qualifier			1
which is why @entity10 manager @entity0 asked @entity1 to play on in a midfield which has also lost @entity21			1
he actually confided with me at a fairly early opportunity that he was planning to go to @entity5 and to start a new life over there			0
i immediately discussed how that will affect his @entity10 future , so when he then came back to @entity6 to do the period of time there , i immediately contacted him again and asked him : “ what are you thinking ? ” ‘ and really what he did was what @entity21 did and said : “ look i do n’t want to turn my back on it			1
i ’ve enjoyed it and i ’ve enjoyed the work that we ’re doing			0
but there are issues that i have to consider and there are things for me to weigh up so i need a bit more time			0
i do n’t want to say no now , forget me , because if i can marry the things going on in my head i ’d like to carry on			0
” ‘ it was n’t a shock but , as with @entity21 , there was hope			0
’ nevertheless , @entity0 hopes that the likes of @entity94 can now step up in midfield			2
he said : ‘ it ’s been very encouraging for me to see @entity94 playing pain free and without any fitness issues and even more encouraging to see him playing well as i thought he did for @entity100 against @entity101			2
‘ i thought he was very , very good in the centre of midfield and that of course was encouraging because it leads you to hope and believe he could do the same thing in an @entity10 shirt			0
’ beginnings : @entity1 on his @entity10 debut - against @entity113 at the @entity114 in october 1999 call - up : in training with @entity115 ahead of his @entity10 debut 15 years ago good times : @entity1 celebrates with @entity118 after scoring against @entity119 in a @entity121 qualifier bad times : @entity1 reacts after missing his penalty in the shoot - out with @entity125 at the 2006 @entity15 senior men : @entity1 ( left ) talks with coach @entity128 ( second left ) , @entity129 and @entity21 ( right ) in training ahead of the 2006 @entity15 familiar feeling : @entity1 and @entity128 contemplate another tournament exit back in 2006 injustice : the shot from @entity1 that clearly beats @entity135 and crosses the line during @entity10 's defeat to @entity138 at the 2010 @entity15			1
