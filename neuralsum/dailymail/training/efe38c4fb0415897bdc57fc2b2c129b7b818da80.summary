by @entity1 reporter published : 02:25 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 11:19 est , 17 november 2013 this week 's edition of @entity3 fulfilled a long - held dream for one @entity6 native - host @entity5			1
before @entity5 's opening number , though , @entity3 managed to lampoon both embattled @entity9 mayor @entity8 and 60 minutes reporter @entity10 , both of whom have been in the news this week for all the wrong reasons			1
@entity15 's @entity14 holds even more disastrous press conferences than the ones the real @entity14 held last week in which he made reference to having oral sex with his wife and smoking crack			2
' then i ’m going to go on a show where people do believe me and will believe anything i say , ' says @entity15 's @entity14			0
the @entity28 tv host asked what show would possibly believe the mayor after his previous lies and transgressions			2
cut to @entity14 being interviewed on 60 minutes by @entity10 , who this week has issued a series of apologies for her report on the 2012 @entity45 attack			1
embattled : it 's been a tough week for both @entity10 ( left , played by @entity47 ) and @entity8 ( right , played by @entity15 ) write caption here vamp : @entity5 opened the show with a song and dance number @entity53 , played by @entity47 , introduces @entity14 as a ' @entity55 , hero , role model , ' before addressing @entity14 's numerous indiscretions			1
@entity53 asks @entity14 if he 's ever done crack , smoked marijuana or drunk alcohol , all of which he denies			0
' so mayor @entity8 , once and for all , what is the truth ? ' asks @entity53			1
' i have never done crack , ' responds @entity14			0
' ' i ’ve also never smoked pot. ' ' i believe you			0
' ' and i ’ve never had alcohol			0
' she believes him unreservedly			0
' oh , my @entity69			0
this is the best show , ' says @entity8			2
lampooned : the real life @entity10 and mayor @entity8 were the subject of @entity3 's first skit @entity5 opened the show , playing up her @entity6 roots to get the audience onside then admitting to loving getting ' cheap applause			1
' she launched into a rendition of her hit applause which then segues into an all - out @entity81 - inspired ' @entity6			0
' the hitmaker , who told fans earlier this week she 's been wanting to host @entity3 since she was ' four and three - quarters , ' appeared in her first skit as a nerdy @entity86 employee who is a guest on the imagined @entity87 and @entity89 morning show , waking up with @entity90			1
@entity91 : @entity5 's character in one skit claims to be the inspiration for @entity96 's character in ' @entity97 ' she pulled off a believable impression of @entity96 's character @entity97 in @entity97 in a skit about an eccentric co-op board , an overzealous stage mother , and child actor			1
@entity5 also addressed critics who said her hit song born this way was a rip - off of @entity109 's @entity108			2
a vogue - ing , pointy - bra - clad @entity5 sang her song @entity111 as part of a skit about bad cover songs			1
in a sketch called @entity116 2063 , @entity5 played an elderly , long - forgotten version of herself , who calls on a handy man just so she can tell him stories about herself			2
self - expression : @entity5 poked fun at rumors she got a little too much inspiration from @entity109 's ' @entity108 ' for her song ' @entity111 ' old lady gaga : @entity5 plays herself as an old woman whose fame is long forgotten at the end , she sat down at her piano and slowly sings the lyrics to one of her latest songs			1
' i live for the applause , applause , applause , ' she sings , presses a button on a machine that makes two tiny hands clap together			0
the hitmaker also performed two songs during the show , including her collaboration with @entity145 , do what u want with my body .			0

@entity3 managed to poke fun at @entity10 and @entity8 in the same skit
the 60 minutes reporter is *portrayed* interviewing @entity9 mayor @entity8 and believing every word he says
