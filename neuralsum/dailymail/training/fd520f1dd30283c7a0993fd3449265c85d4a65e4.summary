by @entity0 published : 07:04 est , 8 may 2013 updated : 07:09 est , 8 may 2013 sleep deprivation plays an important role in lowering the achievement of schoolchildren , according to new research			1
the study , carried out by @entity7 in the @entity8 , also found that the problem was particularly prevalent in developed countries - experts believe this is because of the increasingly technology - saturated culture children live in			0
according to the @entity14 , the international comparison found the @entity8 to have the highest number of sleep - deprived students , with 73 per cent of nine and 10 - year - olds , and 80 per cent of 13 and 14 - year - olds identified by their teachers as being adversely affected			1
the @entity8 has the highest number of sleep - deprived students , with 73 per cent of nine and 10 - year - olds , and 80 per cent of 13 and 14 - year - olds being affected in contrast , 47 per cent of primary schoolchildren across the world need more sleep , as do 57 per cent of secondary school pupils			1
the worst affected countries were found to be @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 while children who get the most sleep tended to be found in countries including @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
the researchers studied data about more than 900,000 schoolchildren in more than 50 countries			0
the children were asked to sit tests in maths , science and reading and the results from these tests were studied alongside interview responses from their teachers and parents about their sleep habits			0
the researchers believe that the prevalence of computers and mobile phones in children ’s bedrooms are primarily to blame for the sleep deprivation – partly because children stay awake using them , but also because looking at a screen before going to bed disrupts natural sleep patterns			1
@entity70 , of the @entity71 and @entity72 , told the @entity14 : ‘ if you are unable to concentrate , to attend mentally , you are unable to achieve at your optimal level , because your mind and body are in need of something more basic			0
children who are sleep deprived can not concentrate so teachers have to adapt their lessons which means that even the unaffected children are held back ‘ sleep is a fundamental need for all children			2
if teachers report such large proportions of children suffering from lack of sleep , it 's having a significant impact			2
‘ but worse than that , teachers are having to modify their instruction based on those children who are suffering from a lack of sleep			0
’ he explained that , as a result , the children who are suffering from a lack of sleep are driving down the achievement of all of the students			0
the researchers do , however , acknowledge that sleep deprivation is not the only indicator of academic success and that the ill - effects can be reversed if sleep levels are increased .			2

lack of sleep lowers a child 's academic achievement
worst affected are those in the @entity8 and @entity30
teachers are forced to adapt lessons for sleepy pupils
mobile phones , *televisions* and computers in children 's bedrooms have been blamed for sleep deprivation
