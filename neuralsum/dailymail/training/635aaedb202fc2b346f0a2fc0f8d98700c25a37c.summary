@entity0 is aiming to turn @entity1 into the @entity2 and make his mark on the famous old stadium like his @entity6 idol @entity5			1
@entity0 became the mandatory challenger for @entity10 's @entity9 heavyweight title after dismantling @entity11 at the @entity12 last month			1
he will once again headline a bill in @entity15 , at the @entity16 , on february 28 before attentions turn to arranging a world title showdown with @entity19 , @entity9 and @entity20 king @entity10 in the summer			1
@entity22 has suggested the national stadium or the @entity30 , home of his beloved @entity32 , as suitable venues for @entity0 's world title challenge , be it against @entity10 or for the vacant @entity9 crown should the @entity37 choose to relinquish the belt			1
but lifelong @entity6 fan @entity0 has other ideas			1
' i do n't know what these guys are on about , ' he said , in reference to @entity22 and his own promoter @entity44 , ' because they 're from @entity15 they want to fight here all the time			1
@entity10 holds the @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity9 heavyweight titles ' i 'm a big @entity6 fan so my dream fight would be at @entity1 against @entity10			1
' these guys want it at @entity32 or @entity28 but they 're not my team , @entity6 is my team			2
bar a few thousand tickets , it 's basically the same attendance by the time the chairs are on the pitch and all that			0
i 'm from @entity55 so it makes sense to do it in the north west			0
' the no 1 stadium in the country is obviously @entity28 – it 's the capital city and the biggest capacity so i understand why promoters want to put on fights there			2
but i 'm not from @entity15 , i 'm from @entity55 so i believe it should happen where i 'm from			0
' if i 'm going to fulfill my dream of fighting for the world heavyweight title and winning it then i want to do it at @entity1			2
it 's called the @entity1 and it 's where my dream will come true			0
' @entity1 memorably played host to the 1993 rematch between @entity75 and @entity76 when the fierce @entity78 rivals drew their @entity80 and @entity9 super-middleweight title clash in front of the @entity82			2
@entity83 dismantled @entity11 at the @entity12 last month since then , the city 's premier boxing venue has become the 21,000 - seater @entity86 , where local lads like @entity88 and @entity89 have had world title fights			2
but @entity0 reckons the time is right to take boxing back to the 104 - year - old home of @entity6			1
@entity0 , currently unbeaten after 23 fights , said : ' i think the town deserves a world heavyweight title fight			1
they 've got the two best football teams in the world so it deserves a big title fight in a stadium			2
' it would be a great night for me , as a lifelong @entity6 fan , and a big night for the city as well			1
it has never had a big heavyweight title fight there before and it could be a massive opportunity			2
@entity6 fan @entity0 wants to fight @entity10 at @entity1 @entity0 says he shares many similarities with @entity6 legend @entity5 ' i 've been down there quite a lot this year , i do a lot of charity things and events as well as go to games so i 'm down there often			1
i get mobbed on match days – it 's good			0
' @entity0 also revealed he has always admired one of the most controversial @entity6 icons of his generation – @entity121 great @entity5			1
the gifted striker is considered one of the club 's best ever players after scoring 89 goals in 193 games following his £ 1.2m move from @entity129 in 1992			0
but he also made headlines off the pitch , most memorably in january 1995 when he was banned for nine months and ordered to do 120 hours community service after an infamous flying kick on 20 - year - old @entity135 fan @entity134 , who had goaded the @entity121 from the stands			0
and , although he has so far refrained from sticking one on a punter , @entity0 is considered one of the most colourful characters in @entity78 boxing and thinks he and @entity5 have a lot in common			0
promoter @entity22 ( second left ) has his sights set on @entity15 showdown he added : ' i 've supported them all my life and my @entity6 idol is @entity5			1
he 's my hero of all time			0
people say there are similarities between us – we 're both crazy , we both say what we think and do what we want			0
' @entity0 has his doubts that @entity10 will ever agree to fighting him , and it has been suggested that the long - time champion , who calls himself dr @entity10 , does not want to deal with any of the @entity161 's antics			1
when asked whether @entity163 , the new father - of - one , might be cautious of travelling to @entity1 to fight @entity0 in his won backyard , the 6ft 9in traveler admitted : ' i do n't know			0
it 's just about getting him in the ring			0
listen , i would fight him in this room in front of 100 people , that 's how confident i am			0
it does n't matter if it 's in his back garden or anywhere , he 's still going to lose the fight			0
