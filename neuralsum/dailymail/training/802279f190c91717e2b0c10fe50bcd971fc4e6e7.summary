by @entity0 the crippled @entity3 nuclear plant has been given permission to build an underground ' ice wall ' , it has been revealed			1
the wall , approved by the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , will freeze soil around four reactors at the plant in northern @entity11			1
it aims to prevent radioactive water from escaping the site - as well as blocking groundwater from nearby hillsides flowing into the area			1
approved : the crippled @entity3 nuclear plant has been given permission to build an underground ' ice wall ' , it has been revealed			1
the wall will freeze soil around four reactors at the power plant in northern @entity11 the project , proposed by @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , will cost the @entity11 government an estimated 32billion yen ( £ 186million ) , according to the @entity28			1
and there will be no hanging around - with workers expected to start building the wall next month			1
it comes despite concerns about the move - with the @entity7 previously expressing fears that the frozen wall could cause the surrounding ground to sink			2
but yesterday , the agency accepted @entity26 's comment that although the ground may sink up to 16mm in some areas , it will not be significant enough to cause safety concerns			0
test : @entity26 workers install the frozen wall at the site during a feasibility test in early may speaking after the approval , @entity7 commissioner @entity47 told @entity49 : ' i think we have been able to confirm today the scale of ground sinking , which is what we have most feared as side effects of building the wall			1
' but mr @entity47 said other issues surrounding the project - including ways to measure the level of radioactive water inside the reactor buildings - are yet to be discussed			2
the wall , stretching 1.5km ( 0.9miles ) and nearly 100 feet deep , will be set up around reactors 1 to 4 at the @entity65 , which suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami			0
crippled : the wall , approved by the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , aims to prevent radioactive water from escaping the damaged site			1
it also strives to block groundwater from nearby hillsides flowing into the area workers will insert a line of pipes into the ground that circulate liquid as cold as -40c - causing the earth around them to freeze			2
as well as preventing polluted water from escaping the plant , the wall will also block groundwater from flowing into the buildings ' basements and mixing with highly radioactive water leaks from the melted cores			1
construction of the frozen wall is expected to finish in march next year , according to @entity93			0
as part of the project , @entity26 is also installing another groundwater drainage system around the reactor buildings , which some experts say could serve as a sufficient alternative to the wall			2
earlier this month , @entity101 , a former @entity102 chairman who now heads a supervisory panel for @entity26 , said he was not convinced the ' ice wall ' is the best way to prevent radioactive water from escaping the plant			1
he also claimed the @entity108 and @entity26 should review the plan to balance risk and benefit to see whether they should spend the money elsewhere			0
' any time you make a decision , it should be based on current , relevant science , and you have to strike a balance between science and policy , ' he said			0
' at the end of the day , it may be a good alternative			0
but i 'm just not convinced			0
' still recovering : the @entity65 plant suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami			0
above , smoke is pictured rising from reactor 3 at the nuclear power plant on march 21 , 2011 more than three years after the march 2011 meltdowns , the @entity3 plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water			2
repeated water leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades			0
they have also caused environmental concerns among local fishermen .			0

@entity145 ' ice wall ' was approved by the @entity7
it will freeze soil around four reactors at @entity3 power plant in @entity11
aims to prevent radioactive water from escaping and block groundwater
project will cost @entity11 government an estimated 32billion yen ( £ 186m )
workers from @entity26 will start building wall next month
