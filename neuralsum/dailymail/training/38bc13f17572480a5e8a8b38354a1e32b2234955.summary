@entity0 admitted it would be remiss of him not to put his personal differences with @entity3 to one side and seek advice from his predecessor after being named @entity9 's @entity8 captain for 2016			1
the 46 - year - old , who played in the biennial contest five times and was a vice-captain in 2010 and 2012 , was unanimously chosen ahead of @entity14 and @entity15 by a five - man selection panel at @entity17			1
' to be captain of the @entity19 is a huge honour that ranks up there with anything i 've achieved in the professional game			0
it 's right up at the very top , ' former @entity26 champion @entity0 said			2
@entity0 looks in good spirits after being announced as @entity9 's captain for the 2016 @entity8 clarke on the phone moments after being announced as @entity9 's new @entity8 captain @entity0 ( right ) is given his kit after he was given the nod ahead of @entity33 and @entity15 the selection panel consisted of the three most recent captains - @entity3 , @entity36 and @entity37 - along with @entity39 chief executive @entity38 and players ' representative @entity40			1
@entity3 and @entity0 's relationship has been severely strained since @entity0 put himself forward for the 2014 captaincy , having previously sent @entity3 a letter supporting the @entity46 's candidacy			1
and when @entity47 was named @entity49 captain in december 2012 , @entity0 suggested @entity37 should also be considered as ' whoever it is standing on that stage opposite @entity47 needs a huge presence '			1
@entity3 admitted last year his conversations with @entity0 were now ' short and sweet ' but @entity0 will consult @entity3 after the @entity46 's leadership at @entity56 received widespread acclaim			1
' it would be very foolish for me not to follow the same formula , ' @entity0 said			2
' with everything that came out of @entity56 and the unbelievable job that @entity3 did there , i would be foolish not to speak to @entity3 and all the other captains before that			2
@entity0 puts on his new top during the @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 ( from left to right ) @entity36 , @entity40 , @entity3 , @entity38 and @entity37 had a meeting at @entity17 on wednesday to pick @entity9 's captain for the 2016 @entity8 the five - man @entity8 panel pose for a photo ahead of their meeting at @entity17 on wednesday @entity0 kisses the @entity8 after @entity9 were victorious at the @entity77 in @entity46 in 2006 years played : 1997 ( winners ) , 1999 , 2002 ( winners ) , 2004 , 2006 ( winners ) @entity82 matches : 20 career record : won 10 lost 7 halved 3 total points won : 11.5 ' the team bonding and spirit they had at @entity56 is obviously something i would love to replicate			1
' i will try to pick off as much information as i can from all the previous captains			0
i think it would be very remiss of me if i did n't do that to try and pick out the bits that they thought worked best for the teams			0
' at the end of the day it 's not about me , it 's about the players and to try and make sure the team has an enjoyable week , which is quite difficult in a stressful atmosphere that the @entity8 is			2
but if the guys are relaxed and enjoy themselves that always helps a little bit more			0
' certainly with the teams that i have been involved in , both as a player and vice-captain , that has been a huge factor			0
' @entity3 reiterated that he would not act as vice-captain to @entity0 , or anyone else , but added : ' i will give him any support he needs			1
' at the same time it 's important i step away too			0
' @entity0 's now at the front and let him go ahead			1
it 's not necessarily about following me or following @entity36 or following @entity117 or anybody who has done it before and won			0
it 's about doing what 's best for him and how he sees it			0
' @entity0 said he has a ' few people in mind ' for his vice-captains and indicated he was likely to copy @entity3 and have five of them at @entity127 , where he is set to come up against good friend @entity128			1
love is set to be confirmed as @entity49 captain next week and @entity0 added : ' if so that would be wonderful			2
we 've played many practice rounds together and are very good friends			0
he is a gentleman and there is n't a nicer man in our sport			0
' @entity0 was vice-captain at the @entity139 at @entity140 in @entity141 @entity0 ( second left ) downs a drink as @entity144 ( left ) , @entity145 ( second right ) and @entity146 look on after @entity148 's victory in the 2006 edition of the battle with the @entity49 @entity0 in tears after winning his singles match at the @entity77 just a month after the death of his wife @entity154 the @entity8 is pictured at @entity17 on wednesday as the five - man panel met to choose the captain @entity157 ( left ) , @entity39 media communications director , and @entity8 director @entity159 annnounced that @entity0 will be @entity9 's 2016 @entity8 captain @entity128 was captain in 2012 when @entity9 produced the ' miracle at @entity161 ' to recover from 10 - 4 down on saturday afternoon and win by a single point			1
last year 's win at @entity56 made it three in succession and six of the last seven , something that @entity37 believes will make @entity0 's job all the harder			1
@entity37 told @entity168 : ' it 's an unenviable task ; @entity49 want it back badly and he will have all our support			0
they do want revenge , they set up their task force and had their own internal wranglings about what they can do to win it back			0
' we have selected a captain that i am convinced will retain the @entity8 and bring it home			2
i think he will be a very good communicator with the players individually , which is most important as a captain			0
he has the respect of the players			0
' the last of @entity0 's five appearances as a player was an emotionally - charged affair at the @entity77 in 2006 , when he somehow won all three of his matches just weeks after the death of his first wife @entity154 from cancer			2
@entity0 and long - time friend @entity146 played the final fourball match of the first session against @entity199 and @entity200 , with @entity0 hitting his opening drive more than 300 yards down the fairway , pitching to 12 feet and then holing for birdie			2
after failing to qualify for the next two contests , @entity0 was a surprise winner of the @entity206 at @entity69 's in 2011 , but has failed to record a single top - 10 finish on the @entity39 since			0
in contrast , @entity14 and @entity15 have remained competitive , with @entity15 making his third appearance as a player at @entity56 and 51 - year - old @entity14 extending his record as the @entity39 's oldest winner with victory in the @entity26 last year			1
