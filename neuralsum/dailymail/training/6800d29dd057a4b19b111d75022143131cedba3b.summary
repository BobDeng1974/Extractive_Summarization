by @entity0 published : 19:28 est , 4 january 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 5 january 2013 here is a certain sort of precocious child — usually the product of a star - struck mother — who wants more than anything to be really , really famous			1
growing up in a big house in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 was once such boy			1
in 2000 , when he was 12 , @entity13 , or ' @entity16 ' as he is known to his ­ doting parents , @entity15 auditioned for the part of @entity19 in @entity20 , the first film in the series			2
he lost out , of course , to @entity23			2
each successive film — and @entity23 's mounting fame and riches — was a cruel reminder to ' @entity16 ' and his family of what might have been			2
crude : @entity13 ( left ) caused controversy with jokes about the @entity32 on @entity33 2012 this week , however , at the age of 24 , the comedian has finally got the attention he has always craved			1
his name has been in the papers virtually all week following his ­ controversial appearance on @entity40 's @entity33 2012 last sunday — although not for positive reasons			1
@entity42 , who was on the show with friend and fellow comic @entity46 , as well as @entity47 and @entity48 , began by cracking lewd ' jokes ' about the @entity32 and prince @entity51 before making a series of ­ infantile , sexually explicit remarks about sprinter @entity54 and singer @entity55			1
during the show , he drank roughly a ­ bottle of wine and appeared intoxicated , sparking speculation that alcohol was to blame for his puerile display			1
not so , according to one who knows him			2
' what we saw on the show is what you get away from the cameras , ' says the acquaintance			2
' he comes out with the most unbelievably crass things , he 's incredibly ­ childish			1
he has been very spoilt all his life and thinks he can say what he likes			1
' but where did baby - faced @entity42 , whose new beard looks quite incongruous against his pink cheeks , acquire such blithe confidence ? a clue may lie in his background , which is about as luvvie - ish as you can get			1
his father is @entity85 , 72 , a former theatrical agent turned producer			2
his clients over the years have included @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , ­ @entity92 and @entity93			2
outrage : @entity42 appeared with other comedians , including @entity47 , @entity95 and @entity46 mother @entity96 , 51 , is a former actress ( stage name @entity98 ) who retrained as a ' doula ' — someone who assists a pregnant woman before , during and after childbirth			1
@entity13 has a sister @entity102 , 23 , and 20 - year - old brother , @entity103			1
his godfather is actor @entity105 , an old showbiz friend of both his parents			2
@entity85 's first wife , whom he married in 1969 , was @entity108 , who went on to marry the lyricist @entity109			0
he also had a ­ relationship with @entity111 , who later married @entity112			0
in 1989 , mr @entity13 was involved in a high - profile @entity114 action brought by a former long - term lover , @entity116 , who tried to claim a share of his homes and assets			1
miss @entity116 , who told the court of lavish champagne parties thrown by mr @entity42 for stars such as @entity105 , @entity123 and @entity124 , lost the case			1
over the years , mr @entity13 , the author of @entity126 , a waspish account of the showbusiness world , has had ­ various production companies , which have left him very well - off			2
last year , the family sold their six - bedroom house overlooking @entity133 for £ 4.25 million and moved to another house overlooking the @entity135 nearby , for which they paid £ 2.55 million			1
the new property is mortgage - free			2
privately educated : the comedian went to the £ 24,000 - a - year @entity139 in @entity140 born into such a gilded showbiz set , it is little wonder @entity13 has achieved tv fame at such a young age			1
he ­ certainly started young			0
at the age of four , he and sister @entity102 appeared in @entity147 , a television series produced by their father , and starring their mother and @entity105			0
he was privately educated at @entity151 in @entity12 and £ 24,000 - a - year ­ @entity139 in @entity140			1
another pupil , the @entity152 , then @entity153 , was five years his senior			0
there were lots of auditions as he was growing up and he talked about his attempt to play @entity19 on @entity161 's @entity160 programme			0
it was aired two days ago but was recorded before the furore over the @entity33 erupted			1
' that was very much driven by my mother , ' he said			0
' she was very excited			0
she bought us all the books			0
weirdly , the audition process came to my school and they did an open audition where one of the cast agent 's assistants looked at loads of different pupils to see if any of them would work in the film			0
' my @entity179 , being an agent at the time , said : ' this is nonsense , @entity13 , we 're not sending you off to some open audition			0
they never find anyone from an open audition			0
i 'll get you a one - to - one because i know @entity188 's ( the producer ) mother , i used to work with her			2
' ' he knows all these people , so he said : ' i 'll get you in the door			0
' mockney : @entity42 ditched his earlier attempts to play down his posh background ' my @entity195 made me up to look like @entity19 , put me in round framed glasses , did the hair so i looked just like @entity19 , so i went in and completely fluffed it , had n't read the book , so when she was ­ asking me who the scariest villain was			1
i completely forgot the name of the character and i did n't get it			0
' my @entity179 was very disappointed because he thought that could have been his gold ticket to @entity206			0
' when @entity42 began touring on the comedy circuit , he tried to ­ disguise his plummy voice and acquired a ' @entity192 ' accent , which he thought would go down better with audiences			1
when it did n't , he changed his routine and began playing up to his ' posh public schoolboy ' background			0
the @entity215 , according to an acquaintance , are very aspirational and do n't mind if people think they are more posh than they are			0
' they 're rather like the @entity218 , ' explains a source			0
the @entity179 sounds like a character from @entity222			0
' @entity42 talked about the class issue on @entity160			1
' it 's a weird one			0
i never know what defines you as being posh , ' he said			0
' i went to a posh school , definitely			0
people at @entity139 were all trying to hide the fact we were posh			0
' and my @entity179 is very , very middle class , and he came from not a ­ middle - class background and ­ neither did my @entity195 , so i guess i 'd be first generation posh			2
' he became friends with @entity46 and @entity236 — stars of the sitcom @entity239 — on the comedy circuit			2
and he admits they got him his big break in television when they ' bullied ' the producers of @entity247 's @entity246 into ­ giving him an opportunity to present the show in 2009			0
who says it does n't help to have friends in the business ? in 2010 , @entity42 was nominated for best newcomer at the ­ @entity256 comedy awards and he became a ­ regular on @entity259 's @entity258 and was also a guest ­ presenter of @entity259 2 's pop quiz @entity263			1
early on , @entity42 discovered he could find easy laughs by pushing the boundaries of good taste			1
during the recording of @entity160 , he recalled : ' the first time i ever did live at the @entity270 , i was doing a routine about sex and i looked out into the audience and i saw @entity274 , because he was one of the ­ celebrities they had invited			0
newcomer : @entity42 made his acting debut last year as @entity279 in @entity40 comedy drama @entity280 ' and it triggered this memory , which is a true story , that i lost my virginity in one of his establishments , which is a restaurant hotel that he had , and i said this			1
' i blurted it out on stage and then did some jokes about it , then came out at the interval and found my @entity195 apologising to @entity274 , saying : ' i 'm so sorry			2
he does this all the time			0
we have no control over him			0
'' in june 2010 , the @entity295 published pictures of @entity42 snorting cocaine through a £ 20 note at the side of the road outside a nightclub in @entity302			1
there was a time when such a thing could have destroyed a young performer 's career , but the episode was just a minor blip for @entity42			1
he made his acting debut in 2011 in the @entity40 comedy drama @entity280 , in which he plays @entity279 , a public schoolboy who failed to get into a good university			0
starring alongside him was @entity314 , who had previously appeared with @entity315 in the @entity317 drama , @entity318			0
the pair became an item and last year moved into a £ 2.6 million flat in @entity321 — bought with a £ 1 million deposit from @entity42			1
good education : the star of bad education is said to enjoy the attention of young female fans the couple 's neighbours include @entity330 , @entity331 and chancellor @entity332			2
finding the funds should n't have been too much of a strain for @entity42			1
his company , @entity335 , has assets of £ 600,000 and accounts to the end of january 2012 show a profit of just over £ 400,000			1
before this week , @entity42 's star showed no sign of waning			1
last year , he appeared in a @entity344 comedy drama about a young teacher , @entity325 , which he wrote			0
those in his circle say fame has made him more cocksure and ­ unrestrained than ever and that he particularly enjoys the attention of the young female fans of @entity280 and @entity325			2
he is said to be unfazed by all the outrage following his latest tv appearance , and actually rather enjoying it			1
' he 's delighted , ' says a source			0
' he thinks it 's going to do wonders for his career			1
' later this month , @entity42 was due to present a prize at the @entity359			1
a producer of the show said earlier this week there would be a meeting to decide if he should withdraw , but it appears that he will present the award as planned			0
at least he 's got a few weeks to think of a decent joke .			0

a puerile display has finally got the comedian the attention he has craved
he cracked infantile , lewd jokes throughout @entity33 2012
@entity32 , prince @entity374 and @entity55 are among his childish targets
friends say he has been ' very spoilt ' and ' thinks he can say what he likes '
privately educated @entity42 grew up in a six - bedroom £ 4.25m house
an unfazed @entity42 thinks latest outrage ' will do wonders for his career '
