all of them set up dates to meet with prostitutes at local a hotel using the classified ads site backpage.com			2
district attorney @entity24 said police started a sting operation in april after receiving numerous complaints about prostitution at hotels across the county			1
wall of shame : district attorney @entity24 said she hopes that this poster of the 104 men arrested in a prostitution sting will put men on notice that they will be humiliated if they try to buy sex in @entity1 it 's unknown how many of the men arrested were married and whether any of their spouses had to wait until the public release of information today to learn of their infidelity			1
@entity1 divorce lawyer @entity47 says he has had four women come to him seeking divorces because their husbands were charged with soliciting prostitutes			1
about 20percent of marriages where a wife finds out her husband has been cheating - with a hooker or otherwise - will end in divorce			2
such divorces are usually bitter			0
' there ’s much more feelings involved			0
the cases are often high - conflict cases involving a spouse that will now question the husband ’s decision - making abilities and wish to limit his access to young children			0
she may not trust the husband so the spouse will want to freeze assetts and get up - front payment if the husband ’s finances may be going to other woman , ' @entity47 told @entity74			0
the other 80percent of men will eventually be forgiven by their wives - often after marriage counseling and significant amounts of contrition			2
' but , basically , four out of five guys get away with it , ' @entity47 says			0
all walks of life : the arrested men ranged in age from 17 to 79			1

most , 79 , came from @entity1 and 25 traveled from out of town			2
the suspects also include two doctors , two dentists , two engineers , two college professors , two college students , a teacher , a stockbroker and a car salesman			0
@entity47 says in his experience , busy professionals who are n't getting enough attention from their wives are more likely to look for extra-marital sex from prostitutes than from a mistress			2
' these are people who do n’t have the time to go out to court a woman or an affair			0
they can just hook up very easily and be done , ' @entity47 says			0
' they do n’t have to do three dinenr dates and two nights out and explain that to their families			0
' but , he cautioned , wives often profit handsomely if that affair results in divorce			0
' @entity137 distribution of assets does not mean equal distribution			0
the wife does n’t split everything 5/50 , especially if she can prove special circumstances such as a humiliating arrest around the time of a bar mitzvah or graduation , ' he said			0

' not only do people have a right to know who their prosecutors and police are arresting and charging with crimes , but we know that the commission of this specific crime is dramatically affected by the perceived risk of getting caught , ' she said			0
' we are giving fair warning to johns that the risk is growing rapidly			0
' but one @entity1 criminal defense lawyer who is representing men arrested in the sting is crying foul			1
@entity209 told @entity74 that @entity148 ' decided to publicly shame the men who are still legally innocent			0
