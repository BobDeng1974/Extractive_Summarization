three college friends from @entity1 who spotted a buck trapped in a sinkhole on their way to a football game were struck by pangs of guilt as they drove on by so decided to turn around and save the deer			1
before attempting their selfless rescue mission , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 made a pit - stop at @entity14 to get rope and clips and made their way back to the field owned by @entity11 's father			1
once there the friends made quick work of the task at hand , pulling the deer out of the 10 - foot - deep hole using only a rope and their bare hands			1
scroll down for @entity28 rescuers : the three friends assess the situation after to save the buck which had fallen down the sinkhole obviously the antlers and the scared deer made their rescue dangerous , so the friends had to work a slip knot to the deer which would come free once they had pulled it out of its hole			1
' i was almost down to my knees reaching down in there , so they jumped on my legs to keep me from falling in , ' said @entity10 , 20 , to the @entity47			2
' it was just something you do n't get the opportunity to do , rescue a deer			2
so you get the chance and you take it			0
' @entity12 positioned his smartphone onto the truck to record the rescue , which happened last month			1
heave : the three friends begin to drag the deer to safety carefully pulling on the buck 's antlers up and away : the friends dart away from the deer as it bolts straight out of the sinkhole after getting trapped laughter : once free the friends begin shouting out their delight at having rescued the deer from the hole the three friends later posted the footage onto @entity68 and it has been viewed more than 30,000 times since			2
the friends managed to yank the startled buck up by its antlers inch by inch , taking care to position themselves away from the deer so that they could run if it charged			1
once it reached the top it darted right then left and bolted away , leaving its amused rescuers shouting at the top of their voices at their own effort			0
' the animal was in distress			0
these kids took a shot at it and in this case you 've got to say they did the right thing , ' said @entity91 , an @entity93 spokesman to the @entity47			0
according to the @entity47 , two of the men are in fact deer hunters , but they said in fact , that was what made them rescue the deer			0
' either one of us would have taken it if we had the opportunity to , so we wanted to let it live , ' @entity10 said			0
