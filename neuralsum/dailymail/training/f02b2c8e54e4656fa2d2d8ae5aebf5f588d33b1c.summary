back to @entity23 ? a couple living in the upscale @entity4 neighborhood of @entity5 have revealed that they use chamber pots because they do not have a bathroom ( stock photo ) @entity13 tells the @entity29 : ' it 's what people have been doing for hundreds - thousands - of years			1
' she explains that they empty the chamber pots in the gutter on the street in the early morning , then rinse them down with water			0
chamber pots did take some getting used to though , @entity14 admits			1
' let 's just say it was summer when we moved in , ' he recalls			0
' we do n't have or ideologically support air conditioning , so nights could get a little rough , especially when you do n't know what to expect when you lift the lid ... it 's not necessarily for the squeamish			0
' ' we do n't have air conditioning so nights could get a little rough ... it 's not necessarily for the squeamish ' nor , @entity14 adds , was one chamber pot enough			1

the couple now actually take some pride in the chamber pots they use , sourcing sea glass - glazed versions from a local artist			2
@entity13 loves them so much , she has been buying extras to give as gifts to friends , adding that she ' [ has n't ] heard any complaints '			1
they are preferable to metal , @entity14 reveals , which ' can be obtrusive in personal places '			2
the handmade versions are also more akin to the kind that were used by the building 's residents 150 years ago			0
picturesque : @entity5 is considered one of the most desirable parts of @entity4 - and it seems some residents are prepared to make some serious sacrifices for the privilege of living there ( stock photo ) ' it 's helped us feel closer to the building , to its history , and to each other , ' he says			1
