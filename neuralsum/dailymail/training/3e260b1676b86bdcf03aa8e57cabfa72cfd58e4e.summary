the pie - scraper is thought to be the world 's tallest burger - incorporating 10 three - quarter pound cheeseburgers and another 11 - and - a - half pounds of beef encasing pies , sausage rolls , a bacon butty , spam and spaghetti bolognese			1
takeaway boss @entity23 of the @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26 , @entity27 , is the man behind the towering dish , which comes with 8.5kg of beef and is served with a side salad of lettuce			1

' i ’ve researched to see if anyone has created a taller burger but no one has , ' he said			0
' we ’ve already created a full burger encased inside another burger so i just thought why not try other things inside a burger ? say , a pork pie , a chip butty or a pizza ? ' mr @entity23 and his wife @entity54 , 39 , spent an hour - and - a - half assembling the structure on a specially - made metal stand to ensure the tower did n’t topple			1
the three - quarter pound cheeseburger surrounded by chips is the first rung on the ladder , followed by a pork pie with @entity64 pickle encased in one - and - a - quarter pounds of beef			1
each burger bun needed to be extra-large so they were also made to order from a local baker			0
then between each cheeseburger lies a different meal encased in burger meat			1
if that was n’t enough to lay claim to @entity113 ’s biggest burger , above each cheeseburger is a layer of bacon with added hash browns , onion rings and peppers at different levels for good measure			2
mrs @entity2 said : ' everyone thinks we are a bit nuts but they are n’t surprised by the things we do now			2
it ’s just about putting a smile on people ’s faces and trying to do things bigger and better every time			0
' due to its sheer size , the burger was only on display at the popular chippy for a day , before it was then devoured by staff and a few lucky customers			1
those who would like to fork out and cook a replica would be set back £ 150 - but mrs @entity2 admits it could never be sold			2
' it ’s a bit of fun and everyone loves a good challenge , ' she added			0
' and it ’s not just the gimmick - i can honestly say the pizza burger is delicious ! ' mr and mrs @entity2 spent an hour - and - a - half constructing their masterpiece , displaying it at their mister eaters @entity24 in @entity26 , @entity27 for a day before it was devoured by staff and a few customers 68081 66084 46162 42052 72911 293826 237750 72029 362441 177633 388912 133631 the @entity156 are no stranger to cooking up extravagant menu options , with 10,000 - calorie cheeseburger encased in another burger @entity162 owners @entity23 and mrs @entity2 are no strangers to cooking up extravagant ideas			1
the couple turned giant tv cartoon food into reality by creating a 10,000 - calorie burger			2
dubbed the ‘ @entity169 ’ , the sandwich is a cheeseburger encased in another burger and held together by two buns , also made from burgers			2
the dish was being sold for £ 20 at the couple 's mister @entity174 in @entity26			0
it is modelled on a meal from @entity181 episode of @entity182 hit @entity183			0
in the show , the characters of @entity185 , a @entity186 and a raccoon named @entity188 do everything they can to try and eat the burger , which is so good it can only be sold to one customer every 100 years			0
but fans can now get their hands on a real - life version of the calorific creation for free - only if they dare to take on the challenge of finishing it in one			0
anyone who attempts the @entity201 - style challenge will have to consume five pounds of beef , as well as six slices of cheese and three whole buns			0
mrs @entity2 , said : ‘ i saw a few people had tried to make it on @entity208 but they were terrible			0
