the @entity0 have today issued a grovelling apology for killing an elderly cat against its family 's wishes and then making a bungled attempt to prosecute them			1
@entity8 and his wife @entity9 suffered two years of trauma after an @entity0 inspector seized their cat , 16 - year - old @entity13 , in may 2013 , claiming that he was too thin and had matted fur			1
after 24 hours of agonising negotiations @entity13 was put to sleep by a local vet against the wishes of @entity19 and mrs @entity20 - who were threatened with prison and fines if they refused to sign the release form			1
traumatic : @entity9 and @entity8 and their two teenage children , @entity29 , 15 , and @entity30 , 13 , had their pet cat @entity13 taken away and put down by the @entity0 in may 2013 the @entity0 put the animal to sleep before the distraught family could even say goodbye			1
the couple were then individually charged with cruelty and taken to court and the case hung over them for 15 months			2
the charges were eventually overruled by the @entity41 in august 2014 - but only after the family had been wrongly condemned by the @entity0 for ill - treating their beloved cat			1
@entity13 , who they adopted as a six - month - old kitten , always had extremely thick hair and spent his life trying to avoid being groomed			1
he hated it so much that a vet would have to place him under anaesthetic before attempting a trim			0
hated grooming : @entity13 had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted			2
the @entity0 saw this as a sign of animal cruelty the couple 's daughter @entity20 ( pictured with @entity13 ) was not allowed to say her final goodbyes to the cat the vet , who advised the @entity0 , said she had no concrete evidence @entity13 was suffering and claimed his matted hair and thin frame were not valid reasons for putting him down			1
however , an @entity0 inspector insisted @entity13 should be put to sleep immediately			1
a postr - mortem examination later revealed @entity13 was in relatively good health			2
the @entity0 publicly apologised to @entity19 and mrs @entity20 today over the ' upset and deep distress caused both to them and their children '			2
it said : ' the @entity0 acknowledges that the way in which it intervened in taking @entity13 from his home and the subsequent treatment of @entity19 and mrs @entity20 at that time was disproportionate and insensitive and fell short of the standards of compassion the public are entitled to expect of the @entity0			2
distressing : the couple were individually charged with cruelty and taken to court and the case hung over them for 15 months until it was overruled by the @entity41 in august 2014 ' specifically , the @entity0 accepts that its decision not to defer euthanasia so that @entity19 and mrs @entity20 ' children could say goodbye to the pet cat they had known their entire lives caused great and unnecessary distress to the whole family			1
' the @entity0 also admitted making a number of public responses which presented @entity19 and mrs @entity20 ' in an unfavourable light to the public '			0
mr and mrs @entity20 , from @entity101 , @entity102 , adopted @entity13 from a friend as a six - month - old kitten when they moved to the rural town in the late nineties			1
they have two children , @entity29 , 15 , and @entity30 , 13 , who were devastated at losing @entity13 , who was regarded as ' the original member of the family '			2
angry : accountant @entity8 said : ' i 'll never forget having to stand in a dock and plead not guilty on my birthday ' the family had accepted that @entity13 was nearing the end of his life when the incident took place and he would probably be put to sleep within months			1
however , they wanted to have one last summer with their beloved animal			0
a plea to allow the children to see their pet one last time was ignored			0
accountant mr @entity8 , 53 , today condemned the @entity0 for treating his family like criminals and called on the attorney general to look at its role			1
he said : ' i am glad they have made the apology public but it has taken a long time to get it out there			0
' it does n't get @entity13 back and we are not happy , but we do feel vindicated			0
every contact with them has been damaging			0
' i have n't considered any financial action , but that is something to discuss with my lawyer			0
' our children have n't been involved in this since @entity13 was put down as we have tried to keep them away from everything			0
' but i do n't think my daughter will ever get over not saying goodbye to @entity13 and not seeing him again			0
' he added : ' the @entity0 has been shocking from start to finish , treating us like criminals when all we 've done is care for our cat			1
' i will not forget having to stand in a dock and plead not guilty on my birthday			0
' they released statements which were full of lies and i have nothing but contempt for them			0
' the attorney general should look at the @entity0 and see if it is fit to conduct these private prosecutions			0
from our view they are not fit for purpose			0

@entity8 and @entity168 , of @entity102 , were ' treated like criminals '
their cat @entity13 , 16 , was put down by the @entity0 for having matted fur
but couple say he hated being groomed and was actually well - treated
@entity0 also wrongly took them both to court on animal cruelty charges
they 've now issued grovelling apology for causing the family such distress
