@entity21 said : ‘ i do n’t have an adequate explanation for my state of mind			2
' she later added : ' i ca n’t really explain why my mind did what it did maybe because it ’s too horrible			0
i really do n’t know the answer why i blacked out and have memory gaps on that day			2
’ she explained another question , which asked how she remembered every sexual encounter but did not remember stabbing @entity85 and dragging his body into the shower , by saying : ' i do n’t know how the mind works but i know june 4 was the most traumatic experience of my life			1
' i do n’t have other blackouts , i have a very good memory			2
the only way i can explain it is like a computer screen that freezes ... you hit the keys but nothing happens			0
one juror posed the question as to whether @entity100 had ever sought treatment for her ' mental condition '			0
the defendant looked confused before responding : ' i 'm not sure what mental condition that refers to			0
' explanations : @entity21 , 32 , gave detailed responses to questions from the jury with many queries focusing on why she did not remember much of june 4 , 2008 , the day that @entity2 was killed several queries were related to her @entity56 faith			1
' why were the laws of attraction so important to follow and the law of chastity was not ? ’ @entity21 said : ' i believed i was following the law of chastity for a long time - i realize now i was not ... there was a lot of temptation and weakness when it came to hanging out with @entity85			1
’ there were more general questions about @entity21 ' personality in other relationships as she answered for the entire day in court			1

’ jurors had dozens of questions for the murder suspect over the details of the day that @entity53 was killed			1

@entity175 and attorneys worked on wednesday morning to whittle down the list of questions for @entity21 as objections were raised in private			1
many other states , including @entity50 , allow jury questions at the judge 's discretion , but not all agree it 's a good idea			2
' it becomes too difficult , too tempting for a juror to lose their role as an impartial fact - finder and slip into the role of an advocate , and i think that 's contrary to what the whole justice system is based upon , ' said @entity198 - area defense attorney @entity197			2
' in effect , you 've deputized the jurors as investigators , ' @entity197 added			0
others , however , say the practice is a useful tool aimed at getting to the truth of a case , and provides attorneys on both sides a window in the deliberation room while the trial is still ongoing , giving lawyers time to change their strategies			0
negotiations : judge @entity25 and attorneys @entity217 , left , @entity218 and @entity219 , right , go over questions submitted by jurors at the murder trial of @entity2 on wednesday @entity31 criminal defense attorney @entity223 said the questions of a witness , during a case where he was representing a client charged with murder , once led to prosecutors offering a deal to plead to a lesser count			1
' in the end , what this is all really about is the search for truth , and any mechanism that allows jurors to get closer to the truth without prejudicing one side or the other , i think , is a good tool , ' @entity223 said			0
' and it really is a window into the juror 's mindset , ' he added			0
' it can help attorneys direct which way you need to go , what path you should take			0
' @entity21 initially told authorities she had nothing to do with @entity53 's death then blamed it on masked intruders before settling on self - defense			1
her repeated lies to authorities , friends and family in the days after his death , and her methodical efforts to create an alibi and avoid suspicion have been center stage throughout the trial as she explained how she remembers little from the day of the killing			1
@entity53 had been shot in the head , stabbed 27 times and had his throat slit			1
doomed : @entity2 , 32 , is on trial for the murder of on - off boyfriend @entity2 whom prosecutors say she killed in a jealous rage while she claims self - defense none of @entity21 ' allegations have been corroborated by witnesses or evidence during the trial , and she has admitted to lying repeatedly prior to and after her arrest , but @entity21 insists she is telling the truth now			1
she has acknowledged that she dumped the gun in the desert , got rid of her bloody clothes , and even left the victim a voicemail on his cell phone within hours of killing him and dragging his body into the shower			0
@entity21 ' grandparents had reported a .25 caliber handgun stolen from their @entity50 home about a week before the killing - the same caliber used to shoot @entity53 - but @entity21 says she never knew her grandfather had the weapon			2
