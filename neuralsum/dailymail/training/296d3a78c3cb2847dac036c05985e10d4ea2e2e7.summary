by @entity0 last updated at 7:04 am on 16th december 2011 proud : @entity2 's headteacher @entity1 , whose school is one of the best - performing in the country the devastating extent to which primary schools are failing bright pupils was revealed yesterday			1
up to 51,000 11 - year - olds who achieved top grades at age seven have effectively gone backwards after being left to coast in maths and @entity13			1
four in ten youngsters who were above average in the three rs at seven are failing to fulfil their early promise , official league tables show			2
around half of primary schools – more than 7,500 – have failed to get each of their brightest pupils up to the highest grades in @entity25 tests at 11			1
among these schools , more than 800 could not get all their young high achievers even up to the national average			2
this left around 1,300 pupils at a disadvantage when they started secondary school in september			2
despite their flying start , they were still struggling to grasp the point of a story , write sentences using commas or add , subtract , multiply and divide in their heads			0
the @entity40 has identified a hard core of 15 schools where more than 20 per cent of pupils who were high attainers at seven sank to the ranks of the lowest achievers at 11			2
schools minister @entity47 said the government was ‘ shining a light ’ on these schools			2
critics claim the figures are a damning indictment of a league table culture which has encouraged schools to concentrate on youngsters of low to middle ability at the expense of the brightest			0
schools are judged on how well they do in getting pupils to level four , the expected standard , in the basics and many teachers focus their efforts on borderline pupils to improve their league table positions			1
the @entity40 yesterday published school - by - school data for around 15,000 state primaries in @entity13 , based on national curriculum test results in @entity13 and maths			1
the tables reveal for the first time how low , middle and high achieving pupils at seven go on to perform in the @entity25 tests four years later			0
the statistics show that more than 2,000 primary schools are serving their middle achievers better than their brightest pupils in @entity13 lessons			1
there is at least a 20 percentage point gap in the levels of progress made by middle versus high achievers in the subject in 2,160 schools			0
this emphasis has also contributed to 11 per cent of children – around 32,000 – who were ‘ middle ’ achievers at seven rising to join the ranks of the highest achievers at the age of 11			0
the figures show that 74 per cent of pupils achieved level four in both @entity13 and maths this year , up one percentage point in 12 months			1
the proportion of bright boys and girls exceeding the standard expected – level five – fell by four percentage points to 29 per cent in @entity13 and increased by one percentage point in maths to 35 per cent			1
professor @entity106 of @entity107 said children in the top ability range are ‘ perhaps too often left to their own devices ’			0
he said : ‘ the way schools are judged has a massive effect on their behaviour			0
if they are asked to account for how many children are getting to level four , that ’s where their effort is going to go			0
‘ we do n’t do enough for the really able in our education system			0
’ nearly one in ten state primary schools face possible closure or takeover after failing to hit @entity126 targets in the three @entity127 nationally , 1,310 are falling short of @entity129 benchmarks in @entity13 and maths			1
ministers have already identified the 200 worst primaries which will be pulled out of local authority control and turned into academies under new leadership teams as early as next september			0
hundreds more will now be ordered to improve or face similar intervention			0
the head of one of the country ’s best primary schools has attacked the @entity126 ’s education reforms			2
@entity142 , of @entity143 in @entity144 , claimed yesterday that the changes would focus on facts instead of skills , and said : ‘ do we want a society that ’s great at pub quizzes or one that ’s great at thinking and problem solving ? ’ nearly all the 34 children at his school taking @entity13 and maths tests exceeded the standard expected of their age to gain the higher level five .			1

1 in 3 pupils fails to reach the expected standard in @entity13 and maths
10 *%* of boys leave primary school with reading age of 7
failing schools ' risk takeover '
