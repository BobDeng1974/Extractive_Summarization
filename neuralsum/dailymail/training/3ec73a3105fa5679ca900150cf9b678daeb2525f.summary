@entity0 has spoken on camera for the first time about being raped by her future husband @entity3 in a new documentary tackling sexual violence			1
the 81 - year - old actress , who has previously written about the ordeal in her autobiography , tells how she was drugged and raped at the age of 17 when she was still a virgin and explains how her guilt drove her to marry the perpetrator of the crime			1
the emotional admission appears in @entity14 , a film which sees former @entity16 @entity14 , @entity17 , travel the globe meeting fellow victims			1
@entity17 was raped in 1998 , six weeks before she was crowned @entity14 and has made it her life 's mission to encourage other women to speak out			1
' i was raped when i was seventeen years old , ' says the star			2
at the time the actress had just been signed to rank film studios and was already tipped for success			1
@entity0 then describes how she was on a date with @entity41 actor @entity3 ( who died in 1974 ) , when he went to take a bath			1
he gave her a rum and coke to drink and some books to read			2
' the books were porn , which i ’d never seen before			2
hardcore porn , ' the 81 - year - old remembers			1
talking to @entity17 on the documentary , @entity0 says : ' i was raped when i was seventeen years old ' the actress with @entity41 actor @entity3 , who drugged and raped her when they were first dating what happened next has stayed etched in the the actress 's memory for the last 64 years			1
' the next thing i knew , i was out flat on the sofa in that living room and he was raping me			2
and what he had given me was a drug			2
he had drugged my drink			2
' it was what is called in those days a @entity66			2
which i think today would be @entity67			2
. that i 'd done this thing			2
' in her naivety , a young @entity0 felt terrible guilt			2
' it was n’t my fault but i did n’t know , i went out with him			0
and maybe i should n’t have gone out with him			0
he was much older than me , and he was a famous star , ' she says			0
' and anyway the bottom line is that he called me , and i went out with him again			0
and after i 'd been going out with him for a few months , he asked me to marry him			0
' and i thought , " well i better because you know , he took my virginity			0
" i really hated him , but i was so filled with guilt , that he had done this thing to me			0
' the actress then admits			2
' it took a long time to be able to really trust any man			0
' @entity17 , who was raped just weeks before she was crowned @entity14 , talking to @entity0 on the documentary @entity17 , 34 a mother of three , has since found religion and swapped bikinis for a head scarf talking about the interview , 34 - year - old @entity17 tells the @entity94 , ' it was very emotional to hear how @entity0 had felt so guilty about losing her virginity to this older man who had drugged and raped her , that she felt she had to marry him			1
' she was so young at the time , and she entered into an abusive marriage			0
the post-rape circumstances are very different for a rape victim than for any other crime			1
' we automatically try to minimize the impact of the abuse , which is something that is often not understood by police or society			0
a rape victim may not feel safe or able to report for a very long time			1
' the former model , who was attacked whilst working as a model in @entity110 , says it took guts for the @entity114 actress to speak out			2
' when @entity0 found out about the film , she decided she would help us			2
it ’s not something any of us want to do - to go on camera and talk about having been raped			1
' but when you know that speaking up can give others the courage to come forward and press charges , and how many others will be saved by putting a rapist in prison , you want to do it , ' says the mother of three			0
filmed over five years and directed by @entity130 , daughter of legendary actor @entity131 , the documentary , which shows @entity17 's meeting victims from @entity135 college students to young @entity136 living in poverty , received a standing ovation at its @entity140 premiere at @entity141 last week			1
@entity17 ( left ) and @entity14 director @entity142 , daughter of legendary actor @entity131 @entity17 , who has since found religion and swapped bikinis for a head scarf , says the documentary was one of the hardest things she 's ever done , but says she learnt so much from the experience			1
' it made me grateful to live in @entity16 , where i was able to convict my rapist			1
in @entity158 , in @entity155 and many other countries in the @entity157 , if a woman spoke out about sexual violence she would be treated like a criminal herself			0
those are the places where there is still so much to be done , ' she says			0
' but most rapes are committed by someone you know , in the family , in the workplace , in the community , in school , and this makes it very hard to speak up			0
' for @entity17 , the most powerful tonic during her ordeal was the support of her mother			1
' without my mum i could never have recovered			0
' she gave me support from the moment it happened			0
she never made me feel ashamed or that it was my fault			0
i wish every daughter who survives a rape or assault , has a mother like mine			2
' @entity17 's terrifying assault happened when she was 18 , six weeks before she was crowned @entity14			1
' i had just been through the worst thing in my life and i had not begun to recover , ' @entity17 says remembering the moment she was crowned			1
' i was in shock because i did n’t expect to win			0
a miss @entity16 had never won the crown			1
i did n’t think it was possible			0
' it all hit me at once when the crown was put on my head			0
i did n’t know what would become of me or what would happen , but i knew it was for a reason , and now i know : it ’s so that i can help other women not to stay silent			0
' the film shows @entity17 's meeting victims including @entity135 college students , young @entity136 living in poverty ( above ) as well as high profile women the trial of @entity17 's rapist took place during the year she was @entity14 , but throughout she refused to have her name or face concealed in media coverage , insisting that there was no reason to be ashamed			1
' it was a very hard time , ' she says			0
' my rapist ended up being convicting and sentenced to 16 years in prison			0
after the trial i spoke out and said to all the women in @entity16 should not to be afraid to report the crime if it happened to them			1
' then i was quiet for ten years			0
in 1998 , @entity223 ( the film 's producer ) encouraged me to make a film about my story and the stories of other women			1
' we went to @entity230 to find the right team , and we met our director , @entity142 and our producer and editor @entity233			0
' ' i wanted to encourage women not to stay silent , and not to blame themselves			0
i did n’t know how hard it would be , but i felt that it was my mission			0
' during the filming @entity17 suffered @entity238 , but was determined to complete the project , which inspired those working with her as well as the thousands others that will benefit from seeing the final product			1
director , @entity244 , says , ' @entity17 felt that she had recovered from the brutal rape crime , and was ready to reach out to other women			1
' @entity17 suffered ptsd during the filming but was determined to complete the project ' but traveling around the world and hearing the stories of other survivors triggered her own trauma over and over , and she began to suffer symptoms of @entity238 , ' she explains			1
' we never pushed her to continue , but her determination , in the face of how hard it was on her , was very motivating to all of us who worked on the film			2
' her transformation from teenage rape victim , beauty queen , and @entity16 super model ; into a religious mother , lawyer , and outspoken advocate on behalf of women around the world , was an epic , transformative narrative that unfolded over the five years we filmed with her			1
' @entity244 says the film 's website has become a focal point for victims to speak out			1
hundreds of thousands have visited the site , with many writing about the abuse they experienced and hundreds of emails arrive each day			0
for @entity17 , hearing from victims who are unable to seek justice has been the hardest part of the filming experience			1
' i 've been overwhelmed by how many women are suffering because they were n’t believed or given support , ' she says ' for myself , and so many women i spoke to , it ’s so important to seek help , whether it ’s from your family , a trusted friend , or a help line			0
some women do n't have access to justice , but you ca n’t heal if you keep it inside			0
