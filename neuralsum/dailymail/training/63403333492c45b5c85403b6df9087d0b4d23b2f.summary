by @entity0 @entity2 's involvement in the @entity4 final and @entity6 's tour to @entity7 continues to hang in the balance			1
the @entity10 captain has been sidelined for nearly two months with a shoulder injury and despite returning to training this week , is still restricted by a reduction in strength in the joint			1
saints will decide on friday morning whether he is ready to face @entity18 at @entity19 the following afternoon with director of rugby @entity20 insisting he is under consideration to start			1
will he , wo n't he ? @entity2 is doubtful for the @entity4 final and @entity6 's tour of @entity7 even if he fails to make @entity10 's matchday squad , there is still a chance he could fly to @entity7 with a view to participating in the second and third tests			1
' it 's touch and go whether he plays and whether we chance him , ' @entity20 said			2
' if he 's fit enough to be in the 23 and take part , the question is do you start him ? ' with his improvement there 's a very good chance he 'll be fit for @entity7			2
' ( @entity6 coach ) @entity38 has taken four hookers already , but if @entity2 is fit to tour then i do n't think he 'll have any hesitation taking him			1
and he 'll probably play			0
' @entity38 has said to me that if he plays for us , he 's definitely on the plane			2
' @entity44 said that if he does n't play for you , he 's not on the plane			0
' @entity20 admits @entity2 , who was sent off in last year 's @entity4 final for verbally abusing referee @entity48 , is " desperate " to face beaten @entity50 finalists @entity18 on saturday			1
' we know he 's an outstanding player and one of the best hookers around			0
we know what he does for the squad as well , ' @entity20 said			2
' but we have to balance knowing he could the job for us at the weekend , knowing he 'll be better than the other two we have got and also thinking about his health and whether he 's at risk by playing			0
' @entity2 is desperate to play and if you asked him he 'd say he 's fit			2
' chance to make amends ? @entity2 was sent off in last season 's @entity4 final @entity2 's fitness is of equally pressing concern to @entity6 , who are facing a crisis at hooker ahead of their series against the @entity7 which opens on saturday week			1
@entity71 is unable to tour for family reasons , denying @entity38 his second choice in the position , while next - in - line @entity75 is struggling with a knee problem			1
@entity79 's absence at tighthead prop due to a bulging disc in his neck requiring surgery and fresh fitness concerns over looseheads @entity85 , who has knee damage , and hip - injury victim @entity88 have decimated the front row options			2
@entity6 's most valued asset in the number one jersey is @entity92 , but the @entity93 and @entity94 only started his first game since october in friday 's @entity97 final victory over @entity98 was decided to give @entity92 the summer off , a decision strongly supported by @entity20			1
dropping like flies : @entity2 celebrates against @entity101 , but @entity6 are suffering a crisis in the hooker position ' on the face of it and from a physical , rugby point of view , @entity92 is fit to play and to tour , " @entity20 said			1
' but what we 're doing is right and when i say ' we ' i mean @entity38 , myself , @entity6 's medics and our medics			1
' we 're looking at the long - term for @entity92 and the best thing for him long - term is to have a holiday after this weekend			0
' he 'll come back to a reconditioning programme for him to make sure he 's in the best shape possible for next year leading into the @entity118			0
' @entity92 has had bad experiences with both knees			0
at the moment he has no pain and is running freely and is confident			0
' nobody would ever like to say it will never reoccur , but what we do know is that @entity92 needs to be managed for the rest of his career			0
' take a break : @entity92 has been given the summer off to recuperate from injury @entity10 are one victory away from a first @entity4 title and @entity20 outlined the impact being crowned @entity135 champions would have at @entity136			1
' we are a big club in a massive rugby area where rugby means so much			0
the whole town get behind us , ' he said			0
' we 've won a @entity50 which is a big achievement and if we won a @entity4 it would be huge and the effects would be massive			0

@entity2 is rated doubtful for @entity10 's @entity4 final
the @entity147 hooker could also miss @entity6 's tour of @entity7
@entity6 coach @entity38 and @entity10 director of rugby @entity20 will make the final decision
@entity6 are facing a crisis in the hooker position with @entity71 unable to tour and @entity75 struggling with injury
