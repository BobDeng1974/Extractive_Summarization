former @entity4 captain @entity7 revealed @entity8 hooker @entity0 has turned to sports psychologists in a bid to curb the temper that has jeopardised his international future			1
@entity0 's red card and three - match ban for elbowing @entity15 against @entity16 in december took his career suspensions to 50 weeks , adding to bans for eye - gouging , biting , punching and swearing			1

' i know @entity0 has been seeing a psychologist , i did the same in 2005 and it worked wonders for me , ' @entity7 said			2
' when you find the red mist descending , you distract yourself			0
' how do you do that ? for me , i ensured my first move in future would be to look at the referee , because my next action would be decided by him			0
@entity39 has turned to sports psychologists in a bid to curb the temper ' that simple process made sure that i never had another yellow or red card in my career , post- 2005			1
' the worrying thing for me is that @entity0 still keeps having these moments of red mist , and that will mean that teams will pick on him more and more			2
' @entity0 claimed he had no need for sports psychology after his red card in the 2013 @entity54 final for swearing at referee @entity55			2
the 28 - year - old was able to ride out head coach @entity57 warning he faced his ' last chance ' with @entity4 after that misdemeanour			1
@entity57 selected @entity0 in his @entity62 squad this week , shaking off suggestions the 61 - cap front - rower 's latest red card threatened his test future			1
@entity0 returned to action in @entity69 match against @entity70 last weekend @entity73 winner @entity7 , nicknamed ' @entity71 ' for his frenzied playing style , admitted he had to beat initial scepticism before benefiting from psychology in his own career			1
the former @entity16 and @entity78 flanker hopes @entity0 's decision to seek outside help is a positive move forward in the gritty hooker 's bid to curb his disciplinary wrangles			1
' there is a concern over his temperament in games , but that said , @entity0 is a very physical , competitive , combative forward who you always want in your team , ' said @entity7 , speaking on behalf of @entity92			2
' it 's just at what point does @entity57 say ' right , your behaviour is now costing the team '			2
@entity4 forward @entity7 ( left ) throws a punch at @entity27 's @entity25 in 2005 ' it is frustrating to watch and i 'm sure it 's frustrating to him that it keeps happening , so there 's got to be a way for him to deal with his emotion and to be able to control it			2
' i 'd hate for him to have any more incidents or his @entity4 career to be stopped short because of something he does			1
' i know @entity57 and the squad have been working very hard with him , and that he takes it very seriously			0
' the hardest thing for me actually was admitting that i needed to see a psychologist			0
@entity73 winner @entity7 was nicknamed ' @entity71 ' for his frenzied playing style ' i always thought it was my personal weakness that i could n't deal with my own mental issues			0
' there was a level of scepticism about it , but actually i came away realising it 's not a sign of weakness , it 's a sign of you wanting to be better			0
' sometimes you just need one simple distraction , you 've got to be able to deal with those emotions very quickly when something gets to you			0
' you need to have a trigger that distracts you - all of a sudden you 're back calm and cool and can make the right decision ' i was very proud to deal with it , it never stopped me playing the game with the same passion either			0
' and hopefully @entity0 can deal with it now too			0
' @entity7 is an ambassador for @entity92 , the official vehicle partner of @entity54 and a worldwide partner of @entity73 2015			0
