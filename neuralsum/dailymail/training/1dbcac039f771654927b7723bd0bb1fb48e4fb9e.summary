it may be more used to world leaders than beginner readers - but the @entity3 this week played host to a class of schoolkids and the cat in the hate thanks to @entity9			1
the @entity10 hosted a reception in the stately @entity12 of the presidential residence , and danced , jumped and did the limbo with an audience of 40 pupils from schools around @entity18 as well as bouncing up and down and hopping on one leg , the esteem visitors were also treated to a public rendition of the president 's new favorite reading material - a dr @entity26 - style guide to staying healthy as a kid			1
however , while most @entity26 tales are whimsical romps just meant to delight children , the latest product had the joint purpose of plugging the @entity10 's @entity61 initiative to fighting childhood obesity			2
entitled oh , the things you can do that are good for you , mrs @entity9 's book included government - approved public health advice , such as instructions for kids to exercise for an hour every day , remember to brush their teeth , and eat pumpkin seeds			1
working up a sweat : mrs @entity9 encouraged the children to run and dance during a 20 - minute presentation , which also included a reading from the new @entity26 tome listening : the versified public health pamphlet included advice for the young children , which mrs @entity9 later had them repeat back to her the @entity10 's reading , complete with big pictures and actions from a @entity84 brought in for the event , also covered how to sneeze properly and a reminder to wear a helmet when you cycle			0
one of the points made was mrs @entity9 's oft - repeated dictum that half of a meal should consist of fruit and vegetables , which was translated into @entity26 rhyming couplets			1
at one point @entity97 read : ' now it 's time to step up to my rainbow buffet , filled with colorful foods we should eat every day			2
' there are lots to choose from and their power is great - veggies and fruit should fill half of your plate			0
' after the rendition - which also included instruction to sleep 10 hours a day - mrs @entity9 had the children repeat her lessons back to her , before striking up a demonstration exercise session			0
children were told to stand up , jump around and pretend to ride their bicycle through their august surroundings			0
for a time , the children even struck up a limbo competition			0
they were later fed healthy snacks mentioned in the book by the @entity3 kitchen			1
the meeting was tied to the @entity10 's public health ambitions - which includes a commitment to eliminating child obesity within a generation .			0

first lady invited 40 pupils into the @entity3 's stately @entity12
read from new dr @entity134 about staying healthy
then led the kids in dancing , running and jumping to rhyming *guidelines*
