given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction , perhaps it is only appropriate that @entity3 should spend the eve of the masters on wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name			1
but it is not lookalike @entity10 who will carry the @entity13 's bag in the par - three tournament but keen golfer @entity15 as @entity3 looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career @entity19			1
@entity20 released their debut album in 2011 , the same year @entity3 won his first major , so you could say they have mirrored each other , hit for greatest hit			1
@entity3 watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 @entity28 @entity3 alongside his caddie @entity29 during the 2014 @entity30 in @entity31 @entity3 celebrates with his @entity29 on the 9th hole during the par 3 contest at @entity34 at last year 's masters , @entity3 piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee @entity29 donned the caddie 's famous white boiler suit			1
he might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time , for @entity20 are even more popular in the @entity41 than in @entity42			1
between them , @entity15 , an honorary member at @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity3 might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of ' old fogey ' initiatives			1
' we met in @entity52 at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to @entity28 , ' said @entity3			1
' i said if you 're available on the wednesday you 're more than welcome to carry the bag			2
' @entity15 will swap girls screams for @entity31 greens as he caddies for golfer @entity3 @entity3 hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 @entity28 @entity3 looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday , possibly because he knew what was coming			1
on the one hand , he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history			2
on the other , he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at @entity31			2
here is a sample : why is your record so bad on the par fives , @entity3 ? why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes ? why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card ? what the hell 's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee ? @entity3 walks over the @entity85 with caddie @entity86 during a practice round to be fair , he answered them all with politeness			1
after all , there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself			0
@entity3 knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes			1
he brought up the point raised in the @entity98 graphic from last saturday , which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner @entity102			2
' just look at the two par fives on the back nine on sunday , ' he said			0
' i had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and i walked off with two sixes			0
two fours i 'd have finished third			0
@entity3 waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 @entity28 ' it 's something i 've been thinking about a lot			1
look at @entity102 , who played them in eight - under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots			0
' i 've just been too aggressive at times			0
i had four sixes on par - fives last year , so if i can clean up those , i 'll have a chance to win			2
' as for those 77s , he said : ' it 's not like i 'm having a bad 18 holes			0
it 's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it 's usually on a friday , like last year			2
but i am better equipped now to handle it if things do n't go right way			0
mentally , i 'm in a far better place			0
' @entity3 conceded that the circus surrounding @entity136 's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well , too			1
the place you do not want to be come thursday is in one of the last two groups , like @entity136 , but @entity3 has been treated kindly , with a mid-morning threesome alongside @entity41 @entity143 and @entity144			1
' i do n't think i 've played alongside @entity143 at @entity31 so that 's perfect , ' he said			0
' we always get along well and he has a great record here			0
it will be fun to watch him			0
' it was this time last week , while practising in @entity151 , that @entity3 pronounced himself ready to go			1
' it 's been great not to have to think of anything technical while i 'm playing , ' he said			0
' i 've been able to enjoy the build - up			0
' @entity3 waits with his caddie @entity86 in the rain during a practice round at @entity34 asked who he saw as favourite , @entity3 went for @entity102 â€” ironic given a recent @entity160 survey among the pros ranked @entity102 as the least favourite			1
' i take it as i need to improve as a man , ' said @entity102 , with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place			0
as for @entity3 , he knows where he needs to improve			2
' you look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green , ' he said			0
after one direction on wednesday , it 'll be his turn to generate some roars .			2
