with its gentle drama and quaint childhood adventures , @entity3 painted a picture of wholesome family life in 19th century @entity6			1
set in the @entity8 - fearing town of @entity9 , @entity10 , plotlines rarely ventured beyond the realms of @entity12 and town gossip and real trouble meant somebody being late for dinner			1
but behind these tales of youthful innocence that brought fame to the town across the world , lurks a ghoulish story of real - life abduction and serial killing that author @entity25 neglected to mention			1
some 17 miles south of @entity9 , the township of @entity27 became the scene of a brutal campaign of murder by a family that became known as the @entity33			1
the family : @entity34 spoke with a gruff , guttural voice that was barely understandable while his wife was apparently so unfriendly that her neighbors took to calling her ' @entity38 ' the children : while their parents tended to keep themselves to themselves , @entity40 ( left ) and @entity41 ( right ) were known about the town of @entity27 and regularly attended sunday church			1
she also claimed to be psychic healer the family consisted of @entity48 , 60 , his wife @entity49 ( later referred to as @entity41 since no one knew her given name ) , 55 , son @entity40 and daughter @entity41			1
originally immigrants from @entity53 , @entity34 reportedly had such a gruff voice that , coupled with his strong foreign accent , him barely understandable while his wife was apparently so unfriendly that her neighbours took to calling her ' @entity38 '			2
while their parents tended to keep themselves to themselves , the children @entity40 , and @entity41 , both in their 20s , were known about the town and regularly attended sunday church			1
@entity41 also claimed to be psychic healer			0
television : the @entity62 ran from 1974 to 1983			0
set in the @entity8 - fearing town of @entity9 , @entity10 , plotlines rarely ventured beyond the realms of @entity12 and real trouble meant somebody being late for dinner the family , believed to have been of @entity70 or @entity71 origin , ran a bed and breakfast for travellers passing across the frontier			1
they lived in the back of their cabin			0
in the front , beginning in 1871 , they operated a small inn and store			1
it was there that they took to murdering and robbing at least a dozen travellers who stayed at the lodging between 1871 and 1873			1
so many disappearances were reported over that period that it is unclear exactly how many victims there actually were			1
@entity93 : this photograph from 1873 shows the graves found behind the @entity49 farm			1
it was noticed that the @entity33 ' garden was always freshly plowed but never planted more bodies : this is a stereographic photo shows a grave found under a trap door at the @entity49 house			1
around a dozen bodies were found , including various body parts it is believed their method was to smash their guests over the head with a hammer during dinner from behind a strategically - placed curtain before tipping their body through a trap door into a made - to - measure cellar			1
one of the women would then leap on the victim and cut their throat to seal their death			0
once in the cellar , they stripped the body , taking anything they could find of value , and later buried somewhere on the property , often in the orchard			1
it was noticed that the @entity33 â€™ garden was always freshly ploughed but never planted			0
suspicions were aroused and rumours spread within the village after a number of locals went missing but no official inquiries were made			0
it was not until dr @entity139 had vanished after setting out in search of neighbour @entity141 and his daughter who themselves had vanished after leaving @entity9 for a better life			1
neither mr @entity145 , his daughter , or dr @entity139 were ever found			0
dr @entity139 's brother , @entity10 state senator @entity148 , launched a hunt for his missing sibling but to no avail			1
on april 3 , colonel @entity152 returned to the inn with armed men after a woman fled the lodging claiming @entity158 had threatened her with knives			1
house of horror : the benders would smash their guests over the head with a hammer from behind a strategically - placed curtain before tipping their body through a trap door into a made - to - measure cellar @entity158 allegedly could not understand @entity171 while the younger benders denied the claim			1
when @entity152 repeated the allegation , @entity158 flew into a rage and branded the woman a witch who had cursed her coffee and ordered the men to leave her house			0
it was this outburst that revealed for the first time that ' her sense of the @entity171 language ' was much better than had been thought			0
before @entity152 left , @entity41 bid him to pay a second visit the next friday night when she promised to use her clairvoyant skills and contact the spirit world to help him find his missing brother			2
the men with @entity152 were convinced the @entity33 were guilty and wanted to hang them all but @entity139 insisted that evidence must be found			0
however , as suspicions strengthened and the finger of blame pointed stoutly towards the family			2
as more people vanished , a town meeting decided the perpetrators of the crimes had to be found and a search of every home in the area was authorised			2
@entity206 and his son both attended the meeting			0
then , within two weeks of the meeting a passer by noticed the @entity33 ' livestock had not been fed and it became clear the family had slipped into the night , never to be seen again			2
@entity214 : but behind tales of youthful innocence that brought fame to the area across the world , lurks a ghoulish story of real - life abduction and serial killing that author @entity25 failed to mention when the house was finally searched , their possessions were gone			1
what remained was a grim collection of more than a dozen bodies and various body parts buried in the property 's grounds			2
one was even discovered in the well			0
the first to be found was that of dr @entity139			0
he was buried face down with his feet barely below the surface among trees in the orchard			2
as more corpses were unearthed , the true tally of their murderous spree gradually became clear			0
all victims but one had been hit over the head and their throats cut			1
just the body of a young girl was found with no injuries sufficient to cause death			0
it was speculated that she had been strangled or buried alive alongside her mother			0
a state - wide manhunt was launched but the family was never found			1
their true identities have been the source of speculation ever since			0
in the weeks following the discovery , 12 men ' of bad repute in general ' were arrested , accused of disposing of the victims ' stolen goods			2
in @entity268 , 12 miles north of the @entity49 inn , inquiries revealed that four people fitting the @entity33 ' description had boarded a train for @entity273 , @entity10			1
the @entity273 station manager said that there the family split with @entity40 and @entity41 taking a train south , and @entity278 , carrying a doghide trunk ( possibly loaded with money ) , had taken a second train to @entity282			2
a team of lawmen managed to pick up the family 's trail as far as @entity287 and tailed them to @entity289 and into the @entity290			2
but they lost track in the end and were forced to give up and return home			0
in october 31 , 1889 , two women arrested for larceny in @entity297 , @entity298 , were identified as @entity158 and @entity33			0
they were brought back to @entity10			1
but after being held for two months they were released on grounds of insufficient evidence against them			0
there were various alleged sightings since but none led to any arrests			0
there have been suggestions that they joined a troupe of outlaws in @entity311 , others that they fled to the @entity313 , even to @entity53			2
in a speech at a book fair in a @entity317 department store in 1937 , @entity25 spoke of how the murders affected the community in which she lived			2
' the night of the day the bodies were found a neighbor rode up to our house and talked earnestly with @entity324 , ' she said			0
' @entity324 took his rifle down from its place over the door and said to @entity158 , " the vigilantes are called out			1
" ' then he saddled a horse and rode away with the neighbor			0
it was late the next day when he came back and he never told us where he had been			0
' for several years there was more or less a hunt for the benders and reports that they had been seen here or there			0
at such times @entity324 always said in a strange tone of finality , " they will never be found			0

@entity3 painted a picture of wholesome family life in 19th century @entity6 in the town of @entity9 , @entity10
