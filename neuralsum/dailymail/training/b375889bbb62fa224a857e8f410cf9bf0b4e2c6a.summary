a former paratrooper who witnessed the unlawful @entity2 killings is set to tell police investigating the shootings how he saw a @entity8 soldier ‘ lose the plot ’ and fire indiscriminately in a residential area			1
the retired @entity10 , who is to be interviewed as part of a criminal inquiry into the deaths of 14 civil rights protesters , will describe how a soldier rattled off 20 rounds as he fired from the hip towards a block of flats before being ordered to ‘ cease fire ’			1
the @entity21 , who can not be named for security reasons , will be among the first @entity2 veterans to provide testimony as part of a criminal investigation into the events of january 30 , 1972			2
the interview will take place next month at a secret location in @entity8			1
the anonymous former member of the @entity10 said he saw soldiers ' shooting from the hip ' but only after they were fired upon by the @entity35 the investigation by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) has been widely criticised as politically motivated and against the public interest			1
it comes four years after the £ 250 million @entity40 into @entity2 produced its findings			0
following the report , the decision whether to prosecute any individual soldier was left to the @entity46 soldiers now facing questions have long since retired and are in their 60s and 70s			2
the investigation comes after it emerged that convicted @entity35 terrorists received @entity52 pardons and letters from the government assuring them that they will not face further legal action			1
up to 200 former soldiers face being formally questioned by police for alleged murder , attempted murder or criminal injury			0
a @entity8 solider detains a protester during the civil rights march where 14 unarmed civilians were shot dead the @entity21 told last night how two or three soldiers ‘ lost the plot ’ on the day , but he insisted that troops reacted only after @entity35 members fired sub-machine guns at them first			1
he said : ‘ i will give the police an entirely unbiased account of what i saw , including the incident of the soldier rattling off 20 rounds from his magazine towards a block of flats			1
fortunately nobody was injured or killed by his actions			0
‘ i will tell the police how , before any @entity8 soldiers opened fire , the @entity35 fired at us and that , unquestionably , there was a genuine threat to our lives			1
lord @entity89 ’s report painted an unfair picture of the @entity10 because the conclusions were so dismissive of the active role played by the @entity35 that day			1
they were firing @entity94 sub-machine guns			0
’ the @entity95 has agreed to meet @entity37 officers next month			2
fearful that his identity could be leaked to @entity100 terrorists , the veteran has insisted that police officers do not visit him at his home			0
the un-named former @entity10 said he saw one soldier ' rattling off 20 rounds ' towards a block of flats ' shooting indiscriminately ' he said @entity37 detectives have indicated that they are ‘ looking for prosecutions ’			1
but in building cases against @entity8 soldiers they can not use evidence given to the @entity40 – because its aim was not to accuse individuals or institutions such as the @entity115			2
instead , the @entity37 must obtain fresh witness statements from soldiers who were present that @entity119 year the @entity118 began hiring lawyers to represent @entity10 interviewed under caution or charged with criminal offences			2
paras who engaged with protesters could be found guilty of murder based on the evidence of anonymous witnesses			0
it will be left up to courts to decide whether witnesses such as the veteran who spoke to @entity132 can remain anonymous			0
the @entity37 was unavailable for comment			0
the @entity118 said : ‘ it is for the @entity37 to decide whether to look into these allegations			0
if they do , we will support them fully with their investigation			0

former @entity10 claims one soldier ' rattled off 20 rounds ' at a flat *complex*
he will tell investigators that the @entity35 opened fire at troops first
the interview will take place next month at a secret location in @entity8
