@entity1 , a pupil at the @entity2 in @entity3 , had been kidnapped more than a week ago by an electrician hired by his father , a jeweler , to work on his house			2
@entity16 , 37 , spent 11 days masterminding a plan to kidnap the boy in return for ransom , painstakingly plotting the family 's movements from a secret vantage point that overlooked their home			1
but the plan went awry when he phoned the boy 's parents to demand 5,000,000 rupees ( Â£ 50,000 ) ... only to find they were already reporting their son 's disappearance to police			0
rather than give himself up and release the boy , @entity32 ordered his accomplices to strangle him instead and chop the body into pieces with an electric saw			1
they then scattered the boy 's body parts about @entity42 flower market in @entity43 , near @entity3			0
all five men now face the death penalty after they were arrested and charged with kidnap and murder			1
the abduction took place at around 11am on april 17 , when @entity16 arrived on a motorbike at the housing complex in which the @entity52 lived telling @entity1 his father wanted to see him at his shop			1
he already knew the boy would be home alone because he had been charting the family 's movements for over a week			0
@entity57 later captured @entity16 driving out of the complex with @entity1 riding pillion			1
about two hours later , the two stepped into a sports shop , police said , where @entity16 bought a cricket bat for @entity64 , 400 and told @entity1 to check it outside , where his four accomplices lay in wait			1
gruesome : rather than give himself up and release the boy , @entity32 ordered his accomplices to strangle @entity71 instead and chop the body into pieces with an electric saw			2
they hid his body parts around the @entity42 flower market in @entity43 , near @entity3 callous : the @entity78 flower market is a bustling hub of local trade they grabbed the boy , bundled him into a van and drove away			0
but the kidnapper had not expected @entity1 's parents to go straight to the police when their son did not return home			2
tragically , by the time @entity16 made the ransom call , @entity90 and mrs @entity91 were already at the police station			2
@entity16 learned that he was being hunted by detectives when the parents returned home , overhearing a conversation from his spy position			0
so , that same night , he arranged for the boy to be killed			0
his body parts had been scattered about several locations , all near the flower market			0
the parts were then recovered after @entity16 made a full confession			0
police said the electrician turned killer was driven by greed and plotted his crime over 11 days , carefully plotting the movements of the boy and his family			1
it was @entity16 who had told the boy he was wanted at his father 's shop , and kidnapped him on the way , they said .			0

@entity1 was strangled and chopped to pieces with an electric saw
@entity16 , 37 , and 4 accomplices now face the death penalty
