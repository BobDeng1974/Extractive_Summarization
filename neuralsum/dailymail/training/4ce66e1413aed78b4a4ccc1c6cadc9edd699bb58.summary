it is a slow and uncertain process of return ... @entity0 is responding positively to the process , started this week			2
' in the case of traumatic brain injury , such as that sustained by @entity0 , doctors sometimes induce a coma			2
shutting down function can give the brain time to heal			0
to end the coma the dosage of powerful aneasthetic drugs being administered is gradually reduced			0
@entity0 ’s spokeswoman @entity52 reiterated that speculation about his condition should be ignored			0
in a statement she said : ' i insist again on the fact that any statement on the health of @entity0 that does not come from the medical team in charge or his management is just speculation			2
' seven - time world champion @entity0 , 45 , has been receiving round - the - clock care in @entity64 since december 29 when he hit his head on a rock while skiing off - piste in @entity68 , in the @entity69			1

thank you all so much ... we all know he is a fighter and will not give up			0
' yesterday it was revealed that @entity0 is being given muscle training in order to stop his muscles from withering away			1
the @entity7 star is receiving muscle therapy so that his body will not seize up as he stays sedated in intensive care in @entity64 following his ski accident four weeks ago			1
he was placed into an artificially induced coma shortly after the crash , but such measures normally last only a maximum of two weeks			2
' patients in comas need limbs and joints moved daily to ensure muscles do not atrophy , ' emergency medicine expert professor @entity115 told @entity121 one @entity123 website reported @entity0 , 45 , may suffer from @entity124 or persistent vegetative state			1
@entity127 - @entity126 , professor of neurology at the @entity129 , said : ' every day , every week in a coma the chances decline that the situation is improving '			1
probe : investigators at the site of @entity0 's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off - piste in @entity68 , @entity4 the the support of his wife @entity143 , 44 , his two teenaged children , brother and closest friends can not mask the fact that more than four weeks in an artificial coma means that he is far from anywhere near recovery			1
a persistent vegetative state is one in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness			0
this means that if doctors do bring him out of his artificially induced coma he would be unable to speak , move or feed himself			2
the format.at news website said ; ' more than three weeks after the tragic skiing accident of the seven - time @entity160 champion @entity0 , hope dwindle for a full recovery			1
' for more than three weeks now @entity0 lies in a medically induced coma at the @entity164 in @entity64			1
get well soon ! @entity166 and @entity167 stars hold out a banner wishing @entity0 good health @entity124 - or persistent vegetative state - occurs when a patient with severe brain damage remains in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness after waking from a coma			1

the chance of recovery from @entity124 are far below 50 per cent			0
there is no treatment , but a person can live for many years with the right medical care			0
he is fed there with probes , washed daily and moved again and again to avoid a bed sores			0
' it goes on to speculate that the ' severe damage ' he suffered to his brain in a ski accident on december 29 could result in the permanent vegative state suffered by around 10,000 of his @entity8 countrymen			0
this would mean , if and when he is brought out of the coma by his medical team , ' that his condition would hardly be different from the medically induced coma '			1
@entity124 is always the result of a severe brain injury			0
the chance of recovery from @entity124 are far below 50 per cent			0
' @entity0 's condition remains stable but there is a firewall of silence from his medical team about the intense battle being waged to try to bring him back to normality			2
brain injury patients are placed into artificial comas to reduce the amount of oxygen that flows into the brain , thus making it work less and giving it time to heal			0
such comas usually last for a maximum of two weeks , although there have been instances of patients being under longer			0
as @entity0 enters his fourth week in such a state neurological experts are starting to doubt whether he might ever recover sufficiently to be brought out of his sleep			2

players from both sides held up a banner which read ‘ @entity236 ! you can do it , @entity0 ’ prior to their friendly on saturday in honour of the 45 - year - old @entity8 , who is a @entity166 supporter			2
