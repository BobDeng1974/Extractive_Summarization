fresh from his tirade in the @entity3 about how much he hates media scrutiny by @entity6 reporter published : 10:18 est , 26 february 2014 @entity8 : 21:49 est , 26 february 2014 hypocrite ? @entity9 will play a journalist in an episode of @entity12 : @entity13 airing march 19 ; despite his rants against the media media - loathing @entity9 accepted the role of a journalist in an episode of the hit series , @entity12 : @entity13			1
the actor , 55 , who just days ago ranted in @entity3 about how much he hates the media , portrays a newspaper columnist on the show which airs on @entity25 ; the network that hosted his hit show @entity28 and has felt the rough end of the @entity9 tongue frequently			1
@entity9 will play @entity31 , ' who questions the svu squad ’s motives ' during the investigation hate crime - rape investigation , according to @entity25			1
criminal stories will be shown on march 19 ; directed by the series ' star @entity37			2
the brunette remarked upon @entity9 ’s ' fierce commitment			1
' @entity9 's @entity42 chat show was axed in november after he allegedly called a photographer outside his @entity45 home ' a c * * ks * king f * g ' , though he insists he called him a ' c * ks * ker			1
' in @entity3 , @entity9 said former @entity42 colleague @entity51 ' neither eloquent nor funny ' and described host @entity52 as ' a phony who does n’t have the same passion for the truth off - camera that she seems to have on the air			1
' he also laid into @entity61 ’s @entity60 as ' the self - appointed @entity62 of gay media culture , ' name - checking the late head of the @entity65			2
' i give up ' : melodramatic @entity9 laments his a-list life as he predicts he will ' probably ' have to leave @entity68 due to media scrutiny but oddly suggests a move to @entity71 ; @entity73 's showbiz media hub revealing : the interview also detail the former 30 @entity76 's feud with fellow actor @entity77 and the dispute with @entity42 that ended his short - lived up late talk show in the same interview , mr @entity9 also claims @entity77 verbally attacked him while making orphans , leading to their bust - up			1
the star and mr @entity77 were engulfed in a feud after clashing while making the @entity85 play partly because he claims the @entity87 actor ' began to sulk ' because mr @entity9 did n't learn his lines ahead of rehearsals			1
he said : ' one day he attacked me in front of everyone			2
he said , “ you ’re slowing me down , and you do n’t know your lines			2
and if you do n’t say your lines , i ’m just going to keep saying my lines			2
” ' we all sat , frozen			2
i snorted a bit , and , turning to him in front of the whole cast , i asked , “ if i do n’t say my words fast enough , you ’re going to just say your next line ? ” i said			2
“ you realise the lines are written in a certain order ? ” he just glared at me			0
' mr @entity9 claims he asked for a break to cut short the incident and went to speak to the stage manager with director @entity109 and offered to quit the project and insisted they did n't fire mr @entity77			1
but the actor recalls mr @entity77 , who he had heard was ' potentially very difficult to work with ' , was ' shocked ' when he was given his marching orders from the show			2
love - hate relationship : the volatile star has long lamented the intrusion into his private life and several homophobic rants have notably affected his career , with his short - lived up late talk show cancelled in november following an anti-gay slur at a photographer getting to it : while @entity9 claims he wants to move he seemed quite happy to be in @entity68 with his wife @entity125 on wednesday elsewhere in the article , which features an accompanying close - up of mr @entity9 as he stares into the camera with a neutral , if a little sour , expression on his face , the oscar - nominee discusses his feelings about @entity42 , on which he had short - lived talk show up late			1
the programme was pulled off air for good in november after five episodes following what was initially a two - week suspension			0
while the official word was that the two parted ways mutually , sources say the star 's ' diva - like behaviour towards co-workers ' , along with the homophobic comment , played a deciding factor in the decision			0
but in his @entity3 chat , he insists he ' never wanted ' to be on @entity42 in the first place and describes it as ' the same s * * t all day long ' as well as slamming several stars of the channel including talk show host @entity51			1
leading the way : the star made a bee line for his car as @entity125 was a few steps behind all bundled up : the mother - of - one looked to be in a relaxed mood on the outing speaking about the channel , he said : ' @entity166 was boring			0
@entity167 is neither eloquent nor funny			0
and merely cranky does n’t always work well in the morning			0
@entity168 is the @entity169 of cable news			0
i liked @entity171 a lot			0
i like @entity173 , but he ’s too smart to be doing that show			0
@entity52 is @entity52 , the ultimate wonk / dweeb who got a show , polished it , made it her own			0
the problem with everybody on @entity42 is none of them are funny , although that does n’t prevent them from trying to be			1
' however , ms @entity52 - who he described as ' phony who does n't have the same passion for truth off - camera that she seems to have on air - seems to have dismissed his claims , highlighting that they have never even met			0
she tweeted : ' i have never met mr. @entity9 , either on - camera or off - camera			1
i wish him all the best			0
' around the same time the @entity198 talk show was pulled , @entity9 lamented the invasion of privacy he and his family faces on a daily basis , ranting in an open letter on the @entity204 that he was willing to give it all up to protect his loved ones			1
' if quitting the television business , the movie business , the theater , any component of entertainment , is necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family , then that is an easy choice , ' he wrote			0
' this country ’s obsession with the private lives of famous people is tragic			0
' ' it is an easy choice ' : in november , the former @entity28 actor said it was a no - brainer that he would give up his career for the sake of protecting his family - pictured here with wife @entity228 and six - month - old daughter @entity229 in @entity230 earlier this month			0
