' when asked if @entity3 's new style could also help convince @entity2 to stay @entity0 added : ' everyone is enjoying the way we 're playing at the moment			1
we can keep going and keep improving			0
' i think at the start of the season we did n't have as much of the ball and we were defending for most of the games but in the last five games we 've had more possession than the other teams and i think everyone 's enjoying playing out from the back and we 're all comfortable doing it			0
