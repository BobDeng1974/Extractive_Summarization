@entity1 's central defensive duo have vowed they are ready to do what @entity3 could n’t and stop @entity6 ’s rampant goal - machine led by the fearsome @entity7			1
the @entity9 striker laid on the second goal for @entity11 in a shock 2 - 0 win over the world champions in @entity15 on saturday night as the @entity16 sank to their first qualifying defeat since october 2007			1
the free - scoring @entity18 now top @entity19 on goal difference from @entity21 with a 100 - per - cent record from two games , scoring nine and conceding none			1
@entity1 will have to do better than @entity3 at keeping the likes of @entity6 's @entity7 ( @entity26 ) quiet @entity28 midfielder @entity27 scored the match winner in @entity1 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity31 but @entity1 centre back @entity32 insists @entity33 hold no fears			1
and his defensive partner , @entity35 , is also confident @entity37 ’s @entity36 can handle what is thrown at them in the @entity18 capital on tuesday night			1
after @entity1 ’s 1 - 0 win over @entity31 on saturday , @entity32 said : ‘ @entity7 is one of the best in the world in his position – but it ’s up to us to nullify his threat			1
‘ and i ’ve competed week in week out against guys of his quality in the @entity49 so i know what ’s coming			0
‘ @entity51 was the toughest - he is just a brilliant player			0
and with @entity1 we kept a clean sheet against @entity54 and @entity55			2
i ’ve also played against @entity56 of @entity57 and @entity3 have good players too			2
@entity1 defender @entity32 ( @entity26 ) and @entity59 ( r ) celebrate @entity27 's winner @entity1 will also have to contend with substitute @entity11 who scored the second goal in @entity15 ‘ @entity35 and myself are both desperate to get back to the @entity49 as soon as possible and tests like these against @entity6 and @entity7 are tests you need to pass			1
we need to prove we are still ready for it , that we can compete at that level			0
‘ i ’ve not seen as much of @entity7 as the others strikers ( in the @entity49 ) because he plays in @entity3 but the staff will make sure we see all about him before the game			2
there will be no excuses			0
‘ but @entity7 ’s not @entity6 ’s only threat – and it ’s going to be a team effort to stop him			1
but we will be ready			0
and we go there confident after getting a clean sheet against @entity31			0
’ @entity76 captain @entity35 ( r ) claims @entity1 have a game plan to deal with the @entity18 @entity6 lead @entity19 while @entity1 are surprisingly ahead of @entity79 winners @entity3 on goal difference @entity35 also welcomes the challenge in @entity15 after shutting out the @entity82 at @entity83			1
the @entity76 skipper also takes confidence from @entity1 winning a friendly 1 - 0 out in @entity6 in march , thanks to a @entity88 goal , even though he and @entity7 were both missing that night			1
‘ we know @entity6 have got the big name in their team but we are going there with a game plan , ’ said the 22 - year - old			2
‘ and , hopefully , we ’ll get something out of the game			0
‘ of course , playing against @entity7 will be difficult but we ’re confident we can handle it			2
we ’ll give them the respect that they ’re due but we ’ ve got to remember that we coped with @entity55			0
it ’s going to be a test , though			0
‘ we ’d be happy if @entity104 does n’t have a save to make in @entity6 ( like against @entity31 ) but we know it will be a different game out there			0
@entity1 defeated @entity6 1 - 0 in friendly in march courtesy of a goal from @entity110 captain @entity88 ‘ i would n’t like to say whether a draw would be a good result over there but , with the confidence we have now , we ’ve got to go into it looking to produce another performance like this one and then who knows what might happen ? ‘ i was n’t involved when we won in @entity6 in march but that result has given the boys belief			1
we have players who can make an impact and , with a wee bit of luck , i do n’t think we ’ll be far away			0
‘ there ’s no reason for us to be afraid of them because we ’re playing with no fear			0
