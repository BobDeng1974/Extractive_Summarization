a new type of ' legal high ' could be developed into a drug that can help to stop people from binge drinking while still giving them a buzz			1
the inventor , who was also behind the banned substance mephedrone , has filed a patent application for the substance through a dutch charity			2
the drug , known as @entity12 , gives users a feeling of intoxication similar to the party drug ecstasy while limiting the amount of alcohol they drink			1
around one in ten deaths in working age adults are due to excessive alcohol use and it accounts for 3.3 million deaths a year worldwide			0
journalist @entity36 is among the few to have tried the potential chaperon drug @entity12			1
despite the risks of taking an unlicensed and untested drug , he decided to try 5 - methoxy - 2 - aminoindane after asking scientists to conduct a few toxicity tests			0
during a night out drinking with friends he took a small dose and then began drinking two hours later , slowly upping his dose of @entity12 as he did			1
after four hours he said he began to feel a relaxed high			0
more than five hours after the first does , he said he felt ' intense but controlled euphoria '			0
writing for @entity48 he said that at that stage ' the idea of drinking alcohol seems repuslive - as does eating bar food '			1
he said : ' my friends later described my behaviour as rational , if a little tense			0
' the drug did n't stop me from sleeping and i had no anxiety or depression in the following days			0
so it seems like a party drug without some of the side effects			1
' my experience is not a scientific study			2
it took a lot of the drug to make me want to stop drinking and by then i felt both drunk and high			2
' professor @entity69 , a psychopharmacologist at @entity25 and a former @entity71 drugs adviser , now believes @entity28 drugs that reduce the desire to drink may provide a way of tackling the problem			1
he believes @entity12 is a potential ' binge mitigator ' that could be taken at the start of a night out to kick in after a couple of hours to remove the users desire to drink anymore while still giving them a pleasurable feeling that makes people want to drink in the first place			1
the drug 's designer , a mathematician known by his pseudonym dr z , has agreed to gift the patent to professor @entity69 's charitable research group @entity89 , to help fund research on @entity92			1
professor @entity69 told @entity93 : ' @entity94 recently signed off on a drug called @entity96 for use by alcoholics as it stops the loss of self control they suffer from			1
' that got us thinking about another way to approach the problem which would be to take away people 's desire to drink			0
' what tends to happen is that people go out for just a couple of pints but after having them something changes in their brain and they then end up drinking far more than they intended , causing them to end up in trouble			2
' we are looking for ways to stop this switch from flipping in the first place			0
we are looking at around 80 substances and @entity12 is one of those			2
' many of the potential chaperon substances being investigated by @entity69 were previously patented as drugs to treat other conditions such as depression but failed to ever make it to market			1
he said they were now hoping to repurpose these compounds for other uses			0
professor @entity69 and his @entity89 charity is looking at 80 substances that could potentially be used as ' @entity133 ' drugs that revellers can take during a night out to reduce their risk of binge drinking @entity12 was developed by dr z ( pictured ) , the drug designer behind several legal highs including mephedrone @entity141 was sold over the internet as plant food before it was banned after being linked to several deaths so far around 40 people , including its inventor dr z , have tried @entity12 but no laboratory tests or clinical trials have been carried out			1
one person said they did not enjoy the experience while others have said it made them feel euphoric			0
some have reported losing the desire to drink within around two hours of taking the substance			0
one journalist for @entity48 who has tried @entity12 said it took five hours before drinking alcohol became ' repulsive ' also called 5 - methoxy - 2 - aminoindane , @entity12 is a ring shaped compound known as an aminoindane			1
it is structurally similar to two other ' legal highs ' invented by dr @entity165 from @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 - that mimic the euphoric effects of ecstasy			2
binge drinking is a major problem in many cities at weekends but it can also lead to long term illnesses however , @entity12 also looks like another drug , @entity177 , which is known to be highly toxic			1
in neurotransmitters , just a small change to the structure and chemical groups on a compound can produce dramatic differences in how they work			0
currently drug laws in @entity185 and @entity186 only ban the use and sale of specific substances			0
this means new compounds developed by chemists can be sold without fear of prosecution until they are added to the list of controlled substances			0
in many cases , production of these new drugs is currently outstripping the ability of the authorities to keep up by making them illegal			0
the growing problem of legal highs came to the public 's attention following a series of deaths among users			2
taking a chaperon drug similar to @entity12 at the start of a night out could stop people from drinking too much @entity141 , created by dr z and sold over the internet as plant food , caused at least one death and has been implicated in at least 13 others			1
however , there are some who believe these new substances could provide new forms of treatment if tested properly			0
professor @entity69 said he hopes to conduct scientific tests on chaperons in animals before attempting clinical trials to see if it could be useful			1
' we are hoping to do testing in animal models and build up to clinical trials , ' said professor @entity69			1
' however , all of this costs a lot of money and we need to raise funding for it , which is what we are hoping the @entity12 patent will help with			2
' speaking to @entity48 , he added : ' we have to see this as an opportunity to reduce harms rather than a new drug that has hit the market			0
' however , dr @entity247 warned that it was difficult to predict how drugs like @entity12 would behave in the brain and whether they might also do more harm than good			2
he told @entity48 : ' there really is no good way to predict biological activity in a completely novel structure			0

the drug , called @entity12 , was developed by the inventor of mephedrone
former government adviser professor @entity69 hopes to study the drug
users say @entity12 makes drinking alcohol ' repulsive ' within a couple of hours
the drug also gives a euphoric feeling similar to the party drug ecstasy
professor @entity69 believes it could be used to create a ' @entity28 drug ' to help tackle the problem of binge drinking that *blights* many towns and cities
scientific testing and clinical trials on chaperon has still to be conducted
