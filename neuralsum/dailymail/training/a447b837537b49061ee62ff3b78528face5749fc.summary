@entity0 has warned @entity1 their problems run deeper than @entity3 as he looks to guide @entity4 to the @entity6 knockout stage			1
@entity1 arrive here in the @entity9 capital on monday with the unenviable task of trying to halt @entity4 's juggernaut			1
the reigning @entity6 holders have won their last 11 games and extending that sequence to a 12th match would take them through to the last 16			1
by contrast , @entity17 ’ side have floundered and suffered another confidence - draining defeat at the weekend , losing 1 - 0 to @entity21			2
during their struggles , @entity3 has attracted much scrutiny and @entity0 was asked for his view at @entity4 ’s @entity27 training complex			1
@entity4 boss @entity0 ( centre ) believes @entity1 's problems run deeper than @entity3 's scoring drought @entity0 also cites the loss of @entity32 to @entity33 as another reason for @entity1 's struggles compared with last year @entity3 has failed to break his @entity36 scoring duck for @entity1 since his £ 16m summer switch from @entity39 @entity4 , with @entity40 ( centre ) and co training on monday , go into tuesday 's clash looking for a 12th straight win in all competitions the @entity4 boss believes @entity1 have n't found a system to adapt to @entity3 's skills too victory for defender @entity50 ( 2nd right ) and his team - mates would see them progress through to the last 16 of the @entity6 the @entity4 squad were put through their paces by @entity0 during monday 's session at the club 's @entity27 training complex @entity0 ’s answer was significant			1
@entity3 might be the focus because he has failed to score a @entity36 goal but @entity4 ’s head coach was quick to point out that is not the only conundrum @entity17 is trying to work out			1
he feels criticism of 24 - year - old @entity3 is unfair			1
‘ @entity3 is spoken of a lot , maybe too much , ’ said @entity0 , who expects to unleash @entity65 against @entity1 now that the world ’s most expensive player has recovered from a thigh injury			1
‘ he has quality and is at a side where they are not playing well			0
‘ they have lost @entity32 who scored a lot and they need another solution			1
but i do n’t think all of @entity79 ’s problems are about @entity3			2
he needs to do his work for the side , that ’s all that can be asked of him			0
the coach needs to find the right system with the new players			2
’ of @entity65 , @entity0 added : ‘ @entity65 is ready to play and is back from injury and i do n’t know if he will play from the off or on the bench			2
’ @entity4 have been bolstered by the return of @entity65 ( left ) from a back injury ahead of tuesday 's match @entity0 ( right ) admitted he is unsure whether or not @entity65 ( left ) will start against @entity1 there is a chance history could be made in tuesday ’s game as @entity97 needs only two goals to usurp another @entity4 legend , @entity99 , as the all - time @entity6 top scorer and , given his staggering form , few would bet against him			1
the way @entity97 has been playing , it could be suggested he is worth a one - goal start to @entity4 and @entity0 admitted he is finding it difficult to talk about the @entity107 international , as he has bestowed so many compliments upon him			1
‘ i have to speak about @entity97 a lot , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ the last time i said it ’s hard to find a new word to describe him			0
what can i say ? he ’s a fantastic player and professional and that ’s it			0
he is working hard for himself and the side , just like other players such as ( @entity120 ) @entity119 and @entity121 ( @entity122 )			0
‘ he is a team player			0
he will pass to players in better positions if they have a better chance to score than him			0
we have been on a good run and that helps us			0
i do n’t think he ’s thinking about the record			0
he has time , it ’s not his last game , he is focused on playing for the team			0
@entity97 ( centre ) is expected to start in attack for @entity4 in tuesday 's @entity6 clash @entity97 ( centre ) is two goals away from breaking @entity99 's record as the all - time @entity6 top scorer the @entity107 international ( centre ) has been in scintillating form for @entity4 and has left @entity0 running out of superlatives @entity1 will face familiar foes in former @entity36 stars @entity65 ( left ) , @entity145 and @entity97 ( right ) on tuesday there was , however , an ominous message for @entity1			1
‘ we have a serious side , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i do n’t think that we will lose			0
’ @entity0 , meanwhile , has brushed off talk about his own future			2
he has a year and a half left on his contract but , even though he has won three trophies since he arrived from @entity155 , insists there is no hurry to enter discussions			0
‘ there ’s time to talk about this ( new contract )			0
i have 18 months left and there ’s no rush , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ we will be fine			0
