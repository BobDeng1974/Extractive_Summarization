with its 12th - century church , clutch of newsagents and parade of high - street shops , the town of @entity1 , @entity2 , is a rather unlikely setting for a treasure hunt			1
but almost everyone here is taking part in a desperate quest for loot , leaving no stone — or sofa cushion — unturned			2
for today is d - day : the 180th day since someone in the area bought a winning @entity21 ticket			1
the owner of the £ 2 ticket stands to win almost £ 64 million — but has until just 11pm tonight to claim their jackpot			1
wealthy : the winner of the £ 64million jackpot would find themselves suddenly richer than @entity1 's most famous sons @entity31 star @entity31 , left , and @entity33 star @entity32 if the ticket is n’t found in time , every penny of the £ 63,837,543.460 ( not to mention the £ 645,000 interest that the prize money has already accrued ) will go to the @entity39 fund to be distributed to charities around the country			1
should the winning ticket remain elusive , it will represent the largest unclaimed prize in @entity45 lottery history			1
no wonder everyone who has ever bought a lottery ticket in @entity1 and nearby @entity48 is frantically checking their coat pockets , rifling through their car ’s glove compartment and ransacking the kitchen drawers			1
posters with ‘ are you missing £ 63.8 million ? ’ in a big black and yellow font are plastered to shop windows			1
‘ it ’s non-stop , ’ says @entity58 , who runs the @entity60 news - agent on @entity61 with her husband @entity62			0
there , more than 1,000 lottery tickets are sold each week			0
‘ everybody ’s been checking their ticket to see if they won , ’ says @entity58			1
‘ we ’ve had people come in and try to claim with other tickets — all sorts of combinations			1
‘ there have been tickets dating back months but none with the right combination of numbers			0
‘ one customer employed a cleaner especially to sweep through her house and see if it was under a sofa anywhere — but it was n’t			0
imagine losing such a valuable ticket ! ’ winner : past @entity1 lottery winners include @entity90 pictured celebrating with her son @entity91 at @entity92 in 2005 the prize money would allow the winner to buy 339 houses at the average @entity1 price of £ 190,000 or — should the urge take them — more than two million bottles of champagne			1
it would also make them a good deal richer than the commuter town ’s most glamorous son , @entity33 driver @entity32 ( who is worth a reported £ 55 million ) , and almost three times wealthier than local @entity109 star @entity31 ( worth a relatively paltry £ 24 million )			0
ever since the winning numbers were announced on june 8 , @entity110 has been urging locals to find and check any tickets they may have forgotten about or lost			1
vans bearing the slogan ‘ it could be you ’ have been driven around town			0
leafleteers have been stationed on the @entity61			0
they even erected a giant sofa a few weeks ago to encourage residents to look under their cushions			0
theories as to what could have happened to the ticket abound			2
a popular one is that the owner lost it after a few too many at the local @entity129 pub. ‘ i ’ve had punters come in and ask if i ’ve seen anything lying around , ’ says barman @entity130			0
‘ one guy bought a ticket then went out that night , before going on holiday			1
when he came back he was moving house and could n’t find his ticket , so he thought it could be here			2
’ another theory is that the winner has moved abroad — or even died			2
far more likely is that the ticket has simply been misplaced or thrown away by mistake			2
@entity110 deals with countless claims from people who ’ve lost their ticket			2
in 2001 @entity149 , a purchasing manager from @entity150 , missed out on a jackpot of £ 3,011,065 after losing his ticket			1
using computer records , he was able to prove the winning ticket was his but @entity110 refused to pay out — since the rules state that the winner must have their ticket to claim their fortune			1
the decision sparked a national furore , with even the then prime minister @entity159 championing mr @entity149 ’s cause — but all in vain			0
despite three lengthy court cases against @entity110 he ended up without a penny			0
loser : @entity149 , from @entity150 , missed out on a £ 3million jackpot when he did n't claim a lottery win in time in 2004 , £ 7 million went unclaimed in @entity168 , and in september 2007 a £ 6.9 million win was n’t claimed in @entity170			1
so far , the largest unclaimed sum is £ 9.4 million , on a ticket that was bought in @entity173 in july 2005			1
@entity110 ’s @entity174 says : ‘ we all want winners to get their money but there must be a deadline			2
otherwise every prize would just go on indefinitely			2
but this way billions of pounds have gone to good causes over the years — from funding the @entity183 through bodies like @entity185 to local playgroups and @entity188 clubs			0
’ still , the psychological fallout of a near miss can be devastating			0
after mr @entity149 was denied his millions he plunged into depression , separated from his partner and moved to @entity194 , where he joined an evangelical cult			0
he has since returned and , claiming to have found happiness , written a book about his ordeal			0
residents in @entity1 can readily imagine the pain of losing a winning ticket			1
@entity202 , 56 , a human resources manager , says : ‘ can you imagine ? it would be awful			0
it ’s money that could completely change your life			0
if that were me , i ’d feel sick			0
’ not to mention more than a little bit silly			0
after all , how could anyone misplace a piece of paper that could change their lives so dramatically ? ‘ they do n’t deserve to win if you ask me , ’ puffs 75 - year - old retired telecoms engineer @entity215			0
‘ who plays the lottery and does n’t check their ticket ? ’ she says			2
deadline : an unlucky lottery winner stands to lose £ 64million unless they claim their prize by 11pm others are more sympathetic			1
at the @entity228 on the @entity61 , @entity227 has been searching through his shop after losing a ticket he bought on the same day as the elusive winner			1
‘ i ’ve looked everywhere , ’ he says			0
‘ in the end i called @entity110 and told them when and where i bought it			2
they wrote back to me with a photocopy of my ticket , proving that i had not won anything			2
’ of course , the treasure hunt would not be needed if @entity110 revealed the precise place where the winning ticket was sold			1
purchasing records mean that they can easily identify the shop — but the company ’s licence forbids it from making that information public in order to maximise the winner ’s chances of anonymity			1
retired shop worker @entity249 says this is wrong and that @entity110 should check @entity252 footage in the shop where the ticket was sold			1
‘ it would save the rest of us a lot of bother , ’ he adds			0
still not knowing if they sold the ticket , newsagents @entity58 and @entity261 have erected a huge mock - up of what the winning ticket would look like			1
they say : ‘ it would be brilliant if someone claimed the money at the last minute			0
hopefully they ’d share it out			0
it would be very exciting			0
’ very exciting indeed — though with only hours left to track down the ticket , the chances are fast dwindling			2
but , you never know			0
three years ago , a @entity276 winner scooped £ 2.5 million just before the 180 - day deadline expired			1
so , @entity1 , keep rummaging — it could still be you .			1

an 11pm deadline has been set for the winner of the @entity21 jackpot from june 8 to claim their prize
the winning ticket was bought in a shop in @entity1 , @entity2
