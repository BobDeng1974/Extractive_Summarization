by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:47 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 10:09 est , 2 september 2013 the world ’s largest solar boat has docked in @entity4 , its final port of call on an epic voyage of scientific discovery along the @entity8			1
the @entity9 cruised along the @entity10 yesterday before docking at @entity12 where it will stay until tomorrow			1
this is the first time the impressive catamaran has visited the @entity15 , making its grand entrance by floating under an open @entity17 yesterday afternoon			2
the impressive vessel crossed the @entity37 in a record breaking 22 days earlier this year when it travelled from @entity39 , @entity40 to @entity41 in the @entity42			2
its 809 solar panels can generate up to 480 kwh on a sunny day			0
launched in @entity48 , its @entity47 expedition sought to collect a continuous series of physical and biological measurements along the @entity8 , both from the water and the atmosphere , using advanced instruments onboard			1
it will remain docked at @entity12 , @entity4 , until tomorrow , giving enthusiasts the opportunity to admire its streamlined design and innovative energy technologies			1
the @entity9 arrived on the @entity10 in @entity4 yesterday , its final port of call in a voyage of environmental discovery the eco-friendly boat will be docked at @entity12 until september 2			1
enthusiasts have the chance to visit the impressive vessel whose solar panels can generate 480 kwh on a sunny day the vessel is a scientific research platform for the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , has a top speed of 14 knots and is home to up to nine crew members at a time , including scientists			2
it is stuffed with atmospheric instruments , some of which are prototypes developed by the university			0
all aboard the @entity21 , the world 's largest solar powered boat led by professor @entity83 , climatologist and director of the @entity85 at @entity68 , the research team studied the key parameters of climate regulation , focusing on aerosols and phytoplankton			1
their aim is to improve the understanding of complex interactions between the ocean and atmosphere , as well as the role these interactions play in climate change			1
the world 's largest solar boat is making @entity4 its final port of call on an epic voyage of scientific discovery along the @entity8 the @entity21 has 512 square metres of photovoltaic cells and is capable of crossing the @entity37 in just 22 days the vessel is a scientific research platform for the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) , has a top speed of 14 knots and is home to up to nine crew members at a time , including scientists it is the first time the impressive catamaran has visited the @entity15 and it will be docked at @entity12 from tomorrow until monday 2nd september to show off its solar panels that can generate 480 kwh on a sunny day			1
it is pictured in @entity115 he said : ' the @entity47 expedition has allowed intensive testing in real - world conditions of a number of ocean and atmospheric instruments , some of which are prototypes			1
' there is now a wealth of physical , chemical , and biological data housed at the @entity68 , and which is beginning to undergo exhaustive scientific scrutiny			0
' although the data has not been analysed yet , we have noticed some very interesting trends , especially with regards to the production of aerosols by sea sprays , ' he said			0
the boat is approximately 35m long and 23m wide , depending on whether the solar panels are closed - when it is docked or experiencing very rough conditions at sea - or open , in most instances at sea			0
the boat travels at an average speed of five knots and uses a staggering 512 square metres of photovoltaic panels to power six blocks of lithium - ion batteries			1
despite this it is is light , durable and completely silent			0
here , the boat has ' closed ' its solar panels allowing it to dock more easily			0
it also pulls them in when sea conditions are very rough crossing the @entity37 in 22 days , the speedy solar boat compares favourably with a 40 foot sailing ship , which usually takes around 35 days to cross the ocean the university believes it clearly demonstrates the possibilities of solar power for sea travel , with massive implications for sustainable tourism and transport			0
with zero fuel requirements and zero carbon emissions , the boat can take to the open seas for months at a time , so long as the sun continues to rise			0
professor @entity83 said : ' the @entity9 has positive benefits for scientific study and exploration , allowing for pollution - free research to be carried out in the vicinity of the boat			0
' the boat also plays an educational role as the scientists are keen to raise awareness about environmental issues			2
one of the aims of the recent expedition , which stopped at @entity180 , @entity115 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 ’s before journeying to @entity4 , is to promote the use of solar technology			1
it was designed by @entity187 from @entity188 after months of research into creating the optimum dimensions and design of the double - hulled vessel			0
engineers optimised the energy collection and storage as well as the boat ’s aerodynamics , propulsion systems and choice of building materials			0
the light scientific vessel has a carbon structure and is its name is inspired by the literary mythology of @entity205 and literally means ' power of the sun '			1
after visiting @entity4 , the boat will cross the @entity209 and will then dock in @entity210			2
with zero fuel requirements and zero carbon emissions , the boat can take to the open seas for months at a time , so long as the sun continues to rise			0
this is the high - tech control panel the boat is stuffed with atmospheric instruments , some of which are prototypes and for the past four months has been analysing the @entity8 to collect data that might inform scientists about climate change			1

the next stop is @entity210			0

the @entity21 cruised into @entity4 yesterday to dock at @entity12
@entity4 is last port of call in environmental expedition across the @entity8
the eco-friendly vessel has a *lightweight* carbon structure and 512 square metres of photovoltaic cells
launched in @entity48 , its @entity47 expedition has collected data along the @entity8 to help scientists get a better idea of climate change
