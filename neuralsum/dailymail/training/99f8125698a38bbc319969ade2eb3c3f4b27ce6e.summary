a friend recently asked where he should take his wife on honeymoon			2
without much hesitation , i suggested @entity6 in southern @entity7			1
i had not been there			2
my punt was based on pretty pictures on the internet and a feeling that @entity7 in general has become one of the world ’s hottest destinations ( even though things have turned tricky in the build - up to the @entity19 )			1
it also filled me with a keen ambition to see this splendid retreat for myself			2
paradise : @entity6 in @entity7 is a 25 - bungalow beach resort where staff outnumber guests three to one so , here i am — on the expansive terrace of bungalow 24 ( excuse the name - dropping , but @entity31 has stayed in the bungalow next door ) , watching an old fishing boat chugging across a bay that looks more like a giant lake than the @entity37			1
a range of hills is silhouetted on the horizon , two vultures are circling high above in the blue sky , and my own wife is splashing about in the infinity plunge pool , proffering insights such as : ‘ oh , my @entity47 , this is unbelievable ! ’ she is right , as usual			2
this beautiful and tranquil spot has managed to remain off the radar of discerning @entity51 travellers despite occupying a privately owned peninsula , about 20 miles south of @entity53 this is an extraordinarily beautiful and tranquil spot , one which somehow has managed to remain off the radar of discerning @entity51 travellers despite occupying a privately owned peninsula , about 20 miles south of @entity53 in @entity57 , for more than 12 years			1
it is surrounded by the sea , and is hidden on a hill where every tree and shrub seems to be blooming with unbridled happiness			2
there are only 25 bungalows poking out from the lush greenery , each completely private , many with hammocks on the terrace , some with pools or hot tubs			1
there is a private beach , and across from the restaurant there is a little island where my friend and his blushing bride will be served dinner surrounded by hundreds of dancing candles			2
the two main investors — one from @entity83 , the other from @entity51 — wanted to launch a hotel that had only one rule : there should be no rules			2
breakfast , lunch or dinner ? the only rule is that there are no rules and guests can eat whatever , whenever they want this means breakfast is available all day , dinner all night			1
you wear what you like when you like , and even if you never want to emerge from your bungalow , the charming staff — nearly all of whom come from the fishing village at the bottom of the hill — will miraculously tidy up without you noticing			1
@entity57 is unlike anywhere else in @entity7			0
there are native @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and many more — most of whom arrived during the 19th century , lured by the lucrative whaling business and the opportunity for new beginnings			0
those employed at @entity121 have impeccable manners and out - number guests by almost three to one			1
some of them float around as if in a state of higher consciousness , imbuing the whole place with an irresistible @entity129 - like ambience			1
but they wear it all so lightly — just as the whole resort plays down its home - made eco system , its strict recycling policy , its quiet sophistication			1
you can fish , play tennis , work out in the gym ( if you must ) , go rafting , kayaking and snorkelling , watch movies in the private cinema , or do nothing except listen to the creaking bamboos when the wind blows			0
@entity6 is part of the @entity148 group , which is generally indication that the food will be top - notch			1
it is — and it ’s different , too			0
on offer at breakfast is a tasting menu that changes every day , comprising ten exquisite little offerings , from a shot of pineapple , coconut water and mint juice to miniature goat cheese - and - herb omelettes in little shells			1
bathroom with a view : the bungalows all feature phenomenal views out to sea oysters and mussels — harvested locally — are available around the clock , and the baked sea bass dissolves in your mouth like butter , but with fewer calories			0
at dinner , there are @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180 influences and the @entity183 wines are sensational			0
according to legend , @entity184 — as the village is called — was named after @entity187 , referred to as captain @entity188 ( gancho means ‘ hook ’ in @entity180 )			0
another theory is that the name derives from the special hooks used by local fishermen			0
one morning , a member of staff takes us on a trail which ends up on a beach that is only accessible on foot			1
here , we find two surfers bobbing up and down in the water , and hundreds of crabs scurrying around as if enjoying their own carnival			0
that evening , rain hammers down			0
we go to the beach			0
forget @entity207 ’ in the rain — swimmin ’ in the rain hits all the right notes and feels like a holy baptism of sorts			0
we are joined by gulls dive - bombing the water in search of a few tiddlers for supper			1
i read somewhere that @entity183 hospitality can be separated into two categories : before your stay at @entity121 , and after			0
this could well be right			0
what i know for sure is that my honeymoon recommendation is utterly brilliant			0
the @entity227 ( 020 3051 8098 , theultimatetravel company.co.uk ) offers seven nights at @entity121 from £ 2,850 pp. a seven - night stay in a beachside cabana comes with breakfast			1
the price also includes @entity234 flights from @entity235 and private transfers .			0
