saturday night , and it was light entertainment time , with the @entity3 version of it ’s a knockout			2
this time around , it was the @entity6 ’s chance to introduce the boys from @entity8 as the opening act after @entity10 had the honours on the opening day			1
back then , @entity6 had @entity13 as one of her main strikers			1
but he has now lost his place alongside @entity17			0
with a philosophical gallic shrug - which basically said ‘ i have no idea why the @entity21 season is starting up again during the @entity3 ? ’ - he said adieu last week , and went back to training for his club in @entity25			1
off the bench has come @entity27			1
enjoying the kind of finale to a career most of us could only dream of			0
three weeks by @entity37 being slightly more memorable than some warm wine and nibbles in the office , i ’d venture to suggest			0
but this was the only dark note in a quite riveting two hours or so of telly			0
even if the last @entity55 on the field of play in @entity8 very nearly became the big story			1
the camera seems to really love @entity60			1
or perhaps it ’s the other way around ? either way , his already melodramatic performance suddenly took centre stage when he disallowed @entity67 ’s second - half goal			1
now , if this were domestic coverage of the game , the following few minutes would have forensically picked the moment apart			2
while also giving us relentless up close and personal looks at @entity60 and his partner - in - crime with the flag , @entity76			1
but just as @entity77 was telling us us on commentary that @entity8 ‘ heads are turning to monitors ’ on the bench to see the damning images , so the world was being shown a substitution rather than the moment of the match			1
which can often be par for the course with this kind of international event telly coverage			2
because when the pictures are being used by an abundance of broadcasters , the safest option is to provide more neutral pictures , tempered with plenty of surrounding colour			0
nevertheless , this sense of occasion can actually also make a moment really special			0
such as with the epic penalty shoot - out			0
this was truly marvelous sport on the telly			0
firstly , because the scatter gun images captured so much tension and emotion			0
and secondly because the @entity6 stuck with those shots , and had the studio provide fabulous voice - overed insight ( ‘ i was next in @entity114 ’ , shuddered @entity43 at the thought			1
‘ and my legs had gone ’ ) into the intensity and pressure of the situation on the players			0
centre of attention : @entity60 disallows @entity67 's goal , which would have put @entity8 2 - 1 ahead later that evening on @entity10 , it was the part two of the evening ’s entertainment			1
and clearly @entity127 and the boys had got all their clothes back from the dry cleaners			0
because there they were at the top of the show , by the beach , giving the casual wear a run out			2
@entity143 the only man adding a touch of decorum to the whole sorry shorts ‘ n ’ sandals affair by sporting a splendid panama hat			0
while at half - time , they were back in the studio , but now dressed like they were all set to hit happy hour as soon as the game finished			2
although if the final whistle blew and we came back to them all in pyjamas , i also would n’t have been surprised			0
somewhere in the middle of all this , of course , @entity157 had seen off @entity161 with very little effort			1
and delivered the goal of the tournament so far , in the process			2
but with that goal came something of a conundrum over at @entity10			1
all based around the scorer of the goal , @entity42			1
soaking up the sun : @entity10 began their presentation of @entity173 against @entity161 on the beach change : @entity10 returned to their studio at half - time during @entity173 's win over @entity161 stars of the show : @entity173 lit up the @entity180 as they beat @entity161 to move into the quarter - final in the build up to the game , @entity183 went in hard on the pronouncing of his first name , spelt simply @entity188			1
hah - mez , said @entity143 with a real flourish			0
which seemed to meet with the approval of both @entity192 and @entity193 alongside him			0
however , on commentary , @entity194 was having none of it			0
indeed , when @entity42 rattled in his wonder volley , he even added a fee extra ‘ a ’s ’ to the very familiar pronouncing of @entity188			2
@entity127 then added fuel to the fire at half - time			0
after @entity143 said of the goal he could ‘ watch it all day ’ , @entity127 suggested he also thought @entity42 ‘ calls himself @entity205 ’			1
then added that perhaps after that goal , all the other @entity188 ’s out there might want to follow suit ? in which case , i ’d just like to say to hah - @entity205 may , @entity214 and perhaps even @entity215 , @entity214 - @entity217 - great stuff so far , is n’t it ? even if @entity194 still thinks you are still all plain old @entity188 ’ .			2

@entity27 *drafted* into @entity6 studio for coverage of @entity8 against @entity223
@entity27 *replaced* @entity13 , who returned to continue @entity21 season
@entity10 presented first part of @entity173 vs @entity161 coverage from beach
@entity60 centre of attention after @entity67 's disallowed goal
@entity42 scored for @entity173 but *pronunciation* of his name proved tough for @entity10 *pundits*
