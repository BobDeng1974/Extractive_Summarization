an unknown @entity0 playing in his first @entity2 event will have the chance to complete an unbelievable fairytale at the @entity5 on sunday and earn the most unlikely invitation to the masters			1
@entity9 - born @entity8 has only played a handful of events on the subsidiary circuit , the @entity13 but decided to enter qualifying for the @entity15 event			1
this is a real 36 hole lottery where 131 players were fighting for the final four spots			2
with two excellent rounds of 64 , the 27 - year - old finished tied first to earn his place – and how he has taken advantage			1
it was a decent achievement in itself to make the halfway cut , and it earned him a third round draw alongside two rather more famous englishmen in @entity28 and @entity29			1
@entity8 is three shots behind the leaders and remains in with a chance of making the masters day , however , refused to be overawed as he put together a tidy , bogey - free scorecard to match the 68 shot by @entity28 and upstage @entity36 , who shot 72			1
incredibly , that has left @entity38 in tied sixth place , just three shots off the lead held , almost inevitably , by the remarkably consistent young @entity42 , @entity43			1
realistically , a top ten finish would be a fine achievement for day , which would earn him a place in the field for the tournament after the masters , the @entity49 in @entity51			1
but it is worth bearing in mind that a victory would not only earn him a @entity2 card but the last spot in the field for @entity58			1
would n’t that be some story ? @entity28 only learned he was in the field for the masters himself last sunday , and is continuing his welcome revival this season with another good showing			2
he is a former winner of this event and again showed his liking for the course			0
record crowds descended on the @entity15 suburb of @entity69 to watch the great crowd pleaser @entity71 , who began one off the halfway lead and the newest @entity74 golfing hero , @entity43			2
@entity43 leads the way in @entity15 but while the latter delivered with a 67 to lead the way on 14 under , @entity71 could only muster a 75 to tumble down the leaderboard			2
it ’s amazing to think it ’s only 18 months since @entity43 was attracting heavy criticism for dropping out of college to take his place on the @entity2 as the 809th ranked player in the world			2
while his former university classmates are studying hard for their final exams , 21 year old @entity43 might be said to have passed his own particular exam with flying colours , since he has risen to fourth in the world and will go second behind @entity91 should he claim this title on sunday			0
he would also take his earnings over those 18 months to almost $ 12 million			0
funnily enough , he ’s not attracting criticism anymore			0
@entity43 , watched by his parents and younger sister @entity96 , hass a one stroke advantage over a trio of lesser - known countrymen – @entity100 , former @entity15 champion @entity101 and @entity102			0
‘ i ’ve got a lot of friends as well as my family in the gallery and i shall certainly be trying to win for them on sunday , ’ said @entity43			0
if he did that it would be his fourth victory in his last nine starts and underline his status as one of the favourites to win the green jacket			0
@entity43 finished runner - up behind @entity116 on his @entity118 debut last year			1
like day , 24 year old @entity102 is trying to write an astonishing story of his own			0
he just happens to be the monday qualifier who tied day for first place			1
as for @entity71 , his poor form over the past few months caught up with him on saturday after opening rounds of 66 and 67 had raised hopes he was close to his best			0
the 44 year old fell apart over the closing stretch , registering four bogeys in his last five holes .			0

@entity8 , from @entity9 , has played a handful of events on @entity13
he entered the qualifying for the @entity5 and finished tied first
he then made the cut and is now three shots off the lead
@entity140 would earn him a place in the @entity118 field
