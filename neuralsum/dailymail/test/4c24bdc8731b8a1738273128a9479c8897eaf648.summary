everyone loves a bargain , even in the mega-rich territory of the @entity3			1
where else to look for a steal than in the bargain basement ? that is where clubs at the top level can look down at the championship and below to take their pick of the players trying to impress			0
yet it can be a case of hit and @entity18 , @entity14 looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the @entity3 , and others who can do so too			1
@entity24 ( @entity23 to @entity25 in july 2014 – £ 2million ) the full - back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team 's @entity3 games this season @entity24 began at @entity32 , making his debut in november 2008			1
from there , he moved to @entity23 in june 2011 , apparently turning down @entity35 and @entity36			1
he won the @entity38 award , and was linked with @entity39			0
yet it was @entity25 who signed the left - back on a five - year contract , spending just £ 2m in doing so			1
@entity24 has made 32 appearances in the @entity3 since , and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of @entity47 and @entity48			1
both clubs need to add more home - grown talent to their squads , and the @entity25 regular would add to that batch			1
@entity24 has proved a good fit for the @entity3 since signing for @entity25 in july 2014 @entity55 ( @entity56 to @entity57 in january 2013 - £ 3m ) @entity58 has the best passing accuracy of any @entity57 player this season - 90.8 % a @entity56 youth product , @entity58 made 25 appearances in the @entity63 for the club , before leaving for @entity57 on a five - and - a - half - year deal			1
it reportedly cost them £ 3m , and he has made 38 appearances in the @entity3 since			1
despite an ankle injury which ruled him out for 10 - 14 weeks , @entity58 was nominated for the @entity72 2014 award alongside @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
during his time in the top flight , he has earned four caps for @entity81			0
@entity55 signed for @entity57 from @entity56 in january 2013 for just £ 3m and has been a good addition @entity85 ( @entity84 to @entity86 in july 2014 - £ 2.85m ) @entity85 has made 40 dribbles this year , 17 more than any other @entity86 defender no disrespect to @entity84 or the @entity90 , but it is widely assumed that the @entity3 is somewhat of a step up			1
some make it , some do n't			0
@entity85 can class himself in the former category			0
the @entity86 youngster has thrived since moving to the @entity98 in july 2014 , and even scored against @entity81 for @entity99 four months later			2
@entity100 , the @entity86 manager , admits he has already had calls from clubs interested in the @entity104 - born left - back , who has made 21 appearances in the @entity3			1
@entity85 joined @entity86 from @entity84 in july 2014 and is pictured a month after signing @entity108 ( @entity109 to @entity110 in july 2014 - £ 8m ) the striker is the @entity112 ' top scorer in the league this season ( 7 ) while no other @entity110 player has had a hand in more goals ( scored seven , assisted two ) @entity108 did n't come cheap			1
yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the @entity3			1
the @entity120 with no caps cost £ 8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club @entity109 he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the @entity3			1
it proved a shrewd move at first			2
the goals may have dried up a little but the striker has performed admirably in his debut season in the top flight			0
nine goals in total as the club 's top scorer			0
yet with @entity110 bottom of the table , @entity108 has a task on his hands to help them survive , otherwise he may well be rendered a @entity63 player once more come may			0
@entity108 did n't come cheap for @entity110 and must help them survive to avoid dropping down a league @entity142 ( @entity143 to @entity144 in july 2013 - £ 4.5m ) after netting five in his first 15 @entity3 appearances , @entity142 has now gone eight games without a goal for @entity144 @entity142 really had to rise through the ranks to join the @entity3			1
he started at @entity149 , currently a club that play in the ninth level on the footballing pyramid			0
from there , he joined @entity154 , before being sent on loan to @entity158 side @entity156			0
yet it was during a loan spell with @entity143 that he truly got his chance			0
playing in the championship helped him progress and he signed for @entity144 in 2013			0
he has made 46 appearances in the @entity3 , scoring 12 goals , and is a regular			2
@entity142 really had to rise through the ranks to join the @entity3 with @entity144 @entity168 ( @entity144 to @entity169 in july 2012 - £ 2.15m ) the @entity81 man has made 99 tackles , the third - highest total in the @entity3 this season and the most by a defender @entity168 was a @entity144 youth product , and made his professional debut in october 2008			1
later , @entity177 would state @entity168 has a ' bright future in the game ' , and he was n't wrong			2
after four years at @entity180 in the @entity63 , winning the @entity38 award in his final season , @entity168 moved to @entity169 for £ 2.15m			1
it 's proved a bargain			2
the right - back is a regular at @entity188 's , and even made his debut for @entity81 in october 2014			1
all this has led the 24 - year - old to be linked with @entity48 and @entity192			2
@entity168 was a @entity144 youth product but signed for @entity169 after their promotion @entity196 ( @entity197 to @entity198 in february 2015 - £ 5m – to join next season ) @entity200 has netted 14 goals for the @entity197 this season , more than any other midfielder for a single club bit of a cheat this one			1
@entity200 meets the criteria , having never played in the top flight before and signing for a @entity3 club , yet he awaits his debut for @entity198			2
the midfielder signed for £ 5m from @entity197 , but was sent back on loan for the remainder of the season			2
will he follow in the footsteps of @entity216 , @entity168 , and so on ? @entity217 will tell			2
@entity196 signed for @entity198 from @entity197 for £ 5m before being sent back on loan so , who could be next to move up to the @entity3 ? @entity220 ( @entity221 ) position : @entity223			1
though left - footed , @entity220 operates on the right and his energy and eye for a goal sum up @entity232 's attacking side			1
a product of @entity235 's academy , he never got a look - in at @entity237 and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight			2
@entity221 winger @entity220 celebrates as @entity221 beat @entity240 on @entity241 @entity242 ( @entity243 ) position : striker			0
what else can you say but @entity251 has more goals than a certain @entity253 this season ? the former @entity256 striker is surely on a shortlist or two for @entity3 clubs			2
he scored his 30th goal of the season against @entity240 on saturday			0
time to step up ? @entity242 has been in prolific form this season first for @entity197 on loan then for @entity243 @entity263 ( @entity240 ) position : attacking midfielder			0
just 18 years old , @entity263 burst into the @entity240 team in 2013			0
in doing so he has began to be called up for @entity81 's youth sides , making three appearances for the @entity272 and four for the @entity273			0
@entity240 had to reject four bids from @entity221 who were keen to sign the starlet , even offering £ 3.5m which could rise to £ 4m with add - ons			2
can they hold on to him for much longer , though ? @entity263 is wanted by a host of clubs but @entity240 are determined to try to keep hold for now @entity284 ( @entity285 ) position : midfielder			0
@entity285 did well to hang on to @entity284 after being relegated last summer and if they do n't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the @entity3 , where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this			1
a powerful , deep - lying midfielder with a solid all - round game , the @entity298 man has added goals to his repertoire this season , scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons			0
experienced midfielder @entity284 has been in prolific form in front of goal this season @entity309 ( @entity310 ) position : striker			0
@entity309 has plundered 63 goals in the @entity63 in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the @entity3 next season			2
a product of @entity323 's academy , @entity309 served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since			0
@entity309 has been consistently excellent for @entity310 over the last three seasons @entity329 ( @entity330 ) position : midfielder			0
not 20 until later this month , @entity329 will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for @entity342 's @entity81 under 21 side , for whom he has 14 caps			0
making his debut as a 17 - year - old , the elegant left - footed midfielder has already played more than 130 times for @entity330 and has no shortage of admirers among the @entity3 's elite			1
@entity330 midfielder @entity329 has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager @entity355 ( @entity243 ) position : @entity223			0
when @entity355 moved to @entity243 for £ 4m from @entity361 he would have had hopes of playing in the @entity3 before too long			1
instead , he found himself in @entity363 a year later			0
to his credit though , he stayed and spearheaded @entity243 ' romp to the @entity363 title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back - to - back promotions			1
his contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if @entity243 achieve that			0
@entity355 ( centre ) has become a cult hero at @entity374 but looks certain to leave if @entity243 do n't go up			0

@entity24 moved to @entity25 from @entity23 for just £ 2m in 2014
the left - back has proved a good fit in the @entity3 since his move
