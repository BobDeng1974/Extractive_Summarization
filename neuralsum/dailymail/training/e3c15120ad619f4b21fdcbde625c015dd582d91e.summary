@entity0 is set to be left out of @entity2 's squad to face city rivals @entity3 on friday , giving further encouragement to @entity5 who are weighing up a £ 50million bid for the @entity10 @entity9 star			1
real contest their second trophy of the season as they play the second leg of the @entity16 against @entity3 with the score 1 - 1 from the first game			2
but there is likely to be no @entity0 after tensions between the player and the @entity23 champions heightened in the last 24 hours			0
out in the cold : @entity0 is set to be left out of @entity2 's @entity16 tie against @entity3 top talent : @entity0 ( right ) came on as a substitute in the @entity16 first leg on tuesday real supporters have left the club in no doubt that they want @entity0 to stay at the club but president @entity33 wants him sold to help the club balance the books after their £ 95m spending spree this summer bringing in @entity37 and @entity38			1
the club were embarrassed by the reaction of the @entity41 on tuesday when @entity0 came on as a second half substitute and was given a huge ovation by supporters			2
on thursday coach @entity44 confirmed the player had turned down the offer of a new contract and asked for a move			0
but @entity0 's new deal would only have seen him bring £ 4m next year and he wants parity with those who are in the second tier of @entity2 's wage structure and earn £ 6m net a season			1
international pedigree : @entity0 played a pivotal role for @entity10 as they reached the @entity60 final supporters who saw him play a huge role in the @entity64 success last season believe he is worth it but the club have made no second offer and he will be a @entity5 player if they find the money to meet both @entity2 's asking price and the player 's wage demands			1
@entity74 paper sport suggests @entity75 have made a £ 48m bid for @entity0 but midfielder @entity77 has dismissed the idea			0
