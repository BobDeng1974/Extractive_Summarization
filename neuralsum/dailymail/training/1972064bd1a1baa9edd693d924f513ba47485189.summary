the government has refused to rule out joining a @entity51 military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees			1
but a @entity119 poll for the @entity120 has revealed support for @entity1 troops to bomb the fanatics			2
the revelation comes as the @entity10 geared up to send @entity29 jets into @entity5 – but only to monitor the humanitarian situation on the ground			0

@entity38 said the prime minister was ‘ very much engaged ’ with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of @entity145 was ‘ not on the cards ’			0
but the prime minister is facing increasing pressure to join @entity51 military action against @entity14 forces			2
@entity170 mp @entity169 said it was time for the @entity1 to take direct military action - through air strikes and drone attacks but not ground forces - and predicted a recalled commons would vote in favour of the escalation			1
' the international community can pour as much aid into the region as its likes , ' he wrote for the @entity184 website			2
' but unless @entity48 fighters are killed and removed from the battlefield , they will go on killing and committing further atrocities			0
' the @entity1 must not walk by on the other side and that is why overnight news that @entity192 are once again going to fly in @entity54 airspace is welcome			2
' however , this intervention needs to be in an unequivocal combat role , not just in an intelligence , surveillance and targeting role			0

a proposed @entity240 resolution was too weak and ' in danger of being just another @entity236 platitude whilst toddlers choke on their own blood ' , he said			0
mr @entity169 said the different circumstances suggested there would be no repeat of @entity154 ' refusal last year to endorse military intervention in @entity132			0
