@entity0 might have a rival in the cute junior royal stakes : his third cousin @entity3 - the daughter of @entity6 and his wife @entity7 , and granddaughter of @entity9			1
the three - year - old 's spirited refusal to wear her woolly hat ( complete with floppy ears and a button nose ) while supporting princes @entity15 and @entity16 at a @entity18 football match was seriously endearing			1
well , for us anyway			0
might have been a different story for her parents			0
dressed in pink wellies , pink tights and a flowery top , the @entity27 's first great - grandchild and the 13th in line to the throne had evidently decided the cute headgear did n't match her outfit			0
she really does n't want to wear that hat ! @entity6 struggles to evade the clutches of her mother @entity7 @entity6 makes a run for it , hat half off - will she manage to escape ? @entity6 was n't happy about having to wear a woolly hat to watch prince @entity15 and @entity40 - even if it did have a cute dog face on it her mother @entity7 's pleas were ignored , as @entity6 stamped her little @entity46 boots and held her ground			1
@entity7 , wearing a beanie complete with fashionable oversized pompom , warm quilted jacket and brown suede knee - high boots , struggled with her daughter on the sidelines of the football pitch - to no avail			1
while the players battled it out beside them , @entity6 and her mother were locked in an equally hard - fought tussle			1
the hat stayed off , in spite of the winter chill			0
@entity6 , her little sister @entity65 , mother @entity7 and father @entity6 were all supporting princes @entity15 and @entity16 in the now - traditional @entity68 fixture involving estate workers near the @entity27 ’s @entity18 in @entity70			1
@entity6 carried one - year - old @entity65 , who also looked a little out of sorts			2
unlike her sibling , she had been persuaded into both a hat and a hood to keep out the cold			0
@entity3 refuses to keep her woolly hat on as she watches prince @entity15 and prince @entity16 play football at @entity18 , @entity70 @entity6 , @entity7 , her little sister @entity65 and @entity6 were all supporting princes @entity15 and @entity16 in the now - traditional @entity68 fixture involving estate workers near the @entity27 ’s @entity18 in @entity70 as the football players battle for supremacy in the background , @entity6 refuses to give in on her own struggle : the gloves - and the hat ! - are off ! the two princes were playing on opposite sides in the match , which proved a competitive affair			1
while the banter was relatively friendly , it was clear that the brothers were playing to win as they clattered into each other on the rain - sodden pitch at @entity95			0
at one stage , @entity16 , 29 – still bearded from his @entity98 charity trek – made fun of an opponent ’s corner kick			2
@entity15 , 31 , jokingly pleaded with the referee to issue a card , saying : ‘ give him yellow , give him yellow – backchat			0
' you were pointing at the wrong person , @entity15 - if anyone deserved a yellow card that day , it was little @entity6 ! @entity6 was left in charge of @entity6 's little sister @entity65 , who did n't look much cheerier than her sibling			2
although she had been persuaded into both a hat and a hood .			0
