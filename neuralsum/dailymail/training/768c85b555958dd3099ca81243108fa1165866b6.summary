by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 10:31 est , 6 march 2014 from questionable flings to dodgy piercings , there are few teenagers who have n't made an embarrassing mistake or two			0
but for @entity9 , a 32 - year - old health and safety inspector , his teenage blooper has had lasting consequences			1
aged 15 , he got a huge bulldog tattoo in the middle of his chest but when he tried to have it removed , he was left covered in scars - and with remnants of the inking still in place			1
gruesome : the pitted and scarred tattoo left on @entity9 's chest following bungled surgery to remove it big mistake : @entity9 aged 15 with the bulldog tattoo that has proved so troublesome ' it 's been a long process for one mistake that i made , ' he explains			1
' it 's all just one big ball of embarrassment			0
' his problems began when he decided to get a tattoo of a bulldog in the centre of his chest when he was aged 15 - much to his family 's horror			1
' i was just horrified , ' remembers @entity9 's mother @entity41			2
' it did n't do anything to enhance @entity9 as i knew him			2
' but worse was to come when , 11 years later , he attempted to have it removed using a silicone solution intended to force the colour out			1
' it was almost like re-tattooing , ' remembers @entity9 , ' but it was done in a circular dot form and they injected a silicone solution in there that pushed the tattoo ink out			1
' the results , however , were not what he 'd been hoping for			0
instead of a smooth tattoo - free chest , he was left with a collection of lumpy scars - and traces of left - over ink			1
thanks to the messy result , @entity9 was left with his self - esteem in tatters and says he is too embarrassed to take his shirt off in company			1
' i 've got a daughter , ' he adds			0
' i want to look forward to holidays where i can lie on beaches with my top off like any normal guy			0
' improving : @entity9 has now had laser surgery to remove the rest of the ink , although the scars remain painful : a laser specialist gets to work on the remains of @entity9 's disfiguring bulldog inking in a bid to finally rid himself of the disfiguring mess left by the bungled tattoo removal , @entity9 consulted @entity88 's dermatologist , dr @entity87			1
her solution was a course of laser treatments to remove the remaining ink followed by steroid injections to rid him off the scarring			0
speaking after the first round of laser treatment , @entity9 said : ' i wo n't dumb it down and say it is n't painful at all because it does really hurt			2
' but it 's all just been a self - esteem killer			0
i 'm really pleased with the progress i 've made - i really can see an end to the entire issue now			0
he added : ' i can already feel the difference in my life			0
my self - esteem is definitely on the up now			0
' @entity9 appears on @entity110 , tonight at 8pm on @entity111			2
