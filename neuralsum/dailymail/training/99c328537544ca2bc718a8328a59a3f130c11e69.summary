by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 00:59 est , 15 august 2012 updated : 00:59 est , 15 august 2012 accused : @entity3 , 58 , pictured in 2009 , has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife , @entity6 the judge at @entity3 's murder trial on tuesday lambasted prosecutors who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors -- again raising the possibility that the case could end with the judge letting the former police officer go free			1
@entity3 , a 58 - year - old retired police officer from @entity20 , has pleaded not guilty to murder in the 2004 death of his third wife , @entity6 , which prosecutors believe he had made look like an accident			1
he was only charged after his fourth wife , @entity27 , vanished in 2007			1
@entity3 is a suspect in that case , but has not been charged			2
judge @entity29 seemed unmoved by repeated apologies by an attorney for the state and said he would rule wednesday on whether to declare a mistrial in a case beset by problems from its outset			1
just two hours before , @entity29 had told prosecutor @entity38 not to ask a witness about whether @entity40 had sought an order of protection against @entity3 in front of the jury			1
when she did , he told jurors to leave the room and berated the prosecutor			0
' there was one thing i told you not to go into and that 's exactly what you did , ' @entity29 told her			1
investigators collected no physical evidence after @entity40 was found dead in a dry bathtub at her home , and authorities initially ruled that @entity40 accidentally drowned			2
but after @entity3 's fourth wife , @entity27 , disappeared in 2007 , @entity40 's body was re-examined and her death was reclassified as a homicide			1
@entity63 explained that the question was on a prepared list of questions and that she read it inadvertently			0
' i 'm sorry , ' @entity63 said			0
' it 's my fault			0
i ca n't believe i did it			0
' during a break , @entity63 sat in an adjoining courtroom , her shoulders slumped forward , her face buried in her hands , shaking her head over and over			0
her boss , @entity80 state 's attorney @entity79 , stood a few feet away , his head down			0
the error came just as the trial seemed to be going prosecutors ' way in recent days , with the judge granting them permission to present hearsay evidence central to their case			2
grave charges : @entity3 is accused of murdering @entity6 , left			2
it was initially thought that she had drowned accidentally in the bathtub , right , but after her body was exhumed her death was ruled as a homicide @entity98 , or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness , is not usually admissible in court , but @entity103 passed a law – known as ' @entity105 ' - in the wake of the @entity3 case that allows it in certain circumstances			2
prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking @entity3 to @entity40 's death , so hearsay evidence about what @entity40 allegedly said to other people is crucial to their case			1
the mistake also came as @entity63 was questioning one of the state 's most compelling witnesses so far			0
former police officer @entity121 had just told jurors about interviewing @entity40 in 2002 after @entity3 allegedly broke into @entity40 's home in a @entity125 uniform and repeatedly pushed her to the ground			1
at one point , @entity40 allegedly told @entity3 , ' go ahead and do what you came to do : kill me , ' @entity121 testified			2
' he said , " where do you want it ? " and she said , " in the head			0
@entity3 then allegedly told @entity40 to turn her head , which @entity40 did , @entity121 said , based on what @entity40 told her			2
' and then he said , " i ca n't kill you , '' she told jurors			0
@entity3 then threw a garage opener to the ground and left			0
blunders : the judge at @entity3 's murder trial on tuesday lambasted prosecutors , namely @entity38 seen here , who for the third time in as many weeks broached a subject they were told not to mention in front of jurors shortly after @entity121 finished telling that story , @entity63 turned and asked , ' did she tell you she wanted to get an order of protection ? ' the defense objected to @entity63 's question , and the judge asked jurors to leave the room			1
@entity40 had n't asked for such an order at that point and the judge would have regarded the subject as creating a bias against @entity3 , a @entity20 defense attorney not connected with the case explained			1
' it can affect a jury unfairly because it 's a signal that he is a bad , violent person , ' attorney @entity166 explained			0
defense attorneys asked not only for a mistrial but for a ' mistrial with prejudice , ' meaning @entity3 could be set free and never be charged again with @entity40 's murder			1
declaring a mistrial with prejudice is a rare judicial step			0
@entity29 could also declare a more standard mistrial , meaning @entity3 would be retried later			1
in memoriam : flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of @entity6 , the third wife of @entity3 , at the @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity103 the judge could also instruct the jury to disregard what the prosecutor said			1
if he takes that route , it could still signal to jurors that prosecutors have -- again -- messed up , potentially influencing their decision during deliberations			0
defense attorney @entity195 cited other times prosecutors broached prohibited subjects , including when @entity198 -- just 10 minutes into his opening statement -- referred to an accusation that @entity3 once tried to hire a hit man			2
' it is an avalanche of prejudicial , illegal evidence that is polluting this jury , ' he said			0
' to have this many ... errors , how can the defendant get a fair trial ? ' @entity3 is a suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , who is presumed dead but whose body has never been found			1
he has never been charged in that case			0
defense attorneys not connected to the @entity3 case expressed disbelief that prosecutors have made so many mistakes			2
' it 's , at minimum , sloppy , ' said @entity220 , who represented imprisoned former @entity103 gov. @entity221 at his first corruption trial			0
missing : @entity3 , left , is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife , @entity27 , right			1

@entity3 pleaded not guilty to murdering his third wife , @entity6 , in 2004
only charged with @entity40 's murder after his fourth wife went missing
judge @entity29 told prosecutors not to ask witnesses about whether @entity40 sought an order of protection against @entity3
prosecution asked this question and defense have asked for ' mistrial with prejudice '
if ' mistrial with prejudice ' is granted @entity3 can not be charged with @entity40 's murder again
@entity29 could just issue a standard mistrial , allowing @entity3 to be tried again
