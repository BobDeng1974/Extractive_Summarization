by @entity0 published : 04:50 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 03:23 est , 18 september 2013 dreams have provided an endless source of fascination and inspiration for many a would - be analyser , probably for as long as man has walked the earth			2
but the father of a boy with a big imagination has taken the surreal ideas one step further and meticulously recorded his son 's fantastic imagination in a photographic project that has taken him six years			1
from a @entity16 hovering over a church , to dinosaurs roaming the countryside , @entity20 , 60 , has recreated his son @entity22 's nocturnal meanderings using a range of clever photography tricks and software			1
nighttime adventures : three tyrannosaurus rex heads tower over @entity22 , here in the foreground extraterrestrial : three ufos hover above the earth and @entity22 looks on as one lights up the church @entity34 : when @entity22 dreamed of being an octopus , dad @entity20 decided to bring the experience to life amphibious : a pod of dinosaurs appear close to the shore , one of which has collected a boat on its head low and behold : this is how a herd of flying cows appeared to @entity22 in one of his dreams one night mr @entity20 , of @entity52 in @entity53 , created the set of photographs after his 10 - year - old son told him about the adventures he had been having while asleep at night			1
their conversations marked the start of the six - year project , which began when @entity22 was just four years old			1
mr @entity20 said : ' i wanted to put my son into his own imaginary world			1
' i began putting them together when @entity22 was four after i was inspired when i watched him playing with his toys , and so the photos are a combination of those two things			2
walking with giants : this diplodocus appeared roaming the countryside during one of @entity22 's dreams boa contstrictor : the appearance of the @entity78 snake may suggest @entity22 was feeling constrained mammoth : in this escapade , @entity22 got to within touching distance of a wooly mammoth prehistoric : dinosaurs feature heavily in @entity22 's nighttime imaginings			1
here he runs towards flying terrodactyls good gourd : @entity22 wandered across a field to get a closer look at what appears to be a giant pumpkin ' although @entity22 has n't had any direct input into the images , the conversations we 've had have contributed to them			2
' often he 's imagined fantastic things or described a world he was imagining , such as seeing himself as an octopus or pretending to be a tornado			0
' i think that it is important to be able to have an imagination at any age , and i tried to get this across by combining my own ideas as well as @entity22 's			0
' mr @entity20 took time to ensure he got the dreams just right , by also using some of the qualities he saw in 19th century photography			2
he added : : ' the images were all created with a digital camera , @entity111 , and a little imagination			0
' i tend to get a very positive reaction to the photographs			0
people seem to really enjoy the imaginary quality of the images			0
' flee : @entity22 turns and runs as the herd of giant wooly mammoths appear in the distance tornado : reminiscent of the @entity123 , @entity22 sees a house swept up with a woman on a bike and a cow perspective : @entity22 looks back to earth from the moon			0
it is not clear whether he planted the flag			0
