a major review of studies found adding this amount of fish to the diet cuts the breast cancer risk by up to 14 per cent			1
fish supplies omega - 3 fatty acids which are essential for brain development and also thought to reduce inflammation of the brain , cardiovascular system and other cells			1
but surveys suggest nine out of 10 children and two - thirds of adults in @entity28 never bother to eat it			2
the best dietary source of omega - 3 fatty acids is oily fish because the human body can not produce them			1
almost 50,000 women in the @entity28 develop breast cancer each year , and the rate is rising			0
previous research has suggested that @entity39 is the most promising type of fat to cut cancer risk , but results have been inconsistent			2
a team of researchers based in @entity46 set out to investigate the link between fish and omega - 3 intake and the risk of breast cancer			2
they measured intake from both dietary sources and blood tests , according to a report in the @entity56			0
they reviewed and analysed the results of 26 studies from the @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 involving over 800,000 participants and over 20,000 cases of breast cancer			0
the latest study found an extra 0.1 g or 0.1 per cent of energy per day derived from omega - 3 fatty acids in fish was linked with a five per cent reduction in risk			2
overall , omega - 3 fatty acids from fish sources was linked with a 14 per cent cut in breast cancer between the highest and lowest levels of intake			1
the risk was lowest in @entity77 populations , probably because fish intake is much higher in @entity62 than in western countries , say the authors			0
further analysis suggested that more protection came from eating more oily fish - an extra 0.1 g or 0.1 per cent of energy per day derived from omega - 3 fatty acids in fish was linked with a five per cent reduction in risk			1
to achieve this level of risk reduction , women should eat one to two portions a week of oily fish such as salmon , tuna or sardines			2
reduced risk : almost 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year - but new research suggests more omega - 3 in their diet can help the authors say their analysis , together with previous publications , supports a ‘ protective role ’ of omega - 3 fatty acids from fish on the incidence of breast cancer			1
they say the study provides ‘ solid and robust evidence ’ which could be enhanced by additional research comparing women ’s omega - 3 dietary intake and breast cancer incidence , it says			0
britons are currently advised to eat fish at least twice a week , including one portion of oily fish			0
a portion is 140g or six ounces			0
the human body can not produce omega - 3 fatty acids and the best dietary source is oily fish			1
types of fish that contain high levels include tuna , salmon , mackerel , herring , sardines , and anchovies			0
white fish is also a healthy food including cod , haddock and plaice although it contains lower levels of essential fatty acids			0
@entity140 , @entity141 at @entity142 said the research may have failed to account for women with healthier diets being leaner			0
she said ‘ while this research reported a reduction in breast cancer risk of 14 per cent for women consuming the highest levels of a particular type of fatty acid , it is important to note that body mass index ( @entity148 ) was not factored into the findings which could go some way to explaining this link			1
‘ further research is needed in order to understand any links between @entity148 , fatty acids found in fish and breast cancer risk			1
‘ maintaining a healthy weight , exercise and reducing alcohol intake can help reduce the risk of breast cancer and other diseases			0
’ @entity171 , @entity172 ’s senior policy officer said ‘ it ’s difficult to say with any certainty which foods or dietary factors have an impact on breast cancer risk , since we all eat a variety of different foods , and our diet changes over our lifetime			2
‘ the study found that fatty acids found in fish could be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer , but there ’s not enough evidence yet to suggest eating fish will reduce a person ’s individual risk			1
however , we do recommend that all people eat a healthy balanced diet for their general health and wellbeing , of which fish can certainly form a part			0

@entity39 fatty acids can cut breast cancer risk by up to 14 per cent
oily fish is the best source - but two thirds of adults never eat it
also essential for brain development and reducing inflammation
