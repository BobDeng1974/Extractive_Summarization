by @entity0 @entity2 's very first bridge might have been the work of the @entity4 but as these incredible images reveal , subsequent architects certainly were n't short of bright ideas			1
from the austere @entity8 , which sits on a site occupied by bridges for more than 2,000 years , to the gaudy crimson and cream steelwork of @entity13 , many of the capital 's bridges are works of art in their own right			1
now , for the first time , @entity2 's 20 river crossings are to get a starring role in a new exhibition , @entity13 , which explores the pivotal role they played over the centuries as well as their impact on the arts			1
turn of the century : despite the lack of cars , @entity29 's @entity8 was a hive of people , carts and carriages as this photo taken in 1900 reveals all change : @entity8 remains a busy place come rush hour but the bridge itself is relatively new : @entity29 's bridge was replaced by the current one in 1972 striking : this @entity44 photograph shows a trio of little girls and their father on @entity48 looking out over @entity49 different view : the view from @entity48 has changed markedly since the 1950s and now includes the towering @entity52 , the @entity54 's ( and @entity55 's ) tallest building iconic : @entity57 's photographs of the houses of @entity59 and @entity60 ( left ) and @entity48 with its bascules raised were made in 1965 and 1973 new look : although the houses of @entity59 and @entity60 look the same as they did during the @entity66 period , all are lit up at night spruced up : modern day @entity48 boasts a patriotic colour scheme and amazing views of the @entity69 and the @entity70 behind featuring photos by @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 among others , the exhibition , at the @entity78 , also offers a snapshot of the changing face of the capital over the last 200 years			1
earliest of all the photos is a rare snap taken by pioneering photographer @entity84 in 1845 , which shows the original @entity86 @entity85 - demolished just 15 years after it was built			1
@entity84 invented the precursor to the modern camera and system of fixing photos that dominated the 19th and 20th centuries , until digital photography became pre-eminent in the early years of the 21st			2
he began developing his ‘ calotype ’ system in the 1830s but only published his work in 1839			0
until 1845 , methods of fixing an image were far from foolproof – and it was n't until that year that he made his major breakthrough			0
among @entity84 's first wave of successful ' calotypes ' was a snap of @entity86 ’s @entity85 - originally built to serve the @entity102 on the north bank of the river , which had been set up by sir @entity105 in 1682 as a competitor to @entity107			1
rare : this 1845 salt print was taken by pioneering photographer @entity84 and shows @entity86 's @entity85 new bridge : @entity86 's suspension bridge was knocked down 15 years after it was built and replaced with this heavier cast iron affair packed : commuters flock across the newly rebuilt @entity8 after its grand opening by the @entity115 in 1973			1
the current bridge is the fifth version on the site			0
still busy ! @entity8 remains a commuter short cut thanks to the presence of the nearby @entity122 under construction : a rare snap of @entity48 as it was being built			1
although it looks medieval , the bridge is actually @entity66 and opened in 1894 all done : @entity48 , now complete , has swapped its chocolate brown @entity66 paint job for a cheerful blue and cream one striking : although @entity132 dominates the background of this 1869 photo , it was taken to chart the construction of the @entity136 looking good : named after the @entity138 's famous victory over the @entity139 at @entity132 , @entity132 is now pristine and the @entity136 complete beautiful : this 1955 photograph of @entity143 was taken by @entity144 , a photographer who lived most of her life in nearby @entity146 similar : @entity143 appears to have changed very little and this photo even shows that the prominent houseboats in the first picture remain in place at 1,462 feet long , the bridge was , at the time , one of the longest suspension bridges ever built , although @entity86 , who was already working on several other projects when he took on the @entity85 work , appeared less than enthused by the project			1
an entry in his 1835 diary reads : ‘ suspension bridge across the @entity160 – i have condescended to be engineer of this , but i sha n’t give myself much trouble about it			0
if done it will add to my stock of irons			0
’ despite his lacklustre approach to the work , his bridge proved hugely successful but was later deemed inadequate to meet the demands of the newly opened @entity171 by @entity172 , who purchased it in 1859			0
the replacement , designed by sir @entity176 , opened in 1864 and was built using wrought iron lattice girders , which provided a more stable route in and out of @entity171 station for the heavy iron steam trains then in their heyday			0
eventful though its history is , @entity85 is n't the only bridge to have made its mark on the capital			1
another that appears in several incarnations in the exhibition is @entity8 which has been demolished and rebuilt no fewer than five times , most recently in 1972			2
the very first bridge on the site was the work of the @entity4 who used it outflank the @entity54 waiting upriver at the main ford in @entity196 and paved the way for the addition of @entity199 and @entity200 , @entity201 as it was known to the @entity4 , to the @entity202			2
later versions included a wooden bridge that was badly damaged during fighting between armies loyal to @entity207 king @entity208 and @entity209 in 1014 , and the first stone version which was completed in 1209			0
as remembered in the nursery rhyme , part of this @entity8 really did fall down thanks to neglect on the part of the hugely unpopular @entity115 @entity216 who was given the bridge by her husband @entity218 in 1249			2
calm before the storm : this 1937 shot shows @entity2 in the years leading up to @entity221 - much of the @entity222 around @entity48 was destroyed in the @entity223 no change on this side ! looking at this modern photo of commuters streaming across @entity8 , little appears to have changed since the 1930s striking : this negative of @entity48 was made circa 1903 - 1910 by @entity230 - the @entity54 's first female press photographer pretty : this shot of @entity233 in 1930 was taken by @entity234 , editor of @entity235 , who took photos wherever he went still peaceful : @entity233 has barely changed at all over the last century and remains a pretty , tranquil place to cross the @entity160 peaceful : this late 19th century image shows the serene @entity233 - a far cry from the bustling crowds that flock onto the bridges downstream busy : in the 1930s , the @entity160 was crammed with shipping as this 1935 photo ( left ) reveals			1
by the 1960s , it was the bridges , as in this @entity132 shot , that were packed old @entity8 : a 1929 photo of @entity29 's @entity8 , which now sits in @entity252 in @entity253 after being bought by the @entity254 later , the bridge was famously used to display the heads of traitors executed at the nearby tower , beginning with @entity260 rebel @entity259 who was made an example of by @entity262 of the @entity260 ' in 1305			1
the medieval bridge stood for more than 600 years but in 1831 , it was decided a new bridge was needed and a @entity29 design was chosen			0
seven years later , the new @entity8 was opened by @entity266 and @entity267 , but only lasted until the 1960s thanks to the increasing numbers of cars wanting to use it			2
other bridges to appear include the iconic @entity48 , the new @entity85 and the even more modern @entity272			1
@entity273 , which gets its name from a 13th century @entity139 mercenary employed by @entity276 , who built ' @entity277 ' on the site , also stars in the show			1
speaking about the new exhibition and the incredible @entity282 that appears in it , curator @entity280 said : ' i ’m incredibly excited that visitors will have the opportunity to get up close to such a significant early photograph – taken at a time when the medium was still evolving			0
' by contrasting the old barges in the foreground with the @entity86 's new iron bridge , @entity84 highlights the technological advances of the 19th century			1
' the photographic process he pioneered would dominate image - making for the next 150 years , until the dawn of digital photography			0
in a way , he is responsible for the way in which we see the world today			0
ironically , @entity86 ’s bridge was demolished within fifteen years to make way for a railway crossing			2
' this delicate salt print has never been out on public display before			0
because of its age and the fact that @entity84 only perfected his process in 1845 ; we are not taking any unnecessary risks with it			0
' bridge opens at the @entity78 on the 27th june and runs until the 2nd november			1
see museumoflondon.org for more information			0
@entity2 's 20 bridges are a familiar sight to commuters and tourists who pass them every day but there 's more to the capital 's bridges than iron and steel			0
from the bridge with a paint job chosen by @entity328 to the river crossing that doubled as a market , @entity2 's bridges are as fascinating as its palaces			2
source : @entity2 ’s @entity333 by @entity334 present day : @entity336 's 2011 shot was taken from a perch atop @entity122 and shows a lit up @entity48 on the right as well as miles of train track future : a visualisation of @entity342 's possible new addition			2
@entity345 , if it gets planning permission , is scheduled to open in 2017			0

the photos appear in a new exhibition at the @entity349 which opens on the 27th june
highlights include a rare ' calotype ' of @entity86 's @entity85 dating from 1845
also appearing in the exhibition are photographs of @entity8 , @entity48 and @entity13
many have *curious* histories , such as @entity273 , named after a 13th century @entity139 mercenary
the history of @entity8 covers more than two *millennia* with the first bridge built by the @entity4
@entity8 was later used to display the heads of traitors beginning with @entity259 in 1305
