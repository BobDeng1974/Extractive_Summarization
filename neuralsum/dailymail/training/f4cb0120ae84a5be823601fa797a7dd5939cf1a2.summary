by @entity0 published : 19:18 est , 27 july 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 28 july 2013 the @entity1 has launched a discreet campaign to ensure that prince @entity3 , prince @entity4 – and eventually baby @entity5 – inherit her role as @entity7			1
contrary to popular belief , the position does not extend to her successors			0
however , the @entity1 wants @entity11 to use a summit later this year to urge @entity14 leaders to change its rules so that her son , grandson and great - grandson take on the role when they become @entity21			1
born to rule : the @entity23 and @entity24 with their new born son , @entity5 of @entity26 the @entity27 believes @entity14 joy over the birth of @entity5 provides the ideal opportunity to guarantee the @entity32 monarchy does not lose its most prominent international platform when the @entity1 dies			1
her position as @entity7 was secured in the ‘ @entity36 ’ of 1949 , three years before she acceded to the @entity38			0
but , crucially , it did not state her heirs would take over			0
technically , it is up to the leaders of the 54 countries that make up the @entity14 to decide who will replace her as @entity7			1
but if the @entity48 initiative succeeds , the job would be secured for future @entity32 @entity21 when the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) takes place in @entity51 in november			0
international platform : the @entity1 wants her son @entity3 and subsequent monarchs to also be @entity7 a pledge at the summit that @entity3 and his heirs would succeed the @entity1 as @entity7 would avoid nations such as @entity59 and @entity60 – where there are vocal republican movements – using the meeting as an opportunity to demand a break in the link with the @entity67			2
evidence of covert diplomatic manoeuvres by the @entity48 is revealed in a subtle change on the website of the @entity73 - based @entity72 , the organisation ’s official hq			0
until recently the section on the ‘ @entity7 ’ stated that although the @entity1 occupied the position , it ‘ does not pass automatically to her heir ’			2
good timing : the @entity1 has chosen a moment while the royal family is at its most popular to launch her campaign this has been quietly removed in recent weeks			2
@entity87 insiders say this is part of a discreet campaign			0
@entity3 will attend the @entity49 alongside mr @entity11			0
the @entity1 will miss the biennial event for the first time because of prince @entity93 ’s ill - health and controversy over staging it in @entity51 , which has a poor human rights record			2
‘ it would be awful if , when the @entity1 dies , there was a political wrangle in the @entity14 over whether @entity3 should follow her , ’ said one diplomat			1
‘ removing the reference on the @entity72 website to the fact the @entity32 @entity21 does not automatically get the @entity14 job was a clear signal			0
there are one of two ambitious , rather distasteful figures in the @entity14 who could use this uncertainty to try to grab the job vacated by the @entity1			1
‘ if @entity11 asks @entity14 leaders to secure the role for little @entity5 , few could object			1
’ critics say appointing a hereditary figure to lead the @entity14 undermines its efforts to spread democracy			1
but supporters say it emphasises the @entity14 ’s character as a ‘ unique family of nations ’ rather than a political , @entity124 organisation .			0

it is currently up to leaders of the @entity14 who will be next head
the @entity1 wants to make the title hereditary
