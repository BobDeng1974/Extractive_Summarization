two antique ships are set to be repainted with special ' dazzle ' camouflage as part of an art project marking the 100th anniversary of the @entity5			1
modern artists are designing a unique pattern for the vessels , which are currently docked in @entity9 and @entity10 after being taken out of active service			1
the initiative is part of a series of projects announced yesterday which will commemorate the centenary of the conflict 's outbreak in 1914			2
camouflage : @entity21 painted with a dazzle design in 1918 in order to disguise it from the enemy project : the @entity26 , a pilot cutter now in dry dock in @entity10 , will be repainted in dazzle art : @entity32 president , moored on the @entity33 in @entity9 , will also be repainted the dazzle ships are based on the paint used to disguise @entity37 and @entity38 warships during the @entity39			1
they were decorated with black and white jagged lines in a bid to make it more difficult for the enemy to work out their exact position and the direction they were travelling			0
the @entity26 , a pilot cutter now in dry dock in @entity10 , will be repainted by @entity50 artist @entity49 and unveiled in june this year			2
another artist yet to be announced will paint the @entity32 president , which is moored on the @entity33 near the @entity53 in @entity9			2
historic : @entity55 , an aircraft carrier , was one of the many ships painted in dazzle in order to make it harder for the @entity61 to determine their speed and direction of travel inspiration : steamship @entity66 , built in 1918 in @entity68 , was painted in a dazzle pattern dazzle camouflage , used during the @entity5 , was an example of the collaboration of art with national defence			1
inspired by cubist and vorticist artworks , painter @entity75 proposed painting ships with jagged stripes and lines in a bid to cut down on the number lost to the @entity61			1
although the camouflage did not actually disguise the ships , it distorted their shape when seen from far away			0
this made it harder for the @entity61 to work out how fast they were sailing and in which direction , reducing the accuracy of their guns			2
a total of 2,000 ships from the @entity95 and the @entity38 fleet were repainted in a dazzle design in 1917 and 1918 , with each one being unique so the @entity61 could not identify classes of ship by their markings			1
the camouflage fell out of favour by the 1940s , because it was rendered useless by the introduction of radar			0
the president was previously painted in dazzle camouflage during the @entity5 , when it was deployed as a submarine hunter tracking down @entity61 u-boats			1
14 - 18 now , the charity responsible for the project , said : ' these eye - catching additions to the dockside scenery remind local people and visitors of the crucial role ships played in the country ’s wartime survival			0
' dazzle camouflage was originally inspired by modernist artworks , making it a poignant choice for the national art project			1
the camouflaged ships would have been an everday site during the @entity5 , when they were docked around @entity130 in between missions			1
other initiatives announced yesterday include a letter - writing project and an hour 's darkness across the @entity130 on the night of the centenary			0
the @entity140 project is inspired by then foreign secretary sir @entity142 ’s remark at the outbreak of the war that : ‘ the lamps are going out all over @entity146 , we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime			0
’ people will be asked to turn off their lights and replace them with either a candle or a specially commissioned digital light which will be available to download for free			0
unique : each dazzle pattern was different and no two ships looked the same ; the @entity154 is pictured in 1919 carrying @entity155 a commemorative late - night prom at the @entity157 will see @entity61 composer @entity158 and the @entity159 perform a 40 - minute work featuring verse by writers including @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			2
members of the public have been invited to write a ' letter to an unknown soldier ' , inspired by a statue at @entity171 of a serviceman reading a letter			0
project director @entity174 said : ' we are commissioning some of the world 's leading artists to respond to the events of the @entity5 and the wider social political , cultural and scientific developments of the period			0
' i am particularly delighted about the way artists have responded to the brief and the wonderful enthusiasm our cultural organisations have shown in their support for the programme			0

ships docked in @entity10 and @entity9 will be repainted with the design used during the @entity5 to hide them from the @entity61
the *technique* was inspired by modernist artworks
a series of artistic projects are planned to mark the 100th anniversary of war
