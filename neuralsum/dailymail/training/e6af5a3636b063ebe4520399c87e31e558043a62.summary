@entity6 , 24 , had taken advantage of fine weather in @entity9 to take to the skies on a paramotor - which looks like a giant fan strapped to his back			1
but mr @entity6 , a plasterer from @entity15 , had n't reckoned with a fierce gust of crosswind which sent him hurtling towards a copse of tall trees			1
scroll down for helmet - cam video stuck ! @entity21 @entity6 found himself entangled 32ft up a tree and had to be rescued by more than 40 emergency workers in a two - hour operation daredevil : @entity6 , 24 , seen just before his collision with a tree			1
he had been taking advantage of good weather conditions to go paramotoring , a sport similar to paragliding rescue : @entity6 , from @entity15 , came into difficulty at @entity33 in @entity9 when strong crosswinds sent him hurtling towards a copse of trees mr @entity6 , who only took up the hobby earlier this year , remembered his training and tried to gain speed			1
but he clipped the top of the trees and was smacked in the face by a branch			0
seconds later , he was entangled in the foliage and was left dangling in the top of the tree before being spotted by a dog walker			0
it took more than 40 emergency workers two hours to bring him down from the tree , at @entity33 in @entity15			1
remarkably , mr @entity6 managed to use his mobile phone to call his family during the rescue - but they thought he was joking and refused to believe him			2
the ordeal was recorded on mr @entity6 's helmet - cam , which had been intended to capture the stunning views of the countryside			2
trapped : @entity6 ( circled left ) ended up several feet beneath his paramotor equipment after clipping the top of the trees , causing a branch to strike him in the face and make his become tangled in the branches video : head cam time ! see the crash from the @entity67 ... emergency rescue : fire engines at the scene of the accident			1
his parachute is visible wrapped in branches in the copse of trees mr @entity6 said : ' the initial reaction was , ' i 'm going to hit the trees ' , but with the training your reaction is to almost do the opposite so instead of slowing down you go fast			1
' i was two feet away from missing them			0
i found it quite amusing			0
' i could n't get a mobile signal up the tree at first but once i did i phoned my family who were together at the time			0
' i told them i was surrounded by firemen and ambulances and i was stuck up a tree			2
' they all laughed and did n't believe me , and carried on with what they were doing			0
it was n't until after 3pm they called and wondered where i was			0
' long way down ! @entity6 can be seen clinging on to the foliage as he tried to untangle his parachute which got stuck about 30ft up the tree exciting hobby : little , a plasterer by trade , is used to spectacular views of the @entity108 landscape when he goes up with his paramotor busy : two fire appliances , police and ambulances were involved in the emergency rescue operation paramotors work by the pilot running into the wind carrying a parachute and when it catches the motor strapped to their back carries them upwards			1
two fire appliances attended the scene along with a specialist rescue team , police and ambulance services			0
luckily , mr @entity6 escaped with just a black eye and some scratches from his first accident			2
he added : ' surprisingly none of the equipment is damaged apart from three props on the back of the engine			2
it could have been worse however it 's such good fun i ca n't wait to get back up there			0
' so long as you are being sensible , flying in the right conditions and have had plenty of training then generally it 's safe			0
