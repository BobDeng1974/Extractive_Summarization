by @entity0 in a cloud of smoke and with a thunderous blast three historic towers were demolished today after dominating an @entity7 town 's skyline for more than four decades			1
the three southern towers of @entity10 power station in @entity11 were brought down by more than 180kg of explosives in a matter of seconds			1
hundreds of locals are thought to have defied the guidance issued by power company @entity17 to stay away from the site and watch the demolition via a webcam livestream			1
moments later , 180kg of explosives sent them crashing to the ground the three cooling towers collapse in the explosion			1
the demolition was carried out in the early hours of the morning due to health and safety concerns the incredible images show the three cooling towers , each approximately 100m tall , collapsing simultaneously in the early hours of the morning the towers had been on the @entity37 site for more than 40 years , but the controlled explosions which destroyed them down took only 15 seconds the decision to demolish the towers in the early hours of the morning angered some locals , with a petition to change the timing gaining more than 3,000 signatures			1
the town council had also expressed its disappointment but npower said the timeslot between 3am and 5am had been chosen on health and safety grounds			2
the time took into account the risk of people getting too close to the explosion , and the impact of the dust cloud on local roads and a nearby rail line			2
warning sirens were sounded 15 and then 10 minutes before the explosion at 5am			2
@entity63 was constructed from 1964 to 1968 at a cost of Â£ 104million			0
the combined coal and oil power plant featured a chimney 200m tall and cooling towers approximately 100m high			1
controversial even when proposed , a ' yes ' vote to proceed with its construction was successful because of the number of jobs it was expected to bring to the region			0
in later years the power plant was the focus of several environmental protests			0
in 2006 and 2009 , @entity80 protestors invaded the station , chaining themselves to conveyor belts and climbing the chimneys - on one occasion , even painting ' @entity85 ' across it			0
its 2013 closure came about due to @entity90 directives to reduce carbon emissions and @entity17 declined to update it with power generation technology that would allow it to continue			0
during the build - up to the explosion # @entity96 was trending on @entity97 , and one @entity11 resident said : ' this has got ta be @entity37 's most momentous occasion since we won the fa vase			1
' as many as 1,500 people gathered at nearby @entity105 to watch the action unfold , the @entity103 reported in a liveblog on its website			0
for those who chose to watch the demolition online there were some technological gripes			2
one local tweeted : ' the demolition cam is very intermittent ... what are the odds it 's offline at the crucial moment ? # @entity96			1
' the coal - fired power station ceased generating in march last year after dominating the skyline around the town since 1970 , with the neighbouring gas - fired @entity121 continuing			1
the towers ' appearance was not universally appreciated with many people finding them an eyesore , although many on @entity97 expressed sadness the towers were gone			1
' boom ! there goes another piece of my childhood , ' one wrote			0
another said : ' ca n't believe that 3 of the @entity37 towers will be demolished tonight			2
a beacon that showed some of us were nearly home			0
' @entity141 wrote : ' sad to say goodbye to these beauties # @entity96 - iconic @entity11 landmark			1
' following the demolition some of those who had watched it described it as ' epic ' , ' pretty dramatic to watch ' and ' strangely emotional '			2
@entity150 , managing director of specialist demolition firm , @entity150 & @entity151 said it had been job well done			0
he tweeted : ' @entity153 well done to all involved			0
thank you to all the locals			0
i hope you enjoyed it			0
