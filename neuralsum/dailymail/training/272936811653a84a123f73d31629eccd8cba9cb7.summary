by @entity1 reporter published : 12:50 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 15:17 est , 3 december 2012 a @entity3 blogger has warned @entity5 dissidents who flee to @entity6 they are ' cheats and pawns ' and could face a sticky end			2
@entity10 was writing following the death in @entity6 of 44 year old whistleblower @entity12			1
businessman @entity12 had been assisting @entity14 prosecutors in a case of suspected high level money laundering by @entity5 officials , prompting fears that an ' invisible ' poison could have been used to kill him			1
sticky end : pro-kremlin blogger @entity10 ( right ) has warned @entity5 dissidents who flee to @entity6 they are ' cheats and pawns ' following the death of whistleblower @entity24 ( left ) in @entity25 last month the case is similar to that of @entity5 dissident @entity28 , who died after drinking tea poisoned with radioactive polonium six years ago in @entity31			1
@entity12 was found dead outside his @entity25 home last month and in - depth toxicological tests are being carried out			1
in his latest blog , mr @entity10 warned that those who betray @entity5 become ' pawns in a complicated geopolitical game			1
and they die because they do not understand it '			0
he suggested that @entity28 was murdered not by those acting for the @entity5 secret services but by exiles in @entity6			0
' this is what happened to @entity28 who was killed by polonium according to an ‘ order from @entity48 ’ as our @entity51 ' partners ' say , but more likely he was poisoned by thallium salt , ' he said , pointing the finger at a well - known exile			2
an author and journalist , @entity10 is behind the ' @entity58 ' which goes to ' people who lie about , slander and vilify @entity5 '			1
on the latest mysterious death , @entity10 wrote that ' three years ago according to the best traditions of @entity5 cheats , @entity62 escaped to @entity51 and applied for asylum '			1
he then gave evidence to @entity14 prosecutors against @entity5 officials			1
in a sinister phrase , @entity10 said : ' in such situations the death is rarely occasional			1
' @entity6 's @entity72 : the coach @entity73 , home of the @entity5 supergrass @entity77 , who was found collapsed and dying on the luxury estate he urged potential whistleblowers to keep quiet and stay at home			0
' it is not just honourable to the honest patriot to love your @entity85 more than personal selfish interests , but it is also very good for your health			0
' one comment darkly warns @entity5 : ' here are the best traditions of @entity6 intelligence for you			0
' @entity12 was a fit , energetic businessman with no history of medical problems , when , it seems , he simply dropped dead in the one - acre grounds of his seven - bedroom home			1
yet exactly how he died remains shrouded in mystery			2
his body was discovered by a member of his staff in the early evening			0
he had last been seen out jogging that morning and was still in his running gear when he was found			0
a post-mortem examination was carried out , which was inconclusive and forensic experts are carrying out further tests for traces of poison			1
amid growing fears among associates that this wealthy individual was the victim of a sophisticated professional assassin , forensic experts are working to identify any lethal substance in the dead man ’s organs or bloodstream			2
the extra tests were ordered — following a routine autopsy — after @entity25 police were informed that the dead man had fled from @entity5 to @entity6 three years ago and had turned supergrass against members of a feared @entity5 crime syndicate			1
the coach @entity73 , home of @entity5 supergrass @entity77 , can be seen at the top left of this picture of millionaires ' luxury private estate , @entity134 , in @entity135 , @entity25 following the death it emerged that @entity12 had been warned via a @entity5 police official that his name was on a hit list discovered in the possession of a known @entity143 hitman in @entity5 , who had details of his former addresses			1
the death comes six months after another @entity5 businessman was gunned down in broad daylight outside @entity31 ’s @entity149 when a hitman sprayed him with bullets			2
one theory is that the businessman was shot because he knew too much about a 2009 gun attack on a @entity5 banker in @entity156			0
@entity28 had fled to @entity6 with evidence that gangs linked to @entity5 ’s leadership were plotting the murder of @entity161 , an oligarch who had fallen out with president @entity162			0
he fell ill after meeting a @entity164 officer and his associate at the @entity166 in @entity31 ’s @entity167			0
exclusive : @entity134 , in @entity135 , is one of the most secure roads in @entity6 and boasts many multimillion - pound properties , in which celebrities including @entity173 and @entity174 have lived @entity177 ’ poison , polonium - 210 is substance considered to be 250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide			2
toxicologists estimate that a dose the size of a grain of salt would be fatal			0
the substance used in the @entity28 case was traced back to a @entity5 nuclear plant			2
if polonium or another toxin is found to have been used in the latest case , experts say it would not have been difficult to administer the substance : for example , a food delivery bound for the victim ’s home could have been intercepted and tampered with			2
the effects of polonium can take hours or days to become apparent — though the poison can trigger a heart attack — and only specialised tests can discover traces of the substance , which rapidly diminish after death			1
what was particularly chilling in the wake of @entity28 ’s murder was the refusal of president @entity162 to hand over the prime suspect — the @entity164 man who was at the @entity31 hotel on the day in question			0
when @entity212 went to @entity156 last year and demanded the suspect be sent to @entity6 , he was told bluntly : ‘ that will never happen , no matter what the circumstances			0
’ now , with a @entity219 mp and a clutch of former @entity221 expressing increasing concern about @entity5 criminals operating in @entity6 , diplomatic relations between @entity156 and @entity31 could plunge to an icy new low if the death in @entity134 proves to be murder			0
exclusive : @entity134 , in @entity135 , is one of the most secure roads in @entity6 and boasts many multimillion - pound properties , in which celebrities including @entity173 and @entity174 have lived in the coming days , all eyes will be on the results of the forensics being carried out at a @entity25 police lab. toxicology specialists have been brought in to study blood and tissue samples after detectives learned the identity of the dead man			1
certainly , @entity244 , a high - profile @entity5 anti-corruption campaigner , believes the latest death bears all the hallmarks of a professional hit			1
‘ he died at the age of 44 , which in general is not typical , and there were no signs of violent death			0
well , @entity28 did n’t have them either			0
’ @entity12 could have died from natural causes , but there is much in his past that points to a more complex — and concerning — story			2
he fled to @entity6 with his young wife @entity260 , after falling out with members of a criminal network thought to include corrupt members of the @entity5 police , tax office , judiciary and government			0
at the time of his death , he was providing information to @entity271 , a wealthy @entity6 businessman who was the victim of the same crime network , which he says colluded in the hijacking of his @entity156 investment company in order to carry out a massive fraud			0
@entity271 , 48 , had been contacted by @entity12 in the summer of 2010			2
‘ he provided us with documents proving the involvement of named @entity5 government officials in the fraud against my company , ’ @entity271 has said			0
these explosive papers revealed names of those involved in the tax scam , including details of how they had used the cash they made to buy a £ 15 million @entity156 estate , as well as multi-million - pound properties in @entity295 and to set up a @entity14 bank account containing millions			1
many close to the case believe this revelation cost @entity12 his life .			1

mystery surrounds death of @entity12 who had no history of medical problems , when , it seems , he simply dropped dead

authorities still *awaiting* the results of in - depth toxicological tests are being carried out
