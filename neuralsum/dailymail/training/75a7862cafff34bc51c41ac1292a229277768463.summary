most impalas run for their lives at the sight of a leopard but this plucky youngster snuck in for an affectionate embrace instead			0
the unlikely friendship between the hunter and its prey was captured in the @entity9 in @entity10			1
the impala nuzzles the big cat 's nose and mouth , and even when its new friend gets a little rough , it shows no signs of running off			1
he said : ' in all my years of being a game ranger i have never seen such an encounter , nor do i ever expect to see a repeat of it again			1
' i felt amazed and honoured to see such a rare and unexplainable sighting			2
' the impala at no stage showed any signs of distress or fear			0
every time the leopard would playfully interact with the baby impala , it would return to the leopard and either sniff its face or push its head against the leopard 's face			2
' a few times the impala would jump away from the leopard and , true to cat form , the leopard would pull it back closer with its claws			2
' mr @entity35 said young leopards sometimes play with their prey due to a lack of killing experience , and believes this may explain the odd encounter			0
i 'm just trying to scratch : the leopard uses its rear paw to scratch its neck as the friendly impala closes in eye spy : something catches the leopards attention to the left as the impala looks on game ranger @entity35 who spotted the encounter said in all his years on the job he had never spotted such as unlikely friendship and said he never expects to ' see a repeat of it again ' catch me if you can : cuddle time over , the impala decides to stretch its legs , which intrigues the leopard you 've got no chance : as the impala gathers some speed the big cat makes a hasty turn in pursuit two on one : another leopard joins the fun as the trio run together across a clearing in the park he added : ' although this appears to be play , only the leopard was actually playing and not the impala			1
' the impala rubbed faces with the leopard because it 's a newborn and does n't know any better			2
' the leopard could have been waiting for the baby 's mother to return and then kill her			0
' @entity35 , who works for @entity113 , says the amiable interaction lasted for an hour before the leopard lazily strolled into a bush , closely followed by the impala			0
down you go : the leopard places a paw on the impala 's back , gnetly nudging it to the ground meal mates : the impala looks set to become the big cats lunch , but the rough play is all in the name of fun just chilling : having had a run , the leopards and the impala take a rest , but @entity135 from @entity136 said while the pictures may suggest the leopards had made a friend , they were just doing what many big cats do , ' it is playing with its prey ' @entity135 , the senior project manager from @entity136 said : ' the leopard is just doing what leopards do and like many cats , it is playing with its prey			1
' i 've seen similar things before , when just like a domestic cat , which may bring a mouse home and play with i ) , this leopard is just playing around before the inevitable			1
' as much as it would be nice to think predator and prey became buddies , the instances of vegetarian leopards are non existent , so the end result is very likely to not have ended well for the @entity162			0
' it is not known what happened afterwards - but sadly it is likely the friendship only lasted until dinnertime .			0

the unlikely friendship was formed at @entity10 's @entity9
a game ranger said he was ' amazed and honoured ' to have seen the union
a leopard expert said the big cat was simply ' playing with its prey '
