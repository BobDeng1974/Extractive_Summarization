@entity7 from @entity8 , @entity9 , set up a @entity11 page for her daughter @entity12 following the youngster 's diagnosis in 2014 to keep loved ones updated about her progress			1
however she was horrified when she learned the pictures were copied by a stranger and used on @entity11 and @entity20 accounts set up under a false name - @entity21			1
treatment : @entity7 set up a @entity11 page for her daughter @entity12 ( pictured ) following the youngster 's leukemia diagnosis in 2014 to keep loved ones updated about her progress			1
she later found out some of the pictures had been stolen and used on social media under a different name fake : the @entity20 handle , @ @entity30 ( right ) , had more than 340 followers , and featured 38 photos of little @entity34 , including one of her dressed as @entity36 from @entity38 's @entity37			1
it has now been taken down according to @entity43 a child cancer advocate who was a member of @entity12 's @entity11 group found the images and immediately alerted the family			1
the @entity20 handle , @ hopeforcooper , had over 340 followers , and featured 38 photos of @entity12			2
last week the @entity48 learned that the account had been removed from the site			0
one person under the name @ sophiabenge _ claimed that ' @entity21 ' was her cousin when she uploaded the picture			0
many users commenting on the photo suggested the profile was fake			0
the account however is still active			0
following the discovery , the @entity48 kept searching the internet for other evidence , but could n't find any			0
they also found no crowdfunding sites using @entity12 's images , suggesting they had not been used to generate financial benefits			1
she told the station : ' i share pictures on there because i have family members and friends that live across the nation that want to follow @entity12 ’s story			1
' in the group there ’s pictures of her in the bathtub at the hospital , visitations , her dressing up as @entity80 – pretty much doing normal , everyday things			2
' they were our pictures , but someone had taken them and made a whole new story with them			2
' that ’s my child			0
it ’s not only wrong to pretend someone else ’s kid is your own , but you ’re claiming to go through something that 's not even true			0
