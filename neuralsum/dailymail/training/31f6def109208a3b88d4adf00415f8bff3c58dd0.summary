the monarch began yesterday ’s televised address by talking about a sculpture of a man and woman embracing by @entity41 called @entity42 , casts of which can be found in @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity29			1
she said : ‘ the benefits of reconciliation were clear to see when i visited @entity29 in june			2
while my tour of the set of @entity52 may have gained most attention , my visit to the @entity10 will remain vividly in my mind			0
what was once a prison during @entity58 is now a place of hope and fresh purpose ... a reminder of what is possible when people reach out to one another , rather like the couple in the sculpture			0

resplendent in a purple @entity98 dress , the @entity3 recorded her message next to a table displaying portraits of her grandparents @entity103 and @entity104 – the latter of whom passed down the diamond and pearl brooch pinned to her shoulder			2

the @entity3 said : ‘ without any instruction or command , the shooting stopped			2
’ she later added : ‘ sometimes it seems that reconciliation stands little chance in the face of war and discord			0
