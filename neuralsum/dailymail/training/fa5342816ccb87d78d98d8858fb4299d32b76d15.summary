by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 16:00 est , 27 october 2012 i ’m from @entity2 in the @entity3 , a friendly place where people smile , chat and even wink			2
so you ’ll understand my confusion when i first arrived in @entity8 , a land where social mixing seems impossible without beer			1
i love the people , the politeness and the scones			2
but when it comes to flirting , you @entity8 have much to learn			1
as a social anthropologist , i ’ve spent more than a decade looking at how men and women interact and i recently completed a four - country comparison			1
much to learn : @entity8 need to take notes from across the pond or end up going home alone at the end of the night , according to research on the basis of what i found , i ’m sorry to say flirting is all too rare in @entity8 – and when it does take place , it ’s likely to fail			1
@entity31 get right down to business ; @entity33 take refuge in ornate but time - proven ritual ; but here people just give up and go home			2
@entity8 ’s problems start with men			1
protocol dictates that men approach women			1
the guys know this , yet it ’s clear they ’re horrified at the idea of rejection			2
‘ perhaps i am intruding upon her and her friends , ’ they think			2
‘ she might not welcome the interruption ! ’ @entity31 men can cope with rejection : they laugh about it with friends , denigrate the girl , buy another drink , and move on			1
but men here seem swallowed up in despair			1
@entity8 women agree that the man should make the first approach			1
but women here , too , are at fault , because they give no clear signs of encouragement to the few men who dare			1
@entity72 : according to statistics @entity8 men are particularly bad at flirting and most are unable to tell when a woman is flirting with him what @entity8 women count as obvious eye contact is , to men , no more than a blink			1
when asked how they let a man know they are interested , women say ‘ i look at them ; i do n’t need to do anything physical			2
the fact i ’m listening makes them feel important , ’ or ‘ i do obvious body language , like pointing my knee in his direction while we chat			2
’ such gestures seem to be lost on the intended flirtees			2
it is no surprise that only 35 per cent of @entity8 men can tell if a woman is flirting with them			1
@entity8 men , it seems , like a good deal of reassurance			1
‘ it ’s best when women do something deliberate , ’ said one man			2
‘ @entity104 put their hand on my knee or just tell me			2
’ @entity8 women are slightly better placed : 57 per cent think they are good at spotting flirtation			1
yet it is the smallest percentage in the survey			2
in @entity111 , 53 per cent of men and 95 per cent of women think they know what ’s happening			1
@entity8 men are expected to make the first move , yet a full 30 per cent say they ’d never approach anyone in a flirtatious way			1
perhaps , as i suspect , @entity8 men and women approach people they ’ve known for a long time or , better still , to whom they have been introduced			1
flirt - phobia is n’t limited to a class or social group			2
it afflicts even the rich and beautiful : i was recently asked to help made in @entity125 stars @entity126 and @entity127			0
despite their good looks and confidence , they still needed a few pointers on meeting the opposite sex			0
i recommend lessons from abroad			0
in @entity31 nothing is left to doubt			0
yes , women prefer the man to make the first move			0
but if he does n’t , she makes the running herself			0
and if that fails , she just moves on , quickly			0
in @entity111 a complex game is carried out under the guise of serious conversation			0
neither party will make genuine feelings obvious			0
if they do , they have ‘ lost ’			0
glam help : @entity148 's made in @entity125 stars @entity126 and @entity127 both received some helpful tips on how to flirt women in particular must keep feelings private , often even avoiding eye contact , lest they be thought ‘ easy ’			0
it ’s amazing that anything happens at all			0
but it does , because men and women are both au fait with the rules of engagement and keep to them			1
in gender - equal @entity163 , women feel free to make their interest clear			0
i ’m not sure walking up to a man and saying , ‘ @entity167 now ’ counts as flirting			1
in @entity8 , i ’ve seen men and women talk for hours to people they do n’t fancy because they do n’t wish to give offence			1
and the result is stultifying			0
@entity126 and @entity127 listened to advice and accept the need for a more direct approach			0
for all his confidence on tv , @entity127 feels a bit inhibited in reality			0
@entity126 now believes in flirting more often and more openly			1
she even got a date during filming			0
after 13 years in @entity8 , i like it so much i ’ve taken citizenship			1
but when it comes to meeting the opposite sex , someone needs to say something			0
so , here it is : if you ’re interested in a person , tell them ; if not , move on gently with a smile			0
it ’s to your advantage			0
as the golfer @entity195 famously said : ‘ the more i practise , the luckier i get			0
’ the @entity196 , by @entity0 , is published by @entity197 , priced at £ 12.99 ( paperback ) and £ 5.98 ( @entity199 )			0
@entity0 appears on made in @entity125 on @entity200 on november 19 .			0
