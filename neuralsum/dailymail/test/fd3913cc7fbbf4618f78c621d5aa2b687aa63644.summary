two dropped points wo n’t cause too much damage to @entity3 ’s title defence — but this draw will have offered encouragement to @entity6 ahead of next weekend ’s @entity8 semi-final against the champions			1
while @entity3 have relentlessly marched towards the title , the shine has come off @entity13 ’s season in recent weeks , with manager @entity14 struggling to find a solution to the problem posed by the sale of top scorer @entity18 to @entity19 in january			2
@entity21 @entity20 has been recruited as a replacement and , although he does not appear to have the same natural predatory instincts as the @entity25 international , he did pop up in the right place to equalise @entity28 ’ early goal			1
@entity28 ( left ) fired @entity3 into an early lead in their encounter against @entity6 @entity28 runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling @entity3 supporters @entity28 ( right ) celebrates his third minute goal with his @entity3 team - mates , but the lead did not last long a further sign of the @entity39 ’ fortitude came with the way in which they absorbed the loss of goalkeeper @entity43 to a nasty knee injury but , in truth , neither side was able to play their favoured passing game thanks to the combination of a bobbly pitch and a strong wind			1
@entity3 last travelled here during their troubled and ultimately unsuccessful bid to qualify for the @entity54 group stages , with manager @entity55 making 10 changes to the team in the midst of a two - legged tie with @entity61 champions @entity60			1
names like ( @entity64 ) @entity63 , ( @entity65 ) @entity66 and ( @entity68 ) @entity67 featured on the team - sheet that day , with teenage @entity25 defender @entity70 having the dubious honour of match - winner , his own goal gifting @entity74 their 1 - 0 victory			0
with @entity3 eager to wrap up the title as quickly as possible , a victory was the priority this time and there were three changes to the team that beat @entity83 in midweek , @entity84 and @entity85 joining @entity28 in the starting line - up			1
@entity55 has taken to rotating his strikers of late and @entity28 immediately staked his claim with a clinical piece of forward play which had shades of the sort of goal he regularly scored for @entity94 en route to picking up the @entity97 title with the @entity99 club a couple of years ago			2
@entity20 ( left ) equalised for @entity6 from close range a minute after @entity28 scoring @entity101 ( left ) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for @entity6 against @entity3 @entity85 , restored to the team after suspension — and booked again on saturday — offered assistance by launching a long pass into the wind			1
the stiff breeze coming off the @entity111 was enough to give @entity28 the chance to beat @entity113 in a race for the ball			2
by the time the defender had got square , @entity28 had worked the ball onto his left foot and drilled an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards			2
with their team on such a poor run and struggling to score goals , the locals cringed — but @entity6 rallied and produced an impressive response			0
@entity20 may have shown little to suggest he can offset the loss of @entity18 ’s goals but he is a powerful specimen and this , clearly , was his type of occasion			0
before scoring , he had already given @entity133 a couple of bumps and he was there to punish the @entity137 for the goal			0
@entity133 did all he could to prevent the ball crossing the line when he blocked @entity142 ’s net - bound effort but @entity20 was there to jab home the finish from close range			1
few teams have the physicality to match @entity3 but @entity20 typifies the muscular streak that runs through @entity14 ’ team , with @entity113 , @entity151 , @entity113 , @entity152 and @entity153 all quite happy to mix it with the champions			1
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity43 was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against @entity3 @entity157 of @entity3 tackles @entity142 of @entity6 in saturday 's early @entity159 match in such circumstances , @entity3 turn to @entity85 , and the captain stepped up to the plate , breaking up play and showing a willingness to carry the ball forward from deep			1
he was the most impressive performer afield , yet his game was not without controversy as he picked up a yellow card for tumbling when tackled by @entity169 , a harsh sanction from referee @entity171 , who adjudged the contact insufficient to award a penalty			0
the @entity175 team had to overcome a more serious setback , however , when goalkeeper @entity43 went down in obvious discomfort after kicking clear as @entity179 moved in			0
there seemed no ill - intent in the @entity3 winger ’s challenge but @entity43 required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by @entity185			2
to his credit , the substitute produced impressive saves either side of half - time to tip over headers from @entity84 and @entity133			0
@entity13 dropped deeper as the game wore on , with @entity55 introducing @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 in a bid to force the issue			0
even so , it was @entity6 who came on strongly at the end			0
@entity201 and @entity152 flashed shots over , although ultimately there was nothing to test the capabilities of @entity206 in goal .			0

@entity28 gave @entity3 a third minute lead which lasted only 60 seconds
@entity20 levelled for @entity6 with a close - range finish
@entity3 failed to *unlock* the @entity6 defence again and had to take a point
