by @entity0 and @entity1 the former partner of a mother who was battered to death by her teenage son in a killing he copied from @entity7 , has today blamed horror films and violent games for his violent behaviour			1
@entity11 was just 14 when he hit mother @entity12 , 47 , seven times with a claw hammer at their detached @entity16 home			1
he then padded her body with paper , doused it in petrol and set fire to it in a bid to destroy evidence and commit the ‘ perfect murder ’			1
mrs @entity12 had to be identified using dental records			2
@entity12 , a former public schoolboy , who was jailed for life yesterday , had also been fascinated by violent video games rated 18 and dvds , including @entity30 and the @entity31 , since the age of eight			1
horrific : @entity11 , left , butchered his mum @entity33 , 47 , right , with a claw hammer as she slept after becoming obsessed with @entity7 killer @entity35 he watched the torture - themed film saw just hours before murdering @entity37 at their home in @entity40 , @entity41 , on @entity42 last year			1
today the 47 - year - old 's former partner , @entity43 said : ' i was quite disturbed at the things he had in his bedroom - the @entity48 movies , the @entity50 movies , the @entity31 movies , final destination			1
they are all 18 and beyond , and some would probably scare adults , let alone children			0
but he seemed to thrive on it			0
' it shocked me , and i said to @entity37 , " these are inappropriate for him "			0
he was only 13 at the time			0
violent obsession : @entity12 , a former public schoolboy , who was jailed for life yesterday , had also been fascinated by violent 18 + video games and dvds , including @entity30 , left , and the @entity31 , right , since the age of eight ' it must have had an impact because any normal thinking person would n't have done what he did unless he got something imprinted in his brain from what he watched , ' he added			1
mr @entity72 , @entity73 , also believes measures need to be put in place to prevent 18 rated films and video games being sold to young people			2
he added : ' the only thing i would like to see come out of all this is the fact that if the games and dvds are a contributing factor , which i 'm sure they are , then the people who sell them should be looking at themselves and saying , ' next time i sell one , make sure the people buying them are of the age to buy them '			0
shocking : a scene from @entity7 , with killer character @entity35 on the right ablaze : after killing his mother , @entity11 set fire to the modest family home in a bid to conceal her body @entity12 was ordered to be detained at @entity99 , with a recommendation he serve at least 16 years in custody before he is considered for release			1
a court heard the teenager rescued his younger brother and the family pet before fleeing from the burning house , telling police that mrs @entity12 , a @entity109 worker , had been killed by an intruder			1
but @entity12 was charged with murder after police discovered video footage on his computer of @entity7 ’s killer character , @entity35			2
last night @entity117 was forced to defend the soap ’s ‘ pre-watershed ’ storylines , which have become increasingly lurid in the past couple of years			0
influenced : @entity11 was obsessed with the @entity7 killer @entity121 , played by actor @entity122 @entity123 heard @entity12 was ‘ obsessed ’ with @entity124 – who battered a woman with a hammer before leaving her body in the wreckage of a tram crash to cover up his crime – and stored files relating to the plot on his computer			1
when police examined the rest of the hard drive they discovered he had searched for web pages about ‘ people who get away with murder in shows ’			0
he posted violent scenes from television soap @entity145 on @entity147 and had a fixation with crime drama @entity149			0
he also penned a soap opera - style plot in which he fantasised about a character called @entity11 killing ‘ @entity154 ’ , his mother			1
a source close to the case told the @entity157 : ‘ he comes across as being very mature but there is a distinct lack of emotion			0
if he was an adult he could be considered a psychopath			0
’ the product of a broken home , @entity12 had been obsessed with horror films since the age of eight and watched the gruesome saw 3d movie hours before the murder			1
he was convicted of his mother ’s murder in february following a two - week trial , but it was only after his sentencing yesterday that mr @entity174 lifted reporting restrictions which prevented him from being named			1
sentencing @entity12 to life with a minimum of 16 years for the ‘ senseless and grotesque killing ’ , the judge said the murder involved a high degree of planning , and @entity12 remained ‘ extremely dangerous ’			2
during his trial , the jury were told he was a ‘ young man who immersed himself in a fantasy world ; fantasy words he wrote , television drama , films he accessed by the internet and other internet sites ’			0
@entity191 : the remains of @entity12 's bedroom following the blaze caused by her son murder weapon : the lump hammer recovered from the @entity198 home and used by @entity11 prosecutor @entity200 added : ‘ the boundaries between real life and fiction became very , very tragically blurred			1

he said the man threw a hammer at him before fleeing and that he then found his mother ’s body on the floor of her burning bedroom			1
he said he panicked and fled with his brother and their dog			0
@entity12 was charged two days after the killing			2
in an outburst at the secure unit he was remanded to soon after , he threatened to ‘ kill ’ a fellow patient , ‘ like i killed my mum ’			2
he denied murder , offering to admit manslaughter on the basis that he snapped after being branded a ‘ f * * * * * * freak ’ by his mother			0
prosecutors refused to accept the plea and @entity12 will begin his sentence in a young offenders ’ institution			2
@entity12 ’s father @entity238 , a successful businessman , separated from his mother in 2005 , shortly after the birth of their other child , a boy who is now six			1
until then , @entity12 had attended @entity242 , a @entity41 preparatory school which closed last year , and @entity244 , a private boys ’ school			2
but financial pressures meant that following his parents ’ separation , @entity12 was sent to a @entity252 state school , where he failed to settle			2
in 2010 , he was referred to a school counsellor after telling pupils his tie , which he named ‘ @entity258 ’ , was trying to hurt him			0

’ @entity7 has been nicknamed ‘ the most violent place in @entity275 ’ , with ten characters killed off in the past two years			0
a tram disaster in december 2010 took the lives of four characters , while rapist @entity279 was murdered last month			0
