a school netball team have been banned after reaching the national finals of a tournament - because of a 10p debt			1
@entity6 's under - 16s and under - 18s teams made their way through county and regional heats earlier this year , but as the girls trained for the upcoming national finals , they were told they had been disqualified			1
the private girls ' school pays an annual subscription to be affiliated to @entity14 and enter the competition , open to all schools			1
the under 18 netball team of @entity18 in @entity19 , with student @entity20 holding a 10 pence piece - the root of their dispute with @entity14 the under 18s , pictured and the under 16 netball teams of @entity6 , reached the national finals of a schools tournament , but have been banned because they underpaid on their subscription for the 2011/2012 they paid £ 24 of the £ 24.10 fee and were put on a debtors list without their knowledge			1
this meant they were not sent an invoice to pay their subscription for 2012/13			0
once staff found out about the outstanding money , the school paid up			2
despite appeals over the ban , @entity14 have refused to back down , meaning the girls can not fight for the title at next month 's finals in @entity45 , @entity46			1
headmistress @entity47 said : ' it all seems very petty to me			0
we have always paid our subscriptions for all the different sports played here			0
' we were n't made aware of the small underpayment and we did n't get any further bills - either about the 10p or the fee for affiliation to @entity14 the next year			1
' it was only when two teams reached the finals that we were told about the problem			0
' mrs @entity47 said : ' we paid straight away once we found out			0
it was only raised once we reached the finals , that 's when we were told we were disqualified			2
' i guess they make extra checks before the finals but we have paid and it 's very unfair on the girls			1
' ' our pe teachers are some of the busiest staff in the school and because they did n't receive a bill , the payment was not made			2
' we made a mistake and we did everything we could to rectify it immediately			0
headteacher @entity47 said her students were ' very upset ' after @entity14 refused to let them compete in the national finals after they settled their debt ' all of this has happened because of an unpaid 10p			1
the girls are very upset - they 've trained a lot and they reached the finals			0
' mrs @entity47 said : ' they 've been able to compete so far , i guess technically they were not supposed to have but we did n't know at the time			0
' yes we made a mistake , but we paid at the earliest opportunity and they should take that into account			2
it feels like the girls are being unfairly penalised for something that is not their fault			0
' the school 's @entity98 , @entity100 , was named @entity14 's @entity101 in 2009			1
mrs @entity47 added : ' @entity100 is a coach to the girls and she 's a netball fanatic			0
' she is so disappointed and hopes something can be done before march			0
' the school also won the sporting body 's @entity106 in 2010 to acknowledge the number of times its teams had reached the finals			1
mrs @entity47 said : ' we 've hosted competitions for @entity14 for free before and two of our staff are due to go on a training course with them			2
@entity14 said @entity6 was the only school not to pay their annual subscriptions properly ' they had to give our school 's affiliation number and that all seemed to go through fine			1
' a spokesperson for @entity14 said : ' @entity14 has eligibility criteria for its @entity122			0
" this includes schools responsibility to affiliate to @entity14 prior to the start of the competition			0
' @entity6 failed to affiliate in accordance with these time scales and therefore it is with much regret that @entity14 was unable to accept their entry into the @entity135			1
' all other entrants to the @entity135 adhered to @entity14 's affiliation process			2

@entity6 's under 18s and under 16s made the finals
but they had underpaid last *season* 's fees by 10p and not paid for this year
@entity14 refuses to back down over ban after school settles debt
