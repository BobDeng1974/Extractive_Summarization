@entity0 needed a tide of energy to supress @entity3 in brutal conditions and he will now need to summon up another one if he is to stay alive in the @entity6			1
a grand slam rematch with @entity8 in the quarter finals was the reward for the colossal physical effort he put in to defeat the @entity13 7 - 5 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 in two hours and 35 minutes and claim his first win against a top ten player this season			1
@entity0 needed to rage at himself – and occasionally his team – as he skilfully fought back to claim the second set in one of his most animated performances since returning from back surgery in january			2
' it was extremely tough , windy and humid , ' he said			0
' the first two sets were very tough and mentally quite draining , and the third set could have got away			0
luckily @entity3 missed a few serves at the end			2
' i 've had some long matches against @entity8 and i hope i can play to my top level			2
if i do that i will have a chance			0
' he will welcome a day 's rest before what is sure to be a night match on wednesday			0
it will be their first meeting since history was made at @entity51 last year , with memories also of beating him at @entity54 in 2012 , and the @entity55 will not be as generous with the unforced errors as @entity3 was			2
@entity57 : the @entity59 no 1 won the first set 7 - 5 on @entity28 to take command of the match frustration : @entity3 held a break of serve in both the second and third sets but lost them both the world no 10 is the kind who hits both hot streaks and despondent lulls , and we saw both on monday			1
he defeated @entity0 in their last meeting at the recent @entity75 when the @entity76 wasted a 3 - 1 lead in the deciding set , but this time there was no mistake			1
by the time they walked on court during the steaming heat of @entity84 afternoon , @entity8 was steadily completing his business , defeating @entity86 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4			1
against a tricky opponent it was not quite the cakewalk the world no 1 had previously enjoyed and he needed to save a break point in the second set			0
ultimately he was able to make it into the last eight without dropping a set and he will be totally fresh for the next match			0
done and dusted : @entity0 wrapped up a 7 - 5 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 victory in the last - 16 contest just as against @entity99 in the third round @entity0 played a high quality first set and bar an angry blip early in the second , when he began ranting like a late night reveller on @entity106 's @entity105 , the standard was impressive for the most part			1
early on his serve looked nigh on impregnable and break points were forced in the @entity13 's two opening service games			0
the first was saved by a 130mph winner but the next two saw the @entity76 getting into the rally before fluffing a forehand and then a backhand into the net			0
this is the kind of thing that happens when you are short of confidence building wins against the best players			0
the reason @entity0 likes this particular match - up most of the time is that he can absorb the power coming from the other end and react to it , which is his natural modus operandi			2
watchful eye : @entity0 's coach @entity129 and hitting partner @entity130 in the stands spectator : @entity0 's girlfriend @entity29 watches the action on @entity28 on her feet : @entity137 cheers on her man in his last - 16 contest in @entity140 but @entity3 cut down his unforced errors , at least until they got to 6 - 5 when he was gifted two break points			1
on the second he made no mistake , driving the return deep into the corner and then running in after it to put away the volley			0
in the third game , @entity3 got hold of @entity0 's inviting second serve and nicked a break from 15 - 40 down when an attempted drop shot faded into the net			1
@entity0 berated himself in the manner that he pretty much cut out under @entity156			0
' you 're so slow ! ' she shouted at himself , followed by ' you 've got two legs , use them ! ' all of this gives succour to an opponent and soon the @entity76 was also unloading at his box to a bemused looking @entity129 about his inability to pin down @entity3 , who was forcing him further back in the court			0
awaiting : @entity8 is next up in the quarter - finals of the @entity6 at @entity54 eyes on the prize : the @entity55 star cruised past @entity86 6 - 1 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 on monday embrace : @entity8 and @entity86 shake hands after their last - 16 match on @entity175 chuntering to himself and abusing his coaching staff rarely works but it fired him up when he blasted two exquisite winners to level at 4 - 4 with @entity3 's level now suddenly dropping , as it is wont to do			1
running in to crunch away some dreadful drop shots @entity0 suddenly forced a set point at 6 - 5 and made no mistake with a deep backhand that drew a forehand error to go two sets up			1
in this punishing arena , complete with humidity , @entity0 's weeks of training in @entity189 each year are particularly handy but if @entity3 was downcast by losing five of the previous six games he hid it well by going an early break up			1
that was wiped out immediately and the pressure saw the @entity13 's serve collapse at 4 - 5 with two double faults that let @entity0 close it out .			2

@entity59 no 1 moves into quarter - finals of @entity6 in @entity140
@entity0 too strong for @entity3 as he records *comfortable* victory
@entity3 held breaks of serve in second and third sets but lost both
@entity8 next up for 2012 champion in quarter - finals
