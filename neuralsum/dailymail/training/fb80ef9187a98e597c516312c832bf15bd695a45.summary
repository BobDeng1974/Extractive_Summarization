he will visit @entity33 and @entity34 and tomorrow working breakfast : the prime minister @entity2 meets with local business leaders at the @entity6 embassy deals are also due on more than £ 200 million of new @entity10 investment in @entity6 , said to be creating 1,500 jobs and safeguarding thousands more			1
mr @entity2 will visit @entity55 ’s headquarters in @entity56 tomorrow , where the car giant is to announce that its @entity59 plant will produce a new hatchback from 2014			1
' it ’s fantastic news that @entity55 will be building their new hatchback model in the @entity6 and that they expect to create more than 1,000 jobs at the @entity59 plant and in the supply chain across the country , ' he said			1
' it is proof of the strength and vitality of the @entity6 manufacturing industry that leading companies like @entity55 are expanding their production in the @entity6			1
' trade drive : mr @entity2 speaks to employees at @entity55 headquarters in @entity3 manufacturing : the prime minister shakes hands with @entity55 's chief operating officer			1
mr @entity2 hopes to attract fresh @entity10 investment in the @entity6 car industry other announcements will include @entity84 setting up a fuel cell research and development centre in @entity86 , and a @entity88 project in @entity89 to build a new type of generator for wind turbines			1
the prime minister will stress that the coalition ’s policies mean the @entity6 has the lowest corporation tax rate in the @entity97 , making it an attractive destination for foreign firms			1
@entity2 has warned @entity100 that it would be ' unacceptable ' to defy calls for rocket tests to be abandoned			1
speaking on a visit to nearby @entity10 , the prime minister urged the state to ' take a different path ' and engage with the international community			2
mr @entity2 and counterpart @entity27 discussed the threat from @entity100 when they held talks today			2
the nuclear - armed regime is putting the finishing touches to a rocket that it says is designed to put a satellite into orbit			2
however , the @entity117 believes the launch - due this week - is a cover for testing a ballistic missile and @entity10 has deployed its anti-missile systems			2
' on the issue of @entity100 we have said very clearly and the @entity10 and others have said that it is unacceptable to launch these satellites and missiles , ' mr @entity2 told tv station @entity127			2
' now there is a new leadership in @entity100 they should be taking this opportunity to change their approach , engaging with the rest of the word and stopping this sort of activity			0
' if they go ahead it should be condemned in the strongest possible terms by the @entity141			0
' we have to send the clearest possible message ... clearly @entity100 is quite a bankrupt country ; they are unable to feed their own people and interestingly @entity117 has been helping			0
' we need to explain that they need to take a different path			0
they need to do less in terms of weapons and the military and more engagement with the rest of the world			0
' if they launch this satellite , that is clearly a breach of the @entity141 resolution that has already been ratified			0
' he will also call for faster progress towards establishing a free trade area between the @entity163 and @entity10			0
@entity10 is still the world ’s third largest economy despite enduring a ' lost decade ' of stagnation - similar to that predicted by some for @entity6			1
they will also hold talks on the dangers posed by nearby @entity100 - which is expected to stoke controversy by test firing a rocket later this week			0
however , mr @entity2 ’s focus on wider political and economic matters is unlikely to mean he escapes pressure over the continuing domestic fallout from the @entity181 and civil liberties rows that have been dogging the coalition			2
speaking to @entity10 newspaper @entity183 ahead of his visit , he said the countries were ' old friends ' but wanted to deepen ties			0
' there ’s an important diplomatic , political sense to this			0
' but also i think that we ’re both in need of economic growth and economic development , and i think the chance of expanding our trade and investment ties is very strong ... ' there is obviously very important inward investment from @entity10 into @entity6			1
' we ’re very proud of the fact that companies like @entity55 , @entity203 , @entity204 - all of whom i ’ve visited in the @entity6 - very proud of that investment			1
i want to see a new generation of investment into those plants			0
' but also we think there ’s a big opportunity to open up greater exports from @entity6 into the @entity10 economy			2
' mr @entity2 went on : ' i greatly admire and respect the way the @entity10 have overcome the enormous challenges of recovery following last year ’s earthquake			2
' the @entity6 stood by @entity10 in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake when we kept our @entity221 open in @entity3 and through the reassuring advice of our chief scientific adviser , sir @entity40 , who will be joining me on this trip			2
' looking to the future , we want to continue to support the @entity10 as they reconstruct the @entity226 and tackle the challenges of the nuclear clean - up			1
' @entity6 companies have significant expertise in nuclear decommissioning and clean - up , with 19 nuclear sites in the @entity6 currently being managed through the process			1
' i really think that concrete experience can be of direct benefit to @entity10			0
' efforts : government officials insist that exports to countries where mr @entity2 takes a trade delegation are boosted by a fifth mr @entity2 talks with @entity55 's executive vice president @entity242 as chief operating officer @entity243 looks on			1
( right ) an employee takes a photograph of the prime minister during a tour of the factory speaking to journalists on the flight to @entity10 , mr @entity2 said : ' part of the job of the prime minister is to load up an aeroplane full of business people , large and small , get our exports up , get our investment up , get out there and fly the flag for @entity6			1
that is what i am trying to do this week			0
' he insisted there was no moral issue with taking arms manufacturers on such trips			0
' there are a number of defence manufacturers with us , ' he said			0
' i ’m completely upfront about that because we do have a very strong defence sector			0
it accounts for a lot of jobs , we have some of the toughest rules on defence exports anywhere in the world			0
' but as these countries , particularly @entity10 , that have tended in the past to buy only @entity117 equipment are opening up , there are opportunities for people like @entity287 , who make helicopters , who are on this plane			0
' i think that ’s perfectly responsible and respectable			0
' landmark : @entity2 will meet with @entity293 's democracy leader @entity292 on friday @entity2 is to become the first @entity295 leader to visit @entity292 since the @entity297 laureate was elected to parliament			1
