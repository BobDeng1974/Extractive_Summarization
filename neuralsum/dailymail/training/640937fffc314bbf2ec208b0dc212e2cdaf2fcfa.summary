by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 10:34 est , 17 june 2013 updated : 02:29 est , 18 june 2013 every family in @entity3 could be £ 380 better off from a landmark trade deal between the @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity7 hailed the ‘ biggest bilateral trade deal in history ’ at the launch of negotiations for an agreement which could be worth £ 100 billion to the @entity12 economy			1
in the first major announcement of the @entity16 in @entity17 , mr @entity7 and @entity5 president @entity18 removed their ties to strike a casual look at the @entity23 resort			1
speaking at a press conference , the prime minister said talks to break down trade barriers between the @entity12 and the @entity5 could create two million extra jobs and would help to ‘ fire up ’ global economies			1
he added : ‘ there is no more powerful way to achieve that than by boosting trade and there 's no better way than by launching these negotiations on a landmark deal between the @entity12 and the @entity5 , a deal that could add as much as g £ 100 billion to the @entity12 economy , £ 80 billion to the @entity5 economy and as much as £ 85 billion to the rest of the world			1
we are talking about what could be the biggest bilateral trade deal in history			2
a deal that will have a greater impact than all the other trade deals on the table put together			0
’ contrast : president @entity18 chose to don a jacket at the press conference ( left ) but there was no sign of the tie he wore on a visit to a school in @entity74 change : the prime minister looked smart at he visited the school but opted to go tieless and jacketless for the press conference at the @entity16 the announcement does not mean a deal has been struck , but signals what could be months of thrashing out the details of an agreement to make it easier for businesses in the @entity12 and the @entity5 to trade with each other			1
@entity5 will host the first round of negotiations next month , president @entity18 said as he hailed the ‘ potentially groundbreaking partnership ’			2
he warned against ‘ downgrading ambition ’ in a rush to strike an agreement , insisting both sides had to be bold			0
he added : ‘ i am hopeful we can achieve the kind of high standards comprehensive agreement that the global trading system is looking to us to develop			0
‘ @entity5 and @entity6 have done extraordinary things together before and i believe we can forge an economic alliance as strong as our diplomatic and security alliances			2
’ talks : it could take many months for the deal to be struck , with president @entity18 warning against rushing to reach an unambitious agreement president @entity18 said it was important that the @entity5 and @entity12 ‘ get it right ’			1
‘ that means resisting the temptation to downgrade our ambition or avoid tough issues just for the sake of getting a deal			0
’ the president said the leaders would be giving a ‘ mandate ’ to their negotiators , but added that it was likely they would have to step in personally to resolve particularly difficult issues			0
their appearance at the press conference kickstarting the @entity16 was in stark contrast to an earlier visit by mr @entity7 and mr @entity18 to a local school where , still wearing ties , they joined in with an art session			1
the two leaders visited @entity129 as they prepared for the formal start of the two - day summit being held in the @entity17 town from this afternoon			0
en route in the president ’s armoured car , known as @entity137 , the pair discussed the fraught issues facing global leaders gathered in the @entity3 for the annual talks , most notably the serious split in the international community over the @entity144 crisis			2
they were resuming the discussions in the vehicle on the return journey to the luxury golf resort on the shores of @entity23 which is hosting the summit			0
it was all smiles as they chatted with pupils in a classroom of the modern school building - which educates equal numbers of @entity159 and @entity161 pupils			0
allies : @entity7 and @entity18 helped students paint a mural during a visit to the @entity129 in @entity74 ahead of crunch talks on @entity144 at the @entity16 art : the @entity5 president and @entity3 prime minister signed a project at the school to mark the summit being held in their town in this pictured posted online by mr @entity7 message : mr @entity7 wrote ' with thanks for all you do ' while mr @entity18 added ' dream top dreams ' it is the only integrated primary school in @entity181 - and was set up by a cross-community group in the wake of the 1987 @entity185 bombing in the town which killed 11 and injured 63			1
at present , only 6 % of primary and secondary schools are integrated and the importance of mixed - faith education was one of the central messages of mr @entity18 ’s speech about the peace process in @entity195 this morning			2
the politicians , who were shown around by 11 - year - olds @entity197 and @entity199 , also signed a @entity16 tapestry			2
but the pair ’s friendly rivalry - previously seen at table tennis , among other arenas - was soon on show when they joined a group in the playground finishing the large artwork			0
“ do you think you can handle this @entity7 ? , ” the @entity5 president joked as he pointed the prime minister towards a section to paint			1
mr @entity18 was soon admitting he was in trouble for “ going outside the lines ” - securing an assurance from pupils that he would not be punished			0
give up : after failing to keep inside the lines , president @entity18 boasted he could have been an artist art : mr @entity18 painted the ' e ' while mr @entity7 filled in the second ' n ' during their visit to @entity129 but it was mr @entity7 who received praise from the teacher - and three cheers from the pupils - for finishing his section first and not straying beyond the boundaries in his work			1
“ i did n’t realise @entity7 was going to move so fast , ” mr @entity18 joked			2
but he refused to admit defeat , insisting : “ i ’m not as good as these guys but i ’m better than @entity7			0
” the leaders - both wearing blue ties but with mr @entity7 in a blue shirt to the president ’s white - first signed their names on a @entity16 - themed patchwork quilt			1
mr @entity18 wrote ‘ @entity244 ’ while the prime minister added ‘ with thanks for all you do ’ under his signature			1
moving on to the classroom , they were treated to a show of the youngsters ’ knowledge of the summit			0
the leaders went to the playground to engage in their artistic contest - the president choosing to colour in with blue paint the initial ‘ e ’ of @entity74 on the giant artwork spread across several tables while the prime minister took on the second ‘ n ’			1
within seconds , mr @entity18 admitted : ‘ i think i ’ve gone outside the lines			0
’ he was later told that not only had he failed to match mr @entity7 ’s neatness but had not managed to complete his colouring task either .			0

@entity7 and @entity18 launch formal talks on trade deal
but they adopt casual dress code at first @entity16 press conference
talks will make it easier for @entity5 and @entity6 firms to do business
prime minister claims it could benefit @entity3 by £ 10billion - or £ 380 per family
