by @entity0 last updated at 4:38 pm on 20th december 2011 tens of thousands of women with breast implants are being urged to have medical check - ups amid fears they are at heightened risk of cancer			2
the safety alert follows the death of a @entity11 woman who had implants filled with silicone gel believed to have been made for mattresses			1
up to 50,000 @entity16 women – including some breast cancer survivors – have the @entity11 - made implants , which are fragile and more likely to leak than other brands			1
@entity20 was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer two years after having breast surgery using a @entity11 - made silicone gel			1
( see box below ) fears about the safety of @entity27 – or @entity28 – which were among the cheapest implants on the market , first surfaced 18 months ago			2
however , they receded after tests failed to find any firm evidence that the implants could trigger cancer			2
now , the death of 53 - year - old @entity20 , in a @entity38 cancer clinic , from a rare form of cancer , has reignited concern			2
although the link with the implants has n’t been established , it is feared that the gel leaked out of her breasts and into her system			1
the @entity48 of @entity49 and @entity50 says the gel could have been an ‘ aggravating factor ’ in the cancer			2
it is reviewing its policy on the implants			0
their @entity16 counterparts have urged women not to worry – but say that patients who have , or suspect they have these implants , should have regular scans to check for flaws and cracks			0
if there are signs of damage , implants on both sides should be removed			0
some gps may be happy to refer women for an ultrasound , otherwise they will have to pay for it privately			0
the @entity73 does take out damaged implants but wo n’t pay for new ones to be put in , meaning patients could be left with a bill that runs into thousands of pounds – as well as the trauma of additional surgery			0
the alarm was first raised in @entity11 after surgeons noticed that @entity27 implants were rupturing much more quickly than other more expensive brands			1
an inquiry ordered by the @entity11 health watchdog reported ‘ serious ’ irregularities in the implants last summer			1
among other things , when the gel ’s manufacturer was asked for studies on its safety , it said it did not have any – because it believed it was to be used in the manufacture of mattresses			1
in 2009 , the @entity11 government agency responsible for medical equipment safety standards , @entity97 , received a number of complaints about the @entity27 implants			1
an inquiry ordered by the @entity11 health watchdog reported ' serious ' irregularities in the implants last summer ( posed by models ) @entity97 found that 10 per cent of the company ’s implants ruptured within a year			1
on average , implants should last at least 10 years			0
in @entity16 , the @entity107 , which is responsible for the safety of drugs and medical devices , told surgeons to stop using the implants			0
subsequent tests appeared to rule out any risk of cancer or poisoning and the @entity107 said patients should be reassured that there is ‘ no current evidence ’ of a health risk			0
last night , the @entity107 said that breast implants have also been linked to cancer in @entity122			0
a spokesman added that any woman concerned that her implants has ruptured should speak to the surgeon who put them in for her			1
@entity16 plastic surgeons said the fault lies at the door of the manufacturer , who has now gone into liquidation			0
@entity135 , president of the @entity136 , said : ‘ it is important to remember that the number of breast implant patients globally is considered to be higher than ten million , yet these tumours are extremely rare			0
‘ in relation to @entity28 , we continue to reiterate our advice to @entity16 patients in line with the @entity11 authorities : if you have , or suspect you have these implants , you should have a scan every six months			1
‘ if there is any rupture or weakening , have both implants removed			0
