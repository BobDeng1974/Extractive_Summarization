by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:20 est , 14 august 2013 updated : 13:58 est , 14 august 2013 doctors say the 12 - year - old girl who contracted a deadly amoeba while swimming at an @entity6 water park will be the third to survive the brain - eating parasite			1
@entity9 contracted parasitic meningitis , a very rare form of meningitis that only 130 people have been diagnosed with in the @entity14 in the past fifty years , a month ago			1
it 's 99 per cent fatal with only two reported instances of survival			0
but doctors now believe @entity9 will make it out of the woods , due in large part to early detection and experimental treatment			1
doctors diagnosed her with primary amebic meningoencephalitis ( @entity41 ) , a rare form of meningitis which has only produced 130 cases in the @entity14 in the past 50 years			1
the rare form of meningitis is caused by the naegleria fowleri amoeba entering the body through the nose and traveling into the brain			2
symptoms appear quickly , about one to seven days after inception , and include headache , fever , nausea , vomiting and get worse causing stiff neck , confusion , loss of balance , seizures and hallucinations			0
eventually the infection destroys brain tissue which causes fatal brain swelling			0
to combat the the infection , doctors cooled @entity9 's body to reduce the swelling and even put her on breast - cancer drugs			1
' she wound up being on a ventilator for over two weeks , ' said dr. @entity70 , one of the doctors who treated her			2
but the treatment seems to have worked , and she was taken off the ventilator on august 6			0
three days later , @entity9 was moved out of the pediatric intensive care unit			1
making strides : doctors believe early detection and experimental treatments are helping @entity9 get over her infection stronger : @entity9 was taken off a ventilator and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit last week on monday her family posted a picture on a @entity85 support page of @entity86 writing her name for the first time			1
that 's remarkable progress for a girl who was barely able to squeeze her mother 's hand last week			0
they are obviously ecstatic at the change of outlook			0
' we 've went from being told that our little girl would n't survive this amoeba to now they 're saying that @entity9 is going to be the third survivor and going to get to go home , ' said her mother @entity103			1
mother 's battle : @entity103 , @entity9 's mother , is battling breast cancer and is focusing on being healthy to take care of her daughter when she is released from the hospital primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific			1
it is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim 's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses			1
the amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive			0
it grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm , stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees			0
the water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans			0
health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the @entity14 in the last 50 years			0
only one person has survived in the @entity14			0
one other survivor was found in @entity137 health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by : ms @entity9 , who is battling breast cancer , is now making sure to focus on her health so she can take care of @entity9 when she gets home			1
' it 's kind of a battle to decide that you want to put your health on hold because you want to totally focus on @entity86 , but i know i have to try to get myself better too , because @entity9 's coming home and i 'm going to get to take care of her , ' she said			1
ms @entity9 is also hoping to raise awareness of another case of @entity41			2
@entity156 is being treated for the infection at @entity158			0
he contracted the amoeba while knee boarding in a ditch near his house with friends in @entity164 , @entity165 earlier this month			2
' we 're praying for him to be survivor number four , ' ms @entity9 said			2
the condition is caused when the @entity171 parasite enters a patient 's brain , usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant , warm water up the nose while swimming			1
@entity6 @entity177 spokesman @entity176 told @entity178 the water must be forcefully , almost violently , pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water , being dunked or using a water slide			1
@entity171 are found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes			1
but , they only become active when water heats up			0
the cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from the heat			0
the @entity195 says there have been around 130 cases of the disease in the @entity14 in the last five decades - making the disease extremely rare , when compared to the number of lakes and muddy swimming holes @entity14 dip into for refuge from the summer heat each year			2
another case : 12 - year - old @entity156 of @entity164 , @entity165 is also fighting the infection after contracting the amoeba knee boarding in a ditch earlier this month the @entity14 has recorded just 130 cases of naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years the amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees , @entity176 said			1
however , this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at @entity37			2
in august 2010 , 7 - year - old @entity216 died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake			2
because two cases have been seen from the same body was water , state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole			2
' though the odds of contracting @entity171 are extremely low , they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim , ' owners @entity225 and @entity226 said in a statement			2
closed : the owners of @entity37 near @entity38 , @entity6 , have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years another tragedy : @entity216 , 7 , died of the disease in 2010 after swimming at the @entity37 - where little @entity9 is believed to have been infected the park , which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by @entity38			1
@entity9 's mother said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease			1
' you 're a mom , you 're a dad			0
you can still take your child swimming			0
we do n't want to scare people			0
we just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out			0
so they can go and still be a kid , ' she said			0
she encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the @entity171 parasite			1
still , @entity176 , of the health department , says that swimmers really should n't be too concerned about the danger of swimming in fresh water .			0

@entity9 , 12 , contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after swimming at @entity37 near @entity38 , @entity6
disease is caused by inhaling water infected with the @entity171 amoeba
only two people in the world are known to have survived the disease - and doctors think she will be the third
@entity9 was taken off a ventilator and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit last week
