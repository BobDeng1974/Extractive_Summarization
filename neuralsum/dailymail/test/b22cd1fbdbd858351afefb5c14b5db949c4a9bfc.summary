if the @entity2 players had been shocked by wednesday 's news that manager @entity4 will quit the club at the end of the season , they showed no sign that it had affected them on saturday			1
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 were on target as @entity2 returned to winning ways with a comfortable victory against relegation - threatened @entity15 at @entity16			1
the win moved last season 's @entity19 runners - up to eighth in the table and leaves them with a realistic chance of qualifying for @entity25 , which would be a remarkable achievement for a club that was flirting with relegation themselves earlier in the year			0
@entity10 makes it 2 - 0 to @entity2 as the home side cruised to victory against @entity15 @entity32 celebrates with his trademark front flip after doubling the home side 's lead @entity38 international @entity32 wheels away in celebration after giving @entity2 a two - goal cushion @entity2 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity41 ; @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 82 ) ; @entity47 , @entity48 ; @entity49 ( @entity50 75 ) , @entity11 , @entity9 ; @entity51 ( @entity52 85 ) subs not used : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , scorer ( s ) : @entity9 48 , @entity10 55 , @entity11 80 booked : @entity59 manager : @entity4 @entity15 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity61 ; @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 ( @entity65 82 ) , @entity66 ; @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ( @entity71 57 ) ; @entity72 ( @entity73 72 ) , @entity74 subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 manager : @entity81 referee : @entity83 much of the pre-amble to this fixture understandably centred on @entity4 's surprise announcement - coming at a press conference on wednesday - but @entity2 are slowly creeping back up the table and with victory here moved to within three points of sixth - place @entity92			1
@entity2 had lost their two previous @entity19 matches against @entity94 and @entity95 and , after being held by the visitors for the opening 45 minutes , cruised to victory with plenty to spare			0
after a frustrating opening 45 the hosts had to wait just three minutes after the interval before taking the lead			0
@entity10 delivered a perfect cross from theright and @entity105 international @entity9 powered a near post header past @entity61			0
@entity2 , clearly wary of their poor defensive record this season , continued to press and increased their advantage just eight minutes later when @entity10 got his name on the scoresheet after providing the first			0
the win came three days after manager @entity4 announced he will quit the club in the summer a @entity2 fan holds up a sign thanking @entity4 for his achievements in the last seven years the home crowd paid tribute to their soon - to - be departing manager who twice led them to @entity19 glory the @entity38 striker calmly finished over the on - rushing @entity61 after the ball broke for him in the penalty following @entity15 's failure to deal with a cross			1
the visitors stunned @entity4 's side by coming from two down in the reverse fixture earlier this season to earn a point , but there was to be no repeat this time around			2
former @entity136 midfielder @entity11 made absolutely sure of that when he latched on to @entity9 's ball with 10 minutes to play before escaping a challenge and firing past @entity61 to complete a routine win			2
@entity9 heads the home side in front just three minutes after half - time at @entity16 @entity15 goalkeeper @entity61 fails to keep @entity9 's header out at his near post the @entity105 international is mobbed by his team - mates after giving @entity2 a second - half lead			2
