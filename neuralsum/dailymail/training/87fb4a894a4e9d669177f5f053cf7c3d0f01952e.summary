last year , 200 offenders – including rapists and muggers – successfully challenged their removal by citing @entity22 8 of @entity24 ’s @entity23			1
ministers are promising to tighten the rules using the government ’s @entity27 , which will be debated by @entity4 next week			2
but , in the latest challenge to the prime minister ’s authority , 100 mps say the government ’s proposals do not go far enough			2
they are backing a rebel amendment , tabled by @entity37 @entity36 , that would make it all but impossible for foreign criminals to exercise their @entity22 8 right to a ‘ family life ’			1
ministers have been resisting the amendment , which they claim is so strict that it could flout the @entity23 and the @entity43			1
it could lead to a humiliating split in the @entity46			2
backbenchers already want to use the @entity27 to reinstate controls on workers from @entity50 and @entity51 , leaving @entity53 fighting fires on two fronts			2
there are currently about 4,000 overseas convicts living in the @entity11 that the government wants to remove but is blocked from doing so by human rights laws			0
two years ago , home secretary @entity59 issued new instructions to the courts to say that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances			1
but immigration judges defied her on the grounds that the guidance was not primary legislation so did not carry the same weight as the @entity23			1
mrs may is now seeking to change the law to state that @entity22 should no longer normally be a bar to deportation			1
but @entity37 @entity4 say her proposals still leave too much discretion in the hands of the courts , which could block deportation if the criminal can prove a ‘ genuine and subsisting ’ relationship with a partner or child			0
the backbench amendment removes the discretionary element , so courts would have to order deportation of a foreign criminal jailed for a year or more , unless he faced torture or death on removal			1
the only exception would be if the home secretary thinks halting a deportation ‘ is in the overwhelming humanitarian interests of the offender ’s children ’			0
mr @entity36 said the courts need to be told to deport in unequivocal language			0
‘ this amendment will cut the spurious human rights challenges lodged by convicted killers , rapists and drug dealers to evade deportation , and restore some common sense to our border controls , ’ he said			2
‘ having talked about reform for the last three years , it ’s time we delivered – that ’s what this amendment will do			0
’ two years ago , home secretary @entity59 issued new instructions to the courts to say that overseas convicts should normally be deported regardless of their family circumstances the amendment is a massive new headache for @entity53			2
up to 70 @entity37 backbenchers are already planning to use the legislation to call for the re-instatement of controls on migrants from @entity51 and @entity50 , which the government says would flout @entity124 law			0
the @entity27 has already been withdrawn once to avoid a confrontation with rebels			0
but mr @entity2 has been warned that unless the @entity128 returns next week , it would run out of time to get through the @entity130 in this parliamentary session and could be lost altogether			1
a @entity133 spokesman said : ‘ those who abuse our hospitality by committing serious crimes have no place in @entity11 and we are determined to see more of them kicked out			0
‘ we are passing legislation to ensure judges do n’t regard the right to a family life as an absolute and unqualified one			1
’ @entity145 , 31 , was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ' vulnerable ' victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home a @entity149 rapist , who held a knife to a pregnant woman ’s throat as he assaulted her , is among the many criminals who can not be deported from @entity11 because of rules on a right to family life			1
@entity145 , 31 , was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ‘ vulnerable ’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home			0
he was set to be deported on release and @entity133 lawyers warned immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law			0
but in december last year he was deemed to have a right to a family life under @entity22 and released			1
@entity145 does not have any children or a wife in @entity11 , but his mother and siblings live here			0
the judges gave him credit for having put his criminal behaviour ‘ behind him ’			0
they also concluded he posed a ‘ low risk ’ of offending again , based on evidence from a psychiatrist who saw him for only a couple of hours .			0
