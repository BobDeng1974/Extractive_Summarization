by @entity0 published : 19:02 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 19:02 est , 28 january 2014 a new generation of ultra-thin , bendable mobile phones are being developed - inspired by the humble cuttlefish			0
known as the chameleons of the marine world , cuttlefish can change the colour and texture of their skin , even disguising themselves as floating seaweed as they stalk their prey			1
it is this remarkable natural ability scientists hope to harness to develop paper - like flexible displays that can be rolled up like a cigarette			1
known as the chameleons of the marine world , cuttlefish can change the colour and texture of their skin , even disguising themselves as floating seaweed as they stalk their prey they have found the cuttlefish relies on optical properties that change thanks to nerve - controlled pigments in cells called chromatophores			1
bright red proteins in these chromatophores may open the door to foldable , and even wearable screens , reports the @entity32			0
dr @entity33 , of @entity34 , said : ‘ our data suggest visible colouration in the @entity39 officinalis chromatophore is facilitated by the nanostructure and composition of the pigment granules themselves			1
mobile manufacturers are already working on flexible displays such as this prototype @entity47 smartphone unveiled last year			1
@entity50 researchers hope their work could lead to more advanced screens that are so flexible they can be rolled up like cigarettes the skin of cuttlefish have cells containing striped structures			2
these structures have a layer of pigmented sacs called chromatophores as well as a layer of reflecting plates called iridophores			1
by contracting and relaxing muscles attached to chromatophores they can control the amount of pigment revealed			0
finding ways to mimic this optical trickery has received a lot of attention in recent years			0
as well as the team at @entity34 , a group at the @entity75 recently created artificial muscles and chromatophores using elastic plastic material that responds to an electrical stimulus			2
‘ this hierarchy enables the cuttlefish to produce a wide variety of body patterns that function in signalling displays or camouflage			2
’ he added that materials capable of changing colour in displays are coveted for consumer electronics , as well as camouflaging paints , textiles and cosmetics			1
cuttlefish and other such ‘ cephalopods ’ - a class of molluscs which also include octopuses and squids - can provide a biological model			2
‘ cuttlefish possess neutrally - controlled , pigmented chromatophore organs that allow rapid changes in skin patterning and colouration in response to visual cues , ’ said dr @entity33			0
‘ examination of cephalopods , similar to the cuttlefish @entity112 , can elucidate the basic biological , chemical and optical functionalities necessary to provide design rules for novel high performance colourants required in adaptive , flexible displays			1
’ prototypes of flexible smartphones have already been attracting crowds at gadget shows			0
researchers are also working on bendable and transparent displays and surfaces that could in future be part of flexible tablets , tvs and solar cells			0

cuttlefish are able to change colour using pigments called chromatophores
nanostructure of chromatophores could be used as a model to develop flexible displays that roll up like a cigarette , according to @entity34
it could also be used to develop camouflaging paints , textiles and cosmetics
