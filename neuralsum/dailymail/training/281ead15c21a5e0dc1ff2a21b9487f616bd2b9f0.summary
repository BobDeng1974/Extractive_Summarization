by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 05:19 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 12:58 est , 15 january 2013 @entity2 has said @entity3 will stay in the shadow of @entity6 's elite unless influx of foreign players is brought under control @entity3 will stay in the shadow of @entity6 's elite unless the influx of foreign players to the @entity14 is brought under control , the @entity11 president has said			1
@entity2 is adamant the national team will fail to develop if managers keep looking abroad for players			1
he believes @entity3 are significantly in the shadow of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 - and so will therefore never win a @entity23 unless the buying of players from overseas is limited			1
he is however impressed with how the @entity14 has been marketed and sold around the world			0
mr @entity2 was speaking during a wide - ranging interview with @entity28 on @entity29 , in which he tackled subjects including racism , future world cups and the possibility of being succeeded by @entity34			2
he said : ‘ i do n’t think the @entity14 is too global ( but ) you have too many foreigners and not ( enough ) @entity38 players , so your national team is not yet at the level of these national teams			1
‘ if you look to @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , you realise 80 per cent or even more of the players of the national team play in their own league			1
’ mr @entity2 , who confirmed that goalline technology will be trialled during this summer ’s @entity46 , called for clubs whose fans racially abuse players to be docked points			2
‘ a more radical solution would be deduction of points , ’ said mr @entity2			2
‘ deduction would have a better impact			0
to have a match played without spectators is a warning			0
you can never solve a problem by running away			0
' the @entity3 team pictured during the @entity62 in 2012 @entity3 's striker @entity64 , @entity3 's midfielder @entity65 and @entity3 's defender @entity66 as they lost 4 - 1 against @entity22 in the 2010 @entity23 @entity3 was once one of the most fancied teams when entering into the @entity23 but betting odds this time round suggest otherwise			1
@entity72 odds for @entity3 winning the cup in 2014 are 25:1 - relatively poor compared to previous years			2
the national team appears to have been on the decline for a while now , with most of the so - called ' @entity76 ' having retired from international football			1
@entity3 will take a new generation of players to the @entity80 @entity23 in 2014 and it is thought the team would do well to reach the @entity82			1
in 1990 @entity3 did well , making it to the @entity82 but being eliminated on penalties against @entity22			1
but in 1994 the team did not even qualify			0
in 1998 the team were eliminated on penalties against @entity88 in the first @entity89			0
they did better in 2001 , where they made it to the @entity82 but lost 2 - 1 again @entity80			0
again in 2006 they made it to the @entity82 but were eliminated on penalties against @entity97			0
2010 saw an embarrassing 4 - 1 defeat against @entity22 in the @entity99			2
the team have so far had a shaky start in @entity102 , showing the road to @entity104 is set to be an uphill struggle			0
@entity3 drew with the @entity106 in september and drew again with @entity107 in october			0
they still have to play @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 and only group winners progress to the finals			0
the eight best runners - up from the nine @entity6 groups - according to all their matches except for games against the sixth - placed team in their group - play off for the four remaining spots .			1
