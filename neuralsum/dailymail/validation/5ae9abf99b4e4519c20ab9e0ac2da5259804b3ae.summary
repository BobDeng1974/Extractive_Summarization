justice secretary @entity62 said yesterday : ‘ we ca n’t go on with a situation where our boys are hamstrung by human rights laws … i made it clear last year that i want to rip up @entity88 ’s @entity12 and that it is only the conservatives who will make real changes to the human rights framework to restore some common sense			2
