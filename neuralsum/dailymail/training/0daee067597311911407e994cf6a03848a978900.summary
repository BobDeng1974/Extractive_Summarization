one in 10 employees wants to work more hours every week , a new study revealed today			0
but a similar number would like to put in fewer hours for less pay			0
around three million people are classed as under - employed , wanting to work an extra 11 hours a week on average , said the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
this year , underemployed workers would like to work an extra 33.5million hours , compared to 21.2million in 2008			1
there are almost 3million people who would like to more work , up from just over 2million six hours ago			0
at the same time 9.7 per cent of workers , a total of 2.9 million people , would like to work fewer hours			0
the average number of hours less that each overemployed worker wanted to work was 11.2 hours per week , which equates to 32.6 million hours per week for all those overemployed in the @entity17			2
the @entity18 has the highest percentage of under - employed workers in @entity17			1
one in five part - timers is under - employed compared with one in 20 in a full - time job			1
dr @entity23 , director of @entity24 , said : ' as expected , the number of under - employed workers fell by 116,000 in the year to @entity27 2014 but the figure remains staggeringly high , marking the sixth successive year in which the under - employment rate has been above 9.5 per cent			1
' such a prolonged period of mass under - employment demonstrates the extent to which the very good headline employment and unemployment figures of recent years mask a substantial underlying shortage of work , the persistence of which takes some gloss off the @entity17 's supposed ' jobs miracle '			1
' with almost three million people under - employed alongside still almost two million unemployed the pain of work shortage and associated pay weakness is likely to continue well into 2015			2
' @entity48 general secretary @entity47 said : ' under - employment is still much higher than it was before the recession , which is a clear sign that the @entity17 is n't creating enough of the right kind of jobs			2
' there is a big shortfall in the supply of full - time employee jobs , and that 's making it harder for families to earn enough for a decent standard of living			0
' it makes no sense that there are so many people wanting more work , while others complain of being overworked and want fewer hours			0
the government should strengthen flexible working rights , which could help solve both problems .			0

@entity6 finds 3million in the @entity17 are ' under - employed '
but the same number consider themselves *over-worked* in their jobs
@entity18 has the highest percentage of underemployed workers in @entity17
