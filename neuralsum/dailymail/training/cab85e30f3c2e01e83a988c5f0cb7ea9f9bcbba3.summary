everywhere @entity0 turned he was confronted by evidence of how success can happen when it is least expected			1
from the image of @entity4 lofting a ball over a tumbling @entity13 , the @entity15 pennant hanging in a cabinet to , above all , the @entity9 trophy glistening proudly in a cabinet outside @entity12 ’s trophy room , the spirit of @entity7 abounded			1
when you factor in that @entity0 was holding court on the 10th anniversary of the goal @entity23 scored against the @entity25 club that launched them on the way to their fifth @entity9 , @entity18 ’s manager could have not been in a better place if he was looking for omens			1
for all that @entity0 is prepared to embrace fantasy , though , he also deals in realism and if @entity18 are to preserve their place in this competition , history will have nothing to do with it			1
what he needs is a display full of vibrancy to show why they deserve a place among the elite			0
so far , this @entity9 campaign has been hugely anti-climatic ; a scruffy win on match - day one against @entity66 was followed by three consecutive defeats before a grinding 2 - 2 draw in @entity70 provided a shot at redemption			1
@entity0 knows @entity18 have to deliver			1
‘ once you get through the group stage anything can happen , ’ said the manager			1
‘ i know come february , when the @entity9 starts again , we will be a better team because of the players we will have available if we manage to get through			2
that is what i am looking forward to			0
@entity18 boss @entity0 has told his players to keep their composure against @entity32 on tuesday @entity23 ( right ) took part in the @entity85 ' training session at @entity12 on monday night the @entity18 skipper ( left ) plays a pass to team - mate @entity88 ( right ) during a training exercise @entity90 after five matches ‘ we have seen that the best team does n’t always win the competition			1
you can get a good draw , a bit of luck			0
but first things first , we need to get through			0
this would give the players a huge amount of confidence , having not consistently played that well all season			0
the key is to get a big win			1
‘ it may not come with a big performance but the main objective is the win			2
get that and we have seen over the years that qualification gives you confidence			2
we ’ve had big performances in my time and want to deliver another to give us that platform			2
’ @entity0 was speaking at @entity18 's pre-match press conference on monday ahead of their @entity32 clash the @entity85 need to beat @entity32 at @entity12 to qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity9 6 - @entity18 have gone six @entity9 games without a clean sheet - their longest run since conceding in eight straight games in the 2008 - 09 season			1
the topic of failure has not been broached in the dressing room			0
fail to beat @entity32 - who only need a point - and the second half of the campaign will look even more onerous , with a schedule of playing on thursdays and sundays			2
‘ if you end up in the @entity135 , you are still in @entity48 football even if it is not the competition you want to be in , ’ @entity0 argued			1
‘ that is what comes with it but for me the focus is on winning this game			0
the consequences of that will come after it			0
‘ i have n’t given the @entity135 a second ’s thought , to be honest			0
we qualified for this great competition , deservedly with our level of performance , and now we ’re here we want to do well in it			2
we saw ourselves as a team that can get out of the group and nothing has changed			2
’ @entity18 players are put through their paces during the club 's training session at @entity12 on monday @entity85 stopper @entity161 will be hoping to keep a clean sheet against their @entity164 opponents on tuesday kick - off : tuesday 7.45pm , @entity12 tv : live on @entity167 from 7.30pm referee : @entity169 ( @entity170 ) @entity171 : @entity18 to win 1 - 0 - 7/1 @entity172 @entity18 need to do : only a win at @entity12 on tuesday night will do in order for the @entity85 to progress			1
that message was shared by goalkeeper @entity161			0
while it was not as forthright as the speech @entity23 gave 10 years ago - ‘ i do n’t want to be waking up in the @entity135 ’ - @entity161 is not contemplating @entity18 capsizing at this particular hurdle			1
‘ we have to do the job in hand and look at ourselves , ’ said @entity161			0
‘ we have to be ready			0
nobody is thinking about not getting through			0
the only thing that matters is getting the result we need			0
’ do not think , however , this will be a night when @entity18 have things all their own way			1
@entity0 spoke at length about what the emotion and atmosphere inside the stadium will do for his players but that is not to say it will overpower their rivals			2
@entity0 will be hoping the talent of @entity197 ( left ) will play a major part in tuesday 's crunch tie @entity32 boss @entity200 says they plan to put @entity18 under pressure in their crunch @entity9 tie @entity32 exposed @entity18 ’s soft underbelly in october when they met and @entity200 , their urbane @entity206 coach , believes the pressure that will be on @entity0 and his players can be exploited			1
the message he will convey is that @entity18 are vulnerable			2
‘ we will put them more under pressure and hopefully we can have another magical night where the performance will be outstanding and the result will be in our favour , ’ said @entity200 , who ruled out any idea that @entity32 are coming to defend			1
‘ i am always looking for a win			0
it is something we keep working on			0
in my leadership and feedback to the players it is always playing to win			0
we have a game - plan , hopefully it is the correct one			0
’ @entity32 only need a draw to qualify for the knockout stages of the @entity9 on tuesday night @entity229 ( centre ) will be hoping to be involved in their crucial @entity9 tie at @entity18 @entity32 squad are put through their paces during monday 's training session at @entity12			1
