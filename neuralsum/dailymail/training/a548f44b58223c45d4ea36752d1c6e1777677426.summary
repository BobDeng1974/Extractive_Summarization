prince @entity1 has enlisted the help of one of @entity5 's top defence barristers after being accused of sleeping with an under - age ' sex slave ' , the @entity0 has learned			1
the @entity1 faces extraordinary claims – which he strongly denies – that he had sex with a 17 - year - old @entity11 girl who was being paid by his friend , the convicted paedophile @entity13			1
this week , he will attend the meeting of the @entity15 in @entity16 , his first public appearance since the allegations by @entity19 in a @entity11 lawsuit			1
but the fifth in line to the throne has quietly consulted the eminent @entity27 @entity26 , nicknamed the ' grandfather of the bar '			1
mr @entity26 is understood to be reading papers handed to him by the duke 's team on friday , january 8			1
it is not known what he has been asked to do or who is paying the bill , if any			2
but it raises the possibility that @entity1 is preparing for some sort of legal fightback			1
@entity11 @entity52 , one of @entity13 's lawyers who miss @entity19 claims also had sex with her , is counter-suing and has issued a detailed rebuttal			1
he has suggested the duke do the same			0
@entity1 will travel to @entity16 , in @entity57 , on thursday before making a defiant public address at the annual drinks reception he holds at the conference			1
the 54 - year - old has refused to cancel his plans and , unusually , will reportedly face a tv camera			1
normally his drinks event receives little media attention , but this year officials have been forced to plan how to manage large numbers of journalists			2
the palace last night refused to comment on the suggestion that @entity1 would issue an outright denial of the claims			1
his decision to attend has drawn criticism from some , including former home office minister @entity76			2
the @entity77 told @entity79 's today programme : ' it may have been more prudent			0
for him not to have gone			0
he may have taken that decision himself			0
when mps go abroad , or ministers , or indeed the @entity84 , we know exactly what role they are undertaking			0
we do n't know with @entity1			1
' prince @entity1 was spotted leaving his chalet with his daughter @entity87 after holidaying in @entity88 prince @entity1 , left , has been dragged into the controversy surrounding @entity13			1
the two are pictured together in @entity91 , in @entity92 the @entity1 is meeting his own travel and accommodation costs for the visit to @entity16 , although his police bodyguards are funded by the taxpayer			1
this is unlikely to appease critics of his jet - set lifestyle since the duke , dubbed ' @entity101 ' , still racks up more air travel than any other royal , four years after he stood down from his role as @entity5 trade ambassador over his links to @entity13 and other controversial figures			2
luxury : @entity109 in @entity110 the @entity15 's meeting in @entity16 is an incredibly exclusive – and expensive – event , with the average cost of attending reportedly about £ 26,400			1
guests are advised where to land their private jets and given contact details for the forum 's official helicopter carrier			0
heads of state mingle with bankers , chief executives and academics			0
@entity124 said prince @entity1 was meeting the costs himself			1
however , the duke has no income of his own			0
during the 2012 conference , he lodged in the nearby resort of @entity110 , a favourite ski destination of the royals for many years			0
he stayed in @entity133 , which rents for as much as £ 39,000 a week			2
he said some of the duke 's friends were ' not [ what ] someone representing @entity5 ought to be having '			0
sir @entity139 , the former @entity77 leader , said it was a time for ' discretion rather than distraction ' , while @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , @entity146 on the commons business committee , are said to have suggested that he stay away			0
@entity148 , which campaigns for an alternative to the monarchy , said last night : ' regardless of the truth of the allegations , his association with @entity13 and others has made his position untenable			2
' but lord @entity156 , former head of the @entity158 and @entity159 minister , said he should go , adding : ' this guy has done nothing until someone proves he has			0
to my knowledge no one has charged him with anything			0
' mr @entity26 , whose website says he is a specialist in ' white collar fraud ' , represented @entity169 , who was jailed for life for killing @entity169 in @entity172 in december 2010			1
he also acted for lord @entity173 , the @entity175 's son , who admitted beating his wife			0
@entity1 emphatically denies any sexual relations with miss @entity19 , who claims she was @entity13 's ' sex slave ' from 1999 to 2002 and was ' forced to have sexual relations with this prince ' in @entity181 , @entity92 and a @entity183 island			1
@entity124 has issued two denials on behalf of the duke , calling the claims ' categorically untrue '			2
he has yet to comment personally and has spent much of this month keeping a low profile at @entity188 , his home in @entity189			0
he is understood to be working on his speech , which will be largely aimed at promoting @entity5 business			0
' he may , briefly , address some of the issues we have seen aired in recent weeks , but claims that it will be a major televised rebuttal of what has been alleged are very overblown , ' a source said			2
the @entity0 understands @entity1 will stay on after the reception to attend scheduled sessions on friday as part of a ' business as usual strategy '			1
' he has work to do and wants to get on with it , ' the source said			0
' that 's not to say he has n't been chastened by what has happened			0
he has openly acknowledged his enormous error of judgment over his friendship with @entity13			0
' mr @entity26 declined to comment			2

@entity1 has enlisted help of @entity26 , a prominent defence barrister
@entity1 faces claims he had sex with a 17 - year - old @entity11 girl
@entity1 , who denies allegations , to make first public appearance this week
will attend meeting of the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity57
