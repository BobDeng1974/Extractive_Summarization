a young woman diagnosed with cervical cancer managed to save her fertility as well as beat the disease after ignoring doctors ' advice and seeking a second opinion			1
@entity7 , 34 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , feared the worst when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer just five months ago			1
doctors said her only chance of survival was to have a hysterectomy to remove her womb – but this would ruin her chances of ever becoming a mother			1
devastated - and desperate to keep her fertility - ms @entity7 began researching other options online			1
she was diagnosed with cervical cancer five months ago			1
she is pictured here before being diagnosed ms @entity7 ( pictured before her diagnosis ) was told her only option of survival was a hysterectomy to remove her womb , which would leave her infertile			1
devastated , she began researching other options online she found she was eligible for a second opinion and for a trachelectomy procedure			1
this removes the cervix and upper vagina , but leaves the womb in place so does n't harm fertility ( she is pictured before surgery ) the trachelectomy procedure to remove the cancerous tumour , is performed through a combination of keyhole and vaginal surgery			1
pictured are ms @entity7 's scars following the operation , which was a success she found she was entitled to a second opinion and that another operation existed that could cure her cancer but would n't destroy her chance of motherhood			1
ms @entity7 eventually underwent a trachelectomy – a procedure which removes the upper part of the vagina and the cervix , but without damaging fertility as the womb is left in place			1
she documented her entire cancer journey through her blog and hopes that by sharing her story , other women will seek a second opinion			2
ms @entity7 , an air hostess , said : ' i am over the moon to be cancer free in time for the @entity69			1
' i still do n't believe i 've actually managed to beat cancer			2
' since my diagnosis in july , i have had to battle with doctors to get the right treatment plan			0
' if i was n't so persistent about getting a second opinion , i would be infertile now			0
' beating cancer was always my main goal but i wanted children in the future and i knew deep down there was a way to keep my dream alive			2
' cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35			1
ms @entity7 , who has never missed a regular smear test , first noticed something was wrong when she began bleeding after sex			2
ms @entity7 is now in remission , meaning she is cancer free , but will have to go for regular check ups every three months for the next two years			1
she is pictured here as a bridesmaid , before being diagnosed cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35 , according to @entity93			1
rates of the disease had decreased by nearly half between the late 1980 ’s until the early 2000s			0
but the last decade has seen an increase in rates in younger women			0
the disease is caused by the human papillomavirus virus , which is spread during intercourse			0
worldwide , more than 527,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2012 , with incidence rates varying across the world			1
survival is higher in women diagnosed at a younger age			2
ninety per cent of women diagnosed with cervical cancer under age 40 survive for at least five years			1
however women under 25 in the @entity113 are not offered a smear test as cervical cancer is deemed so rare in women that young			1
the lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the @entity118 on @entity119 ( @entity120 ) advised the @entity121 in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good			2
however campaigners argue that with more young women suffering from the disease - the age should be lowered or smear tests at last be made available on request			0
she said : ' i 'd had a smear test just eight months before so i was n't too concerned but when it happened a second time i started to worry			2
' i was living in @entity135 at the time and two weeks later i booked in to see my regular doctor			0
' just weeks later i was diagnosed with cervical cancer , i booked a flight home the same day			1
' i needed to be with my friends and family in @entity142 order to beat the disease			0
' terrified , she had to wait a week for an mri scan before she was told how advanced her cancer was			2
she said : ' i was luckily diagnosed with the early stages of cervical cancer but i still needed surgery to remove the tumour			1
' i underwent a minor operation to remove the cancerous tissue from my cervix but doctors then found another deadly tumour			2
' i was then told me that my only option of survival was to have a hysterectomy			1
' i was devastated as i really want to be a mother one day and to have that suddenly ripped away from me was heart breaking			0
' she urges other women in the same situation to seek a second opinion and carry out their own research , as this is how she found out about the trachelectomy surgery that meant she could save her fertility			2
' after seeking a second opinion i found that i could keep my fertility , i was so relieved i burst into tears , it was life changing , ' she said			0
' i had wanted a trachelectomy from the beginning of my cancer journey but surgeons recommended the minor operation instead			2
' i am over the moon to be cancer free in time for the @entity69 , ' she said			0
she is pictured ( left ) celebrating the good news ( right ) in hospital for her trachelectomy procedure ms @entity7 ( pictured centre ) just before her surgery , now urges other women to ask for a second opinion			1
' if i was n't so persistent about getting a second opinion , i would be infertile now , ' she said for some women with a very early cancer of the cervix , it may be possible to have a trachelectomy			1
in this type of surgery the cervix and the upper part of the vagina are removed , but the rest of the uterus ( womb ) is left in place			1
the lymph glands in the pelvis are also removed			0
the operation may be done as an open operation of through a combination of keyhole and vaginal surgery as the uterus is not removed , a trachelectomy allows for the possibility that the woman could have children			2
during the operation or during pregnancy , a stitch is made at the bottom of the uterus to keep it closed			0
there is a significantly higher chance of miscarriage or premature delivery after this procedure and the baby will be delivered early by caesarean section			0
@entity226 is only suitable for women with early stage cancer of the cervix			2
this type of surgery is not common and is only done in @entity232			0
women interested in discussing this procedure should ask their gynaecologist to refer them to a specialist hospital			0
source : @entity239 's @entity238 ' if i had just been given what i thought was best in the first place i would n't of had to go through two operations and weeks of sleepless nights			0
she underwent the operation at the beginning of december and is now cancer free			0
she said : ' i was so happy when i found out on december 18 that i was in the clear			0
' it was a miracle that i had managed to keep my fertility but i fought so hard to be given the right procedure			0
' i hope other women read my story and seek a second opinion , i have changed my future			0
' even though i 've recently separated from my husband i hope one day to have children and that has always been something i have dreamed of			0
' ms @entity7 has documented her entire cancer journey online so she can help other women who are going through something similar			1
she said : ' i started my blog just days after i was diagnosed , i was keen to get my thoughts written down			0
' my experience of avoiding a hysterectomy was a difficult one , in some cases it ca n't be avoided but i would always recommend researching your options as it can be life changing			1
she is now in remission , but will have regular check - ups every three months for the next two years			0
' i ca n't wait to start 2015 , i feel as though my life has just started over again and i 'm excited to make plans for the @entity69 , ' she said			0
' when i was first diagnosed i never imaged i 'd be cancer free and still able to have children just months later			1

@entity7 , 34 , was diagnosed with cervical cancer five months ago
she was told her only option of survival was a hysterectomy
this would remove her womb and leave her unable to ever have children
after researching other options , she opted for a trachelectomy instead
this removes the upper vagina and cervix but does n't damage fertility
cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35
