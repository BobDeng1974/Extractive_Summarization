by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 04:45 est , 2 september 2013 three @entity3 soldiers were killed by a massive bomb in @entity5 that the @entity6 spent three weeks planting below a road , it emerged today			1
terrorists dug a tunnel under a key route through @entity11 and then pulled a wire to detonate the 450lb weapon with devastating results as an @entity16 vehicle passed over it last april			1
the bomb killed corporal @entity18 , 30 , fusilier @entity19 , 21 , and private @entity20 , 25 , the first troops to die travelling in the @entity16 ’s heavily - armoured 23 - ton @entity23 vehicles			1
six other soldiers were injured by the @entity6 attack			2
tragedy : the @entity6 also took the life of private @entity43 , from the 7th @entity44 ( 7 @entity34 ) military sources said at the time that the blast did not appear to have penetrated the £ 1million @entity23 ’s armour			1
instead , the casualties were apparently caused by the vehicle being blown into the air and the force of the impact when it landed and rolled on to its roof			1
' it 's an arms race , they build bigger bombs , we build better vehicles and so on			0
bit there can always be a bigger bomb , ' a military source told @entity63 today			2
@entity65 – nicknamed @entity64 – who was born in @entity66 , @entity34 , was described as a ‘ shining example of a soldier and a rising star ’			0
his wife @entity70 said : ‘ i am completely devastated but extremely proud of @entity64			0
i have lost the love of my life			0
’ fusilier @entity73 , from @entity75 , was described as a ‘ vastly impressive soldier ’			2
his family said they were ‘ completely devastated ’			0
@entity79 had represented @entity34 at lacrosse and was said to have ‘ epitomised everything that is excellent about the reserve forces ’			0
the men and their six comrades were on a routine patrol in the @entity88 - e @entity87 district of @entity11 province when they were attacked			1
their deaths took the number of @entity3 soldiers killed in @entity5 to 444			1
targeted : three @entity3 soldiers were killed in @entity5 when their @entity23 armoured vehicle which was introduced to protect troops was devastated by a huge roadside bomb ( file picture ) at the time @entity98 confirmed he wanted defence chiefs to look into whether the right equipment was being used to cope with such attacks			1
he said : ‘ we have done an enormous amount to improve the quality and quantity of protective vehicles that our soldiers use out in @entity5 and , as i understand , it had a pretty good record of withstanding blasts from ieds			2
' i ’m sure we ’ll want to look at that carefully and put in place everything we can to make sure that our brave men and women have the best protective equipment they have			0
‘ the troops have said to me they were pretty satisfied with what they had , but we must always look at this			2
’ the prime minister added that the @entity3 had paid a ‘ very high price ’ for the work to stabilise @entity5			0
scene : the soldiers were on a routine patrol in the @entity88 - e @entity87 district of @entity11 general @entity134 , the former head of the @entity16 , said : ‘ the @entity6 have found a way of countering the protective qualities of the @entity23			1
it would seem that this was an extremely large bomb that was so powerful it was able to cause fatalities within the vehicle itself			2
’ the attack came three days after the @entity6 launched its ‘ spring offensive ’ against coalition forces			0
the @entity6 said they would infiltrate ‘ enemy ranks ’ to conduct ‘ insider attacks ’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers			0
the ied , which may have been dug into the tarred road surface when it softened during the winter , could have been detonated remotely			0
the @entity23 carries electronic counter-measures to jam remote - controlled ieds , and investigators will check for links between the massive blast and @entity153 which is suspected of providing the @entity6 with bomb training as well as equipment and techniques to avoid jamming devices .			1
