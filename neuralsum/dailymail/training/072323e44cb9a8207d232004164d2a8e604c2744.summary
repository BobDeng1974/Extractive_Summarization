by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 17:48 est , 10 october 2013 angry : @entity1 condemned the inflation - busting price rise from @entity3 a @entity5 energy minister last night called for a boycott of @entity8 ’s second biggest energy firm after it put up bills by an average of £ 111 a year			1
as a winter chill swept across the country , @entity3 said tariffs will rise by an inflation - busting 8.2 per cent for its 7.3million customers			1
the increase will take their annual bill close to £ 1,500 , leaving millions facing a nightmare choice between heating and eating			0
energy and business minister @entity1 condemned the increase and advised @entity3 customers to switch to a cheaper rival			1
the firm hit back , blaming government green taxes and associated measures for pushing up bills			1
it said ministers should shift the cost of subsidising green energy , such as building wind farms , away from bills to general taxation			1
labour leader @entity37 seized on the news to justify his promise to impose a 20 - month freeze on energy prices if he is elected in 2015			1
however , mr @entity37 is vulnerable on the issue after he championed green taxes when he was energy secretary in the last @entity45 government			1
the @entity3 price rise comes into effect on november 15			1
other major suppliers , such as @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , are expected to announce large increases within days			0
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i would encourage all customers to look again at their tariffs and see if they can switch to a cheaper tariff			1
it is important that consumers have the power and information to be able to switch accounts			0
we are encouraging that by simplifying the tariff structure			0
’ the wholesale price of energy , which makes up half the bill , is up by 4 per cent compared to a year ago			1
in theory , this should put bills up by only 2 per cent			0
@entity3 said it was increasing prices by 8.2 per cent because green taxes , which make up 10 per cent of the bill , have jumped by 13 per cent in a year			1
@entity3 said it was increasing prices by 8.2 per cent because of green taxes secondly , the amount companies are charged to maintain and improve the national grid of cables and pipes , which equates to 25 per cent of the bill , is up 10 per cent in a year			1
much of this work is associated with green energy			2
the company said removing the green tax element from bills and transferring the cost to general taxation would reduce the annual figure by £ 110			0
@entity37 was the architect of the green taxes blamed for pushing up energy bills			1
the @entity45 leader was in charge of energy policy in @entity91 ’s @entity45 government , and made tackling climate change his main priority			2
he argued that imposing green taxes on consumer bills was vital to raise the money needed to fund a shift to wind farms and other renewable energy			2
in november 2009 , he said he fully understood that this policy would push up bills , but argued it was a price worth paying			2
mr @entity37 said : ‘ it needs a willingness to take the argument to people about the tough choices involved in tackling climate change			0
' this is the starting point : a willingness to engage with people on , for example , the fact that to deal with the problem of climate change , energy bills are likely to rise			1
’ in january 2010 , he promised to push ahead , saying : ‘ yes , there are upward pressures on energy bills , and that makes life difficult for people , including those in fuel poverty , but it is right that we go down the low - carbon energy route			2
’ now , mr @entity37 is presenting himself as a champion of those suffering from the high cost of heat and light , demanding a 20 - month price freeze			2
@entity3 group managing director @entity134 apologised to customers but accused politicians of pushing up costs			1
‘ we know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us , ’ he said			1
‘ but over many years policy - makers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government			0
' they ca n’t expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies , the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free			2
’ mr @entity37 ran the @entity154 in the last government and was behind the green taxes driving up bills			0
now , he is trying to win over voters by promising a price freeze			2
yesterday , he said : ‘ this latest scandal shows why the government needs to act			0
the companies are trying to blame everyone else , the government is trying to blame everyone else			0
they ’re responsible , they ’re not getting a grip			0
’ yesterday , @entity167 dismissed the @entity169 ’s price freeze promise as a ‘ con ’			2
‘ he is not in control of the worldwide price of gas and so he ca n’t guarantee keeping that promise , ’ he said			0
‘ what we need to do is make changes to the energy market to make sure we can have low prices and hopefully keep those low prices for as long possible			0
' we ’ve got to address the causes of prices rather than just come up with what is effectively a con			0
’ consumer bodies slammed @entity3 ’s price rise			1
@entity187 director @entity186 said : ‘ sse and others who follow need to demonstrate why this rise is justified			0
‘ but the government also has to acknowledge that energy policy costs are adding to consumer bills and carbon taxes will make that burden heavier still			1
’ executive director at which ? , @entity203 , added : ‘ we want the government to intervene to make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check			0
we need simpler pricing , we need to break the stranglehold of the biggest energy companies			0
and the government must make sure that its own policies are not adding unnecessary costs to consumers ’ bills			0

@entity1 condemned price hikes by energy giant @entity3
he has urged *homeowners* to look elsewhere for a better deal
but @entity3 blamed politicians for pushing up costs
