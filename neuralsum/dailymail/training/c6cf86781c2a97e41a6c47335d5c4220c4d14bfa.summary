it could be the solution to the stress of commuting – and even mean the end of those apologetic calls home from stranded trains or the ‘ car park ’ on the @entity7			2
this motorised paraglider comes in a suitcase , is put together in ten to 15 minutes and can soar above the queues for up to three hours			0
it features a propeller , a small engine and a reinforced polyester wing and is the brainchild of tv adventurer @entity16 , who has developed the machine with @entity20 - based company @entity19			1
@entity21 developed the @entity22 with @entity20 based company @entity19 the pilot is attached to the engine with a harness and needs a run - up of just 65ft to take off and even less to land			1
he controls the machine by pulling handles to steer it left or right and using a throttle to climb or descend			1
even if the engine cuts out , the ‘ wing ’ should be able to glide to safety			0
the aircraft can be packed and stowed in a car boot			0
or a commuter could carry the harness like a backpack into the office , while carrying the other parts in lightweight bags			0
@entity41 - man @entity16 , 40 , said of his £ 12,800 machine : ‘ it ’s like being lifted off the ground and then soaring like a bird			2
you swoop in to land , before touching down on your feet			0
and there are no hard parachute landings like we used to have in the military			0
’ it can reach 35mph , depending on the weather , and has a range of about 100 miles – the equivalent of @entity57 to @entity58 , or @entity59 to @entity60			1
grylls flew an earlier version to the top of @entity64 , and similar machines have crossed the @entity66			1
the adventurer , left , used a similar machine to cross the @entity66 and even fly over @entity64 , although it is so small it can even be packed up and put into the boot of a car , right although aimed at the adventurous , the @entity71 has already been employed for more routine journeys			1
staff at @entity19 , based in @entity74 , have used it to fly to work , and one made an impressive entrance at a dinner party by landing on a lawn already dressed in his tuxedo			2
