lovebirds : @entity2 staff release the pair of reunited @entity5 black swans on to @entity7 lake , in @entity7 , @entity8 after seven years together , their romance came to an abrupt end last summer when constant ' squabbling ' meant they had to be separated			1
but a pair of swans is having another go at making love work , as they were released into @entity7 together			1
it is well known that swans mate for life , but the pair of @entity5 black swans began to concern park staff with their feisty attitude towards each other			1
the staff were eventually forced to intervene in the domestic , moving the female to another pond in @entity7 and leaving the male on his own			1
the separation clearly affected the male , who was seen searching and calling for his mate after her removal , according to @entity2 staff			2
@entity34 , the gardens ' assistant manager , told the @entity36 : ' the male and the female tend to mate for life so it was a little unusual that they fell out			0
' but in spite of their unusual acrimony , he said the couple 's return was a success			0
he added : ' we 've had a good release of the swans , with a little bit of a delay looking out on to the water , then we stepped in and i think they look very happy and very glad to be back to their rightful home			0
' love on the lake : the pair of swans had been together for seven years when they were separated by park staff after squabbling last summer the unusual breed of swan was initially brought to the @entity66 from @entity5 in private wildfowl collections but many of the birds are thought to have escaped and now breed across the country			1
but behind their attractive black feathers and red beaks , the birds are said to be much more aggressive than their @entity66 relatives			0
@entity75 , from the @entity76 told the @entity77 in 2009 that the birds were now ' cropping up all over the place '			0
he added : ' we have been surprised by the numbers we have found ... some people would be upset if you said black swans might be killed , but others see them as a serious threat to biodiversity			2
they compete with other species for food and habitat and are quite aggressive			0
