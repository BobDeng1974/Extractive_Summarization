by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 14:54 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 14:54 est , 20 january 2013 @entity3 and the @entity4 face a decades - long battle against @entity7 terrorism in @entity8 , a grim - faced @entity2 warned today			0
the prime minister said the attack was a ' stark reminder ' of the threat from the region , which he likened to that from @entity16 and @entity17 - and vowed to use @entity3 's chairmanship of the @entity20 group of leading nations to shape the international response			1
government sources played down the prospect of @entity3 ' boots on the ground ' in support of a @entity29 - led intervention against terrorists in @entity31 but said a new approach was needed to address @entity8 's ' huge , lawless , ungoverned spaces '			1
@entity2 said the threat of @entity36 fundamentalism in @entity8 will require a ' global response ' the prime minister , who will address the @entity39 again on the crisis tomorrow , said : ' this is a global threat and it will require a global response			1
' it will require a response that is about years , even decades , rather than months			0
' it requires a response that is patient and painstaking , that is tough but also intelligent , but above all has an absolutely iron resolve and that is what we will deliver over these coming years			0
' what we face is an extremist , @entity7 , @entity54 - linked terrorist group			0
just as we had to deal with that in @entity17 and in @entity16 so the world needs to come together to deal with this threat in @entity8			0
' it is linked to @entity54 , it wants to destroy our way of life , it believes in killing as many people as it can			2
we need to work with others to defeat the terrorists and to close down the ungoverned spaces where they thrive with all the means that we have			0
' @entity29 defence minister @entity67 described the bloodbath in @entity69 as an ' act of war '			1
the @entity29 media have dubbed the bloody siege as ' @entity73 's september 11			1
' ' what strikes me the most is that we 're saying " hostage - taking " but when there are so many people concerned , i think this is an act of war , ' he said			0
speaking on the @entity83 's @entity82 , @entity84 , the foreign secretary , said it was ' quite likely ' that some of the @entity3 were executed by the group , which identified itself as the @entity88 â€“ a splinter group of @entity54 in the @entity90			1
mr @entity84 confirmed that @entity3 had not been consulted about the @entity69 decision to launch the attack , adding : ' of course , we would have liked to have been consulted , but they decided as a sovereign country that this was something on their soil that they would deal with and that they needed to deal with urgently			1
' he said the @entity69 had acted swiftly because their military believed the hostage - takers were planning to blow up the installation , posing an imminent threat to the lives of their captives			1
foreign secretary @entity84 told @entity108 of @entity109 's the @entity82 that the @entity69 army had believed the entire installation where the hostages were being held was going to be destroyed government sources sought to downplay the significance of a recording of one of the terror leaders , @entity116 , saying ' i have spoken to the @entity3 ' in recording of talks with @entity69 @entity121			1
initial contacts are thought to have been made by @entity123 , which runs the refinery where the hostages were taken			0
but officials say there was ' no question ' of negotiations over any concessions being demanded by the group			0
' whatever people think of them , whatever has been said about the @entity69 military , they are experienced , ' mr @entity84 added			1
' the @entity69 had to make very difficult decisions			2
we know from decisions about hostage rescues how very , very difficult they are			0
' the @entity69 believe that the plan of the terrorists was to blow up the entire installation thereby killing all or most of the hostages in any case and so yes , what they have done has been driven by the belief that negotiation could n't succeed and that the lives of the hostages were in great and imminent danger in any case			2
' in what appeared to be a concerted effort to row back from initial criticism of the @entity69 response , the prime minister said responsibility for the deaths ' lies squarely with the terrorists who launched a vicious and cowardly attack '			1
' no one should underestimate the difficulties of responding to an attack on this scale with 30 terrorists absolutely determined to take lives , and we should recognise all the @entity69 have done to work with us and to help and co-ordinate with us , and i 'd like to thank them for that , ' he said			2
former defence secretary @entity172 said the ' squeeze ' on @entity54 in their heartlands of @entity17 and @entity16 had forced them into other ungoverned areas			2
former @entity177 said @entity3 needed to be ' very careful how we tread in this particular area '			0
he said : ' there is a tendency to characterise this as some sort of global jihadist campaign when , in fact , in many circumstances in many of these areas			0
