by @entity1 reporter a magistrate has warned that @entity5 's ' soft touch ' justice system will turn householders into vigilantes after his own home was torn apart by burglars			1
@entity10 , 36 , said ' every man should have the right to defend his castle ' after he returned home from picking up a pair of airline tickets to discover it had been broken into , trashed and looted of valuables including his wedding ring			1
during the daylight raid , a rear window was torn from off its hinges with a crowbar before the gang climbed into the house , breaking a dining table			1
@entity10 a magistrate from @entity28 , @entity29 whose house was burgled in broad daylight said criminals ' just do n't care ' about offending they tore doors off wardrobes and cupboards before stealing the gold jewellery , a watch and electrical goods including a @entity38 , a @entity40 laptop , a @entity42 mobile phone and a digital camera			1
mr @entity10 later took pictures of the aftermath of raid which is said to have cost almost £ 10,000			1
today the father of three , a bus driver who sits one day a week at @entity50 in @entity29 said : ' the levels of policing have gone down since the cutbacks and that 's crazy when you hear about these public service executives being paid thousands			1
' people will naturally want to protect their property but i fear they will then become vigilantes and will probably get done in court for it			1
the street where mr @entity10 lives			1
the father - of - three said he believed the offenders were targeting his home for gold , following similar burglaries of @entity70 households the mess left after the break in			1
mr @entity10 later took pictures of the aftermath of raid which is said to have cost almost £ 10,000 ' if i had been in my house when these people came in and i had knocked one of them out i would be inside for assault and i do n't think it 's fair			1
every man has a right to defend his castle and if we gave powers to the public i think the crime will drop			1
' within my job i see these criminals come before me and they seem to know more law than their solicitors about equal rights and human rights and they can get away with a lot of things			1
' they know we can only give them a slap on the wrist , it 's very frustrating for me - we want to throw the book at them but prison is regarded a last resort			1
' we try fining them but then they say they can only pay £ 5 a week because they are on benefits			2
' the laws have gone too lenient			2
in some cases everything points to custody but then they say they have medical problems and then they ca n't do paid unpaid work because they have a bad back			2
by the end its a conditional discharge			2
during the daylight raid , a rear window was torn from off its hinges with a crowbar before the gang climbed into the house , breaking a dining table the other day there were 16 cases and 11 of those where burglary either from a shop or a dwelling			1
i know when i sit again and a case like this comes up and i will be frustrated			2
' obviously i can not and will not take my frustrations out on others in court but sometimes we walkaway from court disheartened - especially when you see the criminals go away laughing			2
' it is thought the burglars had been circling mr @entity10 's neighbourhood in a car before stopping at his property and then knocking on his front door to establish he was not at home			1
police are now examining @entity151 footage of the raid which was captured by cameras at a neighbouring property			1
mr @entity10 whose wife was away in @entity156 at the time of the raid said : ' obviously these criminals are not frightened and do n't seem to care - given they just walked into my house off a busy road in broad daylight			1
' i was out for less than an hour and when i came home about 2pm all the computer gear was on the floor			1
when i went upstairs , it was like a bomb had hit the place			2
' the room was topsy - turvy , doors were hanging off , the bed was on its side , they had even used a knife and ripped the suitcases apart looking for gold			2
' i even found a knife upstairs so they 'd obviously been into the property with a knife			2
i 'm just glad my wife was n't in because they could have just barged past her and threatened her			0
i 'm glad she did n't see it			0
' cctv cameras caught them outside the house in a blue @entity190 focus			0
they parked up and then an @entity70 knocked on the door and waited for about two or three minutes			0
' the car was driven around and came back and another camera picked them up going on the backstreet			0
they were even pictured walking out of the property with the laptop and computer in their hands - it was sickening			0
' they absolutely ransacked the place , it 's very upsetting			0
' i used to see a lot of police presence around here			0
police cars would even be around at night time and you would feel safe - but it 's not safe around here any more			0
' the police presence used to be fantastic and you knew that there were there			0
now i ca n't say that they are not doing their job right if they do n't have the funding			0
' we used to see a bobby on the beat every day and we used to know him			0
now i do n't know who the local bobby is			0
' i think even the police are frustrated because they have such a high workload and different teams			0
when they should be out investigating a burglary they are stuck doing paperwork and ca n't do it			0
' victim support rang me up - but i do n't want that			0
i want the police to find the burglars			1
i have since been sleeping in the back room since it happened in case they come in again			0
' @entity244 , police and crime commissioner for @entity29 , said : ' keeping people safe , especially those who are most vulnerable , remains my utmost priority			0
' both the chief constable and i remain committed to neighbourhood policing and recognise their vital presence in building safe and confident communities			0
' @entity253 said : ' anyone with information should call us			0
