@entity0 hopes @entity1 will become less reliant on in - form team - mate @entity2 during the course of the season			1
not for the first time in this campaign , @entity6 put in an outstanding display at @entity10 to help @entity1 record a 3 - 0 win over @entity13 on sunday			1
the man of the match saved two close - range efforts from @entity17 and also tipped @entity19 's fierce shot on to the bar in the second half			1
@entity0 has been impressed by @entity6 's form this season , but he would prefer it if his compatriot was not so busy			1
' we won , among other things , thanks to the man of the match @entity2 , who has had yet another great performance , ' the @entity1 midfielder wrote on his blog			1
' he is in top form			2
everybody 's praising him and now we have to keep working so we do n't need so many saves from him in the next few games ; we have to get better in that regard			2
' many questioned sir @entity60 's decision to sign @entity6 in 2011 after he made a number of costly errors in his first season			1
but he is now regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world alongside the likes of @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
' it 's tough to find anyone better than him , ' @entity0 added			1
' he 's been in top form since the beginning of the season and has saved a lot of points for us			0
' @entity2 gives us complete confidence			1
@entity13 created chances and they did n't score because of him			1
' @entity6 is being likened to @entity80 goalkeeper @entity68 and @entity81 's @entity70 @entity19 blasts his first - time shot goalwards but @entity83 ace @entity6 tips it on to the crossbar the reflex save to nudge @entity19 's powerful volley on to the woodwork from point - blank range was impressive , but the pick of @entity6 's saves came in the second half when he denied @entity17			1
the @entity13 forward picked up on a short backpass from @entity94 and attempted to round @entity6 , but the @entity95 remained on his feet and jockeyed his opponent wide , forcing him into a weak shot			1
former @entity1 defender @entity99 believes the former @entity100 has a psychological edge over any opponent who runs at him			0
' he is in imperious form , ' said @entity99 , who played 455 times over 12 years at @entity1			0
' he dictated to the striker in one - on - ones and now looks like he is in strikers ' heads if he faces them			0
' the way he trains is now being reflected in his performances			0
dedicated hard work and an unbelievable confidence in his ability as a keeper			2
' @entity6 's progress has not gone unnoticed by @entity115 , who are keeping close tabs on his contract situation			2
@entity1 , however , hope the player will sign an extension to his current contract , which expires in 18 months ' time			0
@entity0 has warned his @entity1 team - mates that they must keep working hard @entity0 , meanwhile , is refusing to get carried away despite a sixth successive win , which keeps @entity1 in third place , eight points behind leaders @entity81			1
' the team has to keep working as we did in the last few weeks , ' said @entity0 , who scored the second goal on sunday			2
' that 's why we are improving			0
in just a few days we play against @entity132 in a stadium with a very good atmosphere , where winning is always tough , and right after that we will be in @entity135			0
' we have to maintain this positive streak and try to get as many points as possible this month			0
' @entity0 acknowledged he was offside when he nodded in @entity1 's second after a @entity140 flick - on			2
' i was fortunate to score again , ' said the former @entity81 man , who has scored five times this season despite not being a regular starter			0
' to be honest , i watched the footage and it 's true that i 'm offside after @entity140 's header			0
that is something you do n't realise when you are on the pitch			0

@entity2 was *awarded* the @entity154 after @entity13 win
