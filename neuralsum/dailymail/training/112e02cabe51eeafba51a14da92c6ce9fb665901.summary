it may sound about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike or a chocolate fireguard , but one inventor hopes we will soon be riding around on a bike with no pedals			2
using the @entity8 is as easy as a walk in the park , as you simply sit back astride its single wheel and stride along			1
@entity14 , its @entity15 - based inventor , believes the wackiest idea since the @entity17 could provide the solution to congested city centres by providing a lightweight and manoeuvrable way of travelling short distances			1
he said yesterday : ‘ it ’s a bit like a unicycle but it is more efficient			2
it ’s simplicity itself and you build up momentum very quickly			2
‘ you just lean to change direction and to stop you lean back on the seat and the brakes come on			1
‘ it uses the natural movements of the body to propel it			0
its top speed is about a jogging pace , although i ’m sure with practice you may be able to go faster			0
‘ so , it ’s a jogging speed with the effort of walking			0
i can see it being ideal for use in cities and towns			2
‘ we ’ll have a sports version as well and you could use it for games like basketball or even football			0
it ’s more efficient than a unicycle or a bicycle and easier to use			0
’ mr @entity14 believes his invention is more efficient than a unicycle or a bicycle and easier to use the 61 - year - old father of two was born in @entity69 but has spent that past 18 years living in the @entity70 , where he helped to set up the medical company @entity72			1
he said : ‘ the @entity8 is a very exciting project and i will develop it further			1
it ’s a real step forward			0
’ his original aim was to develop something more practical than a bike for travelling in city centres			0
@entity8 ( left ) was designed by @entity79 ( right ) who admits it might be difficult to use climbing a hill he said : ‘ travelling by bike has other problems – you are afraid to leave it anywhere in case it is stolen and it takes up a lot of space			1
' what i wanted to produce is something that is very simple , very light and is easy to carry around with you			0
’ he concedes climbing hills may be a problem but says : ‘ it would still be worth carrying your @entity8 uphill because you will get the benefit of it going downhill			1
and the @entity8 will be very light to carry			1

the @entity8 was designed by @entity15 inventor @entity103 - @entity14
he believes the machine could provide a solution to congestion in cities
