by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 and @entity3 @entity5 skier @entity4 opened up thursday morning about his despair at how a custody battle with a former flame was portrayed in the press			1
@entity4 told the ' @entity10 ' that it was difficult to see 11 - month - old son @entity12 thrust into the spotlight while he and the boy 's mother , former @entity16 @entity14 , 27 , hammered out the details of a temporary custody agreement in place until at least a march 31 court date			1
@entity4 , 36 , spoke from @entity21 , where he is preparing for a @entity23 event , that despite being accustomed to dealing with the press , it 's much more difficult when it involves family			1
' ' reading about them is one thing , reading about them when they ’re not true [ is another ]			0
' when they ’re completely spun in one direction all the time and having to just accept that and not fight a public battle because that ’s what the media really thrives on , ' @entity4 continued , ' that was really difficult			2
' @entity4 griped that the media used ' a tiny amount of information ' to come to far different conclusions than family court judges did , and that the press narrative put a defenseless child in an unfortunate position			1
' when it ’s about a small child who ca n’t really defend themselves or is going to have to deal with the repercussions of that in the future , that ’s a really tough thing to deal with , ' @entity4 said			0
difficult : @entity4 said that despite his being used to dealing with the media , it 's much harder when family matters are portrayed inaccurately defenseless : @entity4 also griped that his son was unfairly thrust into the spotlight and put into a position of having to deal with the ramifications of that in the future the skier also spoke about looking forward to what will likely be his final @entity78 , saying he feels his age and that he has to work harder to keep up with the younger skiers after knee surgery			1
he did add though , that going to the games with expectations lower than a medal is not why he 's hitting the slopes			0
' anything outside of the medals is not why you ’re going there , ' @entity4 said			0
his comments came one month to the day after the details of a custody agreement between he and @entity14 were made public			0
the temporary custody agreement in place until at least march 31 allows the skier to take the child to the @entity78 next month in @entity97			1
@entity4 and @entity14 had a brief relationship last year in @entity99 but he has since married professional volleyball player @entity100			1
agreement : @entity5 skier @entity4 , center , exits family court , monday , december 9 , 2013 , in @entity104 shared custody : @entity4 and former flame @entity14 , pictured , agreed to share time with their infant son for four months the case became a cause for women 's rights advocates after a judge castigated @entity14 for moving while pregnant to @entity104			1
she 's studying at @entity114			0
the boy , who @entity4 calls @entity116 in honor of his late younger brother , will spend time with his mother while she pursues her studies			2
case referee @entity122 of the @entity123 approved the agreement , issuing a temporary order after a short conference in her courtroom			0
' i 'm happy to see that both parties are working this out , ' @entity122 said , according to the @entity131			0
the child was not present at the courthouse			0
happy : @entity4 , 36 , and @entity14 , 27 , said , separately , after court they were happy about the arrangement , which allows the skier to take the child to the @entity78 in february in @entity97 @entity14 has had temporary custody of @entity12 since november while @entity4 was away in @entity140 and @entity141 seeking to qualify for his fifth @entity78			1
the child attended his father 's season opener in @entity145 in october , when @entity4 had temporary custody			1
the former lovers met through an online dating service in @entity99 and went on several dates before @entity14 discovered she was pregnant			2
by the time she informed him of the pregnancy , @entity4 was already seeing @entity100 , who is now his wife			2
some have defended @entity14 's @entity104 move after @entity154 dubbed it irresponsible because it moved the case to a different legal forum			2
the news comes after @entity100 said it was ' fate ' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they would n't have been able to spend as much time with the 11 - month - old toddler			1
@entity14 was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the @entity167 holiday , before the bitter exes and their legal teams got back in a @entity171 court last month			2
airing their views : @entity4 and his wife @entity100 , who he married shortly after ending his relationship with @entity14 , announced that she miscarried last january holding on tight : just before @entity167 , a judge overturned the previous custody ruling that gave the @entity179 the rights to the child he had with @entity14 ( pictured ) , allowing her to care for the child until december 9 @entity4 met @entity14 through the high - end dating service after they both expressed interest in settling down			1
their relationship did n't last long , however , but @entity14 discovered she was pregnant with his child by the time he had already begun dating his now - wife @entity100 , a professional volleyball player			1
@entity14 later released a text she sent to @entity4 after asking him to join her at an ultrasound appointment			2
he refused to go and wrote : ' @entity191 made this choice against my wish '			0
in october , @entity14 warned @entity4 that there was a possibility that she would be moving across the country : ' just a heads up , i met with an advisor from @entity114 today and we will probably be moving there in the fall			2
' that same month , he married @entity100 after dating for just five months and in november he submitted a ' petition to establish parental relationship ' in a @entity99 court , identifying himself as the father of a child who was not yet born			1
@entity4 and @entity100 announced that she was pregnant weeks later , only to reveal shortly after that she had a miscarriage			2
@entity100 and i had n't planned on getting pregnant , but we were excited			0
in hindsight , now , we can see what an incredible challenge having two babies would have been			0
i do n't believe in fate - that everything happens for a reason - but @entity100 does , ' @entity4 said in an interview with @entity222 , a portion of which is online			1
that reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to @entity4 's son with @entity14 , even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names			1
@entity14 calls him @entity12 after giving the boy @entity4 's legal name , @entity234 , when she gave birth to him in @entity104 last february			1
fighting for his son : @entity4 and his wife had custody of the boy , who they refer to as @entity241 while his mother calls him @entity12 , for months leading up to the reversal before @entity167 evolving : @entity100 , a professional volleyball player , got pregnant expectantly but had a miscarriage shortly after announcing it virtual guilt trip : @entity4 , his wife and his daughter @entity248 ( right ) from another previous relationship celebrated an early @entity250 last month in @entity141 when @entity14 had custody of ' @entity241 ' and he posted this photo @entity4 later petitioned a court in his home state of @entity99 to add @entity116 as a middle name in honor of his brother who died in april			1
now he and @entity100 refer to the boy as @entity241			0
the couple argued that @entity14 had been conducting a virtual smear campaign against them , and while they maintain that they have not fought back , they are changing their ways now because it will effect the skier 's career as he trains for the @entity78			1
her strike back : @entity14 posted multiple photos of she and ' @entity12 ' over @entity167 , including this one of them at the @entity272 's parade @entity4 told the @entity273 earlier that @entity14 is directly attacking his brand			2
' ( @entity14 has ) been directly attacking that			0
it 's so pointless in this case because it has no bearing on anything			0
it does n't make any difference , ' he told the paper			0
' it 's just , when you are in a position where things are n't going your way — my wife does it all the time if she 's losing a fight or something , she just switches the fight to something else that she thinks she can win at			0
just totally changes the argument to something else			0
it 's not a bad tactic			0
it 's just kind of pointless			0
' other factors weighed in on the argument , however , turning the case into a question of women 's rights as one @entity104 judge initially ruled that @entity14 was ' forum shopping ' for more favorable courts by moving from @entity99 in her third trimester			1
he awarded custody to @entity4			0
after that september 3 decision , @entity14 told the @entity314 that her ex and new wife wasted no time uprooting the boy as they came back to her apartment ' took the baby out of my arms , dropped it in a car seat and drove away			0
' a second judge then reversed that decision though the case is still ongoing with the next hearing due for march 31			0
the @entity179 arrived at the @entity171 court with ' @entity241 ' in tow last week and @entity14 took the child after the hearing as she was granted custody over the @entity167 holiday			2
bi-coastal contention : after meeting @entity4 in @entity333 , @entity14 moved to @entity104 when she was pregnant and gave birth to the boy there , but the @entity179 argue she moved to be in a more favorable state for the custody case she posted photos of she and ' @entity12 ' together in @entity104 , including one of the pair attending the @entity342 parade			1
even though he did n't have his son near him to post new photos , @entity4 did n't let the social media war stay put there : he posted an old photo of ' @entity241 ' and @entity248 , his 5 - year - old daughter from another previous relationship			1
he and @entity100 had discussed online how they were celebrating an ' early ' @entity250 in @entity141 , and the picture of ' @entity241 ' and @entity248 read : ' she 's super sad her brother is n't here to celebrate with us			2

@entity4 said the media created a far different narrative than what more than one judge determined after a series of hearings
despite his experience dealing with the press , @entity4 said it 's still difficult when it involves family - especially a defenseless child
@entity4 and the 11 - month - old boy 's mother , former @entity16 @entity14 , cemented the temporary pact in family court last month in @entity104
both parents agreed after court they were happy about the arrangement , which allows the skier to take the child to the @entity78 in february
the pair had a brief relationship last year in @entity99 after meeting online but he has since married professional volleyball player @entity100
