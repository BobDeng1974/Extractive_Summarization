by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 07:04 est , 13 march 2013 lying paralysed on the operating table , feeling every incision of the surgeon 's knife but being unable to tell them ranks high among every hospital patient 's worst fears			1
today , a new study of operations done under general anaesthetic reveals that more than 150 people lived through this nightmare in just a year			1
and a third of them were awake throughout their operation , the audit for the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) and the @entity15 and @entity16 ( @entity17 ) revealed			1
waking up during surgery is a common fear and happened to 153 people in 2011 the study asked senior anaesthetists to give the number of cases of those who were awake when they should have been anaesthetised during surgery in 2011 , and also to estimate how many such episodes of ' accidental awareness ' they had witnessed in their careers			1
more than 7,000 anaesthetists responded ( 82 per cent of those asked ) , and were also asked about how they monitored their patients ' awareness during and after operations			1
the survey showed that there were 153 reported cases of ' accidental awareness ' in 2011 , a third of whom ( 30 per cent ) said they were awake for the duration of surgery			1
not surprisingly , most of those ( 62 per cent ) said they suffered ' pain or distress ' at being awake during their operations			1
almost half of the patients ( 47 per cent ) said they were awake ' at or after the induction of anaesthesia ' , while a further quarter ( 23 per cent ) reported awareness before they had fully recovered from the anaesthesia			1
mother - of - two @entity60 , 32 , from @entity62 in @entity63 , was one of those who experienced the nightmare of waking up during an operation in 2011			1
mother of two @entity60 , 32 , woke up as her stomach was being sliced open during a four - hour operation at @entity72 's @entity71 in april 2011 miss @entity60 was at @entity72 's @entity71 to undergo surgery on her stomach and spine designed to relieve pressure on her brain			1
she says she remembers having a tube fitted into her hand and then ' going black ' , before becoming aware of the most excruciating pain			2
miss @entity60 , who was later awarded Â£ 30,000 compensation for her traumatic experience , said : ' there are no words to describe what it felt like			2
' i could feel them cutting across - it was them cutting my stomach open			2
i was unsure whether i was dreaming			2
' i could hear them talking but i could n't move at all ; i was trying to scream			2
' i tried to wiggle my toes desperately hard but i could n't move anything			2
i tried to raise my heartbeat to make them notice but they could n't notice			2
i could n't blink or anything			2
' the feeling of being trapped was worse than the pain			0
i have never experienced pure panic like it ever before			0
' i really believed i was going to die			0
it felt as if i was being tortured but was powerless to stop it			0
' miss @entity60 then remembered that when the surgeon had explained the operation to her before surgery , he had said her stomach would be cut last , so she realised she was nearing the end of the op. to distract herself , she counted every stitch and every staple that went into her stomach			0
she said : ' i could feel every stitch going in - i counted all the stitches			0
it 's infinite counting now in my nightmares			0
and then the staples afterwards : i was able to tell them exactly how many they had done			0
' miss @entity60 , remembers 40 minutes of her operation , screamed uncontrollably in recovery , and a nurse ran to get the anaesthetist			0
' the first thing i said was " i was awake " ' , she said			0
' he was mortified : straightaway he knew			0
he kept saying : " i 'm sorry , i should n't have done it			0
" ' her consultant anaesthetist had decided that day to change his usual routine , switching off the anaesthetic towards the end of the operation so that the patient would become alert faster afterwards			0
he kept his job but the hospital did not contest miss @entity60 's account			0
she went on to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder which meant she was unable to leave the house for six months , and now will not have further operations because she is not emotionally strong enough			0
while the new study 's figure of 153 cases may sound alarmingly high , the scientists who conducted the survey said previous research had shown the number of people waking up during operations was actually far higher			1
several studies have shown that one or two patients per 1,000 is actually awake during their op - a far cry from today 's study which gives a figure of one in every 15,000 general anaesthetics			1
professor @entity159 , co-author of the study and a consultant anaesthetist in @entity162 said : ' most of the cases involved the patient being aware during induction when they are being sent off to sleep or after the operation itself has finished			0
' they might feel some awareness of tugging or hear some noises			1
' he added : ' you want to make sure that they are under but you do n't want to give them too much because that is dangerous in itself			0
' risks to patients undergoing general anaesthesia are very small , and have decreased considerably in the last decades			1
' anaesthesia doctors in the @entity183 undergo the same level of training as surgeons and physicians			1
of the 3m general anaesthetics administered in the @entity191 each year , only a very small number of patients experience awareness during anaesthesia , with the majority of these occurring before surgery starts or after it finishes			1

survey looked at 3m general anaesthetics done in @entity183 and @entity16 in 2011
anaesthetists reported 153 patients who suffered ' accidental awareness '
doctors say figure is actually lower than previous studies have *suggested*
