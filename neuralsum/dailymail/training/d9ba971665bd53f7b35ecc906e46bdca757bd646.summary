a university doctoral student with acute colon cancer and his wife were refused entry on a @entity6 flight because of his attire , he wrote on his blog			1
on august 18 , @entity9 , who is working on his phd at @entity11 , was at the @entity12 with his wife waiting to board his @entity6 flight			1
however , the 31 - year - old student said he was told by a @entity6 agent that his t - shirt which read ‘ @entity17 ( sic ) ’ was making other passengers feel uncomfortable , and he was told he could not board the flight			1
booted off : @entity9 , right , and his wife , were not allowed on a @entity6 flight from @entity23 to @entity24 because of his satirical @entity26 shirt , he said @entity27 : the shirt , designed by @entity30 blogger @entity29 , reads in full : ' @entity17 ( sic ) gon na kill us all @entity27 alert level bloodred run take off your shoes moisture unsafe passage : the @entity6 pilot refused the couple 's boarding due to other passenger 's discomfort with his shirt ( file photo ) higher education : mr @entity9 is a doctoral student at @entity11 mr @entity9 , who wrote about the experience on his blog , said ‘ @entity6 gave in to ( sic ) the fears of bigots and refused to let me board a flight out of @entity12			1
’ the experience , he said , began smoothly enough			0
he and his wife made it through the @entity26 checkpoint without incident			2
they were returning back to @entity24 after the funeral for his wife ’s grandfather			2
however , at the gate for @entity6 flight 1176 , mr @entity9 said that he was stopped by a @entity6 agent who said the shirt was making several passengers as well as @entity6 employees ‘ very uncomfortable			1
’ mr @entity9 wrote : ‘ i was then questioned by @entity26 about the significance and meaning of the shirt			1
i politely explained that it was “ mocking the security theatre charade and over-reactions to terrorism by the general public — both of which we 're seeing right now , ironically			0
” ' the agents inquired as to the meaning of the term “ @entity27 ” ( which means @entity78 ) and who it was that i thought was “ gon na kill us all			0
” without incident : mr @entity9 and his wife had passed through the @entity26 checkpoint without incident protect our shores : the @entity26 was formed in 2002 following the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks ‘ as best i could tell , they seemed to find my explanation that i did n’t think anyone would be killing us all and that i was poking fun at overwrought , irrational fears exhibited by certain members of the flying public to be satisfactory			1
' and moreover , they clearly deemed my shirt to be no legitimate threat			0
’ the security agent then told him he would need to change his shirt , and that he and his wife would have to go through additional screening ahead of the flight			1
he and his wife were then re-inspected by three @entity26 agents , who photographed his shirt and went through their luggage again			1
you or me : mr @entity9 was live - tweeting his experiences , saying that even after he changed his shirt , he was not allowed to board in retrospect : he then followed up with this tweet the next day , but was let on a 10am flight back to @entity24 after the inspection , they allowed the couple to proceed			1
but by that point , mr @entity9 said , the @entity6 pilot would not allow them on the flight , citing other passenger ’s discomfort with the situation			1
he said he and his wife had to rent a car and drive four hours to a relative ’s house to spend the night , as @entity6 did n’t offer hotel vouchers			2
arriving at the airport the next morning , mr @entity9 had changed his shirt to one that read : ‘ @entity130 and @entity131 ’ with a sketch of the large intestine			1
poop strong : mr @entity9 , who suffers from colon cancer , showed up at the airport the next morning wearing this shirt ; he tweeted this picture from the airport departure : he and his wife were flying out of @entity12 in @entity140 following a funeral in may , days after the killing of @entity149 leader @entity148 , two @entity143 scholars heading to a conference on @entity146 fears of @entity143 were pulled from a morning flight , and were later told that the pilot had refused to fly with them aboard			1
@entity152 , a professor of @entity154 at the @entity155 , and @entity156 , @entity157 at the @entity158 , were asked to deplane @entity160 flight 5452 from @entity161 to @entity162			0
they were subjected to additional security checks after the plane had pushed back from the gate , @entity152 told @entity167 by telephone			2
after additional screening , the two men were cleared by @entity6 representatives to re-board the plane , but were then told the pilot would not take them , @entity152 said			1
@entity152 said both men had been cleared for check - in and boarding by airline and @entity26 officials during normal pre-flight procedures			2
according to a @entity26 spokesman , the decision to remove the two passengers was made by the airline			0
@entity160 , a regional partner operating as a @entity183 , apologized for any inconvenience caused , but offered no further explanation			0
the flight ' returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger 's companion			2
we take security and safety very seriously , and the event is currently under investigation , ' an airline statement said			0
the two men were headed to a @entity146 @entity157 conference where they were scheduled to lead prayers			0
this year 's conference is discussing islamophobia or fears of @entity143 and discrimination against @entity146 muslims			0
- @entity167 the 31 - year - old has battled advanced colon cancer , and apparently selected the shirt as a less - offensive option than the @entity26 screening one			1
throughout the process , the doctoral student was sharing the ordeal on social media			0
he wrote on @entity214 early in the morning on august 19th : ‘ @entity221 , “ it ’s not you , it ’s the shirt			0
” yet changing the shirt was n’t good enough and the pilot refused to let me board			2
’ wrote mr @entity9 : ‘ in short , security screenings and any other evidence - based assessment method have been deemed irrelevant			2
whatever i do , i am suspicious			0
why ? not because the shirt i ’m wearing presents some sort of legitimate threat … ' rather , the pilot and some @entity6 rep can project upon me their worst fears of what i am possibly capable of			1
if that ’s the case , why even bother with the bloated security apparatus — since @entity6 pilots have discretion to kick off passengers who 've passed multiple checks , after all ? ’ the shirt , designed by @entity30 blogger @entity29 , reads in full : ‘ @entity17 ( sic ) gon na kill us all @entity27 alert level bloodred run take off your shoes moisture ’ and shows a picture of an eagle holing a pair of trainers in one talon , and a water bottle in the other			1
the description goes on the say that the shirt may be worn to ‘ reassure your fellow citizens with a message of anxiety and suspicion , ’ but warns the buyer not to wear the shirt to ‘ an airport security checkpoint , or anywhere near a secure federal installation			0
’ @entity6 spokesperson @entity261 told @entity262 that the airline does not discriminate against any of its passengers			2
‘ we serve thousands of customers around the world , ’ she said			0
‘ @entity6 does not condone discrimination against anyone , at the same time , providing a safe and secure operation is the primary obligation to its employees and customers			0
’ mr @entity9 cited a landmark 1968 @entity274 , @entity275 , in which they found a man wearing a leather jacket which read ‘ @entity279 ’ was protected under free speech			0
in the case , the @entity280 found that the man was not conducting him in such a way that that would present a danger to anyone .			0
