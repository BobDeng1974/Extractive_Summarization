a chemical that has been linked to cancer cell growth is being used by millions of @entity3 in toothpaste every day , it has emerged			1
the company behind @entity6 insists that triclosan , which it uses to stave off gum disease , is safe to use because the toothpaste was approved in 1997 by the @entity11			1
but the toxicology documents used by the @entity11 to approve the toothpaste were only released early this year after a @entity16 lawsuit last year - and reveal the agency relied upon company - backed science to reach its conclusion , @entity12 reported			1
the 35 - page report reveals the @entity11 had concerns that triclosan could increase the risk of cancer - but @entity6 said the chemical was only problematic in large doses			1
' the recently released pages , taken alongside new research on triclosan , raise questions about whether the agency did appropriate due diligence in approving @entity6 17 years ago , ' scientists told @entity12			1
in 2010 , a student linked triclosan , which has commonly been used to reduce bacteria contamination , to reduced fertility in mice and a 2013 study linked it to lowered sperm production in rats			2
and a study from 2003 found triclosan in the urine of 75 per cent of 2,517 @entity3 - including children - who were tested by the @entity66			2
total lairs : the company behind @entity6 insists that the ingredient triclosan was approved by the @entity11 but it has emerged that the agency relied upon company - backed science to reach its conclusion despite evidence - including pages in the report showing how tests found fetal bone malformations in mice and rats - @entity6 deemed the results irrelevant because they were conducted on animals			1
' we have created a system where we are testing these chemicals out on the human population , ' scientist @entity82 told @entity12			0
' i love the idea they are all safe			0
but when we have studies on animals that suggest otherwise , i think we 're taking a huge risk			0
' dr @entity82 still , @entity6 said that the 35 pages do not prove the chemical is harmful to humans and said that its safety is proved by more than 80 clinical studies of 19,000 people			0
' in the nearly 18 years that @entity6 has been on the market in the @entity3 , there has been no signal of a safety issue from adverse - event reports , ' spokesman @entity100 told @entity12			2
he added that , while the @entity11 had been worried about the chemical 's carcinogenicity , a study in 1997 found it did not pose a cancer risk for humans			1
@entity6 said it has no plans to reformulate total toothpaste			2
the @entity11 said on its website that triclosan is ' not known ' to be dangerous to humans - but the results found in animals has given them enough of a reason to run tests again			1
drug regulators are now reviewing the dangers of the chemical , but they will only re-visit the approval of @entity6 if they find a great enough reason to			0
in a sign of the concern over the chemical , @entity128 lawmakers banned the chemical in may			0
@entity133 and @entity134 have also announced plans to cut the chemical from its products			0
