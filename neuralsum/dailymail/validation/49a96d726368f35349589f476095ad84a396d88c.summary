the @entity7 manager oversaw another disappointing performance and result in @entity2 's 2 - 1 @entity11 defeat by @entity12 at @entity5 on monday night			1
@entity13 returned to his old stomping ground to score the winner after @entity16 levelled @entity18 's strike in the first half , but it was yet another lacklustre display under @entity22 that irked @entity2 supporters			1
@entity2 's legendary midfielder @entity0 says @entity3 should get more time in charge at @entity5 @entity22 came under more criticism for another lacklustre display in the 2 - 1 @entity11 defeat by @entity12 @entity0 was in the studio with former @entity30 stars @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 their hero @entity0 , however , maintained the manager needs more time with fans unaware of what the job entails			1
' @entity22 is going to get criticised , you 'd expect that , ' @entity0 said during his @entity42 @entity44 analysis			1
' give the man a chance - two or three years			2
a lot of fans do n't quite understand how to run a football club as big as @entity2			1
' they should have given @entity50 more time but did n't			0
what are they going to do ? chop and change again ? @entity22 has been in the door two minutes			2
it 's literally a rebuilding job			0
a dismayed @entity57 ( left ) , @entity58 ( centre ) and @entity16 after @entity12 's winner @entity13 broke the hearts of his boyhood club by pouncing on an error to send @entity12 to @entity64 ' it would be a disaster if @entity2 do n't finish in top four			1
the big problem with people at the club and ex-players is they keep looking back comparing teams from 10 years ago			2
' they have got to look forward			0
focus on the players , focus on the manager ... get right behind him			0
i still think they have enough to get in that top four			0
' @entity0 's old sparring partner , former @entity80 and @entity30 striker @entity32 , was more damning			2
he said : ' @entity2 's main priority this season is finishing in the top four			0
if they do n't then it will be a catastrophe			0
' they have spent a lot of money on players			0
there 's a hell of a lot more money that needs to be spent to get them anywhere near where they want to be			0
' there is n't another team in the @entity100 that passes it back more than @entity2			1
' @entity16 's flying header to equalise for @entity2 in the first half could n't stop his side crashing out @entity106 's red card was the final blow for @entity2 as @entity22 's troops lost their heads @entity0 and @entity32 's battle of words during the @entity42 's @entity11 analysis were nothing compared to what the hot - headed duo got up to in their playing days			1
neither was a player the opposition wanted to get on the wrong side of , so no battle was more fierce than when the two clashed			0
@entity0 lashes out at @entity32 when the two came to blows at @entity124 in 2001 the former @entity2 captain named @entity32 as a player he ' always had in the back of his mind ' in his recent autobiography @entity130 alongside other famous foes like @entity132 and @entity133			1
@entity0 made it clear that although he regularly came across @entity32 while working as a tv pundit , there is little or no chance of them ever building bridges such is the mutual dislike of each other			2
@entity0 picked @entity32 out as a player he always had in the back of his mind alongside @entity132 the most famous flashpoint came in 2001 at @entity124			2
