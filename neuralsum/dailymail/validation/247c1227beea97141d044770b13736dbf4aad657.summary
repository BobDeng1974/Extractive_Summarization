if @entity1 has proven anything , it 's that big bums are big business			0
@entity1 , who was officially crowned ' world 's best bottom ' , sparked a new trend for ' bacials ' - that 's bottom facials - and caused a 45 per cent increase in bottom enhancing procedures over the last 12 months			2
and now , one high street store have created a pair of bottom - boosting jeans that promise to give you a derriere to rival the reality tv star			2
@entity20 has unveiled a £ 45 pair of bottom - boosting jeans designed by @entity23			1
@entity25 's @entity24 pitted the enhancing jeans , right , against her regular jeans , left @entity20 has jumped on the derriere enhancing bandwagon by giving customers the chance to enhance that all - important asset with a pair of £ 45 jeans			1
the new denims , designed by @entity23 , can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high - street chain			0
according to the store , the @entity41 are said to be flying off the shelves , purchased by women looking for a more shapely figure			0
@entity46 put the jeans to the test to see if they really can give you a pert posterior a @entity1 or whether it 's all just a clever gimmick			1
the new denims , right , can add up to two extra inches to your derriere compared to normal jeans , left , as modelled by 24 - year - old @entity54 @entity55 , 28 , tested out her day - to - day jeans , left , against the bottom - boosting pair , right , which have heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve the secret to the new jeans ' success ? a clever combination of cheek - enhancing cut , expert tailoring , and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve , promising to turn a shapeless bottom into rear of the year			1
control panels at the front also claim to flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect , while the position of the darts in the denim promise to give a flattering hourglass effect			2
@entity20 also say the jeans give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear			1
speaking about the jeans , a spokesperson for @entity20 said : ' pictures of curvy famous women , from @entity1 and @entity86 , to @entity87 and @entity88 , have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise , rather than minimise			1
' of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer , straight up and down silhouette			0
the only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out , but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful , instant booty boost			0
' the jeans promise to give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear , which @entity103 , 25 , tested out ( left : regular jeans , right : bottom - boosting jeans ) according to the store , the @entity41 boost bottoms thanks to a clever combination of cheek - enhancing cut , expert tailoring , and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve so what did our testers think ? @entity54 and @entity103 were impressed			1
@entity54 said : ' i ca n't say i 'm now the proud owner of a behind to rival @entity1 but i like the lift that the jeans give			0
everything is more defined and pert - and for £ 45 , that 's money well spent			1
' @entity103 added : ' the quality was really impressive and much more fitted and comfortable than my regular jeans , i think these would make a good investment piece and staple item in anyone 's wardrobe			2
' @entity24 , however , would n't waste her money			0
‘ i actually think my bum looks better in the first pair of jeans ! ' , she said			0
' the darker colour and shape seems to give my rear more definition and lift while the other pair seems to flatten it			0
