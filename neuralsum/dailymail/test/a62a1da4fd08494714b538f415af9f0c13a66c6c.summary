@entity0 fell in love with him because of his skill under pressure and his sheer bravura			0
the rest of @entity7 fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed			1
the 79th masters attracted massive ratings in the @entity7 and there is no surprise in that			1
they tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold			0
but they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household			0
politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21 - year - old @entity28 champion @entity28			1
the green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the @entity38 game			2
@entity28 wears his new green jacket after winning the masters at @entity41 on sunday @entity28 hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at @entity45 @entity28 walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on as he stepped off the final green he embraced , in turn , his father @entity56 , his mother @entity55 , his college sweetheart @entity50 , his brother @entity51 , who plays college basketball , his grandfather and various friends			1
and then he remembered his father ’s words : ‘ make sure you say thank you to the people , son			0
’ so he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space			1
with this victory , @entity28 must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner			1
you will not find a single pro on the @entity72 with a bad word to say about him			0
there is nothing fake about @entity28			1
@entity76 are supposed to be brash and larger than life , right ? this one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because , well , that would not be humble			0
listen to @entity82 , the @entity82 specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at @entity41 only once before			1
‘ he ’s just a class guy in every way and it ’s difficult not to root for him , ’ said the leftie			0
@entity28 watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round @entity28 gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day ‘ this is a momentous week in the history of our game			1
along with @entity97 , @entity28 is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be			1
’ sir @entity102 , on @entity7 television , sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week			1
listen to @entity108 , who posted this tribute : ‘ congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man			1
that was an incredible performance			0
@entity28 is so beyond his years			1
i like everything about him			0
he ’s polite , he ’s humble , he handles himself so well , on and off the golf course			0
and he ’s obviously a wonderful player and now a @entity107 champion			0
’ the one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14 - year - old sister @entity114 , who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum			0
hardly a day goes by when @entity28 does not @entity114 and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet			1
‘ i ’ll finally be able to tell her yes , ’ he said , smiling			0
when @entity28 speaks about @entity114 there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice , only joy , laughter and pride			1
‘ i know she was watching on television and i think she ’s going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green , ’ he said			1
‘ she ’s going to want a present			0
’ golf should not have been @entity28 ’s game at all			1
nobody in the family plays — they are all big basketball fans			0
but @entity28 was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there			1
@entity28 ( front ) is presented with his green jacket by last year 's masters champion @entity145 @entity28 kisses his girlfriend @entity50 after a sensational victory at the masters perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the @entity150 after his first year			1
it was well - meaning			0
by the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the @entity155 , finishing 21st			2
but why the hurry ? why not complete his education ? throughout his life @entity28 has known exactly what he wants — from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie @entity163			1
he is a maths teacher by trade but @entity28 persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway			1
@entity28 just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why			2
when he set out he was ranked 809th in the world			0
now he is no 2 behind @entity97			0
in 18 months , he has banked more than $ 13million ( £ 8.86m ) on the @entity72 alone			0
in his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says : ‘ i do n’t see this as a great run of form , i see this as normal , ’ it does not come across as at all boastful			2
@entity28 ( right ) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend @entity50 @entity28 spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister @entity114 ( centre ) and brother @entity51 ( right ) asked about @entity97 , as ever , he found exactly the right words : ‘ he ’s got four majors and numerous wins and right now that ’s something i can only dream about			2
i ’ll never hit it like he does and i have to make up for that somewhere else			0
but i ’m looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games			0
’ how on earth did golf get this lucky ? a sport with a fuddy - duddy , middle - aged image ? consider this : the world ’s top two players have an average age seven years younger than the top two in tennis			2
the game is very fortunate to have a man like @entity97			0
it is doubly lucky to have a personable 17 - year - old in @entity212 at the top of the women ’s game			0
now @entity28 has come along and golf feels truly blessed			2
@entity28 pictured in his younger days playing basketball left - handed it was with good reason that one of our competitors declared on the eve of the masters that @entity226 golf had reached the end of an era , with no players ranked in the world ’s top 10 for the first time at a major since 2008			1
but , following the encouraging events at @entity41 , there should be good days ahead			2
three players ranked in the top six was as many as the host nation , with @entity238 and @entity239 ( tied sixth ) doing enough to suggest they will win at least once each before this season is out			0
as for joint runner - up @entity242 , whose 14 - under - par total would have won 74 out of 79 masters , here ’s a prediction : over the next five years he will add at least one more major to his 2013 @entity155 win			1
@entity226 's @entity242 on the 18th green on sunday after finishing tied for second on 14 - under - par driving no contest here			1
it ’s the strongest part of @entity97 ’s game and the weakest part of @entity28 ’s			2
@entity97 10/10 @entity28 5/10 iron play @entity97 again has the edge , and particularly with the longer irons			2
@entity97 8 @entity28 7 @entity97 watches his tee shot on the 12th hole during the final round of the masters @entity262 @entity97 ’s good in this area but @entity28 is brilliant , with perfect technique and great imagination			1
@entity97 7 @entity28 9 putting when he putts well , @entity97 wins			2
but @entity28 always putts well			2
@entity97 7 @entity28 9 @entity28 ( right ) putts on the 13th green before storming to victory at @entity41 mental strength nothing to separate them in this area			1
@entity97 9 @entity28 9 verdict @entity97 41/50 @entity28 39/50 it ’s still @entity97 for me but we have to remember he is four years older , and @entity28 has been a pro for less than two years			2
the exciting thing for the game , and the frightening thing for everyone else , is they ’re both so young in golf terms and clearly only going to get better in years to come			0
@entity97 acknowledges the crowd as his bid for a first @entity286 title ends this year			0

@entity28 won his maiden major at the age of 21 at @entity41
the 79th masters attracted massive television ratings in the @entity7
@entity28 went back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the crowd
