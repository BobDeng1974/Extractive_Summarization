@entity3 shocked some attendees at the @entity18 event on friday with ' a relentless bombardment of sexist , racist , homophobic and xenophobic utterances ' , according to local website @entity21			1

he is also reported to have made an insulting comment about @entity33 mining heiress @entity11 's appearance to the startled 250 - odd crowd			0
mr @entity3 said it was upsetting that people on one table did n't see the humour as it was intended			1
' no comments were made to offend anyone , ' mr @entity3 told @entity2			1
' in fact , much of the humour was directed at myself and friends in the audience			0
' ' the next day , so many people rang me to say that they had not laughed so much for a long time			0
' mr @entity3 said he was bewildered by the focus on his comments , which he thought were ' quite tame ' compared to many stand - up comedy acts			1
the barrister said he did his best to coax as much money as possible from the audience during the event , which raised about $ 50,000 for the school			2
@entity56 president @entity55 said the barrister had hosted the event two years prior and was a popular choice for quizmaster , and had apologised to those he may have offended			0
ms @entity55 said it was only a small group of guests that were upset by some of the comments and the @entity56 had only received positive feedback about the evening , which was attended by about 260 people			0

@entity18 principal @entity72 said mr @entity3 would not be hosting events for the school ( pictured ) in the future mr @entity3 described his comments as tame compared to many other comedy acts however , principal @entity72 , who was there on the night , said in a statement that the barrister made several deeply offensive and hurtful remarks , and would not be invited to @entity13 future school events			1
' many members of the school community worked extremely hard to organise the event , ' mr @entity72 said			0
' unfortunately , the @entity13 , who is not a member of our school community and was invited by the @entity56 , made a number of remarks during the evening which were deeply offensive and hurtful			1
' i would like to state clearly that these offensive comments in no way reflect the values of our school			0
' mr @entity72 said the barrister would not be invited to mc any events at the school in the future			1
' i will be working with the school board and the @entity56 to develop stronger protocols for the hosting , compering and running of future events so these unacceptable actions do not occur , ' he said			2
