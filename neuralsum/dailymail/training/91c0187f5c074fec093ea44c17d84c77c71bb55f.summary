by @entity0 police nationwide may be listening in on phone calls or reading text messages to find suspects thanks to a device called @entity6 - but they 're refusing to reveal details about its use			1
law enforcement officials say @entity6 , a suitcase - size device that pretends it 's a cell tower , is useful for catching criminals , but that 's about all they 'll say			1
for example , they wo n't disclose details about contracts with the device 's top manufacturer , @entity17 , insisting they are protecting both police tactics and commercial secrets			1
the secrecy — at times imposed by non-disclosure agreements signed by police — is pitting obligations under private contracts against government transparency laws			0
top - secret : the @entity28 - based @entity17 manufactures stingray devices , which police departments from coast to coast are said to be using to intercept phone calls and text messages even in states with strong open records laws , including @entity28 and @entity36 , little is known about police use of @entity6 and any rules governing it			1
a stingray device tricks all cellphones in an area into electronically identifying themselves and transmitting data to police rather than the nearest phone company 's tower			1
because documents about @entity6 are regularly censored , it 's not immediately clear what information the devices could capture , such as the contents of phone conversations and text messages , what they routinely do capture based on how they 're configured or how often they might be used			2
in one of the rare court cases involving the device , the @entity59 acknowledged in 2011 that so - called cell site simulator technology affects innocent users in the area where it 's operated , not just a suspect police are seeking			1
earlier this month , journalist @entity68 and the @entity69 of @entity36 sued the @entity70 , alleging in court documents that police did n't comply with the state 's public - records law because they did not fully disclose @entity6 - related records and allowed @entity17 to dictate what information could be made public			1
the @entity6 has been credited with helping the @entity59 nab a tax fraud suspect nicknamed the @entity78 , who was later identified as 29 - year - old @entity80 man @entity79			1
censored : police are not being forthcoming with information on the use of @entity6 , regularly censoring documents about how the phone - tracking technology is used or how much it costs taxpayers @entity79 , of @entity88 , was indicted in april 2010 for allegedly stealing the identities of hundreds of dead and living people and using the information to electronically file for $ 4million in fraudulent tax returns			1
it is believed the federal officials used a @entity6 to locate the illusive computer wiz by linking @entity79 to a mobile - broadband card , which allows a computer to connect to the internet through a cell phone network , the @entity93 reported			2
the @entity59 later claimed that it obtained the appropriate court orders to track @entity79 's broadband card using an unspecified device , but the documents have remained sealed since his arrest in 2008			2
phantom : a stingray device tricks all cellphones in an area into electronically identifying themselves and transmitting data to police rather than the nearest phone company 's cell tower revelations about surveillance programs run by the federal @entity117 have driven a sustained debate since last summer on the balance between privacy and government intrusion			1
classified @entity117 documents , leaked to news organizations , showed the @entity117 was collecting telephone records , emails and video chats of millions of @entity127 who were not suspected of crimes			0
that debate has extended to state and local governments			0
news organizations in @entity80 , @entity28 and @entity133 are among those that have been denied records about @entity6 or @entity6 - like devices , including details of contracts that @entity17 has with government agencies			1
in a response to a records request from the @entity144 newspaper about @entity28 's use of cell - tracking technology , the state 's top police agency provided a four - page , heavily redacted document signed by a police investigator			1
the newspaper reported that the document referred to guidelines concerning the purchase of items and sought the department 's agreement to the ' provisions / content of the @entity157			0
' the @entity158 of @entity159 made a similar request to the @entity161 , which said it had to maintain secrecy even though the newspaper found information online about cell site simulators			0
and in @entity166 , the local sheriff 's office told a tv station it would ' be inappropriate for us to comment about any agency that may be using the technology ' in light of a @entity17 non-disclosure agreement			2
many of the requests were part of an effort to investigate the devices by @entity178 , which publishes @entity179 and owns other newspapers and television stations around the country			0
' i do n't see how public agencies can make up an agreement with a private company that breaks state law , ' said @entity188 , the director of the @entity190 's journalism school and a national expert on public - records laws			0
' we ca n't have the commercial sector running our governments for us			0
these public agencies need to be forthright and transparent			0
' a representative for @entity197 , @entity28 - based @entity17 declined to comment or elaborate on how the company 's agreements comport with open records laws			2
court documents in @entity68 's case show @entity17 ' agreement required the @entity205 city government not to ' discuss , publish , release or disclose any information ' about its products without the company 's written consent			2
the agreement also required the city to contact @entity17 when it receives public - records requests about a ' protected product , ' like a @entity6 , so that the company can ' challenge any such request in court			1
' the police department declined to comment on @entity68 's lawsuit			0
he had sought @entity17 contracts and police emails about how the technology is used			2
email records show a @entity17 contract manager advised a @entity205 police sergeant on what records could n't be released to the public ; the manager relied on the @entity127 @entity230 , which governs records of the executive branch of the federal government			0
@entity234 , a staff attorney with the @entity69 , said there 's often a distinction in public - records laws to protect bona fide trade secrets — such as circuit board diagrams — as opposed to broader information like agency policies governing a @entity6 's use or purchase agreements			1
he said police in @entity28 have declined to tell judges about the use of @entity6 because of non-disclosure agreements			0
a december 2013 investigation by @entity179 found roughly 1 in 4 law enforcement agencies it surveyed had performed tower dumps , and slightly fewer owned a @entity6			0
but the report also said 36 additional agencies refused to provide details on their use , with most denying the newspaper 's public - records requests .			0

@entity6 is a suitcase - size device that tricks cell phones into sending data to police rather than to a tower
the technology has been credited with helping @entity59 catch a *hacker* linked to $ 4million tax fraud scheme
police departments from @entity80 to @entity133 refuse to share information about contracts with @entity6 's maker , @entity17
