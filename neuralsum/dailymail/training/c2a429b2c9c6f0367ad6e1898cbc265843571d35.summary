by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity1 made the extraordinary claim to @entity4 ’s disciplinary committee that he ‘ did not bite or intend to bite ’ @entity6 defender @entity5 — but ‘ fell ’ into him			1
and his refusal to accept responsibility for the offence or even to admit that it took place appears to have backfired and resulted in the severe sanction from @entity4 — he is banned from all football for four months as well as nine international games			1
@entity1 ’s defence will come as a further embarrassment and @entity17 are now preparing to sell the player to @entity19			1
they are hoping to bring @entity21 and @entity19 striker @entity22 the other way as part of the deal			1
@entity1 submission to @entity4 said : ‘ in the run - up to the impact , my knees came together , i lost my balance and that destabilised my body and i fell into my opponent			1
in that moment , my face came into collision with the player , causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my teeth , which caused the referee to stop play			0
that is what happened and in no event did i , as is written in the document , “ bite ” or “ try to bite ”			0
’ however , the attempt to deny the incident appears to have been an enormous misjudgment by @entity1 and his legal team and resulted in a more severe sanction than if contrition been shown			2
the @entity4 disciplinary commission noted ‘ at no point did the player show any contrition or repentance of any type , nor did he admit any violation of @entity4 regulations and has therefore not shown any knowledge of having committed any offence			2
’ in applying the sanction , the committee considered ‘ the grave danger of repetition , the exceedingly abnormal nature ( of the offence ) in the context of a football match and the intention to harm the opponent			0
’ it was also noted that he had been sanctioned previously for this offence in club football			0
@entity1 ’s latest offence means he will have been banned for a total of 47 matches for three separate bites and racially abusing @entity99 ’s @entity98			2
last night , he made his first public comment since arriving back home in @entity102 , having been thrown out of the @entity28 camp by @entity4			2
in a tweet , he said : ‘ hi all , i write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love i am receiving			0
‘ both myself and my family really appreciate it			0
thank you very much for being by my side and i want all my colleagues today to know we support the national team for the match against @entity117			0
’ painful : @entity1 fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back @entity5 @entity1 will now leave @entity17 , with the @entity123 club working to extract the best possible deal from a difficult situation			1
the club will ask for £ 80million , although @entity19 and @entity1 believe the transfer can be done for £ 65m , based on a buy - out clause			1
nevertheless , @entity21 striker @entity22 could be key to negotiations			0
@entity19 are willing to sell him , @entity17 want to buy him but the player needs to be convinced and @entity132 are likely to bid , although they have not registered their intent as yet			1
@entity17 will now begin a £ 120m rebuilding project to fill the void left by @entity1			1
@entity137 ’s £ 23m move will be announced tomorrow and the @entity139 striker @entity138 will join at the @entity140 for £ 10m — although he is expected to spend next season on loan with current club @entity143			0
@entity17 will look to add £ 15m @entity145 defender @entity144 and £ 25m @entity147 winger @entity146 to their summer transfer spending , which has already included £ 9m for @entity149 and £ 4m for @entity150			0
@entity17 will be forced to end up paying @entity1 £ 3m in wages for doing nothing if they do n’t sell him this summer			1
the @entity39 is occupying the minds of owner @entity154 and the @entity17 hierarchy as they work out what to do next with their troubled striker			0
last night , the @entity159 club were poring over the @entity4 ruling handed to them by @entity1 ’s lawyers			1
the @entity123 club has its hands tied , however			0
although the @entity39 @entity38 has handed in a formal appeal over @entity1 ’s punishment , @entity17 will have to abide by @entity4 ’s final decision and can not mount their own , separate appeal			1
in addition , withholding @entity1 ’s wages while he is suspended from playing and training is not an option under agreements the @entity123 has made with the @entity173 — and @entity4 ’s own rules			1
evidence : @entity5 looked outraged as he showed the referee the apparent point of impact on his shoulder @entity1 took to @entity180 on saturday to thank his supporters and said : ' hi all , i write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love i am receiving			1
' both myself and my family really appreciate it			0
thank you very much for being by my side and i want all my colleagues today to know we support seleccion for the match against @entity117			0
' the maximum fine @entity17 can impose on @entity1 , if they have a mind to , is two weeks wages , under contracts signed with the @entity173			1
even if the players ’ union gave them special dispensation to increase the fine because of the seriousness of his offence , @entity17 could not withhold @entity1 ’s money for more than two months without @entity1 being free to move to another club — something @entity17 would not countenance for such a valuable asset			1
it leaves @entity17 having to decide whether it would be beneficial for the club to enter negotiations with @entity19 , who would like the player to form a dream attack with @entity216 and @entity217			1
if an agreement for the player to move to @entity220 can not be reached , @entity17 will have to pay @entity1 ’s £ 175,000 - a - week wages until the end of october — amounting to £ 3million — even though the player can not play , train with his team - mates or watch the team play			2
@entity1 may even choose to stay away from the country altogether and there are serious doubts about whether he will want to return to @entity229 while he is banned			2
even before his bite , the player had shown clear signs of wanting to quit the @entity123			0
he and his family left their home in @entity236 , @entity17 as soon as the final ball had been kicked at the end of the @entity123 season in may			0
by the time @entity1 was awarded the prestigious @entity241 in @entity242 four days after the end of the league season , the 27 - year - old was already in @entity19 where his in - laws live			2
the trophy was collected by @entity17 manager @entity247 instead			0
show of support : @entity28 's wags have given their backing to @entity1 following the striker 's ban message for his followers : @entity1 took to @entity180 to thank his fans for the messages of support they 'd sent thumbs up : @entity1 gestures to fans from the balcony of his home after returning to @entity28 rapturous reception : @entity1 was joined by his children as he greeted the army of fans who had gathered @entity1 ’s comments after scoring twice against @entity229 in the @entity268 clash — in which he claimed that he had been ‘ laughed at ’ in @entity269 — were also seen as stirring upanimosity and an indication of his desire to play in @entity273			2
but @entity17 owner @entity154 showed last year , when he rejected out - of - hand @entity132 ’s bid of £ 40m - and - a - pound for @entity1 , that he will only let the player go to @entity19 if they meet his market value of around £ 70million — despite this third biting offence			1
despite the furore surrounding @entity1 , @entity17 are proceeding with plans to bolster @entity247 ’ squad for next season when they will play in the @entity283 after a five - year absence			2
the protracted move for @entity137 should be finalised and announced within the next 48 hours and the club also has an interest in @entity139 striker @entity288 — who will be involved in his country ’s @entity292 quarter - final against @entity294 on tuesday			0
@entity296 defender @entity144 , @entity297 striker @entity146 and @entity299 winger @entity298 , of @entity301 side @entity300 , are also being looked at while @entity247 has stated his intention to buy a left - back , too			0
it is all part of @entity17 ’s rebuilding plan that has been complicated by @entity1 .			2
