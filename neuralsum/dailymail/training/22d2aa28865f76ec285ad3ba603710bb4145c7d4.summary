by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was quick to apply a sense of perspective after withdrawing from the @entity5 with the injury he suffered in a dramatic crash at the finish of the opening stage			1
‘ i ’ve got friends who have come back from @entity12 with the armed forces , ’ he said			0
‘ you saw my @entity16 helmet yesterday			0
' my friend @entity17 is a double amputee and missing his right arm			0
he sent me a message joking saying " i ’ve got a spare arm for you "			0
down and out : @entity2 has had to pull out of the @entity5 after injuring his shoulder ouch : prime minister @entity25 winces at the crash , which shattered the @entity28 's hopes for this year ‘ i ’ve also got friends like @entity30 , who is out for the rest of the season			1
i ’m in the left - handed club with him for a bit now but things could be worse			2
and it was my fault			2
’ the @entity28 rider was indeed at fault after trying to squeeze through a gap that just was n’t there as the riders sprinted towards the finish in @entity44 on saturday			1
he bored into @entity47 @entity46 with his head in a desperate bid to create some space , succeeding only in bringing both of them down as @entity53 @entity52 sped away for the stage win			2
after an @entity56 at a nearby hospital it emerged that @entity2 had suffered ‘ ligament ruptures with an ac - joint dislocation ’ in his right shoulder			1
yesterday morning ’s news that he had boarded the @entity63 team bus to @entity64 for the start offered a glimmer of hope			0
my fault : @entity2 has taken the blame for causing the crash as he tried to get in position for the sprint carnage : the sprinter says he knew something was wrong as soon as he hit the ground but the team then confirmed the fears of cycling fans hoping to see @entity80 sprint to glory on @entity82 at the end of today ’s third stage after failure to do so at the @entity86 in 2012			1
had he beaten @entity89 along @entity44 ’s @entity90 , it would have been his 26th stage win and his first opportunity to wear the yellow jersey			2
as it is , he is out of the race			0
after emerging from the team bus with his arm in a sling @entity2 said : ‘ i knew immediately because normally in crashes i bounce back straight away			1
my shoulder was sticking out the way it should n’t			2
‘ this was the first time in my career that i knew something was up but i wanted to finish , and i was able to do that , but i was in pain			0
i had some optimism that the swelling would go down overnight but it ’s not possible to start today			0
‘ i ’m absolutely devastated			0
firstly , the @entity5 is in the @entity108 for another two days and secondly we have an incredible team			1
’ @entity2 had accepted responsibility for the crash in a statement on saturday night			1
but he added : ‘ i spoke to @entity46 at the finish and then i called him at his hotel last night too			0
we both went for @entity117 ’s wheel but i wanted that gap so bad but it was n’t there			0
‘ i hope @entity46 is ok and today is a stage for him			2
he ’s a good guy and i wish him well for the rest of the @entity5			1
‘ i would have loved to have been here for three weeks as we have a really strong team here but the crash was my fault			1
’ it is the first time since 2008 — when he left prematurely to prepare for the @entity128 — that @entity2 will not complete the @entity5			1
the 2011 points classification winner and world champion won in @entity131 for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012			0
battling on : @entity80 gt back on his bike to finish the stage on saturday but could n't continue his tour his withdrawal means there are just three @entity108 left in the race : defending champion @entity140 , his @entity142 team - mate @entity141 and @entity143 from @entity144			2
@entity2 will travel to @entity145 today for further tests on his injured shoulder but is unlikely to watch the race			1
only after it has been established if he will require surgery will a decision be made on whether he rides at the @entity151 in @entity152			0
