by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 12:56 est , 10 april 2013 the end of the cold spell finally arrived today as the sun started to shine , and forecasters have said temperatures could be about to rise even further			1
sunday is expected to be the warmest day of 2013 so far , with temperatures reaching as high as @entity7 in parts , although they will fall again by the start of next week to what would be expected for this time of year			1
but while many took advantage of the warmer temperatures and enjoyed some sunshine today , forecasters have warned rain will spread across the @entity18 as the weather remains ' mild but a bit unsettled ' over the next few days			1
people were able to enjoy the spring sunshine on the @entity23 , in @entity24 , today , but forecasters have said the weather will remain ' unsettled ' until the weekend a couple ( left ) and a group of friends ( right ) enjoy a spot of punting on the @entity23 today underneath trees that are finally beginning to blossom people enjoy the spring sunshine as they punt past the cherry blossom trees at @entity34 , in @entity24 , today @entity35 , forecaster for the @entity36 , said : ' it has n't been too bad today for a lot of places , particularly western @entity40 and north west @entity42 - temperatures have got up to double figures			1
rare birds have been found dead in the latest sign of wildlife struggling to cope with the cold spring , conservationists have said			1
the bodies of eight stone curlews , a threatened species which migrates from wintering grounds in @entity53 and @entity54 in the spring , have been found in fields in @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 in the past few days			0
conservation charity the @entity59 said the birds are believed to have struggled to find food on their arrival to the @entity18 and were just two - thirds the weight they should have been if they were healthy			1
only around 400 stone curlew pairs are in the @entity18 , and the last two years have been poor for breeding			2
the discovery of eight dead birds , with the actual number that have died likely to be higher , is a stark reminder of how fragile the species is , @entity59 conservation director @entity70 said			0
hundreds of puffins and other seabirds were found dead two weeks ago off the coast of @entity40 and north - east @entity42 , as a result of freezing conditions and stormy weather making it hard to find food			1
nature enthusiasts are reporting little evidence of the annual influx of summer migrants which normally arrive at this time of year to build nests and breed			0
reports of chiffchaffs , willow warblers and black caps have been scarce			0
' that kind of marks the change to a fairly significant change of weather type as we head into the next few weeks			0
' admittedly , for the next couple of days , particularly in the north , it 's going to be on the chilly side in terms of the temperatures			0
we are still looking at single figure maximums , there is still cold air sitting over there , the same cold air that we have seen over the last couple of weeks , but it has been modified as we start to see rain and wind pushing in from the south and south west over the next couple of days			1
' mr @entity35 said the weather will be ' a bit unsettled ' but mild through the rest of the week			2
temperatures across much of the north tomorrow will still be below average , at about 7c to @entity118 , although it will be warmer further south , where temperatures could reach @entity121 or @entity122			0
he said : ' so we are beginning to get where we should be			0
' but he did warn outbreaks of rain in parts of the south west of @entity42 will drift across the rest of the @entity18			1
high pressure meanwhile is expected to build on friday with some sunshine in most places and temperatures getting into double figures			0
by the weekend temperatures are generally expected to be between @entity121 and @entity136 , although it will still be wet , fairly windy and unsettled in parts			2
on sunday however , the weather is expected to be slightly more settled and much of the country is expected to see temperatures rise to the mid-teens			2
the south and east will see the best of the weather , with the possibility of temperatures in some spots , such as @entity149 , hitting @entity150 , along with drier and brighter conditions			2
mr @entity35 said : ' then things will settle back down to average for the start of the working week			0
' the weather is expected to remain unsettled over the next three days , with rain spreading across the @entity18 from the south west , but temperatures will hit highs of @entity7 by sunday today marked the end of the recent cold snap , and temperatures are expected to rise to as high as @entity7 in parts of the country by sunday a man mows the lawns at @entity167 in @entity168 - on - @entity169 , @entity170 there was even a chance for a spot of cricket at @entity175 , @entity176 , today blue skies can be seen in the @entity178			1
warmer weather is on its way from this weekend the @entity181 , which governs most weather in the northern hemisphere , has been positioned to the south of the @entity18 for the last month , leading to the bitter weather			2
but forecasters said that it will finally start to move north over the weekend , leading to more spring - like conditions			0
despite the weekend forecast , parts of @entity42 and @entity40 were still covered in snow yesterday as temperatures remained unseasonably low – between @entity192 ( @entity193 ) and @entity194 ( @entity195 ) – following one of the coldest marches on record			0
end of the cold snap ? a car drives through the thawing snow as temperatures remain around freezing in @entity203 , @entity204 , yesterday icy conditions : the temperatures remained low yesterday but are expected to have vastly improved by sunday			1
