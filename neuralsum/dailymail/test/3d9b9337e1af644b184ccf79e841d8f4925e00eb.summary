when keen runner @entity1 was training for a marathon when she was a size 18 , she was often heckled with taunts of ' @entity5 , fatty ! ' as she ran			1
even her doctor told her she was too big to contemplate running 26.2 miles and should give up on her goal			1
with stories like this , it is perhaps no surprise that a new survey has found two thirds of women believe they ca n't run - despite being desperate to be fitter and healthier			1
she completed a marathon in 2012 - and has done numerous other races since			1
now through her website , @entity28 's guide to running , she 's encouraging other women to take up the sport regardless of their size and ability			1
she appeared on today 's @entity34 with sub-three hour marathoner @entity35 to launch the @entity37 show 's @entity39 campaign			1
@entity1 said : ' two million more men than women in the @entity43 play sport because women are often too worried about what they look like and fear they will be judged by others , this has to stop			1
' @entity48 will show that anyone can find success with running , and show that women of all shapes and sizes that running can be fun and can be a great way of improving physical and mental health			1
and if enough women get involved and give it a go , we can really start tackling negative perceptions in our own communities			1
' i was told by a doctor i was too fat to run , and just three weeks later i proved him wrong by running the @entity65 , but you do n't have to be able to run far or even fast to benefit from the joys of running , its all about taking part and being inspired â€¦ even if you are still a little bit rubbish at it			1
' @entity1 , back right , appeared on today 's @entity34 with @entity35 , back left , to encourage women to take up running			1
front row from left : @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 are taking up the challenge marathon runner @entity35 encouraged the women to believe in themselves @entity35 , whose guide to running book was published by @entity81 this month , added : ' break down that barrier of being embarrassed and you will meet like - minded people in the running community			1
' there 's lots of support on @entity89 with groups such as @entity43 @entity91			2
' when you start running , your confidence will soon grow			2
i just used to go to local park and could only manage short distances but i gradually built it up			2
doing races is real confidence booster so believe in yourself as you can do it			2
' a @entity34 poll of 1000 women found that 60 per cent think they ca n't run yet 88 per cent would like to be fitter than they are			1
seventy per cent have n't been for a run in the last year but more than 75 per cent plan on getting fitter this year			1
many women are put off running because they fear they are not fit enough and are self - conscious about being seen sweating and panting while out on a jog			1
@entity1 loves running and has never let her size hold her back			1
she encourages other women to do the same others believe their size is holding them back so they do n't bother - even though by taking up the sport they could lose weight			1
the @entity34 project , like the recently launched ' this girl can ' @entity117 campaign , aims to show women they can run - even if they are currently unfit and overweight			1
the show will follow three novice runners - @entity122 , 38 , from @entity123 , @entity124 , 23 , from @entity125 , and @entity126 , 37 , from @entity127 , @entity128 - as they train for five weeks to run @entity129			1
the show is encouraging viewers to join them on the journey by taking up running themselves			1
the three women revealed they currently fall into the camp of not believing they can run but want to give it a go to improve their health and wellbeing			1
@entity141 hands out new trainers to the three woman sat on the sofa who believe they ca n't run but have agreed to try a five week programme culminating in a 5k race @entity74 said : ' i 've tried running up and down my close and i feel like i 'm going to have a heart attack			1
' @entity76 said she wants to become like the runners she sees out training enjoying the exercise and taking in the scenic countryside when they run off - road			1
@entity157 explained that her motivation is to partly aid weightloss , as well as to set a good example to her children			2
she said : ' i know i have always been fat but finding out i 'm now classed as clinically obese is scary			1
' i need to do this for my children , it 's not about dress size anymore it 's about health			1
society is more accepting of big woman now but for health that 's not good			0
' what i hope to get from this is a new me so i 'm not the fat mum at the school gates			2
' @entity1 knows how @entity157 feels as she weighed 20st when she first started running in 2003			1
now she is slimmer and fitter but she explains women have so much more to gain from taking up running than just weightloss			2
@entity35 looked the part as she arrived at the @entity37 studios in her running leggings and trainers she said : ' i 'm not a size 8 and if i can do it , so can you			1
woman who take up running will come to realise it 's fun and then they will want to do it more			0
we often hate running as it hurts but you can find ways to enjoy it			0
' you have to build up gradually stop letting excuses like having bad knees or a bad back or no sports bra stopping you getting out the door			0
get out and start walking then build up to running and you will see the health improvements			0
' @entity198 advised anyone who is concerned about taking up running to speak to their doctor first			0
to avoid injury , she also recommends wearing supportive trainers , starting slowly and stretching after running			0
one of the reasons many people avoid running is a fear that it 's bad for their knees			0
but a study of 75,000 runners , which was published in @entity213 in @entity214 last year , found that ' running significantly reduced osteoarthritis and hip replacement risk due to , in part , running 's association with lower @entity219 ( @entity219 ) '			2
@entity35 finishing the @entity220 1			1
invest in a good pair of trainers and some seam - free running socks			0
you are best going to a specialist shop for this as they will assess your running gait ( or style ) to find the appropriate pair			0
it 's the only big investment you have to make and it 's so important that your feet are comfortable			0
buy a good sports bra			0
aside from running shoes , this is the other essential for women			2
team up with a friend so that you can support and motivate each other			0
if you have arranged to meet someone you 'll be less likely to back out			0
running with someone else also helps the minutes tick by as you have a good gossip			0
alternatively look for a beginner 's group or couch to 5km scheme in your area ( @entity251 is a great place to start )			0
if you have n't run before , download a couch to 5km programme or app ( there are plenty available for free ) as they advocate lots of walking and running to start with			1
build up gradually , increasing your running duration by no more than 10 per cent every week			0
we women are all so busy and i find it helps to sit down at the start of the week and think about what i have on each day so that i can plan when to fit in a run			1
it 's amazing how it slots into your routine - i 've jogged to school to pick up my son with my daughter in the pushchair and then jogged back as he scoots or cycles along with us			0
make it work for you			0
psychologists have proven that keeping a record of your running achievements helps to spur you on			0
so write everything down in a diary and flick back through it when you need a boost			0
ok , this is not as daunting as it sounds , i recommend everyone tries a parkrun ( parkrun.org.uk ) after about 5 - 6 weeks of running regularly			0
these free 5km events are held weekly at around 300 parks in the @entity43			0
this does n't mean you are aiming to win @entity300 medals or set a record for your age group			2
but making targets for yourself can keep you going			0
it might be that you set a goal of running 5km after 6 weeks or finishing ahead of a certain person in training			0
it all helps hugely with motivation			0
one of the things i love about running regularly is that i can stay in shape without having to stick to a strict diet that forbids the eating of certain food groups			0
in my modelling days , the girls who were on no - carb , or no - fat diets always seemed so miserable			2
and sports scientists all agree that a moderate amount of carbs are essential for running			0
maybe it 's to lose weight , to raise money for charity or to de-stress			0
whatever the reason , do n't lose sight of it			2
that way when that little voice inside your head tries to stop you from heading out on a run to stay on the sofa with chocolate instead , you will overcome it			2
running will empower you in a million ways			0
run first and eat your chocolate afterwards ( chocolate milk is proven to be a great recovery drink )			2
this @entity34 's @entity39 campaign starts today at 10.30am on @entity37			2
