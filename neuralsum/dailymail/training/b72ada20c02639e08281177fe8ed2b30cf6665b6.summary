by @entity0 for @entity1 a nurse who was taunted for being fat when she reached nearly 15st aged 15 has beaten the bullies to become a beauty queen			1
@entity5 , now 19 , competed in her first national pageant on sunday after slimming down to 8st 9lb			1
her night on the runway marked an incredible transformation from the former size 22 schoolgirl who was teased and even attacked by fellow pupils over her weight			1

when friends began noticing @entity5 's slimmer figure last year she decided to compete in a local beauty pageant			2
she went on to become @entity28 and competed at @entity29 in @entity30 on sunday			1
@entity5 , pictured age 15 , used to eat twice most evenings and snacked extensively on biscuits and other treats @entity5 was often beaten up and even had objects thrown at her by cruel school bullies over her size @entity5 , who now weighs 8st 9lb , said : ' when i was younger i 'd go to see my grandparents and have tea with them before going back home and scoffing another portion of food			1
' i really loved biscuits too and i nearly always had a packet in my hand			0
my school years were absolutely horrific at times			2
' i weighed almost 15st at my heaviest and other kids would throw stuff at me , hit me and call me all sorts of names because of my size			2
originally too embarrassed to go to a gym @entity5 began exercising in her bedroom and the weight began to fall off ( left , overweight aged 14 , right , pictured now ) ' i got to a point where i thought enough was enough so i bought a stack of workout dvds and started training in my bedroom			1
' after a few months people started to notice i had lost weight and it gave me a real confidence boost			2
' i kept on going with the sit - ups , press - ups , running and everything else and i seriously got hooked on training			0
' i 'm so glad i did it and i 've never looked back since			0
' when friends began to notice the change in her appearance they suggested @entity5 entered a pageant the inspirational beauty queen , who is now a size eight , cleaned up her diet of junk food and started training for more than an hour every day in a bid to shed the pounds			1
her gruelling training regime soon paid dividends and before long she found herself competing at @entity28 @entity79			0
since making her beauty pageant debut , @entity5 has gone on to claim second prize at the face of the @entity84 beauty contest and cruised to victory in the @entity87 event			0
she said : ' the first time i went up on stage at the @entity28 @entity79 contest was incredible			0
@entity5 cleaned up her diet of junk food and started training for an hour every day in a bid to shed the pounds @entity5 was crowned @entity28 and competed at @entity29 on sunday ' i was so nervous as i 'd never done anything like that before but it gave me so much confidence that i was desperate to do it all over again			1
' being crowned @entity28 this years was an amazing feeling and i 'm hoping i can have some success at the national competition in @entity30			0
' it 's just incredible to look at pictures of myself when i was 15 and then look in the mirror at how i am now			0
' it took around two - and - a - half - years of really hard graft to get to where i am but it was well worth it			0
' i feel like a completely new person			0

used to *secretly* eat *dinner* at her grandparents before eating again at home
this and *constant* snacking led her weight to reach 15st by age 15
horribly bullied and even *physically* attacked over her size at school
too *ashamed* to go to the gym , she began exercising in her room
she also over *hauled* her diet and friends suggested she entered pageants
dropped from size 22 to size 8 and a trim 8st 9lb
crowned miss teen @entity136 and competed at @entity29
