breathing secondhand marijuana smoke could damage the heart and blood vessels as much as secondhand cigarette smoke			1
in a new study , blood vessel function in lab rats dropped 70 percent after just 30 minutes of exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke			1
even when the marijuana contained no @entity11 - the compound that causes the ' high ' - blood vessel function was still impaired			1
' most people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad , but many do n't realise that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful , ' the new study warns blood vessel function is important because a reduced level may raise the chances of developing hardened arteries			1
if function is low , plaque can build - up in the arteries which narrows them and restricts blood flow			0
this , in turn , can increase the risk of a heart attack			0
' most people know secondhand cigarette smoke is bad for you , but many do n't realise that secondhand marijuana smoke may also be harmful , ' said study author @entity35 , associate professor of medicine at the @entity36 , @entity38 's @entity37			2
marijuana and tobacco smoke are chemically and physically alike , aside from their active ingredients			1
the drop in blood vessel function from @entity11 - free marijuana suggests that the compound is n't responsible for the effect			1
similarly , this study confirms that nicotine is not required for smoke to interfere with blood vessel function			2
in the study , researchers used a modified cigarette smoking machine to expose rats to marijuana smoke			0
a high - resolution ultrasound machine measured how well the main leg artery functioned			0
researchers recorded blood vessel dilation before smoke exposure and 10 minutes and 40 minutes after smoke exposure			0
exposure to second - hand marijuana smoke hardened the arteries ( pictured ) over time , in turn increasing the risk of a heart attack they also conducted separate tests with @entity11 - free marijuana and plain air			1
there was no difference in blood vessel function when the rats were exposed to plain air			2
in previous tobacco studies , blood vessel function tended to go back to normal within 30 minutes of exposure			1
however , in the marijuana study , blood vessel function did n't return to normal when measured 40 minutes after exposure			1
now that marijuana is becoming increasingly legalised in the @entity87 , its effect on others is a growing public health concern , dr @entity35 said			0
' if you 're hanging out in a room where people are smoking a lot of marijuana , you may be harming your blood vessels , ' he said			0
' there 's no reason to think marijuana smoke is better than tobacco smoke			0
' secondhand tobacco smoke causes about 34,000 premature deaths from heart disease each year in the @entity87 among nonsmokers			2
more research is needed to determine if secondhand marijuana smoke has other similar effects to secondhand cigarette smoke in humans			0
the research was presented at the @entity110 's @entity109 2014 .			0

secondhand marijuana smoke could damage the heart and blood vessels
blood vessel function in lab rats dropped 70 *%* after 30 mins of exposure
this in turn made hardening of the arteries - and heart attack - more likely
marijuana and tobacco smoke are chemically and physically alike , aside from their active ingredients , the @entity87 researchers *explain*
