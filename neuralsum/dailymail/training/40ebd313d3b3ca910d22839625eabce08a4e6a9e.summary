who 's a naughty boy ? this mucky flamingo chick , pictured with his mother , was covered in mud after taking its first steps out of the nest but her anger did n't last as , before long , the chick snuggled up in his mother 's feathers and enjoyed a bite to eat			1
at just two weeks old , the flamingo chick had been taking his first steps out of the nest among the 80,000 strong colony of birds in @entity30 national reserve in @entity31			1
it spent half an hour slipping and sliding around in mud as he tried to scramble back to the nest before its mother noticed he was gone			2

@entity47 : the flamingo chick spent half - an - hour slipping and sliding around in the mud feeding time ! the chick ate a pureed dinner of plankton , shrimp and tiny fish from his mother 's bill mr @entity38 , 40 , said : ‘ this mum and baby caught my eye because they were a bit separated from the other flamingos			1
‘ we were able to sit right inside the colony as flamingos are n't afraid of people			0
‘ but we still had to arrive before sunrise and leave after sunset , sitting motionless in the mud so we did n't disturb them			0
‘ the mother left the nest to feed and refresh herself , before coming back to feed the youngster			2
‘ i could hear them chattering away the whole time they were together			0
‘ when the mother returned , the chick would stand up , open his beak and ask for food			2

‘ i was interested in the one - to one feeding process and seeing how the flamingos interacted			2

‘ their relationship made for a very tender picture showing how the big bird communicates with the small , weak chick			0
