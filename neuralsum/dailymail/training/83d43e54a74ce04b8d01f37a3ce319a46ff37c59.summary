by @entity0 published : 06:36 est , 9 november 2012 updated : 07:08 est , 9 november 2012 @entity1 has seen its fair share of violence in recent years - but the rape and murder of two young girls has provoked a fresh wave of shock and revulsion across the country			2
the children , aged four and five , were kidnapped , repeatedly sexually assaulted and then bludgeoned to death in two separate incidents near the southern city of @entity15			1
the brutal crimes have struck a nerve , even in a nation that has seen a horrific amount of bloodshed during the past decade			2
killer : @entity22 , has been convicted of raping and killing four - year - old @entity24 in the town of @entity26 , near @entity15 in @entity1 horror : four - year old @entity24 ( left ) and @entity27 , 5 ( right ) , were raped and murdered in separate incidents during a two - month period despite a conviction in one case , a handful of arrests in the other and beefed up police patrols in the city , families in @entity15 remain on edge following the murders of four - year - old @entity24 and five - year - old @entity27 during a two - month period			1
many parents in and around the city will not let their children go to school alone or even play outside because of fears for their safety			2
others are making plans to leave @entity15 altogether , saying they have lost confidence in the security forces ' ability to keep children safe			1
' these inhuman crimes make me think of the safety of my children , ' said @entity57 , 38 , a government employee and father of four			2
' i do not trust the security forces any more			1
i have to protect my family by myself			0
' to many in @entity1 , the murders mark a new , more menacing type of violence than the country has previously encountered â€” at least in public			0
crime : a member of @entity26 city council inspects a destroyed checkpoint building formerly belonging to the @entity1 army , where four - year old @entity24 was raped and murdered @entity15 , @entity1 's second - largest city , is considerably safer than @entity72 , and the recent attacks are seen as a particularly dark spot on an otherwise relatively quiet and stable province			1
the city of about 1 million and its surrounding province , which goes by the same name , is @entity1 's main oil industry hub			0
the region is generally poorer and shabbier than the capital , but it is slowly beginning to flourish as international companies move in , attracted by the region 's lucrative oil fields			0
@entity24 was kidnapped on august 16 in @entity26 , a rundown town just outside the city of @entity15			1
her family , from the nearby province of @entity88 , had come to town to visit relatives			0
police later found her body in a derelict area with her hands and legs bound			0
she was raped multiple times , and her head was smashed by what was believed to be a large brick , according to authorities			0
fearful : @entity57 escorts his daughters to school in @entity15 following the murders			2
many parents in the area are now worried for their children 's safety			2
( neither mr @entity57 or his family have any connection with the crimes ) an off - duty soldier assigned to a nearby army base , @entity22 , was arrested in connection with @entity24 's murder			1
he was found guilty on october 22 and sentenced to death for abusing and killing the girl , said judge @entity118 , the spokesman for the @entity119			0
@entity24 's family wants @entity22 to be executed publically at the scene of the crime as a deterrent , according to reports			1
the sentence has yet to be carried out			0
the other young girl , @entity126 , also came from @entity88 province , a relatively poor part of @entity1 that many residents travel from in search of work , often for weeks at a time			0
she was abducted on october 11 while her family attended a wedding not far from the scene of @entity24 's murder			1
her body was found 12 hours later bearing similar signs of trauma to the previous victim , though @entity126 was also strangled with a shoelace , officials said			0
industry : many @entity1 travel to the oil - rich @entity15 area from other parts of the country to work in the lucrative oil industry authorities later determined that the suspected kidnapper phoned nine friends and invited them to take part in the rape			1
so far , eight people have been arrested and have confessed to the crime			0
the case has yet to go to trial because the investigation is still under way			0
authorities believe the soldier convicted in @entity24 's killing is not connected to @entity126 's murder			1
' i can not rest or sleep while these criminals are still eating , drinking and sleeping in prison			0
they should be executed immediately , ' said @entity126 's father , @entity168 , a 30 - year - old construction worker and father of four other daughters			1
' @entity1 has become like a jungle where monsters maul the bodies of the poor people			0
' reports of the two cases have sent a wave of fear through the streets of @entity15			2
in an attempt to calm public opinion , security forces have started deploying more police patrols , particularly near schools			1
some officials blame a rise in drug use for the crimes , although many @entity15 residents see the focus on drugs as misplaced			2
they instead criticize @entity1 's government and security forces for failing to provide adequate security .			1
