an @entity1 - nominated film will still be released in the @entity2 today despite its disturbing similarities to the @entity5 air disaster - to the disgust of cinema - goers near to the home of one of the three @entity2 victims			1
@entity13 film @entity11 features a mass killer who locks himself in the cockpit of a passenger jet and crashes it in to the ground to murder everyone on board			1
in terrifying scenes the fictional passengers panic and one tries to smash his way through a door to get to the controls in chillingly similar circumstances to the ill - fated @entity29 @entity28 flight			2
the fictional killer invites his enemies on to the flight , including a lover who jilted him and a colleague who was hard on him at work , so he can kill them			2
despite protests the highly - acclaimed movie will be shown in @entity2 cinemas from today , however , it was released in @entity38 and @entity39 last year although it is not known if @entity40 had seen it			1
similarities : fans have raised questions over the release of @entity13 film @entity11 , which features a mass killer who crashes a plane , centre , into the ground @entity49 : one of the passengers tries to smash his way through the plane 's cockpit door after it was locked from the inside - just like what prosecutors believe @entity40 had done @entity49 : the passengers , which includes the killer 's former girlfriend and boss , panic as they realise the plane is going down on tuesday he locked the captain out of the @entity28 's cockpit before setting the airliner 's controls to descend into a rocky valley , obliterating the plane and killing all 150 on board			1
reports in @entity39 this morning suggest the locked - out pilot may have resorted to using an axe in a desperate bid to get through the armoured door as the plane hurtled towards the ground			1
prosecutors said the screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds			0
@entity40 was said to have been depressed for years , which he may have kept secret from his employers , and may have had a breakdown before crashing his plane from @entity87 to @entity88			2
movie fans say what happened with the @entity29 plane has terrifying similarities with the @entity11 movie , and have asked whether it should be pulled off the big screen			1
it is a set of six short stories , meant to be black comedies , but the first 15 - minute section where a pilot crashes a plane to kill everyone on board has taken on a new meaning			0
in it two passengers on board chat and discover they know a man named @entity110 - a woman who used to be his lover and a former colleague who was tough on him at work			0
release : the film 's distributor in @entity2 has said that it will not be delayed or banned despite the @entity5 disaster it then emerges that everyone on the flight is connected to him and the trapped passengers then try to break in to the cockpit as the plane hurtles downwards			1
@entity110 crashes the plane into his parents ' house , to kill them , himself and everyone on board			0
twitter users had noted the similarities between the film , and the horrific events of tuesday			0
@entity134 wrote : ' the similarities between the # @entity29 crash & the scene in @entity139 's movie , ' @entity11 ' is mind boggling ! ' @entity141 tweeted : ' an awful morbid coincidence ... the first story of the film ' @entity11 ' and the @entity29 aircraft crash			1
@entity146 wrote : ' i wonder if the @entity1 nominated ' @entity11 ' will be pulled from @entity2 cinemas given the sad unfolding events in the # @entity29 tragedy '			1
but it was cinema - goers in @entity153 - only half an hour away from @entity154 , where @entity155 , one of the three @entity2 victims , lived with his family - who were left disgusted with the decision to go ahead with the release			1
slipped through the net : @entity29 co-pilot @entity40 had suffered from depression and ‘ burnout ’ which had held up his career search : teams working in the difficult @entity5 terrain clear scattered crash debris and search for bodies and belongings receptionist @entity172 , 28 , from @entity153 , said : ' you would think there would be common sense and they could delay it for the sake of the families and people affected by the shock of such a tragic accident			2
' but they probably care about making money from the release and people would have already booked to see it so that is much more important to people than bereaved family 's feelings			0
' her words were echoed by @entity192 , 33 , a cleaner from @entity194 , @entity195			0
' i heard about it and think it is disgusting if anyone goes to see it after the crash , ' he told @entity202			0
' the fact that it mirrors it so closely means they surely should have waited just a little bit before releasing it here because even though it is n't on purpose , it is going to get criticised for not being sensitive at all			0
' retired teacher @entity209 , 67 , from @entity153 , added : ' to release it in the @entity2 so close to the incident when a few people from this country died is very insensitive			2
' surely they could have delayed it for a few days or even weeks and then no - one would have noticed ? ' but student @entity216 , 23 , who is originally from @entity217 , was more cynical			0
' maybe they have n't changed the release date because the publicity helps , they say there is no such thing as bad press , ' he said			0
' but i do think it is very distasteful , especially to the families involved , it is n't something you want to be seeing advertised at such a horrible time personally			0
' but distributor @entity232 told @entity202 it will still be shown in a number of cinemas across @entity2 from today			1
it is already out in the @entity236 .			2
