scientists have long warned of the dangers of eating foods high on the glycaemic index amid fears they increase a person 's risk of heart disease and diabetes			1
but a new study has revealed evidence to the contrary - debunking the @entity13 diet for those who are healthy			2
the glycaemic index is a measure of how quickly foods containing carbohydrates , such as fruits , cereals and baked goods , raise glucose levels in the bloodstream			1
those that cause a sharp spike in blood sugar levels over a two - hour period are said to have a high glycaemic index			1
while those that do n't cause the big rise have a low glycaemic index			2
conventional wisdom says that high glycaemic index foods like bananas and pasta are ' bad ' for heart health and may increase the risk of developing diabetes			1
a new study by researchers at @entity44 and @entity45 has found little evidence that foods high on the glycaemic index are ' bad ' for your heart health and increase a person 's risk of diabetes			1
the @entity13 measures how quickly carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels but the new study , carried out by scientists at the @entity59 of @entity60 and @entity44 in @entity61 , claims to have found little evidence to support these claims			1
professor of medicine at @entity60 , @entity66 , said the results ' surprised ' the team			0
' we did not detect any clear benefits of the low glycaemic index diets on the major risk factors for heart disease , and we found no evidence of benefit for diabetes prevention , ' he said			1
he added : ' the evidence has been inconsistent that low glycaemic foods help people lose more weight or keep it off			2
' in looking at the causes of obesity and ways to control it , a narrow focus on the glycaemic index seems to be unwarranted			2
' several popular diets encourage choosing low @entity13 carbohydrates , which has led to calls to put the glycaemic index value of foods on packaging			1
but the researchers warn only laboratory tests can establish a food 's gi rating , and the results can be unexpected , for example apples score low but cantaloupe melons score high			0
the scientists ' aim was to determine if foods ' glycaemic index influences a person 's heart health and risk of diabetes			1
professor @entity66 and study co-director professor of medicine at @entity44 , @entity111 , recruited 163 volunteers from @entity113 and @entity61 , all of whom were overweight and had above normal blood pressure			2
they randomly assigned them to follow one of four diets			0
low @entity13 foods new potatoes spaghetti brown rice sweet potatoes instant noodles wholewheat bread hummus sponge cake lentils @entity131 peas frozen green peas tomatoes @entity134 apples medium @entity13 foods @entity137 white pita bread wholemeal rye honey digestives blueberry muffin ice cream @entity144 bananas @entity146 basmati rice cous cous gnocchi baked potatoes high @entity13 foods instant white rice @entity154 fries mashed potato tapioca short grain white rice white bread bagel @entity154 baguette scones rice cakes parsnips pumpkin watermelon dates each diet contained the same number of calories , but those calories came from foods that were either high or low in carbohydrates , and high or low on the @entity13 scale			1
the volunteers ate their main meal with researchers , and took home their next two meals			0
after five weeks on their assigned diets , they were switched to a different one			0
' a higher glycaemic diet would have more bananas and instant oatmeal , ' said professor @entity111			0
' a lower glycaemic index would have more dried apricots and steel cut oats			2
' the scientists tested the volunteers ' blood pressure , sensitivity to insulin , and levels of ' good ' high density lipoprotein ( @entity192 ) cholesterol , ' bad ' low - density lipoprotein ( @entity195 ) cholesterol and triglycerides - fat molecules in the blood stream that play a role in heart health			1
the results revealed the low @entity13 diets did not lower blood pressure or ldl cholesterol , and did not improve insulin resistance			2
they showed little difference between high and low glycaemic index foods , the authors said			1
professor @entity111 said it is likely people 's bodies can handle variations in food on the gi index , even if they are overweight and are already having problems with insulin resistance			0
he said : ' i guess it just works normally in most people , ' adding the glycaemic index should be studied among people with type 2 diabetes , which is also commonly known as adult - onset diabetes			1
women made up 51 per cent of the study 's volunteers , and african - americans made up 52 per cent , so the results have broad relevance , professor @entity66 said			0
he advised : ' get back to the basics that most people already know			0
' do n't drink sugar - sweetened drinks			0
try to eat fruits , vegetables and whole grains			0
try to avoid sweets , salt and foods high in saturated and trans fats			0
' people who follow these principles will reap the benefits			0
' the scientists ' aim was to determine if foods ' glycaemic index influences a person 's heart health and risk of diabetes			1
apples are said to be low gi while bananas are higher on the index professor @entity111 said existing studies suggest there may be a benefit for people with diabetes , but there needs to be more research			2
dr @entity263 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study , said the study 's message is that the glycaemic index is not that important if a diet is already heart healthy			1
' if you 're eating a heart - healthy diet , glycaemic index is not important to consider , ' said dr @entity263 , a past president of the @entity275 and a professor at the @entity277			1
'' i think the emphasis needs to be on the overall diet pattern , ' he said			0
professor @entity111 said people who want a good overall diet should look toward @entity284 - style diets or the @entity286 ( @entity286 ) diet , which emphasizes vegetables , fruits , fat - free dairy , whole grains , fish , poultry , nuts and vegetable oils			0
the study was published in the @entity296 .			0

glycaemic index is a measure of how quickly foods containing carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels in the bloodstream
high @entity13 foods like bananas and pasta are thought to be ' bad ' for the heart and may increase the risk of suffering diabetes
but new study found little evidence to support these claims
