republicans in the @entity1 are falling over each other in the race to file legislation that would stop president @entity5 from implementing his far - reaching immigration plan			1
no fewer than five separate @entity9 - sponsored bills are already pending in the @entity1 just 24 hours after the 114th @entity7 launched on tuesday			1
they all seek to do largely the same thing : prohibit the @entity12 from spending a single dime in 2015 on any part of @entity5 's plan , which he announced in december			1
the president 's aim is to mainstream 5 million or more people living in the @entity19 illegally , giving them residency and work permits and guaranteeing them that they wo n't be deported back to their home countries			1
@entity29 of @entity30 and @entity31 of @entity32 ( right ) introduced competing proposals to forbid the @entity5 administration from spending any money to implement what they have labeled an ' amnesty ' for 5 million or more illegal immigrants gearing up : president @entity5 , shown in the @entity40 on wednesday with vice president @entity41 , secretary of state @entity42 and national security adviser @entity43 , expects a showdown with the @entity9 over his immigration plans republicans , particularly those regarded as ultra-conservative , labeled the scheme an ' amnesty ' for lawbreakers and have vowed to block it			1
@entity53 and @entity54 have two competing bills			0
@entity30 rep @entity29 , @entity32 rep. @entity31 and @entity58 rep. @entity57 have measures of their own pending			0
a confrontation with the @entity62 is expected soon			2
' the president ’s executive actions with regard to immigration are outside of the @entity68 and outside of his powers , ' house speaker @entity63 told reporters during a press briefing on wednesday			2
' we can deal with that issue in the @entity12 bill without jeopardizing the security of our country			2
' republicans still have to deal with @entity12 funding because they separated it from the federal budget in december as a condition of funding the rest of the government through the sept. 30 end of the fiscal year			1
@entity19 's immigration enforcement agencies are part of @entity12			1
conservatives had pledged to scuttle the larger budget last month unless they were guaranteed another chance in february to hold the money over @entity5 's head			1
they hope the leverage will force the president to back off from his strategy to give safe harbor to millions of illegal immigrants			1
the battle will be joined in a matter of days			0
@entity102 chairman @entity101 of @entity103 told @entity104 on wednesday that ' the hope is that we could file a bill friday , in time for it to come to the floor tuesday or so next week			2
' which bill that will be is anyone 's guess			0
' we 're in the process of determining the best option on this right now , ' @entity63 spokesman @entity112 told @entity116 on wednesday			0
@entity118 's spokesman believes her version could easily be incorporated into the looming @entity12 budget bill			1
it would prohibit the expenditure of any money to put @entity5 's policy changes into action			2
' it 's very straightforward , ' @entity118 told the @entity127 on tuesday			0
' it lays out specifically that no funds will be used for these things			0
' she added that @entity9 knew what they were doing when they teed up a @entity12 showdown			2
' we did that so that we could have this fight on the president 's [ immigration ] overreach , ' she said			2
' i think that this prohibition language is the best way to do that			0
' rep. @entity31 's bill has the most momentum , however , with 21 co-sponsors signed on in just one day			0
( @entity118 's has none			0
) the @entity147 is expected to take up the measure , nicknamed ' @entity149 , ' in the coming days			0
which ? : house speaker @entity63 will ultimately have to choose one of several legislative ' defund ' proposals before the @entity12 budget expires on feb. 28 it strips funding from effors ' to grant parole or deferred action to any alien other than for reasons permitted under current law ' and ' to provide work permits or green cards to aliens who are currently unlawfully in the @entity19 , ' according to a press release			1
' in his latest effort to completely rewrite our laws , the president has decided to grant amnesty and work permits to millions of foreign nationals , ' @entity31 said			0
' what this legislation would do , [ it ] would allow @entity7 to exercise its intended role , and " check " the out - of - control @entity62 that has decided to simply pick and choose parts of the @entity68 that they like			1
' @entity178 rep. @entity177 , the bill 's leading co-sponsor , called @entity5 's immigration plan an ' end - run around @entity7			1
' ' by cutting off funding for the president ’s lawless overreach , ' she said , ' we can send a clear message that – despite his illusions – the president can not simply make up his own laws			2
' rep. @entity54 's bill would go further than the others , both telling @entity12 what it ca n't do and what it must do			1
in addition to defunding the @entity62 's unilateral plan , it would restore the @entity200 immigration enforcement plan – a system that @entity5 killed in november			1
under @entity200 , local law enforcement agencies shared fingerprints and other information on arrestees with federal immigration authorities , giving them a chance to start federal cases , often including deportation proceedings , against illegal immigrants			1
cities and counties , predominantly those dominated by @entity215 politicians , revolted against the plan			0
several declared themselves ' sanctuaries ' and refused to honor so - called ' detainers ' from @entity220 – orders to keep people locked up on immigration grounds past the time they would otherwise be released			0
@entity54 's bill would also force state and local governments to begin complying			0
dueling @entity228 : @entity9 reps			0
@entity53 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) have separate measures pending in the @entity1 to push back against president @entity5 's planned immigration law changes it ' not only defunds the president ’s actions towards amnesty but also removes the president ’s discretion in the ability to grant work permits , @entity241 , and other federal benefits that go along with his order , ' the @entity236 lawmaker said in a statement			1
' my legislation will also put limits on the president ’s future ability to enact such wide - reaching actions that circumvent the @entity68 ’s separation of powers			2
it returns the legislative authority of our government back to the legislative branch			0
' ' i hope that mr. @entity5 understands that the @entity19 people spoke very loudly during the election in november , ' @entity54 jabbed , ' and want a new direction away from his liberal policies			0
' rep. @entity29 's bill is the weakest of the five , limiting its impact to @entity12 funds that @entity7 has appropriated for the agency			1
the @entity62 has said it can implement the president 's immigration executive actions without new funds , however , relying on fees charged to people who apply for green cards and work permits			1
@entity276 's bill is the least likely to get a hearing : he was among the 25 conservative @entity9 lawmakers who revolted against @entity1 speaker @entity63 on tuesday , refusing to vote for his re-election to @entity1 leadership			0
the speaker 's office has already begun retaliating against the cabal of right - wingers , dropping two of them from the influential @entity288 , which @entity63 controls .			0

legislation aims to forbid the @entity12 from spending money to implement the @entity62 's immigration executive orders
there could be a floor vote on at least one of the bills as soon as next week
@entity7 put @entity12 on a short leash in december , leaving it out of the federal budget and *approving* its funding only through february
the president would almost certainly veto any law that ties his hands as he aims to guarantee 5 million illegal immigrants that they wo n't be deported
