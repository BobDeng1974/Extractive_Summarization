the @entity0 today christened the @entity1 , costliest and most deadly aircraft carrier ever built			1
the $ 13billion warship is the first in the @entity0 's newest generation of aircraft carriers			1
it was launched in a grand ceremony saturday from the @entity8 , va. , naval yard			0
the @entity11 is expected to stay commissioned for five decades and will enter the fleet in 2016			0
' she is truly a technological marvel , ' chief of naval operations adm. @entity26 said at the ceremony ' she will carry unmanned aircraft , joint strike fighters , and she will deploy lasers			0
' the staggering number of airstrikes , about one every six minutes , is capable because the ship 's deck uses electromagnetic force to propel the jets forward , according to @entity39			2
pressurized steam is used in older ships			0
electromagnetic force is used to propel roller coasters , the station noted			0
the gear used to snag jets as they land will be software controlled , a significant bump from the systems currently used			0
pomp and circumstance : it 's not everyday the most expensive aircraft carrier ever built is launched all hands on deck : an honor guard of boy scouts from the local area and @entity60 welcome visitors for the christening of the @entity1 soon to be set free : the $ 13billion ship will soon set sail president @entity11 's daughter @entity64 spoke shortly before smashing a champagne bottle on the ship 's bow			1
' @entity69 , their message fills this shipyard , ' she said			0
' you kept your promise			0
you gave the @entity77 people a president that was a shining beacon of integrity at the helm			0
' ' and as demonstrated by @entity82 and by the crew and by this mighty carrier , the @entity77 people are forever grateful to you			2
and @entity69 , i 'll always be proud , ' she added			0
other speakers honoring mr @entity11 included former vice president @entity88 and former secretary of defense @entity89			0
the @entity11 - with a new nuclear power plant , electromagnetic catapults and an enhanced 5 - acre flight deck - will leave dry dock and head to a pier at @entity96 next week			0
the @entity0 says construction on the ship is about 70 percent complete and will finish up in 2015			1
it will then undergo a series of sea trials before it is commissioned and becomes operational			0
the @entity0 also plans to buy another three such carriers , at a cost of $ 43 billion , to complete its fleet			1
but the project to build the most advanced aircraft carrier every made has come at a high price , with costs overrunning to the tune of nearly $ 3billion and major delays			1
@entity110 , spokesman for @entity111 , the maker of the ship , told @entity113 : ' the structure has been rearranged to accommodate new technology and meet all of the @entity0 ’s operational requirements			1
from head to toe : the @entity1 is decked out in patriotic colors big day : a massive crowd is on - hand to help dedicate the equally gigantic ship finishing touches : workers tend to a few last minute details before the ceremony begins the $ 13billion @entity1 will be one of the most fearsome weapons in the @entity128 's arsenal superpower : the new generation of aircraft carriers incorporates a host of top secret technology which is designed to secure dominance of any battlefield deadly : @entity1 will hold 4,000 sailors and marines and is designed to be virtually invisible to enemy radar the ship ’s structure and exterior are now 100 per cent complete , @entity139 said			1
but internal connections and features inside the ship are still being added			2
the ship began construction in @entity8 , @entity148 , in 2007 , but is unlikely to enter sea trials until 2016			2
the carrier would be fully capable by february 2019 , according to a critical watchdog report			2
delays ranging from between two and a half and four and a half years in testing three of the ship ’s most important new advances : its dual band radar , arresting gear and the @entity159 that will catapult jets off the carrier have become serious issues			1
power : the @entity1 is the new generation of aircraft carriers capable of launching 220 airstrikes a day rising costs : the @entity1 is expected to cost taxpayers more than £ 13billion when it is finally completed new generation : the giant 1,106 - foot ship is currently under construction at a dry dock in @entity8 , @entity148 , but will not be commissioned until 2016 and the spiralling costs come at a time when the @entity0 is seaching for ways to plug a $ 14 billion cut in the upcoming fiscal year as a result of the automatic federal budget cuts known as sequestration			1
the state - of - the - art carrier has provoked strong criticism from some quarters , including the government 's own watchdogs			2
in a report earlier this month the @entity186 wrote : ' key ship systems face reliability shortfalls that the @entity0 does not expect to resolve until many years after [ @entity11 ] commissioning , which will limit the ship ’s mission effectiveness during initial deployments and likely increase costs to the government			1
' it added : ' the @entity0 faces technical , design , and construction challenges to completing @entity11 that have led to significant cost increases			1
' national security experts at the @entity200 , the @entity201 , have also called into question the value of the aircraft in future conflicts			0
' i ’m not persuaded they ’re worth twice what the old carriers cost , ' @entity206 , of @entity201 , told @entity113			1
christening : relatives of former @entity77 president @entity11 salute a model of a new aircraft carrier named the @entity1 during a naming ceremony at the @entity128 in 2007 state - of - the - art : this graphic illustrates the cutting edge technology in the @entity11 aircraft carrier			2

@entity1 will cost $ 13billion when finished
carrier will be *equipped* to launch 220 airstrikes per day
ship holds 4,000 sailors and marines and is virtually invisible to enemy radar
project faces criticism after becoming beset by delays and cost overruns
@entity0 plans to buy another three carriers , at a cost of $ 43 billion
