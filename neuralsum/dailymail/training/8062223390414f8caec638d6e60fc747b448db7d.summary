the ability to love and empathise are among humanity ’s defining characteristics			2
but while understanding another person 's plight can inspire gentle emotions , under certain circumstances , feelings of tenderness and sympathy can in fact lead to aggressive behaviour , researchers claim			1
experts believe the phenomenon exists because certain hormones produced by nerve cells interact that lead to aggression to help those in need , which may explain why humans are prepared to harm others to protect their loved ones			1
showing compassion ( illustrated by a stock image ) and understanding another person 's plight can inspire gentle emotions , but under certain circumstances , feelings of tenderness and sympathy can predict aggressive behaviours , researchers claim ‘ it 's not about anger or feeling personally threatened , ’ said @entity29 , associate professor at @entity30 , the state university of @entity32			1
he believes that two neurohormones appear to be among the mechanisms contributing to the counterintuitive response			0
neurohormones are chemicals produced by nerve cells that act as both hormones in the blood stream and neurotransmitters in the brain			0
‘ both oxytocin and vasopressin seem to serve a function leading to increased ' approach behaviours , he said , explaining that people are motivated by getting closer to others			0
people approach one another for many reasons , including aggression			1
certain hormones produced by nerve cells interact to predict aggression ( illustrated with a stock image ) on behalf of those in need , according to a new study			1
‘ it 's not about anger or feeling personally threatened , ’ but acting out of love or compassion , its lead researcher explained a study in 2012 found that less religious people , atheists and agnostics are more driven by compassion to be generous than people who define themselves as strongly religious			1
@entity72 researchers held three experiments into compassion and concluded non-religious people would decide how to act based on emotion , rather than doctrine			1
in the first experiment , researchers analysed data from a 2004 national survey of more than 1,300 @entity83 adults , using statements such as ‘ when i see someone being taken advantage of , i feel kind of protective towards them ’ , to see if there was a connection between religion and compassion			1
results showed those who agreed with the statements were also more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness , such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train			0
when they looked into how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in ways like giving money or food to a homeless person , non-believers and those who rated low in religious belief had better results than religious people			2
the authors said : ' these findings indicate that although compassion is associated with pro-sociality among both less religious and more religious individuals , this relationship is particularly robust for less religious individuals			0
' so it stands to reason that if compassion is linked to the action of these hormones , then they are linked to social approach behaviours that they might help account for the link between compassion and aggression , professor @entity29 explained			1
he and his team conducted a two - part study consisting of a survey and an experiment			0
‘ the results of both indicate that the feelings we broadly call empathic concern , or compassion , can predict aggression on behalf of those in need , ’ he said			1
the survey asked people to report on someone close to them and explain how that person was threatened by a third - party			2
then , participants described their emotions and reaction to the situation			0
while previous studies have looked at aggression on behalf of others , professor @entity29 said : ‘ the idea that empathy can drive aggression absent of provocation or injustice is quite novel ’			2
in the experiment , participants provided a saliva sample in order to measure their neurohormone levels			0
they then heard a compassion - evoking story about a stranger who was supposedly set to take part in a study measuring the effects of physical pain by eating hot sauce			0
the ‘ real ’ participant under observation for this study had a choice of how much pain would be dished out to a third party , who was competing with the person they felt sorry for in the study			0
‘ the results of both the survey and the experiment indicate that the feelings we have when other people are in need , what we broadly call empathic concern or compassion , can predict aggression on behalf of those in need , ’ professor @entity29 said			1
the study appears to shed light on soldiers who think more about protecting a comrade than fighting against a broader threat , or parents who are prepared to sabotage a child ’s competition attempt so their own child can win , according to the scienstists ‘ in situations where we care about someone very much , as humans , we were motivated to benefit them , but if there is someone else in the way , we may do things to harm that third party			0
’ that reaction is not because the third party has done anything wrong , but because of love or compassion for those we care about , he explained			2

people become aggressive out of love for someone they feel close to
