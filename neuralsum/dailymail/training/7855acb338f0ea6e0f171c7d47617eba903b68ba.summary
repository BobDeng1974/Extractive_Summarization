more airplane passengers than ever are trying to get through airport security while carrying firearms			1
luckily , the @entity3 has recently started an @entity5 feed to document such illicit carry - ons			1
the @entity3 set a record in may for the most guns seized in one week - 65 in all , 45 of them loaded and 15 with bullets in the chamber and ready to be fired			1
in june , the agency began adding photos to an @entity5 photo feed and , surprise , they are mostly of firearms			1
what gun ? in a year when more passengers than ever are being caught carrying guns onto planes , the @entity3 has started posting such confiscated items on an @entity5 feed in the first six months of this year , @entity3 screeners found 894 guns on passengers or in their carry - on bags , a 30 percent increase over the same period last year			1
several times every day , at airports across the country , passengers are trying to walk through security with loaded guns in their carry - on bags , purses or pockets , even in a boot			1
and , more than a decade after 9/11 raised consciousness about airline security , it 's happening a lot more often			0
last year @entity3 found 1,549 firearms on passengers attempting to go through screening , up 17 percent from the year before			1
oh , that gun : a record 65 guns were confiscated by @entity3 officials from passengers attempting to board planes			1
the most common excuse was ' i forgot it was there ' in response to a request from @entity56 , the agency provided figures on the number of firearm incidents in 2011 and 2012 for all @entity61 airports , as well as the number of passengers screened at each airport			1
the @entity56 analyzed the data , as well as weekly blog reports from the agency on intercepted guns from this year and last year			1
@entity3 did n't keep statistics on guns intercepted before 2011 , but officials have noticed an upward trend in recent years , said spokesman @entity73			1
some of the details make officials shake their heads			0
but in the @entity5 account , the agency has found away to show the public the extent of the problem while educating them as to what they can , and can not , bring aboard an aircraft			1
it was only opened in june , but @entity3 photos on the social image sharing site already includes several shots of pistols , a grenade , a stun gun disguised as a cigarette box , among other dangerous weapons			0
that 's not my grenade : the @entity5 feed , opened in june , shows other prohibited weapons , too , like these menacing blades and concussion grenade told you it was n't a gun : this urban camouflage contraction may look like a gun , but its actually an ingeniously disguised switchblade ‘ we do n't analyze the behavioral traits of people who carry weapons			1
we 're looking for terrorists , ’ @entity73 said			0
‘ but sometimes you have to scratch your head and say , ` why ? ' ‘ one screaming example of ‘ why ! ? ’ might be found in a @entity115 , @entity117 passenger who , last year , was sauntering through security when @entity3 officers noticed he was wearing a shoulder holster , and in it was a loaded 9 mm pistol			1
the same passenger was found to have three more loaded pistols , 192 rounds of ammunition , two magazines and three knives			0
you 're in taser country : this is a stun gun disguised as a pack of @entity132 cigarettes posted to the @entity5 feed			1
notice the extra ' l ' screeners elsewhere found a .45 - caliber pistol and magazine hidden inside a cassette deck			0
another .45 - caliber pistol loaded with seven rounds , including a round in the chamber , was hidden under the lining of a carry - on bag in @entity144 , @entity146 passenger in @entity147 , @entity148 , was carrying a pistol designed to look like a writing pen			0
at first the passenger said it was just a pen , but later acknowledged it was a gun , according to @entity3			0
a passenger in march at @entity155 in @entity156 had a loaded .38 - caliber pistol containing eight rounds strapped to his lower left leg			0
at @entity161 , a gun was found inside a passenger 's boot strapped to a prosthetic leg			0
@entity3 does n't believe these gun - toting passengers are terrorists , but the agency ca n't explain why so many passengers try to board planes with guns , either , @entity73 said			1
the most common excuse offered by passengers is ‘ i forgot it was there			2
’ many passengers found to have guns by screeners are arrested , but not all			1
it depends on the gun laws where the airport is located			2
if the state or jurisdiction where the airport is located has tolerant gun laws , @entity3 screeners will frequently hand the gun back to the passenger and recommend locking it in a car or finding some other safe place for it			2
the government does n't track what happens to the people who are arrested			0
is it plausible that some people are so used to carrying guns that they simply forget that they have them , even when they 're at an airport about to walk through a scanner ? or do some people try to bring their guns with them when they fly because they think they wo n't get caught ? lone star state of mind : five of the 12 airports with the most gun confiscations last year were in the state of @entity203 dropping trou ' : this blade was disguised as a belt buckle according to the official @entity3 @entity208 account @entity209 , a sociology professor at @entity210 and the author of several books on the nation 's gun culture , said some gun owners are so used to carrying concealed weapons that it 's no different to them than carrying keys or a wallet			1
the most common reason people say they carry guns is for protection , so it also makes sense that most of the guns intercepted by @entity3 are loaded , @entity209 said			2
many gun owners keep their weapons loaded so they 're ready if needed , he said			0
even so , @entity209 said he finds it hard to believe airline passengers forget they 're carrying guns			1
‘ my wife and i check on things like eye drops and @entity235 to see if we 're allowed to take them on a plane , so it 's a little difficult to imagine that you are n't checking the policies about your loaded firearm before you get to the airport , ’ he said			2
occasionally passengers stopped by @entity3 are people who are used to carrying guns because they work in law enforcement , security or the military , but that does n't appear to be the case most of the time			1
@entity252 , an expert on gun policy and gun rights , theorizes that for some , the ‘ i forgot ’ answer is an excuse , ‘ just like somebody who walks out of a store with an unpaid - for item in their pocket			0
the first thing that person will say is , ` i forgot			0
' do people forget sometimes ? sure they do			0
but are there also people who try to shoplift to get away with something ? sure there are , and i think that 's no less true with guns			2
’ eighty - five percent of the guns intercepted last year were loaded			1
the most common type of gun was a .38 - caliber pistol			0
airports in the @entity275 and the @entity276 , where the @entity61 gun culture is strongest , had the greatest number of guns intercepted , according to @entity3 data			2
sneaky : items like this credit card knife are common finds in airport security lines of the 12 airports with the most guns last year , five are in @entity203 : @entity290 - @entity289 , 80 guns ; @entity292 in @entity293 , 52 ; @entity294 , 37 ; @entity295 in @entity293 , 35 , and @entity296 , 33			1
@entity297 in @entity297 had the most for any airport , at 96			2
others include @entity300 , 54 ; @entity301 in @entity302 , 42 ; @entity303 , 39 ; @entity305 - @entity304 , 37 ; @entity306 in @entity302 , 36 , and @entity307 in @entity302 , 33			0
by contrast , at @entity309 in @entity310 , where @entity3 screened nearly 27 million passengers last year , there was a single passenger found to have a gun			1
‘ there are some @entity61 who believe that there are no limits , that they not only have a constitutional but a @entity320 - given right to have a gun and ` by gosh , if i want to bring a gun on a plane i 'm going to do it , ' ‘ said @entity252 , a professor at the @entity322			0
too common : @entity3 officials say people try to get through security with guns , like the one in this handout , everyday and its occurring more and more often			2
in the first 6 months of 2013 , 894 guns were confiscated @entity3 's count of guns intercepted does n't include all the other kinds of prohibited ‘ guns ’ that @entity3 screeners find			1
last december , screeners stopped a passenger in @entity341 with seven stun guns in his bag			2
he said they were @entity345 presents			0
the same week , screeners spotted 26 stun guns in the carry - on bag of a passenger at @entity309			1
@entity3 has found several stun guns disguised as smartphones , and one that looked like a package of cigarettes			2
passengers are allowed to take guns with them when they fly , but only as checked baggage			1
they are required to fill out a form declaring the weapons and to carry them in a hard - sided bag with a lock			0
festive : fireworks , a no - no on passenger planes , are also commonly found			2
why one passenger also happened to have brass knuckles ( bottom right ) remains a mystery most of those who are stopped with guns are reluctant to talk about it afterward			2
one who did n't mind was @entity375 , 53 , of @entity376 , @entity377 , who was arrested at @entity379 in @entity380 in may after screeners spotted 10 hollow - point bullets in his carry - on bag			0
@entity375 , who is completely blind , also had a .38 caliber @entity385 revolver in his checked bag that he had failed to declare			0
he said in an interview with the @entity56 that he was unaware of the specifics of the rules for checking guns , or that hollow - point bullets are illegal in @entity380			0
@entity375 acknowledged that it seems ‘ counterintuitive ’ for a blind man to have a gun but said he keeps a loaded gun handy for protection from intruders			0
in such a situation , he said , he would call out a warning that he had a gun and spray bullets in the direction of the noise if the intruder did n't leave			0
‘ i have five shots , and if @entity410 fan it out i 'm going to hit you , ’ said @entity375 , a @entity406 member who owns five guns .			0

a record 65 guns were seized from airport passengers in one week last may
1,549 firearms were confiscated last year from passengers attempting to board planes
now the administration has an @entity5 account to document the guns , and other *unusual* items , that passengers try to sneak onto *flights*
