many chaps would assert that map - reading is not really a female forte			1
now scientists have come up with a way for women to alter that perception			2
apparently , they should start playing video games			0
research suggests that using a games console for just half an hour a day makes brain regions associated with navigation grow , and regular game - players have a greater ability to build a mental map of their surroundings			1
bored ? do n't be : a study on women in @entity19 found playing games improved map - reading ( file photo ) previous studies suggested regular game - players had more grey matter in the area of the brain used for this purpose , but it was n't clear if there was a direct link			1
the study , at the @entity33 in @entity34 , used volunteers with no experience of gaming , most of whom were women			1
@entity38 were told to play @entity39 64 , a game with a strong navigation component , for 30 minutes a day for two months			1
the rest did not play any games			2
scans of the gamers ’ brains revealed new grey matter in areas associated with map - reading and memory , and tests of their navigation skills showed they were better at creating mental maps			1
writing in the journal @entity56 , lead researcher dr @entity54 said : ‘ i ’m fairly convinced that what we were training here was basic spatial orienting			0
‘ this study is the first to show changes in the brain ’s structure over the course of being trained to play a video game			2
’ the results echo previous findings in @entity71 taxi drivers , which showed a growth in the brain ’s memory hub the more time they spent on the job			0
uncertain : the women were playing @entity39 , but it is uncertain if the rules apply to all console games in order to qualify , drivers of black cabs must spend years creating a detailed mental map of @entity71 ’s streets to pass the knowledge			1
dr @entity54 added : ‘ we showed that the bigger the change in the hippocampus was , the more the volunteers navigated using this more male navigation strategy			0
' dr @entity54 hopes her work will ultimately yield new ways of helping to combat some of the memory loss and orientation problems experienced by people with dementia			0
she said : ‘ one of the first signs of dementia is that people tend to lose their sense of orientation			0
‘ video game playing could maybe prevent some of the decreases in structure and function seen in these degenerative diseases			0
’ dr @entity109 , a spatial cognition expert from @entity111 , described the research as interesting but warned : ‘ the big question is whether this actually translates into real - world improvements in map reading or in helping people with memory problems			2
’ it is also unclear whether all video games are equally beneficial – although some studies suggest that @entity121 and other logic puzzle games also boost the brain .			0

study *carried* out at @entity33 in @entity34
half of women tested were told to play @entity39 64 for two months
their map - reading skills were improved and they had more grey matter
