by @entity0 a former @entity2 steel worker has won a landmark court case against the mining giant which was ordered to pay their former employee more than $ 2.2 million in compensation after exposing him to asbestos dust			1
currently bed - bound and suffering from depression , @entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , was diagnosed with mesothelioma , after being exposed to the fatal substance while working at the blast furnaces at @entity15 from the age of 19 in december 1979 until 1981			1
' i can not begin to explain the devastation we felt on the day we were told he had this terminal illness , ' mr @entity8 's wife , @entity17 said			2
after a four year court battle , @entity2 was ordered to pay @entity8 ( pictured ) over $ 2.2 million dollars for negligently exposing him to asbestos dust ' we are trying to make the most of every day even though @entity8 is still very sick and unable to do most of the things he used to enjoy			1
' it is a daily struggle knowing that i will not have my loving husband to grow old with and that he will never meet his grandchildren and his life will be cut so short			0
we never expected this to happen			0
' the trial heard how the cancer and radiotherapy mr @entity8 received , changed him from a ' happy go lucky , try anything , take this piss out of you ' man , to someone plagued with night - sweats , lacking energy and motivation and suffering from a range of physical side - effects including , burns and vomiting			2
' when things remind him of the mesothelioma â€¦ they trigger uncontrollable shaking , ' the court papers state			0
' when mrs @entity57 asks him what 's going on in his head " he would say he wants to be here longer , to be with his family , but he is so scared that the meso is going to come back very soon and kill him , at such a young age "			0
' the 54 - year - old was diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma as a result of his exposure between the years 1979 - 1981 , when he worked at the company 's @entity15 after a brutal four year court battle in which @entity2 argued ' every available legal point ' , the company was ordered to pay the 54 - year - old $ 2,236,959.57 in damages			1
' mr @entity8 was only 50 when he was diagnosed with mesothelioma and he has not been able to work since then , ' @entity70 , a solicitor from @entity71 and @entity72 told @entity74			2
' he had intended to work until 70 - years - old , so part of the judgement includes his loss of earning capacity			0
' ' it 's a landmark decision in @entity10 because the damages awarded are the highest ever awarded in the @entity81 of @entity10 and the first time that @entity2 has been ordered by the tribunal to pay financial compensation to a former employee from @entity15 who was exposed to asbestos			1
' @entity2 is expected to appeal the decision which @entity71 and @entity72 solicitor , @entity70 , called a ' landmark ' win the trial revealed that @entity2 were aware of the large quantity of asbestos at the steelworks and understood the fatal consequences it presented to its workers - even in small amounts - and yet the material continued to be used right up until 1985			2
although @entity2 has shown signs that they will pursue an appeal - postponing the payment date for at least 28 days - ms @entity70 said that the case has set a precedent and is likely to instill confidence in other former employees who were also negligently exposed to asbestos while working at @entity15			1
' once the judgment came down , @entity2 's lawyers immediately requested a stay on paying the money and indicated they were considering an appeal , ' ms @entity70 said			0
' we do expect more people to come forward because the average latency period for exposure to asbestos and contracting the illness is 40 years , so if they were still using asbestos products into the mid 1980s then we expect more people to come forward with illnesses right up until the 2020s			0

@entity8 , 54 , is to be payed $ 2.2 million in damages by @entity2
he was negligently exposed to asbestos dust while working at @entity15 from the age of 19 between 1979 - 1981
mr @entity8 was diagnosed with terminal mesothelioma at 50 years of age
after a four year court battle , the result is considered a landmark win
@entity2 is expected to appeal the decision
