by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 13:04 est , 18 february 2013 @entity3 's next @entity2 smartphone is set for a major screen upgrade that would make it the most high - definition mobile on the market , if leaks are to be believed			1
the launch of the successor of the @entity10 could be just a month away , and rumours of a major upgrade in the specs of @entity3 's flagship phone are sweeping the internet			1
a document purportedly leaked by a @entity18 financial services firm claims the @entity19 will boast a 5in 1920x1080 display , quad - core processor and run @entity22 of @entity23			1
models brandish @entity3 's @entity10 in @entity25 : the launch of the successor of the @entity10 could be just a month away , and rumours of a major upgrade in the specs of @entity3 's flagship phone are sweeping the internet that document , details of which were revealed by a report in @entity32 , also claims that the phone will run the latest version of @entity35 and will be released as soon as march			1
other reports claim that the processor will in fact be an @entity41 - based @entity40 model equipped with no less than eight cores and running at @entity43			1
as far as cameras go , it is thought that the @entity19 will feature a rather standard @entity47 front - facing ccd and a high definition @entity49 - facing one capable of shooting hd video in 1080p at 30 frames per second			1
might it look like this ? it is more than a month since this picture which purported to show the next @entity57 phone emerged			1
commentators were quick to dismiss it as a fake as rumours emerged that @entity63 is developing an @entity64 to go with its @entity65 , it was almost inevitable that claims would surface that @entity3 is considering the same thing			1
reports suggest the @entity18 smartphone maker is considering a similar device as part of a secret initiative known as ' @entity73 '			2
the project is believed to include three devices , one of which is the @entity19 , another the @entity79 mini , and a third which might be wearable			0
a report in @entity81 purported to reveal the details , expanded on by @entity83 with speculation that it could be a watch or a fitness device like the @entity86			0
' some of the same arguments we ’ve made in favour of an @entity63 @entity91 hold , to an extent , true for @entity3 ’s potential " @entity93 " , ' wrote @entity83 reporter @entity94			0
the report included pictures of a concept device conceived of in 2009 by @entity98 in association with @entity100 which showed how such a device might look			0
mr @entity94 added : ' with estimates that the wearables market will surge by 2017 , @entity3 ’s involvement in the segment is probably unavoidable			0
' that health - tracking gadgets are expected to lead that surge , and that @entity3 already has its s health service up and running , only makes it all the more likely that fitness and activity monitoring will be its initial foothold			0
' a report in @entity113 claims that production will begin in march for an expected april release date - roughly a year since @entity3 released the @entity10 , its current state of the art phone			1
similar claims for the new device were repeated by mobile phone site @entity81 , which added that the phone would also feature a @entity123 - @entity122 ( eight - core ) graphics processing unit			1
it is more than a month since pictures which purported to show the next @entity57 phone last emerged			1
they showed a gadget with a new design which , like @entity132 's @entity131 phone , almost entirely dispensed with buttons			2
however the image , first published by @entity81 , was almost immediately dismissed as a fake by rival tech blogs			0
' it would be easy to enlarge the screen on a @entity10 press image using @entity140 , remove the home button and slightly reduce the size of the @entity3 logo at the top , ' said gadget site @entity145 at the time			2
' also , @entity3 generally has more tricks up its sleeve than simply copying the same design year - on - year			0
' the expected release of the @entity19 comes as @entity3 are locked in a global battle for smartphone supremacy with arch - rival @entity63 , maker of the @entity65			2
the @entity154 firm are said to have been preparing several new versions of its iconic smartphone this year , including a cheaper , plastic - bodied model aimed at customers in emerging markets			0
last week @entity63 ceo @entity160 appeared to suggest that a less expensive version of their covetable but pricey gadgets might be in the pipeline			0
' we are making moves to make things more affordable , ' he said at the @entity170 technology and internet conference in @entity171			0
the revelation came after mr @entity160 said that he saw a ' wide open field ' because @entity63 's @entity65 was currently ' only available to 50 per cent of [ mobile phone ] subscribers in the world '			2
the need for the company to diversify its offerings was underlined last month by a report which showed that the @entity65 is losing its appeal among well - heeled @entity183 customers .			0

@entity186 phone will feature 1920x1080 screen , rumours claim
it could be released as soon as march , but others speculate april launch
april launch date would mark 12 months since release of last @entity2 phone
