this bear picked a daring place for a slumber as she balanced precariously on a tiny branch - 50ft in the air			1
the brave four - year - old @entity7 bear climbed almost to the top of the huge tree just so she could doze and enjoy the stunning forest views that surround her			1
she cleverly distributed her weight by placing two paws on one thin branch underneath her and grabbed another in front of her			1
@entity30 , a 41 - year - old game designer from @entity31 , @entity22 , was lucky enough to see the bear sitting at the top of the tree			1
he said : ' when i first saw her , i could hardly believe the small branches could cover that much weight			1
' it looks like it 's barely enough ! but the bear was smart about it , ensuring she distributed weight across the thin branches			1
it was wonderful to see			2
' as an avid photographer - i never leave the house without my camera - it 's a rare gift to experience such a moment			2
' this was a day where everything simply aligned in a perfect way			0
' the emotion of the bear , the unlikely location , the afternoon nordic light , the weather , the depth of the image with the valley kilometres behind the bear , and the autumn colours of nature were all perfect			0
content : the bear relaxed for hours at the top of the tree , taking in the view and snoozing out of harm 's way : mr @entity30 , who photographed the bear , thinks the fact that a large male bear prowling the forest floor may have been an added incentive for her to climb the tree upping the ante : the bear was perched on a branch 50 feet up ' at the same time the trees looked so fragile , and they were , so it seemed like an impossible feat of bear bravery			1
' i was getting a sense of melancholy from her , sitting in that tall thin tree as the colours of autumn were all around her			1
but not being entirely free			0
' she was sitting there for hours on end			2
i never saw her go up , or down , just shifting the position around as she enjoyed the beautiful autumn day			0
' brown bears are expert climbers			0
they climb from a very young age , just for fun and to play , but also to gather food or to get a good lookout of the forest environment			2
' this one was there for the view , and to get away from the rest of the family in the park			2
' there was also a massive male brown bear on the ground , perhaps twice her size , and i reckon it was easier to simply hang out up there			0
expert climbers : bears learn to clamber around trees from an early age ' @entity124 in @entity22 is a little community around two hours drive outside @entity31			1
' they also have a bear park and carnivore research center where you get to see the bears in their natural environment			0
' i was there to photograph animals , and had been in the @entity133 valley for three days to capture nordic animals			0
' while we still have wild bears in @entity22 , they are extremely rare in the populated central parts of the country			1
' i knew this to be a place where i could get close to bears , while knowing they are in a park environment where they are respected , thrive and are studied			0
' the bears there keep on giving birth to new cubs , showing they are fond of the area			0

@entity151 photographed dozing 50 feet up a tree in a forest in @entity36 , @entity22
the creature expertly balanced her weight on the thin branches
she snoozed for hours and gazed at the view when she stirred
