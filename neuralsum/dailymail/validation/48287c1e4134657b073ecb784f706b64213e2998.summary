tech experts , analysts and customers alike have bemoaned @entity4 's watch for needing an @entity5 to have any real use			1
but the firm has since confirmed the device will ship with @entity9 of storage , and at least @entity11 of this will be free for music and photos			1
although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs , it does mean the timepiece can be used independently for certain tasks			1
although this is the equivalent to just 240 songs , it does mean the timepiece ( pictured ) can be used independently for certain tasks			1
the remaining storage will be used for apps and @entity30 the number of tracks it can store will also vary depending on the file sizes			1
@entity4 confirmed the storage rumours to fan site @entity36 but the company has not responded to @entity40 's request for more information			1
all three models of the watch will ship with @entity43 of total storage			1
this will be used to run the watch 's @entity30 software and apps			1
to put this into perspective , the entry - level @entity49 came with @entity43 of storage when it launched in 2013 and rival smartwatches typically only have @entity54 built - in			1
@entity4 will then let users store @entity11 of music and @entity57 of photos on the watch as well			1
this music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its @entity64			1
the photo limit equates to around 100 images			0
to put this into perspective , the entry - level @entity49 came with @entity43 of storage when it launched in 2013 , and rival smartwatches typically only have @entity71 built - in			1
users can additionally store 75mb images , or 100 photos			1
the music limit is the same as what the firm offers on its @entity64 ( pictured ) @entity4 's watch is available in three models : the watch , @entity81 and @entity80 ( shown ) and all models will be sold in 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions			1
@entity78 is made of stainless steel , @entity81 is made of @entity85 and the premium edition comes in 18 - @entity87 and @entity88 this music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them			1
the features of the @entity78 rely heavily on pairing it with an @entity5			0
to connect to a phone it either has to be within @entity104 range or connected to the same @entity105			0
it ca n't take photos because it does n't have a built - in camera but it can be used to view pictures in the @entity110			1
with a phone : 1			0
use the phone 's network to browse the web 2			0
make and receive calls 3			0
send and receive messages 4			0
use any installed app including @entity119 , @entity120 and more without a phone : 1			0
track steps using the built - in accelerometer 3			1
pay for goods using @entity126 4			0
dictate messages to be sent once the phone is connected 5			0
play up to @entity11 of songs although they will still need to wear @entity104 headphones			2
the low photo limit may be because @entity4 does n't want wearers to use the device for looking at pictures			2
the watch is meant to be a companion device and the photos will be more visible on the larger screen of an @entity5 and @entity140			2
it comes in three models : the @entity78 , @entity143 and @entity144 , and all models are sold in either 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions			2
it has been designed to be tethered to an @entity5 and the pair communicate over @entity104 and @entity105 which gives the watch added computing power			0
but this relationship means that as soon as the @entity5 is out of the equation , the watch has limited value			0
@entity152 also falls short of its rival ’s @entity155 that has an optional nano sim card slot			0
the @entity4 watch is made of stainless steel and prices range between $ 549 and $ 1048 for the 1.4 - inch model and $ 599 and $ 1099 for the larger 1.7 - inch version			1
@entity81 is made of @entity85 and ranges from $ 349 to $ 399			0
the premium edition has a similar build to the @entity78 but comes in 18 - @entity87 and @entity88			0
prices start at $ 10,000			0
in the @entity166 , the @entity81 starts at £ 299 , the standard watch starts at £ 479 and the edition model will cost from £ 8,000			0
this music feature will appeal to runners and cyclists in particular who will be able to use the health features of the watch ( example app pictured ) while exercising and listen to music without having to take their phone out with them			2
although they will still need to wear @entity104 headphones reviews of the @entity78 have mostly been positive but while some have said it ’s the best smartwatch on the market , the biggest criticism have been its lack of independent features - so this storage option will be a welcomed addition			2
@entity188 , technology expert at @entity189 told @entity40 : ‘ the @entity4 reveal finally answered all of our questions on pricing and availability , but the all - important " why " remained elusive			2
‘ @entity4 is asking us to pay for a level of technical craftsmanship and prestige - but this is unchartered territory and @entity4 is stepping into one of the few arenas where it ’s still outclassed			2
’ but @entity201 from @entity202 added : ‘ sales will be driven by the novelty factor as well as the draw of brand @entity4			2
plus it has an exceptional track record			0
‘ @entity4 made us buy into the tablet in our millions when sceptics questioned whether there ’d be enough demand			2
there ’s no reason it ca n’t do the same again			0

@entity4 has confirmed all models of its watch will ship with @entity9 of storage
and at least @entity11 of this will be available for storing music and photos
this is the equivalent to just 240 songs and 100 photos
but it does mean the watch can be used independently for certain tasks
the remaining storage will be used for apps and the @entity30 software
to put this into perspective , @entity4 's @entity49 launched with @entity9 in 2013
and @entity11 is the same storage the firm offers on its @entity64
rival smartwatches typically only have @entity54 of storage built - in
