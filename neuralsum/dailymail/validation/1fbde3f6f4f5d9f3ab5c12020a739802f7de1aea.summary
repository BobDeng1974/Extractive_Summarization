@entity0 has made just one change to his starting line - up for @entity3 on saturday , fit - again @entity4 returning in place of @entity6			1
injured on february 14 against @entity7 , @entity4 has timed his recovery from the three vertebrae fractured by @entity10 perfectly			0
it was anticipated that the problem , treated like a soft tissue injury , could come right in four weeks and the medics have been proved spot on , @entity4 taking part in full training all week to put himself in the frame to resume against @entity3			1
@entity20 head coach @entity0 ( above ) has made one change to the side that beat @entity23 @entity4 ( centre ) is back after being injured by @entity10 against @entity7 on february 14 @entity25 ( left ) has recovered from the hamstring problem that he had for @entity20 @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , @entity29 , @entity30 ( both @entity31 ) , @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , @entity38 ( @entity35 ) , @entity39 ( @entity28 ) , @entity40 ( @entity31 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 ( both @entity28 ) , @entity43 ( capt ) , @entity44 ( both @entity35 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 ( both @entity28 )			1

@entity6 will consider himself unlucky not to have held on , given his impressive show in helping subdue the vaunted @entity58 back row , but @entity4 has been true to his word after saying last friday that he was ‘ pretty confident ’ he would be declared fit for the @entity61			2
@entity6 instead takes a place on the bench at the expense of @entity65 who demonstrated his worth for the second time this spring , coming on as an early replacement against @entity23 for the concussed @entity70 and again not looking out of his depth			2
elsewhere , with @entity25 shaking off his hamstring problem , and @entity70 and @entity74 both coming through concussion protocols , @entity0 ’s team is as expected as they seek to set up a @entity77 trip to @entity78 on saturday week			0
@entity6 is expected to make way for the return of @entity4 against @entity3 on saturday @entity81 is set to keep his place in the @entity20 team for the @entity85 game against @entity3 it means @entity0 has continued to reward @entity81 for his consistently good form , keeping @entity88 , who started his first game for @entity28 in six months last saturday , on the bench for the third test in a row			1
there was concern about replacement out - half @entity51 ’s control of the closing 25 minutes against @entity23 , but he is again back - up to @entity25			0
@entity98 has been given the no 23 shirt once more , despite pressure from in - form @entity35 colleague @entity101 .			0
