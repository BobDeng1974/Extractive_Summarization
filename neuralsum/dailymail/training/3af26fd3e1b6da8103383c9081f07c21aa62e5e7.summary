these astonishing pictures provide an incredible glimpse at the lives of majestic elephant seals in the @entity4			1
wildlife photographer @entity5 captured the astonishing images at @entity7 on @entity8 , braving the powerful and ferocious creatures ' wrath to get the close - up shots			1
one of the photographs captures a massive elephant seal seemingly laughing at his fortune in the surf after managing to get a harem of 30 females - all to himself			1
you 're looking pleased with yourself : a male southern elephant seal appears to laugh after defending his harem of 30 females from other males looking for a mate a southern elephant seal appears to have smug look on its face as it protects one of the females in its harem on @entity7 , @entity8 in the @entity4 smug : a male southern elephant seal plays in the surf , content in the knowledge he has 30 females waiting once he hits dry land the battle - scarred giant even seems to smirk as he cosies up to one of his mates while still in sight of his now love - lorn rivals			1
mr @entity5 said : ' they 're always making some funny noise			1
so to have a laughing elephant seal makes sense - they really do make ridiculous noises			1
' @entity5 , from @entity50 , spent hours photographing the large male guarding his 30 - strong harem of females from rivals - including two smaller males working as a team to take him on			1
he said one would distract the bull in a vicious fight while the other would sneak in and mate with a female on the periphery of the harem , which can be 100 - strong			0
however , with some elephant seals reaching 15ft in length and weighing 10,000lb , fights are no laughing matter and ' always end in bloodshed '			0
community : amazingly , these giant elephant seals and penguins live side by side in @entity8 hugs : as penguins mill around in the background , a southern elephant seal wraps a protective arm around a female at @entity7 , @entity8 , in the @entity4 mr @entity5 , from @entity50 , said : ' when they rear up to bash each other , they lift about two - thirds of their body straight up making them stand almost 3m high			1
' they slam down onto each other with massive force and their weight , combined with very sturdy teeth , imparts damage nearly every time			0
' it 's not uncommon to walk around a beach and see scores of males with blood running down their face and chest			0
' the wildlife photographer was able to capture these close - ups because many of the males were too tired from fighting to charge him			2
oy ! elephant seal engage in a roaring match after one is bitten during a battle for females mirror image : two male southern elephant seals look like each other 's reflection as they square up to each other roar : the males ' clashes often end in serious injury			1
the photographer says blood - spattered seals are a common sight ' they slam down onto each other with massive force and their weight , combined with very sturdy teeth , imparts damage nearly every time ' , said mr @entity5 , who observed numerous vicious duels ' when they 're not fighting , you can pretty much stand within arm 's length of them , just sitting there watching them breathe , looking at their scars and being awed by their size , ' he said			1
' but when they get up and start to bellow , you know it 's time to step back			0
' there are two types of elephant seal , southern elephant seals and the smaller northern version			2
it is named after the males ' snout which resembles the trunk of an elephant			0
the big beasts can grow to be 16ft long and weigh over 6,000lbs , the smaller females are normally about 10ft long and weigh in at around 2,000lbs			0
they can hold their breath longer than any other cetacean animal , staying under water without air for up to two hours			0
elephant seals spend most of their lives at sea and only return to land to mate			0
they were almost hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries but since then the population is estimated to have recovered to about 700,000 members			0
hello cheeky : elephant seals faced extinction in the 20th century but numbers have since swelled the photographer was able to get close once the males stopped clashing , as seen here			2
the seal is roaring in pain as it is bitten spectacular : a pup surrounded by penguins on the coast , as snow - capped mountains loom in the background pain : a male ( left ) roars in pain after his opponent 's teeth clamp down on his neck			2
