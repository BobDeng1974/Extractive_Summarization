by @entity0 can you draw a map of the entire world from memory ? you ’ve probably seen it countless times - in travel guides , weather reports and at school - but recreating it on paper can be trickier that you think			0
that ’s what 30 students from @entity14 found out when they were asked to draw the world ’s continents without an atlas to guide them			1
most people missed the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , and a huge chunk of the @entity28 subcontinent			1
the black and white map , compiled by @entity31 user zaaakk , is a combination of 30 drawings done by students who were asked to draw the continents from memory			1
as well as layering the images on top of one another , zaaakk created a mockup that spliced his distorted map with geographic details captured from @entity46 satellites the size of @entity48 and the @entity49 shrunk dramatically , and there was only a tiny glimpse of @entity52 in some of the drawings			1
@entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 did n’t always make the cut either , and there was some debate as to how big @entity60 and @entity61 were in relation to each other			1
@entity64 and @entity65 , meanwhile , were often disconnected and incredibly swollen in size , taking up large parts of the ocean			0
@entity31 user zaaakk shared the results after digitally merging the drawings to see if they resembled anything close to the @entity73 as it is today			2

the size of @entity48 and the @entity49 shrunk dramatically in most drawings , and there was only a tiny glimpse of @entity52 in some of the images most people missed the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and parts of the @entity28 subcontinent			1

the map , posted on @entity31 , reveals just how little a large majority of people know about the geography of the @entity73			0
‘ to give an idea of the population sampled , i did this in the summer of 2012 at the @entity14 @entity107 campus , ’ said zaaakk			2
‘ most were 18 - 22 , and there was a roughly even split between male and female			0
i 'm pretty sure they were all @entity112 except one @entity114 guy			0
’ have a go yourself and see how you do			0
you might surprise yourself at how much - or just how little - you remember			0

@entity120 is a combination of 30 drawings created by students from @entity14
most people missed out @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24
@entity25 and chunks of the @entity28 subcontinent also did *n't* make the cut
