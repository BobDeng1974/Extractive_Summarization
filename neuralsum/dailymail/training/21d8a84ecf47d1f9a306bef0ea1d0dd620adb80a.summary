by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 21 april 2012 updated : 12:54 est , 21 april 2012 the lone survivor of a trio of men who were lost at sea has told how he desperately tried to flag down a passing cruise ship but watched , helplessly , as it sailed away			1
@entity8 , 18 , said he was enraged the @entity9 did not stop to save him and his two friends despite being spotted by passengers on board			1
@entity8 said he and his friends had gone fishing on the tiny boat on february 24 when the engine broke down			1
sighting : this photo was taken by birdwatcher @entity18 from aboard the @entity9 and claims to show the stricken fishing boat and red shirt used by the sailors to try to signal for help @entity18 was one of the passengers who spotted the tiny fishing boat while bird watching but his messages to the captain did not get through incredible strength : @entity29 , bottom left , receives medical attention on a commercial fishing boat after his life was saved by a sudden rainstorm out of mobile phone range , they had no choice but to survive on fish they had caught and hoped they would be spotted			1
since being rescued @entity8 has told how he used a piece of red cloth to try and flag the vessel down			2
@entity8 said he immediately shouted to his two friends @entity46 , 31 , and @entity47 , 16 , that he had spotted the ship			1
though very weak and near death , @entity46 also joined in by using a brightly coloured life jacket			0
the ship did n't stop , and the tiny fishing boat drifted for another two weeks before it was found			1
by then , @entity8 's two friends had died			1
' " i said , ' @entity54 will not forgive them , " ' he said , ' today , i still feel rage when i remember that			0
' the cruise ship , which is owned by @entity61 - the same corporation behind the operators of the @entity64 - which capsized earlier this year , apparently passed fishing boat @entity65 off the coast of @entity68 and despite passengers raising the alarm , did not detour to pick up the three fishermen			1
two birdwatchers on the deck of the luxury cruise ship spotted the stricken men with a long - range telescope and saw one of them waving a red cloth to attract their attention			2
' ignored sightings ' : three passengers on a deck of the @entity9 claim to have reported seeing frantic signals from those aboard the stranded fishing boat , but say the liner continued to sail on @entity18 and @entity87 , both from @entity89 , raised the alarm with a sales representative on the ship , showing him through the telescope what they could see			1
barred from going to the bridge themselves , they relied on him to pass on the message to the captain , which he assured them he had done			2
probe : captain @entity101 is said to have been at the helm of the ship when it is claimed to have been near the stranded fishing boat ' you do n't wave a shirt like that just to be friendly , said ms @entity87			1
' he was desperate to get our attention			0
' but when the ship continued on its course and nothing happened , the passengers began to worry			2
ms @entity87 went to her cabin and noted their coordinates from a tv feed from the ship , emailing the information to both the @entity121 @entity120 and her son			2
' we were kind of freaking out , thinking we do n't see anything else happening , ' she said			0
mr @entity18 could no longer bear to watch			2
' it was very disturbing , ' he said			0
' we asked other people , " what do you think we should do ? " their reaction was : " well , you 've done what you could do			0
" whether something else could have been done , that 's a bit frustrating to think about			0
' after @entity46 and @entity47 died , @entity8 was eventually picked up by a fishing boat off @entity136 's @entity135 , more than 600 miles from where they had set out			1
@entity8 said he slipped their bodies into the sea after they began to rot in the heat			1
before he was rescued , a rainstorm gave him fresh water to drink , helping him survive			0
throughout the ordeal , he thought about his eight brothers , and never gave up hope			0
safe at home , @entity8 said he recognized their boat from the photos mr @entity18 had taken with his 300 mm lens			1
' yes , that 's it			0
that is us , ' he said			0
' you can see there , the red sweater i 'm waving and , above it is the sheet that we put up to protect us from the sun. ' @entity8 mentioned the ship in his first statement to @entity68 authorities when he returned to his country			2
gradual recovery : the teenager poses with @entity136 sailors after coming close to perishing on the ocean and having to push his dead friends overboard back at home in @entity89 , @entity87 could n't sleep , wondering what happened to the men			1
doomed journey : @entity29 , left , pictured with an unidentified friend in @entity181 , @entity68 , went missing on february 24 after the motor on the group 's boat failed reading a news story about a @entity68 rescued off @entity136 after 28 days in an open boat , she figured that was the boat they had seen			1
she pestered @entity190 , the @entity191 , and even the @entity68 embassy			0
' we were all just sick about it , and just wanted to believe the ship notified someone , ' she said			0
meanwhile , the captain of the vessel , has said he is devastated that the message was not relayed to him			2
captain @entity101 is one of the company 's most experienced and said he would never knowingly turn his back on someone who was stranded			1
in a statement released by the company , it said : ' @entity190 deeply regrets that two @entity68 men perished at sea after their boat became disabled in early march			2
' since we became aware of this incident , we have been investigating circumstances surrounding the claim that @entity9 failed to come to the aid of the disabled boat , after a crew member was alerted by passengers			2
' the preliminary results of our investigation have shown that there appeared to be a breakdown in communication in relaying the passenger 's concern			0
neither captain @entity101 nor the officer of the watch were notified			1
' understandably , captain @entity101 is devastated that he is being accused of knowingly turning his back on people in distress			1
had the captain received this information , he would have had the opportunity to respond			0
' we all understand that it is our responsibility and also the law of the sea to provide assistance to any vessel in distress , and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea			0
' in fact , we have done so more than 30 times in the last ten years			0
we deeply regret this incident and are continuing our investigation to fully understand the circumstances			0
' saved by a rainstorm : @entity29 was found near the @entity135 , after floating more than 600 miles from his home in @entity68 disaster : this is the latest damage news story to engulf @entity254 since its liner the @entity256 struck rocks off the coast of @entity259 in january , this year , with the loss of 32 lives			0
