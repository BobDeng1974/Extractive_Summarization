the people of @entity2 's northwestern city of @entity3 have lived through countless bombings , shootings and kidnappings in recent years , but now a new peril stalks the streets - huge house rats			1
residents of the city , on the front line of @entity2 's battle against @entity13 militants , say the rodents have eaten countless chickens , bitten dozens of adults , spread disease and even killed a baby			1
but help is at hand in the stocky form of @entity24			0
' it is my mission and i took it on after i saw my friend taking his wife to hospital because she was bitten by a rat , ' mr @entity24 told @entity42 while on a mission in the city 's densely populated @entity45 neighbourhood			1
' her medical treatment cost him 5,000 rupees ( $ 50 , Â£ 30 ) and she had to have an anti-rabies injection			0
' the rats are nine to 12 inches long , almost the same again when you include the tail			1
' they are everywhere , in the streets , in markets and in shops			0
' mr @entity24 lays poison for the rats : residents of the @entity3 , on the front line of @entity2 's battle against @entity13 militants , say the rodents have eaten chickens , bitten adults , spread disease and even killed a baby scourge of the rodents : mr @entity24 is accompanied by his three daughters are he prepares his special poison mixture			1

he might be dedicated , and popular with residents , but so far mr @entity24 's efforts are strictly unofficial - and unpaid by the authorities the rat - hunter says they attack at night and escape before dawn , damaging the fabric of houses and shops , contaminating food and biting women and children			1
in past , the rat numbers in the city were limited but monsoon flash floods in the surrounding countryside in recent years have driven them downtown			1
many make their home in an open sewer which flows through the city and come out at night , gnawing with their large teeth and scurrying about in poor neighbourhoods			1
as night falls , mr @entity24 begins his hunt , tracking the rats on foot - street by street , house by house and shop by shop			2
he takes a piece of bread , sprinkles sugar on it and sprays it with a chemical mixture			0
' they are actually immune to local poison now , so i have to apply my own formula , ' mr @entity24 said			2
while @entity24 and his daughters lay the bait , further down the narrow grubby street , resident @entity123 patches up holes chewed by rats in the floor of his house			2
other than structural damage , mr @entity123 said rats killed his infant nephew			2
' they bit my nephew last year , he was one and a half years old , but we took him to hospital and he died there , ' he told @entity42			0
mr @entity123 's grandfather @entity138 said everyone has traps in their houses , but locals say mr @entity24 is the only effective resistance force			0
' they attack like an army and come around 10 c'clock at night , ' @entity144 , a tailor who makes leather jackets , told @entity42 , complaining the rats chewed through his stock			2
rats : dozens of the filthy rodents , flies crawling all over them , can be seen piled up ready for burial infection control : before disposing of the rats , mr @entity24 packs them into plastic carrier bags helping hand : a boy holds open a carrier bag while mr @entity24 shovels rats in using a hoe ashes to ashes , dust to dust : the dead rats are finally buried in a field on the outskirts of @entity3 mr @entity24 lays the poisoned bread in corners , in front of shops and all other places where the rats can sneak in			1
the morning after comes the clear - up , and mr @entity24 's formula seemed to do the trick			0
residents could be seen collecting dead rats with shovels and hoes and throwing them in a street corner			2
mr @entity24 gathered up to 100 , pitching the dead rats in his wheelbarrow using a hoe			0
he put them in plastic bags and buried them in a field			0
he might be dedicated , and popular with residents , but so far mr @entity24 's efforts are strictly unofficial - and unpaid by the authorities			0
' i have no resources and no help from government but its more than a mission for me , ' mr @entity24 said .			0
