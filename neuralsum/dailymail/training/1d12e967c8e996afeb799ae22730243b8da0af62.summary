slavery is not in the history book			0
it 's right next to you , ' she told @entity47			0
@entity4 was one of 11 children born to her parents in the slums south of @entity51			1
she says her home life was mostly happy , but her construction - worker father did beat the kids up			0
her childhood came to an end the day one of her older sisters was accused of stealing something from the home of her wealthy employers , a man named @entity63 and his wife @entity33 - @entity65			0
used and abused : during her time as a slave , @entity4 worked 20 hours a day and was only allowed one meal - the family 's leftovers from dinner @entity4 went with her mother to visit the wealthy couple 's house in @entity74 and listened as they demanded a younger replacement to make up for the stolen property			1
suprisingly , @entity4 's mother agreed			2
@entity4 cried as her mother left and the last thing she said was : ' this is for the good of the family '			2
freedom : @entity4 gained her freedom two years after the family moved to @entity16 and someone sent an anonymous tip about her existence into child services @entity4 spent the next two years working for @entity63 and @entity65 who she called ' the @entity89 ' and ' the @entity90 ' , caring for the couple 's pair of twins three years younger than her and a daughter about the same age			1

' she 'd always say , " you need to pay off your sister 's debt " ' two years later , the family relocated to @entity108 , @entity16 and their abuse got even worse			1
in @entity74 , the family had a staff , but in the smaller @entity16 home @entity4 was the only doing all the work			1
she got up at 5:30am every day to get the kids ready for school and proceeded to work on the upkeep of the house for the rest of the day , scared the @entity90 would come home and criticize her cleaning			0
she never took a break for eating either since she was only allowed one meal a day - whatever was leftover from the family 's dinner			0
as for @entity4 's part of the house , the family kept her in a room without heat , air - conditioning or lighting with only a bare mattress to sleep on			2
she had to wash her clothes by hand after she learned the lesson not to use the washing and drying machines			0
when the @entity90 discovered her using the dryer one day she screamed , and said : ' your clothes are never to touch ours			0
this bucket is what you wash your clothes in , behind the house			0

on the left , speaking at an awareness event in 2008 @entity4 never considered escape out of fear of what would happen if she was found			2
' the @entity90 and the @entity89 would tell me " if you walk out the cops are going to get you and beat you and you 'll never see your family again " ' @entity4 remembers			2
she got through each day by focusing on seeing her three younger siblings again - it ' was all i thought about '			0
her lucky day came in 2002 when someone sent an anonymous tip into child services and a group of police , social workers and immigration officials stormed the house and took her away from her abusers			1
after years as a slave , @entity4 's only reaction to her freedom was fear			1
@entity63 even had the nerve to order her to conceal her identity from police			0
published : @entity4 has written a book on her experiences as a modern child slave the last thing he told her in @entity190 was : ' do n't tell them you work for us , say you 're here for a visit '			1
@entity4 contacted her parents soon after being released and instead of being happy to have their daughter back , her father was upset she left the family ' that had put a roof over my head '			1
her dad told her to return to @entity7 , but this time @entity4 made her own choice and decided to stay in the @entity151 she bounced around foster homes for the next few years and eventually became a @entity151 citizen , attended three years of community college and now she works as an assistant manager at a luggage store			1
