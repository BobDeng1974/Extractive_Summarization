by @entity1 reporter published : 12:22 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 16:46 est , 23 october 2013 like many other dogs , @entity2 loves nothing more than roaming his neighborhood , barking at passing cars and fellow canines before returning home for a bowl of biscuits and a nap in his kennel			1
the only difference is that @entity2 was born a human			2
@entity16 , 47 , has been living the life of a playful pooch for years - donning a white - and - grey costume made from paper with an over-sized collar proudly displaying his new name			1
this summer , @entity2 welcomed @entity24 's @entity23 to his home in @entity26 to look at his life as a ' furry ' - people interested in animals with human personalities or characteristics			1
when he is not wearing his homemade dog costume , left , he ties his hair into ' ears ' and wears a collar , right @entity16 adopted the persona after watching the @entity42 hit show ' @entity2 ' , which is about a stray dog who travels the world to help people , when he was a child			1
in an interview with vice three years ago , he described having a ' transformation ' in 1979 after he headed inside after a hot day and laid on the basement floor to cool down			2
' i had this waking dream of actually transforming into a dog , ' he explained			2
' it felt like i was stuck in the floor because i was really into the whole emotion of changing into a dog			1
' and i laid there for like 15 minutes , thinking about how i would break it to my parents about how i had transformed			0
it was like , wow , that was a turning point moment for me			0
' watch video from @entity66 : proud : boomer dons his paper suit and walks around the community , where people call him by his dog name dinner time : a video on @entity74 shows @entity2 eating dog food from a bowl on the floor he now eats dog food , slurps water from bowls on the floor and sleeps in an indoor doghouse fitted with a bed - which he insists is much more comfortable than a human bed			1
he does n't wear his full costume at all times ; when he wakes up in the morning , he ties his long hair into two bunches atop his head - for ' ears ' - and wears a smaller collar around his neck			2
and when he leaves the house , he carries a squeaky toy under his arm			0
in 2010 , he tried to legally change his name to @entity98 but a judge refused , claiming that the change could ' put the public welfare at risk '			0
@entity103 , an @entity104 judge , said it could cause ' confusion in the marketplace ' and that it could prove problematic if @entity16 was required as a witness to a crime			1
' consider the following example , ' judge @entity103 wrote , the @entity110 reported			0
a dog 's life : boomer stands outside his house in @entity26 , @entity116 , where he lives alone inspired : he explained that he loved the tv show ' here 's @entity2 ' and felt his transformation to a dog in the 70s ' petitioner witnesses a serious automobile accident and telephones for an emergency medical response			0
the dispatcher on the phone queries as to the caller 's identity , and the caller responds , " this is @entity98 "			0
it is not a stretch to imagine the telephone dispatcher concluding that the call is a prank and refusing to send an emergency medical response			0
' @entity2 , who is an unemployed it technician , explained that his friends , family and neighbors still call him by his dog name - which he puts down to being open about his dog persona since childhood			1
he told @entity145 that he has had a lot more positive responses than negatives ones , but he has yet to meet a ' puppy girl ' who shares his obsession			0
@entity24 explains there are other people like @entity2 living as furries , a subculture that was first recognized in the @entity155 in the 1980s			0
furries celebrate anthropomorphic animals with human characteristics including high intelligence , the ability to speak and walk on two legs , among others .			1

@entity16 , 47 , has believed he is a dog since childhood
he now sleeps in a doghouse , eats dog food from a bowl on the floor and barks at *passersby* and other dogs
he is a ' furry ' - people who are interested in animals with human personalities and characteristics
