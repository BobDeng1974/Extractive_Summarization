by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 17 february 2013 updated : 02:55 est , 18 february 2013 it 's a modern - day gold rush with small fortunes to be made – and the odd bargain to be had			2
the race is on in @entity5 to find space rocks worth tens of thousands of pounds from the 40 - ton meteor that hurtled across the @entity8 last week			1
fragments have started to appear on @entity10 , a @entity5 website for classified ads. many pieces were harvested around @entity14 , where more than 1,000 were injured as the meteor disintegrated overhead			1
one user asked for around £ 6,500 for a small piece , while another offered 18 pieces for £ 11 each			0
locals searching for meteorite fragments have gathered at a frozen lake where a chunk of meteorite hit			1
one user asked for around £ 6,500 for a small piece , while another offered 18 pieces for £ 11 each meanwhile , experts say the meteor could have hit a @entity30 city with the force of a nuclear bomb if it had entered the atmosphere at a different time of day			1
the meteor penetrated @entity37 's atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,0000mph			1
as it raced through the sky , the 50 - foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it , creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time on friday			1
although some debris fell to earth , ‘ whipping up a pillar of ice , water and steam ’ and creating a 20 - foot - wide crater , the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding			2
shockwave : people heading to work in @entity14 , @entity5 , heard what sounded like an explosion , saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them the meteor was undeniably traumatic , but it also brought a sense of co-operation in a troubled region			2
large numbers of volunteers came forward to help fix the damage caused by the explosion and many residents came together on the internet			2
many joked yesterday about what had happened in the troubled pocket of @entity5 , with one of the most popular jests : residents of the meteor were terrified to see @entity14 approaching			2
@entity14 , nicknamed @entity85 because it produced the famed @entity88 t - 34 tanks , can be as grim as its backbone heavy industries			0
in 1957 , a waste tank at the @entity93 nuclear weapons plant in the @entity94 exploded , contaminating 9,200 square miles and prompting authorities to evacuate 10,000 nearby residents			0
it is now @entity5 's main nuclear waste disposal facility and a vast plant for disposing of chemical weapons lies 50 miles east of the city			0
the focus of the meteor hunters ' efforts was a frozen reservoir outside the nearby town of @entity107 , where the largest meteorite pieces are thought to have crashed , reports the @entity109			1
@entity5 authorities stopped a group of locals searching around a hole in the ice as they want people to stay away from the fragments until scientists from @entity118 have tested them			0
@entity5 authorities also said the search for the meteorite may have to wait until spring when the region 's ice and snow thaws			1
' the web is awash with people saying they want to buy this stuff , " said @entity124 , a @entity14 local			0
' maybe this thing was not that bad after all if a few of us make some money out of it			0
' collectors from around the world will be keen to get hold of a piece			2
film director @entity138 is a noted collector			0
in october a 9in piece of the @entity141 meteorite found in @entity142 in 1960 sold in @entity143 for $ 43,750 ( £ 28,200 )			0
astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit @entity30 cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day			1
@entity148 said that when the meteor entered the atmosphere , it exploded with the force of a nuclear weapon			1
the revelation , based on an analysis of the earth 's rotation , comes as scientists reveal that they are planning a state - of - the - art detection system to give warning of incoming asteroids and meteorites , reports the @entity161			0
the announcement of the decision to build the @entity164 , or @entity165 , on @entity166 was made following the meteorite crash in @entity5			0
if the meteorite had hit at a different time of day , it could have struck the @entity30 with devastating consequences hours after a meteor exploded over @entity5 and injured more than 1,000 people and an asteroid passed relatively close to @entity37 , people in @entity173 reported seeing an unusual flash of light over the @entity179 that left many startled and thrilled			1
based on reports , the light streaking in the @entity173 sky was a sporadic meteor , or fireball , and not a major event , said @entity186 , operations manager for the @entity187 in @entity188 , @entity143			2
the group recorded at least 35 reports of the event , he said			0
' fireballs happen every single night , all around the world , ' he said			0
experts say smaller meteorites hit earth five to 10 times a year but chances of a large meteor passing , such as the one that streaked over @entity14 , @entity5 , are much rarer .			1

' meteor hunters ' are out in force as collectors offer large sums
but they may have to wait for spring for snow to thaw to search
astronomers say meteor could have hit @entity30 if the it struck at a different time
