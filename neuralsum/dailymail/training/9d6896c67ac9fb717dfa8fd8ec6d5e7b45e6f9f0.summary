by @entity0 @entity1 has broken his promise not to politicise the @entity3 quicker than a @entity5 sprint by declaring @entity6 will become the ‘ @entity7 ’			1
as @entity10 ’s athletes prepared for the 11 biggest days of their lives , the first minister resorted to his tired old ‘ @entity13 ’ rhetoric			1
he claimed he was confident @entity6 would vote @entity14 in the referendum – in the same breath as insisting he would not use the @entity3 as a campaigning pawn			1
and as @entity10 ’s biggest city welcomed competitors and spectators from around the world , the first minister snidely toasted chancellor @entity37 ’s return to @entity38			1
‘ i ’m on this self - denying ordinance , so i ’m trying not to get drawn into argy - bargy with @entity37			0
he ’ll go back to @entity38 and then we ’ll all get on with enjoying ourselves at the @entity3 , ’ mr @entity1 told the @entity40 newspaper			2
‘ that ’s what i intend to do over the next 10 days and i ’m sure i speak for everybody in @entity6 and @entity10			1
what i would say is i ’m confident yes will win in @entity6			1
‘ ( the ) latest poll indicated that swing last week and i ’m confident we will win the city of @entity6 so i suppose you could call @entity51			1
’ his bravado came despite the most recent poll of polls showing a 14 - point lead for the no campaign			2
the opening ceremony at @entity59 was dominated by tartan and references to @entity10 heritage and culture in one of the more bizarre moments , giant @entity64 were seen dancing around the arena the polls have also shown that @entity10 are desperate for a hiatus from the frequently bitter independence debate while the @entity3 is on – but the first minister - who tried to coin the term ‘ @entity73 ’ to refer to @entity10 competitors in the @entity76 team at @entity77 - could not help himself			1
he said : ‘ i think sir @entity79 put his finger on it			0
@entity82 , recently retired believes the key to success in facing the deep - seated health problems of this city and this country because it ’s not specific to @entity6 , is the sense of empowerment that independence will bring			1
‘ he thinks it will change people ’s lives for the better , not just the country and the economy , but people ’s lives and that was a very powerful message from @entity10 ’s most respected physician			2
‘ also practical things , we wo n’t have bedroom taxes and oppression of the poor which is what happens from @entity109 at present so we wo n’t have regressive policies that bear down on the poor , led by people like @entity37			0
‘ the amount of money he has taken out of this city is huge			0
’ prime minister @entity25 and wife @entity115 were seen chatting with mr @entity1 during a reception at the opening of the @entity3 during his visit , mr @entity37 pledged £ 24million to health technology , the arts and business in @entity6 , promising to turn the city into a ‘ global powerhouse ’			1
earlier this month , the @entity124 promised @entity6 would receive a £ 500million windfall – which was then matched by the @entity126 – for major infrastructure projects , which will help create 15,000 construction jobs and 28,000 permanent jobs once work is over			2
at the business conference , the prime minister also stressed the importance of @entity38 to @entity135 ’s financial district			0
‘ one of the @entity29 ’s greatest strengths is financial services			2
it ’s a @entity10 strength , too , supporting 200,000 jobs here , ’ he said			2
‘ and there is an inextricable link between the success of the @entity144 and the globally renowned financial centres of @entity135 , @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity6			2
’ mr @entity25 used a speech in @entity6 to insisted he wanted @entity10 to remain in the @entity29 political opponents urged mr @entity1 to leave the point - scoring to the athletes while the @entity3 is on			1
@entity151 , @entity152 leader said : ‘ this is desperate stuff from @entity1 who is now reverting to type as a chest - beating @entity13 cheerleader			2
‘ this is tired old rhetoric from a desperate politician trying to shore up support			0
the people of @entity6 have heard it all before			0
‘ it was free by 93 , free by 2003 , but none of it happens			0
he should focus on giving the answers to people ’s questions and cut the cheesy movie lines			0
’ @entity166 , @entity169 ’s culture and sport spokeswoman , added : ‘ these comments are offensive and misleading			0
@entity6 is already a free city and certainly does n’t need @entity1 to liberate it			0
‘ at a time when @entity6 is pulling together to put on the @entity3 , the first minister should not be playing politics			1
‘ the @entity3 are in @entity6 because politicians of all parties worked together but @entity1 seems to have broken his own promise to stop campaigning during the events on day one			1
’ he was also accused of complacency in claiming victory in the host city			0
a @entity182 spokesman said : ‘ @entity1 should not take the voters of @entity6 for granted			0
‘ he hailed victory in the city before the results of the 2012 council elections were officially announced and lost , and will be defeated again in september			0
’ @entity188 and @entity189 were at the opening ceremony of the @entity3 last night , but today she will be campaigning against @entity10 independence on her own a better together spokesman added : ‘ @entity1 not talking about his obsession for 10 days ? he ca n’t even manage 10 seconds			1
‘ we have been debating the referendum for over two years			0
it surely ca n’t be beyond even @entity1 to take a step back and let @entity6 ’s games take centre stage			0
’ meanwhile , @entity199 is to hit the campaign trail without husband @entity189 today in a move which will dramatically raise her profile			1
the environmental lawyer will climb aboard @entity169 ’s battlebus in @entity6 to urge voters to reject @entity10 independence			1
in an unusual development , mr @entity189 will not join be by her side , in what will be seen as a trial run for his wife to play a central role in next year ’s general election campaign			1
a @entity169 source said : ‘ she is up in @entity10 and wanted to take part in a bit of @entity217 campaigning			2
like lots of people in @entity169 , she feels strongly that the @entity29 should stick together			0
' it is a big question on the future of our country and she wants to take part in the campaign .			0

first minister had promised not to use the @entity3 to score political points
but in no time at all he has *restored* to his well - worn ' @entity13 ' rhetoric
he described @entity6 as ' @entity232 ' and thinks yes campaign will win
@entity25 insists @entity10 is better as part of the @entity29
@entity199 to join campaign trail without husband @entity189
