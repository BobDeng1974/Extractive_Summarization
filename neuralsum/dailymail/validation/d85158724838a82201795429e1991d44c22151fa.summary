@entity0 and @entity1 were at the centre of a spitting storm as @entity4 grabbed a last - gasp victory at @entity6 - and the pair could now be banned for six games each			1
@entity10 ’s 89th - minute winner stole three points for @entity13 ’s men following a gaffe from @entity6 goalkeeper @entity15 , but it was a clash between @entity4 defender @entity0 and his rival @entity1 that produced the main talking point of the night			1
the pair tangled during the first half at @entity22 and appeared to aim kicks at each other before the situation turned even more unsavoury			1
@entity0 appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored @entity6 striker @entity1 subsequently retaliates , and appears to aim spit of his own back at the @entity4 man @entity0 ( left ) and @entity31 near the half - way line at @entity22 following the unpleasant set - to the @entity33 are waiting for referee @entity35 's report			1
as he missed the incident between @entity0 and @entity39 , it is unlikely the it will be included in his report - meaning the @entity33 can retrospectively punish the pair			1
@entity42 striker @entity41 was banned for three games last season after being found guilty of spitting at @entity45 goalkeeper @entity46			2
however , the @entity33 have issued new guidelines to move in line with new @entity50 guidelines meaning @entity0 and @entity1 could now be banned for six games			1
as @entity1 climbed to his feet , tv footage appeared to show @entity0 spitting down on the floor in the direction of his opponent			1
@entity1 reacted by putting his head towards @entity0 and seemed to spit back at him , although it is not clear if it landed on the @entity60 international			1
the referee missed the incident meaning the @entity33 , who are waiting for @entity35 's report , can ban the pair retrospectively for six games each			1
last season @entity42 striker @entity41 was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at @entity45 goalkeeper @entity46			2
however , the @entity33 upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new @entity50 guidelines , which state that any player ' dismissed from the @entity73 for spitting at an opponent or any other person ' will be suspended ' following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his @entity78 has completed its next six matches in approved competitions			1
' if found guilty , @entity1 will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing @entity84 ’s @entity83			1
afterwards , @entity13 defended @entity0			2
‘ i did not see that ( incident ) from the bench , but i can not imagine he would do that , ’ said the @entity85			0
@entity6 head coach @entity89 said : ‘ you ca n't do it can you ? it 's one of the worst things in football			2
but i ca n't comment on it , i just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and i need to have a look at it			0
’ neither player was booked at the time by referee @entity35 , who awarded a free - kick to @entity6 for the original tangle , but if the official missed the spitting incident the pair could face retrospective action from the @entity33			1
the @entity110 striker points the finger at @entity4 's defender after the incident tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from @entity6 and @entity4 gather on the pitch former @entity4 midfielder @entity117 , covering the match as a pundit for @entity120 , slammed @entity1 while suggesting @entity0 was n’t a guilty party			1
‘ i think @entity0 is spitting on the floor			2
i know @entity0 , he ’s not that type of person , ’ he said			2
‘ if he wants to do that then it ’s not hard to miss , is it ? he ’s only stood a yard away from him			0
@entity128 does afterwards is unforgivable			0
’ @entity117 ’ colleague , @entity130 and @entity132 star @entity131 , said : ‘ i ’d like to think he ( @entity0 ) is spitting at the floor and not at @entity1			1
but then @entity1 stands up and spits right at @entity0 ’ neck from about six inches			1
’ @entity13 , meanwhile , was relieved to see @entity10 steal three points on a night when all of the top four won			2
‘ i was very pleased with the win , especially here , ’ he said			0
‘ i lost here as a coach of @entity141 and @entity142			0
i knew it was difficult and @entity144 said there is a lot of pressure from the crowd			0
but we made the crowd quiet			0
the players share heated moments at @entity22 as they exchange points of view ‘ but we do n’t reward ourselves ( with goals )			0
if you do n’t reward yourselves you can get negative results and @entity158 had to make two fantastic saves			0
‘ it was important to win after you see all of the results of our competitors in our rat race			0
‘ everyone is now full of confidence going into the @entity169 game with @entity170			0
’ as for @entity89 , he was furious that @entity6 were denied an early penalty when @entity172 fouled @entity173			2
‘ it ’s frustrating and i ’m so disappointed for the guys , ’ he said			0
‘ for 89 minutes we were outstanding but we do n’t have world - class players like they do			0
‘ to concede like we did is disappointing but what is more disappointing is the blatant penalty in the first half which was not given			0
@entity35 is a human - being and he ’s missed it			1
that would have set us up nicely			0

the pair collided near half - way line and @entity0 appeared to spit at @entity186
@entity1 appeared to retaliate in kind , aiming spit back at @entity4 's @entity0
referee @entity35 missed the incident and neither player was booked but the @entity33 could ban the pair retrospectively for six games each
@entity4 won the game 1 - 0 thanks to @entity10 's late strike
