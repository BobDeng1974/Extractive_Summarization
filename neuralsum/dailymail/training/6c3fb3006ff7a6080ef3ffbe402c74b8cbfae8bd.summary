@entity1 gov. @entity0 said monday morning that it 's a mistake to classify a recent beheading murder in @entity4 , @entity5 as a case of workplace violence , since the alleged perpetrator was a radical muslim who reportedly shouted @entity12 slogans as he wielded his blade			1
' at some point in time , ' @entity0 said on the @entity15 , ' i think the [ @entity18 ] administration does have to address this as what it appears to many people that it is : an act of violence that is associated with terrorism			1
' but according to the @entity26 , the @entity25 has stuck the ' workplace violence ' label on the case of @entity29 , a 30 - year - old recent muslim convert who police say decapitated one coworker and stabbed another shortly after he was fired from his job at a food processing plant			1
@entity1 gov. @entity0 said monday that the @entity5 beheading was a case that looked more like terrorism than ' workplace violence ' @entity29 , the beheading suspect , is a recent muslim convert with a long rap sheet who had already served at least two years in prison @entity5 beheading suspect @entity29 ( right ) calls himself ' @entity45 ' on his @entity47 page ; army maj. @entity48 ( left ) was sentenced to death for killing 13 on a military base			1
both cases are classified as ' workplace violence ' his dismissal reportedly followed an argument among employees over whether strict followers of @entity57 are correct in calling for the stoning deaths of women who commit certain offenses			1
' i think @entity62 are n't confused about this what this is , ' @entity0 told the ' @entity67 ' program			0
' this is a clear case of an individual going in and doing something that does n't meet their definition of workplace violence			1
' ' so you know , ' @entity0 said , ' i think any rational thinking @entity62 is going to look at this and go , " this is more than just normal workplace violence "			1
' the federal government still classifies the 2009 @entity79 shooting in @entity1 as workplace violence as well			1
critics have slammed authorities in @entity5 for treating the beheading as ' workplace violence ' rather than an act of terrorism			1
the @entity47 page of suspect @entity29 has anti-american rants under the name ' @entity90 ' and he has also posted photos of @entity92			1
it also shows a man with a quote : ' i will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers : smile ye above their necks and smite all their fingertips off them			0
' police , however , are still classifying it as a ' workplace violence ' incident			1
@entity107 , a @entity108 terrorism expert , told @entity67 on saturday that the beheading was an act of terrorism and should be characterized that way			2
' calling it workplace violence is counterproductive , ' he said			2
@entity115 , ceo of the @entity116 and a former homeland security chief of staff and @entity119 official , said : ' you 'll see this change very shortly			0
' ' the only thing that is causing a pause , i think , is the fact that the triggering event was the termination of his employment			0
' army maj. @entity48 , a psychiatrist who had the words ' soldier of @entity132 ' added to his official military business cards , killed 13 and injured 32 when he opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women			1
last month @entity48 wrote from his jail cell to the self - declared ' caliph ' of @entity139 , the terrorist @entity140 , asking to be granted citizenship			2
in 2013 he told a judge that he planned to defend himself at trial by arguing that he was acting ' in defense of others ' with his killings			0
asked who he was defending , @entity48 told a judge it was the leadership of the @entity150 of @entity151 , the @entity152 and its leader @entity153 â€“ since the @entity79 troops were expected to deploy to @entity151 soon after @entity48 went on his murder spree			2
@entity48 was convicted on 13 premeditated murder charges and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder , and sentenced to death			0
survivors of his attack have been denied @entity162 and other combat benefits because the government refuses to reclassify the shootings as terror - related			0
@entity29 has served prison sentences before , with concurrent two - year stays for marijuana possession , assaulting a highway patrol trooper , and cocaine possession			0
he was released years early following the recalculation of his sentence for good behavior behind bars			0
his mother released a @entity47 video on saturday in which she apologized to her son 's victims but cautioned that ' there are two sides to every story			0
' flags and crosses honored those killed and wounded in the 2009 ' workplace violence ' rampage of @entity187 , whose business card read ' soldier of @entity132 ' @entity1 gov. @entity0 said monday that the @entity5 beheading was a case that looked more like terrorism than ' workplace violence ' emotional : employees and friends waited for word about loved ones as police investigated the beheading on thursday ' my heart is just so heavy right now , ' @entity199 said in the video			1
' that 's not my son			0
' it emerged monday that mr. @entity29 's beheading victim , 54 - year - old @entity206 , was a grandmother who had lost her home in a tornado			2
he was shot during his rampage by a sheriff 's deputy who also owned the food processing plant where he worked			0
but he regained consciousness by saturday and law enforcement officers weer able to question him			2
police sgt. @entity214 said @entity29 will be charged monday with first - degree murder , and with assault and battery with a deadly weapon			0
he may also face federal charges .			0

@entity1 governor blasted the @entity18 administration for refusing to call beheading attack ' what it appears to many people that it is : an act of violence that is associated with terrorism '
@entity25 is investigating whether terrorism linked to the @entity5 killing , but law enforcement is currently treating it as ' workplace violence '
that same label still sticks to the 2009 @entity79 , @entity1 shooting in which a @entity237 psychiatrist with the words ' soldier of @entity132 ' on his business cards shot 13 people to death
@entity29 , 30 , allegedly shouted @entity140 phrases as he beheaded one woman and stabbed another in @entity4 , @entity5 on sept. 25
@entity29 has an *extensive* rap sheet , had recently converted to @entity57 , tried to convert his coworkers , and *celebrated* @entity12 terrorism on @entity47
