by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:45 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:47 est , 20 december 2013 @entity4 expats in @entity5 have described their daring rescue by @entity8 pilots as the @entity10 nation teeters on the brink of civil war			1
hundreds of @entity13 packed onto the runway at @entity15 desperately waiting for the @entity16 to spirit them to safety while the distant sound of gunfire grew louder			1
but minutes before the 266 - tonne plane was due to arrive , a @entity5 passenger jet crash landed on the tarmac making it impossible far any other plane to touch down			1
@entity26 , who was waiting for evacuation , said the nose undercarriage of the @entity29 appeared to have collapsed with the sound of an explosion as it landed completely blocking their only escape route			0
stricken : the @entity5 @entity35 , owned by @entity36 , crash landed on the runway blocking the @entity4 @entity38 from landing relief : hundreds of @entity4 expats packed onto the plane after the daring landing as they fled the country that sits on the brink of all - out civil war above them circled the @entity16 , which had completed a nine - hour , 3,500 - mile journey from @entity50 air base in @entity51 , as air chiefs in @entity4 prepared to call off the mission and try again tomorrow			1
but by a stroke of luck , a crane belonging to the @entity55 happened to have been left in a nearby yard and the @entity5 jet was eventually towed out of the way , allowing the pilot of the @entity16 to make what the @entity62 described as a ' daring , precision landing ' on the cleared runway			1
globemaster : the @entity16 ( pictured ) is designed to carry out high - angle , steep approaches at relatively slow speeds , which allows it to operate into small airfields with short , narrow runways in difficult conditions mr @entity26 , from @entity72 in @entity73 , told @entity74 's today programme that until sunday , @entity15 had seemed calm with ' no warning of any trouble '			1
but on monday morning , he was told not to leave his hotel			0
' we were hearing gunshots , ' he said			0
' but things really picked up quite dramatically after about 9 o'clock in the morning when there were gun battles pretty much all around @entity15 , as best we could tell			0
' there was shooting close to the hotel and it was actually closer the following day , but we could n't tell who it was			0
we were told it was government soldiers fighting rebels or insurgents , whatever you want to call them			0
' of the rescue , he added : ' it was chaotic , because we arrived at the airport before 10 o'clock in the morning and we had to wait to try to find out what was happening			0
' one of the @entity5 airlines , @entity36 , came in with a flight - it may well have been a charter flight for evacuation - and on landing we heard an explosion and we subsequently saw the aircraft and the front landing gear had collapsed			1
whether a tyre had burst or whether it was the collapse of the landing kit i do n't know , but it left the @entity29 stuck in the middle of the runway			2
fears : as the @entity4 expats waited for the @entity16 to spirit them to safety , the distant sound of gunfire echoed from the streets of @entity15 , growing louder power struggle : on sunday president @entity120 ( pictured ) said that troops loyal to his ousted vice president @entity122 opened fire on a government meeting in an attempted coup ' we were told that the @entity8 plane was going to do a fly - past to look at the runway			1
obviously their intention was to see if they could land on what remained of the runway			0
they did that and decided that they could n't land , in fact			0
then there was an announcement on the ground that the flight was going to be delayed until the next day , which caused some other problems			0
' but at that point , while the aircraft was still there , they managed to find a crane from the @entity55 and move the damaged aircraft off the runway			0
fortunately , the @entity8 plane was still circling and was able to land very quickly			1
' dangers : @entity154 president @entity153 has warned that @entity5 's ' great progress ' towards breaking the cycle of violence in the country could be undone by this latest spate of fighting the commanding officer of the @entity8 's @entity162 , wing commander @entity163 , said : ' we practise short landings in training but getting down on a runway with a crashed aircraft taking up a large part of it would really concentrate the mind and is way outside what we would normally expect			1
' i think it 's fair to say that this @entity16 captain and his crew have had one of the toughest days anyone on this squadron has had since we were stood up 12 years ago			1
it 's not just the air crew but the @entity8 regiment who provided protection on the ground , the movers who helped get the passengers on board , the medics and the engineers - all of them have all performed brilliantly and i 'm extremely proud of them			1
' on board the @entity8 aircraft were medics , force protection and air movements personnel , and @entity201 officials whose job was to assist people wanting to leave the country			2
some 182 @entity4 and @entity204 and @entity206 citizens were evacuated to @entity207 , 350 miles away in neighbouring @entity208 , but some had to leave their luggage behind at the airport			0
' they told us that normally on one of these @entity216 transporters they can take 132 passengers , ' said mr @entity26			0
' in the end they just filled it up as much as they could			0
people had to leave their luggage pretty much on the runway at @entity15 and they put on everybody they could			0
the final number was 182 , which they said was a record for this kind of operation			0
' since the fighting started @entity231 has imposed a night time curfew and has arrested ten former ministers the @entity16 is designed to carry out high - angle , steep approaches at relatively slow speeds , which allows it to operate into small airfields with short , narrow runways in difficult conditions			1
within the last year it has used these capabilities delivering aid to typhoon victims in the @entity243 and transporting military equipment to @entity245 and the @entity246			0
fighting has spread through the newly formed @entity10 state , which gained its independence in 2011 , following a reported coup attempt in the capital at the weekend			0
the conflict in @entity5 began on sunday when troops loyal to ousted vice president @entity122 allegedly opened fire at a government meeting in an attempt to force president @entity120 ( pictured ) from power			1
@entity122 was sacked along with the entire rest of the cabinet in july after announcing he was going to contest the 2015 general election			2
fears that fighting could spread into all - out civil war stem from the fact that @entity120 is from the minority @entity267 ethnic group , while @entity122 is a @entity269			1
around 20,000 @entity5 are now sheltering in @entity55 camps , with the @entity272 base being attacked yesterday with the possible death of civilians			2
as well as drawing the attention of the @entity154 president , the conflict has also concerned neighbouring @entity10 states including @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity208 who have sent mediators to attempt to find a resolution			1
in a statement on thursday , @entity120 said he was willing to talk to anyone who would listen , but that he was unsure what the possible outcome could be			2
the @entity201 has strongly advised all remaining @entity4 nationals to leave the country amid fears it could prove difficult to get out if there is any further deterioration in the situation			0
' the @entity4 plans to send a second flight to @entity5 to evacuate @entity4 nationals who wish to leave from @entity15 on friday december 20 , following the evacuation of some @entity4 nationals on december 19 , ' a @entity201 spokesman said			2
meanwhile , president @entity153 has said @entity5 ' stands on the precipice ' of civil war as conflict in the country enters its sixth day			1
the @entity154 has sent 45 troops to the young state to protect its embassy in the capital of @entity15 , which has seen at least 500 people killed in violence so far			1
in a statement the president said : ' in 2011 , millions of @entity5 voted to forge a new nation , founded on the promise of a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of @entity5 's people			1
' in recent years , against great odds , @entity5 has made great progress toward breaking the cycle of violence that characterized much of its history			2
' today , that future is at risk			0
@entity5 stands at the precipice			2
recent fighting threatens to plunge @entity5 back into the dark days of its past			2
' the @entity328 has issued a warning to @entity154 citizens in the country that they should leave immediately , and has evacuated all non-emergency government personnel			1
elsewhere @entity5 government officials have said that rebels are in control of the town of @entity337 , 125 miles north of the capital , and that the military is using heavy artillery			2
@entity4 nationals seeking to leave @entity5 were urged to contact the @entity201 in @entity342 for advice on +44 207 008 1500 or by emailing crisis@fco.gsi.gov.uk .			0
