@entity0 and her former boyfriend @entity1 are ' fearing the worst ' as @entity3 's highest court prepares to decide their fate , according to their entourage			1
@entity6 is waiting for the verdict in their final appeal for the murder of @entity13 student @entity11 at home in @entity15 , while her one - time lover is in @entity17 for the hearing at the city 's imposing @entity19 , nicknamed the @entity21 or ' @entity22 '			1
@entity1 could be seen arriving at court this morning with his current girlfriend @entity24 , before appearing deep in thought as he left this evening after the case was adjourned until friday morning			1
@entity6 's lawyer @entity27 described her client as ' very worried ' about adding : ' she has n't been sleeping much			2
' @entity30 also scotched rumours that the @entity32 had been trying to get pregnant to avoid possible extradition			0
' that is absolutely false			0
she is not engaged either , ' he said			0
however , it has now been revealed @entity6 's lawyers have turned to the @entity39 in a last ditch attempt to stop the final ratification of her conviction for murder			2
they have asked for the case to be suspended , pending the acceptance of her appeal to the @entity39 against a conviction for slander			0
she has always denied murdering ms @entity88 ( right ) @entity6 claims that she was coerced by police into making false statements blaming the murder on bar owner @entity11 during interrogations of more than 40 hours in november 2007			1
as the slander is considered circumstantial evidence in her murder trial , her legal team asked for the murder trial to be suspended , @entity6 defence lawyer @entity94 confirmed			2
but the move has left representatives of the @entity88 family shocked			0
the @entity88 's lawyer @entity103 said : ‘ if the @entity105 court condemns the @entity3 , what would it change ? what could it usefully serve ? absolutely nothing			2
’ meanwhile , a consultant for @entity1 said that he had already said his goodbyes to his family and air hostess girlfriend @entity24 , who accompanied him to the packed courtroom this morning , where neither was able to find a seat			2
the assistant said : ' it is as if he is not there anymore			0
he said goodbye to his family and @entity24 outside the court			0
' @entity6 and @entity1 served four years for the brutal murder of @entity122 student miss @entity88 in @entity123 in 2007			1
she was found half naked with multiple stab wounds to her body and a deep gash in her throat			0
the pair were freed on appeal in 2011			0
but last year , they were sensationally reconvicted and ordered to serve 28 and 25 years respectively for the murder			0
now the @entity19 can opt to confirm the convictions , in which case extradition proceedings would start against @entity6			2
or if they find contradictions or illogicality in the guilty sentence they could send the trial back to appeal stage			0
@entity1 has asked to have his case annulled on the basis that it should have been separated from that of @entity6 , as all the proof points to her			1
@entity0 and @entity1 in their infamous clinch after they were named as suspects in ms @entity88 's murder			2
@entity1 now claims their stories on the night of ms @entity88 's death are not ' intertwined ' @entity1 ( right ) has seemingly abandoned all loyalty to @entity6 ( left ) with his bid to distance himself from her @entity1 out with his girlfriend @entity24 ( left )			1
@entity6 ( right ) is pictured in @entity15 on a recent outing one of the world 's leading dna experts , who has extensively investigated the murder of @entity160 , has claimed the forensic evidence against @entity0 and @entity1 is ' incredulous ' and ' made up ' by prosecutors			1
' @entity6 , 27 , and @entity1 , 30 , stand accused of killing the @entity13 student in @entity123 and the @entity3 @entity19 is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today			1
professor @entity166 , a lecturer of @entity167 at @entity168 , @entity169 , looked in - depth at the dna results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the @entity174 and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal			0
in an exclusive interview with the @entity180 , professor @entity178 admits that the evidence against @entity6 and @entity1 is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional csi tv series			2
he said : ' it 's very , very tenuous to use this [ @entity187 ] evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves an activity such as stabbing a victim			0
if @entity194 ' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant , according to @entity3 legal experts			0
there has also been speculation that political pressure from the @entity32 could hamper the extradition process			0
@entity1 is reportedly seeking to separate his case from @entity6 's , with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the @entity32 and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime			1
if that argument succeeds , the @entity3 could be given a new trial			0
since being convicted @entity1 has deserted @entity6 , his one - time lover , and is now insisting that their positions are ' not intertwined '			1
his case should have been considered independently of @entity6 's , he now insists			2
yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that @entity1 claims he does not remember whether @entity6 was with him at the time of ms @entity88 's murder			1
in a dramatic change in legal strategy , @entity1 has cast serious doubt on @entity0 's alibi , with the @entity3 now saying he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the @entity13 student was brutally murdered			1
all the evidence against the former couple points to @entity6 , @entity1 claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make - or - break @entity19 hearing today			1
ms @entity88 , a 21 - year - old student from @entity229 , @entity230 , ( left ) was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in @entity123 in 2007			1
@entity6 ( right ) is appealing a decision reinstating what was her conviction for killing @entity88 @entity11 is serving a 16 - year sentence for his involvement in @entity88 's death after a separate trial the house in @entity123 where @entity13 student @entity11 was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 supporters of @entity0 are convinced that her guilty verdict for murder will be upheld by the @entity3 @entity19 when they make their decision later this week			1
@entity32 @entity0 and @entity3 @entity1 both stand accused of killing @entity13 student @entity11 and have been tried three times for the crime			1
the last hearing , in january last year , again found them guilty			0
@entity6 's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber - stamped by the @entity19 today			2
people close to the case do not believe ms @entity0 stands a chance in the hugely - divisive case			0
one supporter said they were prepared for the ' greatest miscarriage of justice ' that has ever happened to a @entity32 citizen			0
in their previous two trials , @entity6 maintained that they were together at @entity1 's flat on the night of the murder after which miss @entity88 , 21 , was found half - naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with @entity6 in @entity123 , @entity3			1
in an a-z of reasons for distancing his position from hers , @entity1 's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against @entity6 does not concern him			1
in the 306 - page paper , @entity1 claims that his computer records prove he was watching the @entity278 @entity277 cartoon @entity279 at the time of the alleged murder			2
but he is not sure whether @entity6 was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana			0
the document says : ' the defence intends to emphasise that @entity1 has always shown himself to be extraneous to the crime , and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home			0
however , he did not rule out that @entity6 could have gone out			0
' the document also points out that @entity6 , unlike @entity1 , had an alleged motive for the murder			1
emotional : @entity0 breaks down in tears after hearing her 2009 conviction for murdering her @entity13 roommate @entity11 is to be overturned and she will be acquited @entity0 ( right ) acknowledges the cheers of supporters while her mother @entity296 comforts her on her return home to @entity15 , @entity299 , in october 2011 after winning an appeal against her conviction this photo in november 2007 shows @entity6 ( left ) and @entity1 together			1
the pair were 20 and 24 at the time the report explaining the motivation refers to a statement that @entity11 made to police that miss @entity88 believed @entity6 stole € 300 and two credits cards from her			2
@entity309 - born @entity308 is serving a 16 - year jail sentence for his involvement in @entity88 's death after a separate trial			1
judges ruled he did not act alone			0
@entity1 , by contrast with @entity6 , ' had no reason to want the death of @entity11			1
' the document states : ' the alleged motives [ not getting along and the missing € 300 ] concern only relations between the victim and @entity0 , not @entity1			0
