it was shot into space six months ago , with the promise that the finder would be able to keep the £ 12,000 prize			1
but when a sparkling diamond lost contact with a gps signal it was thought to have been lost forever , leaving dozens of disappointing hunters in its wake			1
and married couple @entity12 and @entity13 now have their inquisitive dog to thank for finding the perfect @entity17 present while out on a walk in @entity19 - the missing 1.14 carat diamond			1
he then raced back when he remembered what it was			0
the rock was shot into the air as part of a pr stunt in august			2
it was put in a helium balloon which was expected to pop when the precious cargo reached 100,000ft , causing it to fall down back to the earth			1
however as it fell , attached to a distinctive orange parachute , the gps signal was lost and the precious gemstone appeared to have vanished			1
mr @entity13 , 75 , was out walking his two dogs , springer spaniel @entity24 and @entity52 , a @entity54 cross , along a country path in the village of @entity57 , @entity19 , when @entity24 ' got scent of something ' and quickly ran under a hedge			1
mr @entity13 , a retired lorry driver , said @entity24 was ' scrabbling about ' for 10 minutes before dragging a package - attached to a limp orange parachute - out of the hedgerow on december 23			1
the pensioner said : ' i was walking @entity24 and @entity52 along a country path and nosey @entity24 suddenly darted under a hedge and got a hold of something big			0
' she took about 10 minutes dragging it our from under the hedge and i saw that it was covered in mud and leaves			0
the precious gemstone was launched attached to a helium balloon and orange parachute and was meant to float back to earth so it could be found , but as it descended the gps signal with the craft was lost mr and mrs @entity83 have just celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary and will probably sell the diamond ' i did n't fancy carrying it for the rest of the walk , so decided to leave it until we walked back along the road on our way home			1
' it was n't until about 30 minutes later that mr @entity13 realised it could be the diamond everyone was searching for and he dashed back to the hedge to retrieve the package			1
he added : ' i looked a bit closer and saw the package had an orange parachute underneath it and details of who to contact written on it - and i knew it must be the diamond			0
' i got back to the car and drove home to open it up in a state of some excitement			0
' the diamond was thought to have landed within a five mile radius of the village of @entity116 in @entity19 - about 10 miles from @entity57 - in august and thousands of treasure hunters flocked to the area to search for the valuable gem with no success			1
when mr @entity13 got home he told his wife of 25 years , @entity124 and they opened the box to find the diamond inside and a number to call			1
mr @entity13 said his dog @entity24 , a springer spaniel , got a scent for something and pulled the diamond from a bush the diamonds were launched in august with the promise that whoever found the box could keep the gems mrs @entity83 called bosses at 77 diamonds , which organised the stunt , telling them her husband had found the missing sparkler under a hedge			1
she was congratulated on the find , but has yet to decide on whether to have the 1.14 carat diamond set in a ring or sell it			1
she said : ' @entity12 and i have kept our eyes open since the diamond went missing , but everyone was looking for the diamond around the village of @entity116 , so @entity12 never expected to find it in @entity57 , which is about 10 miles away			2
' i could n't believe it when we opened it up - you could have knocked me down with a feather			0
' i suppose if i led a glamorous lifestyle i would be wearing it out and about in all the best places , but i do n't lead a rip - roaring lifestyle , so such a beautiful diamond might be wasted on me			0
' @entity12 got me a lovely bracelet for my @entity17 , but this diamond has trumped it - just a bit ! ' the box was launched from a remote village in @entity170 and was expected to descend hours later but the diamond failed to return where it was expected and was thought to have been lost the couple are planning to sell the diamond and go on a @entity176 cruise to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary			2
mr @entity13 , who worked as a lorry driver for 44 years , said @entity24 - would be getting a special treat , adding : ' both the dogs will get something special			2
' i imagine a rib - eye steak would go down well - it 's the least they deserve			0
' @entity185 , a member of @entity186 and a former policeman for the village , said excitement had ' swept through the village ' when news got out about the diamond in august			0
the £ 12,000 diamond was hand - picked for its ' brilliance and sparkle ' and is a ' modified cushion brilliant cut ' , similar to the engagement rings of @entity198 and @entity199			2
bosses at 77 diamonds , which takes its name from the first ever diamond engagement ring given by archduke @entity204 to @entity205 in 1477 , say the ' stunt ' was to raise awareness of the firm 's access to 80 per cent of the world 's finest polished diamonds			0
the diamond is similar to the sparkling engagement rings worn by @entity199 and @entity198 @entity214 , co-founder of 77 diamonds said : ' having launched the diamond into space back in august we were starting to doubt whether it would ever be found			2
' it really captured the imagination of the nation at the time and we were overwhelmed by the thousands of people who joined in the treasure hunt to find it			0
' we were very surprised to receive the call from @entity124 after so many months of searching and just find it even more remarkable that it should be discovered at @entity17			0
' this , coupled with the fact that @entity124 and her husband @entity12 are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary makes it even more wonderful			0
' we hope they get great pleasure from the diamond and enjoy recounting their exciting story of discovered treasure			0
