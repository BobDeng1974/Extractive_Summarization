by @entity0 astronauts have fitted the first hd webcams to the @entity3 today following a tense spacewalk			1
@entity5 and @entity6 were able to get both of the groundbreaking cameras working perfectly , unlike their first attempt where a spacewalk was abandoned			1
people will be able to access the live footage on a website and the webcams could be used to provide high resolution imagery of the planet for environmental monitoring and to help with humanitarian relief efforts			1
here , a simulation of what the site will look like , shows a satellite image of @entity29 as well as a map and the what the camera has filmed there are two cameras , the world 's first 1 - @entity35 , high - resolution @entity22 video camera and a medium - resolution imaging camera			1
as the @entity3 circles the world 16 times per day , the two cameras will constantly be rolling and capturing unique videos and imagery of different locations underneath			2
phase 1 of the project will see two cameras facing the ground , with one having a fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of interest			2
the two men worked so hard — determined to accomplish the job this time — that @entity56 outside @entity57 urged them to ' get your breath			0
' ' we 'll force ourselves to rest , ' one of the spacewalkers replied in @entity64			0
the astronauts had hooked up the @entity22 - observing cameras during a spacewalk right after @entity68			1
but ground controllers received no data from the cameras , and the spacewalkers had to haul everything back in			0
the problem was traced to indoor cabling and fixed , according to @entity75			0
this time , after the spacewalkers reattached the high - definition camera to the outside of the @entity64 portion of the space station , good electrical connectivity was reported between the instrument and @entity56			1
@entity75 spokesman @entity82 said @entity64 flight controllers were pleased with the results			0
' the second time a charm for its installation and activation , ' @entity82 said			0
next , @entity5 and @entity6 tackled the medium - resolution camera			1
images from these new cameras will be distributed by the @entity92 company that owns them , @entity91 ( pronounced @entity94 the cameras were launched to the space station last november in a deal between the @entity98 - based @entity91 and the @entity99			1
@entity91 will post near - real - time video on its website and sell images			1
the company envisions customers wanting video feeds for environmental , agricultural and humanitarian purposes			2
the company expects it will take three months to calibrate the cameras , and that the system should be fully operational by summer			2
because of all the camera data trouble during the dec. 27 spacewalk , which dragged on for eight hours , @entity5 and @entity6 had to put off other chores			0
those tasks were on monday 's to - do list			0
the four other space station astronauts — two @entity120 , one @entity116 and another @entity64 — kept tabs on the spacewalk from inside			0
the cameras blasted off from @entity64 today and once installed on the @entity3 ( illustrated ) , will beam live footage of our planet to @entity22 @entity64 flight controllers outside @entity57 directed monday 's 260 - mile - high excursion the firm behind the project says that anyone will be able to see the footage via a special website and customers will also be able to buy customised pictures			1
basic accounts are free and provide a live stream of imagery as the cameras fly overhead and time lapses of favourite places			2
premium accounts for enable users paying a fee to track an area without sharing it with others and to monitor larger areas of interest as well as applying image processing techniques to reveal data			0
‘ this is the biggest milestone @entity91 has achieved thus far , ’ explained co-founder , president and chief operating officer , @entity152			0
‘ this will be the world ’s first ever high definition , live - streaming video platform of planet earth from the @entity3			2
’ phase 1 of the project will see two cameras facing the ground , with one having a fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of interest			0
the company ’s aim is to make @entity22 video data more accessible to individuals and schoolchildren , who will be able to log in on @entity91 ’s website , as well as the traditional customers of government and private companies			1
‘ video and still image data captured by the cameras will be downlinked to ground stations across the planet and displayed on the @entity91 web platform , or distributed directly to exclusive partners and customers , ’ the firm said			2
the company said this will be the world 's first ever high definition , live - streaming video platform of planet earth from the @entity3 two cameras will be fixed to the @entity3 : the world 's first 1 - metre class , high - resolution @entity22 video camera and a medium - resolution imaging camera here is an illustration of a camera filming a strip of the earth below			1
the cameras will be installed on the @entity3 sometime in december 2013 and are expected to go live in 2014 ‘ @entity91 's cameras will provide high - resolution video and imagery of @entity22 that will allow for monitoring of the environment , humanitarian relief , social events and agricultural land			1
’ current sponsors on the high profile project include the @entity208 , and the firm is working with the @entity64 aerospace giant @entity210			0
it is expected to take two spacewalks to install both cameras , and they will last for at least five years			0
the @entity3 circles the world 16 times a day , and @entity91 said its cameras will be constantly rolling and capturing unique videos of different locations under its path ( illustrated in orange ) the company 's aim is to make @entity22 video data more accessible to individuals and schoolchildren , who will be able to log in on @entity91 's website			1

@entity92 company @entity91 's cameras were fitted on their second attempt - after a first spacewalk failed to get them working
there are two cameras , the world 's first 1 - @entity35 , high - resolution @entity22 video camera and a medium - resolution imaging camera
the webcams will be used to provide high resolution imagery of @entity22 , which will be accessible *online* and could help with humanitarian relief efforts
