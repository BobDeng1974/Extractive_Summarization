two of the rarest turtles in the world have been washed ashore on the west coast of @entity4 after being swept almost 5,000 miles from its usual home in the warm waters of the @entity8			1
the juvenile @entity10 turtles , which are critically endangered , were discovered on beaches in @entity13 and @entity14			1
it is thought the dinner - plate sized reptiles had been left too weak to fight against the ocean currents by unusually cold weather in the @entity8			1
this juvenile @entity10 remains in a critical condition after being found barely alive on a beach on @entity21 , off @entity22 in @entity14 , 4,660 miles from its usual home in warm waters of the @entity8 the ' cold stunned ' turtles are thought to have been carried across the @entity26 by the @entity27 together with strong westerly winds			1
there are only 30 record incidents of @entity10 turtles being stranded on @entity33 and @entity4 beaches in the past			1
they may spend their lives swimming the world 's oceans hunting jelly fish and shell fish from the sea floor , but it seems that sea turtles can suffer decompression sickness			1
scientists have diagnosed the sickness for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles			2
the bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in surrounding pressure , such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive			0
in humans , it can produce many symptoms from joint pain to paralysis and death , but it is not known what animals feel			0
however , it appears that turtles that surface from a deep dive too quickly can also suffer from the condition			0
those accidentally caught in fishing nets are most likely to suffer			0
most have been washed ashore already dead , so experts say to find the two turtles alive is extremely rare			2
however , one of the turtles - found on @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity13 , - has since died while the other remains alive			1
marine biologists believe there may be other turtles that have suffered the same fate and have asked the public to be vigilant			1
@entity83 , strandings coordinator of the @entity4 @entity84 , said : ' it looks like there has been a large cold standing event off the eastern seaboard of the @entity89			1
' the sea temperatures dropped causing large numbers of @entity10 turtles to become cold stunned			1
' this condition leaves the turtles in a lethargic condition unable to feed or swim against strong currents			0
' mr @entity83 added that the surviving turtle will be flown back the a rescue centre in @entity99 so it can be released back into the wild			0
he said : ' these are the rarest turtles in the world so even just a few individuals being lost in this way can impact the populuation			0
' the turtles were swept 4,664 miles from their usual breeding grounds in the @entity8 by strong currents this juvenile @entity10 turtle was found alive on @entity76 beach in @entity77 , @entity13 , by walker @entity110 ( pictured holding the reptile ) but it later died despite being taken into care by the @entity113 there are an estimated 1,000 - 5,000 breeding females left in the world , which all next on just a single beach in @entity119			1
during the 1980s their numbers were reduced to just a few hundred but a major conservation effort , including translocating eggs from @entity119 to a beach in @entity125 , has seen their numbers increase			0
the smallest of the sea turtles , they can grow to be up to 70cm ( 27 inches ) long and weigh up to 60kg ( 132 lbs )			2
they normally feed on crabs and other crustaceans around the @entity8 and the @entity133			2
in the past most @entity10 turtles that are swept to @entity4 tend to have damaged flippers or are two young to fight the strong currents of the @entity27			1
however , most have been found on beaches in @entity138 and @entity139			0
the @entity10 found in @entity14 was too weak to swim after being stunned by cold water temperatures the rescued turtles are around the size of dinner plates and are thought to be juveniles too weak to swim against the strong ocean currents and winds that have swept across the @entity26 during the past month the most recent turtles were found far further north and experts believe strong winds in december helped carry them there			1
the first was discovered on @entity76 beach in @entity77 , @entity13 by @entity152 , from @entity153 , on saturday 20 december while he was walking with his girlfriend			1
he told the @entity155 : ' at first i thought it was a crab			0
it seemed to be in a stupor as if there was n't much life left in it			0
' my firstt thought was to put it back in the sea , so i walked out into some deeper water and it swam away			2
' i have since heard i should nâ€™t have done that and i do feel bad about it			0
' however , the turtle washed ashore again nearby on monday 22 december and was taken into care by the @entity113			0
the surviving turtle is now being cared for by specialist vets at the @entity174 in @entity175 the second turtle was discovered on a beach on @entity21 on sunday 21 december and was taken to the @entity174 in @entity175 , where it is being cared for by specialist vets			1
experts are now warning that anyone who finds a turtle should not try to put them back into the sea			0
dr @entity184 , @entity185 at the @entity186 said : ' we advise never to put live stranded turtles in the @entity4 back in the sea as they will almost certainly perish			2
' @entity190 , marine conservation officer with the @entity192 , added : ' it is rare for non-native turtles to be washed ashore in the @entity195 but there have been strong westerly winds over december			2
' stray juveniles can sometimes be carried by strong currents from warmer seas and this might explain why they are so far away from home			0
' anyone who finds a stranded turtle should report it to the @entity84 on 0800 6520333 or at @entity206 .			0

two juvenile @entity10 turtles were found alive by walkers on @entity76 beach , in @entity77 , @entity13 , and on @entity21 , off @entity22 in @entity14
@entity10 are normally found in the warm waters of the @entity8
low sea temperatures are thought to have ' cold stunned ' the two turtles
one of the turtles has since died but the other is to be *returned* to the @entity89
marine biologists warn that more @entity10 turtles may be stranded
@entity224 's *ridleys* are critically endangered and number just a few thousand
