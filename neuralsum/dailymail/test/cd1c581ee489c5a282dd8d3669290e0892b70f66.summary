that is all @entity2 has needed to bring @entity3 out from the morgue and into life			1
rigor mortis was setting in when he took over the club , but now the muscles are being flexed			2
an fa cup final awaits			0
there have been mistakes , notably in defeats to @entity13 and @entity14 , but five glorious wins and a brand of football to excite and embolden far outweighs them			0
having been appointed on @entity20 , @entity3 fans have fallen in love after only nine weeks			1
here , @entity22 looks at five reasons for @entity2 ’s success			1
@entity2 has had an inspired start in charge of @entity3 as they reached the @entity29 final @entity31 's back upon arrival , @entity2 recognised the area he needed to target instantly : goals			1
hardly rocket science but launching @entity3 ’s scoring figures skywards was easier said than done			1
straightaway as manager he had a sit down in his office with @entity31 where he told the @entity41 striker : ‘ two years ago , every club in @entity43 wanted you			2
’ the point being to re-inject confidence in this quiet character			0
@entity31 is determined but responds well to arm - round - shoulder words			2
at the end of his reign , @entity49 tried stick to inspire @entity31 ’s best , dropping him for the visit of @entity54			0
@entity31 understood , but was nevertheless frustrated			0
he felt starved of service in @entity49 ’s safety - first style			2
@entity31 has flourished under @entity2 and has scored nine in his last seven for @entity3 @entity2 addressed this immediately			1
during half - time in the @entity29 match against @entity62 – the day before his unveiling – he entered the dressing room and told his players to get the ball to @entity31 more often , and quicker			1
@entity3 scored two second half goals to progress			1
@entity31 has now got nine in his last seven for @entity3 , having scored three in 18 under @entity49 this season			2
there is variety , pace , and creativity in the final third and @entity3 have already surpassed under @entity2 the total goals managed with @entity49 at the helm this season : 16 goals in 10 games , compared to 15 in 28			1
the @entity41 international fires home the equaliser at @entity80 as he helped @entity3 conquer @entity81 trust in youth for around an hour after carrying out media duties on friday , @entity2 stood to watch @entity3 ’s under - 11s squad as they trained at @entity86			1
the man for whom youth development is so important was able to find time on the eve of his biggest managerial test to observe a crop of potential talents who will only be senior players many years down the line			0
that kind of commitment breeds belief across the training pitches			0
his faith in @entity102 is the biggest illustration of his philosophy , but he also handed @entity105 his debut as a substitute at @entity3 aged 16			2
since @entity2 ’s arrival , the under - 21s have been moved to train on pitches adjacent to the first - team and a number regularly join in with sessions when 11 v 11 , @entity114 and @entity115 among them			1
@entity102 was the star man against @entity118 ' side and has earned rave reviews under @entity120 @entity2 attended the @entity121 last wednesday to witness 22 - year - old @entity122 , on loan at @entity124 from @entity3 , score a brilliant free - kick			1
the night previous he was at @entity127 v @entity126 to possibly run the rule over @entity129 , also 22 , his under - 21 captain when at @entity130			2
such an approach is with eyes on building the club over the coming months and years but short - term it has served to bring renewed energy			2
the former @entity130 boss is keen on youth development and watched on - loan @entity122 score @entity139 delivering @entity139 signed his new contract at @entity3 before @entity2 arrived – it was actually announced on the big screens at @entity142 ahead of the @entity29 clash with @entity144 – but the 25 - year - old has since been handed key responsibilities			1
the @entity148 midfielder , described as @entity3 ’s @entity149 by @entity120 , was given the captain ’s armband permanently , taking over from @entity152 and leapfrogging deputy @entity153 , based on his mentality and exuberant grit in midfield			1
he has led by example , turning in performances that make him a certainty for @entity160			0
@entity139 is arguably @entity3 's most important player and he 's become a real leader under new management @entity2 has asked for more forward movement too , and offensive involvement			1
@entity139 ’s ability to drive past players – exhibited for both goals at @entity80 – was compared to @entity168 by @entity2 and the @entity170 - born player has responded to that acclaim			1
he has two goals under @entity120 after not finding the net once this season for @entity49			0
‘ when i came to the club @entity139 had just signed a new contract , he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four			0
he showed a lot of loyalty , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ i need characters like that , put themselves on the line			0
he can add goals to his game , he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score			0
he ’s nicked a couple for me already			0
i just want to encourage him to do that and then he ’ll be too expensive for anyone to buy			0
’ the @entity148 international scored the winner at @entity80 to send his side into the @entity195 in may sound staff moves @entity2 acted swiftly in the backroom department too , bringing in @entity198 as first - team coach , and @entity200 as performance analyst before his first official game in charge			1
he knows these guys from working at @entity130 and values their input			0
@entity206 , former goalkeeping coach at @entity130 , arrived in the days after the loss to @entity13 , curtailing a move to @entity209 to join up with a manager he respects greatly			0
@entity206 is a trusted friend and vocal presence on the touchline , the one who bear - hugged @entity2 from behind , lifting him off his feet , when @entity31 rolled in the stoppage time penalty to beat @entity216 in the @entity217			1
as assistant @entity2 made a smart move , offering @entity219 the chance to renew his @entity3 relationship			1
the 54 - year - old was the club ’s hugely successful reserve team boss and has developed younger players during a 17 - year association that ended during the early days of @entity49 's reign in june 2012			1
he was also caretaker manager after @entity228 left and nearly got the job permanently			0
‘ i wanted someone who knew the fabric of the club , ’ says @entity2			1
@entity206 ( left centre ) was one of many new staff members brought in to help save @entity3 from relegation @entity236 has also been into the dressing room to offer words of advice , although he is yet to formalise any coaching arrangement			2
training is sharp and intense , largely tailored to replicate matchdays and goal - scoring situations			0
inspiring confidence @entity2 said after the victory over @entity81 that the players believed they would win and the fans did too , suggesting many had already booked their hotels for the final on may 30			1
it is clear confidence is coursing through this @entity3 team now , the shackles not being so much thrown off as plunged to the bottom of the ocean to collect rust			2
the 46 - year - old has added a new found confidence to his sides game and is reaping the benefits @entity2 divides opinion with his outspoken comments but from within the club such positivity has spread to form a confident collective unit			1
' he sits and he chats to people			0
he treats people like men , ’ says @entity206			0
‘ the guys have responded to that – sitting them down , treating them with respect , letting them know when they ’re playing well , letting them know when they ’re not playing so well			0
‘ i look around , he ’s the manager and i believe what he tells me			0
i think the players believe what he tells them as well			0
he ’s a good leader			0
