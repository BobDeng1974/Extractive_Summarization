a @entity2 mole has sabotaged hundreds of raids against immigrants working illegally in @entity5 by leaking sensitive government documents to activists , it was claimed last night			1
small businesses suspected of illicitly employing foreigners were tipped off after a radical protest group was covertly handed the hit - list			1
the @entity12 launched a two - week crackdown – codenamed @entity14 – to target workplaces , including care homes , hotels and restaurants and construction sites that were believed to be employing illegal immigrants			1
crackdown : illegal workers were targeted but the @entity23 , a left - wing pressure group , said it had warned the companies to expect officials to bang on the door after being passed the paperwork by the mole , @entity22 claimed			1
the leak threatens to scupper the crackdown by allowing illegal workers to escape capture			0
the @entity23 said it was justified because the swoops were ‘ racially - profiled and unfair ’ – a claim the @entity12 said was ‘ abhorrent and completely without foundation			1
’ it said the raids were ‘ intelligence - led ’			2
activists said they had seen 225 pieces of operational intelligence in what they claimed was the biggest @entity12 leak in recent years			0
one document seen by @entity22 highlighted nationalities in specific industries who are being targeted			0
@entity49 mp @entity48 , chairman of the @entity50 , said he was concerned the document listed ' particular nationalities and races ' one entry described @entity55 working illegally in barber shops and another talked about laundries employing @entity59 nationals , described as ‘ not the best nationalities for us , but a new sector nonetheless ’			2
the documents reportedly said there were phone stalls in @entity66 which ‘ appear to have foreign nationals working on them , some of which do n’t speak fantastic @entity70 ’ , and there were ‘ nail bars with a @entity74 connection ’			0
yesterday morning , men waiting to be picked up in @entity76 , @entity77 , for cash - in - hand work on construction sites were arrested as part of the operation – suggesting the sabotage might not have worked			2
the @entity23 said the crackdown was ‘ a clear attempt to demonise migrant labour and satisfy the right - wing political agenda on immigration and the @entity88 ’			1
it claimed the operation had been launched in the wake of the electoral gains made by @entity91 in last month ’s council and @entity94 elections – a suggestion vehemently denied by the @entity12 , which said it had been planned some time ago			1
@entity49 mp @entity48 , chairman of the @entity50 , said he was concerned the document listed ‘ particular nationalities and races ’			0
@entity100 sources said the details were suspected of being leaked by one of the agencies it worked with to crack down on illegal workers			0
a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ i should like to be very clear that the @entity12 does not engage in racial profiling and any suggestion to this effect is both abhorrent and completely without foundation			0
’ he added : ‘ our enforcement activity , conducted in conjunction with other government agencies , is intelligence - led and targets sectors of the economy where illegal working is suspected			2
' we do not perform “ fishing expeditions ” and in the case of the current operation , we have worked carefully with employers who share the public ’s concerns about illegal working			0
