a father - of - two died from bowel cancer seven years after his gp failed to spot the signs of the disease			1
@entity5 died in 2012 , seven years after first visiting his doctor complaining of symptoms indicative of the early stages of bowel cancer			1
his wife @entity10 and two teenage children , @entity12 and @entity13 , have now been awarded a six - figure payout at the @entity15			1
despite mr @entity5 telling his gp his father had been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the age of 45 , he was not referred for further tests			2
those tests , medical experts say , would have detected a benign polyp - a growth in the bowel - and mr @entity5 would have made a full recovery			1
his diagnosis came six years after he first visited his gp complaining of the symptoms the 44 - year - old told his gp during his first visit that his father had died of the disease aged 45			1
but he was not referred for further tests , which medical experts say would have detected a benign polyp - a growth in the bowel - which later turned into the cancer , and saved his life the 44 - year - old , who was just 44 when he died in march 2012 , first visited the doctor in january 2005			1
but he was sent home having been told his symptoms were most likely just an anal fissure - a tear or cut which bleeds			0
the father - of - two , from @entity48 in @entity49 , was told to return if his symptoms became worse			0
six years later , in 2011 , the cancer was detected but by that stage mr @entity5 's condition was terminal			2
he died a few months later from carcinomatosis - cancer that has spread throughout the body			0
medical experts told a @entity15 hearing had mr @entity5 been investigated earlier , and treated for a benign polyp - growths on the lining of the bowel that can turn into cancer - he would have made a full recovery			1
the @entity15 awarded mr @entity5 's family a six - figure undisclosed sum after his gp , dr @entity62 admitted liability mr @entity66 , who approved the settlement , said it was ' in the best interests of the children and family as a whole '			1
he said he could see how much ' he meant to his family and how much they miss him and continue to miss him '			0
he told the court : ' the settlement of this claim is not the most important step for mrs @entity79 and @entity12 and @entity13 in coming to terms with that			0
' the conclusion of the claim will allow them to concentrate on more important things			0
' the undisclosed damages will be paid by the family 's former gp , dr @entity62 , who admitted negligence			1
solicitor @entity92 , for the family , said after the hearing that mr @entity5 's widow and children hope their experience will give other people ' who feels that their gp is not taking possible cancer symptoms seriously , the confidence to ask to be referred for a second opinion '			2
mr @entity92 added : ' sadly as medical negligence lawyers we see too many cases where cancer diagnoses are not made promptly and lives are lost needlessly			0
' dr @entity62 , of @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity48 , was represented by his medical defence union			2
dr @entity62 and partners at @entity113 and @entity114 told @entity115 : ' this was a tragic case for all those concerned and dr @entity62 and his @entity119 would like to express their sincere sympathy to all those that , not only loved mr @entity5 , but whose lives he has touched in some way			2
' although our aim is to always provide the best possible care to our patients , we know that occasionally things may not go as we had hoped			0
' this was the case with mr @entity5 and the consequences were devastating and life - changing for all those involved			0
' we will continue to strive to deliver a high standard of care and make any improvements necessary to achieve this			0
