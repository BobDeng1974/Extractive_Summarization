jail sentences of less than a year should be abolished unless there are exceptional circumstances , a @entity1 justice minister declared last night			1
@entity5 said there should be a legal presumption that no one goes to jail for less than 12 months , with criminals given community or suspended sentences instead			1
but figures show such a move would mean 60,000 fewer criminals going to prison every year , including thousands of violent thugs , burglars , sex attackers and robbers			1
@entity5 ( pictured ) said there should be a legal presumption that no one goes to jail for less than 12 months , with criminals given community or suspended sentences instead over time it would lead to the halving of the current prison population of nearly 85,000 , leaving tens of thousands of repeat criminals on the streets instead of behind bars			1
campaigners against soft justice pointed out that most of those given short prison terms had already been ‘ let off ’ with several non-custodial sentences			1
victims groups say short prison sentences are essential to give them some respite from those making their lives a misery			1
mr @entity5 set out his views in a speech to prison reform campaigners			2
he boasted in his speech about how his party had tamed the conservatives in government by reducing the use of remand – ensuring more offenders are free on bail ahead of their trial			0
he also said @entity1 had abolished the use of indeterminate prison sentences which allowed the most dangerous criminals to be locked up indefinitely because of the threat they posed to the public			1
and he said the @entity1 had blocked @entity63 plans to double the maximum prison sentence which could be handed down in a magistrates ’ court			2
mr @entity5 said : ‘ i believe that it is time for a statutory presumption against custodial sentences of under 12 months			2
' and , where a court decides that there is a justification for their use , they must have to set out the exceptional circumstances which warranted the sentence			1
’ mr @entity5 also challenged the @entity63 doctrine that ‘ prison works ’ , first set out by then @entity63 home secretary @entity80 ( pictured ) in 1993 ‘ instead , we need alternative , more effective ways to punish those who break the law in the community			1
’ he added : ‘ this is not about soft options			0
’ ‘ forcing someone to confront their behaviour – and , where appropriate , make amends to those directly affected by their offending – can be tougher than languishing in a prison cell for days on end			2
’ mr @entity5 also challenged the @entity63 doctrine that ‘ prison works ’ , first set out by then @entity63 home secretary @entity80 in 1993			2
since then , the prison population has increased from about 44,000 in the early 1990s to some 85,000 now			0
tories point out that in the same period crime levels in @entity102 have plummeted			0
an analysis of official sentencing figures carried out by the @entity105 shows what offences were committed by those who were jailed for less than a year over a five year period from 2009 to 2013			0
in 2013 , some 59,322 offenders were given a jail term of less than 12 months			0
over the five years from 2009 to 2013 that included a total of 2610 robbers , 8244 thieves , 12,572 violent thugs and 9252 burglars			0
it also included 1129 sex offenders convicted of assaults – the vast majority on women			0
some 6566 thugs caught with a knife would also have escaped jail , as would some stalkers , kidnappers , and drug traffickers			0
a @entity63 source said : ‘ going soft on crime is n’t the way to sort out re-offending			0
‘ letting criminals get away with not going to prison seems to be the @entity1 ’ latest wheeze which we do n’t for a moment think is what the vast majority of the public want to see			1
’ @entity141 , director of the @entity143 think tank said : ‘ it is incredibly rare for anyone to go to prison without first committing many , many serious offences			0
‘ sending far fewer of these serious , repeat offenders to prison would be an extremely dangerous experiment with public safety			2
’ ‘ the evidence is very clear			0
short prison sentences have high re-offending rates , but so do people on community sentences and suspended sentences			1
‘ so the only sensible way to cut short prison sentences is to give criminals longer sentences			1
it ’s once a criminal is in prison for two years or longer that we really see re-offending drop - and the public is completely protected in the mean time			0

@entity5 said sentences of less than a year should be abolished
@entity1 said short terms should be used in exceptional circumstances
criminals would receive community or suspended sentences instead
the move would mean 60,000 fewer criminals going to prison every year
