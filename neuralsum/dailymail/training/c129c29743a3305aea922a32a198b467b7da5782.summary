by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 15 july 2012 updated : 03:44 est , 16 july 2012 a trio of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 astronauts blasted off aboard a @entity7 capsule yesterday for a four - month mission to the @entity9			1
@entity3 cosmonaut @entity10 , @entity12 astronaut @entity11 and @entity4 astronaut @entity13 launched successfully from the @entity14 in @entity15 at 0240 @entity16 they are scheduled to berth early on tuesday , joining @entity12 flight engineer @entity18 and @entity3 cosmonauts @entity20 and @entity21 aboard the @entity9 we have lift off : the @entity24 rocket launches from the @entity14 in @entity15 yesterday morning carrying three astronauts nearly 250 miles above the @entity26 to the @entity9 ' the @entity7 had a very smooth ride into space , ' a spokesman for @entity12 said during a live broadcast on the agency 's television channel			1
the @entity24 rocket blazed a bright orange trail through cloudy skies above the @entity35 on the first stage of it 's journey to the @entity9 , a $ 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above @entity26			0
since the retirement of the space shuttles last year , the @entity5 is dependent on @entity3 to fly astronauts to the space station , costing the country $ 60million per person			1
@entity44 hopes a successful mission will help to restore confidence in its once - pioneering space programme after a string of launch mishaps last year , including the failure of a mission to return samples from the @entity53			1
the previous @entity7 launch on may 15 was delayed by more than a month after an accident during pressure tests damaged the @entity7 crew capsule			2
there were no such delays with sunday 's launch			0
expensive trip : the @entity5 is dependent on @entity3 's @entity24 rockets to carry personnel to the @entity9 since it scrapped its space shuttle programme last year ' the most tense , the most difficult part ( of the launch ) has been successfully implemented , ' said @entity67 , head of @entity68 @entity68			1
' i have just spoken to the crew			2
they are feeling great , ' @entity3 news agencies quoted @entity67 as saying in @entity14			2
' i have no doubts that all will go according to plan			0
' colonel @entity10 , a 50 - year - old cosmonaut on his fifth space voyage , loosened his straps about 20 minutes after blast - off after conducting air pressure checks			2
asked by @entity79 how the crew was feeling , he replied : ' good			0

they , along with @entity96 , are scheduled to return to @entity26 in mid-november			0
the previous crew of three at the @entity9 returned on july 1			0
cosmonaut @entity100 , @entity12 astronaut @entity101 and @entity102 astronaut @entity99 helped to dock the first privately owned spacecraft during a six - month stint in orbit			0
destination space : the @entity9 is a $ 100billion research complex orbiting 240 miles above @entity26 sunday 's launch took place less than three weeks after @entity112 's @entity111 spacecraft returned to @entity26 , ending a mission that put the country 's first woman in space			0
although @entity112 is far from catching up with the @entity5 and @entity3 , the @entity117 9 marked @entity112 's fourth manned space mission since 2003			1
it comes as budget restraints and shifting priorities have held back @entity5 manned space launches .			1
