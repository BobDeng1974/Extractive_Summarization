professor @entity2 was forced out of his role as the government ’s chief drug adviser in 2009 for saying ecstasy was less dangerous than horseriding			1
he now wants to study whether the hallucinogenic ingredient in magic mushrooms , psilocybin , can be used to treat severe depression			1
his team has been given a grant by the @entity22 for a pioneering trial on 60 sufferers who have failed to respond to two previous treatments			1
but he said he can not start because the @entity27 must first grant a licence for companies to supply his team with the compound			0
critics say professor @entity2 ’s track record makes him an inappropriate choice to carry out the research			2
previously , he opposed the decision to reclassify cannabis from @entity38 to @entity38 in 2009 , and has argued alcohol was ‘ considerably more dangerous ’ than the drug			0
last year , he led a controversial live trial of pure ecstasy on @entity43			0
@entity44 , of @entity45 , said of the latest project : ‘ why are the @entity22 giving money to a man who had got it completely wrong over cannabis ? professor @entity2 ’s patchy record raises questions			1
he seems obsessed with recreational drugs			0
’ magic mushrooms , with heroin and cocaine , are @entity58 drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users			2
previously professor @entity2 ’s team at @entity62 found psilocybin reduced activity in a part of the brain known to be over-active in depression			1
but that study was on healthy volunteers subject to less stringent regulations			0
only four hospitals in @entity72 have a licence to hold psilocybin , and professor @entity2 said the authorities refused to tell him where			2
he said : ‘ the rules are absurd			0
’ risk : magic mushrooms , with heroin and cocaine , are @entity58 drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users			0
