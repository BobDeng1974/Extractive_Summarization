by @entity0 the fiance of an architect who died trying to rescue him from their burning flat said she had a ' big heart ' and always put the ' lives of others before her own '			1
@entity7 , 23 , was coming home from a party in @entity10 when she noticed smoke pouring from the block of apartments			1
fearing her partner @entity14 , 28 , was trapped inside by the flames , she ran into the property in the @entity17 , @entity18 , in a bid to save him			1
heartbroken : @entity14 , said his fiance @entity7 , 23 , ' put the lives of others before her own '			1
she died running into her burning @entity18 flat , believing he was inside but mr @entity14 had escaped to the safety of the balcony and had to watch as paramedics battled to save his girlfriend , who had collapsed in the smoke			1
@entity28 - born miss @entity7 died from her burns in the @entity30 later that day			1
today mr @entity14 broke down in tears as he spoke outside @entity32			1
speaking after her inquest and clutching miss @entity7 's tearful mother @entity34 for support , he said : ' she was a person with a big heart			1
' she put the life of others before her own			0
unfortunately that is how people of her kind act			0
' but he was too overcome with emotion to say anything else			0
today , coroner @entity45 criticised a catalogue of fire safety failures at the apartment block , but ruled the 23 - year - old 's death was an accident			1
tragic : @entity28 - born miss @entity7 died from her burns in the @entity30 later that day after the fire at a property in the @entity17 she said the young architect was driven by love when she ran into the burning building in a ' understandable and very human ' bid to rescue her boyfriend			1
but she did what nobody but the fire brigade should do , and paid the price with her life , the coroner said			2
delivering her conclusions , ms @entity45 said : ' @entity7 's partner was trapped on the floor above and , @entity7 returning from a night out , saw the fire and realised what it was			1
' and in an effort to help him she did what nobody should do except the fire brigade , and entered a burning building			2
' she did so because she was desperate to try to effect a rescue			0
but her actions meant that it was she who had to be rescued , and led to the loss of her life			0
' it is very easy for us now to say @entity7 should never have gone into that building , and of course she never should have			2
' but that is a much easier thing to say after the event , and not in the moment when you are in a complete panic about your loved one			0
person with a big heart : the fatal blaze was sparked by a damp towel being left on a wall light in a fourth floor apartment at @entity98 ' just because it is something she should n't have done does n't mean to say it is not something very understandable and very human			0
' the fatal blaze was sparked by a damp towel being left on a wall light in a fourth floor flat at @entity98 on the @entity17 , east @entity18 , in the early hours of august 26 , 2012			2
ms @entity45 said the fire quickly spread because the apartment 's self - closing fire door was damaged and got stuck on the floor			0
in the confusion of the thick black smoke , miss @entity7 went to the fourth floor - the floor below her own flat on the fifth - where the fire was raging and was overcome by the powerful flames			1
she quickly fell unconscious and died in hospital later that day from her burns			0
the coroner hit out at a string of failures in the fire safety of the block of flats - which she said was partly to blame for the tragedy			1
selfless : outside @entity126 , mr @entity14 said : ' unfortunately , that is how people of her kind act '			1
he then was too overcome with emotion to continue speaking about the death of his fiance and she said miss @entity7 's death could have been avoided if the self - closing fire door was functioning as it should have been			2
she said she had ' considered very , very carefully the potential contribution to this sad story of the building itself and the procedures in place to deal with fire , ' she added : ' if the door to flat 101 had been shut the fire would have been very significantly contained until the fire brigade arrived			2
' and i think it would have allowed all the occupants to have made good their escape			0
' the fire brigade came quickly			0
the fire door was a good one and it would have kept the fire back			0
' safety : the coroner revealed there had been just one fire risk assessment carried out in 15 years at @entity98 in @entity158 , @entity18 the inquest heard claims the tenant had complained about the door , but it had not been fixed			2
and the smoke detectors were never tested by housing firm @entity164 , which own many of the properties in the block , and have only been tested once since the fire			0
just one fire risk assessment had been carried out in the 15 years from when the block was built in 1997 until the 2012 fire			0
and the inquest heard that a fire ventilation shaft that should have funnelled the smoke out of the building was too small			0
the coroner said the doors of the ventilation shaft did not open on the fourth floor , and the hallway had no windows and ' was not properly ventilated '			0
but she said these other safety failures did not contribute to miss @entity7 's death			1
couple : the coroner ruled there had been safety failings in the flat , but ruled the death as an accident she added : ' the one thing that would have made the world of difference , other than the fire not being started in the first place , is if the door to flat 101 ( where the fire broke out ) had been closed			1
' the coroner said she had considered making a prevention of future deaths report by writing to the authorities with recommendations for safety improvements			2
but she ruled this out because she could not think of a concrete recommendation she should make that would ' prevent a tragedy for the future '			0
turning to miss @entity7 's tearful loved ones sat in the court 's front row , she said she was ' so , so sorry ' for their loss .			2
