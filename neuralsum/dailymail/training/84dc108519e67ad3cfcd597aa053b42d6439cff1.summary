these figures come from the latest @entity7 ( @entity6 ) report which found that the overall spend in 2012 was in fact $ 5 billion less than a year earlier			1
while this may seem like a huge amount , the total for the year ( $ 359 billion ) is only just half of the $ 700 billion per year that the @entity14 claims is need to address climate change			1
the world invested almost a billion dollars a day to limit global warming last year , according to a recent study the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) claims that $ 5 trillion is required by 2020 for clean energy projects alone			1
‘ climate related investments have fallen well short of even the most conservative needs estimates for successive years , making the requirement of “ catch up ” very real , ’ said the report			0

by way of comparison , the same study estimated global renewables subsidies of $ 88 billion , including $ 20 - 22 billion for biofuels			0
last week @entity45 energy commissioner @entity44 was accused of attempting to conceal information on the full scale of the subsidies used for fossil fuels			0
however , 10 of @entity51 's biggest utilities are currently calling for cuts to renewable energy subsidies , arguing that they are driving up energy costs and distorting the power market			0
some 38 per cent of this year 's climate investment – $ 135 billion – came from the public sector , according to the @entity6 study			2

‘ although private investment has declined in general terms , technology costs for large - scale renewable energy have fallen further , perhaps as economies of scale start to take hold			0

report claims total of $ 359 billion is just a fraction of what is needed
