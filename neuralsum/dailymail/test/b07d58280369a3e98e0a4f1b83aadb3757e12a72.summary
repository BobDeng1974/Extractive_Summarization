a mother was left in shock after her four - year - old daughter discovered a four - foot snake in the bath - just a week after moving into the house			1
@entity6 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , was told by her daughter @entity9 that ' something was moving ' in the bath			1
and when the pair walked into the bathroom to check what was there , that 's when they came face to face with the reptile			1
the four - foot red and orange corn snake , which @entity6 discovered slithering around in the bathroom of her new home			1
she believes it may belong to the property 's previous tenant mrs @entity6 , a full - time mother , said : ' i thought she was joking , but @entity9 made me go and have a look , so i went and checked the bin and nothing was there			1
' but then i looked up and i was face - to - face with a snake			2
i nearly jumped out of my skin and slammed the door shut			0
' i even made sure our cat @entity36 was locked downstairs in case it tried to attack it			0
i had no idea at the time if it was dangerous or not			0
' panicking , ms @entity6 said she called the @entity43 , who were unable to help - so in desperation , posted an appeal on @entity47			1
within an hour , a local woman who keeps snakes had recognised her plight and identified the reptile as a corn snake , a non-venomous species normally kept as a pet			1
the woman then came to the house and took away the snake so ms @entity57 and @entity9 could get a good night 's sleep			2
ms @entity6 , 44 , added : ' it was a great response			2
obviously , they thought i was just joking at first but when i sent them a picture they posted it up online and i got some help straight away			0
@entity57 with her daughter @entity9 , who first spotted the snake in the bath before alerting her mother it is not clear how the snake ended up in the bathroom , but ms @entity6 believes that the previous tenant may have kept snakes as pets and lost the red and orange reptile while moving			1
she explained : ' we could n't think of another way it could have got into the house , but goodness knows where it had been for the week we lived there before he spotted it			0
' i was petrified at first and i was a bit nervoud about using the bathroom for the rest of the night			0
' but luckily we have n't found anything else yet ! ' but the encounter did n't faze four - year - old @entity9 , who said : ' when i saw the snake it was really still			2
' i was n't scared at all			0
i knew not to touch it			0
i 'm looking forward to telling me friends about it at school			0
