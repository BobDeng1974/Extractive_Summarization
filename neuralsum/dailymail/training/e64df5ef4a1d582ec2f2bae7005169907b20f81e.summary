barely a decade ago it was at the bottom of the heap			0
@entity3 had some of the worst exam results and truancy rates in the country and undercover filming shown on tv featured scenes of shocking behaviour – including a lesson descending into a riot			1
but now the @entity15 comprehensive has marked an extraordinary transformation after being hailed as one of @entity19 ’s best state schools by the high society magazine @entity21			1
@entity3 in @entity22 , pictured , is now one of the most successful state schools in @entity25 the school , pictured , has been turned around according to a survey by @entity21 magazine for the second year running , the magazine has produced a guide to state schools amid concerns that readers are finding it increasingly hard to afford private education			1
until 2014 , the magazine only produced a guide to the country ’s leading fee - paying schools , but now @entity21 sends out teams to find the ‘ very best of the state education system ’			1
@entity41 is among 22 state secondaries featured , taking its place alongside top - performing grammars and the girls ’ comprehensive chosen by former education secretary @entity46 for his daughter			1
@entity21 details how the school is now ‘ the big noise ’ around @entity22			1
five years ago , it says , a group of mothers banded together and presented the then head with a wish list which included @entity55 lessons and better music tuition			2
now the school is ‘ transformed ’ with a ‘ brilliant new head ’ who is keen on ‘ impeccable behaviour ’ and ‘ details ’ including top buttons being done up at all times			1
its music programme is backed by @entity66 , and offers every 11 to 14 - year - old free tuition on an instrument			0
it marks an astonishing turnaround for a school whose low point came in 2005 when @entity75 ’s dispatches sent an undercover teacher to film in classrooms as part of an investigation into education standards			0
the footage shows pupils clambering across desks , throwing books across the room , taking a fire extinguisher off the wall and attacking each other			0
a member of staff said at the time that they did n’t ‘ make a big thing ’ about enforcing rules			0
the school was founded in the 1960s under head @entity96 , who went on to become a @entity98 mp and education minister			1
then all - boys , it was conceived as a comprehensive that would serve as a ‘ grammar school for all ’			2
it thrived from the outset but by the 1980s , @entity96 had departed and a belief in progressive teaching methods had taken hold			0
in 1991 , inspectors highlighted bad behaviour and unsatisfactory lessons			0
former head @entity112 was credited with turning the school around , culminating in a 2010 @entity115 report which described it as ‘ outstandingly effective ’			2
‘ attainment has risen rapidly in recent years from a low starting point to close to the national average ’ , the report said , adding the transformation is ‘ remarkable ’			0
@entity21 notes that the institute is now attracting parents who would have previously shunned state education , meaning it now has a ‘ properly comprehensive ’ intake			1
as well as the music programme , there is ‘ an amazing gym , a swimming pool and good pitches and running tracks ’ , according to the complimentary write - up			0
meanwhile the school website now features a clear list of rules and sanctions for breaching them			0
other schools in the guide include @entity140 , a @entity141 comprehensive chosen by mr @entity46 for his daughter .			2

@entity21 has rated @entity3 as one of @entity25 **'s** best
the comprehensive school in @entity22 had been among the worst in @entity19
however , a ' brilliant new head ' has turned around the school **'s** *fortunes*
now it is being hailed as one of the best state schools in @entity25
