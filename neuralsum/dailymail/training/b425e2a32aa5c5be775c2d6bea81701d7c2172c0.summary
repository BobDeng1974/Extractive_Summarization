by @entity0 published : 14:23 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 14:35 est , 18 february 2013 a man has been jailed for life after stabbing his girlfriend to death in a ' brutal , vicious and sustained attack ' which was recorded in a terrifying voicemail message			1
@entity7 , 31 , admitted stabbing 39 - year - old @entity8 to death in a jealous rage following a night out in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the court sat in stunned silence as they heard a chilling voicemail message in which the mother - of - one pleaded for help just moments before she was brutally stabbed to death			1
@entity7 lied that girlfriend @entity8 stabbed him , even cutting his own neck to seem convincing @entity7 was sentenced to life imprisonment , with a minimum term of 17 and a half years , when he appeared in the dock at @entity22 on friday			1
judge @entity23 said : ' those close to her have been left with an un-fillable void			0
' no one who sat in this court this afternoon and listened to that recording can feel anything but shock and horror			0
' this was a brutal , vicious and sustained attack			2
' the couple had been enjoying a night out at @entity35 - a popular nightspot for star of @entity38 is @entity12 in @entity11 , @entity12 - on the night of the attack in july last year 2012			2
@entity7 launched into a jealous rage when the couple returned from the night out and he discovered a text message from miss @entity8 's gym instructor who he wrongly believed had been having an affair with her			1
the court heard a harrowing voicemail in which jealous @entity7 , who worked as an oil rigger , said : ' you 're the last love of my life			1
you was my last love			2
' miss @entity8 can be heard calling out to her nine - year - old daughter just moments before she suffered two fatal stab wounds to her back			0
the cynical killer had tried to claim his partner had attacked him with the knife - even cutting himself in the neck after the attack in a twisted bid for sympathy before placing the knife in her hand			1
but the damning voicemail message eventually forced @entity7 to confess to the killing when he appeared at @entity22 last month			1
@entity69 det chief insp @entity68 , from the @entity70 and @entity71 , said : ' the incredibly thorough investigation by my investigation team and the overwhelming evidence we gathered against mr @entity7 no doubt influenced his decision to enter a guilty plea			1
the couple had been on a night out at @entity35 in @entity12 on the night of the stabbing ' @entity7 was a controlling man with a violent temper			1
@entity8 was a woman who was full of life ; a loving mother , daughter and sister			0
@entity8 had been in relationship with mr @entity7 and she trusted him			1
he abused that trust and selfishly , through his own violent jealousy , took @entity8 's life away from her family			0
' @entity8 's family now have to face a future without her			0
i hope today 's sentence is some form of comfort to them			0
at least @entity7 is unable to hurt anyway else through his violence whilst he serves a life sentence for her murder			2
' @entity8 's mother , @entity101 , paid tribute to her daughter following sentencing , saying : ' @entity8 was a beautiful , kind person and anyone who came into contact with her could n't fail to be touched by her positive outlook to life			0
' the events of july 2012 have changed all our lives and we came today with no expectations other than to close this terrible chapter because nothing can ease our heartache or bring @entity8 back			0
' no sentence today can compare with the life sentence which was imposed on us last year and @entity8 will always be loved and never forgotten			0
' on behalf of my family i would like to thank @entity120 and @entity121 for all the help they have given us since this terrible event			0
" @entity126 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity127 , said : ' @entity7 viciously murdered @entity8 , a mother of one , in a jealous rage after mistakenly believing she was seeing someone else			2
' his guilty plea reflects the strength of the prosecution 's case , in particular a voicemail message that recorded his brutal crime			1
' the guilty plea meant that the family and friends of @entity8 did not have to go through a trial			0
' i hope that the sentence today will bring some comfort to them at this difficult time			0
' @entity7 was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years at @entity22			2
