by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:01 am on 16th august 2011 feeling the heat : president @entity3 wipes his brow as he takes questions on his bus tour @entity8 presidential hopeful @entity7 has attacked @entity3 , calling the president 's upcoming bus tour of @entity12 states a ' @entity13 '			1
the comment , which refers to the @entity16 iconic 1967 album ' @entity17 ' , is a continuation of the @entity8 frontrunner 's unrelenting attack on @entity3 - a strategy he has pursued at the expense of criticising his @entity8 rivals			1
the jibe came as @entity3 set off on a make - or - break bus tour in the @entity27 heartland today - where he hopes to re-engage with @entity27 voters			1
the tour could not come soon enough for the beleaguered president , who in a @entity33 poll today slumped to a record low approval rating of just 39 per cent			1
a statement released by the @entity7 camp said : ' during his @entity13 bus tour this week , it is unlikely president @entity3 will speak with unemployed @entity27 , to near - bankrupt business owners , or to families struggling to survive in this economy			1
' he is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class			0
' turning this economy around will require real leadership and the experience of someone who has actually worked in the private sector			0
' @entity3 had a further run - in with a @entity53 activist @entity52 , a leader of the group in @entity55 , who took the president on during an open - air town hall meeting			1
@entity52 sneered at @entity3 ’s calls for more civility in politics after claiming ‘ your vice president is calling people like me , a @entity53 member , a “ terrorist ”			1
’ @entity52 was referring to media reports that vice president @entity66 had made the remark at a private meeting on debt with @entity71 @entity70 earlier this month			0
@entity52 , right , clashed with the president at a town hall meeting in @entity55 , yesterday @entity3 responded : ‘ i absolutely agree that everybody needs to try to tone down the rhetoric			2
in fairness , since i have been called a socialist who was n’t born in this country , who is destroying @entity27 and taking away its freedoms because i passed a health care bill , i am all for lowering the rhetoric			0
’ the @entity27 president will make five stops on the three - state trip to @entity55 , @entity87 and @entity88 - in the first bus tour since he famously criss - crossed the country in 2008 seeking the presidency			2
the elaborate $ 1.1 million battle - bus - nicknamed @entity93 one - is the first of its kind to be bought by the @entity96			1
it comes after a summer spent fighting politicians in @entity99 over the nation 's debt crisis - and a day after two ' fast - rising ' republicans were mobbed at a fundraiser in @entity55 - where @entity3 will make his first stop			2
tour : the make - or - break tour comes as poll numbers indicated the president had slumped to an all - time - low of just 39 per cent talks : @entity3 meets six - year - old @entity110 outside the @entity112 cafe in @entity113 , @entity88 talks : @entity3 had lunch with five post- 9/11 @entity88 veterans at the @entity117 in @entity118 @entity119 around : @entity3 was pictured clutching a pie and mimicking telephone calls during his tour @entity3 will have the chance to absorb the public 's anger and do his best to give optimistic answers as he travels between town hall stops			1
and with unemployment standing above nine per cent , the country feeling the deep pinch of a stunted recovery and suffering the humiliation of a major debt agency lowering its credit rating , it seems he will have a lot to talk about			0
his aides have revealed he is unlikely to engage any of his potential @entity8 rivals by name			0
but , with his poll rating falling , he intends to draw sharp contrasts between his ideas on the economy and the @entity8 approach			0
the audience is rapt at the president delivers a speech at @entity149 's @entity148 in @entity118 , @entity88 on monday audience : @entity3 speaks during a town hall meeting , monday , aug. 15 , 2011 , at the @entity152 in @entity153 , @entity55 playtime : children from public schools in the town of @entity158 , @entity88 , help @entity3 get up after he sat down with them for a picture front runner : leading @entity8 presidential candidate @entity7 speaks during a campaign stop today he has dismissed that as little more than slashing spending on vital programs like education and @entity165 , the programme that provides health care for the poor			1
president @entity3 and the @entity70 will this week launch a counter-offensive branding @entity8 contenders ' @entity53 lackeys ' as his approval rating hits an all - time low			1
the president 's approval rating has dropped to below 40 per cent for the first time , according to @entity33 's daily tracking poll			2
the poll released last night said found 39 per cent of @entity27 approve mr @entity3 's performance , while 54 per cent disapprove			1
@entity70 have been trying to depict the @entity179 as right - wing zealots bent on destroying the @entity27 ' while protecting tax breaks for the wealthy and big oil while proposing to end @entity165 , slash @entity186 and pile additional burdens on the middle class might win plaudits with the @entity53 , it 's not remotely what the @entity27 people are looking for , ' @entity182 communications director @entity181 said			2
the trip is timed to dilute the buzz emanating from the @entity12 after @entity8 gathered in @entity55 over the weekend for a first test of the party 's @entity196 candidates			0
the state holds the nation 's first nominating test in the long road toward choosing @entity3 's opponent			1
sources also said that he was ready to hear complaints from disaffected @entity70 tired of his compromises with @entity8 , and from a public disgusted with a dysfunctional @entity99			0
the tour itinerary takes @entity3 through three states he won in 2008 , but where he now needs to shore up his standing			2
in @entity55 , he returns to a state that handed him a key victory over @entity182 rival @entity211 in 2008			0
but it is now where @entity8 have been blanketing the state in preparation for its first - in - the - nation caucuses			0
the first signal that their plan could be bearing fruition came last night when the two fastest - rising stars in the race for the 2012 @entity8 presidential nomination were mobbed by adoring republicans as they attended a fundraiser in the state			0
@entity226 , fresh off her win in a closely watched test vote in the long road to choosing @entity3 's opponent , portrayed herself as a mainstream midwesterner			1
newcomer @entity231 introduced himself as a common - sense executive focused on jobs			0
both candidates attended the same county dinner in northern @entity55 one day after the race was upended by @entity226 's victory in the @entity55 straw poll and @entity231 's announcement of his candidacy			0
and while both candidates have strong ties to the influential evangelical wing of the party and are popular with upstart tea party supporters , they told activists at the @entity249 @entity8 's @entity248 dinner in @entity250 that they have credibility on the party 's leading priority , jobs			0
poised : @entity3 listens to questions as he speaks at a town hall style meeting in @entity153 , @entity55 the @entity33 tracking poll since november 2009 has oscillated a great deal , but @entity3 's approval rating - in blue - has never dipped below 40 % until now protestors and supporters of @entity27 @entity8 presidential candidate @entity262 governor @entity231 greet him at a campaign stop in @entity55 @entity226 makes a bus side victory speech at the @entity265 in @entity266 , @entity55 mr @entity3 made a similar outing last year , travelling the @entity12 in a two - day , three - state tour in april 2010 that took him to @entity55 , @entity87 and @entity269			1
there was no bus , but the president 's motorcade made hours - long drives through rural areas , passing school children waving @entity27 flags and seniors sitting on lawn chairs			2
the trip gave him a chance to engage in some of the grass roots politicking he perfected in 2008 during weeks spent campaigning in the small towns that would help carry him to victory in places like @entity55 .			0
