@entity2 agents were envious of the glamorous treatment given to the real - lief tenacious operative who tracked @entity5 for the better part of a decade , it was revealed today			1
@entity8 starlet @entity7 plays the undercover analyst known as @entity10 , the woman who eventually finds the location of the then @entity14 leader			1
she is portrayed in a glamorous light – with wardrobes full of designer clothes and an enviable figure			0
but the real - life ‘ @entity10 ’ did n’t have it as easy as the @entity20 ; despite being one of the key people responsible for @entity5 ’s demise , @entity10 was passed over for a promotion			1
‘ it ’s an old - boy network , ’ he explained			2
‘ you do n’t know why people are promoted , why people are held back , and often people think the worst			0
’ @entity29 , a @entity2 officer whose identity was leaked , told the show that she admired the operative ’s moxy			1
‘ i ’d love to have a drink with her one day , ’ she said			0
the @entity48 ’s @entity47 told the ‘ today ’ show that the response from the @entity2 was not unusual , saying that operatives are often ‘ quite contrary , ’ the reality of @entity54 ’s battle against terrorism could n’t have been more different to the glamorized , politically - correct fiction of @entity57 , the hit tv show in which @entity59 plays a beautiful @entity2 agent who spots the @entity14 plot which her misguided male colleagues have missed			1
@entity2 supersleuth : a attractive young female @entity2 agent , played by @entity7 in the film @entity65 , spent the best part of a decade to finding @entity5 and became the @entity67 ' go - to expert on intelligence matters about their target the world ’s most dangerous terror group foiled by a killer blonde in @entity74 who wars with her superiors ? only in @entity8 ’s dreams , surely			1
but , astonishingly , it has now emerged that truth may indeed be as strange as fiction			0
according to @entity65 , a forthcoming film about the hunt for @entity5 — whose makers were given top - level access to those involved — he might never have been found if it had n’t been for an attractive young female @entity2 agent every bit as troublesome as @entity57 ’s @entity90			1
@entity2 insiders have confirmed claims by the film ’s director @entity93 that she is entirely justified in focusing on the role played by a junior female @entity2 analyst , named @entity10 in the film and played by @entity7			1
and just as in @entity57 , the real agent has been snubbed by superiors and fallen out with colleagues since the @entity5 raid in may last year			1
but who is this @entity2 supersleuth ? although the woman is still undercover and has never been identified , @entity65 ’s emphasis on @entity10 ’s importance tallies with the account of a @entity67 involved in the raid who later wrote about it in a book			1
@entity5 hunt : a very different side of the agent was seen days after @entity5 's body was brought back			1
she even started crying @entity117 writes in @entity117 of flying out to @entity118 before the raid with a @entity2 analyst he called ‘ @entity122 ’ who was ‘ wicked smart , kind of feisty ’ and liked to wear expensive high heels			1
she had devoted the best part of a decade to finding @entity5 and had become the @entity67 ’ go - to expert on intelligence matters about their target , he said			1
and while her colleagues were only 60 per cent sure their quarry was in the compound in @entity134 , she told the seal she was 100 per cent certain			2
‘ i ca n’t give her enough credit , i mean , she , in my opinion , she kind of teed up this whole thing , ’ @entity136 said later			0
the commando saw a very different side of her days later when they brought @entity5 ’s body back to their @entity118 hangar			1
having previously told @entity136 she did n’t want to see the body , ‘ @entity122 ’ stayed at the back of the crowd as they unzipped the terrorist ’s body bag			2
she ‘ looked pale and stressed ’ and started crying			0
‘ a couple of the @entity67 put their arms around her and walked her over to the edge of the group to look at the body , ’ wrote @entity136			0
‘ she did n’t say anything			0
with tears rolling down her cheeks , i could tell it was taking a while for @entity122 to process			0
she ’d spent half a decade tracking this man			2
and now there he was at her feet			0
’ @entity122 ’s role in the operation passed largely unremarked when @entity136 ’s book came out but now the new film — which is released in the @entity170 in january — has confirmed his estimation of her importance			0
although she remains active as a @entity2 analyst , it is believed @entity176 , @entity93 ’s screenwriter , was allowed to interview her at length			1
it has emerged that she is in her 30s and joined the @entity2 after leaving college and before the 9/11 attacks turned @entity54 security upside down			1
on target : the agent was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding @entity5 lay in @entity14 's courier network which led to his compound ( pictured is the attack scene in the movie ) according to the @entity48 , she worked in the @entity2 ’s station in @entity192 , @entity193 , as a ‘ targeter ’ , a role which involves finding people to recruit as spies or to obliterate in drone attacks			1
but @entity2 insiders say she worked almost solely on finding @entity5 for a decade			1
she was still in @entity193 when the hunt heated up after @entity201 became president in 2008 and ordered a renewed effort to find him			0
according to colleagues , the female agent was one of the first to advance the theory — apparently against the views of other @entity2 staff — that the key to finding @entity5 lay in @entity14 ’s courier network			1
the agency was convinced @entity5 , who never used the phone , managed to communicate with his disparate organisation without revealing his whereabouts by passing hand - delivered messages to trusted couriers			2
the agent spent years pursuing the courier angle , and it was a hunch that proved spectacularly correct when the @entity54 uncovered a courier known as @entity219 and tracked him back to a compound in the sleepy @entity193 town of @entity134			0
fiesty : @entity7 as agent @entity10 in @entity65 about the hunt for @entity5 it was a stunning success for the dedicated agent , though she hardly endeared herself to her colleagues in the process			1
as one might expect of a woman working in the largely male world of intelligence , colleagues stress she is no shrinking violet but a prickly workaholic with a reputation for clashing with anyone — even senior intelligence chiefs — who disagreed with her			0
‘ she ’s not @entity238 , but that ’s not going to find @entity5 , ’ a former colleague told the @entity48			2
another added : ‘ do you know how many @entity2 officers are jerks ? if that was a disqualifier , the whole @entity245 would be gone			2
’ in the film , @entity10 is portrayed as a loner who has a ‘ her - against - the - world ’ attitude and pummels superiors into submission by sheer force of will			0
@entity2 colleagues say the film ’s depiction of her is spot - on			1
if this is the case , then she shows little of the feminine tenderness that serves @entity90 so well in @entity57 and which @entity8 usually uses to soften female protagonists like @entity10			0
instead , the film shows her happily colluding in the torture by waterboarding of an @entity14 suspect			1
and @entity265 reported how she had told him she was n’t in favour of storming the @entity5 compound but preferred to ‘ just push the easy button and bomb it ’			2
given that the bombing option would almost certainly have killed the women and children the @entity2 knew were inside , her comment suggests a cold indifference to ‘ civilian ’ casualties			2
but then the real female agent is hardly your archetypal film heroine			2
she has reportedly been passed over for promotion since the @entity5 raid , perhaps adding to her sense of grievance			2
although she was among a handful of @entity2 staff rewarded over the operation with the @entity287 , the agency ’s highest honour , dozens of other colleagues were given lesser gongs			1
fellow staff say this prompted her anger to boil over : she hit ‘ reply all ’ to an email announcing the awards and added her own message which — according to one — effectively said : ‘ you guys tried to obstruct me			0
only i deserve the award			0
’ although colleagues say the intense attention she received from the film - makers has made many of them jealous , they are shocked she was passed over for promotion and merely given a cash bonus for her @entity5 triumph			1
glamorised fiction : the reality of @entity54 's battle against terrorism could n't have been more different to the politically - correct hit tv show homeland , in which @entity59 plays a beautiful @entity2 agent who spots the @entity14 plot which her misguided colleagues missed she has also been moved within the @entity2 , reassigned to a new counter-terrorism role			1
@entity93 , who won an @entity318 as director of the iraq war drama @entity320 , has said it was like being dealt a @entity322 at poker when she discovered a woman at the heart of the story			0
‘ the juicy thing about @entity10 was the surprise of it , ’ she said			0
one thing is certain : the emotional cost of her achievement took its toll on her			0
@entity136 recalls seeing her again as he and his comrades got on to a plane back to their main base at @entity338 in @entity118			0
she was sitting on the floor of the plane sobbing , ‘ hugging her legs to her chest in the fetal position ’			0
her eyes were ‘ puffy and she seemed to be staring into the distance ’			0
when he tried to reassure her that the mission had been a ‘ 100 per cent ’ success , she simply nodded and started crying again			0
he put it down to a mixture of exhaustion and relief for a woman who had , with almost messianic zeal , dedicated her life to hunting down the architect of 9/11			0

upcoming film ' @entity65 ' claims that @entity5 might not have been found if not for a young female @entity2 analyst
she devoted the best part of a decade to finding the terrorist
according to colleagues , she was one of the first to advance the theory that the key to finding @entity5 was in @entity14 's courier network
