an extraordinary letter from the nephew of @entity2 has been discovered in which he begs to be allowed to enlist in the @entity4 to fight against his uncle 's facist regime			1
@entity8 fled @entity9 when war broke out in 1939 to come and live with relatives in @entity12			1
after being rejected from the @entity4 because of his family connection , he wrote an emotional plea to president @entity15 in 1942 on why he so strongly wanted to fight for @entity16			1
one of the good guys : @entity2 's nephew @entity18 , pictured with his mother @entity19 , wrote to president @entity15 in 1942 begging to be allowed to fight for the @entity21 against his uncle 's regime fighting evil : @entity25 @entity8 , 34 , receives his papers before heading off to war against his uncle 's @entity9 forces in the letter , he wrote : ' i am the nephew and only descendant of the ill - famed @entity33 and @entity34 who today so despotically seeks to enslave the free and @entity36 peoples of the globe			1
' more than anything else i would like to see active combat as soon as possible and thereby be accepted by my friends and comrades as one of them in this great struggle for liberty			1
' the letter made its way into the hands of then fbi director @entity48 who approved @entity2 for service against the @entity50			2
@entity8 joined the @entity51 in 1944 but was removed from service three years later after being wounded			1
reign of terror : @entity2 salutes passing tanks during a military parade with high - ranking nazis @entity8 , who later changed his last name to @entity57 , was the son of @entity2 's half - brother @entity58 and first wife @entity59			1
he was born in @entity60 , @entity61 on march 12 , 1911			2
three years later , @entity58 left his wife and son and took off for @entity64			1
he remarried , becoming a bigamist , but kept in contact with his first wife			2
he settled in @entity9 asking @entity19 to send @entity18 for a visit			1
she agreed in 1929 when @entity18 was 18			0
@entity18 had a half - brother @entity69 - however he became a committed @entity9 ( and was later tortured to death by the @entity71 )			1
in 1933 , @entity18 found himself in @entity9 where he planned to cash in on his uncle 's rise to political fame			1
he badgered his uncle for a better job than the one he was given working in a bank			0
in 1938 , @entity2 offered his nephew a high - powered position within his organization but @entity18 fled to @entity81 , as he was suspicious that it was a trap			2
plea : @entity8 's letter begging to fight against the @entity50 was sent to president @entity15 ( left ) and appears in a book of correspondence from @entity21 wars he escaped from @entity9 in 1939 with the help of a @entity81 spy and quickly left for the @entity21 with his mother			1

the letter appears on the blog @entity103 after it was included in the book , @entity106 : @entity107 from @entity21 wars			0
the correspondence comes from varying conflicts - reaching as far back as the @entity111 to letters from @entity21 soldiers who fought in @entity114 in the 1990s			0

among the notes are the words of general @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
march 3rd , 1942.his excellency @entity15 , @entity127 of @entity128 , @entity129			1
@entity129 dear mr. president : may i take the liberty of encroaching on your valuable time and that of your staff at the @entity138 ? mindful of the critical days the nation is now passing through , i do so only because the prerogative of your high office alone can decide my difficult and singular situation			1
permit me to outline as briefly as possible the circumstances of my position , the solution of which i feel could so easily be achieved should you feel moved to give your kind intercession and decision			0
i am the nephew and only descendant of the ill - famed @entity33 and @entity34 who today so despotically seeks to enslave the free and @entity36 peoples of the globe			0
under your masterful leadership men of all creeds and nationalities are waging desperate war to determine , in the last analysis , whether they shall finally serve and live an ethical society under @entity158 or become enslaved by a devilish and pagan regime			2
everybody in the world today must answer to himself which cause they will serve			0
to free people of deep religious feeling there can be but one answer and one choice , that will sustain them always and to the bitter end			0
i am one of many , but i can render service to this great cause and i have a life to give that it may , with the help of all , triumph in the end			2
all my relatives and friends soon will be marching for freedom and decency under the @entity181			0
for this reason , mr. president , i am respectfully submitting this petition to you to enquire as to whether i may be allowed to join them in their struggle against tyranny and oppression ? at present this is denied me because when i fled the @entity192 in 1939 i was a @entity81 subject			1
i came to @entity21 with my @entity195 mother principally to rejoin my relatives here			0
at the same time i was offered a contract to write and lecture in the @entity21 , the pressure of which did not allow me the time to apply for admission under the quota			0
i had therefore , to come as a visitor			0
i have attempted to join the @entity81 forces , but my success as a lecturer made me probably one of the best attended political speakers , with police frequently having to control the crowds clamouring for admission in @entity211 , @entity212 and other cities			0
this elicited from @entity81 officials the rather negative invitation to carry on			0
the @entity81 are an insular people and while they are kind and courteous , it is my impression , rightly or wrongly , that they could not in the long run feel overly cordial or sympathetic towards an individual bearing the name i do			0
the great expense the @entity61 legal procedure demands in changing my name , is only a possible solution not within my financial means			2
at the same time i have not been successful in determining whether the @entity228 would facilitate my entrance into the armed forces			0
as things are at the present and lacking any official guidance , i find that to attempt to enlist as a nephew of @entity2 is something that requires a strange sort of courage that i am unable to muster , bereft as i am of any classification or official support from any quarter			0
as to my integrity , mr. president , i can only say that it is a matter of record and it compares somewhat to the foresighted spirit with which you , by every ingenuity known to statecraft , wrested from the @entity248 those weapons which are today the @entity251 's great defense in this crisis			1
i can also reflect that in a time of great complacency and ignorance i tried to do those things which as a @entity36 i knew to be right			2
as a fugitive from the @entity258 i warned @entity259 through the press that @entity2 would invade her that year			0
the people of @entity61 i warned by the same means that the so - called " solution " of @entity265 was a myth that would bring terrible consequences			0
on my arrival in @entity21 i at once informed the press that @entity2 would loose his frankenstein on civilization that year			0
although nobody paid any attention to what i said , i continued to lecture and write in @entity21			0
now the time for writing and talking has passed and i am mindful only of the great debt my mother and i owe to the @entity21			2
more than anything else i would like to see active combat as soon as possible and thereby be accepted by my friends and comrades as one of them in this great struggle for liberty			1
your favorable decision on my appeal alone would ensure that continued benevolent spirit on the part of the @entity21 people , which today i feel so much a part of			0
i most respectfully assure you , mr. president , that as in the past i would do my utmost in the future to be worthy of the great honour i am seeking through your kind aid , in the sure knowledge that my endeavors on behalf of the great principles of @entity299 will at least bear favourable comparison to the activities of many individuals who for so long have been unworthy of the fine privilege of calling themselves @entity21			1
may i therefore venture to hope , mr. president , that in the turmoil of this vast conflict you will not be moved to reject my appeal for reasons which i am in no way responsible ? for me today there could be no greater honour , mr. president , to have lived and to have been allowed to serve you , the deliverer of the @entity21 people from want , and no greater privelege then to have striven and had a small part in establishing the title you once will bear in posterity as the greatest emancipator of suffering mankind in political history			1
i would be most happy to give any additional information that might be required and i take the liberty of enclosing a circular containing details about myself			2
permit me , mr. president , to express my heartfelt good wishes for your future health and happiness , coupled with the hope that you may soon lead all men who believe in decencey everywhere onward and upward to a glorious victory			2
i am , very respectfully yours , @entity8			1
