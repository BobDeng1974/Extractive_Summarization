but the @entity7 is a hotbed for wacky vehicles - and the plywood car , designed by students at @entity12 in @entity13 , is a hot contender			1
it drew up on the starting grid alongside other eco-friendly vehicles in @entity18 today			2
the chassis of the car was constructed using a plywood and cardboard honeycomb composite - it was entered into a race this week the car was entered in the @entity7 2012 a team of students from @entity13 's @entity12 designed the wooden vehicle ' the car we are building will be entered into the ' urban concept ' category and will be powered by a @entity29 , ' says the team of students behind the vehicle			1
' as it 's an eco-marathon , we are trying to be as sustainable as possible in the entire design of the car - making the chassis out of cardboard and plywood and using bio-resin infused fibres for body panels			2
' the car was built by a team of undergraduate @entity43 students in @entity13 , @entity44			0
it has already won a design award in a competition against 200 design teams from 24 different universities			0
their innovative car , which runs on hydrogen , has a body made from cardboard sandwiched between plywood certified by the @entity55			1
its tyre covers are made from bio-resin , infused with hessian fibres , with the whole structure collapsible for easy delivery			2
the car entered the @entity7 2012 - the way to win is to design a vehicle that can travel as far as possible on a limited amount of fuel teams line up on the track for a group photo on day one of the @entity70 at @entity71 in @entity18 , wednesday , july 4 , 2012 other competitors in this year 's @entity73 include a streamlined vehicle that can do 584mpg			1
called the @entity75 – it was built by a team of engineers from the @entity79			0
it ’s powered by a modified @entity82 generator and can hit 25mph flat out			0
its low fuel consumption is partly achieved by coasting			0
slow and steady : @entity75 will get you far - but can only reach 25mph the power plant : @entity75 's engine is a modified @entity82 generator wheel - y clever : the @entity75 demonstrates that gas - guzzling is strictly necessary			0
