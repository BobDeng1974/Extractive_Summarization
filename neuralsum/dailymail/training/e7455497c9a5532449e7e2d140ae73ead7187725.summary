some friendships are just a bit more special than others			0
there is no doubt that the love between the @entity6 and her 25 - year - old mare @entity8 was tender , warm and utterly reciprocated			1
they had been inseparable for a quarter of a century			0
@entity10 , 77 , had raised @entity8 from a foal to adulthood			1
she had schooled her , groomed her , fed her , taught her to jump and petted , cuddled , nuzzled and mothered her			0
which is why , when @entity10 lay in hospital last week , beaten by cancer , she had three dying wishes			2
‘ she wanted to see her favourite horse @entity8 one last time , ’ says her daughter @entity28 , 33			1
‘ she loved that horse with everything she had			2
her other wishes were to see her dog @entity34 , whom she had owned for 13 years			1
‘ and to see me and my father speaking again , because we had n’t spoken for years			2
’ and so , as revealed in saturday ’s @entity39 , the brilliant staff at @entity38 welcomed @entity34 on to the foot of @entity10 ’s bed and set up a poignant equine farewell – arranging for @entity8 to be transported from @entity10 ’s farm in @entity44 , @entity45 , and then wheeling her bed out into the crisp november air for a last goodbye			1
no one who witnessed the moment remained dry - eyed			1
@entity10 , who could barely speak , whispered @entity8 ’s name and asked for a kiss			1
@entity8 gently nuzzled her mistress on the cheek with a soft velvety nose			1
@entity10 died hours later , early on tuesday morning			2
although terribly sad , it was also a wonderfully uplifting moment in a world often hobbled by ridiculous health and safety regulations and endless bureaucratic nonsenses			2
mrs @entity6 , who was passionate about horses and owned six others , pictured left in her prime			1
@entity8 stands alone , right the photograph of their final moments was circulated on @entity68 and @entity69 and immediately went viral			2
today , with @entity28 ’s blessing , we bring you another picture of @entity10 and @entity8 in happier times taking part in a show - jumping competition , and @entity28 and the glossy brown mare , pictured at the weekend , grieving but happy that @entity10 is at peace			1
@entity10 had always been an animal lover and owned six horses , three dogs and three cats at her death			2
‘ we always had animals around the house growing up			0
@entity83 loved animals and she even had her own riding school until she got married , ’ says @entity28			0
‘ she was so animal orientated , she loved them all , but horses were her pride and joy			0
’ the 77 - year - old 's dying wish was to see her horse of 25 - years one final time before she lost her cancer battle @entity97 , 33 , said that taking @entity8 to see her mother was very important and it was a ' beautiful moment ' horses were @entity10 ’s life			1
she worked at @entity102 from the age of 21 , first as race starter , then programme seller and later cleaning the parade ring			0
she had an exceptional eye for a champion , although she never gambled			0
according to all who knew her , she was kind , loving , hard - working , honest and caring			0
and terribly grateful to the staff of @entity38			0
‘ @entity111 and @entity34 was very important for my mum , ’ says @entity28			0
but even better , her third wish – that @entity28 and her father , @entity10 ’s ex-husband , would finally bury the hatchet – came true , too			0
on monday , the day before mum passed away , we put our differences aside and spoke for the first time in years			0
‘ so all her dying wishes were granted , ’ says @entity28			0
‘ i was there when she died and i know she died happy			0
’ and what of beautiful , gentle @entity8 ? ‘ she will stay with me now , ’ says @entity28			1
‘ @entity8 ’s still part of our family and having her will be like having a connection to mum			1
’ staff at @entity20 said they acted on the ' last wishes ' of dying @entity6 by arranging the final loving meeting with her horse			1

@entity6 said an *emotional* goodbye to her beloved horse @entity8
*dedicated* staff at @entity20 arranged the visit
the 77 - year - old grandmother lost her battle with cancer just hours later
pictures from family album show the pair together in their prime at shows
