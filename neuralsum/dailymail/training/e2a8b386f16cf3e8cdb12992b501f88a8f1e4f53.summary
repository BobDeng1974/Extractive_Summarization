by @entity0 most galaxies are thought to be large star - forming structures with millions or billions of stars			1
but the @entity5 dwarf galaxy , 75,000 light - years from @entity6 , has astrophysicists scratching their heads			1
it contains just a few hundred stars and it has n't produced any new ones in over 13 billion years , suggesting it may be a fossil left over from the young universe			1
the stars of the dwarf galaxy @entity16 1 , which may be one of the universe 's first galaxies , are circled here researchers led by @entity22 of the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity20 recently published their measurements			1
scientists believe the @entity27 gave rise to a universe filled with hydrogen , helium , and a trace			2
all the other elements that we see today were forged in stars , which are born in clouds of gas and dust provided by supernovae — huge stars that explode at the end of their life			0
this endless recycling process has yielded an intriguing tool for astrophysicists			0
one way of determining stellar age is iron , whose content in a star enriches with every successive birth			0
the lower the iron content in a star 's light spectrum , the older it is			0
they analysed data from the @entity60 ’s @entity59 in @entity61 and the @entity62 in @entity63			1
what they found was that the stars in @entity5 are made mostly of hydrogen and helium , with very little amounts of heavier elements like iron detected			1
this makes @entity16 1 ‘ the least chemically evolved galaxy known , ’ the researchers say in their paper			0
most galaxies go through periods of repeated star formation			2
when stars explode in supernovae , they release heavy elements that lead to the creation of new stars			2
the types of element released depends on the mass of the star			0
high - mass stars , which live for relatively short amounts of time , release elements like magnesium and calcium			0
low - mass stars , on the other hand , live longer but release mostly iron			0
now you see it : on the left is an image of the @entity5 dwarf galaxy as imaged with other stars , where it is almost invisible			1
when the other stars are removed ( right ) , the sparse galaxy starts to reveal itself the stars in the @entity5 galaxy only seem to contain products from high - mass stars			2
the researchers say this supports the idea ‘ that it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only one burst of star formation			1
’ the reason for this is not known			0
it may be due to something known as the ‘ epoch of reionisation ’ that occurred 13.2 billion years ago , 600 million years after the @entity27			1
in this period any existing galaxies would have lost their ability to make new stars			2
this would also explain why @entity5 experienced only one brief spurt of star formation			1
the new data on @entity5 was taken from observations made by the @entity60 in @entity61 ( pictured ) and the @entity62 in @entity63 another unknown is whether galaxies can form this small , or whether they form larger and then have mass taken away			1
‘ this study is so interesting because i really want to know , can galaxies form this small ? ’ astronomer @entity135 of @entity136 told @entity137			0
‘ can galaxies form and look like @entity5 when they form or do they have to form larger and then have some mass taken away ? ’ ‘ there could be 200 segue 1 - like galaxies around us			2
’ ‘ my lifelong goal is trying to understand , are things like this the most abundant in the universe ? ' for now @entity5 gives us a tantalising look at some of the first things to form in the universe			0
and it may provide us with some useful new information as to how some of the very first structures in the cosmos came to be .			0

small galaxy circling @entity161 could be a fossil from the early universe
dwarf galaxy @entity5 contains fewer heavy elements than any galaxy
this suggests it stopped forming stars over 13 billion years ago
this would make it one of the oldest galaxies we know of
the universe itself formed 13.8 billion years ago in the @entity27
observations were made using data from the @entity60 in @entity61 and the @entity62 in @entity63
' it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only one burst of star formation , ' say the researchers
