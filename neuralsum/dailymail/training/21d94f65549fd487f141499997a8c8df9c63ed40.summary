by @entity0 , @entity1 incessant rain in @entity3 washed out @entity6 's first @entity5 match against @entity7 on monday			1
@entity9 ' one - day international debut will therefore have to wait until wednesday in @entity10 , after a miserable forecast proved unerringly accurate			2
@entity6 captain @entity12 confirmed on the eve of the first of five fixtures that @entity9 is to be his new opening partner , with @entity17 dropping down to number three			0
waterlogged : incessant rain in @entity3 has forced the abandonment of @entity6 's first odi with @entity7 on monday boom ! @entity9 will have to wait to show his explosive form in @entity22 for @entity6 after game is abandoned but he never even got close to officially announcing his team as rain set in two hours before the scheduled 10.30am start at @entity27 and was still falling at 1.30pm			1
at that point , umpires @entity28 and @entity30 decided there was no prospect of even a minimum 20 - overs - per - side match taking place			2
@entity9 ' odi debut can therefore be pencilled in for the @entity37 this week , as @entity6 try to identify a formula for success against @entity7 and beyond - with next year 's @entity40 in @entity41 and @entity42 already very much in mind			0
downpour : the field had covers on but parts of the pitch became waterlogged and there was no hope of play shelter : fans wait and huddle under an umbrella as they hope for play to begin in @entity3			0

match abandoned at @entity3 following incessant rain on monday
@entity9 was *due* to make his odi for @entity6 but he will have to wait
new match in @entity5 takes place on wednesday in @entity10
*weather* *deemed* so *bad* even minimum 20 - over - per - side game not possible
