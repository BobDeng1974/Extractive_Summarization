its 6million festive ad was dubbed ' one of the greatest ever ' and became a social media sensation and it seems the popularity of the 90 - second clip has translated into sales success for @entity7			1
the department store group enjoyed an ‘ outstanding ’ festive period , smashing its december sales record			1
the ad that shows a boy impatiently waiting for @entity13 to give a present to his parents ends with the line ' for gifts you ca n't wait to give ' and certainly seems to have struck a chord with the @entity21 public			0
strong sales of clothes and electrical items helped the department store take more than £ 500million in the festive build - up			1
scroll down to watch the ad again the @entity7 advert cost £ 6million to make - but helped bring in almost £ 600million in pre-christmas sales the retail bellwether , which operates 35 stores , said sales were up 9.3 per cent to £ 596million in the five weeks to december 31 , up 9.3 per cent on last year and 6.2 per cent higher on a directly comparable basis			1
online revenues rose 28 per cent , boosted by a near doubling in the number of shoppers using its click and collect service , while like - for - like sales , which exclude new store openings , were up 6 per cent			1
the ad , which features a seven - year - old boy impatiently counting down the days until he can give his parents their present on christmas morning , became a social media sensation after its november launch			0
retail experts said the fantastic success of the ad , called @entity48 , contributed to @entity7 ’s remarkable sales figures which dramatically bucked the depressed trend elsewhere on the @entity51			1
in contrast @entity53 's refusal to follow the high street trend of huge pre-christmas discounts led to a drop in sales			1
the fashion chain admitted to a ' disappointing ' sales performance today for high street sales between august and @entity63 , triggering a slump in its share price			1
strong sales of clothes and electrical items helped department store @entity7 take more than £ 500million figures showed that sales at @entity53 were down 2.7 per cent on a year earlier , despite the previous year 's figures being hit by cold weather			1
but the group , which operates 520 stores , was cheered by the strength of internet trading , with a 16.9 per cent rise in its online and catalogue directory business			0
overall sales for the @entity53 brand were 3.1 per cent higher , in line with its guidance in november			1
although the final week before @entity13 was strong , overall sales in november and december were ' disappointing ' , as it refused to discount stock and maintained its profit margins			2
but more people left their shopping until after @entity13 when @entity53 put on a high profile sale , which it said ' went well '			1
next , which has been one of the best - performing stocks in the @entity94 over the past year , saw shares slump 5 per cent			0
rival @entity96 fell 2 per cent			0
the group narrowed its full - year profits guidance to £ 7million either side of £ 565 million , compared to £ 551million a year earlier			0

next up : fashion chain @entity53 is the first of a clutch of big name retailers to update the market on their @entity13 performances @entity7 ’s strongest sellers included @entity113 and @entity114 , cashmere sweaters and bedding and linen			1
the period saw it smash its previous weekly sales record , when it took £ 133.1 million in the seven days to december 17			2
however , it has seen a fall in sales in the week after @entity13 as it came up against strong comparisons with the year before when people rushed to buy big ticket items ahead of the hike in vat to 20 per cent			1
managing director @entity129 said : ' sales during the four weeks to @entity63 were outstanding			2
' @entity7 's pre-christmas sales were also flattered by softer figures from last year when the @entity134 weather kept shoppers at home			2
perfumes proved a popular gift ahead of @entity13 and accounted for half of all beauty sales in one week			2
the group said it sold enough @entity142 and @entity143 to fill 3,600 champagne glasses			0
@entity53 had enjoyed a strong year until the pre-christmas slump other popular gifts included lingerie , speciality chocolate and @entity149			1
sales of toys were strong , with a storage unit shaped like a giant @entity155 man 's head and @entity157 mini-robotic creatures among the favourites			2
baking gadgets and brightly coloured kitchen utensils such as cookie cutters , measures and cupcake cases and pudding bowls were also snapped up			0
and sales of boys ' and girls ' hats , gloves and scarves and snowboots benefited from the recent cold snap			2
its post-christmas sale has seen strong demand for laptops , tvs , @entity178 , @entity180 vacuum cleaners , @entity182 speakers and homewares such as mattresses and duvets			0
meanwhile , @entity186 , an analyst at @entity187 , said the weaker - than - expected performance from @entity53 may lead the @entity189 to downgrade its profits forecasts by 3 per cent			1
but @entity53 had some good news for consumers as it confirmed that it does not expect to hike prices over the coming year			1
the group last year openly passed on price rises , such as the soaring cost of cotton , to shoppers as it maintained its margins			0
it predicted that the squeeze on consumers will ease this year , with inflation dropping close to average wage growth			0
but it warned that the eurozone crisis and rising unemployment would continue to drag on confidence			0
the group said its stock levels at @entity13 were 10 per cent higher than a year ago , reflecting the weak festive trade			0
but the strong @entity210 sale , which saw consumers queuing outside stores across the country after many of its goods were reduced to half price or less , was expected to help shift the stock			0
it said : ' a number of factors have subdued sales in the final quarter and it is hard to judge to what extent warm winter weather and higher levels of competitor discounting masked the deeper , longer - lasting economic effects			2
' as a result , it was cautious about its performance over the coming year , but said it expected to generate £ 200million surplus cash to return to shareholders .			0
