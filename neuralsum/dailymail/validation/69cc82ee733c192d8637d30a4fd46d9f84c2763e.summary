in the history of human invention , there 's nothing that matches the car			0
we rely on them every day			0
to do our jobs , drop the kids off at school , or take an elderly relative shopping			0
cars mean freedom and independence , and most importantly of all , convenience			0
but years of crazy parking rules have made many law - abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses			1
we all know the story			0
you return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen			1
or maybe you run a local shop , and customers have dried up because what you sell costs less than the parking fee			2
local government and communities secretary @entity33 ( left ) and transport secretary @entity34 ( right ) have vowed to end the ' war on the motorist ' with their new ' common sense ' approach in 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end			1
that meant not only changing the rules , but changing attitudes , because under the previous @entity32 councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny , treating them like cash machines on wheels			1
this included spying on and filming drivers going about their daily lives			0
where if you made a mistake it would mean an expensive bill in the post			0
if you protested it could mean a doubling of the original fine , or an angry bailiff knocking on your door			0
and all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by @entity65			2
residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence			1
the minister says they want to see ' fairness and balance ' restored to the system so parking no longer generates profit these rules have now been changed during this parliament			2
local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines			1
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued			1
they have also vowed to end the industrial use of @entity93 ' spy cars ' to enforce on - street parking we are bringing back common sense			1
very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute ' grace periods ' for council - controlled parking , whether it 's on or off - street , paid or free			1
it means you wo n't get fined for being a few minutes late			0
we 're also ending the industrial use of @entity93 ' spy cars ' to enforce on - street parking			1
the new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post , but ensure public safety as @entity93 will still be used to protect schools , bus lanes and red routes			2
why have we done this ? because we want see fairness and balance restored to the system			0
as a result it will no longer possible to use parking to generate profit and we 're cracking down on the use of aggressive bailiffs			2
and in another victory for common sense parking at an out - of - order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay			1
there are also occasions where shoppers and drivers receive a fine and appeal because they genuinely believe they 've done nothing wrong			2
we 'll be trialling a new system so if this happens to you , you 'll receive a 25 % discount even if the appeal is lost			0
these changes are great news for drivers but they are good news for town centres and business too			0
people supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce			1
under the previous administration life became unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring			0
we 're ending this pointless war on motorists so that you do n't feel like a criminal just for parking your car .			2
