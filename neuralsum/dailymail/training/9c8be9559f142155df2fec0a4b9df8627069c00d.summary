the fight , which would be worth at least $ 300million ( Â£ 197million ) , is expected to be held at the @entity5 in @entity6 with a preferred date of may 2			1
@entity0 has consistently called out @entity8 since his lop - sided win over @entity10 last november			1
@entity0 believes his long - awaited fight with @entity2 will be announced before february and he told the @entity12 : ' we will make an announcement before the end if the month			1
i think it will happen			0
' @entity8 wants to fight on may 2 , the saturday closest to the @entity19 holiday , as has been his tradition in recent years			1
but that date has also been earmarked for @entity23 's proposed clash with @entity24 which would be one of the biggest fights in the history of the @entity30 - @entity29 rivalry			1
@entity8 said last month : ' the public want this fight			1
the only stumbling block has been @entity35 ( @entity0 's promoter ) but i think both fighters want it			1
so it 's time to get it on			0
i 'm not ducking anyone , so let 's get this on			0
@entity2 has blamed the long delay for the fight on @entity0 's promoter @entity35 ( above ) ' years ago we had problems with random blood and urine testing			1
i just want to have an even playing field			0
' now he 's in a very , very tight situation with his loss to ( @entity53 and his loss to ( @entity56 ) @entity55			0
his pay - per - view numbers are extremely low , so he 's desperate			1
i wanted that fight a long time ago			2
' reports in @entity60 over the weekend suggested the venue had been agreed , as well as a drug testing programme			0
the final stumbling block appears to be the purse split with @entity8 refusing to agree to a 50/50 division			1
@entity2 is keen to fight on may 2 as it is the saturday closest to the @entity19 holiday but @entity0 has long been adamant that he would accept the smaller portion in order to end more than five years of debate since the fight was first mooted			1

i challenged him to a charity fight			2
until now , he has not agreed to it			0

this fight is about legacy , this is about making the fans happy and , above all , this is for the good of boxing			2
' he has reached a dead end			0
he has nowhere to run but to fight me			2
i will try my best to make this a thrilling and entertaining fight			2
but i doubt if he 's gon na engage me in a slugfest			0
you all know his fighting style			0
most of his previous fights , if not all , induced us to sleep			0
' i know what i have to do			0
i will chase him wherever he goes just in case he decides to run around the ring			0
we will devise a good fight plan against him			0
