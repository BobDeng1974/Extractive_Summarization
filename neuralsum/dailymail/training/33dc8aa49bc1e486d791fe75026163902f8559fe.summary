by @entity0 published : 12:01 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 13:23 est , 10 december 2012 a girl whose organs were slowly being crushed under their own weight because of a spinal defect has been saved - after doctors amputated her legs and inserted the bones into her back			1
@entity9 , five , was born with a massive gap in her spine , and her legs were folded up under the back of her thighs			1
the missing segment meant @entity9 's body did not have enough support and she may have died from organ failure			1
she now faces a brighter future after surgeons amputated her lower legs and supported her reconstituted spine @entity9 's mother said the young girl had never considered herself to be disabled , and would always find away around obstacles but doctors at @entity29 saved her life after coming up with a radical solution - amputate her lower legs , which had very little feeling in them , and use the bone to forge the gap in her spine			1
@entity9 , from @entity36 in the @entity37 , became the first child in the @entity39 and only the second person in the world to undergo the pioneering surgery last month and is now recovering well			1
her mother , @entity43 , could not be more proud of her			0
she said : ' @entity9 has never considered herself as disabled			2
she decides what she wants to do , and finds a way to do it , overcoming any obstacle			0
' she has always been very active enjoying dance , sport and playing with others			0
she is an exceptionally bright young girl who is above average academically			0
' @entity9 is the only person in the @entity39 to have the extremely rare spinal condition , spinal segmental dysgenesis of the lumbar spine , where the lower segment of her spine is missing			1
earlier attempts to straighten her legs had been unsuccessful , leading doctors to consider the risky surgery			0
@entity9 with big sister @entity60			2
her mother said she would one day like @entity60 to teach her how to walk pioneering : @entity9 received a bone graft from one of her amputated legs			1
metal scaffolding was then implanted to support the spine during the complex operation by a team of seven , @entity9 ’s lower legs were amputated where she had little or no feeling , and bone was taken from one of her legs and grafted to the base of her spine			1
two 15cm long rods were screwed in place – carefully avoiding the nerves – to create a type of ' scaffolding ' from the upper part of her spine down to the hip bone			2
the operation took a grueling 13 hours			0
before the operation @entity9 did have some feeling in her lower body			1
at eight months old she was able to move herself around adopting a commando style crawl suggesting that her spine and nerves were working after all			0
now , after the operation @entity9 already has more sensation in the upper part of her legs			1
it is a huge development and opens up the possibility that @entity9 may one day walk using prosthetic limbs			2
ms @entity43 said : ' the only thing that @entity9 has been unable to do is walk , which is her ultimate goal in life			2
after her operation and with the correct support we ’re confident now that she will be able to find a way to do that - to some degree			2
' she loves her older sister @entity60 dearly , and has always aspired to be like her			0
she always says she would like to walk like @entity60 one day and that @entity60 would teach her			0
' mr @entity105 , who was one of the three operating surgeons , said the team were very pleased with the results the family on the way home from a check - up at @entity29			0
they are looking forward to their first worry - free @entity114 both she and @entity9 's father @entity116 , thanked staff at @entity29			1
' i know from talking to the surgeons that there were some very tough decisions that needed to be made as the surgery progressed , and i am grateful for their ability to work through difficult circumstances to give our daughter the best chance of reaching her full potential , ' ms @entity43 said			0
consultant neurosurgeon mr @entity105 from @entity29 , who was one of the three surgeons to operate on @entity9 , said : ' we are delighted with the results of this operation			2
this is only the second time in the world that a surgical team has attempted to fix the thoracic spine to the hip side bones for a condition as rare as @entity9 ’s			1
' this case was very complicated as normally children with this condition do not have a working spinal cord or nerves but @entity9 did			0
so in carrying out this procedure we had to be extremely careful not to damage her nerves			0

@entity9 was born with a gap in her spine that left her body lacking support
the five - year - old 's lower legs were also folded under her in rare *disorder*
she then had her lower legs amputed and the bone inserted into her spine
