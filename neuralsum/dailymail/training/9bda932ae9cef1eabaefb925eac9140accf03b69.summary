by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 took almost as much pride in his maiden test half - century as the two wickets in two balls that kept @entity6 in the second test			1
@entity2 , who was dismissed off the last ball of the day at @entity9 when he first acted as nightwatchman against @entity11 , this time showed the batting style which marks him out as bowling all - rounder material			1
‘ i take pride in my batting , i love to bat , ’ said @entity2 , who volunteered to go in ahead of @entity15 on friday night with the new ball imminent			2
‘ i started out as a batsman at junior level and i still work hard at it			2
resistance : @entity2 scored his maiden @entity24 at @entity25 during @entity6 's second test against @entity27 boost : @entity6 's @entity2 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity29 during @entity27 's second innings glory : @entity2 runs off to celebrate the wicket of @entity33 , his second in just two balls against @entity27 at @entity25 ‘ last night i was trying to line it up and was prepared to take one on the body if necessary but then i had the freedom to play my shots			1
it ’s great to get a 50			2
‘ i ’m absolutely over the moon with it			0
‘ i ’ve been working hard to be honest with you			0
i ’ve felt good with the bat all year and i ’ve been working on some stuff			0
last night when i came in as nightwatchman i worked really hard on lining it up and i felt in good nick and then came out in the morning a little bit more confident			0
’ @entity2 , who has been used mainly as an enforcer in his second coming for @entity6 , admitted that he got it wrong in the first innings when he was culpable as @entity27 scored at least a hundred more than they should have on a green pitch			1
expansive : @entity2 started his junior career as a batsman and has the potential to be an @entity6 all - rounder high point : @entity6 celebrate after @entity2 dismissed @entity33 to take his second wicket in two balls ‘ i ’m an aggressive bowler and that ’s how i got back in the team and i did n’t want to take that away from myself because if i did , i ’d just bowl little swingers , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ but i got my lengths wrong in the first innings			0
i adjusted second time around and bowled a lot better			0
’ but @entity2 regretted wasting saturday afternoon ’s opportunity to claim a hat - trick - his third such chance in @entity70 this season			1
‘ i guess the lesson is not to bowl a wide one like that , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ i was just trying to be aggressive but i got my line wrong			0
’ @entity2 was a member of the @entity76 attack who conceded 472 in the final innings to a @entity80 - inspired @entity79 as they lost a remarkable championship game at @entity83 ’s this season			1
lift : @entity2 took two wickets in two balls to keep @entity6 in the hunt for a win on day three of the second test salute : @entity2 acknowledges the crowd during his unbeaten 55 , which he said he was ' over the moon ' with he was adamant on saturday night that this pitch will get better for batting as the @entity70 continues			1
‘ it ’s still nipping around but if you get in there are runs to be had , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ we are willing to chase whatever we need to on this wicket			0
‘ we ’ll come out hard again			0
if we get a few early ones it ’s still a good pitch and still a good cricket wicket			0
the wicket ’s only going to get better so we ’ll go hard in the morning and see what happens			0
’ @entity29 , the first of @entity2 ’s victims in those two balls , said @entity27 were aiming for a 350 lead but would still fancy their chances if they could set @entity6 300 to win			1
‘ the bounce is very uneven , a couple are keeping low and others are kicking , ’ said @entity29 , in a rather different assessment of the third - day pitch to that offered by @entity2			1
‘ if we bowl well i ’m confident we could defend any total			0
’ in truth , anything more than 250 will seriously test an @entity6 side who have forgotten how to win and a nervous chase is in prospect for @entity126 and @entity6 over the final two days of this @entity24			2
pumped : @entity2 celebrates the wicket of @entity29 as he put @entity6 in a good position after day three at @entity25 shot : @entity2 's unbeaten 55 helped @entity6 to a total of 319 and they trail @entity27 by 145 heading into day four			1

@entity2 scored 55 not out during @entity6 's first innings , his first test 50
he used to be a batsman when he was a junior and has all - rounder potential
the @entity6 *paceman* also took two @entity139 wickets in two balls
he claimed the wickets of @entity29 and @entity33 on day three
@entity2 regretted bowling wide delivery when he had chance of a hat - trick
@entity27 ended day three of the second test at @entity25 on *169* - 4 , a lead of 145
@entity6 were bowled out for 319 to lead by 24 after first innings at @entity25
