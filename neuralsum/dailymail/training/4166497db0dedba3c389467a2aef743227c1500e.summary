a new @entity10 campaign claims that if the average family replaces fizzy drinks with sugar - free alternatives , it will cut sugar consumption by three quarters of a bag in just a month			1
and drinking semi-skimmed instead of whole milk can reduce fat intake by the equivalent of a third of a pint			1
campaign : @entity23 is issuing new adverts to urge families to switch to healthier food and drink the @entity29 ' campaign , launched to coincide with the start of 2014 , also encourages people to use low - fat alternatives to cheese and butter			1
breakfast cereal is another target of the initiative , with families urged to cut out sugary treats in the morning and replace them with healthier options			2

' swapping like - for - like food in our diet could help cut out surprising levels of saturated fat , sugar and ultimately calories without having to give up the kinds of food we like , ' said professor @entity58 , director of health and wellbeing at @entity41			1
' we all eat too much saturated fat and sugar which can increase our calorie intake			0
together this increases our risk of obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and some cancers			0
shocking : this ad shows how much sugar is in every can and bottle of fizzy drink ' we 're committed to doing as much as possible to support families to make these swaps , which is why i 'm pleased to announce that hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of offers will be available to those who sign up to @entity29 and in store across hundreds of shops in @entity41			2
' public health minister @entity82 added : ' we know how difficult it can be to make big changes to your diet which is why this new @entity23 campaign suggests small changes as a step in the right direction			0
' with over 60 per cent of adults and a third of 10 - and 11 - year - olds overweight or obese , it is really important that we keep helping people make better choices about their diet			0
' however , the fizzy drinks industry has criticised the new campaign , claiming it gives a ' deliberately negative ' and distorted picture of their products			0
' we are disappointed that for the second year in succession this campaign heavily targets soft drinks which provide just two per cent of the calories in the average adult diet in the @entity107 , ' said @entity108 of the @entity107 @entity109			0
