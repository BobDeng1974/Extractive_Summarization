by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 8 march 2013 updated : 13:24 est , 8 march 2013 former @entity2 army officer @entity1 has been jailed for 12 months for defrauding the taxpayers out of nearly £ 200,000 an army officer who defrauded taxpayers of nearly £ 200,000 to educate his children at a top private school was jailed for 12 months today			1
lieutenant colonel @entity8 , 53 , claimed the cash from the @entity11 's continuing education allowance ( @entity12 ) to send his three sons to the exclusive £ 28,000 - per - year @entity15 @entity14 in @entity16			1
the @entity12 financially helps service personnel to send their children to boarding school to prevent disruption to schooling caused by postings around the @entity2 and abroad			1
but @entity23 , who is known as @entity25 , had actually separated from his wife @entity26 but told his superiors they were still together and she lived with him in his @entity11 quarters so he could claim the money			1
his ruse was only rumbled when his now ex-wife rang his superior officer in the summer of 2009 and asked ' where 's @entity25 ? ' , sparking an investigation			2
jailing him at @entity37 today , recorder @entity35 told @entity23 he had committed a ' serious , substantial fraud ' over five years between 2004 and 2009			1
' this is not just a case of letting things slip , ' the judge said			0
' on each of these occasions you deliberately ... made declarations to obtain the money you obtained and make the fraud			2
' he added : ' you are an intelligent man and knew what you were doing			0
' @entity23 sent sons @entity51 , 22 , @entity53 , 20 , and his youngest , aged 15 , to @entity14 - motto @entity54 ( as much as i can ) - using the @entity11 's continuing education allowance ( @entity12 )			1
the officer , of @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity16 , used the ' eye - watering ' sums of money - totalling £ 188,060.11 - to provide a privileged education for five years that he could not have otherwise afforded , his trial heard			1
as the @entity11 investigation began , @entity23 realised the ' balloon had gone up ' and he set about trying cover his tracks by changing his personal status			1
the court heard that @entity23 was legitimately claiming the allowance , which pays up to 90 per cent of the school fees , until he separated from his wife			1
he was accused of not informing his superiors of the split - therefore creating a change in his personal status - meaning he may have no longer have received the allowance			1
@entity23 claimed money from the @entity11 's continuing education allowance ( @entity12 ) , which is used to prevent disruption to service personnel 's schooling , to send his three sons to @entity14 , pictured , despite having separated from his wife @entity1 was convicted of three charges of obtaining a money transfer by deception , three charges of fraud and one charge of the forgery of his ex-wife 's signature on a bank form , after a trial in january			1
@entity95 , representing @entity96 , said his client , who has retired from the @entity11 on a pension equivalent to a ' modest salary ' , had a distinguished career as an educator serving in @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			1
the latter of these three had seen him catch an infection which had led to degenerative kidney disease , he added			0
@entity23 had not pre-planned the fraud , having started off claiming the money honestly , mr @entity95 said			2
' it is plain that mr @entity1 had everybody 's model of a happy life , ' he said			0
' he was married , had stability and he and his wife had three children together			2
' slowly and painfully all that came to an end from 2002 to 2009			0
there may be a number of factors that caused him to act as he did			0
' you may feel he was too proud , or too blinkered or too stubborn or too embarrassed about the change fate had wrought on his life to do his duty			0
' it may have been a combination of these factors			0
had he told the army the right information at the right time none of us would be here and his three sons would have been educated in the same way at the same school with the same benefits			0
' the fault for that lies squarely at his door			0
' but the judge said he had seen no evidence that @entity23 would have been legitimately entitled to the money			0
he accused him of ' dithering ' while giving evidence in his trial ' in an attempt to hide your dishonesty '			0
he also attacked him for trying to block his wife 's access to a joint bank account by forging her signature			2
' it 's clear you were a good carer for your children , ' he told the bespectacled defendant			2
' ( but ) you treated the rights of your then wife with what i regard as contempt			0
' according to the @entity166 the @entity12 is available to all ranks , not just officers			2
service personnel can claim up to £ 6,074 per child per term but must pay at least 10 per cent of the school fees themselves			1
the @entity166 announced changes to the rules in december 2010 with the aim of saving more than £ 20 million per year			0
the @entity11 will be seeking to recoup the money it paid out .			1
