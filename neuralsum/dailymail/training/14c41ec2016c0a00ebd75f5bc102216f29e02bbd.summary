the company has agreed to rebrand its ' eco superstar ' a major lightbulb producer has given way and agreed to stop branding old - fashioned products as ‘ eco ’ bulbs			1
the @entity6 revealed last month that @entity7 and @entity8 , two of the biggest manufacturers of lightbulbs , were selling basic halogen bulbs with ‘ eco ’ branding			1
consumer groups accused the firms of trying to ‘ greenwash ’ their products , encouraging people to buy them because they think they are more environmentally friendly and could save them money			2
but in reality halogen bulbs are among the least energy efficient bulbs widely available today			1
they have been surpassed by several technologies including leds and compact fluorescent ( @entity28 ) bulbs - some of which will burn ten times less energy			1
now , just weeks after the @entity6 ’s expose , @entity7 has agreed to rebrand its ‘ @entity33 ’ bulb as ‘ @entity34 ’			1
@entity35 , a spokesman for the @entity37 - based firm said : ‘ we have decided not to use the term ‘ @entity33 ’ for our halogen products any more			1
‘ this change will be implemented in the course of an already planned packaging change			0
‘ the advantages of dedicated lamp types will still be communicated in the future			0
this includes longer lifetime , the possibility of disposal in household waste and better light quality			0
the adjustment will be implemented as soon as possible			0
’ previously @entity7 had tried to insist that @entity54 stood for ‘ economy ’ as well as ‘ ecology ’ - reflecting the cheaper price of the halogen bulb			1
but the firm has now changed its stance			0
mr @entity35 said : ‘ from our point of view , the term ‘ @entity33 ’ is not crucial for our customers			2
‘ for this reason we decided not to use it anymore			0
’ @entity8 , however , is continuing to sell its @entity68 bulb			0
a spokesman said consumers are given enough information on packets to make an informed decision			0
the @entity74 estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with @entity25 will save a family £ 40 a year in electricity bills			2
@entity68 bulb and @entity80 bulb each only earn an energy label grade of c or @entity83 , the third and fourth out of five efficiency bands			2
the @entity74 estimates that replacing every halogen bulb with @entity25 will save a family £ 40 a year in electricity bills			2
they will last just 2000 hours and consume ten times more energy than the latest led technology , researchers say			0
@entity91 , director of the @entity92 , a think tank in @entity93 , said : ‘ low - energy lightbulbs are one of the success stories of recent years , saving @entity98 households about a billion pounds per year and helping to reduce the carbon emissions that are changing our climate			0
‘ so it ’s great that @entity7 has seen sense and put consumers back in charge of their energy saving			1
we would urge other companies still using misleading labels to follow suit and help consumers make informed choices about their energy bills and carbon emissions			1

@entity6 revealed companies were selling halogen bulbs with ' eco ' labels
weeks after the expose @entity7 is to rebrand their ' @entity33 ' bulbs
the products will now be sold as ' @entity34 ' after *criticism*
@entity34 bulbs are among the least energy efficient on the *market*
