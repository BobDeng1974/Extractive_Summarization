' you took your details and cash to hand them to the man you now know as @entity1			1
' whether you were approached or you approached them , it is clear you were joining yourself to an ongoing and widespread crime and lining the pockets of a corrupt court official and a middle man			0
' you thought what you was doing was easy and cheap at the price			0
that must be seen as wrong			0
' it is my duty to deter other people from joining in this type of scheme and this type of offending			0
