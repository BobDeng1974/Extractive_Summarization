president @entity0 is seeking an increase in taxes on the wealthiest @entity3 by raising the capital gains rate and eliminating a tax break on inheritances , then using the revenue to fund new tax credits and other cost - saving measures for the middle class			1
the president 's proposals are to be announced during tuesday 's @entity14 address			1
they are likely to be cheered by @entity16 and considered non-starters with the new @entity19 majority on @entity20			0
the proposal 's centerpiece is an increase in the capital gains rate , to 28 percent , on couples making more than $ 500,000 per year			0
the tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20 % for the highest - earning @entity3			0
@entity0 will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so - called " trust fund " loophole the @entity30 says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year			2
the administration â€™s proposal would exempt the first $ 200,000 in capital gains per couple plus $ 500,000 for a home , along with all personal property except for valuable art and collectibles			0
the rest would be treated for income - tax purposes as if it had been sold			0
going up : the centerpiece of the president 's tax proposal is an increase in the capital gains and dividends rate on couples making more than $ 500,000 per year to 28 percent , the same level as under president @entity74 the total amount of money raised for the government by these actions would be about $ 210 billion over 10 years , according to the @entity30 , 99 percent of the tax burden from the capital - gains proposals would be paid by the top 1 percent of households , and more than 80 percent would be paid by the top 0.1 percent			1
people with significant amounts of unrealized gains include founders of successful businesses and others who inherited businesses decades ago			0
the moves -- likely to meet resistance from @entity19 in @entity92 -- are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the president began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class , including offering two free years of community college to qualified students			2
@entity0 's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top earners , who have been buoyed by record closes on @entity105			1
despite reams of positive economic news , most @entity3 still say economic conditions in the country are only fair			0
@entity0 is set to propose tuesday a $ 500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs ; the intention , officials say , is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working			1
he 'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits , including increasing the top child care credit to $ 3,000			2
the total cost for the new provisions : $ 235 billion , @entity0 has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his @entity14 address , including the community college proposal , a plan to expand high - speed internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages			1
in addition to the tax plan , he said he will push @entity92 for legislation allowing workers to earn seven days of paid sick leave per year and make community free for millions of students , at a cost of $ 60 billion over 10 years			1
the early look is meant to introduce @entity3 to each scheme individually , said administration aides , who determined the yearly laundry - list of plans -- combined with updates on @entity3 's foreign policy -- was n't digestible during a single prime - time event .			0
