' as it is a documentary , we stay between the bounds of fact			2
we ca n't make things up that did n't happen			0
but luckily , the truth is often stranger than fiction ! ' explains dr @entity53			0
' stories are very powerful in their real incarnation			2
' historian dr @entity48 was crucial to telling the stories of six @entity1 wartime experiences in their own words , in this groundbreaking documentary the characterisation of the six main personas is entirely based on their own word , using ' diaries , letters and correspondence , as well as the speeches they made , the public record they left , newspapers and archive research			1
' ‘ we found characters that left descriptive , detailed archives behind them			2
we needed to tell their own story			0
we see the war as they saw it , feel like they felt			2
it ’s not a contemporary reading or what we think they have felt or experienced			0
we ’re actually put in their shoes to see the war play out in real time			1
’ the personal accounts of war are some of the most frank , emotional and sensory descriptions of six very different war experiences			1
we are intimately acquainted with three men and three women , all engaged in the war in different ways , including those at war , those waiting at home , and those that fiercely opposed not only war , but conscription			2

the screenplay was created using the detailed , emotional accounts the six people each left of their wartime experiences			1
‘ we looked at the way the way war changed the six people as individuals and how the whole country changes , ’ @entity53 ‘ @entity4 was part of the daily fabric of everyone ’s lives , everyone was touched by war			1
’ dr @entity53 worked with the series ’ director , @entity151 to write the screenplay , which she calls ‘ a close and positive collaborative experience to bring two backgrounds and skills together			2
’ ‘ he is a professional in film and television and a magnificent storyteller			0
i could bring my own expertise and experience as a historian and that was a really wonderful working relationship , ’ said dr @entity53			0
the primary sources that carry the story are ‘ vivid , detailed and consistent , ’ giving a rare insight into not only the events that took place , but how the people involved felt during the terrifying , brutal war that claimed more than 40,000 lives between 1914 and 1918			1

‘ @entity35 wrote in his diary from a trench in @entity187			0
we hear his own words as he talks about his feelings			2
just like @entity35 , we do n’t know what the next day or even minute might hold for him			0
he knows and we know that death might be imminent , ’ said dr @entity53			0
in the diary , @entity35 wrote : ‘ everything in this diary is true and anyone reading it can believe what ’s written			0
i hope all at home can find something of interest for them , for that is the reason that i ’m writing it			2
‘ my job will be to bring it home safely			0
’ ' @entity35 ' prepared to repel @entity206 attack in a scene from the war that changed @entity13 @entity41 , who brought husband and father @entity181 back to life , is currently in @entity211 , visiting @entity1 @entity212 in @entity213 and @entity214 on the anniversary of the breakout of the war 100 years ago			1
‘ standing at the memorial sites that was the overwhelming question ... why ? i know there are complicated political and empirical answers to that question , but i could not think of a simple one			0
‘ i feel extremely fortunate to have this opportunity … it was an overwhelmingly emotional day , to stand on the very ground where so many thousands of @entity1 lost their lives during this conflict			1
it gave us ( my wife and @entity232 ) both pause to reflect on the futility of war and how little we seem to learn from it			0
’ a portrait of " @entity181 " @entity47 ( left ) and @entity238 ( right ) the actor who brings him to life in the new @entity28 documentary series @entity41 read extensively to understand the real “ @entity181 ” , and was moved by the words that remain for us to remember a man that time may otherwise have forgotten			1
‘ i read everything i could get my hands on			0
much of it , historical accounts and journals of his war service			2
' the best preparation i found was reading a biography written by @entity254 called " @entity47 " which was full of @entity181 's own words , letters home to his wife and children , accounts of him by soldiers who served under him and reports and communications on the battles he was engaging in			1
’ @entity41 in character as @entity47 and his young family			0
historian dr @entity254 was involved in the series and agrees that @entity181 ’s written words reveal him to be a complex , compelling man			1
‘ i was blown away reading the diaries and letters of @entity47			2
he was very frank and forthright – he called a spade a bloody shovel ! as a commander he was tempestuous , controversial but outstandingly successful			0
‘ but his letters underline how much he loved and cared ( for his family ) and lamented the fact that duty as he saw it lead him away from them for five years , ' said dr @entity254			0
@entity181 ’s correspondence with his wife are a treasure when it comes to understanding the impact of the war			0
‘ @entity181 's letters with his wife @entity289 are extraordinary			0
he had arranged with @entity289 to have a no - secrets pact in their correspondence while they were apart , so the letters are frank and illuminating			2
' @entity41 as major general @entity293 mr @entity41 was moved by passages of @entity181 ’s writing			0
‘ after the fateful battle of @entity44 ( @entity181 ) stood in the trenches , tears streaming down his face shaking the hand of every soldier returning from the fight and saying " i 'm sorry ... i 'm sorry ... "			0
' and although he was the consumate soldier , his letters home to his wife and children were extremely emotional and loving - yet graphic regarding the nature of the conflict			1
he was a very complicated man			0
' ‘ reading the personal accounts , not only from @entity181 but from others at that time , gives you a connection to the emotion they were feeling			0
the sounds , the smells , the existence they were forced to endure comes alive			0
i think it allows you to perhaps imagine yourself in their place			0
in playing the role of " @entity181 " , studying his letters and visiting memorials , @entity41 still can not make sense of the ' futility ' of war and enormous loss and tragedy that occurred , despite it being 100 years since the war began			1
in revisiting the past , dr @entity53 , hoped to complicate people 's understanding of @entity4			1
' the further we are from historical events , the simpler they are and it ’s easier to make sense of it			0
it ’s important to realise that the people in those times , like us , found it hard to understand or make sense of the events			0
it helps us empathise with @entity4			2
' @entity41 , in engaging with the stories of @entity4 , believes there is no sense can be made of the hurt , destruction and loss that occurred during the war			1
i have a greater understanding now of how the war effected not only those away fighting , but those at home			2
60,000 telegrams delivered to families advising them that there loved one was gone			0
' 156,000 telegrams delivered advising their husband , son , brother was wounded or worse taken prisoner			0
what a fearful 4 years , 3 months and 1 week they must have been			0
' @entity1 may find some of the experiences and messages of the film are far too relevant to our own lives			1
‘ we realise in revisiting this time in history that we do n’t always learn from the lessons of the past , ’ said dr @entity53 .			0
