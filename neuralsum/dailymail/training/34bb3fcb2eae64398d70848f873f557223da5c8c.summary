the @entity0 has been briefed on an investigation into sgt @entity3 's disappearance from a base in @entity5 five years ago			1
details about the probe 's conclusion have been closely held			0
but they are likely to lay out whether @entity3 deserted his post or was ' absent without leave ' or @entity11			1
and it could include recommendations on whether @entity3 should be charged with any criminal violations or forced to leave the @entity15			1
any final disposition will eventually also determine whether @entity3 gets as much as $ 300,000 in back pay and other benefits , including continued health care			1
@entity3 disappeared on june 30 , 2009 , reportedly walking away from his unit after expressing misgivings about the @entity60 military 's role — as well as his own — in @entity5			1
he was captured by the @entity28 and held by members of the @entity63 , an insurgent group tied to the @entity28 that operates both in @entity64 and @entity5			0
on may 31 , @entity3 was handed over to @entity60 special forces in @entity5 as part of an exchange for five top @entity28 commanders who were imprisoned at @entity69 , @entity70			0
after spending about two weeks recuperating at a @entity60 military hospital in @entity72 , @entity3 was sent to @entity73 at @entity74 on june 13			0
he is now doing administrative duties at the base , awaiting the conclusion of the case			0
officials suggested that the report 's findings may not be made public any time soon			0
' sometimes investigations are used in follow - on judicial processes , and therefore are not released until those judicial processes are complete , ' said navy rear adm. @entity85 , @entity0 press secretary			0
@entity3 's former platoon leader , sgt. @entity87 , and @entity15 lieutenant colonel @entity88 , a frequent @entity90 guest , joined @entity92 ' @entity91 to discuss the @entity15 's announcement that it had not reached a verdict yet , even though the general conducting the investigation has finished his report ' there 's no way that they can conclude this investigation without the truth , ' @entity87 told @entity91			1
the truth , he said , is that @entity3 deserted			2
' there 's not one person [ from his platoon ] who disagrees , ' @entity87 claimed he added that @entity108 's briefing is ' informational ' and the @entity0 chief is not expected to have input into the investigation or make any decisions on the case			1
' the secretary is not going to do arm twisting ' in the case , said @entity85 of @entity108			0
' there 's no role for him in the process to modify the investigation			0
' an initial @entity60 military investigation in 2009 concluded that @entity3 deliberately walked away , based on evidence available at the time			2
since his release , some former soldiers who served with him have labeled him a deserter and said he should be held accountable for leaving his post			0
others have suggested that troops were put in danger , and even killed , as they tried to find @entity3			0
sgt. @entity3 is pictured here in an undated photo provided to reporters by the @entity15			1
if @entity3 is cleared of desertion charges , he 'll receive $ 200,000 in back pay and stands to gain another $ 150,000 in compensation for his ordeal but there are also those who contend that even if @entity3 deliberately walked away , his five years in captivity were more than enough punishment for the soldier			1
shortly after @entity3 was released , army gen. @entity143 , chairman of the @entity144 , left open the possibility that an @entity15 investigation could result in desertion or other charges			1
@entity143 was briefed on the results of @entity151 's investigation earlier this week and @entity108 got a similar briefing on friday afternoon			2
maj. gen. @entity151 was tasked to conduct an exhaustive investigation into the matter , and spent months interviewing unit members and commanders , and meeting with @entity3 and his attorney , @entity158 , a military justice expert who is also a visiting lecturer at @entity159			2
he submitted his report in mid-october , setting off a lengthy legal review on his report and how the @entity15 can legally proceed in the case			2
the deal to swap prisoners with the @entity28 , meanwhile , enraged members of @entity167 who complained the administration violated requirements to inform lawmakers of any such transfer 30 days in advance			0
a report by the nonpartisan @entity174 said the @entity0 broke the law by not telling @entity167 and using nearly $ 1 million of a wartime account to make the transfer			2
@entity108 told @entity167 that the @entity0 ' acted lawfully in the operation to recover sgt. @entity3 , a judgment that was supported by the @entity180			1

the @entity0 , including @entity182 , briefed on investigation to determine is sgt @entity3 was ' absent without leave ' or @entity11
@entity3 could get as much as $ 300k in compensation
' we *explained* exactly what happened . he deserted his post *...* and we *'re* now still sitting here waiting for answers , ' @entity3 's former platoon leader said
if the @entity15 does *n't* release its finished review to the public , a member of @entity3 's platoon said he may file a @entity199 request
