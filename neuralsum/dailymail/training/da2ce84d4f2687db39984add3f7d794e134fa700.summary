by @entity0 i am lying on a hard bunk in a prison cell			1
there is a sinister wailing sound coming from the cell to my left			1
despite wrapping myself in the measly blanket like the @entity9 , i am freezing			1
apparently , they keep it icy cold in jail so that germs do n’t spread and i am wearing only a t - shirt , jeans and my @entity17 trainers – minus the laces , which they confiscated when they ‘ processed me ’			1
what is a nice girl like me doing in a place like this ? i went to the @entity23 for goodness ’ sake			2
@entity26 thought she had done nothing wrong travelling at 20mph , but she ended up spending a night in jail after @entity30 police pulled her over ‘ @entity31 is like jail			1
you sit around a lot and waste time , write on walls and get poked by people you do n’t know , ’ someone has scrawled on the wall			2
i hoped that was written by a man			2
at the moment , i am in my ‘ house ’ alone but i could get a ‘ cellie ’ or cellmate in the morning			2
oh yes , i am now down with the jailhouse slang			2
so how did i get here ? let ’s rewind a few hours			2
i am happily chuffing along @entity47 , singing along to my @entity48 , when i hear the dreaded sound of a police siren			1
i had been travelling at 20mph , so i was not worried			2
the policeman ( cute ) appears at my window			2
licence and registration : the usual drill			2
he saunters off back to his car to run my driver ’s licence through his computer			2
i am in a rush , so i am feeling irritated			2
eventually , he strolls back to my window			2
officer @entity62 invites me to sit in the back of his police cruiser			1
clearly , he has me confused with someone else			2
he then wanders off , muttering into his shoulder walkie - talkie thing			0
royal connection : @entity26 ( left ) with her aunt @entity68 ( centre ) , and her cousin @entity70 ( right ) @entity68 's daughter one of his cop buddies arrives and they chat for a while , staring at me			1
‘ step out the car , madam			0
’ finally , i am on my way			0
‘ turn round and face the car			0
you have the right to remain silent			0
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law			1
’ he says as he snaps handcuffs around my wrists			0
what am i being taken into custody for ? apparently , there is a $ 40,000 ( about £ 26,000 ) warrant out for my arrest			0
i was pulled over because my registration had expired and the warrant was issued because i forgot to go to court for a traffic violation			1
it seems excessive for a traffic violation			1
during the ride to the police station , i go from furious ( ‘ i want your badge number			1
i am going to sue everyone ’ ) to panicked ( ‘ am i going to have a criminal record ? ’ ) to crying because i am frightened they are going to make me bend over and cough			0
the car and bike enthusiast , pictured at a secret location for a private viewing of the @entity112 , was ' outraged ' at the ordeal in police cells the cop says i will be in front of the judge tomorrow and then i ’ll be able to go home			1
we drive into the back area of the jail , where i am marched in and ‘ processed ’			1
this includes an extremely intimate pat - down by a cross female officer			0
i do n’t know how @entity125 and @entity126 look pretty in their mugshots ; i look like serial killer @entity129			0
whereas they can afford to bail themselves out immediately , i do n’t have a spare $ 5,000 ( about £ 3,200 )			0
it is then i am told that there is no court the next day because of budget cuts			1
so i will be held until friday morning , 48 hours away			0
i have one phone call but it can only be to a landline number			0
how many landline numbers do you know ? i can call my mum , but waking her in the middle of the night from the @entity143 would not look good			1
i spend one long , lonely , soul - cold night curled up on a thin mattress with no pillow			1
i cry myself to sleep and at some point am woken by a scary - looking man in an orange jumpsuit ( on ‘ work release ’ from jail ) who brings me a plastic bag with some bread , peanut butter and an apple			1
hours later , a very nice female officer tells me there is court after all , handcuffs me again and escorts me to the big yellow jailhouse bus , which is stuffed with people from county jail ( real criminals )			1
it is just like you see in films			0
there is even rap music playing , and there is a cage situation at the back with all of the male prisoners , who shout lewd remarks			0
the next eight hours are spent in a shared cell underneath the courthouse			0
even worse than people using the loo – plonked in the corner in a tiny , windowless cell – ( i dare n’t gag in case i get beaten up ) is feeling so cold			0
zero tolerance : a police officer on patrol in @entity182 remembering that you lose a high percentage of body heat from your head , i am so desperate i wrap mine up in loo roll , like a mummy , with a small slit for my eyes			1
another prisoner i ’ve become friendly with does the same , except for some reason she only leaves a slit for her mouth			0
we both laugh our heads off for the next five minutes , rolling around on the concrete bench			0
a moment of light relief			0
finally , eight hours later , i get to speak to the public defender			0
when she looks at my charge sheet , she seems surprised that i have been locked up			1
and , after another hour handcuffed in the corner of the courtroom , so does the judge			0
he dismisses the charges and i do n’t even have to pay court costs because of ‘ time served ’			1
i am escorted back into a cell in the basement and endure another long wait until i am ‘ processed out ’ and given a plastic bag with my personal items			0
my new friend is going back to the county jail because she really is a criminal			1
‘ i am going to laugh if i see you back here again , ’ is a female officer ’s parting shot before i am released from the bowels of the courthouse into the evening sunshine			0
next time you are pulled over for a minor traffic violation , thank your lucky stars you live in @entity229			1
do n’t get me wrong , i love living in the @entity30 – i just do n’t love its legal system			1
even though i can now look back on the experience and laugh , i have definitely been traumatised by it			0
nowadays , if i even see a police car , i feel as if i am going to have a panic attack			1
it makes me long for @entity229 bobbies .			0
