by @entity0 published : 06:43 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 08:14 est , 7 november 2013 he 's already made a name for himself as the @entity5 's top @entity4 tribute act but now mr @entity6 - a.k.a @entity8 - is set to make a bid for singing stardom under his own name			1
the singer , who plans to enter next season 's @entity5 's @entity15 competition , hopes that the festive tune will hit the number one spot - and raise plenty of money for charity in the process			1
entitled here we are ( @entity25 ) , the three - minute track was penned by aspiring songwriter @entity26 , 25 , from @entity27			0
' when i gave @entity8 a call and sent him the song we received a positive reaction , ' explains @entity26 , who spent more than five years searching for the perfect person to sing the track			0
' we then met up and recorded the vocals on the hottest day of the year in a converted attic studio in @entity50			0
' proceeds from the single will go to @entity53 , an organisation that funds poverty - alleviating initiatives around the world , and @entity57 , a @entity58 - based charity aimed at tackling nastiness to children			2
' i recorded the single when we had incredible weather late july so it was strange singing about @entity25 but i feel that the @entity5 market has been crying out for a proper @entity25 song that tells about the true values and ethos of @entity25 , ' explains @entity8			2
@entity67 : @entity8 recently returned from an all - expenses paid trip to @entity70 - accompanied by his mother triumph : @entity8 had to beat off some tough competition to triumph at the mr @entity6 pageant charity : @entity8 ( pictured with his mother in @entity70 , left ) now spends much of his time helping good causes ' this song , i believe , does that			1
i 'm hoping that we can make it into the top 40 and who knows , with the public behind us , maybe even the number one spot			0
' singing is my life and since winning mr @entity6 , doors have really started to open up for me in the industry			2
' i hope that everyone gets behind the record as it 's for a good cause and it would be nice to have a real @entity25 song on that top spot			0
' @entity8 , 25 , from @entity27 , took home this year 's mr @entity6 title after impressing the judges with his @entity4 tribute act during the talent round			1
no stranger to pageants , he came runner - up in the 2011 mr @entity50 competition and triumphed in the mr @entity110 event in 2012			0
since taking home the mr @entity6 prize , @entity8 has concentrated on charity work and is an ambassador for @entity117 ’s @entity116 , which has branches in @entity50 , @entity119 and @entity120 .			1

mr @entity6 , @entity8 , was once a @entity4 tribute act
the festive single , here we are , is the first under his own name
proceeds will be split between poverty and *anti-bullying* charities
hopes to *pursue* a singing *career* and will enter @entity5 's @entity15
