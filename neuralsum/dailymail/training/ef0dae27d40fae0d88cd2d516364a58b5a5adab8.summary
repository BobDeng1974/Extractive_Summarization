by @entity1 reporter published : 11:41 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 12:44 est , 12 july 2013 @entity3 's party boycotted a summit of @entity6 's fragile coalition government and blocked parliamentary activity on wednesday in protest against a supreme court decision to fast track a ruling that could ban him from public office			1
the former premier 's party forced legislative procedures to be suspended in parliament for a day , because of the protest by @entity3 's @entity19 ( @entity19 ) party , one of the two main partners in @entity23 's left - right coalition government			1
while the disgraced former leader was embroiled in political campaigning , his daughter @entity24 was pictured relaxing on a quiet and secluded beach in @entity28 , with @entity30 model boyfriend , @entity29 and their son @entity31			1
happy couple : @entity24 with @entity30 model @entity29 and his son @entity34 at @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity28 miss @entity24 , 27 , has been linked to the @entity30 model since 2011 and the couple looked content in each others company on the @entity6 isle			1
they reportedly first met at a @entity42 fashion show and were said to have started dating straight after			0
the pair , who are on holiday at the @entity35 , @entity36 , in @entity28 , made themselves comfortable in the shade with seven - month - old son sat between them			1
they are on holiday with friends as well as @entity52 , the former premier 's glamorous daughter , who was spotted relaxing in the sun and getting close to economics student @entity55 this week			0
father @entity3 announced the arrival of his seventh grandchild in january when he was invited to the tv programme @entity58			0
content : the couple looked relaxed and content as they sheltered from the sun on a secluded beach in @entity28 good life : @entity24 smiles as her boyfriend and father of her son @entity31 reaches in for a kiss he was quoted saying at the time : ' the political issues are far away from me now			1
i became grandfather for the seventh time : a baby named @entity31 was welcomed by my daughter @entity76 , he weighs 3kg and 200grams , ' he said during the interview			0
now however , it appears political issues are inescapable for the former prime minister who is trying to appeal being barred from politics			0
the supreme court decision to fast track a ruling to ban him from public office , has aggravated tension in the squabbling coalition which was already under fire for the slow pace of reforms desperately needed to boost recovery from the worst recession since @entity95			2
@entity96 , leader of the populist @entity97 which stunned @entity6 by winning an unprecedented quarter of the vote in a february election , said @entity6 was heading for catastrophe because of the government 's failure to take extraordinary measures to tackle the economy			0
he said @entity6 was like a pressure cooker ' on the verge of blowing up ' and called on president @entity108 to call an election as soon as possible			0
the daughter of @entity6 's former premier has been linked to @entity112 @entity29 since 2011 the arrival of the couple 's baby boy was announced by @entity3 in january during a tv interview beautiful setting : the serene scene was far from the political turmoil that faces @entity3 whose party blocked legislative proceedings today via a boycott the supreme court was forced to issue an unusual statement defending its decision on tuesday to hear @entity3 's final appeal on july 30 against a tax fraud conviction			1
the 76 - year - old media magnate 's lawyers had not expected a ruling until late in the year			0
the court will rule on whether to uphold a four - year jail term and five - year ban on holding public office for complicity in tax fraud at @entity3 's @entity138 television empire			1
although @entity3 will probably escape jail because of his age if the sentence is confirmed , he could be thrown out of parliament in what would be a major shock to @entity147 's fragile government			2
@entity147 said the government would survive whatever happened but some hawks in @entity3 's party are thought to want to force an election in october if he is condemned			1
in an attempt to ensure @entity19 loyalty , @entity153 again promised in a television interview that he would abolish a hated housing tax which is the @entity19 's central demand , despite the difficulty of remaining within @entity160 budget constraints			0
the groups of friends spent some time on the beach relaxing before carrying their buggies and children back over the rocks the supreme court said it had been forced to call a special summer sitting on july 30 because part of the case against @entity3 will expire under the state of limitations on august 1			0
@entity3 and his aides believe the court decision , in sharp contrast to the usual snail 's pace of @entity6 's legal system , is another example of what he calls sustained and undemocratic persecution by leftist magistrates			2
@entity6 's former prime minister @entity3 , pictured in february , faces a supreme court decision to fast track a ruling to ban him from public office the former premier said the decision was inspired by his enemies in the @entity42 prosecutor 's office who have brought many cases against him , including his recent conviction for paying for sex with a @entity197 - born underage nightclub dancer nicknamed ' @entity198 ' and abusing his office to try to cover it up			1
he was sentenced to seven years jail in the ' bunga bunga ' case last month but that sentence will not become definitive until two appeals are exhausted			0
@entity3 has played a key role since @entity147 's government was formed in april in keeping his hawkish lieutenants on a tight leash , but the supreme court decision has sparked demands for street protests and blocking of all parliamentary activity			2
a substantial faction of @entity147 's own centre - left @entity214 also opposes the government alliance with @entity3 but @entity108 , the effective godfather of the coalition , is adamantly opposed to early elections in the midst of @entity6 's worst postwar recession .			2

legislative procedures to be suspended in parliament for a day after @entity3 's party protested against a court ruling to ban him from office
meanwhile , in @entity28 , his daughter @entity228 was a picture of happiness with @entity112 model boyfriend @entity29 and their seven - month - old son
