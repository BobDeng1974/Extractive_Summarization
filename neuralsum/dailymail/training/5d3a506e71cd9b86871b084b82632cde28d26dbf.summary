' i am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines , " he told the @entity52 4 today programme			0
' are there die - in - the - ditch issues which i have highlighted in the past which i care about , frankly , even more than this ? yes			0
i think fairer taxes is something i 've campaigned for			0
' that is something i care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held			0
' mr @entity0 said that past history suggested there would be changes to the @entity109 treaties which would require a referendum in the @entity108 under legislation passed by the coalition			0
' i have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right , when something happens which merits that referendum , " he said			0
' if you look back at the development of the @entity166 , and subsequently the @entity109 , every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision - making authority is pooled at @entity60 level			0
' so i think , if history is any guide , it 's more than likely to happen again			0
at that point there should be a referendum , we 've guaranteed that in law			0
