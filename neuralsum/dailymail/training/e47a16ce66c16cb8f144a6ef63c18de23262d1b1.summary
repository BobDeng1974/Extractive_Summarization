the four men were jailed for 34 years between them after a six - month trial as judge @entity49 branded @entity50 ‘ arrogant and greedy , brazen to the last with no expression of remorse '			1
the judge told him : ‘ this trial has been nothing but another gamble for you but the odds have proved to be too long this time			2
‘ between 2005 and 2009 a substantial and sophisticated fraud was committed against banks and other lenders , some 14 of them or so			2
‘ the fraud was for the benefit of you , @entity1 , orchestrated by you and @entity41 and assisted in some ways by mr @entity45 and mr @entity44			1
‘ only a small amount was ever used for the purposes of the loan , and it was often a case of “ robbing @entity33 to pay @entity34 ”			2
partners in crime : @entity1 , 47 ( left ) recruited @entity41 , 45 ( right ) to act as his solicitor in the complex four - year fraud , which left innocent families in the @entity74 having to move out of their homes ‘ a great deal of money was blown on your excesses mr @entity1 , to keep up the vague pretence to your friends and others of what a rich and successful man you were			1
' he added : ' this was very well orchestrated , professional offending over a long period of time , using and abusing the identities of others			0
' this is a story of arrogance and greed			0
‘ you may be a good pilot and had a great vision for the development of properties in and around @entity11 but none of that exceeds your arrogance or greed			1
‘ you thought you were better than anyone else and you were unable to get over the need to show off your entrapments of wealth			0
‘ when it was all falling apart you could so easily joke with mr @entity41 - you were cynical to the last			1
‘ you were dishonest and had no compunction but to lie and defraud			0
ever since the enquiry in mid- 2009 by lenders and the enquiry of @entity109 in 2010 , you have continued in the same vein and lied ’			2
spree : @entity1 had a platinum membership at the @entity7 casino @entity28 , the court heard the court heard @entity1 and @entity41 fleeced @entity15 and @entity115 out of more than £ 6million , using variations on the name @entity118 to secure illegal mortgages between 2005 and 2009			1

‘ as time went by , however , he began to raise finance by fraud , ' said mr @entity127			0
‘ the loan applications would state that loan funds were to be used to refinance or purchase or develop a particular property			0

one house in @entity140 , @entity12 , was remortgaged five times for more than £ 3million pounds and has since been demolished			1

' this organised gang defrauded millions of pounds and i am pleased with the prison terms handed down to them			0
' i hope their time behind bars will give them the opportunity to reflect on the pain and misery their actions have caused			0
' we continue to investigate their financial affairs to bring @entity268 proceedings against them to ensure they do not benefit from their crime			0
' treat : @entity41 was handed an @entity179 card which he used to travel to @entity181 as payment one couple first learned of the fraud when bailiffs arrived on their doorstep in @entity278 , @entity279 , telling them their £ 1.5million home would be repossessed			2
the husband and wife had to take their 12 - year - old son out of school and move in with their in - laws for three years when the house became caught up in legal wrangling			2
the knock on the door came in mid- 2007 from a @entity293 representative			0
' he said he was here about a repossession , ' said the wife , who asked to remain anonymous			0
' they came because the mortgage had not been paid by @entity300 ... he said the owners were @entity300			0
i said " what are you talking about ? we are the owners "			0
' i did n’t know what was going on			0
i thought we were going to be evicted from our house			0
' once the problem was reported , fraud teams quickly began investigating the case , but that did not prevent the family ’s problems mounting			0
they were unable to sell their home as they had already planned , because it was caught up in the case			0

that meant moving nearly 80 miles away to stay with in - laws in @entity326 , @entity228			0
