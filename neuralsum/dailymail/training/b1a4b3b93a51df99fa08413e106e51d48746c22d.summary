@entity2 @entity1 candidate @entity0 conceded his @entity4 race on friday to @entity6 incumbent sen. @entity5 , telling supporters that he has no plan to seek a recount of more than 2.1 million votes cast â€“ even though state law entitles him to one			1
the final vote tally from the @entity13 will show @entity5 ahead by less than 17,000 votes , or a margin of about three - quarters of 1 per cent			1
' the votes just are n't there , ' @entity0 said friday , adding that he called @entity5 earlier in the day to congratulate him			1
@entity26 played the role of spoiler , earning verbal attacks from the state 's conservative republicans			2
' this is why the political right needs to be united , ' a @entity33 political operative told @entity36 in an email friday			2
' a @entity26 comes along on an ego trip and produces an anomaly like this in the middle of an otherwise devastating landslide			0
' @entity5 , a former governor who is one of @entity20 's most popular politicians , had been expected to handily win a second term			0
but @entity0 , a former @entity46 chairman , rode a wave of support for @entity33 candidates nationwide , and almost knocked @entity5 out of the @entity1 despite being outspent heavily			1
on thursday , @entity5 told reporters he was confident that his lead would hold up			0
he said it would be unprecedented in @entity20 for such a lead to evaporate in either the canvass , as the formal counting process is called , or a recount			0
@entity5 said he was focusing now on his next term , which would begin in january , and planned to promote a centrist agenda that could attract bipartisan support			0
he said he wants ' to show that we can get the @entity1 to actually work			0
' ' i will spend every day working to get the @entity1 back in the business of solving problems and not simply scoring political points , ' @entity5 said in a statement			2
' i will work with anyone , @entity2 or @entity67 , to shake - up this dysfunctional @entity68 and move us toward common ground			0
' @entity0 's concession did not change the balance of the @entity1			1
tuesday 's elections put @entity2 in control with at least 52 of 100 seats in the chamber			0
the @entity78 race between @entity6 sen. @entity79 and @entity33 challenger @entity80 remains uncalled , and in @entity83 , @entity6 sen. @entity81 and @entity2 @entity82 are competing in a dec. 6 runoff			1
sen. @entity5 , shown with wife @entity5 , will represent @entity86 for six more years , following his razor - thin margin of victory over @entity0			1

@entity91 candidate played spoiler and *scooped* up 2 per cent of the vote , *denying* the @entity33 another belt - notch in an otherwise *triumphant* election
*democrat* @entity5 will *return* to the @entity1
@entity0 was the @entity2 's chairman before becoming a candidate himself
the final margin was barely *16* , 000 votes out of more than 2.1 million cast
' the votes just are n't there , ' @entity0 told supporters on friday , saying that he had conceded the race
