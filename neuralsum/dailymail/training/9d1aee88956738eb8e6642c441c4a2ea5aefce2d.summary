by @entity0 last updated at 7:17 pm on 1st january 2012 the archbishop of @entity2 today defended rioters who took part in last summer 's unrest claiming many young people felt ' let down ' by @entity7			1
he called on the public in a broadcast @entity10 message not to give up on the younger generation and show them support and love so they can ' flourish '			0
dr @entity16 described the violence as ' angry ' and ' lawless ' but claimed the country had failed its youngsters by being ' suspicious and hostile ' towards them and not providing good role models			1
smiling : the archbishop of @entity2 , dr @entity16 claimed @entity7 was ' suspicious ' and hostile ' describing the disturbances which swept the country , he said : ' quite a lot of the images we 're likely to remember from the footage of the riots in the summer will be of young people out of control in the streets , walking off with looted property from shops , noisily confronting police and so on			1
dr @entity16 : ' the events of the summer were certainly horrific ' ' it all feeds into the national habit of being suspicious and hostile when we see groups of youngsters on street corners or outside shops and bus shelters			2
' we walk a bit more quickly and hope we can pass without some sort of confrontation			0
' the events of the summer were certainly horrific			0
they showed us a face of our society we do n't like to think about - angry , destructive , lawless			1
' in his message screened on @entity54 , he said those involved were a minority and most young people shared the ' general feeling of dismay at this behaviour '			2
dr @entity16 was filmed talking to young people at @entity61 in south @entity62 that helps youngsters in poverty who are at risk of falling into criminal behaviour			1
he said : we have to ask what hind of society is it that let 's down so many of its young @entity70 does n't provide good role models and drives youngsters further into unhappiness			0
and anxiety by only showing them suspicion and negativity			0
' when you see the gifts they can offer , the energy that can be released when they feel safe and loved , you see what a tragedy we so often allow to happen			0
dr @entity16 ' comments risk another clash with @entity87 who warned last month the @entity88 should ' keep on the agenda that speaks to the whole country			2
' meanwhile , pope @entity91 praised young people as key to securing a future of hope despite what he called ' shadows on the horizon of today 's world			1
' papal blessing : pope @entity91 celebrates mass in @entity101 at the @entity102 today with a new year message in the splendour of @entity101 , with ambassadors to the @entity106 from dozens of countries seated in the front rows , the @entity109 , wearing white vestments with gold - colored trimmings , celebrated @entity112 on a day the @entity102 dedicates to world peace			1
he said : ' i would like to underline the fact that , in the face of the shadows that obscure the horizon of today 's world , to assume responsibility for educating young people in knowledge of the truth , in fundamental values and virtues , is to look to the future with hope			1
' young people , he said , must ' learn the importance and the art of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect , dialogue and understanding			2
' young people by their nature are open to these attitudes , but the social reality in which they grow up can lead them to think and act in the opposite way , even to be intolerant and violent			2
message : a balloon floats in the wind as the @entity91 gives his message praising young people during the @entity144 prayer but they will become ' builders of peace ' if properly educated , he predicted			1
the 84 - year - old looked tired during @entity112 , but his voice was strong , and he smiled and chatted briefly with families and young children who carried gifts to him during the ceremony			0
he seemed amused by one pacifier - sucking infant as the parents kneeled before the @entity91			0
as he has for the past few months , @entity91 used a wheeled platform , guided by ushers , to moved down the basilica 's long aisle between entrance and main altar			0
after mass , in remarks in @entity165 from his studio window overlooking @entity167 , jammed with tens of thousands of @entity169 , tourists and pilgrims , @entity91 invited all to pray with him ' earnestly for peace throughout the world , for reconciliation and forgiveness in areas of conflict , and for a more just and equitable distribution of the world 's resources			0

' they showed us a face of our society we do n't like to think about - angry , destructive , lawless ' says dr @entity16
