@entity1 legend @entity0 has told @entity2 he has no right to complain about the hectic holiday season programme in the @entity5 when he chose to go and work there			1
writing in his weekly column in the daily @entity8 , @entity0 said the @entity10 manager had to accept the @entity12 way of running their league without a winter break			1
' if you choose for ( a job in ) @entity12 , then you choose for their successful system , which is based on the proposition that the stadiums open as soon as the fans are available to watch , which is the holiday period , ' @entity0 said			2
@entity10 boss @entity2 has been critical of the club 's busy festive fixture list ' playing football between @entity27 and @entity28 is a war of attrition and thus in favour of physically stronger teams			1
' any attempt by @entity34 to try to change the system would be doomed to failure , added @entity0 , who has had a strained relationship with his compatriot and has criticised @entity34 's organisation of the @entity10 team since taking over in july			1
' it has been working ( well ) since time immemorial and in 100 years it will still be so , ' @entity0 said			0
' complaining makes no sense if everyone else around you is happy			0
moreover , everybody is well paid for working over the holiday period			0
' @entity50 legend @entity49 says @entity34 ca n't moan as he already knew there was no winter break in @entity12 @entity34 said the over-crowded festive fixture schedule neglected player welfare and short - changed millions of supporters			1
' everybody knows the body can not recover within 48 hours , ' he said last month			0
' therefore there is a rule within @entity60 and @entity61 that you can not play the games within two days			2
the scientists have proven it , everybody knows it and , in spite of that , we have to play			0
' it is the culture of @entity12			0
i do n't mind , but it 's not good for the players , for the health of the players , and it 's not good for the game , ' said @entity34			2
