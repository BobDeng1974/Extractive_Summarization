by @entity0 published : 11:11 est , 7 june 2013 updated : 02:44 est , 8 june 2013 a @entity2 council has been been accused of ' cultural vandalism ' over plans to sell off £ 13million of its giant collection of @entity7 and other @entity9 dynasty antiques			1
at least 24 of @entity12 's @entity11 's most expensive items , including tomb models and china dating back to the ninth century , could now be auctioned			1
the borough says it can not display much of its 230 - piece collection - bequeathed by local businessman and collector @entity20 in 1964 - because they can not afford ' @entity17 - style security '			1
historic : this stoneware narcissus bowl from the 14th century is among the items likely to be sold by @entity11 , who hope it 'll raise £ 13million in a move being called ' cultural vandalism ' delicate : this perfectly preserved porcelain cake box from the @entity31 period in @entity9 , made between 1573 and 1619 , will also probably go to auction some of the collection , which spans from @entity35 times to the 19th century , has featured at other galleries and museums , including the @entity38			1
@entity39 : this antique , a porcelain pilgrim bottle from the @entity42 ( 1426 to 35 ) , is also likely to be up for grabs for a small fortune the items proposed for sale have been moved to a central @entity2 location for valuation			2
the council said the sell - off had the backing of the @entity20 family as long as the proceeds were spent on culture in the borough			1
it plans to use the proceeds to help fund the refurbishment of @entity59 , the 1962 concert hall in @entity12			0
but the plans have angered some local historians and residents , with a petition calling on council leader councillor @entity64 to stop the sale reaching nearly 200 signatures in five days			0
@entity67 , who started the petition , said the sale would be ' cultural vandalism ' , adding : ' these pieces are a real asset to the borough and should be cherished for the benefit of all			0
' selling them off to chase a quick buck is short sighted			0
' @entity78 , a local historian and archivist , said the threatened collection could have educational value as well as attracting visitors			0
he added : ' the collection may not seem part of our heritage but it is , because @entity7 porcelain was very popular in 18th century @entity88 and @entity89 and @entity91 potters were inspired by it , launching our own fine china industry			2
' a rival petition supporting the sale currently boasts 86 signatures			0
it was launched on wednesday			0
valuable : this fine porcelain saucer from the @entity100 period , 1522 to 1566 , is one of 24 items likely to go under the hammer well known : some of @entity12 's collection has been at the @entity38 ( pictured ) but the council say they can not afford the ' @entity17 - style security ' they need for it councillor @entity108 , the council 's culture spokesman , said the items proposed for sale - which he claimed had never been exhibited in @entity12 - were wasted as it could not afford to insure them for display			1
he said : ' individually they are all very valuable items , very small and very portable , so to a professional gang a very tempting target			0
' in order to put the items we are talking about on display we would have to add @entity17 - style security to the @entity20 gallery - things like laser alarms - and that would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds			1
' he added : ' what is the point of keeping some very valuable items in a crate in a vault ? is n't it better to use the money you 've got tied up in that for something we can all access ? ' the sale will be considered by the council 's corporate services committee on july 24 .			2
