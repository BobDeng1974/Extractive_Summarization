by @entity0 published : 01:57 est , 18 march 2013 updated : 10:28 est , 18 march 2013 @entity2 's coverage of the @entity4 rape story has been roundly criticized after the cable news network focused on the devastating effect on the ' promising ' lives of the rapists and not the 16 - year - old victim			1
as the breaking news of the guilty verdict against @entity15 football players @entity13 , 17 , and @entity16 , 16 , was relayed from the @entity18 court - room on sunday , anchor @entity10 turned to correspondent @entity19 , who seemed more affected by the tearful reactions of the two teens			1
@entity19 described the scene in the court as , ' incredibly difficult , even for me , to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures , star football players , very good students , literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart			1
' scroll down for @entity32 @entity10 broke the news to @entity2 viewers that @entity13 , 17 , and @entity16 , 16 , had been found guilty of rape on sunday in @entity4 , @entity36 ' one of the young men , @entity16 , as that sentence came down , he collapsed , ' added @entity19 , saying that the rapist turned to his attorney and said , ' my life is over , no one is going to want me now			1
' during the segment , @entity2 aired court - room video of @entity47 in floods of tears over the verdict while he hugged his lawyer			1
' i was sitting about three feet from @entity54 when he gave that statement , ' said @entity19			2
' it was very difficult to watch			2
' social media immediately lit up with incredulous reaction to the tone of @entity2 's coverage about two young men who raped a severely intoxicated 16 - year - old fellow student and who then swapped pictures and stories of the teen online in the days afterwards			1
viewers of the cable news network expressed their dismay over the tone of coverage as @entity10 handed over to reporter @entity19 in @entity18 journalist @entity73 of the @entity74 was stunned , tweeting , ' honestly , save for openly blaming the victim , it 's hard to imagine how @entity2 could have covered the @entity4 verdict more ineptly			1
' members of the public were shocked too , with college student @entity79 taking to @entity80 to post , ' crack job reporting the @entity4 rape @ @entity2			1
we should always worry about how a conviction will ruin the lives of rapists , not the raped			1
' outrage at the beleagured news networks coverage peaked when @entity10 asked the resident @entity2 legal contributor @entity90 for his opinion on the verdict for , ' a 16 year old , sobbing in court , regardless of what big football players they are , they still sound like 16 year olds			1
' ' there ’s always that moment of just — lives are destroyed , ' @entity90 remarked			2
' but in terms of what happens now , the most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders			0
that label is now placed on them by @entity18 law			1
' ' that will haunt them for the rest of their lives			2
' ' employers , when looking up their background , will see that they 're registered sex offenders			0
when they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the @entity121 , where these things are posted , neighbors will know that they are registered sex offenders			0
' @entity80 users were forthright in their opinions regarding the coverage @entity2 gave to the guilty verdict in the @entity4 , @entity18 rape trial guardian journalist @entity73 was appalled with how @entity2 lamented lamented that the ' promising ' lives of the teenage rapists had been ruined other members of the public took the view that @entity2 had got their news angle for the trial wrong @entity134 , a digital producer for @entity137 's @entity136 show was scathing about what he saw as terrible reporting , ' i hope @entity2 is embarrassed by the way in which they covered the # @entity4 verdict			1
no guarantees , though , ' indeed , as both @entity15 students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened that august night last year , their remorse appeared overwhelming			2
both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21			0
emotion : @entity157 , @entity47 , 16 , pictured after hearing the guilty verdict and right , as he is helped by @entity161 , chief probation officer for the @entity163 juvenile court while apologizing to the victim and her family defense attorney @entity166 , ( right ) , holds his client , 16 - year - old @entity167 , ( second from right ) , while defense attorney @entity169 , ( left ) , sits with his client @entity13 , foreground , 17 , as judge @entity171 pronounces them both delinquent on rape and other charges today @entity13 faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor			1
he received the same sentence for that to run consecutively			0
his minimum detention is two years			0
his actions were , according to presiding judge @entity171 , ‘ more egregious ’ making it inappropriate that he should face the same sentence as @entity47			0
@entity47 ’s father , @entity187 , who has been present in court every day made his way over to his son , fell to his knees and told him that he loved him			0
‘ my life is ruined , ’ @entity16 told attorney his @entity194 , who was clearly shocked at the verdict			1
@entity197 father , @entity196 , held his head in his hands as the defendant ’s sister @entity200 and mother wept			0
both defendants took the opportunity to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a screened off section of seating			2
@entity13 , 17 , ( left ) , stands and apologizes to the victim and her family after he and co-defendant @entity167 , 16 , were found delinquent on rape and other charges after their trial in juvenile court in @entity4 , @entity18 today together : @entity13 , 17 , left , gets a hug from his father after @entity13 and co-defendant @entity16 , 16 , were found delinquent on rape and other chargesk @entity13 was composed as he said : ‘ i would like to apologize to [ the victim ] and her family , my family and the community			1
no pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken			0
’ but though @entity13 apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape			1
in every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 august he repeatedly denied raping her			0
in fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made			0
again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim , hectoring her , pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘ did n’t happen			2
’ crime : @entity13 and @entity47 were today found guilty of digitally penetrating a 16 - year - old @entity243 girl at a party last august on the map : the working class town of @entity4 , located in eastern @entity18 , has a population of around 18,000 standing in court , convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret , the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize			1
when it came to @entity47 ’s turn , he walked towards the victim and her family , across the courtroom , weeping ; ‘ i would like to apologize			0
i had no intention to put you guys through this			0
i do n’t know what to say			0
‘ i ruined her life			0
’ across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts , tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends			0
they have heard about pictures , been reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did and how they behaved , who they were , when nobody else was looking			0
the case has scandalized @entity281 and scarred the small town of @entity4 , @entity18			1
@entity13 and @entity47 will begin their sentence today			2
they will be taken to an institute just northwest of @entity287 , @entity18 where they will be assessed and a decision made as to where they should spend their time in custody .			2

@entity2 's coverage of the guilty verdict in the @entity4 rape trial in @entity18 has been heavily criticized
the cable news network appeared to lament the guilty verdict for rapists @entity13 , 17 , and @entity16 , 16
said their ' promising ' lives had now *fallen* apart
