' menace ' : 60 per cent of children polled said they have been asked for explicit photos more than half of teenagers have been asked to take an explicit self - portrait on their mobiles , according to a survey that reveals the full extent of the ‘ sexting ’ menace in schools			1
the practice of swapping sexual images is now seen as ‘ pretty normal ’ by youngsters , with more than half saying they had received an intimate photo or video , and 40 per cent having taken one of themselves			1
worryingly , many of the children polled by the charity @entity23 were happy to send revealing photos of themselves to strangers			1
as well as being shared on teens ’ smart phones , the pictures are also posted online on social media sites such as @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 – putting them at risk of being stolen			1
@entity23 said young people were taking huge risks by taking and sending the sexual images , and warned that some were being driven to the brink of suicide after the photos became widely shared			1
the survey of almost 500 children aged between 13 and 18 shows that 60 per cent have been asked for a sexual image or video – an indication of the huge pressures faced by youngsters to participate			1
of those who say they have sent a picture of themselves , a third said it had gone to someone they knew online but had never met , while 15 per cent admitted they had sent pictures to a total stranger			1
@entity58 , director of @entity59 , said the rise of classroom sexting was linked , in part , to the widespread availability of porn online			1
‘ the sharing of these images do not necessarily happen in isolation - it can be related to other online issues such as cyber-bullying and draw from influences such as celebrity and easy access of online pornography , ’ he said			2
‘ with the constant rise in smart technology being made available to young people , the self - generating and sharing of sexually - explicit images is not a fad that will go away			2
‘ we know that threatening young people with the consequences of their actions is not the most impactful way to engage them , in a similar way as telling them not to drink or smoke			2
’ the @entity88 is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect youngsters , with over- 18s only being able to see adult sites after a strict age verification check			2
earlier this week we revealed that tens of thousands of these intimate photos and videos are stolen and end up on paedophile websites			0
to deal with the problem , @entity23 is now teaming up with the @entity99 so that children have a point of contact to ensure that pictures of them are taken offline			1
and they have launched a new mobile phone app , @entity105 , to which offers witty images to send instead of explicit ones , advice for how to engage in safe chat , what to do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public			2
the @entity23 survey showed that 60.1 per cent of the youngsters had been asked to send a ‘ sext ’ , while 38.3 per cent had created one			1
most sent them to boyfriends and girlfriends , but others shared them with close friends			0
some 32.3 per cent said it had gone to someone they knew online but not in real life , while 15.3 per cent said they had sent a picture to a total stranger			1
of those who had sent a picture , 20 per cent said it had been shared with others , while 28.3 per cent said they did not know			2
@entity135 , the 17 - year - old interviewed by @entity23 , said he still engaged in the practice of sexting despite the dangers			1
‘ there are definitely risks involved , ’ he said			0
‘ someone saw a video message i had sent to a previous girlfriend , took a screen shot and posted it online			0
‘ they called me a pervert and lots of people i knew saw it			0
i was completely devastated and , to be honest , almost suicidal			0
’ danger : a third of people who sent ' sexts ' said they went to people they had met only online , while 15 per cent had sent images to total strangers ( posed by model ) he added : ‘ i ’ve never pressured anyone into sexting , and when any girl i ’ve been seeing has n’t been interested i ’ve been fine with that			1
there are some people though who will put pressure on you			0
‘ you do sometimes get a negative reaction to something you send , like people saying they ’ve “ seen bigger ”			0
’ @entity135 - his name has been changed to protect his identity - said that he often swaps photos with complete strangers			2
‘ i do worry about who is behind the phones of the people i sext with - obviously if you do n’t know the person in real life there ’s no guarantee they are who they say they are , ’ he said			0
‘ there is also a big risk around the ages of the girls you contact			0
of course you can ask , but there ’s no proof that they ’re telling the truth			0
’ @entity195 , chief executive of the @entity99 , said : ‘ we have sadly tracked a marked rise in self - generated sexual content featuring young people			0
‘ a snapshot study conducted by @entity99 analysts over a 47 - hour period found well over 12,000 self - generated images and videos of young people online			0
most recently , we see images and videos being gathered together and sold for commercial gain			0
‘ the @entity99 works strictly within @entity209 law ; we have to be certain that the image features someone under the age of 18 which is why this partnership with @entity23 is all the more important to ensure we can receive the information to remove explicit content as soon as possible			1
