the head of @entity2 intelligence has warned @entity3 that not renewing the @entity5 's controversial phone snooping program will ' raise the risk ' of another terror incident			2
@entity8 claims failing to extend part of the @entity10 , which allows the bulk collection of telephone records , will take away a vital tool in the kit of the intelligence agency			1
should @entity3 not renew @entity17 - due to expire on june 1 - then it must be prepared to shoulder the blame should an ' untoward incident ' take place , the director of national intelligence added during a question and answer session in @entity23 on monday			1
warning : @entity8 told a meeting in @entity23 that failure to renew @entity17 of the @entity10 - which allows mass collection of phone records - would effectively raise the risk of a terrorist incident ' in the end , @entity3 giveth and @entity3 taketh away , ' @entity8 told the group gathered at the @entity32			1
' if the congress in its wisdom decides the juice is not worth the squeeze that 's fine : the intelligence community will do all it can within the law to do what it can to protect the country			0
' but i have to say , every time we lose another tool in our tool kit , it raises the risk			0
' if that tool is taken away from us , and some untoward incident happens which could have been thwarted if we had it , i just hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes responsibility			1
' ' insurance ' : section 215 - revealed by @entity53 - has not prevented a single incident since it was brought in section 215 of the @entity10 - which also allows the @entity5 to obtain surveillance warrants without naming the person being wiretapped , as well as allowing the surveillance of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity but not affiliated with a terrorist organisation - was one of the most controversial powers brought to light by former security contractor @entity53			0
it has since been claimed @entity17 , set up in the wake of september 11 , has failed to stop one terrorist incident , leading to calls for it being reformed , or dropped altogether			2
senator @entity70 brought forward a bill last year , supported by @entity8 , which would have meant phone companies were in charge of keeping the records rather than the @entity76 or @entity5			0
but @entity77 blocked the sweeping overhaul when it came before the @entity79 last november			0
however , @entity8 remains a defender of the program			0
' @entity17 , to me , is like my fire insurance policy , ' he said on monday			1
' my house has not burned down , but every year i buy fire insurance just in case			2

@entity8 said failure to renew will mean the loss of a vital ' tool ' for spies
director of @entity94 said *opponents* of @entity17 need to be prepared to should the blame should another ' untoward incident ' occur
program has not stopped one terror attack since it was established in 2001
but @entity8 claims @entity17 is like having ' fire insurance ' for your home
