mr @entity1 said the alleged @entity9 fanatic ought to be able to mingle more freely with students at his university to avoid his ‘ embarrassment and isolation ’			1
the constraints on the 24 - year - old @entity16 man – considered one of the country ’s most dangerous terror suspects – were ‘ chilling ’ and ‘ disproportionate ’ , he said			1
his @entity21 ruling ordering home secretary @entity22 to water down the restrictions deals a serious blow to the government ’s fight against terrorism			2
and it comes despite fears by the security services that the man – known as @entity32 – will contact other @entity34 extremists to plot attacks against @entity36			2
the decision could lead to similar challenges by other terror suspects and may fuel concerns that the judiciary is chiselling away at measures to protect the @entity36 from jihadists			0
‘ @entity32 ’ is one of nine people subject to @entity46 and @entity47 ( @entity48 ) orders , introduced last year to restrict their movements , the use of computers and who they can meet			0

@entity84 mp @entity83 said : ‘ if this fellow was concerned about his social life then maybe he should n’t have been spending his time in @entity55 and @entity16			1
‘ his lack of social life does n’t keep me awake at night			0
