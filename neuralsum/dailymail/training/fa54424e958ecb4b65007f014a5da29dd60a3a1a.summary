couple : @entity6 , who nearly lost his life to the bubonic plague last year , has died at the age of 65 in @entity7 , @entity8			1

while @entity10 recovered within days , @entity6 was hospitalised for more than two months			1

suffering : mr @entity6 is wheeled out of a hospital in @entity76 , @entity8 , 12 years ago after receiving treatment for the bubonic plague			1
both of his legs were amputated as a result fleas that feed on infected rodents or other mammals typically transmit the plague bacteria			2

the plague is endemic in the area , with dozens of cases being reported since 1949			0

the disease , associated with the medieval period and made famous by historic etchings , similar to the one below of a @entity139 town crier in 1665 calling for plague victims to be brought forward , is caused by the bacteria @entity141 that is spread through flea bites			0
