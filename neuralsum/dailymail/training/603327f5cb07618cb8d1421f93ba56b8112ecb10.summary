chimpanzees have special ' words ' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups			1
primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in @entity11 adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in @entity17			1
their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects			1
previously scientists had believed such calls in response to food and alarm calls were an expression of their excitement and can not be controlled			1
chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of ' signature ' and to tell others in their group where they are			0
biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet			1
the noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting - are known as pant calls , and can be heard more than half a mile ( 1km ) away , even in the dense jungle			2
but now one group of scientists studying the animal in the @entity53 in the @entity54 in @entity55 , have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual			2
each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them			0
the researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling			2
they believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual 's whereabouts			0
many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture			1
now research by scientists at the @entity84 and the @entity85 is challenging this assumption			0
dr @entity87 , a psychologist at the @entity84 who led the study , said it could have new implications for the evolution of language in humans			0
she said : ' an extraordinary feature of human language is our ability to reference external objects and events with socially learned symbols , or words			1
' this represents the first evidence of non-human animals actively modifying and socially learning the structure of a meaningful referential vocalisation			0
' the socially learnt nature of referential words in humans is likely to have ancient evolutionary origins			0
' the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal of @entity115 , watched a group of adult chimpanzees from @entity118 in the @entity119 were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in @entity122			1
by analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples , they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010			2
while the @entity119 chimps used high pitched grunts the @entity17 chimps used far lower and softer sounds			1
after a year of integration , the grunt calls for apple were still different , but after three years the calls produced by the @entity119 chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from @entity17			1
@entity142 was a male in the original group of chimpanzees at @entity122 that used a specific call for ' apple ' @entity148 , above , a @entity119 chimp changed his high - pitched call for ' apple ' to a softer grunt like the @entity152 chimps the @entity119 chimpanzees ( left ) had different preferences for apples compared to the @entity17 chimps ( right ) the researchers found that by this time the chimpanzees had formed strong friendships and the groups had joined together into one			1
dr @entity159 , an evolutionary biologist at the @entity85 who also took part in the study , said : ' three years after the integration , the grunt calls of the new chimpanzees very much resembled the grunt calls produced by the @entity17 chimpanzees			1
' the preferences for apple in these chimpanzees stayed the same during this period , but the grunt calls changed			0
' he added : ' the fact that both humans and now chimpanzees possess this basic ability suggests that our shared common ancestor living over 6 million years ago may also have been socially learning referential vocalisations			2
' the findings are the first evidence that chimps like the one above can learn new calls for foods and objects scientists studying the @entity53 chimpanzee community living in @entity55 's @entity54 have been able to witness how the animals teach each other to use tools			1
the analysis began when one chimp called @entity192 , the 29 - year - old alpha male chimpanzee , made a moss sponge while being watched by @entity194 , a dominant adult female			0
over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges			0
six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way			2
the scientists also recorded a 12 - year - old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge			0
a further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique , but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first			0
by using a technique called network - based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a ' na√Øve ' chimpanzee observed moss - sponging , this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour			0
this striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role .			0

biologists studied chimps moved to @entity122 from the @entity119
the @entity119 chimps learned new grunts for apples from apes in @entity17
it is the first evidence that chimps can learn calls relating to specific foods
such behaviour was thought to be a defining feature of human language
it suggests this feature of *langauge* evolved far *longer* ago than believed
