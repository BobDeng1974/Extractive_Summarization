thousands of @entity1 labourers are working 18 hours a day to build @entity3 's football world cup infrastructure while their wages are directly siphoned off to fund @entity6 's regime			1
the men , who are told they 've been awarded the privilege of serving the dictator abroad , must meet strict criteria in order to be eligible to work overseas			2
this includes showing loyalty to the dictator 's political party , having money to bribe migrant officials , and having a wife and children in order to dissuade defection			2
the @entity3 government said there were 2,800 @entity1 registered to work on @entity3 's @entity39			1
to be finished in time for the @entity26 , it will be home to more than a quarter of a million residents and be capable of hosting tens of thousands more at its array of luxury hotels			0
it is formed by four islands and includes two luxury marinas - they will include a giraffe zoo , a snow park and a @entity53 amusement park , light rail network , two golf courses and a 86,000 seat stadium with a solar powered cooling system			1
however , the manner by which this stunning architectural design is achieved remains dogged by accusations the nation is using an army of modern day slaves			1
the @entity27 reported one worker said he was paid nothing - with all earnings going back to @entity1 where he believed he would be reimbursed upon his return			1
a more senior worker said he was paid the equivalent of £ 250 a month and the rest would be available for him to collect when he returned home			0
@entity74 , a @entity1 defector , told the paper : ' in the early 90s , workers did receive their salary but it has been stopped since the mid- 90s			0
the construction company that employed workers sent all the money directly to the @entity1 government 's bank account			2
' accusations that labourers are being poorly paid and badly treated have plagued the country 's world cup preparations			0
pictured is the country 's capital , @entity90 the @entity92 stadium is one of many that @entity3 plans to build for the @entity26 @entity94 , @entity95 director , said the conditions under which the labourers were working constituted slave labour			1
he said : ' it is simply a further dreadful indictment of the dictatorship in @entity102 , which exploits the vulnerability of its citizens to enrich itself in collusion with the @entity3 autocracy			0
' @entity3 's drive to construct stadiums and infrastructure capable of hosting a massive international event such as the world cup has been dogged by scandals			1
only late last month was it was forced to refute claims that money for @entity118 firms working on the @entity26 venues was being siphoned off to @entity121 extremists			2
the @entity122 was told @entity118 firms awarded contracts for the project in @entity3 were being short - changed while some of the unpaid cash had ended up in the hands of the @entity130 extremists in @entity131			0
but @entity3 prime minister sheikh @entity132 told @entity133 it was a ’ serious allegation ’ which the government ’ refutes completely ’			0
he said : ’ let me be clear , for the avoidance of doubt , we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the @entity142 and around the world to face down the terrorist threat			0

@entity1 labourers ' conditions described as akin to modern day slavery
the men work 18 hours a day and their pay is sent back to @entity6
