@entity0 to the north of this chic @entity3 region and find an affordable bolthole by @entity5 last updated at 4:38 pm on 14th october 2011 @entity6 somehow always sounds expensive , but @entity7 , a lesser - known area in the north , offers value for investors and second - home owners			1
it has dramatic topography , quite different to southern @entity6 , tucked as it is between the @entity15 and the @entity16			1
it is ideal for outdoor pursuits , and like the rest of the region is famous for its food and wine — in particular chestnuts			1
chestnut trees abound among the oaks and pines			1
value for money : homes in need of renovation are available for less in @entity31 if you enjoy renovating homes , there is an abundance of property in need of modernisation			1
@entity39 , with an office in @entity41 , has a number of ‘ wrecks ’ on its books , including a small estate at @entity47 , near the medieval walled town of @entity31			1
this comes with around seven hectares with chestnut and oak trees , a small vineyard and stone farmhouse , two barns and a shed , all aching for more than a spruce up			1
it is on the market for £ 329,000 , but something of this size would cost almost double in @entity60			1
‘ prices have dropped over the past couple of years , some properties by 10 - 15 per cent and there is still room for negotiation on the asking price			1
it ’s a very good time to buy , ’ according to @entity39 ’s @entity68 , a @entity69 with @entity3 heritage who moved to the area ten years ago			1
‘ abandoned villages and hamlets are also coming onto the market , often being sold by people who no longer have the money to fulfil their dream			1
’ one project well under way , is @entity80			2
this four - and - a - half hectare estate sits near the hamlet of @entity83 , five minutes from the town of @entity85			2
the developers , @entity87 and @entity88 , who live partly in @entity89 , partly in @entity3 , have converted the original farmhouse and are building eight new detached villas , four semi-detached villas and ten apartments with a communal pool			1
cheaper alternative : the entrance to the old town of @entity31 where there is an abundance of property in need of modernisation these are high specification with marble or granite kitchen worktops , bespoke chestnut doors and window frames			2
the rooms are spacious , some with vaulted wooden ceilings , and all have glorious views across the @entity7 valley			2
prices range from £ 310,000 for a two - bedroom apartment and from £ 568,000 for a three - bedroom villa			2
the main towns are @entity118 and @entity31			2
with its walled historic centre , @entity118 is a charmer — @entity124 singer @entity123 ’s family hail from here			0
the town is home to a large contingent of @entity124 , and at the end of july it even holds an annual @entity130 festival			0
@entity131 is an hour and 45 minutes away by car , but just 50 minutes to the south is the bustling town of @entity41 , where @entity135 was born			0
it is full of historic buildings with a famous summer music festival in july			0
this year , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 performed under the stars in the @entity143			0
‘ property in the area is excellent value for money , ’ says @entity144 , of @entity145			0
@entity6 is more accessible than the south in her opinion , with @entity153 between one hour and an hour - and - a - half away from most locations			0
there are also a number of main and local stations with regular services			0
she is selling a three - bedroom , semi-detached stone house with cellars , patio and garden , in the hamlet of @entity165 , six miles from @entity118 , for £ 87,000			0
this is on the road to @entity168 , which in winter becomes a ski resort			0
and in a hamlet near @entity172 , two - and - a - half miles from @entity118 , a two - bedroom apartment with garden is on the market for £ 118,000			0
