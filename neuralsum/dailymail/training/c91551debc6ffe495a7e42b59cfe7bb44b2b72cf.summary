by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 12:09 est , 12 march 2014 a taxi industry trade newspaper has threatened to out five ' secretly gay ' @entity4 officials unless they ban smartphone ride - sharing services which it says are threatening drivers ' jobs			1
publisher of the @entity9 , @entity10 , said the industry was under siege and , in an editorial in his latest issue , set out a list of 10 demands			1
mr @entity10 said his trade publication ' has learned that five of the city ’s 50 aldermen are closeted homosexuals			1
in the next issue of this newspaper , set to be published early next month , we will disclose their names unless our demands are met '			1
a @entity28 taxi industry official has threatened to out council bosses if his demands are not met ' the city is moving forward and will steamroll our industry if we do n’t act in earnest , ' he said			1
' they did it to my grandfather more than 100 years ago when they destroyed his horse - drawn - carriage business by allowing horseless machines to carry people around the city			2
' the five aldermen we will expose next month will only include those who have concealed their gay lifestyle to their constituents			0
' they are public servants who have a duty to truthfully disclose their sexuality to the voters			1
they are living a lie			0
' @entity28 mayor @entity54 's moves to change the city 's taxi industry are proving unpopular he added that if the city does allow ride - sharing - when fares are booked using apps such as @entity60 , @entity61 and sidecar - cars would require gps tracking ' so that our informant can keep telling us when @entity67 are taken from their homes and dropped off in @entity70 '			1
bizarrely , mr @entity10 also urged the city to ban the internet and rename the landmark @entity73 the @entity73 , prompting suspicion his threat may not be serious , according to @entity75 @entity28			2
he said ride - share drivers should be required to get annual chest x-rays , ' like the city - endorsed doctor had me do to renew my chauffeur ’s license last month			0
the riding public has no idea if ride - share drivers have tuberculosis '			2
also on mr @entity10 's hitlist were female ride - share taxi drivers , who he said should not be allowed behind the wheel			1
' one company boasts that 40 percent of its drivers are women			0
taxi driving is a male - dominated profession and it should remain that way , ' he said			2
' the last place for a woman is behind the wheel			0
if a woman needs a ride somewhere , she will only feel safe if the driver is a man			0
' @entity10 wants to change the name of the city 's @entity73 ( left ) to the @entity73 the controversial editorial comes as aldermen consider a move by mayor @entity54 to impose new regulations on ride - sharing companies including insisting they have insurance , pay a $ 25,000 - a - year fee and pay a $ 3.50 - per - day - per - vehicle tax			1
regular cab companies argue those fees are insignificant compared to the $ 350,000 cost of simply getting a licence			0
they have previously sued the city over the lack of regulations for ride - sharing companies , noting they can operate vehicles that are not accessible to the disabled			0
@entity10 says the modern taxi industry ruined his grandfather 's horse - drawn carriage business @entity128 , ceo for @entity129 , condemned what he called an ' outrageous attempt to blackmail the city of @entity28 and scornfully humiliate members of the @entity4 '			1
' however this article was intended , it is no joking matter			0
we call on the publication to immediately retract its extremely offensive article and apologize to the city ’s @entity141 community , women drivers and customers , the @entity4 and the public at large			2
the @entity146 , which represents cab companies and taxi medallion holders , said : ' the @entity146 and our affiliated taxi companies unequivocally condemn the piece that ran in today ’s @entity9 and the hateful message it sends			0
' this misguided attempt at parody has no place in this discussion and demonstrates an extreme lack of judgment or sensitivity			0

@entity10 vows to ' out ' councillors if they do *n't* *toughen* laws
