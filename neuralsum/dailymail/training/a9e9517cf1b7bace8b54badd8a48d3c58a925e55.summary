by @entity0 last updated at 8:40 am on 16th december 2011 @entity2 's new lawyer , who recently joined his defence team , has heaped further controversy on the disgraced @entity6 coach			1
attorney @entity7 tried to explain why @entity2 showered with boys , saying that some of the children helped by his @entity12 charity lacked basic hygiene skills			1
@entity7 told @entity14 in @entity15 : ' teaching a person to shower at the age of 12 or 14 sounds strange to some people , but people who work with troubled youth will tell you there are a lot of juvenile delinquents and people who are dependent who have to be taught basic life skills like how to put soap on their body			1
' deep water : a second lawyer for @entity2 , @entity7 , said he allegedly showered with boys from his charity in @entity15 to ' teach them about hygiene ' @entity7 later told the station that media accounts of his explanations have become ' somewhat exaggerated '			1
@entity2 , the former @entity6 assistant football coach , backed out of a preliminary hearing at the last minute on tuesday			2
after the hearing , another of @entity2 's lawyers @entity41 inadvertently made a mockery of his client 's case when he held an impromptu press conference outside the @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity15			1
controversy : former @entity6 coach @entity2 's legal team have continued to make questionable statements about the child sex abuse allegations which surround him @entity41 said that the grand jury report outlining the child sex - abuse charges was deeply flawed - including allegations that @entity6 coach @entity58 witnessed @entity2 rape a boy in a campus locker room and that he told this to @entity63			1
he said to them : ' if you believe this ( allegation ) then i suggest you dial 1 - 800 - reality ' unluckily for @entity41 - and @entity2 - it turns out this is the number for a gay - sex phone line with an opening message informing the caller it is the ' hottest place for triple - x action '			1
oops : attorney @entity41 speaks outside the @entity49 in @entity50 , telling reporters if they believe the accusations they can dial 1 - 800 - reality interest : media surround @entity2 's attorney @entity41 , top centre , as he holds an impromptu press conference today , continuing to protest his client 's innocence officials at a @entity15 college say @entity2 had contact with its football programme last year despite being told he failed a background check when applying to be a volunteer coach			1
@entity92 spokesman @entity91 says @entity2 consulted for the school 's former coach during the 2010 season despite the coach being informed @entity2 could n't be associated with @entity92 's program			1
the college says @entity2 applied to volunteer in may 2010 but was turned down after the background check revealed an investigation by a high school where he 'd volunteered			2
@entity101 was not told of the nature of the investigation , which ultimately led to child sex abuse charges			2
unnamed players tell the station that @entity2 was active in the programme			2
' get ready for bulging , bursting pleasure , ' it continues			2
the unorthodox lawyer has already been criticised for the way he has handled the disgraced former coach 's case , which included giving him the green light to do a tv interview with @entity116 's @entity115 and two days of interviews with the @entity118			2
@entity41 insists 67 - year - old @entity2 is not the serial predator described by the grand jury and said that though his methods may be unorthodox , he has a plan			2
he said on saturday : ' i do have a strategy			2
there is a method to my madness			2
this has been a well - thought - out strategy			0
' the lawyers ' blunders will only add to the assumptions of legal experts , who wonder small - town solo practitioners have taken on more than they can handle			0
@entity2 's decision to waive the preliminary hearing came as a shock , as @entity41 previously said this was not an option , believing it to be an ' important opportunity for him to maintain his innocence '			1
shortly after arriving at a packed @entity49 at 8am on tuesday , he and @entity41 and second attorney @entity7 , joined two prosecutors and a court reporter in the judge 's chambers			1
after magistrate judge @entity150 asked @entity2 if he understood he was waiving certain rights , the former coach said yes			0
according to @entity152 , @entity2 briefly paused outside the courthouse afterwards and said : ' we fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do , to stay the course , to fight for four quarters ... we want the opportunity to present our side			1
' when a reporter shouted to him : ' @entity2 , do you still maintain your innocence ? ' , his attorney answered for him saying : ' yes			1
' unbearable : @entity166 , an attorney for victim number four , holds a handwritten letter from his client , which told of going through ' the most difficult time of his life ' leaving : @entity2 and his wife @entity172 sit in a car after departing from a hearing where he waived the right to have a preliminary trial following the decision , @entity177 attorney @entity166 read a statement from his client , who is known as @entity180 which said : ' this is the most difficult time of my life			1
i ca n't put into words how unbearable this has been on my life , both physically and mentally			1
' i ca n't believe they put us through this only to waive the hearing			1
regardless of the decision to waive the hearing , nothing has changed			0
i still will stand my ground and testify the truth			0
' @entity166 told @entity195 live the word ' truth ' was underlined three times by his client , who would have been the first testify on tuesday but was only told of the decision at 8.30am			1
the hearing was expected to last a day or more			0
@entity2 has denied the allegations , which led to the departures of longtime @entity6 football coach @entity63 and the university president			0
' this development we believe provides maximum protection to most importantly the victims in this case , ' said senior deputy attorney general e. @entity209			1
' it avoids their having to testify for a second time			0
they will of course testify at a trial in the case			0
' judgement day : wearing a dark suit and with his wife @entity172 by his side , he arrived at the courthouse where a judge will decide if the case will go to trial attorney : @entity41 , right , talks to reporters after a preliminary hearing to determine if there was enough evidence to hold @entity2 for trial on charges of sexually abusing boys statement : @entity2 himself told reporters afterwards : ' we fully intend to put together the best possible defense that we can do , to stay the course , to fight for four quarters ... we want the opportunity to present our side ' @entity209 said the amount of publicity generated by @entity2 's attorney made the decision unexpected , but said the decision to waive was not unusual given the strength of the state 's case			1
there have been no discussions about a plea bargain , @entity209 said			1
@entity2 's next court appearance , an arraignment , is scheduled for january 11			1
he remains under house arrest			0
@entity256 , a lawyer for one of the accusers , said he was encouraged by the development			0
the accusers ' do not have to relive the horrors they experience up on the witness stand ' by having to testify at the hearing and at trial			0
he also said it may pave the way for a plea deal somewhere down the road but the prosecution said that was not even discussed today			1
@entity2 , in a dark suit , entered the county courthouse through the back door this morning with his wife , @entity172 , at his side			0
he looked straight ahead , ignoring questions from reporters			0
defense attorney @entity277 followed him into the courthouse			1
about 50 members of the media and 10 local residents , a few of them waiting with cameras to take pictures , awaited his arrival			0
witnesses have contended before the grand jury that @entity2 committed a range of sexual offenses against boys as young as 10 , assaulting them in hotel swimming pools , the basement of his home in @entity294 and in the locker room showers at @entity6 , where the 67 - year - old former assistant football coach once built a national reputation as a defensive mastermind			0
pictured : @entity2 's mugshot after he was arrested for a second time on december 7 , left , and arriving at court on tuesday with his wife @entity172 by his side , right repeat : @entity2 was arrested and jailed on december 6 on new child sex abuse charges brought by two new accusers , including one who claims @entity2 molested him numerous times in a basement bedroom the scandal has provoked strong criticism that @entity6 officials did n't do enough to stop @entity2 , and prompted the departures of @entity313 football coach @entity63 and the school 's longtime president , @entity314			2
@entity2 , 67 , has said repeatedly that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the case			0
in interviews with @entity116 and the @entity118 , he said he showered and ' horsed around ' with boys but never sexually abused them			0
@entity2 is free on $ 250,000 bail , but is subject to electronic monitoring and the equivalent of house arrest			0
he also can have no contact with victims or witnesses and have no unsupervised contact with minors			0
last month mr @entity2 told @entity116 's @entity115 and the @entity118 that his relationship to the boys who said he abused them was like that of an extended family			0
mr @entity2 characterized his experiences with the children as ' precious times ' and said the physical aspect of the relationships ' just happened that way ' and did n't involve abuse			2
if the accusers stay true to what was in the grand jury report , the court will hear that @entity2 often showered with them , put his hand on their legs during car rides , and showered them with presents , attention and trips to football games			2
his advances allegedly ranged from soapy bear hugs in the shower to rape in his basement during sleepovers			0
he admits showering with them but denies sexual contact			0
