living in @entity0 or @entity1 may mean you ’re more intelligent than residents of @entity4 and @entity5			1
that 's according to a recent study of reading levels and @entity9 , based on 500,000 @entity11 messages posted by people across the @entity13 the study used a computer algorithm to score tweets based on spelling , grammar and word choice , and found a significant difference in state - by - state intelligence			1
zoom in on a state to find its average reading score based on tweets @entity25 : @entity27 - @entity26 - 5.30 bottom 5 : @entity30 - @entity29 - @entity28 - 4.6 average : 4 @entity4 real - estate group @entity31 has now used this data to create a series of @entity35 interactive maps showing a breakdown of reading level and iq by state , based on the @entity11 feedback overall scores were relatively low , with the majority of states falling between a fourth grade and sixth grade reading level			1
‘ the required brevity of tweets is likely the cause of this , and the comparison of states is the real measurement of interest , ’ said @entity46 , chief economist from @entity31			0
interestingly , state - by - state results seemed to match up to previous official state education performance statistics			1
for example , of the five states that ranked the lowest in grade - level reading ability during the analysis of tweets , four of them also ranked in the top six of worst - educated states in 2011			2
these included @entity27 , @entity65 and @entity66			0

in the @entity85 in @entity86 , which is based on 2009 data , half of those states were listed as a top 10 state for 8th - grade reading proficiency			2
the majority of the states coming up somewhere in the middle , with average scores were located in the west , southwest , midwest , and along the east coast			0
‘ an interesting question which is not explored here would examine the reason behind this correlation , ’ said @entity46			0
‘ are worse writing skills correlated with lower iq scores , are iq tests necessarily biased to the better educated ? ’ the states with the lowest iq were found to be @entity5 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity30 and @entity4			1
somewhat unexpectedly , high - school graduation rates did n’t match up with a state ’s tweeting abilities			0
‘ perhaps there should be a class on incorporating proper grammar , spelling , and word choice into tweets , ’ @entity46 concluded			2

results were revealed in a study of iq levels based on the 500,000 @entity11 messages left by people across @entity13
@entity4 - based study used a computer algorithm to score tweets based on spelling , grammar and word choice
it said the state - by - state results seemed to match up to recent official state education performance statistics
study found most intelligent states are @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity140 , @entity27 and @entity80
the states with the lowest iq were found to be @entity5 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity30 and @entity4
