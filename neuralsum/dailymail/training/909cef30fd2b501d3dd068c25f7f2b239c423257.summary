this week , 18 - month - old @entity6 left @entity7 in @entity8 , for his family home , thanks to a portable ventilator and the hard work of medical staff at three hospitals			1
@entity6 was born five weeks before his due date			1
he survived his premature birth only for medics to discover he had a condition which meant his ribs were suffocating him			2
@entity6 ( pictured with his mother , @entity19 ) , 18 - months , has just been discharged from @entity7 in @entity8 where he has spent his whole life a series of scans revealed he had chest and spinal problems that restricted his breathing and distorted the organs in his chest			1
but after several operations , he has finally gone to live at home in @entity30 , @entity31			2
@entity6 ’ mother , @entity19 , gave birth at the @entity34 , was then transferred to @entity35 and then to @entity7 , where @entity6 has spent almost all of his life			1
the 33 - year - old said : ‘ i went into hospital at 35 weeks and staff said they detected “ reduced activity ” and had to deliver him			1
‘ the whole process only took about 40 minutes from getting in there to the procedure			2
‘ afterwards , they told me that if they had n’t delivered him there and then , he ’d have had 20 minutes to live			2
‘ they had to get him out or he would n’t have survived			0
‘ he was intubated and transferred to @entity35			1
we were there for about 20 days			0
they tried to take him off the ventilator a few times but it just did n’t happen			2
@entity6 was born five weeks before his due date			1
he survived his premature birth only for medics to discover he had a condition which meant his ribs were suffocating him ‘ and it was only meant to be a visit to @entity7 but he ended up staying there for almost 18 months			1
’ ms @entity19 , an administration worker , and her partner @entity66 , 37 , a plumber , found their lives split between @entity30 and @entity8			0
ms @entity19 added : ‘ basically , @entity6 ’ heart was being pushed on to the right side			1
his left lung was small , and his heart was compressing the right lung so he could n’t get enough air			2
‘ they described the problem as life - limiting chest and vertebrae anomalies			1
his ribs were fused in an unusual way			0
‘ the way they described it was that the ribs looked like they were the opposite way round to everybody else 's			0
’ when @entity6 was seven - and - a - half months , medics presented his parents with a stark choice			1
ms @entity19 said : ‘ this is so unusual it was uncharted territory			0
‘ staff at @entity7 wrote to @entity94 in @entity95 to find out if there was anything else they could do - but the answer was no. ms @entity19 said : ' basically , @entity6 ' heart was being pushed on to the right side			1
his left lung was small , and his heart was compressing the right lung so he could n't get enough air			2
@entity6 is pictured with his parents , @entity105 and @entity66 ‘ so they told us the only alternative to a tracheotomy and long - term ventilation was to turn the machine off			1
‘ for us there was no question			0
’ the family opted for long - term ventilation and an action plan was put in place			2
it took six months for @entity7 to put together a care package , which involved training up six staff to handle @entity6 ’ equipment , to allow the little boy to go home			1
ms @entity19 said : ‘ it did n’t seem like it at the time but they said it was the fastest package they ’d ever put together			0
@entity6 ( pictured with his father , @entity66 ) has only been able to go home thanks to a portable ventilator ‘ at the time i was pretty much living in a flat set aside for parents ’ accommodation			1
‘ we wanted to go home			2
it was tiring for us , but we were concerned about @entity6 , too			1
the longer you are in hospital the more vulnerable you are to bugs			0
‘ @entity6 did catch an infection on the ward and he almost died			1
he fought it and pulled through			0
’ returning to their @entity30 home was a relief			2
she said : ‘ it ’s an amazing feeling to know he ’s under the same roof			0
we can wake up and know he ’s in the next room			0
‘ we go back to @entity7 for checks and procedures and he ’s still under their care			1
’ @entity6 may need surgery to open his ribcage up if the bones put more pressure on his organs but he is exceeding every expectation			1
ms @entity19 said : ‘ there were worries the problems could stop him speaking , but it has n’t slowed his development at all and we ’re so grateful for that			0
he ’s taking a few steps but we do n’t know if he ’ll be able to walk in future			0
’ although @entity6 is reliant on the ventilator , he can get out and about and has been on trips to the park and a farmyard			1
ms @entity19 said : ‘ he ’s constantly happy			0
i ’ve never seen a child so happy			0
‘ he loves tv but most of all he wants to play			0
to him it ’s real life			2
he ’ll watch other kids out and about and we know he wants to join in			0
‘ if his breathing tube gets looped around his feet , he just steps out of it			0
he ’s so calm while we ’ll be panicking			0
‘ the doctors are amazed at how he ’s come on			0
‘ but as @entity66 says , we think he ’s going to show everyone			0
