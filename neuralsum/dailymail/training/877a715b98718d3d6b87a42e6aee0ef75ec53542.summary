' " patients , " i call them			2
they open up to me like a therapist , ' she told @entity42			2
' it 's very difficult to describe what i do			1
yesterday i said , " basically , i 'm a clerk " - a very costly clerk for 37 years			1

indeed , in her memoir she describes how president @entity12 came to her to pick up an altered dress for his wife , and she took it upon herself to show him how to carry it correctly			1
' it had just been pressed and finished			2
he took it and wrapped it over his arm like he was taking his shirts to laundry , ' she recalls			0
in the works : not only is her highly - anticipated book about to hit shelves , but she is also working with @entity54 to create a new comedy series based on her life ( pictured together in october ) ' i said , " oh , for @entity99 's sake			1
she ’s going to wear that dress tonight , " she explains			0
' he said , " i ca n't believe @entity32 's telling me how to carry a dress			1
" i said , " at least i ’m not telling you how to run the country			0
" ' the quick - witted octogenarian goes on to say that the pair had ' a wonderful love affair			0
she came out of that dressing room and showed him every dress			0
and his appreciation for her was written all over his face			0
' much of @entity32 's success is due to her ability to adapt to the times - although she ca n't help but remark on how much the fashion world has changed since her youth			1
' we dressed - that 's what 's different , ' she writes			1
' you went to @entity126 on saturday night and tipped the head waiter heavily to get a table			0
you did n't think about going out not dressed			0
' flashback : ' we dressed - that 's what 's different , ' she says of fashion back in her day			1
' you went to @entity126 on saturday night and tipped the head waiter heavily to get a table			0
you did n't think about going out not dressed ' in contrast to the overwhelmingly casual style of today 's population , ' when you went into a store - let 's say @entity141 or @entity142 - you got dressed up , ' she says			1
' you would n't walk around in shorts or tight white pants			0
' indeed , this last trend is one that @entity32 just can not get her head around			0
read all about it : @entity2 's memoir , which costs $ 20 on @entity149 , will be released on thursday ' have you noticed everyone is walking around in tight white pants - large , medium , small ? ' she says			1
' they are so awful			0
i just ca n't wait until people put their coats back on in winter and hide all this provocativeness			1
' thanks to her influential fashion sense and no - nonsense outlook , @entity32 has amassed an endless list of famous friends			2
' @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , ' she rattles off effortlessly			0
' @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 - i do n’t even remember her - @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 - that was something - @entity174 , @entity175			0
these are the people who were great to work with			2
the ones that i did n’t keep a list of were n't so great to work with			0
' but at the heart of it all , she says her job is about more than just doling out style advice			0
' for me , dressing someone well is as divine as helping someone to walk , to see , to smile or to bake a tall , light angel food cake , ' she writes in her typically poetic fashion			0
' you 're probably looking at one of the most satisfied people in the world , ' she adds			2
' i 'm really blessed , i can sit here at 86 and talk to you			0
