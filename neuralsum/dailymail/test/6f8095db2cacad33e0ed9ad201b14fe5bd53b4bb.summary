is this the world ’s safest bike ? its designers certainly think so			1
boasting front and rear lights , rear view mirrors and even a car horn , the team behind the electric @entity6 say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety			2
and perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them			1
called the @entity6 it has a host of features including a roll cage			1
@entity26 ( shown with the bike ) is seeking £ 50,000 of funding on site @entity29			1
the bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor the @entity6 was designed by @entity21 - based @entity26 - son of the famous @entity35 inventor sir @entity34 , whose 1985 @entity37 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop			1
@entity26 will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety - conscious cyclists			2
he is seeking £ 50,000 ( $ 74,000 ) of funding on @entity29 to bring his dream to fruition			1
the price might be a bit much for some , with the non-electric version retailing for £ 2,499 ( $ 3,693 ) , and the full electric version £ 3,499 ( $ 5,170 )			0
both are £ 500 ( $ 740 ) less if bought through @entity29			0
may 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment			0
the bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back , with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike ’s innards			0
it does n’t rely on pedal power alone , but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the @entity69 and 15.5mph in the @entity70			2
‘ in both the @entity69 and the @entity70 you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor ca n’t assist at higher speeds ( by law ) , ’ the team notes on their @entity72			0
the bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back , with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike ’s innards there is a holder for a smartphone on the front so you can keep track of vital stats the controls for the @entity95 250 - watt electric assist motor are located on the handlebars , and provide up to 50 per cent assistance			2
the battery has a range of 50 to 80 miles ( 80 to 130km )			0
the bike is recharged by either removing the battery and recharging it at home , or with an optional electric - car - charging lead			0
at the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors , which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock			1
the @entity6 was designed by @entity21 - based @entity26 - son of the famous @entity35 inventor sir @entity34 , whose 1985 @entity37 bike ( pictured with @entity34 in it ) turned out to be somewhat of a flop at the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors , pictured here , which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock the bike does n’t rely on pedal power alone , but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the @entity69 and 15.5mph in the @entity70			1
‘ in both the @entity69 and the @entity70 you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor ca n’t assist at higher speeds ( by law ) , ’ the team notes on their @entity29 page but @entity26 notes in a video that even all these safety features ‘ wo n’t help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities			1
’ @entity136 says that 65 per cent of all bike fatalities in @entity21 are caused by trucks and buses cutting across cyclists			0
so the team designed a roll cage for the bike , which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle			1
if a truck or bus comes into contact with the bike , it will hit the roll cage first and ensure the cyclist is pushed to relative safety – or at least , that ’s the plan			2
the side of the seat – also detachable – has foam pads to cushion against side impacts , while the shape has apparently being designed with aerodynamics in mind by former @entity161 engineers			0
‘ our dream is to put a million more cyclists on our roads , and therefore take a million cars off them , and to do that we need to give cyclists their safety back , ’ said @entity26			0
whether the bike will prove to be more of a success than his father ’s invention remains to be seen , though .			0
