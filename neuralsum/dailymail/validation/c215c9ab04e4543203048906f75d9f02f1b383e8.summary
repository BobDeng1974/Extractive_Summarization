an illegal immigrant was sliced to death by a ferry 's ' machete - like ' propellor after launching a bid for freedom across the @entity6 to avoid deportation			1
albanian @entity8 , 24 , plunged to his death alongside fellow countryman @entity10 , 27 , after jumping from one of the world 's largest ferries , minutes after it had taken off from @entity16 shores			1
the pair were said to be ' tantalisingly close ' to the port in @entity19 , @entity20 , when they decided to launch themselves into the sea			1
albanian @entity8 , 24 , and fellow countryman @entity10 , 27 , plunged to their deaths after jumping from one of the world 's largest ferries , the @entity28 ( pictured ) , while being deported from the @entity16 an inquest heard how the pair , who were being taken to @entity32 , were just 500 metres from the port - but that even an @entity34 swimmer would have struggled to swim through the currents			1
the incident , which took place in february last year , came after the pair had arrived in the @entity16 with 13 other stowaways hidden in the back of a lorry on a freight ferry			1
they were believed to be part of a group which had broken into the vehicle without the driver 's knowledge			2
after today 's hearing , the coroner said the incident was part of ' a bigger picture on immigration and how it 's handled '			1
the inquest heard how the vehicle had been randomly selected for x-ray as it entered the port six hours earlier			2
after @entity61 checks , all but two women were sent back on the @entity63 9am ferry the same day to the @entity64			1
but , at around 10am , it was reported to the captain that two immigrants had jumped from the ship			1
the inquest heard how an eyewitness saw them jump from the railings on the side of the ship before resurfacing briefly then disappearing back into the water			2
but despite an extensive search involving 21 vessels and two helicopters , neither man was rescued			1
mr @entity79 , who died from drowning , was found on march 20 , 2014 , washed up on a beach in @entity82			1
he was identified by fingerprints taken during his deportation by @entity86 agents			2
mr @entity8 's badly decomposed body was found floating in the @entity6 on april 29 , 2014 , and could only be identified by @entity88 from his mother in @entity90			1
the two men had been deported from @entity92 , @entity20 , to @entity32 when they decided to jump into the @entity6			1
a huge search operation was launched but neither man was found alive inspector @entity95 , from @entity96 , told the inquest that the sea would have appeared deceptively calm , instilling a false belief that it would be possible to swim to shore			1
but even if they had not been sucked under the ship , they were unlikely to have survived fierce competing tides , he said			2
' to swim to land with those tides and the water temperature would have been nigh - on impossible - an @entity34 swimmer would have struggled , ' he added			2
mr @entity95 said a tide heading out to sea at about four knots met another northerly tide at about the point where the men jumped			1
this , combined with a sea temperature of about 7c , meant the conditions were virtually unsurvivable , he said			2
' it may have been that the were used to warmer and less tidal waters in their home country and this gave them a false sense of security that they could make it , ' he added			2
@entity127 , senior officer with @entity86 at @entity92 , revealed that the men had been part of a routine deportation and immigrants , during which they are treated like ordinary passengers on the return journey and not put in handcuffs			0
he said : ' this is not a case of being marched on in handcuffs			0
' during the process , neither offered any verbal or physical resistance to being moved onto the vessel			0
' he added that the organisation saw ' a lot of these particular cases '			0
' the same people will turn up two or three times , ' he said			0
' we have individuals this year who are already on their second attempt and it is only march			0
it 's a carousel system			0
' @entity154 dr @entity153 , who performed a post-mortem examination on mr @entity8 , described his injuries saying : ' this was a very forceful cut across the vertebrae by a sharp , curved blade			1
' it is the sort of injury you would get from a machete			0
' this would be quite compatible with the sharp blade of a propeller			0
' coroner @entity168 recorded a conclusion that both men died accidental deaths			0
she said : ' on face value it is easy to conceive of a situation where they jumped off the ferry in their desperation intending to drown , but there is no evidence of that			1
' the evidence suggests they were intending to swim back to @entity183 , something that they could see was tantalisingly close to them			0
' in fact they did not know about the effect of a moving ship on somebody who jumps over the side , and they were sucked underneath			0
' mrs @entity168 said it was difficult to make recommendations to the government based on this case			0
' this is all part of a bigger picture on immigration and how it 's handled , and nothing i could say could help prevent such sad deaths in future , ' she added			0
the @entity63 is one of the largest @entity205 in the world and can cater for up to 1,200 passengers			0
speaking after the hearing , mr @entity10 's cousin , @entity208 , 33 , from north @entity209 , said the case highlighted the plight of many other immigrants he added : ' they had come to the @entity16 for better a life and it seems they were determined to stay			1
' we heard that they were n't escorted on board the ship so there was always a risk this would happen - if i was in that position i would have done the same			0
' there are lots of people in the same situation and they are just desperate			0
' i think there should be better security to stop this happening because they 're not just immigrants , they are people too			0
