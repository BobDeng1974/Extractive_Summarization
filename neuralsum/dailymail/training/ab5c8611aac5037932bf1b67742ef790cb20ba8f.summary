by @entity0 when nobleman sir @entity2 built @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , in the 1660s , it was not only the most desirable dwelling in the vicinity – it was pretty much the only one			1
@entity10 of open fields stretched out from the house in all directions , dotted with only the odd farm dwelling			1
back then , @entity15 was a small weaving town miles away			0
fast - forward 400 years and the urban sprawl of @entity15 has engulfed what had been countryside right up to the doorstep of this grand old manor house			1
@entity24 home : @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , was built in the 1660s and now stands rather majestically in a cul - de - sac of modern housing @entity3 now stands rather majestically in a cul - de - sac of modern housing after what remaining land that belonged to the house was sold by a developer in the early 1980s			1
the five - bedroom , four - reception room house is now on the market for £ 375,000 after its owner , businessman @entity36 , died in 2011			1
it has been left to his brothers @entity38 and @entity40 to sell the property			0
this , as @entity38 admits , is not a straightforward task			0
while @entity3 may be steeped in history – @entity45 is believed to have stayed in the house during the @entity48 rebellion of the 1740s – it is not to everyone ’s taste			1
for a start , the house will need a substantial renovation to render it fit for what most would consider modern living			1
@entity36 not only avoided updating it – he positively revelled in its period charms , keeping its primitive central heating system and filling it with old furniture and artworks			0
so @entity38 and @entity40 have opted to sell this historic property using the modern method – an internet estate agent , emoov.co.uk			0
‘ it can be difficult selling a house like this as it requires a very niche buyer , ’ says @entity38			1
‘ we wanted to spread our net as wide as possible to find one			0
beamed in : @entity76 is selling the 17th @entity78 listed home on behalf of his dead brothers estate ‘ the trouble with going to a local estate agent is that everyone around @entity4 knows about this property as it ’s the oldest and possibly the most famous for miles around			1
’ @entity85 of emoov.co.uk , which launched in 2010 with a grant from @entity89 ’ @entity91 ’s @entity90 , believes his company is ideal for vendors such as the @entity94			0
‘ we guarantee extensive coverage both nationally and internationally so they have certainly spread the net with us in their search for that niche buyer			0
‘ the difference between us and traditional local estate agents is that properties with us will appear on all of the property - search websites – @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , the lot			2
most traditional agents put their properties on only one and spend the rest of their marketing money on advertising in local newspapers			0
what ’s more , i can afford to spend more on marketing as i do n’t have to spend money on high street premises as traditional agents do – we have two offices to cater for our entire operation			0
’ these lower overheads also offer an attractive bonus for vendors using emoov.co.uk			0
rather than charging people selling a percentage of the property ’s sale price , emoov charges a flat fee of £ 395 plus vat , whatever the price			2
@entity136 says the firm recently facilitated the sale of a property in @entity141 ’s fashionable @entity140 for £ 3.15 million but the vendors paid only £ 395 plus vat			2
memories : a marking on the old house from 1663 adds further to the historical feel of the property there is one drawback – emoov does not send representatives to oversee viewings of properties			2
the vendors must show prospective buyers around themselves			0
it does , however , offer mortgage advice , conveyancing referrals and information on the local area around properties for sale			0
@entity76 is more than happy to do the viewings of @entity3			1
he is particularly keen to point out the features of greatest historical interest , such as the chunky original lock and key in the original timber back door , which he gleefully demonstrates is still in fine working order			0
inscriptions dating from the house ’s early days in the 1660s on a flagstone in the garden and on an oak beam above the front door also catch the eye			1
and @entity38 enthuses about a supposed secret passage from the house to a local church – though neither he nor his brother has discovered its whereabouts			2
upstairs , via the original solid - oak staircase , @entity38 points out the only room his brother modernised : the bathroom			1
but since this work looks likely to have been carried out soon after @entity36 bought the house for £ 120,000 in 1992 , new owners will probably want this room redecorated first , as it looks simply dated rather than historical			1
@entity38 stresses that though the house is @entity192 listed , new owners can change anything as long as it does not alter the structure of the property			2
certain areas of the ceiling on the upper floor will require immediate attention , and even those wishing to maintain the historical spirit of the house will undoubtedly want to modernise the kitchen			2
with its low ceilings , original oak beams , solid internal doors and leaded windows , @entity3 will appeal to someone – but they will have to have a taste for the historical without requiring the services of a traditional estate agent			1
