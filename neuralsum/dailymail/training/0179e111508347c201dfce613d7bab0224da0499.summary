@entity0 wanted its money back - hundreds of millions of dollars of it - but a federal judge said wednesday that the oil giant must stick by its agreement with the companies it compensated for business losses due to the 2010 @entity10 oil spill			1

fraudulent ? @entity0 argued that a flawed funding formula enabled many to collect on questionable claims -- and that they should be forced to return the money @entity23 district judge @entity22 agreed several weeks ago to change the formula for any future payments , but he ruled wednesday that a deal is a deal when it comes to the money @entity0 has already paid out			1
under that deal , claimants agreed not to sue the oil company , and @entity0 company agreed that no future court action could change their payments			1
the ruling thwarts @entity0 's latest attempt to control its soaring liability from the spill , which may be nearing $ 50 billion			1
@entity22 said he would rule later on the issue of compensation for cleanup workers whose chronic medical problems were n't diagnosed until after the deal 's cutoff date of april 16 , 2012			2
the settlement entitled cleanup workers with chronic conditions including rashes and breathing problems to receive up to $ 60,700 if the problems first surfaced within days of their cleanup work			0
messy : a judge ruled that businesses do not have to pay back @entity0 the money			2

' @entity0 is still facing a financial nightmare from the nation 's worst oil disaster , which began with an explosion that tore open the oil company 's @entity90 well on the floor of the @entity10 , destroying the @entity94 drilling rig and killing 11 workers			2
just as the company struggled to contain the spill over the following weeks and months , it 's now trying to contain its estimated liability			0
the @entity100 - based company told shareholders at one point that its total exposure would be $ 40 billion , and markets responded accordingly			0
the estimate is now close to $ 50 billion , including more than $ 27 billion that @entity0 says it has already paid to settle damage claims , and the company 's stock price has suffered			1
the @entity90 explosion fouled fruitful seafood grounds , sensitive coastal marshes and tourist - friendly beaches			0
