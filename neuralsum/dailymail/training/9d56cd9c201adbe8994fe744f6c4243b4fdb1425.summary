' i enjoy the human - to - human intimate connection			2
despite being posed up for only 20 minutes , some of the models found being a naked human canvass a little intimidating			2
' some people are uncomfortable when they are first nude in front of others , ' added @entity6			2
' i try to be gentle and talk through things with each person and work with their levels of comfort so they feel safe			0
' but when you 're in a room full of 16 other nude people you get over your fears pretty quickly			0
' it becomes more normal to be the nude person than the one with their clothes still on , so peer pressure works in my favor in those instances			0
' before and after : the models take their positions on a dry run , left , before the stunning final shot is taken bending over backwards for art : @entity6 was promoting her partnership with a charity that works with young women in @entity17 to improve their lives the @entity76 is hoping the series of striking images will raise awareness for beyond the @entity14 after she dedicated the work to them			1

' many young girls are either sold into slavery to pay off family debts or married off as young as age eight			0
' women are responsible for all the hard labor and domestic duties of the house - 75 % of women do not read or write			0
' beyond the @entity14 has created a solution to create internet cafes that the girls can run , bringing money to their families and simultaneously allowing them a chance to get an education online and use the internet as a tool for jobs or to launch entrepreneurial ventures			0
