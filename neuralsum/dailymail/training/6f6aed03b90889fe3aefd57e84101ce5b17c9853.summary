by @entity0 @entity1 was anxious			2
as a 27 - year - old tv presenter he 'd been chosen as the first face to be seen on the eagerly anticipated new @entity5 channel			1
it was the night of 20 april , 1964 , and he was due on screen in little more than half an hour , at 7.20pm			1
after rehearsing all day for his historic role that would inaugurate the first challenge to @entity11 and the @entity5 's single channel , his stomach was churning and every nerve jangled			1
@entity14 , @entity14 ' i was in the studio trying to find a way to relax , ' he recalls now			2
' suddenly it went black			2
@entity19 ! it was as though someone , somewhere , had suddenly switched everything off			2
' a fire at @entity25 's @entity24 had cut all power to a huge swathe of the western side of the capital , including @entity30			1
@entity31 was able to switch to emergency recorded programmes from its @entity34 studio in @entity25 , which was unaffected by the power cut			1
but what about @entity5 ? the channel - heavily promoted over several weeks by a cartoon kangaroo called hullabaloo and her joey custard - was due to begin with @entity1 introducing a collection of previews called @entity44 , followed by variety acts , a production of @entity47 's @entity48 and a firework display from @entity50			1
' nobody knew if the power would be restored quickly , or if we 'd be kicking our heels for hours , ' says @entity1 , now 77			1
' the waiting did n't help our frayed nerves			2
' at @entity58 everyone was in the dark - literally			2
' my editor , @entity59 , rushed in , ' remembers @entity1			2
' i asked , " what can we do ? " he shrugged and said , " not much			2
" we waited in the studio for an hour - and - a - half in the hope that the power might come back on			1
' @entity65 and @entity66 in @entity67 , one of @entity5 's most successful launches it was during this interlude that @entity1 overheard an astonishing conversation between two unnamed @entity5 executives in the darkened studio			1
they were blaming @entity11 for deliberately sabotaging the new channel 's opening			2
nine years earlier , in september 1955 , the launch of @entity11 had been upstaged by a deliberate @entity5 spoiler - the fictional death in a fire of @entity82 , a stalwart of radio 's @entity83 , an event which made front page news			1
' one of the executives was saying that the @entity24 power cut was @entity11 's revenge for @entity82 , ' says @entity1			1
he said , " it 's all too much of a coincidence			2
how did @entity82 die ? in a fire			0
what scuppered @entity5 ? a fire			1
" â € ‰ ' the sabotage theory was soon discounted , however			0
@entity25 @entity11 station @entity97 generously offered to transmit @entity5 's programmes , but because they 'd have to wait until the @entity11 schedules finished for the night , this was declined			1
@entity1 says , ' we finally decided that if power had n't come back by 9.45 we 'd abandon everything and start @entity5 the following night			1
' the presenter , who was recruited for the launch from @entity106 , went home deeply depressed			2
' i remember thinking i 've come all the way over from @entity110 to make my name and look what happened , ' he says			0
by next morning the power lines were back in service , and in spite of all the grand plans for the original launch , the first scheduled programme shown was @entity119 at 11am			1
a second launch took place exactly 24 hours after the aborted show			2
at 7.20pm on tuesday , 21 april , cameras focused on a darkened studio with a candle burning on a desk			0
it was the infant @entity5 - at last			1
@entity1 says , ' right on cue , i walked into shot and picked up the candle			0
as the lights came up , i blew it out and said , " good evening			0
this is the studio from which @entity5 programmes will start each evening from now on			1
' ' suddenly it went black			0
@entity19 ! it was as though someone , somewhere , had suddenly switched everything off			0
' now , half a century after that disastrous night , @entity5 is making up for it by celebrating the anniversary			1
a cornucopia of special programmes are being planned			0
@entity148 , a former @entity5 controller , and @entity14 will be among the pioneers taking part			1
' @entity148 was the most innovative of all , ' says @entity1 , who cites @entity153 's introduction of @entity154 , @entity155 , rugby league and one - day cricket			0
' he was always very supportive			0
during his term i was chairing a @entity160 discussion about @entity162 comedy			0
@entity164 writer @entity163 and comic @entity165 arrived very drunk , and it was difficult to shut @entity163 up			0
meanwhile , comedy writer @entity167 had been in the @entity5 bar but had n't been invited to take part in the programme			1
he burst into the studio shouting , " s * * the viewers " , and had to be restrained by staff			0
the show went out live and i was told in my earpiece by the director to keep going for as long as i thought i should			0
' afterwards i got a call from @entity153 , my boss			0
" i 've only one question , " he said			0
" how many drinks did we give @entity163 and @entity165 ? " i said none			0
" ok , fine , " he said			0
" but there 's going to be trouble			0
and , by the way , i think you should go and have a drink yourself now			0
" ' it was @entity148 who introduced colour in 1967			0
he says he needed a prestigious series to showcase the new format			0
' i wanted to show all the loveliest things human beings have made in @entity197 in the last 1,000 years , accompanied by the loveliest contemporary music , ' he explains			2
the result was the @entity201 triumph civilisation , now to be remade by the @entity5			1
@entity148 , a former @entity5 controller , will take part in a selection special programmes to celebrate @entity5 's anniversary however , @entity148 was critical of @entity5 when it celebrated its 40th anniversary			1
' i am not in need of visual chewing gum , ' he said then			0
' i do n't watch soaps , and @entity210 and thingy are not going to affect the kind of cardigan i wear			0
the @entity5 output has certainly changed and not towards my taste			1
' dame @entity14 agrees that @entity5 has changed			1
' it does n't live up to its pioneering times			0
' her arrival there , in the summer of 1964 , created an immediate sensation			0
' to have a woman as one of the four presenters on @entity160 was exceptional , ' she says			0
' it was the late ( comedy writer ) @entity224 who named me the @entity227 , which has taken me a lifetime to live down			0
it was meant as a compliment , but it was a little bit of a put - down , although i could n't mind			0
' that disastrous launch night could n't hold @entity5 back , and it went on to broadcast ground - breaking shows from @entity235 to @entity67 , @entity236 , have i got news for you and @entity239			1
more recently @entity5 has introduced @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242			1
' the lesson of the power failure was " no mistake , no publicity , big mistake , big publicity " , ' says @entity249 , the inaugural controller of @entity5			1
' only 7 per cent of viewers could receive the channel at the time			2
had the launch gone smoothly , the nation may not have known @entity5 had gone on the air			1
as it was , everybody knew we had n't ! ' @entity5 's 50th anniversary celebrations begin with @entity259 tonight at 10pm .			1

despite being a successful tv channel , @entity5 had a rocky start
the night the channel was due to launch they had a power cut
now the channel will celebrate its 50th years on air
