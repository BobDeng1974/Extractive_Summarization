they could have lost @entity1 it would not have been irreparable			2
@entity3 the same ; maybe even @entity4			2
the moment it became plain that @entity8 ’s future in @entity10 football was untenable , handling life without a player who close to propelled @entity13 to a first league title of the modern era , was going to take all the skill @entity17 and his boardroom financiers could muster			1
the same task has eaten up three managers in a year at @entity21 , and they are still no further forward			1
managers will say that it is good business to lose one stellar name and rebuild a team			0
yes , but there are exceptions			0
when that player is so far above the rest it makes compensatory dealing close to impossible			0
that is what @entity21 have found , losing @entity35			1
@entity13 are now facing the same painful facts @entity36			1
@entity38 and @entity13 manager @entity17 back in training the morning after the night before @entity38 on the ball on thursday morning - but it was on wednesday night that @entity13 could have done with him stepping up @entity38 once again proved to @entity13 fans that he is not the answer to the problem created by @entity8 's departure trudging off , head down , said everything you needed to know about @entity38 's 45 minutes against @entity48 it is not that their buys have been so bad : they just do n’t amount to one @entity8			1
@entity21 ’s are n’t wholesale duds either			1
they just ca n’t add up to the match - winning quality of @entity35 at his best			1
@entity13 could have restructured around the loss of , say , @entity1			1
he is a good player , among the best strikers in the @entity58 , but with £ 30m to spend , @entity13 could have made the necessary improvements to the team , while retaining the talent that made it all tick			1
@entity8 would have continued winning and defining matches , while the likes of @entity66 settled in			1
that is how it works			0
@entity69 was a fine player for @entity70 , but not so influential that he was irreplaceable			0
and with the inflated fee from @entity72 , @entity70 were able to make upgrades throughout the group			0
but @entity38 soon angered the home support and guaranteed a few more headlines by swapping shirts with @entity78 @entity38 and @entity78 exchanged jerseys as the players made their way down the tunnel for half - time the ' @entity85 ' top - while playing for @entity84 three years ago - was another shirt that landed @entity38 in hot water @entity38 's heat map against @entity48 did n't cover him in glory most @entity58 managers endorse this policy of renewal			1
most have little choice , really			0
@entity94 lose @entity95 but can invest in the likes of @entity97 and @entity98 and have loose change for the sundries			0
@entity95 was good but not so good that his loss could not be more than compensated for by the addition of others			0
any other @entity13 player , perhaps even the aging , talismanic @entity4 , would fit into that category , too			1
@entity72 could cover the absence of @entity108 , @entity109 , even @entity110 : but not @entity111			0
not that @entity13 had too many options once @entity8 had bitten @entity113 at the @entity114			1
banned from club football until late october – he will play for @entity117 for the first time this weekend and , initially , his suspension was from all form of football activity , so it was thought he would not be back that quickly – his status in the @entity10 game made it close to impossible for him to continue			2
@entity13 ’s mistake was in not learning from @entity21 ’s expensive agonies			1
buying in bulk was not the solution			0
they needed to pick off specific problem areas with individuals of the highest quality			0
at @entity133 on wednesday they had nobody operating at the level of @entity111 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 or @entity139			0
they had the notch down ; the wannabes			0
think of how @entity143 improved this summer			0
@entity13 finished above @entity143 last season			1
they did n’t require a whole new team of good players			0
they needed better defenders , yes , but also a sprinkling of greatness			0
even without @entity8 would they be in retreat right now with @entity144 and @entity145 in the team ? @entity138 and @entity136 ? even @entity158 and @entity159 ? @entity160 played well and @entity161 tried his hardest but @entity13 did not have anyone who looked capable of hurting @entity48 on wednesday night			1
less could have been more , if spent wisely			0
and they had more to offer than @entity21 when losing @entity35 , too			1
they had @entity166 football and a great name and pedigree			0
@entity21 without @entity35 were a hard sell ; @entity13 offered the prestige and the stage , even if @entity8 would no longer be sharing it			1
some lousy breaks are beyond policy , of course			0
@entity1 has been injured since september			0
having lost @entity8 , that is a huge blow , but the late acquisition of @entity38 has compounded the problem			1
swapping shirts at half - time was the least of it against @entity48			1
@entity38 merited early withdrawal even before it became known that he was exchanging memorabilia with the opposition , when he should have been snarling in their direction , promising revenge			1
@entity38 did not get into scoring positions and his passes lacked care			1
when one went awry his default reaction was to display his displeasure with an unworthy team - mate , although the numbers in that category are now stacking up alarmingly as @entity38 bounces between a succession of major clubs in @entity197			1
@entity8 swapping @entity133 for @entity117 left @entity13 manager @entity17 with a problem to solve in his attack @entity21 have n't managed to replace @entity35 since he left @entity201 for @entity48 in a world - record £ 86m move last year @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity84 ; @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208			1
all have decided @entity38 ’s maintenance was a bill they could no longer afford			2
what possessed @entity17 to think his methods held the secret to unlocking his genius and setting it loose ? ego			0
the comedian @entity216 said that if @entity217 came to earth he would have no trouble finding a partner because women everywhere would think they could change him			0
“ but he ’s the @entity222			0
” “ you do n’t know him like i do			0
” it ’s the same with managers			0
@entity226 makes them think they hold the key			0
@entity17 got great performances , and behaviour , out of @entity8 last season and perhaps he thought he could juggle fire again			2
@entity143 bought well in the summer , bringing in @entity234 internationals @entity145 ( left ) and @entity144 @entity235 , who has a reasonable record with difficult characters , fancied his chances with @entity239			0
ultimately , he scraped a @entity58 place with @entity241 in a play - off , as @entity239 sat on the sidelines , unusable			2
@entity13 have been forced by circumstance to rely on @entity38 and the £ 16m bargain is looking anything but			1
it is three years to the day since @entity38 asked ‘ why always me ’ and it is fair to say the fireworks have fizzled out			2
a cut - price transfer market masterstroke he is not			2
there is too much moneyball at @entity13			2
too many attempts to marry cute value to the project , when replacing a player of @entity8 ’s influence and quality required grandly conventional thinking			2
indeed , @entity8 ’s presence may have been all that would have saved the @entity38 transfer			1
the new man ’s work - rate is an issue yet it would be hard to not put in a shift when the best player in the team is dogging left , right and into his own half to win the ball			2
@entity13 had nobody on the same level as @entity111 as they went down 3 - 0 to @entity48 on wednesday night @entity1 has never worked harder than in tandem with @entity8			1
how could he do less , given the phenomenal effort of the @entity275 ? @entity38 ’s posing simply would not have been tolerated with @entity8 around			1
in this way , at least , he was a magnificent example			0
it is not too late for revival this season , @entity13 are fifth after all , level on points with fourth - place @entity284 who few are tipping to maintain a @entity166 place			1
around this time last year , though even if the results could still be random – @entity13 lost 3 - 1 to @entity289 in december and were beaten at home by @entity70 in september – there were significant signs that @entity17 had the team going in the right direction			1
there is little hint of year - on - year improvement now			2
@entity13 can still make the last 16 of the @entity166 , or qualify for it next year through league position , but there are growing fears a return may prove beyond them			2
undoubtedly they have not improved and , right now , do not appear title contenders			0
without @entity8 this transition was always going to be hard			2
it did not , however , have to be as tough as this			0
@entity21 ’s struggles should have served as a warning , not a blueprint			2
@entity311 laments first - half showing			2

@entity314 striker @entity38 has been a *massive* *failure* since arriving at @entity13 in a £ 16m move from @entity205
@entity13 losing @entity8 was like @entity21 losing @entity35 - the star men have not been replaced
@entity38 was terrible against @entity48 and angered fans , *ex-players* and his boss by swapping shirts at half - time
the former @entity84 forward has scored just once since returning to @entity326 - against @entity327
