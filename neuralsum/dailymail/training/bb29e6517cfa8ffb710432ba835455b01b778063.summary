@entity0 remain the largest religious group in the world despite their population migrating from @entity4 to @entity5 , @entity6 and the @entity7 according to a new study			1
around one - quarter of the world 's @entity0 's @entity10 today compared to two - thirds a century ago according to a study compiled by the @entity13 based in @entity14 the research showed that @entity5 has seen the biggest increase in its @entity0 population over the past century , going from about nine million @entity0 in 1910 to about 516 million today			1
@entity18 remains the world 's most dominant religion despite only one - quarter living in @entity4			1
picture : the @entity22 in @entity23 countries with the largest number of @entity0 are the @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
the study 's author 's said @entity27 has twice as many @entity34 as @entity35 , while @entity36 has double the number of @entity38 as @entity39 , where the @entity40 began , author 's of the study said			0
however , even despite the movement of the @entity0 population to different parts of the globe it is still the world 's dominant religion with nearly 2.2billion followers			1
@entity48 is the world 's second - largest religion with about 1.6 billion people or slightly less than a quarter of the global population following the faith			1
@entity0 attend a service in @entity54 , @entity27 which is home to one of the world 's largest populations of the faith the @entity18 report was compiled using national censuses , population surveys and estimates from church groups of numbers attending services			2
the data was compared to surveys taken in 1910 including data from the @entity69 for the @entity70 at @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73			0
@entity4 may have been the mainland for @entity0 a century ago but researchers said that the population is now so widely spread across the world that no specific region can be described as the centre of the faith			1
this has been a concern for @entity83 leaders for many years who have been tasked with trying to build stronger ties with fellow believers across the geographical boundaries and reconcile differing interpretations of the @entity88			0
young boys take part in a @entity92 service at a @entity34 in @entity93 @entity94 , demographer at the @entity96 and lead researcher for the @entity18 report , told @entity98 : ' we set out to provide data on the number of @entity0 around the world as part of a series of reports focusing on the global populations of major religious groups			0
' as we note in the report , there is no single region or continent that is indisputably the centre of global @entity18 anymore '			0
the smallest concentration of @entity0 can be found in @entity113 - where the faith began - and where they make up only about four per cent of the population today			2
@entity117 has the largest @entity0 population in the region , with about 4.3 million @entity0 who have been victims of violence specifically since the fall of president @entity122			0
about five per cent of @entity124 's population or 67 million people are @entity0 , according to the study 's authors			2
it is difficult to be accurate , however when estimating @entity124 's @entity0 population due to the mixture of government - sanctioned churches and grassroots operating illegally across the country .			2

only one - quarter of world 's population remain in @entity4 as followers spread across @entity6 , @entity5 and @entity7
two - thirds of the flock were in @entity4 100 years ago
