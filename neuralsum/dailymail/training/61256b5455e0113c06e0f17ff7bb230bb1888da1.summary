@entity1 radio dj @entity0 has been named as the woman alleged to have made threatening phone calls to a male colleague who committed suicide last month			1
detectives last week launched an inquiry to help the coroner discover why @entity9 , 50 , suffocated himself			2
his family claim he was driven to his death after @entity1 bosses failed to take seriously allegations that he had been offended by a female colleague five years ago			2
claims : @entity17 's father @entity16 alleges that @entity1 dj @entity0 made threatening calls to his son however @entity20 has been unable to substantiate these allegations			1
the identity of the woman has so far remained a secret and ms @entity0 has not responded to repeated requests from @entity20 to talk about the matter			1
but both sources at the @entity1 and mr @entity9 ’s father , a former chief constable , have identified ms @entity0 as the woman linked to the @entity32 police investigation			1
the news adds to the pressure on the @entity1			2
ms @entity0 , now a dj on @entity1 digital station 6 music , recently claimed she was routinely groped by male colleagues when she worked at @entity39 in the @entity40			1
she spoke out in the wake of revelations about @entity43			0
mr @entity9 , who as a reporter at @entity45 and @entity32 , is believed to have received a series of phone messages from ms @entity0 after they argued during a meal out together in 2007 and he apparently walked out on her in a restaurant , leaving her to find her own way back to @entity45			1
the phone messages branded him a ‘ flake ’ and ‘ a loser ’			0
distressed : @entity1 broadcast journalist @entity9 suffocated himself ms @entity0 , now 54 , worked at @entity45 and @entity32 between 2005 and 2011			1
while there is no evidence that the messages contributed to the death of mr @entity9 , who was being treated in a psychiatric hospital when he died , his family claim that he was left ‘ a shadow of his former self ’ because he felt bosses failed to act on his complaints			1
the @entity1 has launched an investigation , but the family are demanding a fully independent inquiry			2
mr @entity9 ’s father @entity16 , 77 , the retired chief constable of @entity32 , said last night : ‘ when @entity0 joined @entity45 and @entity32 she did not know the area and for some reason @entity9 was chosen to show her around			1
‘ he quite enjoyed it , i think , until this particular incident but after that life became very tough for him			0
‘ we have the recordings of what she said to him			0
@entity9 , being a good reporter , actually recorded the messages as they were being left			2
‘ they were very unpleasant and she made it clear that she felt she was on a different level to him			0
a lot of things happened because he had to carry on working with her			0
he did not tell us everything but it badly affected him			0
‘ he was contracted to read the news on her show and told some of his friends about how she had cut him off and that sort of thing			0
it changed the way he felt about the @entity1			2
’ @entity95 , who led the @entity32 force for 15 years , added : ‘ he had a bad episode earlier in the year			2
we thought he had recovered , but after a discussion with senior people at the @entity1 he thought there was no hope of obtaining justice			2
a few days later he killed himself			0
‘ the discussion between @entity9 and the @entity1 happened a week before he died			1
i do n’t know what part the @entity43 business played in @entity9 ’s mind but he followed the news			1
‘ @entity9 was a character , the last person many of his friends would have thought this would happen to			2
but he was a reporter to the end and this is the last story for him			0
his last act was to make sure people knew the reason			0
he did not leave a letter but there are so many ways of getting your message out these days			0
‘ until now , i have felt sick in the stomach because nobody was allowed to say who it was that @entity9 had been talking about			2
’ when asked if he had given @entity0 ’s name to police , mr @entity9 replied : ‘ we did speak to the police about this in the early stages			1
i know they have all the facts and the names of those involved			0
’ @entity9 is though to have spoken to the @entity1 occupational health department about the case this spring , when he was off work with stress			1
according to reports , one of the phone messages sent to mr @entity9 said : ‘ thanks for abandoning me			1
do n’t ever ever think of me as your mate again			0
do what you have to at the @entity1 cause you are a loser on 27 grand a year			0
but do n’t ever encroach on me or my talent			0
’ another message said : ‘ you are flaky , you are poor , you are weak			0
i do n’t want anything to do with you except on the radio			0
’ a third said : ‘ do n’t ever , ever presume friendship with me again , all right ? goodbye			0
’ the allegation that ms @entity0 , made the calls to mr @entity9 came after she claimed last month there was a culture of sexual harassment of women at @entity39 and that she was groped while broadcasting live			1
ms @entity0 , who worked for @entity39 in the @entity40 , met @entity1 director - general @entity154 after she claimed on @entity156 ’s today programme that an unidentified male colleague had repeatedly stroked her breasts while she was on air			1
anger : @entity9 's father ex police chief @entity95 has blamed @entity163 bosses for failing to stop his death she said : ‘ there was a reporter who routinely groped me			1
i would be sitting in the studio with my headphones on and my back to the studio door			0
i could n’t say anything , i could n’t even explain because i was broadcasting to the nation			0
’ a @entity1 spokesman refused to be drawn on ms @entity0 ’s involvement in the matter			1
he said : ‘ it would be inappropriate to comment on names or specific details until all the facts are known but the @entity1 is committed to working constructively with the family to ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed			0
‘ what we can say is that we are undertaking an investigation overseen by an external professional to establish the facts about how any complaints made by @entity9 were reported and how the @entity1 acted on them			1
we will also co-operate fully with the coroner ’s inquest which is charged with determining the cause of @entity9 ’s death and will consider its findings carefully ’			1
when approached by @entity20 yesterday ms @entity0 declined to comment .			1
