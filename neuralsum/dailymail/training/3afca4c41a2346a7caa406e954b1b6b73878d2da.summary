@entity1 scientists encouraged 20 obese people to eat extra fast food for several months , and found that about a quarter stayed in good health despite the additional pounds they gained			1
the study in the january 2 edition of the @entity7 was led by a team of scientists at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			0
subjects were encouraged to eat 1,000 extra calories per day , mainly by frequenting fast food restaurants with the goal of adding six percent of their body weight			1
the study involved 20 obese participants who were asked to gain about 15 pounds over several months to determine how the extra pounds affected their metabolic functions			1
research participants were asked to consume 1,000 extra calories every day until each gained 6 percent of his or her body weight ' this was not easy to do , ' said chief author @entity39 , assistant professor of medicine			1
it is just as difficult to get people to gain weight as it is to get them to lose weight , ' those not suffering from ailments typically associated with obesity at the outset of the study - such as insulin resistance , high cholesterol , high blood pressure and excess liver fat - did not have these problems even after adding about 15 pounds ( seven kilograms ) to their already overweight frames , said the findings			2
the results mirror what scientists have seen in the general population , which is that about a quarter of obese people do not appear to suffer from metabolic complications that can lead to heart attack , diabetes and stroke			1
but those whose did suffer from metabolic problems before the study grew even worse when they put on extra weight			2
all the research subjects were helped by dieticians to lose the weight they gained for the study , which was featured on @entity75 's documentary ' @entity73 ' while the research was under way			0
study authors said they now understand better how to distinguish obese people who will be more prone to ill health from those who may be more protected			1
for instance , those with abnormal metabolisms accumulated fat in their livers , while the healthier people did not , even when they gained more weight			2
' another difference involved gene function in fat tissue , ' the university said in a statement			0
the study found that overweight people with normal metabolisms had more fat - regulating genes			2
' the activity of those genes increased even more when the metabolically normal people gained weight			2
that was n't true for people with abnormal metabolism , ' the study found			0
the results mirror what scientists have seen in the general population , which is that about a quarter of obese people do not appear to suffer from metabolic complications that can lead to heart attack , diabetes and stroke			1
since obesity is known to contribute to dozens of health problems , more research is needed to figure out why some are particularly prone to problems from obesity			0
' could it be genetics , specific dietary intake , physical lifestyle , emotional health or even the microbes that live in the gut ? ' asked senior investigator @entity124 , director of @entity10 's @entity125			0
' we need more studies to try to understand why obesity causes specific diseases in some people but not in others , ' @entity124 said			0
' this research demonstrates that some obese people are protected from the adverse metabolic effects of moderate weight gain , whereas others are predisposed to develop these problems			1
' this observation is important clinically because about 25 percent of obese people do not have metabolic complications , ' he added			1
' our data shows that these people remain metabolically normal even after they gain additional weight			0
' as part of the study , the researchers then helped the subjects lose the weight they had gained			0
' it 's important to point out that once the study was completed , we enrolled all subjects in our weight - loss program to make sure they lost all of the weight they had gained , or more , ' he said .			0
