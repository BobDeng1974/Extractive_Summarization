smoking cannabis every day warps key structures of the brain , a scientific study suggests			1
regular use of the drug seems to shrink the brain ’s ‘ grey matter ’ - the cells that crunch information - according to head scans of heavy drug users			1
the wiring of the brain – the ‘ white matter ’ that connects different parts - grows to compensate for the loss of the vital cells , scientists found			1
but eventually that also breaks down , impairing a drug users ’ ability to use and react to information			1
the findings add to a growing weight of evidence that suggests cannabis is more harmful than legalisation campaigners would have us believe			0
it comes after a review of 20 years of cannabis research , published last month by a professor at @entity47 , revealed that one in six teenagers who use cannabis become dependent on the drug , as do one in 10 adults			0
that review also suggested that cannabis use in teenagers doubles the risk of developing psychotic disorders including schizophrenia			0
the authors of the new study , from the universities of @entity30 and @entity31 , warn that people who take the drug in heavy quantities for prolonged periods are likely to suffer damaging effects			1
a definitive 20 - year study into the effects of long - term cannabis use has demolished the argument that the drug is safe			1
cannabis is highly addictive , causes mental health problems and opens the door to hard drugs , the study found			0
the paper by professor @entity75 , a drugs advisor to the @entity77 , builds a compelling case against those who deny the devastation cannabis wreaks on the brain			0
professor @entity75 found : examining brain scans , the scientists found that chronic marijuana users - who smoked an average of three times a day - had smaller average volumes of grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex , the part of the brain involved in mental processing and decision making			1
the cannabis users were also seen to have more ‘ white matter ’ - the connections between cells which affect how the brain learns and functions			1
the researchers suspect that those extra connections are forged as the brain tries to compensate for the lack of crucial grey matter			1
but even those extra connections were seen to break up within six to eight years under prolonged cannabis abuse , they found			0
dr @entity109 from the @entity110 said : ‘ what ’s unique about this work is that it combines three different magnetic resonance imaging techniques to evaluate different brain characteristics			0
‘ the results suggest increases in connectivity , both structural and functional that may be compensating for grey matter losses			1
‘ eventually , however , the structural connectivity or “ wiring ” of the brain starts degrading with prolonged marijuana use			0
’ the team studied mri scans of the brains of 48 adult cannabis users aged 20 to 36 who were compared with a group of 62 non-users			0
the orbitofrontal cortex region of the brain , where the biggest differences in cannabis users ’ brains was seen , is strongly linked to empathy - the ability to sense other people ’s feelings			1
neuroscientists believe damage to the orbitofrontal cortex may underpin many cases of personality disorder and psychopathy			0
the researchers found that the effect differed markedly depending on the age they started smoking and the number of years they continued to abuse the drug			2
the earlier someone started smoking cannabis , the greater the structural change to the brain and the larger the growth in white matter connections			1
this may explain why some chronic cannabis users sometimes appear to be coping normally , effectively masking the damage to their brain , the scientists said			2
examining brain scans , the scientists found that chronic marijuana users - who smoked an average of three times a day - had smaller average volumes of grey matter , pictured on an mri scan in light blue and green , in the orbitofrontal cortex , the part of the brain involved in mental processing and decision making but after six to eight years of continually taking cannabis the increases in structural wiring declined , they found			1
the scientists said that because their study represented a simple snapshot of users ’ brains , and did not monitor them over time , they could not be certain that the damage was directly caused by the drug			2
while the statistical picture they built up suggests that the drug abuse is linked to the structure of the brain , to be absolutely sure they more research is needed , they said			2
co-author dr @entity193 , also from @entity30 , said : ‘ we have seen a steady increase in the incidence of marijuana use since 2007			2
‘ however , research on its long - term effects remains scarce - despite the changes in legislation surrounding marijuana and the continuing conversation surrounding this relevant public health topic			0
‘ while our study does not conclusively address whether any or all of the brain changes are a direct consequence of marijuana use , these effects do suggest that these changes are related to age of onset and duration of use			0
’ @entity214 drugs law has been the subject of much debate in recent years			0
the @entity218 government downgraded the drug to @entity220 in 2004 – meaning officers did not normally arrest those caught with the drug - but reversed their decision within five years , returning it to @entity220 status			2
celebrities including @entity227 , @entity228 and @entity229 have called for it to be decriminalised , as has professor @entity231 , the government ’s former drugs advisor .			0

scientists at the universities of @entity30 and @entity31 found the drug does warp key structures in the brain
regular use shrank ' grey matter ' - the cells that process information
' white matter ' that connects different parts of the brain , grows to compensate but also breaks down impairing ability to react to information
