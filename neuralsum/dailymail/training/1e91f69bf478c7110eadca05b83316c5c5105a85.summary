when @entity1 and @entity2 moved into their home 37 years ago , they felt the leafy street of detached properties was among the finest in the suburb			0
but the couple fear their £ 275,000 home is now unsellable – after an extension on the house next door effectively turned the @entity16 ’ three - bedroom detached property into a semi			1
the two 1930s houses originally stood 4ft apart but are now separated by only inches			1
they stand so close together that their roofs and gutters overlap			0
‘ this will knock thousands off the value of our home			0
in fact , it probably makes it unsellable			0
’ mr @entity49 , 70 , a retired motor engineer , said 345 people from their neighbourhood of @entity52 , @entity33 , had signed a petition against the plans , including 125 from their own street			1
buy - to - let landlord @entity56 bought the house next door for £ 225,000 in december 2012 and submitted plans to extend the detached home at the front , side and rear			2
the plans were due to leave only a 12 - inch gap between the properties			2
the whites objected , fearing the extension would block out light to the rear of their home , and would leave them struggling to address any maintenance issues because of the two homes ’ close proximity			1
the plans – under which a garage and conservatory are replaced with additional living space , as well as a new rear dining room and the addition of a fourth bedroom upstairs – were approved by @entity84 in june last year			2
but to the whites ’ horror , the side extension went up only eight inches from their property			1
they complained and the council halted the building work while the issue was investigated			2
last week the council wrote to the @entity16 saying that the extension would be allowed to remain			1
the @entity16 say they are now unable to maintain their wall and guttering problems could damage their home the couple are shocked after building work extended the house next door to within inches of their property the letter from planning support officer @entity106 said : ‘ while the development as built is not considered ideal by officers , it is considered not sufficiently harmful to warrant formal enforcement action			1
’ he added that the @entity16 may wish to ‘ pursue the matter with your neighbour and if necessary , through a civil court ’			0
mr @entity56 ’s application for the ‘ single storey front and rear extension and two storey side extension ’ was approved subject to conditions which stipulated that the build ‘ must be in accordance with the plans ’			0
mrs @entity2 said she was shocked that the council failed to order him to rebuild the extension to the original plan			1
local mp @entity126 says planning conditions to ensure space between the homes was ignored @entity33 council says the work is not sufficiently different from that approved to require them to take action local residents have signed a petition against the development , which has been branded ' a monstrosity ' she added : ‘ we ’ve lost a degree of the morning light because it ’s blocked by the wall			1
their guttering lies underneath ours which renders theirs completely useless and is bound to cause problems when we have heavy rainfall			0
’ mr @entity56 was not at the property yesterday and could not be contacted for comment			0
@entity151 , a surveyor who acted as his agent on the planning application , said : ‘ i drew up the plans but he ( mr @entity56 ) did n’t stick to them			0
’ a council spokesman said the case has now been closed .			0

@entity33 homes used to have clear gap between them
but the space is now just a few inches after huge extension was built
couple say the development will hit their house price and cause damage
local mp says the extension differs from that given planning *permission*
but city council *refuse* to act because it is ' not sufficiently different '
