@entity1 president @entity0 has been forced to remove a poem from his personal website after @entity5 activists complained the author was a well - known @entity7			1
the poem , @entity9 , was removed yesterday after a group dedicated to fighting anti-semitism pointed out that the author was sentenced to death for collaborating with the @entity14 during the @entity15			2
the poet , @entity16 , was a priest from @entity17 in @entity19 ’s northern half , who in his political pamphlets likened @entity5 to ' vermin ' and ' weeds ' that needed exterminating			1
anger : @entity1 president @entity0 , pictured , said @entity9 was a favourite poem of his mother - in - law - but it was written by well - known @entity7 @entity16 , who described @entity5 as weeds he was promoted to head of the @entity31 cultural council by the @entity14 during the occupation of @entity19 and fled to @entity33 when the allies liberated the country in 1944 , taking part thereafter in the @entity31 government in exile			1
he was sentenced to death by the @entity19 courts when the war ended , but the sentence was never carried out as @entity33 did not extradite him			0

hate preacher : @entity16 was a priest from @entity17 in @entity19 who in his political pamphlets likened @entity5 to ' vermin ' and ' weeds ' that needed exterminating mr @entity0 , who has been accused of being the ' human face ' of @entity31 extremists , said he included the poem on his website because it was a favourite of his mother - in - law			1
as chairman of the @entity53 , @entity0 is in frequent touch with all @entity1 heads of state and government , including @entity57			1
he is something of a poet himself and is well known for writing ‘ haikus ’ or short poems in traditional @entity63 style			0
the @entity64 against anti-semitism welcomed the decision to take down the poem , which dates back to 1909			0
' whereas this poem contains no anti-semitic references and was on mr @entity0 ’s website for personal reasons that have no relation with the political convictions of the author , the @entity64 underlines that this is an oeuvre by the writer @entity16 , who , from 1940 , collaborated actively with the @entity7 occupiers and was sentenced to death in absentia by the @entity19 courts after the @entity15 , ' it said in a statement			1
@entity85 @entity84 leader @entity83 has clashed publicly with @entity0 on several occasions			0
@entity83 was fined by the @entity87 for saying @entity0 had “ all the charisma of a damp rag ” - a reference to his permanent low profile			2
