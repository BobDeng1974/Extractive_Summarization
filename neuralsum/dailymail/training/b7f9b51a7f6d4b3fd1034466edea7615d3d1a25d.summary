by @entity0 published : 19:50 est , 18 july 2013 updated : 00:36 est , 19 july 2013 on a friday night out , you want to be looking your best , so imagine the embarrassment and humiliation one man felt when told he would n't be allowed into a local bar because of the color of his shorts			1
@entity9 from @entity10 , was looking forward to spending the evening at @entity11 but he was turned away with a friend at the door , because he was wearing gold - colored shorts made of @entity16 , a metallic fabric			1
mr @entity9 posted on @entity18 earlier this week claiming he was discriminated against			1
entry denied : @entity9 was told he would not be allowed into the @entity10 piano bar because his shorts violated the dress code and looked like they were from a costume the offending articles : these shiny sleek shorts were deemed to be outside of @entity11 's dress code gossip : @entity0 said he could hear the door staff talking about him in the line even before he asked to be let in if you 're wearing gold shorts , you 're not coming in : @entity9 was told by the doorman ( pictured ) that his colorful choice of shorts were not suitable for the bar			1
the owners have since apologised to him he was told by the doorman that @entity11 ’s was ' a bar with standards and a dress code ' and his shorts were too costume - like			1
he took to @entity18 to rant not only at the bar but at the city of @entity10 too , citing the city 's cultural intolerance			1
' i 'm so hurt that @entity10 can claim to be up and coming in the world , yet still be so culturally behind			2
it should be noted that this is not the first bar my wardrobe has been an issue at			2
@entity10 may no longer be on the @entity53 dying cities list … but i feel its people might be changing that			2
what 's going to happen when @entity58 rolls around this year ? slated to be the biggest yet , with visitors from all over the country			2
will the local bars refuse to serve anyone not wearing stock mall clothing ? ' his post has been shared by 210 people who promised to send angry emails to the bar			2
the bar has finally taken notice and apologised citing a ' communication breakdown ' promising to teach staff how to differentiate between ' a dress code violation and an individual expressing oneself in an innocently creative manner			1
' rules must be obeyed : @entity0 was told by the doorman at @entity79 s was ' a bar with standards and a dress code ' and his shorts were too costume - like are these shorts acceptable ? @entity0 is seen with his specially designed shoes and man - purse designer : a budding fashion designer , @entity0 designed the gold shorts himself after realizing they were the latest ' in ' thing on the catwalks around the world the latest trend : on his blog , @entity0 mentioned how shiny gold clothing is the latest fashion must - have and that he was simple adhering to the ' norm ' by wearing them ' our employees acted as they believed was necessary to enforce our establishment ’s dress code			1
however , it is clear that our dress code needs to be modified in order to accommodate for individuals whose fashion selections may be a little more fashion forward than we are accustomed to			0
' the bar did state that ' there are certain guidelines we will continue to uphold ' in regards to a dress code			2
' no excessively holey jeans , no cutoff shirts , etc. , ' the post read			0
' but mr. @entity9 's attire is something we have not previously been presented with at @entity11 's and , thus , requires addressing			1
' owner @entity121 characterized the entire situation as a non-event which was handled by the manager at the time			0
' @entity126 is open to anyone , he said to @entity128			0
' we have everybody from 21 to 60 , from all walks of life , in on a regular basis			0
however this turned into a discrimination thing is 100 percent false			0
' mr @entity9 describes himself as a fashion expert			1
' i have studied it for years			0
i run a @entity140 fashion blog , @entity141 , with a small following of about 40,000			0
i have also been published internationally in fashion books and magazines over the years , ' he writes			0
' metallics was a huge trend for @entity148			0
all the important shows had some type of metallic in it			0
be it @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 ... so in the rest of the world my outfit was on trend and nothing out of the ' norm ' as they liked to call it			0
they also happened to be something locally made in west @entity10 by myself			0
the discrimination comes into play when the other guys in our group ( wearing shorts the same length and style ) could enter the bar without question			1
but i could not , and with no explanation , other than i was wearing a ' costume			2
'' mr @entity9 said the bar reached out to him late on wednesday and added he hopes to reach an ' agreement that makes both parties happy			1

@entity9 was told his gold shorts were like something from a ' costume ' and was denied entry to the bar
mr @entity9 ranted about his treatment on @entity18 claiming @entity190 , @entity191 to be ' culturally behind '
the bar has now apologized citing a ' communication breakdown
