drivers who smoke with a child in the car will face a £ 50 fine from next year , under plans backed by ministers			2
they say making it a criminal offence will protect children from second - hand smoke , which is linked to serious health problems			1
a ban is set to be implemented on october 1 , with police officers to issue fixed penalty notices for those caught smoking with an under - 18 in the car			1
drivers who smoke with a child in the car will face a £ 50 fine from next year , under plans backed by ministers ministers have given the plan their support , including @entity24 , whose spokesman said this year he believed ‘ the time has come ’ for such a law			1
but while health campaigners are pleased with the move , questions have been raised about how the ban would be enforced and whether it would waste police time			2
under the draft law published yesterday , it would be an offence for adults to ‘ smoke in a private vehicle with someone under age 18 present ’			1
health minister @entity41 ( left ) said second - hand smoke was ' a real threat to children 's health ' , while professor @entity46 of the @entity47 ( right ) said the ban was ' an important step ' it would also be an offence for a driver to ‘ fail to prevent smoking in a private vehicle with someone age under 18 present ’ if another passenger is lighting up			1
both would carry an immediate fine of £ 50 , but non-payment could result in criminal charges			0
it would be the biggest crackdown on smoking since 2006 , when smoking was banned in all public places			0
and while polls suggest the majority of adults – and smokers – back a ban , even the anti-smoking campaign group @entity69 conceded it could be ‘ difficult to enforce ’ and called for ministers to go further and ban smoking in cars altogether			2
@entity76 , of the @entity77 , said : ‘ while it is undoubtedly the right thing to do in principle in terms of children ’s health , it may be overly optimistic to think it will be enforced on a widespread basis			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity84 said : ‘ there is haze around enforcement – are children going to have to tell on their parents ? ’ public health minister @entity41 said yesterday : ‘ second - hand smoke is a real threat to children ’s health … the only effective way to protect children is to prevent them breathing second - hand smoke and our plans to stop smoking in cars carrying children will help us to do this ’			1
mps and peers approved the principle of the law earlier this year			1
the final hurdle is a vote next month on the wording of the bill , but mps are expected to give it resounding support			1
the ban would only apply in @entity112 as smoking legislation is devolved , although @entity114 and @entity115 are both consulting on a similar ban			0
@entity112 would be the second country in @entity119 to impose such a ban , after @entity121			0
smoking in cars with children under age 12 present is banned in @entity126			2
in @entity127 and some @entity128 states the law applies with under - 18s present			1
the @entity130 say around half a million children are exposed to second - hand smoke every week in a family car			2
around 300,000 gp visits a year are caused by children passive smoking			0
professor @entity46 of the @entity47 said the ban was ‘ an important step ’			0
@entity139 said cars carrying under - 18s should be smoke - free to ‘ protect young people from the serious health harms of smoked tobacco ’ a @entity139 spokesman said enforcement was being discussed with the @entity147			1
as with the ban on using a mobile while driving , and seatbelt legislation , police officers will be able to stop a car if they believe an offence is taking place			0
they can ask for identification to check someone ’s age , but the passenger does not have to provide it			0
police will have to make a ‘ reasonable assessment ’ of the situation			0
@entity163 called the ban a ‘ gross intrusion on people ’s privacy ’ and said enforcing it would be a waste of police time .			0

@entity139 said cars carrying under - 18s should be smoke - free
mps will vote on the issue in before the *election* , @entity174 *announces*
if passed the change in the law will come into force on october 1
