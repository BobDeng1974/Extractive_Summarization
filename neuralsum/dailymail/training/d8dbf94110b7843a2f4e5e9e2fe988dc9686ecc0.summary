by @entity0 for @entity1 a secret - sharing app which allows people to post anonymous confessions is vulnerable and puts the identity of users at risk , it has been revealed			1
@entity9 has attracted gossip lovers who can post their own embarrassing admissions online while judging the deepest secrets of their friends and contacts			1
but ' white hat ' ethical hackers @entity15 and @entity18 were able to identify the names of people behind the posts by using personal email addresses and ' dummy ' accounts			2
according to hackers , @entity9 - the app allowing users to post confessions anonymously - is vulnerable and puts the identity of the users at risk users can join the app by simply providing a phone number , email address or @entity33 account			1
once a member , you are then able to see and comment on secrets posted by your friends , and friends of friends , because of an algorithm that tracks contacts			2
examples of the messages include : ' am applying for jobs while still at work ' and ' secretly excited for the new @entity48 single , i am a 30 year old [ sic ] dude			0
' by filling their contact list with fake profiles and one genuine profile , the hackers were able to identify the secrets admitted by the genuine friend			2
using this method , the pair were also able to see that @entity9 's chief executive @entity57 had posted via the app : ' is @entity59 the cutest dog ? ' sometimes companies bring in hackers to try and highlight flaws in their systems			1
mr @entity15 said his attempted breach was an experiment			0
the messages are shared with @entity33 contacts and friends using an algorithm designed by @entity9 , allowing other users to comment on the posts mr @entity15 told the @entity73 : ' we were able to manipulate the process of adding friends to the app and replace real " friends " with dummy accounts we created , causing the application to believe we have a large group of friends and that any one friend 's secret would be anonymous			1
' in actuality , only one real person was added – the victim – so any secrets from friends would be identified as theirs			0
' @entity57 , who is also the co-founder of @entity9 , admitted in an interview last week : ' we do not say that you will be completely safe at all times and be completely anonymous			1
' some of the admissions published by users are serious , while others are more light - hearted the potential flaws in the supposedly ' secret ' apps have come to light in recent months , with the identity of users at risk of being revealed			0
@entity101 , the popular photo sharing app , settled with the @entity103 and accepted 20 years of monitoring by @entity103 regulators over charges that it deceived users			0
what the company promised users - that photos shared with friends will disappear once they are seen - is n't always true .			0

users join @entity9 app via phone number , email address or @entity33 profile
they can then read anonymous admissions posted by their friends
but hackers have *developed* a simple way to reveal who is behind a post
chief executive of @entity9 admits confessions are not ' completely safe '
