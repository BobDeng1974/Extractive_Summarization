within seconds , my eyelashes freeze			2
shortly followed by the hairs inside my nose			0
it 's minus @entity6 ; a punishing cold - and tonight i 'll be sleeping in a room made entirely of ice			1
i 'm not allowed to take any personal belongings with me because they 'll freeze			0
the @entity10 , in @entity11 in @entity12 , 120 miles into the arctic circle , celebrates its 25th birthday this year			1
its presence is cyclical : every march , huge blocks of ice are harvested from the town 's lifeblood , the @entity20 ; stored in a freezing warehouse over summer and carved , mounted up and smoothed into 55 ethereal rooms , an ice bar and a chapel			1
come april , the sun is strong , everything melts and the river rolls on again			1
i start to regret the generous helping of wine i had ' to warm me up ' – no one needs an emergency midnight loo visit at -5c			1
i may be lying on several reindeer hides , but the ice bed , walls , floor , ceiling and sculptures are n't exactly lulling me to sleep			1
@entity56 , but the peace is immediate , i can hear my own breath			0
the hotel is open to guests from december to april , and sees as many as 50,000 visitors in a season			1
main hall , pictured here @entity63 through the skies above the @entity29 ; where sightings of the impressive ionisation of atmospheric particles are common ' do n't underestimate how cold it can be			1
dressing correctly in the @entity70 environment , where temperatures can easily dip below @entity72 , enables visitors to enjoy the pristine wilderness without exposing themselves to very real danger , ' says simply @entity78 's @entity77			1
' we offer the following advice to all customers who book a winter holiday to this region and most of our holidays include a loan of high grade warm outer clothing for activities			0
the first should by thin , made from synthetic fabric or wool ( not cotton ) and designed to wick moisture away from the body			0
there are some excellent technical fabrics on the market			0
next , a thick middle layer , or several thin layers ( make sure they fit over each other , allowing free movement ) – base layers , fleeces or wool jumpers work well			1
bring thermal leggings , too			0
' although we arrange for loans of clothing such as wool fleece bottoms and snowmobile suits , it 's a good idea to bring a large down wind and waterproof jacket and protective trousers			0
if you get hot , you can always take a layer off			0
wear thin liner gloves , then a pair of mittens , which keep hands warmer than finger gloves			0
liner socks ( silk are good ) , then one or two pairs of wool , not cotton , socks will keep feet warm and dry , as will a pair of specialist boots ( try them on with all your socks )			0
again , guests are provided with appropriate boots , thick leather mittens and protective deerstalker hats for outdoor activities			1
' do n't wash or shave just before going out into the cold – the natural oils in the skin protect against the extreme elements			1
and do n't use water - based cosmetics or soaps because they will freeze			0
' extreme weather : temperatures in @entity78 can drop down to as low as minus 40 degrees in the winter months on checking in , guests are armed with an enormous padded boiler suit , snow boots , fleece and leather mittens and a balaclava			1
over the four days of my stay , temperatures drop to @entity154 , so despite looking like a cross between @entity157 and a yeti , these warm items become my allies			0
it 's not all freezing though			0
the hotel has two warm receptions and a warm restaurant dishing out reindeer meat and hot chocolate , as well as plenty of warm suites and chalets			0
also , once you 've been outside , the interior seems quite toasty			0
' @entity172 ' the combination of snow and ice used to build the hotel , is insulating , keeping the temperature at -5c			2
cold rooms come in tiers : from bread and butter ice bed and four walls to super deluxe suites complete with a warm section with a sauna and toilet built in			1
but the art suites are king			0
each year , the hotel pumps around £ 900,000 into gathering ideas from graphic designers , wood sculptors , street artists , architects – even musicians ( over 50 per cent have never worked with ice before )			1
a jury decides the best 15 and the artist then travels to @entity12 to construct their design			0
' we 're not looking for another swan or dolphin , we want original ideas , ' says @entity205 , one of the hotel 's top designers			0
' we do n't want the rooms to look like ice cream and slush			1
' my room , ways of vision , designed by @entity12 sculptors @entity215 and @entity216 , entitled @entity217			2
inspired by the corbels of @entity222 , statues on pillars surrounding the bed , symbolise the different ways of seeing which exist in our world			0
61 cold rooms at the @entity29 72 warm rooms at the ice hotel 50,000 annual visitors to the @entity29 80 weddings take place each year at the @entity29 900 tonnes of ice used in its construction each year , the hotel gathers ideas from artists across the globe : @entity238 , designed by @entity239 and @entity240 , pictured here @entity241 travelled with simply @entity78 ( www.simplysweden.co.uk ; 01427 700115 )			1
its three - night traditional @entity29 break costs from £ 995 per person , including b&b accommodation ( one night in a cold room , two nights in a warm room ) , flights , transfers and a guided tour of @entity29			1
activities cost extra , but often include lunch or dinner and start at £ 124 per person for a four - hour @entity257 with evening meal			2
for more information on @entity12 @entity12 , visit @entity260 there 's an art to dressing for cold weather , especially sleeping in it			1
the idea is to layer , but only using the correct fabrics , if you get too warm , you 'll sweat , and when the moisture freezes , so will you			0
several fellow visitors do n't appear to have received the memo ; i see one motley lot wondering around in onesies , a woman carrying an aeroplane travel pillow and one lunatic even wearing flip flops			2
the cold weather clearly gets to people			2
' children often try and lick the ice , ' says @entity281 , the guide			2
' last year a 24 - year - old student try to kiss the ice and staff had to unstick him using hot water and chisels '			1
i 'm told another member of staff walked in on a couple making the most of the double sleeping bag , too			1
but mostly , people just do n't wear the right clothes and suffer as a consequence			0
it takes a while to shift the ' i 'm cold ' voice in my head , and i manage to lose a crucial glove and my hat during the night , but i wake up feeling remarkably refreshed			1
i thought i 'd feel shattered in the morning , but i feel cleansed ; lighter ; like i 've spent the night inhaling the purest @entity12 air			2
there 's something quite magical about sleeping in ice			1
at the @entity307 , cocktails are served up ' in ice ' ; while the hotel is required by law to have fire extinguishers , despite threat of fire being unlikely the art suite , @entity314 , designed by artist @entity315 and interior designer @entity316 , uses lighting to stunning effect art suites @entity319 by @entity320 and @entity321 , left , and two as one , by @entity324 , right it seems ice hotel visitors are a fruity lot : last year , one room featured a female bust made entirely of ice			1
two prominent features were practically worn down to nothing by the end of the season			0
the hotel offers all kinds of tours , from dog sledding to snowmobiling through the @entity340 - like forests , where trees wear their heavy snow like thick fur coats			2
a night snow mobile excursion leaves me with frostbite , and twenty minutes into my reindeer sledding experience , i am alone in a forest at minus 35			2
my slightly clapped out reindeer wo n't run for love nor money , which results in me letting out some embarrassing , desperate go faster noises			0
meanwhile another member of the team falls off three times , and even the reindeers start to frost over			0
but the best is saved for my last night			2
' @entity364 , they 're massive , ' somebody cries in the @entity366 restaurant , a listed wood clad building , offering @entity29 customers all manner of cockle - warming local dishes			1
i stumble outside as fast as is possible in my boiler suit , eight pairs of socks , two hats , and three balaclavas , and look up			0
the cold has stopped burning , and i lie in a mound of snow taking photographs			2
my camera growls and dies			0
the whole black starry night is lit up in green with streaks like a @entity385 jet stream and burning white strands circle above			2
not everything survives the cold here , but if you can , it 's well worth a night at the @entity29 .			1
