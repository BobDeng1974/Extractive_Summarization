@entity0 has proved himself in the @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and now , on the biggest stage of them all , the @entity7			1
but the forward , having spent three of his five - year deal with @entity11 on loan to other clubs , is yet to be given a chance in the @entity15 by @entity16			2
the 21 - year - old put in a commanding performance for @entity19 in their 3 - 1 win over @entity22 , scoring one and setting up another , but will that be enough to make it on to the @entity11 manager 's radar or will it go unnoticed for another year ? video : scroll down to see @entity11 's @entity0 score a belter for @entity19 goal : @entity0 scores for @entity19 in their surprise 3 - 1 win over @entity22 in the @entity36 opener ready : @entity0 has cut his teeth with @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 but looks ready to return are you watching , @entity16 ? @entity16 may take notice of @entity0 's commanding performance against @entity22 2009 - 2011 : @entity44 ( 2 apps / 0 goals ) 2011 : @entity46 ( loan ) ( 5/0 ) 2011 - now : @entity11 ( 0/0 ) 2011 - 2012 : @entity38 ( loan ) ( 25/3 ) 2012 - 2013 : @entity39 ( loan ) ( 28/2 ) 2013 - 2014 : @entity40 ( loan ) ( 32/8 ) @entity0 , just as he did in the @entity1 against @entity51 at @entity52 , proved worthy of the competition in @entity54 by scoring an impressive goal			1
his strike in the 54th minute brought @entity19 level , having taken a moment to control the ball , set himself and beat goalkeeper @entity60 with a superb half - volley			2
they went on to score two more , securing a surprise win over a @entity22 lacking striker @entity64			0
the third and killer goal by substitute @entity67 was set up by an inch - perfect through - ball by @entity0 , too			0
even towards the dying minutes , the youngster was winning corners to eat up time and , albeit inadvertently , was fouled by a frustrated @entity73 , who saw red for the ugly challenge			0
chance : @entity0 scored one , assisted another , killed time towards the end and was fouled in the red card missing : @entity0 could n't find himself in @entity80 @entity0 may have struggled to find a sticker of himself before the @entity7 began but he certainly made himself known to those unaware of his talents with a superb display against @entity22			2
the @entity11 striker infamously bought 100 packs of @entity87 stickers in april â€“ and failed to find a single one of him			0
he posted an image including a pile of what he says is 100 opened packets , each of which include five stickers so 500 in total , and lamented that none of them included him			0
on loan at @entity40 last season , the 21 - year - old shone in the @entity1 last 16 round against @entity51 , and his latest match - winning performance in @entity54 will not have gone unnoticed by @entity16			1
@entity0 's five - year contract with @entity11 in 2011 has seen him go largely unnoticed at the @entity104			2
he was shipped out on loan to @entity3 's @entity38 and @entity2 's @entity39 , before becoming instrumental in @entity40 winning the @entity4 by a landslide 17 points			1
@entity0 is eligible to play for @entity11 , having tweeted his joy at receiving a work permit in july 2013			1
the @entity7 can often act as an audition for players , and @entity0 made his chance count			0
the extent , though , is down to @entity16			0
allowed : @entity0 was eligible to play for @entity11 last year , having received his work permit in july 2013			1

@entity0 scores and assists in @entity19 's 3 - 1 win over @entity22
the 21 - year - old was loaned out to @entity3 's @entity38 , @entity2 's @entity39 and @entity4 's @entity40
@entity0 is yet to play for @entity11 but is eligible , having been granted a work permit in july 2013
