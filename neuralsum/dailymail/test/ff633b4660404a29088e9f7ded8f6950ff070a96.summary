with a ' megadrought ' forecast to hit the @entity2 in the coming decades , parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs			2
@entity5 is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the @entity10 and seeding the sky with silver iodide			1
they hope the technology will allow them to mitigate some of the worst impacts of climate change – but not everyone is convinced			0
with a ' megadrought ' forecast to hit the @entity2 in the coming decades , parched states are turning to increasingly radical solutions to fill their reservoirs			0
@entity5 is leading the way with plans to create artificial rain clouds by flying planes over the @entity10 , and seeding the sky with silver iodide the process of cloud seeding was first proposed in the 1940s at the @entity29 labs in @entity30 , @entity31			1
two decades later , the @entity32 and the @entity33 invested in research to make it a reality			1
' it has n't been taken off the table as a potential tool as we work our way through drought now and in the future , ' @entity42 , @entity5 's state climatologist told @entity44 at @entity45			0
since 2007 , @entity32 has put about $ 1 million toward research happening in other states to increase the supply of water in the @entity51 system			1
water in the air , even in dry areas , can be transformed into ice crystals by using planes to seed the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice if it seems like it never stops raining , blame the @entity63			1
@entity67 chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world 's weather , a conference heard in february			0
a leading academic told how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding			0
professor @entity76 , from @entity77 in @entity78 , said : ' consultants working for the @entity67 rang and said we 'd like to know if someone is controlling the world 's climate would we know about it ? ' of course they were also asking - if we control someone else 's climate would they then know about it			0
' the professor is one of many scientists from around the world are actively looking at manipulating the weather as a way of combating climate change			2
professor @entity76 told the callers that any attempts to meddle with the weather on a large scale would be detectable			0
the system works on the premise that rainfall takes place when supercooled droplets of water form ice crystals			2
as a result they become too heavy to remain suspended in the air , and fall , often melting on their way down to form rain			0
water in the air , even in dry areas , can be transformed into ice crystals by seeding the atmosphere with chemicals such as silver iodide or dry ice			1
they create rain by inducing nucleation – a process in which water is in the air condenses around the particles and crystallises to form ice			2
but some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins , as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water			1
compared to other alternatives , such as desalinating seawater , cloud seeding is the cheapest option , though it is n't going to be a drought - buster on its own			1
in a recent @entity141 pilot project , the technology resulted in an increase of seasonal snow water accumulations of 5 to 15 per cent			2
but @entity42 , the state climatologist , told @entity45 that the trickiest part of cloud seeding is measuring whether an area got more rainfall			1
' so the effectiveness of it is in doubt , ' she said			0
' it 's not that it 's completely ineffective – they 're pretty sure it has some impact – but it 's pretty hard to measure			0
' some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins , as well as legal uncertainties over who should get the additional water			1

@entity32 invested $ 1 million to research cloud seeding
process involves seeding clouds over the @entity10 with silver iodide
some scientists are concerned about silver building up in river basins
there are also legal uncertainties over who should get additional water
