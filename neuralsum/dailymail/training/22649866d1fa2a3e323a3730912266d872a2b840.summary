@entity0 has to be dumped as defence minister now - that 's the view of former @entity4 leader dr @entity3			1
dr @entity3 told @entity6 that mr @entity0 was ' in real strife ' and @entity8 had to act to stop what is ' a festering sore going into the festive season '			1
' you have to nip that in the bud as fast as you can , otherwise all you have is instability and uncertainty ' he said			0
defence minister @entity0 has been embroiled in two recent controversies , revelations he indulged in a series of expensive meals with industry officials chasing lucrative government contracts and comments made that he would n't trust @entity24 to ' build canoes ' dr @entity3 , former @entity4 leader , said : ' defence has a history of being able to eat their own - we 've seen it before - i think he 's in real strife and i think the sooner that @entity8 deals with the fact that he 's not competent to be a minister of defence ' dr @entity3 was the leader of the @entity4 for four years in the 90s , contesting one federal election ' @entity8 may have confidence in @entity0 but that leak about expenses suggests to me defence does n't have confidence in him			1
' defence has a history of eating their own , we 've seen that before happy to others - i think he ( @entity0 ) is in real strife and i think the sooner that @entity8 deals with the fact that he 's not competent to be a minister of defence the better			1
' he warned that if the @entity48 did n't take action ' it will be a festering sore into the festive season and it will only get worse			0
' he also took a swipe at the prime minister 's assertion that a @entity56 reshuffle was on the cards			0
' it 's silly , if you are going to say that , the expectation there is that it is going to happen and the pressure grows for it to happen , so i guess it 's better to have it sooner rather than later - you ca n't have it too late			0
' the prime minister has had to put out internal fires on several fronts , including a confrontation with deputy liberal leader @entity70 over plans to have her ' chaperoned ' at the @entity73 climate conference @entity70 is believed to have pushed back on the plan to have her accompanied to the @entity73 @entity75 by @entity76 ' that was really dumb to attack her '			0
@entity3 thinks @entity8 made a big mistake in his move to have @entity70 ' chaperoned ' at the @entity73 meeting by @entity76 dr @entity3 called mr @entity8 's planned move to have foreign minister @entity70 ' chaperoned ' at the @entity83 as dumb			1
' that was really dumb to attack her , ' he said , agreeing that she , along with immigration minister @entity86 , were the star performers in @entity56 this past year			0
' that 's right , and she recognises the inevitability of the fact that next year in the course of the run - up to the @entity94 meeting that the world is going to move towards an emissions reduction target and we should be part of that process , it means the government has to change some of its policy , ' dr @entity3 added			1
' @entity8 would be dismayed that the government has had success in foreign affairs and immigration , things like @entity103 for instance but that he would be 10 points behind in the polls and not the preferred prime minister , ' dr @entity3 said			1
treasurer @entity111 has , meantime tried to brush aside claims some colleagues want him dumped , in favour of @entity114			2
when asked on @entity115 whether @entity111 was safe as treasurer , the pm replied ' of course , of course '			2
. going on to call him a man of ' remarkable resilience , focus and grit '			0
there are increasing calls for @entity0 to be dumped as defence minister but the prime minister is sticking by him under pressure			1
there are reports senior @entity56 members are angling for @entity111 's removal as @entity111 in favour of @entity114 but he too has the pm 's support ' i rate @entity111 very highly indeed and the public should do too , ' he told reporters on friday			1
' he has tackled this ( the @entity138 ) with a will , with a purpose , with a single mindedness and strength of character			0
' asked in an interview with the @entity147 's 7.30 program whether it was time to reshape the @entity149 front - bench , mr @entity8 said : ' at some stage between now and the next election , quite probably , but this is a good front - bench			0
' ' @entity111 has been criticised lately , but i tell you what , i think @entity111 is going to be one of the great treasurers because he 's someone who bounces back and that 's what he 's doing now , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' @entity111 has been criticised lately , but i tell you what , i think @entity111 is going to be one of the great treasurers because he 's someone who bounces back and that 's what he 's doing now , ' mr @entity8 said mr @entity111 also dismissed as ' silly ' the questions about his future			2
he is due to hand down his mid-year budget review within the next fortnight			0
dr @entity3 said if he was either @entity0 or @entity111 , he would be very uncomfortable at hearing they had the prime minister 's backing			1
' maybe i 'm a bit cynical but i would be worried if i was @entity0 or @entity176 to hear that the prime minister say he has absolute confidence in them , many times that can turn out negative , ' he to @entity6			0
@entity6 has sought comment from mr @entity0 , his office again stressing that he continues to have the @entity48 's support .			2
