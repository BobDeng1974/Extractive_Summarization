by @entity0 shopping trolleys abandoned , bags dropped on the floor and beer bottles left where they stand , these haunting images show the shops which were deserted in the aftermath of the @entity10 mall massacre which left 67 people dead and dozens more missing			1
carts full of goods were left standing in @entity14 as shoppers fled for their lives when jihadi terrorists rushed the building and started gunning down customers			1
the photographs show how people apparently dropped bags on the ground as they made their escape , forming a disturbing portrait of the moment chaos broke out			1
as the gunmen walked through the mall , shooting anyone in sight , shoppers ran , hid or died one popular restaurant , @entity49 , still has purses and handbags on the tables , as well as empty bottles of beer , making it look as if customers had only left for a minute			1
but in other shops the floors are covered in broken glass , hinting at the violence which broke out at the mall on september 21			1
in @entity63 , which sells mobile phones and other hi - tech goods , the shelves appear to have been looted , with products smashed on the floor along with their glass cases			0
other images show how the mall 's car park was destroyed by explosives during the attack , while police are currently examining the remains of burnt - out vehicles in the area in a bid to gather clues on the origins of the atrocity			2
empty : the @entity42 restaurant and coffee shop is situated on the ground floor of @entity14			2
little damage can be seen here compared to the devastation in other areas of the mall chaos : the @entity91 computer store is littered with debris , and its cabinets are bare , showing signs of looting reported by businesses throughout the mall forensics : investigators work in the mall passageways scouring the building for clues which may lead to other terrorists involved in the attack another 39 people remain unaccounted for almost a week after the end of the attack , the @entity105 said today			1
its report conflicts with the government 's contention that there are no remaining missing people from the attack on the @entity14 and suggests that the death toll could still rise as investigators dig through the rubble			1
' the numbers with us are what we are still showing as open cases that are reported to us ' , @entity117 @entity105 head @entity116 said			0
' the only way to verify this is when the government declares the @entity14 100 per cent cleared - then we can resolve it			0
' destruction : this picture shows the mall car park which collapsed as a result of the attack explosion : burnt - out vehicles have been abandoned outside @entity14 as the work of clearing up the mall continues the @entity105 number has been dropping over the past week as bodies have been positively identified and as some missing people have been reunited with their families			1
on friday it said the number of missing was 59			0
on sunday interior minister @entity142 said that police had no missing persons reports from the attack , and did not believe there were any hostages in the mall building when it partially collapsed			2
he left open the possibility , however , that things might change			0
' we think - unless the forensic investigation shows otherwise - we really do think that there were were n't any hostages , ' he said			0
entrance : the scene outside the mall 's main gate remains chaotics nine days after the initial outbreak of violence investigation : forensic police inspect a saloon car parked near the main entrance of the mall investigators from @entity168 , @entity169 , the @entity170 and @entity171 , are helping in the investigation into the attack and are aiding @entity117 forensic experts poring through the mall complex			2
results are not expected until later this week at the earliest			0
in addition to the 61 civilians and six troops reported killed in the attack , the government has said five of the attackers were killed by gunfire and at least one more is thought to be in the building 's rubble			0
the militant group @entity186 has said it carried out the mall attack to punish @entity117 for sending its troops into neighboring @entity189 to fight the @entity191 - linked militant group that had seized large parts of that country for years before being dislodged from the capital , @entity195 .			0
