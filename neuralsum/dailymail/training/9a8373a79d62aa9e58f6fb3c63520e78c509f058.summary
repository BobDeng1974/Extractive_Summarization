by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:51 est , 15 january 2013 updated : 11:50 est , 15 january 2013 five @entity3 employees who posted an appeal for a new job in the window of their closed - down store have already been attracting attention from possible employers			1
the group of loyal workers have apparently been ordered to remove the window display - but within just three days , job offers were pouring in for the laid - off staff			1
one potential employer even offered to fly the group out to @entity17 to discuss the possibility of employing them			1
the workers at the @entity22 branch of @entity3 posted photographs of themselves with the message , ' five unemployed and loyal staff seeking work			1
can you help ? ' in the window of their store after the firm stopped trading on friday			2
' devastating effect ' : staff from the @entity22 branch of @entity3 plastered their photos in the window of the store in the hope of finding new employment @entity39 said he and his fellow team - members - some of whom have worked for @entity3 for up to 15 years - wanted to show the ' real faces ' behind yet another blow to the @entity46 high street			1
and it did not take long for the workers ' inventive appeal to capture the public imagination - mr @entity39 , 44 , told @entity51 today that ' within hours there was a response '			2
he added : ' this morning we 've had someone ring us from @entity17 , to fly us over there and discuss an opportunity			1
' while emphasising that ' it 's going to take time ' to get all the employees back into work , he expressed confidence that the @entity22 staff would find new jobs before long as a result of the unconventional advertising			1
' loyal staff ' : mr @entity39 's picture beneath the sign featuring the staff 's call for help however , mr @entity39 warned that many of the other 1,370 @entity3 employees would find it harder to return to the labour market , and urged the government to do more to support struggling retailers			2
' it 's not me who 's on the scrapheap , ' he said			2
' the personal battles have just started for each member of my store			0
' he continued : ' why ca n't crippling high street rents be subsidised by the government ? when a store has to find the best part of Â£ 92,000 before it makes a profit , that adds up			2
' you can introduce all the measures you want , but once a company is making losses it 's forever playing catch up			0
' we have had literally hundreds of people knocking on our door telling us how sorry we were that we were going			0
we would like to say thank you for that - but what we really want are jobs that replace the ones we have lost			2
' on tuesday @entity3 staff were seen taking down the employees ' display from the shop window in @entity22			1
@entity108 reported that the firm had ordered that the display be removed a day after it sprang to national attention after being featured on @entity51			0
around 1,370 shop staff were left jobless when @entity3 closed its 187 stores across the @entity115 last week			1
further redundancies at the chain 's head office in @entity119 also look likely			0
mr @entity39 said their window display - which also includes a sign that reads : ' what 's happening to our high streets ? ' - had created quite a stir in the town centre			2
' it 's brought quite a bit of attention , ' said mr @entity39 , who said people had come in to sympathise with the team as they packed away stock and equipment inside the closed store			2
high street casualty : all 187 @entity3 stores nationwide have ceased trading the team 's collective enthusiasm for their work made the news of their fate all the more devastating , according to mr @entity39 , who said staff only learned of the chain 's collapse when a journalist called the @entity22 branch for a comment			1
' it was really out of the blue , ' he said			0
' we had no warning			0
i 've seen my colleagues crying , wondering how they are going to pay their rents			0
' mr @entity39 , who in the meantime intends to concentrate on his professional photographic work after losing his position at @entity3 , said this latest retail casualty indicated a bleak future for the @entity46 high street			0
' when @entity162 went down i did pay it some attention , but it does n't really hit you until it happens to you , ' said mr @entity39 , adding that @entity3 had struggled to compete with internet retailers			0
' people were coming in for our expert advice , then using that to buy stock online , ' he said			0
' i do think we could have adapted better			0
it is a crying shame			0
' final days : customers browse in the @entity174 branch of @entity3 on the day before stores across the country closed their doors he also commented on the irony of @entity180 going into administration so soon after @entity3 , saying that the local branch of the entertainment shop was ' literally a two - second walk '			1
the chief executive of @entity180 , @entity186 , was chief executive of @entity3 until july last year			0
as @entity46 's only specialist camera retailer , @entity3 had been a fixture on high streets nationwide for almost 80 years			1
its collapse followed that of a number of familiar high street names over the course of last year , including fellow camera retailer @entity196 in june 2012 , and @entity162 in november			1
@entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 also went under last year			0
