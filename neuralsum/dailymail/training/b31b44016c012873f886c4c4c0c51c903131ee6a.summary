one of @entity1 ’s finest heptathletes is chasing @entity2 — her spirited sausage dog — along @entity5 , occasionally pulling him away from an unlikely confrontation with a passing bulldog and feeding him treats he has sniffed out in her handbag			1
‘ i ’m going to get another caramel - coloured one , ’ says @entity12			1
‘ i think i ’ll call it @entity15			2
’ she has a keen sense of humour but her breezy manner has been tested to its limits over recent months			2
a freak foot injury put a premature end to her 2014 season but on a crisp sunny morning on the coast six miles north of @entity24 , @entity12 is in an optimistic mood			1
it is her first day back at training after three months off			1
‘ i ’ve been counting down to this day , ’ she says			2
‘ i just have to trust i can get back to where i was and be even better on a bigger stage			1
i am targeting medals at the @entity42 next year			0
’ despite the injury , which robbed her of the chance to ‘ show the world ’ what she can do at the @entity35 and @entity48 , it was still a breakthrough year			1
@entity12 won her first major senior medal in the long jump and set a world leading heptathlon score to win in @entity53 , the biggest event for multi-eventers outside the major championships			1
‘ if i ’d done all that any other year i ’d have been delighted , ’ she says			0
there are plenty of people in high places backing her to do big things			0
former @entity63 champion @entity62 believes she can not only win heptathlon @entity63 gold in 2016 but also break her own world record			1
@entity67 legend @entity62 predicted the 21 - year - old would surpass her score of 7,291 , which has stood since 1988			1
@entity71 ’s @entity70 , widely considered one of the best athletes of a generation , and @entity1 ’s golden girl @entity75 could not come close			1
former @entity63 champion @entity62 has heaped praise on @entity12 ‘ my mum sent me the link to the online video , ’ recalls @entity12 , ‘ i was watching it thinking , “ what the hell is she saying i ’m going to get a world record for ? ” it ’s crazy to even hear her say my name and such an honour for her to think i ’m capable of getting that			1
i do n’t think anyone ’s capable of getting that , it ’s such an incredible score			0
’ it was a reminder of her towering potential and a confidence boost after a summer of ‘ complete devastation ’ , trying to avoid watching on tv and following on social media as her team - mates competed at the @entity35 and @entity48			1
‘ i was ready to go and post a big score , ’ she says			0
‘ the biggest hit is i could n’t show the world what i can do			1
my whole family was coming to watch me for the first time			0
they ’d made banners , got accommodation and tickets			0
‘ on the day i got the scan on my foot — our medical bills are paid for by the @entity115 — i met my coach in the pub and we decided that i could n’t do the full heptathlon			0
as i was leaving , this guy came up and said , “ i thought i recognised you , you ’re going to do @entity24 so proud at the @entity35 , go win gold girl ! ” @entity12 poses on @entity5 , home of @entity121 ’s @entity115 funded ‘ @entity122 ’ sculptures the @entity1 heptathlete is focused on preparing for next summer 's @entity42 in @entity125 ‘ i turned to my coach and said , “ maybe i will still do it ”			1
but he said , “ you ca n’t chance it over one tipsy fella in the pub ”			2
it just made me think about all the people i was letting down			0
’ she wells up at the memory			0
as her team - mates experienced @entity1 ’s most successful @entity48 in @entity137 , @entity12 could not watch on tv			1
the only positive has been seeing more of her boyfriend @entity139 , a presenter on @entity140			0
she has been to see him @entity141 in @entity143 and the pair have just returned from a two - week holiday in @entity146			2
‘ i used to be an @entity148 head but he ’s got me into hip - hop and urban music			2
we ’ve been doing little day trips to take my mind off things			0
’ @entity12 has also been kept busy by moving out of the house she shared with her mother and grandmother and into her own home , which she shares with @entity2			1
‘ my nan used to do the cooking and my mum used to just look after me to make life easier for athletics , ’ she says			0
‘ i did n’t realise how many dishes have to be cleaned			0
it 's weird being on my own now but i ’ve got my dog and @entity167			2
’ @entity12 ( left ) is looking forward to competing against fellow heptathlete @entity75 ( centre ) @entity12 ’s phone lights up every few seconds with new messages from friends			1
she also shows me an app she uses to keep track of her overall heptathlon score			0
‘ it acts like a calculator			0
you put in your personal best for the seven events and it converts the scores			0
i used to have to use a book to do it , turn all the pages , then write it down and add it up			0
’ it will come in useful as @entity12 focuses on her biggest year yet , with next august ’s @entity42 in @entity125 the primary target			1
by then @entity187 is expected to be back in action after the birth of her first child , @entity190			2
@entity12 has often been branded ‘ the next @entity193 ’ after breaking her @entity1 junior heptathlon record , but she does not feel burdened by the comparisons			1
‘ i do n’t think about it , ’ she says , ‘ every athlete wants to win gold so it ’s not like someone said i ’m like @entity199 so i have to win gold because she did			0
i want to win a gold medal anyway			0
it ’s definitely good @entity199 will be back			2
it ’s scary as well because she is an @entity63 champion and she can bounce back , as she showed after missing the @entity204 in 2008			2
’ two @entity1 athletes on the comeback trail and set for an almighty match - up on the world stage			1
whatever the outcome , the future looks promising for the heptathlon in @entity1			1
as well as funding the @entity214 athletes , every week @entity115 players raise more than £ 33million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grassroots sports clubs and facilities			0
