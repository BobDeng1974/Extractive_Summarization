@entity0 has hit back at insults from @entity3 ’s flamboyant world champion @entity2 by claiming he is more famous than the welterweight known as the best pound - for - pound fighter on the planet			1
and in a neat dig at @entity2 ’s famed macho ego , @entity0 insisted he throws more punches in one round than the unbeaten world champion manages in an entire fight			1
@entity2 , who has earned £ 300million in a unbeaten 47 - fight career , is looking for a super-fight with @entity15 and dismissed @entity0 ’s plea to fight him by claiming the @entity19 fighter ’s ‘ name does n’t carry enough weight ’			1
@entity0 has announced that he will donate the £ 30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity @entity0 posted two pictures of his refurbished gym and clothes from his fight with @entity27 on thursday but @entity0 , back in his native @entity28 after beating @entity27 in @entity29 at the weekend , was in fighting form as he held court at @entity33 boxing gym in his hometown			1
‘ @entity2 says i ’m not a big enough name but i am a bigger name than his opponents @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 put together			1
‘ i am known in places like @entity43 , @entity41 , @entity44 and the @entity45 where they do n’t even know who @entity2 is			2
@entity43 has a billion people , @entity41 has 180m people and i ca n’t even walk down the street there			0
i am bigger than @entity2 in a lot of places and i can help him become more famous , and earn more money			2
’ @entity0 is n’t worried that 36 - year - old @entity2 could catch him out			1
@entity0 was all smiles as he talked to the assembled press at his gym in @entity19 @entity0 is hoping his next fight will be against @entity2 next year ‘ @entity2 throws maybe three hundred punches in a fight , i could manage that in a single round , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity2 will never hurt me			2
i have been knocked down in other fights but @entity2 is not the biggest puncher , not as big as @entity27			1
our fight would be like a game of chess , hit - move			0
it would be about footwork and accuracy , nothing more , nothing less			0
‘ i speak to legends like @entity75 and @entity76 and they say i would beat him			0
even the taxi driver i spoke to in @entity29 said he hoped i would knock him out			2
the people there want to see him humbled ‘ but @entity2 is the boss			2
if he does n’t want to fight me , he wo n’t			0
he ’s not the type of guy where i could just turn up to his house and have a chat about it			0
but maybe all this stuff about me not being a big name is a sign he might be interested , he is starting to promote the fight			0
i do n’t think him and @entity15 will happen			0
’ @entity0 ’s homecoming to @entity93 after wowing the @entity29 fans has been bittersweet			1
his friend @entity95 , who trains in the same gym , suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle after being hit on the head by a concrete slab as he confronted burglars			0
@entity0 lands a left hand during his impressive win on decision against @entity27 @entity0 arrived back in @entity105 along with his wife and daughter on wednesday @entity2 says @entity0 's ' name holds no weight ' and that he will not fight him and the terrorist attack that killed 132 schoolchildren in @entity41 , where @entity0 ’s family originate from , has also affected him badly			1
the £ 30,000 pair of shorts he wore at the weekend , containing a gold waistband , will be auctioned off to raise funds for the survivors			1
talking about @entity95 , @entity0 revealed that he had volunteered to be his pal ’s sparring partner ahead of his world lightweight title shot against @entity121 in @entity105 on january 23 , which has now been cancelled ‘ me and @entity95 are good friends , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i roomed with him as an amateur			0
‘ his trainer @entity125 was at my fight in @entity29 and i told him i would spar with @entity128 to help him because @entity121 is a long fighter , and i have got long arms , i can replicate his style			1
it is probable that @entity2 will insist on fighting @entity15 , an eight - division champion , in his adopted hometown of @entity29 @entity2 age 37 born @entity134 , @entity3 professional debut october 11 , 1996 fights 47 wins 47 @entity136 26 losses 0 draws 0 @entity15 age 36 born @entity138 , @entity139 professional debut january 22 , 1995 fights 64 wins 57 @entity136 38 losses 5 draws 2 @entity0 age 28 @entity142 , @entity143 professional debut july 16 , 2005 fights 33 wins 30 @entity136 19 losses 3 draws 0 ‘ then i got back and found he had been smashed over the head			1
i feel really bad , they have taken away his dream of fighting for a world title and tried to ruin his life , over nothing			0
’ @entity0 admits there must be doubts over whether @entity95 can fight again			1
‘ when you have suffered something that bad , you have to understand the @entity157 might not give him a license			0
it is very dangerous , is it worth that risk ? ‘ we fighters , even me in his position , would want to fight again , but sometimes you have to think of your health first			0
’ the attack on @entity168 follows a knife attack on another potential @entity0 opponent , @entity170 , in @entity171 earlier this year			2
the two incidents were totally unconnected but @entity0 says he is always conscious of trying to stay away from trouble outside boxing			0
‘ i do n’t like fighting , i only do it when i am in the ring , ’ he said .			0
