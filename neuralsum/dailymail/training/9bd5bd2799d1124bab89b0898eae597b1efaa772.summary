@entity0 won for the first time at @entity2 after five previous visits without a victory , while the home side ended the fourth - longest goal drought in @entity8 history			1
but it seems some things never change			0
the @entity0 camp was accused of being verbally abusive by @entity13 manager @entity12 following a bad tempered exchange between the two dugouts in the first half of this thrusting encounter			1
@entity12 threw his overcoat to the ground after someone on the opposite bench made a remark towards him midway through the half			2
‘ it was something said but not by @entity0 , ’ said @entity12			1
‘ he is a great manager , it is fantastic what the guy has done , i would love to learn from him as football manager but i would n’t like to learn things off the pitch from somebody in his dugout			1
i do n’t know what was said - i do n’t speak @entity36 , maybe he does n’t speak @entity38			0
’ @entity13 boss @entity12 ( left ) and @entity39 counterpart @entity0 shout instructions from the touchline @entity39 defender @entity42 celebrates scoring the @entity44 ' winner at @entity2 on saturday @entity42 ( left ) smashes home @entity39 's second goal against @entity13 with his left foot @entity12 also accused @entity0 of trying to ‘ put pressure ’ on him by calling the @entity13 squad , who are without a win at home in the league since early december , one of the best in the top tier			1
‘ i analyse teams by the quality of players and @entity13 have one of the best squads , very good players and a very good bench , lots of solutions			2
’ he even praised the home fans			0
‘ maybe he is trying to put pressure on me , i do n’t know , ’ swiped @entity12 , who also noted @entity0 was already ‘ halfway down the pitch ’ when he went to shake his hand at the end of the game			1
some animosity perhaps remains between the pair after @entity12 refused to shake @entity0 ’s hand when he attempted to leave the pitch before the final whistle when the sides met at @entity78 earlier in the season , a game won 3 - 0 by @entity39			1
after a frosty encounter with journalists earlier in the week , @entity0 was notably subdued throughout the match , rarely straying from the dugout , except to celebrate @entity85 ’s opening goal and @entity42 ’s superb winner			1
but at the final whistle , the @entity87 marched towards the travelling supporters in the @entity2 and asked them for more applause			2
on the day main rivals @entity90 drew with @entity91 , did he sense this was the day @entity39 , who extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points , ran away with the title ? apparently not			2
@entity99 ( right ) of celebrates with @entity101 after scoring @entity13 's first league goal in exactly 11 hours @entity99 and @entity103 run over to the @entity13 supporters to celebrate scoring the goal which ended the drought ‘ in another country i would say fantastic , ’ said @entity0 , ‘ in this country i would say it is difficult , every game is difficult			1
we still have 14 games left and 42 points to play for			0
i think it ’s nothing			0
i am surprised with nothing			0
somebody told me city ’s result after the game but it does n’t matter			0
when you are top of the league you do n’t need other teams to lose points			0
’ @entity12 was optimistic despite a fourth straight defeat and said a major psychological weight had been lifted by @entity99 headed goal in the 48th minute , which ended a barren spell in the top flight of 660 minutes			1
the assist came from @entity101 , who on early impressions looks good value for the £ 3.25million paid to @entity134 for him			0
the @entity135 beat @entity136 down the right flank and whipped an arching ball into the box for @entity99 to pounce on			1
‘ getting a goal is a big moment for us , ’ said @entity12 , ‘ if we get into a run of games where we play like that hopefully we can pick up a lot of points			2
it ’s not just about getting 17th we want to get up as high as we can			0
i just told the players that in the dressing room			0
we were up against team who will be close to winning the @entity154 so it was a good performance for us			0
’ @entity85 slides and clenches his fists in celebration after putting @entity39 ahead against @entity13 on saturday hazard ( centre ) pokes the ball home as @entity13 defenders look on agonisingly as the home side fall behind @entity39 , without @entity164 , serving the second of a three match ban for an apparent stamp on @entity169 ’s @entity168 , and the injured @entity170 , hit their stride quickly			1
@entity85 put them ahead after just eight minutes			2
@entity136 neatly brought the ball to his feet and supplied @entity174 whose angled ball into the box was slotted neatly past @entity177 by the @entity178			0
after equalizing through @entity99 , the home fans erupted into a chorus of ‘ we score when we want ’ but 20 minutes later order was restored as @entity42 nabbed the winner			1
the ever reliable @entity183 struck sweetly with his right foot inside the box , firing into the top corner after @entity99 and @entity187 failed to clear a @entity189 cross			2
@entity39 ’s new signing @entity191 was also given a run out for the final 16 minutes			0
the 26 - year - old from the tropical north coast of @entity195 seemed to enjoy his brief trip to the wind beaten @entity198 , winning a corner with his first foray into the @entity202 game			0
@entity191 ( left ) takes on @entity13 's @entity203 as the @entity195 came on for his @entity8 debut			1

@entity39 beat @entity13 2 - 1 in the @entity8 on saturday
@entity85 and @entity42 netted for the visitors at @entity2
