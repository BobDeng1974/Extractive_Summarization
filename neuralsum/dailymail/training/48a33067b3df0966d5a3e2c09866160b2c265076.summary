by @entity0 for @entity1 injured : @entity2 , 18 , was impaled with a golf club on her second day of college , while attending a fraternity rush party at @entity6 an 18 - year - old was just two days into college when she was sent to the hospital in critical condition after getting impaled with a golf club at a fraternity party			1
@entity2 of @entity14 , @entity13 awoke on thursday and was able to move most of her body , but she still does n't remember the accident that sent her to @entity18 in @entity19			1
according to authorities , @entity2 was attending a rush party at @entity6 's @entity23 fraternity , having a cookout and playing games around 6pm tuesday evening			1
that 's when a 19 - year - old man threw a football at a 20 - year - old man , and the 20 - year - old hit it baseball - style with a golf club			1
but when the club made contact with the football , the shaft snapped and hurled at @entity2 , impaling her in the neck			1
doctors say the club hit a major artery and her spinal cord and initially told friends and family she may be paralyzed			2
but the immediate response of the man who caused the accident may have reduced that threat			0
' his quick reactions probably saved her life , ' @entity2 's best friend @entity50 told @entity53			2
the unnamed student held @entity2 's head up for 15 minutes , applying pressure to the wound , until an ambulance showed up			2
@entity2 was then taken to @entity18 's in critical condition			1
the 20 - year - old who accidentally impaled @entity2 also helped keep her stable until ambulances arrived it was n't until thursday afternoon that she finally woke up , and appeared to have recovered much more than expected			1
' where the club went in , it hit her spinal cord , ' @entity50 said			0
' the way doctors talked about it , it was probably paralysis			0
that 's the best that we were looking at			0
it was really hard to hear			0
but now she 's moving her arms and legs a day later			0
' @entity82 , @entity6 's vice chancellor of student affairs , says he does n't expect charges to be filed in the case since it was an accident			0
the fraternity has since reached out to @entity2 and her family on @entity89 , in apology and the @entity92 sorority held a prayer vigil for the new student			2
the incident happened just one day after classes started for @entity97			0
getting better : @entity2 woke up on thursday and was responsive and able to move , but did n't remember the accident that sent her to the hospital			1
