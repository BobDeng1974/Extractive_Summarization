by @entity0 published : 05:50 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 07:37 est , 4 september 2013 murdered : @entity1 was shot dead in front of 30 people at his local pub but none of the witnesses would identify the killer a coroner has condemned a wall of silence protecting a vicious killer after a father was shot dead in a busy pub in front of up to 30 customers			1
gym instructor @entity1 , 37 , was sat at the bar mourning the loss of his baby daughter to cot death when another regular he had been talking to calmly pulled out a gun and shot him in the back at point blank range			1
as mr @entity1 collapsed to the floor the gunman then shot him again in the body with a .38 calibre revolver before repeatedly kicking and stamping on his head as he lay dying from his wounds			1
up to 30 drinkers at a 3am lock - in witnessed the shooting of the father - of - four at the @entity36 pub in @entity37 , @entity38			1
some rushed him to hospital in a car but he was pronounced dead later from ' catastrophic ' injuries			1
police interviewed all who saw the shooting but despite a £ 50,000 olive branch and offers of being placed in witness protection programmes , all were too frightened to identify the killer and the crime remains unsolved			1
six men were arrested and released without charge			2
at an inquest @entity55 coroner @entity54 criticised the lack of cooperation from witnesses as she recorded a verdict of unlawful killing / ' lots of people know what happened and who was responsible but those people are not giving evidence because they are frightened , ' said mrs @entity54			1
addressing the victim ’s mother @entity70 , she added : ' i understand fear - i am sure you can too			2
but we would both also salute courage			2
' is it not frightening that someone can be brutally killed in a room full of people and no one has come forward to give evidence to bring the perpetrator of the crime to justice ? ' is that not frightening ? i can understand fear for one ’s safety and one ’s family and one ’s children but it is frightening to live in a society where someone can be brutally killed and no one is brought to justice			1
' do we want our children to grow up in an area where that can happen ? i would ask those who are in fear to think about that other fear of living in a neighbourhood where this can happen and then nothing occurs in terms of the perpetrator being brought to justice			2
think about the offer that the police have made for protection to a witness who comes forward			2
' think about that and about the police ’s successful record in protecting such witnesses			2
then think again please about the other fear that this brutal terrible murder can happen in a room full of people			2
i urge someone to come forward so this can stop			2
' the killing in september 2011 occurred on what would have been the birthday of mr @entity1 ’s daughter @entity138			1
she died of cot death when she was just four months old a few years earlier			2
it is thought on the night he was shot dead he had gone out for a drink with friends as he could n’t sleep			1
detective superintendent @entity145 who is leading the investigation into the murder told the hearing : ' at 1.45am @entity1 got a taxi to the @entity36			1
he had initially gone home attempting to stay there but due to his feelings did n’t feel he could stay in the house			2

he arrived at the back door at 2am			1
a police officer saw him			0
he arrived at the back door and was let in by the landlord			1

' the officer added : ' @entity197 has very successful witness protection programme and that would be in place for anyone willing to come forward			0
no justice : a coroner has criticised the lack of cooperation from witnesses over the death of @entity1 ' i would like to express my gratitude to @entity70 and her family			1
murder is hard to go through and even harder when most of @entity37 know who has done it			1
whoever did this to @entity1 will be brough to justice			1
' after the inquest mrs @entity219 , 61 , a senior care home worker was too upset to comment			0
in a statement following her son ’s death she said : ' @entity1 was very popular and i can only put his murder down to the fact he was a really good - looking bloke			1
all this could have been down to jealousy			0
' i just think the killer must have no feelings and no heart			0
i just think they are very dangerous to do that in front of 20 to 30 people			0
what kind of person does that ? it ’s not normal			0
' i know people must be frightened			0
they must be thinking " if he can do that to @entity1 , he can do it to anybody "			1
' but if it happened to one of their family they would be devastated			0
i ’m not angry with them			0
i know they must be frightened			0
if somebody did see it , it must prey on their conscience			0
