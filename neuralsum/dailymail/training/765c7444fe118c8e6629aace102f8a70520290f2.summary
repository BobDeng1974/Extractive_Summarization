the health secretary will tell staff that a culture change is needed to stop cash - strapped hospitals wasting as much as £ 2.5billion a year on needless mistakes the @entity6 could afford to employ tens of thousands of extra nurses if it stamped out basic errors which put patient safety at risk , @entity5 will say today			1
the health secretary will tell staff that a culture change is needed to stop cash - strapped hospitals wasting as much as £ 2.5billion a year on needless mistakes			2
experts estimate that around 755,000 patients – one in 20 – are harmed every year in hospital			1
common avoidable mistakes include bed ulcers , falls , blood clots , drug errors and infections			0
in a speech at @entity25 today , mr @entity5 will tell @entity6 staff that poor care is the ‘ most wasteful and expensive ’ failing made by hospitals – meaning patients suffer complications and longer stays as a result			1
research by independent economists released last night reveals that the average patient who develops a bed sore spends 12 more days in hospital , adding an average of £ 2,500 to their @entity6 costs			2
the report estimates that errors in patient safety cost the @entity6 between £ 1billion and £ 2.5billion a year , including the expense of extra treatment , bed space and nursing , as well as huge compensation payouts			1
this would cover the salaries of at least 60,000 extra nurses			0
mr @entity5 will say : ‘ i want every director of every hospital trust to understand the impact this harm is having not just on their patients , but also on their finances			1
‘ and i want every nurse in the country to understand that if we work together to make the @entity6 the safest healthcare organisation in the world , we could potentially release resources for additional nurses , additional training , and additional time to care			2
’ he will add : ‘ more resources should be invested in improving patient care rather than wasted on picking up the pieces when things go wrong			2
‘ it would be tempting to set up a new target or issue a new ministerial decree			0
but that would be a mistake			0
because the culture change we need to develop has to come from inside , not because hospitals are being forced from the outside			0
eliminating the £ 2.5bn waste would cover the salaries of at least 60,000 extra nurses			0
file picture ‘ if you ’re short of money , poor care is about the most wasteful and expensive thing you can do			1
’ last year the @entity6 spent £ 1.3billion on payouts after being sued by patients over care errors			1
four areas of poor patient safety highlighted by the @entity91 include falls and trips , bed ulcers , urinary infections caused by poorly fitted catheters , and deep vein thrombosis , which together cost the @entity6 an estimated £ 200million a year in extra care			1
but dr @entity99 , of the @entity100 , said the government needs to invest in more staff before patient care can be improved			0
‘ @entity104 and preventable conditions such as pressure ulcers happen when there are not enough staff on a ward to care properly for every patient , not because nurses are unaware that these things should be prevented , ’ he said			0
labour health spokesman @entity113 said : ‘ under @entity114 thousands of nurses and frontline staff have been lost while £ 3billion has been wasted on a reckless @entity6 reorganisation , putting patient safety at risk			2
‘ @entity120 will invest an extra £ 2.5billion to recruit 20,000 more nurses – investment the @entity122 will not match			0

it is estimated around one in 20 patients are harmed every year in hospital
