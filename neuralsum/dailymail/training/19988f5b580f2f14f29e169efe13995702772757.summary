a flash of light from a fiery asteroid is often treated with intrigue when it is spotted on @entity4			1
but scientists at @entity6 suggest that asteroids are smashing into the @entity4 's atmosphere at a higher rate than most people realize			1
according to a new map by the space agency , it 's a wonder we do n't see fireballs raining down from the skies more frequently			2
the orange dots on the diagram show the frequency of asteroids that hit locations during the day while the blue dots show those that hit at night			0
they are measured in billions of @entity41 ( gj ) of energy			0
most space rocks were small and harmless and disintegrated when they hit the atmosphere			1
last year on february 15 , an asteroid which was 55 feet in diameter with a mass of up to 10,000 tons crashed to earth in the @entity52 region in @entity53			1
the moment was captured by bewildered commuters on their dash cams in their cars on their way to work			0
@entity59 : the flash of light believed to be part of a meteor shower was captured by a stunned motorist on their dash cam in @entity67 , @entity68 meteorite : this @entity72 meteorite stone was found in @entity73 in 2000 and weighed 245.4 grams , it sits beside a square cube of 1 cm for scale the flash of light that streaked through the sky in @entity78 before landing in a fiery explosion injured more than a thousand people caused an estimated $ 33 million in damage			0
it was the largest to hit the @entity4 during the agency 's mapping period , according to @entity6			1
and just a few days ago , a flash of light believed to be a meteor was captured by a stunned motorist on their dash cam in @entity67 , @entity68			0
another resident managed to get a photo of the fireball as it sped across the horizon with witnesses saying it had a green glow			0
@entity6 said its @entity29 helps to detect and track space rocks that could cause potential danger			1
according to @entity100 , @entity6 said : ' the new data could help scientists better refine estimates of the distribution of the sizes of @entity29			2
finding and characterizing hazardous asteroids to protect our home planet is a high priority			0
' @entity6 is dedicating more resources to track potentially dangerous space objects just in case there is a time that @entity4 needs to be protected from one			1
it is developing an @entity115 called @entity115 to redirect a space rock into orbit around the moon by the 2020s so astronauts can study it more closely			0
in a move reminiscent of a plot from a @entity124 blockbuster it is also developing ways to deflect an asteroid from @entity4 if one heads our way .			2

@entity6 map reveals the number of asteroids that smashed into @entity4
most were small and harmless and disintegrated
but the @entity29 helps to track dangerous rocks
last year , an asteroid measuring 55 feet in diameter crashed in @entity53
