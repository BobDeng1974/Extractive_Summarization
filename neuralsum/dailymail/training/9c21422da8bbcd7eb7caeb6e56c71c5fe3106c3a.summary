by @entity0 each morning before she gets dressed to go to school , i make sure my eldest daughter @entity4 brushes her teeth , applies sunblock to her face and puts deodorant under each arm			1
it ’s a simple , essential hygiene routine			2
but i ’m aware the last bit might raise a few eyebrows – because my daughter is just seven years old , still plays with dolls and has yet to lose any of her baby teeth			1
in fact , i am sure some who read this will be aghast			2
what sort of mother would i be if i allowed her to be singled out as the smelly child at school ? no sweat : @entity0 has let her seven - year - old daughter @entity4 start using deodorant so she will not be ' the smelly child ' at school especially as it was @entity4 who first noticed that her armpits were a bit whiffy one day back in february – a month after her seventh birthday			1
we ’d arrived home from an afternoon playing in the local park with her sisters @entity37 , six , and @entity38 , four , when @entity4 asked me to take a look at her armpits			1
‘ they feel wet , mum , ’ she told me			2
and when i playfully scooped her up into my arms and gave them a bit of a sniff , i discovered they also smelled of sweat			0
i did n’t make a big deal of it and kept the conversation light , pulling a funny face as i told her : ‘ @entity53 , they smell , we ’d better get you some deodorant , but until we do you can use mine			1
’ i ’m a very matter - of - fact person , however delicate the subject			0
health and hygiene : @entity4 uses a paraben and aluminium - free deodorant @entity4 just smiled at me – it did n’t bother her			1
she watches me get ready every day , so when i handed the deodorant to her and said ‘ here , put some on ! ’ she knew exactly what to do			1
i let her take responsibility for putting it on every morning because she and her sisters need to learn how to look after themselves and develop good habits			1
if she occasionally forgets , i do n’t make a big deal of it			0
although it might sound extreme , i ’m far from unusual			0
parenting websites such as mumsnet are littered with discussions in which perplexed mothers voice concerns that their very young kids need deodorising			0
it ’s not as if i ’m sending her out to the beauty salon to get a spray tan and false nails			0
this is an issue of personal hygiene and dignity			0
as a result of growing demand , there are now several brands on the market for children , such as @entity94 , although most are marketed at kids aged 11 and over			0
many parents choose brands which , although not specifically for kids , use only natural ingredients , including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , the one i buy for @entity4 which is paraben and aluminium - free			1
my sister had breast cancer and there have been suggestions of a link between the ingredients in some deodorants and tumours , so i buy only cosmetic products that are entirely natural			0
@entity4 did n’t have a say in which deodorant she uses			1
i got it from an organic supermarket near our home in @entity119			0
i use deodorant by @entity121 myself , but that ’s too expensive for a little girl			2
i ’m not aware of any of her little friends using deodorant , but give it a couple of years and i expect they ’ll all be using it and wearing their first bras too			2
certainly , much has been written about today ’s children starting puberty earlier – so - called precocious puberty – with studies appearing to show that diet , obesity and the chemicals in our foods are the key influencing factors			0
girls have always developed earlier than boys – on average the onset of puberty happens between the ages of eight and 12 years in girls and between nine and 14 in boys			0
however , i feel @entity4 ’s too young for the dampness and odour to be a pre-cursor to puberty and her body is n’t showing any of the classic signs			1
she ’s simply a very active , energetic little girl who ’s constantly on the go , running around and playing sports such as football			0
so inevitably she ’s going to sweat – and smell – more than children her age who are less active			0
health and hygiene : @entity0 does not think her daughter is too young to start using deodorant , as she does not want her to be picked on at school as a former teacher , and now a psychologist specialising in children ’s and women ’s issues , i know more than most how being singled out as the smelly child at school can have a negative impact on a youngster ’s self - esteem			1
for the sake of a stick of deodorant , i was n’t going to allow that to happen to my daughter			1
kids can be cruel , and if they tell you your teeth are yellow or you stink , it sticks with you throughout your life			0
i can remember every cruel jibe about how skinny and flat - chested i was in my teens , even though i ’m very confident in myself as now i approach my 40th birthday			0
like most little girls , @entity4 loves to perch at my dressing table , exploring the various bottles of perfume and rummaging through the contents of my make - up bag			1
for her , deodorant is just an extension of that – something that her mummy uses every day – the only difference being that she has her own stick that sits by her bed			2
my husband @entity203 is 42 and works in communications in the @entity205 and , like me , he feels strongly that the girls must wait until they ’re teenagers before we allow them to have their ears pierced or wear make - up			0
but there are certain things that can become prematurely essential for some children , and in @entity4 ’s case that is deodorant			1
equally , if @entity4 , @entity37 – who has very dark hair – or @entity38 come to me in the next couple of years and say they ’re very self - conscious because their legs have got hairy , for example , i ’ll talk to them about what we could do about it			1
and , yes , that would include getting them waxed at a salon			0
i ’m dark - haired and began shaving my own legs from eight years old because i was in danger of being picked on at school			2
the most important thing is that @entity4 and her sisters practise good personal hygiene and grow up to be happy , confident little girls who are n’t left in tears in the school playground because somebody told them they smelt sweaty			1
why would i allow that to happen when it can all be solved with a simple stick of deodorant , even if she is only seven years old ?			2

@entity0 *'s* daughter @entity4 , seven , has begun sweating early
as she does not want @entity4 to be *bullied* , she makes her use deodorant
she says she would also wax @entity4 and her sisters ' legs if needed
