the former deputy prime minister said he wanted to pass on concerns that the 86 - year - old monarch was ' overburdening ' herself			1
as a former cabinet minister , mr @entity2 sits on the @entity13			1
in his column for a sunday newspaper , he wrote : ‘ last week a straight - talking yorkie friend asked me what @entity17 do			1
i said we formally advise the @entity5			1
‘ now , my friend is a staunch royalist but he said something which got me thinking			0
‘ his concern was that the @entity5 , who is 87 next month , is overburdening herself			1
he said she had done a remarkable job over her 60 years on the throne but was increasingly concerned at recent cancellations of public duties because of her ongoing ill - health			0
‘ my friend noted the monarch would be delivering her 61st @entity29 in may , where she ’ll announce her future trips abroad , on top of her many other public duties			2
‘ so he asked me , as a @entity17 , to tell her that he did n’t expect her to see out her royal duties as the @entity5			1
she deserves a break and he would n’t think less of her if she stepped down			0
’ mr @entity2 added : ‘ the point is important as we ’ll all become more concerned for the heavy load she continues to carry as @entity39			1
she has given wise counsel to 12 prime ministers , from @entity43 to @entity44 , and has made her mark on the country she loves			2
’ @entity5 looked the picture of health during her visit to the @entity50 this month she recently had to cancel a number of engagements after a bout of ill health but was all smiles during the visit he wrote : ‘ i ’m not sure whether the @entity5 reads the @entity58 , or indeed my column			1
but if you do , @entity60 , i thought i ’d pass on my friend ’s concern			2
‘ he feels you have done so much for the @entity64 and the @entity65 that you deserve to break convention and consider enjoying a long and fulfilling retirement			0
‘ i ’d be interested to hear readers ’ thoughts			0
why not email me ? hopefully i ’ll be able to read them on my phone if i end up in the @entity73 ! ’ last night @entity75 @entity74 lined up to lambast @entity2 over his comments			1
@entity77 said : ‘ @entity2 is the antithesis of the @entity5			1
she is a model of selfless public service and duty			0
he is frittering away any last vestiges of dignity his career had with these sort of pig - ignorant comments			2
‘ luckily for her subjects i ’m sure the @entity5 will ignore his silly advice			2
’ @entity90 said : ‘ @entity91 save us			0
never has this poor nation been more in need of the @entity5 ’s quiet and understated wisdom , leadership and tireless public duty			2
mps @entity98 , right , and @entity100 , left , were among those queuing up to criticise @entity2 ‘ after a decade of @entity102 and @entity2 ’s “ get rich quick ” cronyism , @entity5 ’s reign is one of the few things in @entity64 the public still trust and have confidence in			1
may she long reign over us			0
’ @entity100 added : ‘ i think it is inappropriate for anyone in politics to speculate on the @entity113 ’s health			0
‘ what is clear is that she is very capable of handling a very big schedule			0
under no circumstances will we see the @entity5 abdicate			1
it would undermine the very principle of monarchy			0
she continues to do a fantastic job			0
’ @entity121 said : ‘ @entity2 fails to remember that the @entity5 took an oath to serve for the rest of her life			1
‘ it was an abdication that put her in direct line to the @entity127 , so i do not think that this is viewed by her as an option			0
stop speculating and let her get on with the job			0
’ and @entity98 said : ‘ @entity5 is anointed our @entity113 for life			2
it is a vocation not a job			0
lord @entity2 should remember his oath as a @entity17 and as a peer			2
’ the @entity5 has repeatedly said that she does not plan to abdicate			1
