by @entity0 , @entity1 the jostling began in the bottom half of the women 's draw on thursday with a place in the @entity8 final very much up for grabs			1
although it is the exit of @entity12 that made the biggest headlines , with @entity14 still in the top half of the draw , there is a clear favourite			2
without @entity20 champion @entity19 in the bottom half , things are much more open			1
contender : no 4 seed @entity23 plays a backhand during her third - round victory at @entity8 the highest seed left is @entity28 @entity23 , whose remarkable rise up the rankings made her fourth seed for the tournament			1
last year she was ranked outside the top 50 but seven titles since have turned her into a real contender for the biggest prizes			0
@entity23 , though , has only reached one grand slam quarter - final , at the @entity20 in january , so a semi-final or final would be breaking new ground			1
the 22 - year - old looked in good shape against @entity42 's @entity41 in round two , winning 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 to set up a clash with @entity46 's @entity45			0
asked if she was feeling the pressure , @entity23 said : ' a little pressure , but i want just to stay focused for every match , because here every match it 's very tough			2
' it 's a tough tournament and i have to play my best , to do everything on court match by match , and i will see how far i can go			0
i expect every match to be difficult , so i can not say that i 'm thinking about the finals or something like this			0
' through : @entity23 shakes hands with @entity42 's @entity41 ( left ) after winning in straight sets the direct beneficiary of @entity19 's first - round loss could be 28th seed @entity64 , a 6 - 2 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 winner over @entity67 on thursday			1
the @entity68 is the only seed left in her quarter and next meets @entity19 's conqueror @entity72 , who backed up her big victory by defeating @entity75 @entity74 in three sets			1
@entity64 said : ' i always only look match by match , but when things happen like with @entity19 , everybody sort of approaches you like , " your draw is wide open , you 're going to win the tournament "			2
' you have to stop them , because @entity19 lost for a reason , because there are other good players that can beat you if you 're not at your best			0
it 's not that your draw is wide open			0
' it 's a cliche to say i just look at the next round , but anybody who does anything else is going to lose			0
' tongue out : @entity68 's @entity64 reacts during her three - set victory over @entity67 there are five players left in the bottom half who have made a grand slam final - @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 - with the latter three having won titles			1
@entity103 and @entity104 have both won the @entity8 , and the latter is having her best season since her @entity8 triumph in 2008 and must be a strong contender			1
@entity104 , who overcame a tricky hurdle in teenager @entity112 , next plays @entity113 while @entity103 , always a big danger on clay , takes on @entity102			2
pumped up : former @entity8 champion @entity104 celebrates her progression to the third round another player who will have her eye on the latter stages will be @entity75 @entity121 , who reserves her best form for the grand slams			1
the 15th seed has never made a final on the @entity126 yet has reached at least the fourth round at her last five grand slams , including a semi-final at the @entity20 last year			2
@entity121 again looks to be hitting form at the right time , beating @entity132 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 on thursday			0
asked to explain the discrepancy , @entity121 said : ' if i had the answer for you i would tell you , but i do n't have the answer			0
hitting back : @entity75 @entity121 was on top form as she beat @entity132 in straight sets ' i probably would be doing whatever it is that i do here , i 'd do every week			0
but i just come out and play and compete , and i guess at the slams it 's a little bit better than the other weeks			0
' @entity14 is in third - round action on friday against @entity148 's @entity147 while third seed @entity149 , the highest seed left in the tournament , opens proceedings on @entity153 against @entity154 .			1

the early exit of @entity20 champion @entity19 has opened up the bottom half of the women 's singles draw
@entity28 @entity23 is the highest seed left in the bottom half at @entity163
@entity68 @entity64 is the only seed left in her quarter
former @entity8 champions @entity104 and @entity103 both progressed to the third round
