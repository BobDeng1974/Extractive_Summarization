the up side of them sacrificing decision - making is that their £ 25,000 nuptials will all be paid for			1
the couple won the prize after entering @entity11 competition when it opened in may			1
they won the judges over with their 30 second video which showed them larking around and revealed how much their three children - @entity92 , aged nine , @entity93 , three , and @entity94 , 14 months , wanted their parents to tie the knot			2
they held up signs stating they would love to be bridesmaids and share the same surname			0
now their dream has come true as their mother and father will become mr and @entity106 at a ceremony in october			0
when they tie the knot , @entity6 and @entity7 will have been together for five years , although they have known each other since they were teenagers			1
@entity6 explains : ' we first dated when we were around 17 years old , but it only lasted a month or so and we went our seperate ways and bizarrely never saw each other again , even though we have lived in a five mile radius of each other			2
' it was n't until eight years later , i had a random dream about @entity7 one night , which resulted in me thinking about him and wondering how he was and what he was up to			2
i ended up searching for him on @entity123			0
dream come true : the couple have three daughters who ca n't wait to be bridesmaids after their parents won the prize of a £ 25,000 wedding blushing bride : @entity6 , pictured in the @entity32 dress , says she ca n't wait to get married - even though she has no control over the day ' i contacted him and found that he was severely ill in hospital and was in the process of being diagnosed with @entity137 disease , the same thing i was diagnosed with shortly after we had split up when i was 18 years old			1
' i offered to come into hospital to see him and talk to him about my experience with having @entity137 disease and maybe offer some advice			0
when we met again even though we had n't seen each other in years there was no awkwardness at all and we did n't stop talking until i was kicked out at the end of visiting hours ! ' she added : ' when i left the hospital all i could think about was seeing him again and thankfully the feeling was mutual as we constantly talked for the next week until he was discharged			0
' their relationship went from strength to strength and @entity7 soon moved in with @entity6 and her daughter , @entity159 , from a previous relationship , who was four at the time			1
however , plans for a big white wedding were far from their minds due to @entity7 's ill - health			1
he had to return to hospital for an operation and the couple experienced some financial difficulties			0
@entity6 said : ' the start of our relationship was n't all " hearts and flowers " but we never seemed to struggle , we just got on with fixing all the things that went wrong and putting the pieces back together			0
one of the reasons i think we 're so strong as a couple is because we are constantly laughing together , until this day @entity7 is still the funniest person i have ever met ! ' the couple then decided to try for a baby and @entity93 was born on 3rd may 2011			2
@entity6 then sadly had a miscarriage in 2012 but she was delighted when they then welcomed @entity94 who was born on 10th may 2013			0
@entity7 proposed on christmas day 2013 and now @entity6 said she ca n't wait till the day they officially become man and wife			1
she said : ' we have three beautiful girls and @entity7 and i are still inseparable , i do n't know who is more excited when @entity194 comes home from work , our daughters or me ! ' i can not wait for the day that i can finally call him my husband			2
