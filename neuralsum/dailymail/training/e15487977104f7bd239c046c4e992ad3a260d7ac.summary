by @entity0 @entity1 is a hive of opinion , news and @entity5 but sometimes even the most interesting people can tweet during events or about certain topics that annoy their followers			2
in the not - so - distant future , these users will be able to mute irritating or boring tweets temporarily , rather than blocking the account completely			0
the feature is reportedly being trialled on mobile devices at the same time ceo @entity16 hinted at introducing a ‘ whisper mode ’ for private conversations			1
reports emerged today @entity1 is also trialling a mute option on its apps			1
users said they spotted the feature on @entity24 and @entity26 devices as well as @entity27 , pictured			0
the tool lets people silence users temporarily , but does not block them from sending notifications and direct messages on @entity1 , any user can be blocked			1
this means the blocked user ca n't see the tweets of the person who has blocked them , and ca n't send them replies or direct messages			0
with the mute button , users can be effectively hidden temporarily			0
this means muted people can still tweet and message the user , but their tweets are hidden from the timeline			0
the ' whisper mode ' , on the other hand , will work like direct messages for groups of people , rather than one - on - one conversations			1
@entity16 made the comments during an interview with @entity57 earlier this week			1
‘ there are frequently public conversations that you would like to grab hold of and take into whisper mode			1
being able to move fluidly between that public conversation and the private conversation is something we ’ll make simpler			0
’ private conversations are already possible using direct messages ( @entity69 ) , but these only apply to one - on - one discussions			0
whisper mode would effectively be a group version of @entity69			2
@entity1 ceo @entity16 , pictured , made the comments during an interview with @entity57			1
he said the site was looking at introducing a ' whisper mode ' that would let groups of @entity1 users to talk in private - similar to direct messages but for more people meanwhile , the mute button started appearing across @entity24 and @entity26 devices on the official @entity1 app , as well as @entity27 , earlier today			1
users have been tweeting screenshots of the tool , that lets users silence specific tweeters in a timeline			2
it only appears to have been rolled out to a select few			0
the main difference between the mute tool and the block function is that notifications and direct messages from muted users will still appear			2
@entity1 constantly experiments and rolls out features that do n't always end up becoming permanent features			0
when asked about @entity1 testing , @entity16 said : ' in our latest ios or @entity26 apps , there are well over 100 experiments running in each of those apps			2
