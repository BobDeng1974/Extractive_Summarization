when @entity2 was told that @entity4 ’s promoter @entity3 has put @entity5 on hold for the pair of them to fight on june 13 , his response was as sharp and to the point as the punches which had just pounded @entity11 to defeat in what may prove to be the pivotal fight of his career			1
‘ how can he book a stadium without even talking to me ? ’ @entity2 asked			2
it would be like me sending a message to @entity21 that i ’ve booked @entity5 for next summer and i ’m expecting him to be there			1
’ that said , @entity2 made it clear that he will examine all possible options for a mega-fight with @entity21 or @entity27 before even considering a world championship @entity29 with @entity4			1
@entity30 for @entity3 : @entity4 will be demanding @entity2 and @entity21 by summer @entity2 on his way to a comfortable victory over @entity11 in what was a brilliant performance @entity2 was never troubled as he cruised towards one of the most impressive performances of his career ‘ if i just went ahead and agreed to fight @entity4 it could prevent me ever getting the fight with @entity21 or @entity27 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ they usually box in spring and in the autumn			0
@entity42 in june would rule me out of either of their dates next year – and after that they could both retire			0
‘ that would kill my ambition to prove myself against the very best			0
as far as styles are concerned , i would love to fight @entity4			2
he ’s slower and defensive and he could not cope with my speed and power			0
it would be a huge fight in @entity54			0
but only in @entity54 , not in @entity55 or elsewhere			0
' i want to make a global impact and the way to do that is to fight @entity21 or @entity27			1
’ although saturday ’s brilliant victory represented the last bout on @entity2 ’s contract with @entity66 ’s @entity65 promotions , he says : ‘ i will talk with @entity67 next week about making the super-fights			2
’ but the picture has been clouded by @entity21 ’s sudden announcement that he is ready to meet @entity27 in the richest fight in ring history , in @entity73 on may 2			1
@entity4 wants to fight @entity2 next year but his @entity54 rival is reluctant to commit to the showdown @entity4 celebrates winning his world title against @entity77 in @entity78 in august ‘ @entity79 gave me that news an hour before i went into the ring against @entity11 , ’ says @entity2			1
but it proved i can put distractions out of my mind and focus on the job at hand			0
‘ just as i ’ve done what @entity21 asked by proving that i ’m worthy of fighting him			2
and remember that he said he would fight me earlier this year but it did n’t happen			0
now he ’s saying he ’ll fight @entity27 so we ’ll see what happens			2
’ @entity2 reveals that he has been asked by @entity93 ’s business manager , @entity92 , if he would be interested in fighting the @entity27 : ‘ i said yes			1
’ a match with @entity21 , who stood him up this may , might be easier to make since both he and @entity95 have the machiavellian figure of @entity97 as their advisor			0
but @entity2 remains grateful for all his sparring with @entity27 – when both were being trained in @entity78 by @entity102 – which prepared him for dealing with southpaws like @entity11 in devastating fashion			1
‘ nothing can beat working with – and sometimes hurting – the best southpaw in the world , ’ he says			0
‘ then nothing better than fighting the best boxers on the planet			0
’ @entity2 does not put @entity4 in that category			2
@entity2 wants to fight @entity113 ( left ) next year after proving he belongs with the world 's best @entity2 would also relish a fan with @entity27 ( right ) after his comprehensive win over @entity117 ( left )			1
