by @entity0 published : 02:20 est , 29 march 2013 updated : 09:51 est , 29 march 2013 @entity4 ’s borders should be closed to immigrants while the country ’s own citizens are struggling to find jobs , a group of mps said last night			1
@entity10 and @entity11 , chairmen of the influential @entity10 , said the government should be able to block immigration during periods of high unemployment			1
the two mps , writing in the @entity16 , said @entity4 is facing an influx of people at an ‘ unsustainable level ’ despite the @entity22 ’s measures to reduce immigration			1
@entity4 workers first : mps @entity10 ( left ) and @entity11 ( right ) want @entity27 immigration restricted when @entity4 unemployment is high mr @entity10 is a @entity29 mp who served as welfare minister in @entity32 ’s first government and conservative mr @entity11 was defence minister under @entity33			1
they said @entity35 specifically needs to tackle the @entity27 - which they described as ‘ the elephant in the room ’			2
and they said next year ’s expected wave of immigration from @entity42 and @entity43 means that the need to tackle the issue ‘ could not be more stark ’			1
‘ [ an ] area that needs to be considered is whether @entity27 members should have powers , during periods of high unemployment , to restrict the free movement of labour , at present guaranteed in @entity27 law , ’ the @entity25 wrote			0
the two mps said @entity4 is facing an influx of people at an ' unsustainable level ' , even in the face of the @entity22 's measures to reduce immigration ‘ we will seek to support the tightening of immigration policies in the year ahead , not least to ensure that the public can have confidence in our immigration system			1
’ the @entity25 were reacting to a speech made by @entity35 this week that set out plans to reinforce rules restricting access to benefits , the @entity70 and social housing for @entity73 immigrants			2
they said the prime minister ’s speech sent an important message that should now be built upon - but did not go far enough			0
@entity10 and @entity11 are chairmen of the influential @entity78 on @entity79 they wrote : ‘ although mr @entity35 was criticised on the basis that very few migrants would be affected by his new proposals , this misses the point			0
‘ his purpose , instead , was to ensure that future migrants ( including @entity27 nationals ) are deterred from coming here to seek benefits and services			0
‘ his proposals on changing the entitlement rules for benefits , social housing and the @entity70 are a welcome first step			0
‘ it is right in principle that access to services should be granted on the basis of contribution , and indeed the cross party group has been active in raising these three issues for some time , most recently calling for an entitlement card to access @entity70 services to replace the current system whereby anyone can access the @entity70 after being here for 24 hours			0
’ mr @entity10 and mr @entity11 also confronted those who said cracking down on immigration would undermine economic growth			2
they wrote : ‘ we yield to no one in our desire to ensure that immigration control does not impede the economic recovery on which so much else depends			2
‘ we have been forthright in our view that businesses must be able to bring in the talent it needs , and are campaigning to make the process simpler and swifter			0
