‘ i always feel nauseous - the feeling just overwhelms me			1
‘ i do n’t like the thought of other people ’s sick but my worst nightmare would be to throw up in public			0
‘ i feel safest in my own toilet at home - but if a family member is sick in the bathroom i will avoid using that toilet for over a month			1
’ despite only being sick once every few years , miss @entity33 ’s life is completely controlled by the fear			1
the phobia - known as emetophobia - is so severe that miss @entity2 rarely leaves the house and is unable to work			1
she also struggles to socialise with her friends because of her anxieties she said : ‘ i ’m so scared of being sick so i try to make sure everything is clean and germ free so i wo n’t get ill. ‘ i clean cutlery and dishes all of the time , i will only eat food that is so overcooked it ’s burnt and i do n’t really like to try new food just in case i have a bad reaction			1
@entity9 is the phobia of vomit			1
it is a common anxiety disorder that is most common in women			0
up to three per cent of men and seven per cent of women are thought to have emetophobia			2
people with the phobia fear being sick , especially in public , so often practice avoidance behaviours			2
for example , some sufferers will not leave home when there is a tummy bug going around and will avoid friends or family who are ill. others will observe a strict diet that is free from anything that might cause a stomach upset			2
some avoid medications which list nausea as a potential side effect			0
others avoid pregnancy and alcohol for fear they could make them vomit			1
treatment options include counselling , cognitive behavioural therapy and medication			2
source : anxiety @entity82 ‘ i really want to pass my driving test but i feel car sick and i ca n’t concentrate as i do n’t know where the nearest toilet is			0
‘ my friendship circle is constantly shrinking as i rarely go out and i can never visit my boyfriend ’s house as i worry that i might become poorly			1
’ miss @entity33 ’s phobia started at the age of 11 when she had a sickness bug just before @entity94			0
she was ill for more than two weeks and frantically worried she would n’t get better in time for the festivities			0
she said : ‘ i was only young and @entity94 - like all children - was my favourite time of year			2
‘ but after being ill i was so scared that it would come back and i would miss the big day			0
‘ i do n’t enjoy @entity94 anymore , it just reminds me of throwing up			0
‘ after that i went through a phase where i would even take my own food to eat when my family made me go to restaurants			1
‘ being at school helped as my mind was constantly distracted and although there were still days where i felt sick i had no choice but to be there and get on with it			0
‘ but since i ’ve left college my phobia has consumed me , being at home in my room all of the time has meant my fears of going outside are much worse			2
’ miss @entity2 has been to counselling but so far nothing has helped her to successfully conquer her fears			1
she said : ‘ my dream is to be able to go on holiday and relax and not constantly fret over being sick			0
miss @entity2 is so afraid of germs that she cleans obsessively and insists that all of her food is overcooked ‘ i hope to become a make - up artist one day , but of course that would mean leaving the house and being around lots of different people			1
‘ it just controls me so much , it ’s terrifying			0
’ @entity132 , a clinical hypnotherapist who specialises in phobia treatment , said : ‘ @entity9 primarily affects females			0
i treat around seven females for every male			0
‘ most commonly it starts around the early teens with fussy eating , obsessive checking of sell - by dates on food products , reluctance to eat away from home , fears of social situations , inability to attend school regularly , frequent tummy sensations and a general feeling of being unsafe when not at home			1
miss @entity2 has had counselling but it did not help her to overcome her phobia ‘ recovery is gradual and the symptoms can take from several months to many years to fully disappear			1
‘ it is not a smooth path either - patients will have a few good days followed by a “ blip ” when they feel they have got worse			2
‘ this is an essential part of the recovery process as they learn what the “ tummy feeling ” is and realise that it is n’t always bad			0
‘ believe it or not , this is one of the most common phobias and whilst there are no official stats , some rank it to be around the fifth top in the world			0
