by @entity0 published : 01:03 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 13:59 est , 18 november 2012 when @entity2 wrote the biography of her lover @entity4 , she managed to keep out any hint of their relationship from the book			1
but when @entity10 took on the notorious relationship during the opening sketch of last night 's show , they reimagined it as a significantly more steamy tome similar to bestseller @entity15			0
the irreverent comedy showcase featured comic @entity17 giving a reading of her biography of the former director of the @entity22 , with a surreal erotic twist			0
but she immediately launched into a filthy rendition of her extra-marital liaison with the general , supposedly started when she was shadowing him during his time as head of the western forces in @entity44			0
the extracts began with sincere comments about military matters such as the troop surge and counter-insurgency efforts			0
however , they then descended into aggressively explicit descriptions of her relationship with @entity4 , as she described her telling him , ' you are a dirty girl , @entity55			2
you 're my dirty girl			0
' strong also praised a group of soldiers who ' barely seemed to notice as @entity4 and i went at it like a pair of rutting baboons behind a jeep barely 50 yards away			2
' obviously disgusted by the surreal reading , the sketch showed nearly all of the audience walking out - leaving just @entity69 remaining , with a creepy grin on his face			0
fan : @entity69 played a creepy audience member who was disturbingly titillated by the performance returning to the well : @entity76 played @entity77 in a sketch mocking @entity80 socialite @entity79 the show then turned its comedic guns on @entity79 , the @entity80 socialite who inadvertently exposed the scandal when she reported threatening emails she had received from @entity2 to the @entity85			1
@entity58 read an invented extract from the book describing her and @entity4 spying on @entity79 using a military drone			1
she said that the general asked , ' would you like to be with a woman like that ? ' you know , she has a twin sister			0
' as the sketch became increasingly more explicit , it faded out after @entity58 began another extract saying : ' like most people , i have always had mixed feelings about erotic aspyxiation			0
' @entity104 tossed out a series of witty one - liners about the scandal during the ' @entity109 ' segment of the show , describing it as ' a sexy new reboot of @entity112 '			1
he joked that one of the big winners from the story would be ' whoever writes the next biography of @entity4 ' , as he would be able to include details of the scandal itself , adding : ' reading the @entity122 biography is like reading a biography of @entity124 before his parents died			1
' star : guest host @entity127 played ' @entity128 ' , the ' self - proclaimed mayor of @entity130 ' joke : @entity132 took part in a fake dramatisation of video footage featuring @entity79 @entity104 pointed out that @entity4 ' downfall was an ominous warning for ' people trying to have affairs in the digital age ' , saying : ' you ca n't get away with it - even the director of the @entity22 could n't get away with it			1
' and he mocked @entity79 's involvement as he said her description as a ' @entity130 socialite ' sounded like ' a 1920s euphemism for prostitute ' and quipped : ' sex scandals are like @entity154 @entity153 , eventually they all make their way to @entity80			0
' unsurprisingly , @entity10 returned to the week 's biggest news story later in the show , with @entity76 playing @entity158 's @entity77 in a sketch mocking the media 's coverage of the case			1
he introduces @entity79 - also played by strong - walking out of her house , then shows the video again , commenting that she is ' seen here in the same clip doing the same thing because it 's the only footage we have of her '			2
the seconds - long clip was played several times , then replaced with a deliberately shoddy ' dramatisation ' of the clip with @entity79 played by @entity132			2
@entity76 also conducted an interview with ' @entity128 ' , the ' self - proclaimed mayor of @entity130 ' , played by guest host @entity127 , who when asked about @entity79 would only say , ' she fine , ' and replied to a question about @entity4 and general @entity178 by saying , ' who they ? ' @entity178 was roped in to the controversy when it exchanged that he and @entity79 had apparently exhanged thousands of emails after becoming acquainted while he was serving at @entity184 in @entity44 .			1
