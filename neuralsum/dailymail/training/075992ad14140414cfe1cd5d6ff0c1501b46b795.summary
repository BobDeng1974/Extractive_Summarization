they have appeared in countless news articles and are regulars on tv , but now famous faces have been captured using bacteria			0
celebrities including @entity7 and @entity8 have had their portraits grown using their own bacteria to blur the boundaries between science and art. @entity15 microbiologist and photographer @entity14 created the portraits using a swab covered in bacteria from the celebrities ’ armpits			1
he took a digital photograph of the stars which was made into a negative and placed over a petri dish			0
mr @entity14 then shot through the layers with radiation to burn away the bacteria in places leaving the image to emerge over 48 hours			1
in order to create the portraits , he took a standard digital photograph and turned it into a halftone , which is an image created entirely by dots			2
in a secret process , the image was then used to create a negative and was placed over a petri dish of bacteria			0
mr @entity14 then shot through the negative with radiation to burn away the bacteria in places on the petri dish , according to the shape of the photograph			1
he then placed the photograph in an incubator for 48 hours , to let the @entity56 emerge			2
mr @entity14 is the only person in the world practicing this art , which he calls ' @entity61 ' and this is the first time his work has been brought to the @entity64			2
children 's tv presenters @entity65 and @entity68 also had their portraits created , along with @entity71 star @entity70 and @entity73 presenter @entity72			0
celebrities including @entity7 ( pictured ) have had their portraits grown using their own bacteria to blur the boundaries between science and art the celebrities took part in the experiment to promote the @entity81 , which is designed to enthuse children about science and engineering			1
clockwise from top left : @entity8 , @entity7 , @entity65 , @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity68 @entity14 said that his methods are often a fusion of contemporary artistic and modern scientific practices			0
this close - up of a portrait of @entity24 is not part of the exhibition but shows the level of detail possible using the unusual technique the celebrities took part in the experiment to promote @entity101 @entity64 @entity100 scientists and @entity102 , where the pictures will go on show			1
‘ as a patron of @entity107 , engaging young people in science , technology , engineering and maths is a very big part of what i do , ’ said former countdown star @entity8			0
‘ it was great fun taking part in this project , and the portrait looks brilliant - it 's definitely one of a kind			0
@entity15 microbiologist and photographer @entity14 created using a swab covered in bacteria from celebrities ' armpits			1
@entity8 is pictured a digital photograph of the stars ( including @entity68 , pictured left and @entity65 , right ) was taken and made into a negative before being placed over a petri dish			0
a microbiologist then shot through the layers with radiation to burn away the bacteria in places leaving the image to emerge over 48 hours ‘ i hope that by showing young people the interesting and unusual ways that science can be applied , they 're inspired to discover more about science and engineering careers for themselves			1
’ the fair takes place in march at the @entity144 in @entity145 and is aimed at encouraging young people to get involved in science and engineering			0
mr @entity14 said : ‘ i 'm particularly excited that my work will be a big part of the fair 's central aim to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers - and hope that my work will not only help get young people excited about science but that it will also encourage them to apply the scientific knowledge they gain in fun and unique ways			2
’ the portraits , made in large petri dishes , ( pictured ) took around 48 hours to emerge @entity71 star @entity70 ( right ) and @entity73 presenter @entity72 ( left ) took part in the experiment to promote the fair , which takes place in march at the @entity144 in @entity145 and is aimed at encouraging young people to get involved in science and engineering			1
