@entity0 can resurrect his @entity2 career and prove axed @entity4 boss @entity3 was wrong to sack him last year , according to @entity5			1
@entity6 paceman @entity5 believes @entity4 managing director @entity3 's departure on wednesday night opens the door for controversial batsman @entity0 's return			1
@entity10 - born @entity0 is gearing up for his first county championship action since june 2013 after agreeing a new deal with @entity6			1
@entity5 has backed his @entity6 team - mate @entity0 to make an international comeback @entity5 and @entity0 were all smiles on @entity6 's media day at @entity17 ahead of the new season the 34 - year - old is determined to restart his @entity2 career after he was sacked in february 2014 , and @entity5 backed his county team - mate to achieve that feat. ' maybe that 's the case that those changes open a door , ' said @entity5 of @entity26 's @entity4 exit			1
' they were the guys who were in place that i guess made those rulings that he was n't going to come back and play for @entity4			2
' people have heard things from @entity34 the last few weeks that he might have a chance of coming back			0
' i guess it 's just wait and see , who knows what 's going to happen in the next few weeks , other positions could change within the @entity4 set - up			2
@entity0 cancelled his @entity42 contract in order to play domestic cricket for @entity6 ' but i think @entity0 knows he 's got a chance if he goes out there and scores runs			1
' i think he feels he was harshly treated by being released from the @entity4 a year or so ago , so i think he 's got a point to prove and it will be exciting to see what happens			2
' i do n't see why he ca n't get back into the @entity4 set - up			2
' there 's been a couple of changes over the last couple of days with @entity4 , and i do n't know what 's going to happen there			0
' but i 'm sure if he stacks up a lot of runs then people are going to be pushing for him to get back in the @entity4 side			0
' it will be interesting to see how it unravels in the next five or six weeks			0
the 34 - year - old takes a snap on his phone during the media day at @entity17 on thursday ' but from @entity6 's point of view we 're all hoping he gets out there and scores big runs			1
' @entity0 was back at the @entity17 on thursday for @entity6 's pre-season press day , posing for team photographs			1
the 104 - @entity2 veteran 's @entity4 career went up in smoke during the disastrous 2013 - 14 ashes series in @entity78 , with accusations and back - biting of dressing room unrest			1
captain @entity81 claimed the @entity6 dressing room is ' even better ' with @entity0 around , playing down any chances of the returning star causing any backroom imbalance			2
' i can only comment on things i 've seen with my own eyes , ' said @entity81			0
@entity0 has not played for @entity4 since @entity4 's disastrous @entity89 in 2013 @entity3 was sacked from his position as managing director of @entity4 cricket ' but if you go up into that changing room now , @entity93 will be up there taking the mickey out of someone - and someone will be taking the mickey out of him back			1
' it 's a very nice place to be			0
' i enjoy coming to work every morning			0
' whether @entity93 's there or not it 's a nice place to be , if anything with @entity93 there it 's even better because there 's a bit more banter , a few more of you boys kicking around and there 's a bit more fun to be had at everybody else 's expense			0
' so it 's always been a good place when @entity0 's been around			1
' i think he 's very motivated , and i think there 's a bit of fuel there that 's motivating him on a daily basis			0
' all i see is a young fella , who is desperate to play cricket , and desperate to get back to his absolute best			0
