close to the action : @entity7 space expert @entity20 also talked about animals in space and which countries came second and third in the race to land on the moon , which was one of @entity1 's questions transatlantic message : the engineer was filmed giving a tour of the base and advised @entity1 and his classmates to listen to their teachers , before saying he hoped to see them all ' up in space one day ' space fanatic : @entity1 ' father @entity25 said : ' when i was a kid i wrote to @entity7 and got a brochure , so when @entity1 was doing a project on space i thought we might be lucky if we sent a video of @entity1 asking some questions ' science enthusiast : @entity1 is fascinated by all things science and space so was obviously thrilled when he received the message next , @entity1 wanted to know ‘ who came second and third in the race to the moon ’			1
mr @entity20 said he would place @entity122 second , and @entity124 third – although only the @entity16 has put a man on the moon			0
finally , @entity1 asked if any animals have been sent to the moon			0
they have n’t – but several have gone to space , mr @entity20 said			2
he also explained that his work involves studying planes and rockets and ‘ figuring out how things work ’			0
thanking @entity1 for his ‘ great ’ questions , he added : ‘ it ’s really a lot of fun being an engineer – you get to play with great toys all day and most importantly you get to learn about the world			2
‘ it was n’t easy , though , getting here , i had to work really hard			0
so remember to work hard in school and listen to your teacher			0
