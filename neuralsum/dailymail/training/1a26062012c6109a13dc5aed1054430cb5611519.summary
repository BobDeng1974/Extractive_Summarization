this woman upset me , i could n’t help it			1
i ’m not an emotional person			0
i do n’t really get upset but this shocked me			0
we were all sober and dressed well			0
it did n’t make sense			0
' she added : ' not to toot my own horn , but i did look very nice			0
full make up , hair extensions , a lovely maternity dress , gorgeous jewelery , nails done			0
i really did feel a million dollars			0
' when we arrived at the club there was no queue , however the clip board lady made us wait 10 minutes			1
' fair enough , i assumed it must be busy inside			0
during that time a few people joined the queue but were asked to leave because of trainers and jeans			0
then after 10 minutes the clip board lady asked everyone in our party to put our hands up			0
i assumed this was so that she could let us all in together			0
' no one else had left the club and i thought that was unusual as i 'd assumed a one in , one out system , which would have explained our wait at the door			1
' all the girls were dressed fabulously with designer dresses and accessories			0
the clipboard lady looked everyone in our group up and down and stopped at me : " you ca n't get in here with flats on , " she said			1
i honestly thought she was joking , " i 'm pregnant ! " , i said , and all the other girls chimed in			2
' she laughed again and then said in an extremely arrogant tone : " fortunately when i was pregnant , i was still able to wear heels			1
you ca n't come in "			2

she was wearing these shoes when she was told she could n't enter the club while wearing flats she was left in tears after a staff member at @entity15 , pictured , told her she could not enter wearing flats mrs @entity8 , who is expecting a daughter in late september , added : ' it made me feel like i did n’t belong and should have confined myself to the nursery knitting cardigans for my new arrival rather than supporting my friend			1
i ’ve never been made to feel like that before during either pregnancy			0
' i was having such a nice time in @entity16			1
it ’s such a big city so you expect people to just shove past you but everyone had been unbelievably friendly - holding doors open for me and offering to carry my bag			2
' saturday night soured that and put a dampener on it for the other girls as they were worried about me			0
