dressing the part : @entity16 ( left ) learns the importance of being one of the popular crowd in @entity20 - but is being ordinary better for your mental health ? ' there is a lot of pressure to be top of the social group , but often girls who are popular are n’t well liked - they ’re feared because they ’re dominant , ' she writes in a speech to be given at the @entity29 ’ @entity31 annual conference in @entity32			1
although popular pupils may appear to be part of tight - knit friendship groups , girls who are part of these cliques often turn on each other , as is demonstrated in high school films such as @entity20			1
' one group we studied at a school was very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other , checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that their hair was done properly , ' said professor @entity6 , according to @entity50			1
' there was pressure to be beautiful all the time or you were letting the group down			2
one of the girls was whispered about because her ponytail was n’t how it should be , and it took her all day to realise what was wrong , then she was mortified			2
' girls further down the pecking order do n’t notice how their socks should be			1
grounded : prof @entity6 , left , says girls should not worry about looks all the time , while @entity65 president @entity64 , right , said the idea that popular girls were more respected was ' a myth ' ' if you ’re being picked on that ’s awful , but if you ’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school , keeping out of it			1
' superstar @entity74 last year admitted that she was not popular in high school			1
the @entity77 - winning actress told @entity78 : ' [ i was ] just mediocre , just getting through the hallways with my girlfriend @entity81			2
' we were n't losers , but we were n't popular , we were just coasting , that is exactly what we were doing			2
' @entity86 also revealed that she was n't in the ' in crowd ' at school			2
the @entity77 - winning @entity90 actress - who was a muse for @entity92 and has modelled for @entity94 - told collider : ' i was pretty much a mess out of primary school			1
i was n't really in the popular crowd			2
' i wore really nerdy glasses			0
i was blind as could be , and boys do n't really like big nerdy glasses			0
' there was a really popular girl at my school , and i was obsessed with her ... i 'm so embarrassed to say this , but i was in tears one day , because i could n't sit next to her			1
' prof @entity6 told @entity108 : ' i was bullied at school at times , but at others times i was n't one of those people who would modify my uniform to look cool			1
' because my friends and i were n't cool , the whole aspect of how you look just was n't important to us			0
swanlike : @entity86 has said she was not not popular at school because of her ' nerdy glasses ' ' we found once school in particular in which there was a group of 10 - and 11 - year - olds who described themselves as the " @entity20 "			2
' there was constant observation of who you were talking to , what you looked like			0
' it was so easy to get excluded - one girl came in to school and was told she had failed the " friendship test "			2
she had no idea what that was			0
' on another occasion a teacher found some sellotape stuck deeply into a girl 's hair			0
she said she could tell from the look on that pupil 's face that she was wondering , " who put that there ? "			0
'' @entity64 , president of the @entity65 , told @entity108 that allowing cliques to ' go unchecked ' meant ' setting girl against girl in the wider community			0
' people have this myth that people in these high profile groups are more respected			0
' they look at celebrities as the ideal			0
we believe it is important to ground people and teach them to value themselves			0
' the terms of a cliquey friendship group can change overnight , explains the professor			0
makeover : @entity74 admitted she was not popular at school - but now she is one of the most famous actresses in the world the girls who seem most socially successful can therefore be most at risk of developing emotional or psychological problems , and teachers should react quickly to signs of issues			1
professor @entity6 's research appears to undermine the idea espoused by famous teenage films including @entity175 , she 's @entity176 that unpopular pupils are the unhappiest			1
in middle - class families , she said , it ’s not just about doing well at school but about being all - rounders			0
there is often also pressure to excel at sport , music as well as being top of the class			0
schools emphasise that to stand out from the crowd they must be exemplary human beings as well as doing well at gcses and a levels			0
