by @entity0 a blood test for alzheimer 's disease that would diagnose patients several years earlier than current methods has been developed a blood test for alzheimer ’s disease that would diagnose patients several years earlier than current methods has been developed by @entity9 scientists			1
it would enable sufferers to plan for the future and to spend more time with their loved ones before their memory fades			1
crucially , researchers also hope it will pave the way for a cure by selecting patients in the very early stages of the illness to test new drugs			1
there have been few breakthroughs for @entity27 ’s over the past decade and many treatments which initially showed promise did not work when tested on large groups of patients			0
scientists now think this is because by the time patients were given the drugs , the illness was too far advanced for them to have any effect			1
by diagnosing victims earlier , researchers can test drugs they hope are capable of slowing or halting the illness before it takes hold			1
the new test , developed by a team at @entity45 , works by monitoring the levels of ten proteins in the blood , or biomarkers , which are raised in @entity27 ’s patients			1
a trial on 1,148 elderly patients found that it was 88 per cent accurate in predicting which of them went on to develop the disease			0
the researchers believe the test will be ready to be used on patients in the @entity59 within two to five years at a cost of several hundred pounds a @entity62 recent months scientists have unveiled a number of blood tests that give early warning of @entity27 ’s , including one developed by @entity67 researchers based in @entity68 and another by an @entity70 team based in @entity71 but the @entity9 researchers say their test is more advanced and has been tried on many more patients			1
it would be used on elderly patients with intermittent memory problems , which could be simply due to old age or else the early signs of @entity27 ’s			2
professor @entity80 , who led the @entity9 study , said : ‘ @entity27 begins to affect the brain many years before patients are diagnosed			0
sir @entity84 became a patron of @entity86 in 2008 and donated the charity £ 1m however last week he said ' the @entity88 ' was finally catching up with him ‘ many of our drug trials fail because by the time patients are given the drugs , the brain has been too severely affected			2
‘ a simple blood test could help us identify patients at a much earlier stage to take part in new trials and hopefully develop treatments which could prevent the progression of the disease			2
’ around 800,000 @entity9 have been diagnosed with dementia , including @entity27 , but this will rise to one million within a decade due to the ageing population			0
the @entity9 scientists , whose research is published in the journal @entity111 , will now carry out further studies on their test on up to 10,000 patients to check that it works and to make it more accurate			0
dr @entity117 , head of research at the @entity119 , said : ‘ finding a way to detect dementia before symptoms develop would revolutionise research into the condition			0
‘ however , this research does not mean that a blood test for dementia is just around the corner			0
accuracy would need to be improved before it could be a useful diagnostic test .			0

enable sufferers to plan for the future and spend more time with loved ones
researchers also hope it will pave the way for a cure in early stages
the new test was developed by a team at @entity45
