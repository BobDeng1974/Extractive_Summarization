resplendent in beautifully embroidered dove - grey silk and a striking @entity3 fascinator , the @entity0 was every inch the royal bride when she married prince @entity5 in 2005			1
now the @entity8 ' stunning @entity7 gown is to be the centrepiece of an exhibition opening on saturday at the @entity11			1
and the @entity0 is n't the only aristocratic bride to dust off her nuptial frock for the show			0
also included is the flesh - flashing @entity16 frock worn by @entity17 to her 2012 marriage to @entity20 frontman , @entity21 , and a truly spectacular white silk - satin gown with an 18ft train sported by @entity24 , on her big day in 1933			1
elegant : @entity26 of @entity0 's dove - grey silk @entity7 gown was worn to her 2005 wedding to prince @entity5 and is one of the highlights of the exhibition supermodel style : the @entity34 dress worn by @entity35 when she married @entity36 in 2011 spectacular : the beautiful @entity34 designed dress worn by @entity39 at her 2004 wedding to @entity41			1
his suit , also on show , is @entity44 for @entity45 also on show is @entity35 ' @entity34 dress worn when she married @entity36 and a @entity49 dress @entity50 wore in an episode of @entity52			2
other highlights include the dip - dyed pink and ivory @entity34 - designed dress worn by @entity39 to her 2004 wedding to @entity41 and the unusual purple silk frock in which @entity58 married shock - rocker @entity59			1
the gowns will join dresses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries for an exhibition entitled wedding dresses 1775 - 2014 , which opens on the 3rd may and runs until 15th march next year			1
this @entity49 short wedding dress was worn by @entity50 playing @entity67 in an episode of @entity52 , left , while this purple gown by @entity70 was worn by @entity58 intricate : the back of these dresses reveal the delicate stitching and elaborate embellishment that goes into many wedding dresses among the most striking is a ravishing silk brocade gown worn by a wealthy woman named @entity78 to her 1780 marriage to @entity80			1
equally impressive is the lavishly frilled , embroidered and furbelowed dress sported by @entity83 heiress @entity82 at her wedding to @entity85 in 1890			0
but it 's not all pretty dresses with stellar pedigrees			0
as curator @entity90 explains , the collection also gives an insight into the changing tastes of @entity94 brides over the last 300 years			0
' in the 18th century , the most prestigious fabrics for a bride were those woven with expensive gold and silver metal threads , ' explains @entity90			2
' this was the choice of most royal brides until @entity103 @entity102 married in white satin in 1840			0
@entity105 specialises in ' flower bomb ' dresses like this one @entity108 : pale grey slashed chiffon wedding dress designed by @entity111 and veil by @entity113 , worn by @entity114 for her marriage to @entity116 , left , and @entity118 dress with 3.6			1
metre train worn by @entity120 in 1933 ( which she can be seen in below ) ravishing : the embroidered silk satin wedding dress was worn by @entity24 for her marriage to @entity125 a @entity127 corset that would have been worn under a bride 's dress , left , and a wedding veil with gold detailling pretty : @entity132 and @entity133 leaving church after their 1927 wedding ( left ) and bride @entity136 in a @entity138 coat at her 1970 wedding			1
both dresses are in the exhibition unusual : the daring satin and layered tulle wedding gown worn by @entity17 for her wedding to @entity20 frontman , @entity21 ' however wearing white was also a status symbol			1
in the past white garments were very difficult to keep clean and white was associated with wealth and leisure			0
' although white and similarly pale shades such as ivory and cream remain popular , as the @entity0 's dress makes plain , other hues are becoming increasingly fashionable			1
some brides , among them @entity58 , choose to dispense with lighter hues altogether , while others such as @entity39 and @entity161 opt for subtly coloured gowns			2
' we ’ve got some excellent examples of coloured wedding dresses in the exhibition , ' adds @entity167			1
' among them are a purple dress made by a lady ’s maid in 1899 , a floor - length dress made from colourful upholstery fabric during @entity174 and @entity58 ’s incredible purple taffeta gown designed by @entity70 for her marriage to @entity59 in 2005			2
' but while the coloured dresses are gorgeous , what really catches the eye is the social commentary offered by the rest of the collection ; reflecting , as they do , the social upheaval and changing tastes that characterised the 20th century			0
' the 20th century witnessed rapid social change and increasing economic , political and sexual freedom for women , ' explains @entity167			0
' while most women still wanted a degree of formality in their wedding dress , the traditional codes of dress gradually lost their power			0
beautiful : the corded silk dress worn by @entity198 1890 and the silk brocade gown worn by @entity78 for her wedding in 1780 delicate : silk and leather ' tango ' shoes bought from @entity205 of @entity206 , 1914 and worn by @entity207 for her marriage to @entity209 ' in the 1960s some women celebrated the new freedoms by marrying in mini-dresses and trouser suits and in the 1990s , the plunging , backless , strapless wedding dress became accepted even for church weddings			2
' the etiquette of wedding dress for men also relaxed with more men choosing to wear lounge suits and some buying wedding outfits from shops which targeted a young and fashion - conscious market			0
' modern dresses included in the exhibition show just how much leeway contemporary brides have , with everything from dip dye to cutaway bodices on display			2
' i do love the drama of @entity34 ’s 2002 pink and white dress for @entity39 , ' adds @entity167			2
' it ’s incredibly romantic and slightly shocking : the dress has been designed to make it appear as if the groom has already tried to start undressing the bride leaving her dress in disarray			0
' it ’s also a glorious colour			0
the hem of the dress and veil are drenched in pink which gradually fades away into white			0
i also love the subtle , sensual elegance of the @entity105 and @entity254 ’s pleated dress and coat , made for an unknown bride in 1989 , which the designers paired with veil decorated with roses drawn in silicone rubber			0
' from frilled and furbelowed to silicone and rubber , the dresses on display at the @entity11 might not be your average bridal gowns , but they are certainly fascinating ones			2
wedding dresses 1775 - 2014 , at the @entity11 from 3rd may 2014 until the 15th march 2015			1
