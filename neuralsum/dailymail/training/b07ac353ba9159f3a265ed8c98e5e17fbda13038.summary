and senior @entity6 mp @entity20 said he feared it could see unscrupulous relatives or fraudsters preying on those who cash in pensions			1
mr @entity20 , 79 , said he was worried it could result in threats similar to the @entity3 storyline in which ‘ @entity30 tried to poison his mother @entity31 to get her money			1
the row erupted after shadow work and pensions secretary @entity34 announced @entity6 would not reverse the pensions shake - up			1
but @entity6 sources claimed a ‘ substantial number ’ of its mps , including @entity41 , were opposed to the decision			1
‘ this is a mistake and i ’m sure many @entity6 colleagues share that view , ’ said @entity42 mp mr @entity20			1
‘ the government should n’t have done it and we should n’t be supporting them			0
it could open the way to more old people facing attempts to con them – just like @entity31			0
