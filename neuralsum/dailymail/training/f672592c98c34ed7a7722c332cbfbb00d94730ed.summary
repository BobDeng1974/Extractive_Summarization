the appearance of two rare sea serpents washing ashore beaches on the @entity4 coast in the past week has prompted fears it could be a sign that a natural catastrophe is coming			1
the giant oarfish were dead when they washed up on land , and some scientists believe they come ashore to die because they are ‘ in distress ’			1
the first sea monster , measuring 18 feet , was discovered by a woman snorkelling off the coast of @entity15 on october 13			1
it took 16 people to drag it up onto the beach			2
the second silvery creature , measuring almost 14 feet , came just a few days later on october 18 in @entity21 , @entity4			2
speculation is rife over whether the sightings prelude an earthquake close - up : the head of the 18 - foot - long oarfish that was found in the waters of @entity33 on @entity15 , @entity4 on october 13 giant : @entity35 , which can grow to more than 50 feet in length , are considered the longest bony fish in the world			1
pictured is the 18 - foot one that washed up on @entity15 october 13 @entity35 , which can grow to more than 50 feet in length , are considered the longest bony fish in the world			2
they typically dive more than 3,000 feet deep , which makes sightings rare and has fueled various serpent legends throughout history			0
according to traditional @entity47 folklore , oarfish rise to the water ’s surface before an impending earthquake			1
scientists speculate it is because the bottom - dwelling fish are more sensitive to seismic shifts			1
in 2011 , just a few months before a magnitude 8.9 earthquake hit northeast @entity47 , over a dozen oarfish , known as ‘ ryugu no tsukai ’ in @entity47 , either washed ashore or were caught in fishing nets in the @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity65 prefectures near the quake ’s epicentre			1
scientists , however , say there is no data to support an actual link between the two phenomena			0
@entity73 , who has been studying fish for almost 35 years for the @entity75 of @entity76 , told @entity78 @entity77 that the two sightings this week in @entity4 were ‘ probably just a coincidence ’			1
‘ we think that they come inshore to die actually because they ’re in distress for some reason , but we do n’t know what the reason is , ’ said @entity73 , adding that the fish could have been starving or disoriented			0
the obscure fish that were found last week apparently died of natural causes and tissue samples and video footage were sent to be studied by biologists at the @entity94 , @entity94			0
according to @entity73 , four sightings have been reported since 2010 from the @entity96 southward , including in @entity97 in 2010 and @entity98 in 2011			0
in march 2012 , fishermen in @entity47 reported a sharp increase in oarfish sightings following the massive magnitude - 8.8 earthquake in @entity104 that same month , which marked almost exactly one year before the country was devastated by its own magnitude - 8.9 quake in northeast @entity47			1
the belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters – and even the weather - has been around for centuries			0
anticipate disaster ? a sharp increase in oarfish sightings came just months before a magnitude - 8.9 quake devastated northeast @entity47 in 2011 incredible : an 18 - foot - long oarfish found dead in the water off @entity15 near @entity77 , @entity4 issues in the deep : scientist @entity73 says they believe the oarfish come up to the water 's surface to die ' because they 're in distress ' a mystery : oarfish dive more than 3,000 feet deep , sightings of the creatures are rare and they are largely unstudied in 373 b.c. , historians recorded that animals , including rats , snakes and weasels , deserted the @entity137 city of @entity138 in droves just days before a quake devastated the place			1
accounts of similar animal anticipation of earthquakes have surfaced across the centuries since , such as catfish moving violently , chickens that stop laying eggs and bees leaving their hive in a panic , according to @entity152			0
precisely what animals sense is a mystery , but one theory is that wild and domestic creatures feel the @entity159 vibrate before humans			0
other ideas suggest they detect electrical changes in the air or gas released from the @entity159			0
earlier this year , a record number of sea lion sightings were reported along @entity168 beaches , including one declared ‘ unusual mortality event ’ in april that saw hundreds of ailing sea lion pups washed ashore			2
only time will tell if any of these strange occurrences mean anything			0
a sign ? an ' unusual mortality event ' in april this year saw hundreds of ailing sea lion pups washed ashore an illustration of @entity177 's @entity35 , circa 1850 , the giant fish that inspired tales of sea serpents			2
the 18 - foot oarfish found off @entity4 took 16 people to haul ashore the giant oarfish was first discovered in 1772 by @entity185 biologist @entity184			1
its formal scientific title is @entity188 , but the fish is also known as king of the herring , @entity193 oarfish , streamer fish and ribbon - fish			0
the longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet , however , the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds			1
like the equally mysterious giant squid , the oarfish would go on to enchant fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters			0
the fish lives at extreme ocean depths , between 656 feet ( 0.2 kilometers ) and 3,280 feet ( 1 kilometer ) deep			0
in 1996 , a group of @entity207 found a 23 - foot long oarfish off @entity209 , near @entity210 , @entity4			2
in 1996 , @entity207 pulled ashore this 23 - foot oarfish that was found off the coast near @entity210 , @entity4			2

two huge oarfish were found in the past week off the @entity216 coast near @entity77
the first measured 18 feet and *needed* 16 people to drag it ashore
a few days later a second ' sea monster ' washed ashore measuring almost 14 feet
scientists believe they come ashore to die because they are ‘ in distress ’
however , the two sightings this week in @entity4 were ‘ probably just a coincidence ’ , according to scientist @entity228
@entity47 folklore believes oarfish rise to the water ’s surface before an impending earthquake
scientists speculate it is because the bottom - dwelling fish are more sensitive to seismic shifts
in 2011 , just a few months before a magnitude 8.9 earthquake hit northeast @entity47 , over a dozen oarfish washed shore near the epicentre
the *ancient* ' sea serpent ' legend can grow to 50 feet long and weigh 600 pounds
