by most accounts , 19 - year - old @entity0 was with uncle @entity2 the night of may 30 , 2012 , the last time anyone saw her			1
@entity2 - who was under investigation for horrific sex crimes at the time - died from a bullet within days in what was ruled a suicide			1
the investigation that followed has publicly unraveled what authorities describe as a dark , twisted tale of perversion in the working - class neighborhoods and piney backwoods of coastal @entity15			1
mystery : 19 - year - old @entity0 , pictured with her daughter , vanished in may 2012			1
she is believed to have been involved in a sex ring that involved eight of her adult relatives and three family friends investigation : @entity24 ( left ) committed suicide two days after @entity0 was last seen while his son , @entity26 , has been arrested in connection with the sex abuse allegations accused : @entity0 's mother , @entity29 , is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12 eight of @entity36 ' adult relatives and three family friends have been charged with dozens of felonies in two counties as the alleged members of an incestuous ring that authorities say shared children for group sex			1
@entity2 was the leader , prosecutors say , of what has been described as the largest sex ring ever uncovered in @entity15			1
@entity47 was a victim and likely key witness			0
' @entity0 could have been huge , ' said prosecutor @entity49			2
' she could have corroborated so many things			0
' @entity47 is presumed dead , but authorities have n't found a trace of her and no one is charged in her disappearance			1
even without @entity47 to testify , two of her uncles and an older brother already have pleaded guilty to sex charges , and jurors this month convicted a friend of @entity2 's of multiple sex charges in the first trial			1
others - including the missing teen 's mother , @entity29 , and two aunts - await trial			1
@entity29 denies committing any crime , but says some of her closest relatives are guilty of abusing children , including of abusing her daughter			0
' there are innocent people in this and there are guilty people in this , ' @entity47 , 39 , said in an interview			0
' i do n't know how the judicial system is going to figure it all out because they 're not the sharpest tools in the shed			0
' linked : @entity86 ( left ) , a friend of the @entity47 family , has also been charged , while @entity88 , 32 , became the 11th arrest in the case under suspicion : @entity0 's uncle @entity91 is accused of raping a 13 - year - old girl while the father allegedly looked on @entity29 , accused of having sex with a young female relative , said she had no idea what was going on in the family until after her daughter 's disappearance			1
' the no. 1 thing here is to find @entity0			2
the no. 2 thing is to get all these sick ( people ) off the streets , ' she said			0
authorities are making plea - bargain offers and getting ready for more trials , but questions persist			1
perhaps most troubling , why did n't child welfare workers pursue charges following what prosecutors describe as multiple complaints about sexual abuse within the family going back at least six years ? ' you 'd be surprised how many of them had prior allegations			1
nothing happened , ' said @entity121 , an assistant district attorney in @entity122			0
' you have to wonder what would n't have happened to these children if something had been done			0
and @entity0 might still be alive			2
' the case is so big officials do n't know exactly how many kids inside and outside the family might have been victimized ; estimates range from 11 to 16 children who were as young as 3 or 4 when they were first molested or made to watch adult relatives during drug - fueled orgies			1
the children of the suspects have all been placed in foster care or with relatives who were n't involved in the crimes			2
@entity0 is n't the alleged victim in any of the cases filed so far ; each involved other young people , mostly within her family			1
but the investigation mushroomed only after she was reported missing and her uncle @entity145 had died			1
suspects : @entity47 ( left ) , who 's been charged with second degree sodomy , enticing a child to enter and second degree rape , and @entity0 's brother , @entity150 ( right ) , who 's been charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy authorities believe group sex and child sexual abuse went on for three generations in two families that merged when @entity2 married @entity159 , @entity36 ' sister			1
' @entity145 was the manager			0
he 'd say , ` i 've got this child and this adult , come on over , '' said @entity164 assistant district attorney @entity163			2
@entity0 , meanwhile , led a life that was troubled long before folks on the @entity15 coast came to know her smile because of missing persons fliers posted in store windows and shared on social media			1
the single mother of a daughter born when she was 17 , @entity47 was molested as a child by a step - grandfather who went to prison for the crime , said @entity178			2
before she went missing , @entity178 said , @entity47 was using drugs and had a gun for personal protection while bouncing between relatives ' homes ; others often cared for her daughter			2
disappearance : a smiling @entity0 pictured here with her child a relative reported @entity2 for allegedly abusing one of the family girls in february 2012 , authorities said , and word spread through the clan			1
private @entity196 messages provided to @entity197 by @entity198 , @entity0 's stepmother , show that a female relative informed @entity47 about being raped by three male relatives on may 27 , just three days before @entity47 vanished			1
the night of the disappearance , cellphone records and witness accounts indicate @entity47 left west @entity164 with @entity2 and crossed @entity203 into @entity122 , where @entity2 was found two days later inside his suv by his wife and one of her friends			1
he had been shot in the rear of his head behind an ear , which authorities considered an odd spot for a self - inflicted wound			0
@entity2 was scheduled to be questioned about allegations of sexual abuse the very day he was found in the car on an isolated dirt road			2
@entity47 's cellphone battery was in the vehicle with @entity2 , but there was no sign of the teen			2
her gun was there as well , it was the only gun in the car			0
@entity2 never regained consciousness and died several days later			2
after @entity2 died , relatives and police wondered about @entity47			2
' we did n't even realize she was missing until after they found him shot , ' said @entity198			0
@entity0 was last seen at @entity234 , @entity15 , in may 2012			2

aunts and family friends were eventually charged			1
this month , family friend @entity245 , 50 , was convicted in @entity122 on charges of sexually abusing a girl in the @entity2 family when she was about 12			2
@entity86 claimed @entity2 forced him into the acts against his will , but jurors needed only 20 minutes to return a guilty verdict			0
@entity2 's 35 - year - old wife , @entity253 , is set for trial in early december in what could be a key prosecution			0
court records show she has pleaded not guilty , and @entity121 said she shows no interest in a plea agreement			0
still , authorities wonder how child sexual abuse could go on for years between so many people without anyone being charged until 2012			1
one girl accused an uncle of sexually abusing her as early as 2008 , @entity121 said , but welfare workers found the complaint unsubstantiated			2
' you look at these reports and wonder , ` why ? how did it not go anywhere ? '' said @entity121			0
@entity272 , a spokesman for the @entity15 @entity273 , said privacy statutes prevent the agency from commenting			0
