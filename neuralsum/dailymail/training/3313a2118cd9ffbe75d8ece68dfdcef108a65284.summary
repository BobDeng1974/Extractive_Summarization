by @entity0 published : 14:39 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 6 november 2012 it 's usually a peaceful , very @entity2 county town - but tonight @entity3 in @entity4 is aflame with its annual @entity6 celebrations			2
tens of thousands lined the streets in the small market town to watch the fiery procession , which traces its roots to the 16th century reign of @entity14 and the @entity15			1
it is just one of many november 5 gatherings up and down the country , with the night sky illuminated by colourful pyrotechnics			2
while some will strike lucky with the weather , others wo n't be so fortunate as their fireworks displays are spoilt by torrential rain			1
temperatures are expected to plummet close to freezing , making this the coldest @entity6 in 14 years			1
forecasters said tonight will be the coldest november 5 for over a decade religious connection : the flame procession in @entity3 has its roots in the 16th century			1
in previous years , 80,000 people have lined the streets to watch as many as 3,000 marchers brandishing torches all ages : young participants in the festivities , which also link to the infamous @entity57 against the @entity58 in 1605 step back in time : the shops and buildings on the main streets of @entity3 may have changed , but this is one annual tradition that holds strong showpiece : crowds and marchers gathered around the @entity3 war memorial to light crosses			1
an effigy of @entity71 , who died in 1606 after an unsuccessful attempt to blow up @entity73 , is also burnt the procession , organised annually by six local societies , traces its roots to the 16th century and marks a tumultuous time in @entity2 history			1
a key part of the parade is seventeen flaming crosses , one for each of the @entity37 martyrs burnt at the stake in the town between 1555 and 1557 as part of the @entity87			0
the purge was initiated by the @entity89 monarch @entity14 , who reigned between 1553 and 1558 , and passed strict @entity91 legislation against anyone guilty of heresy against the @entity94			0
@entity95 : this marcher seemed to be creating his own trail of thick red smoke as he made his way through the streets of @entity3 ritual : crowds cluster round as dozens of marchers with burning torches perform a ceremony burn him ! the effigy of @entity71 is carried through the streets to be set alight spooky : @entity111 may have been last week but there were still plenty of scary characters in the parade at least three hundred were martyred in just five years - many meeting a fiery end on the stake and others hung , drawn and quartered			1
it is just a part of a number of parades and displays of pyrotechnics in the town - which can attract as many as 80,000 despite the place only having a population of 16,000			2
an effigy of @entity71 , who died in 1606 a year after an unsuccessful plot to blow up the @entity58 with @entity132			0
the @entity3 event has previously courted controversy - in 2001 , an effigy of @entity134 attracted national attention , as did the 2003 choice of a gypsy caravan			0
a fiery history : the seventeen flaming crosses in the parade represent the 17 martyrs who were burnt at the stake in @entity3 as part of the @entity147 persecutions against @entity37 in the reign of @entity14 history lesson : the @entity151 celebrations mark , in part , the @entity153 of 1555 - 1557 , a purge of @entity37 religious reformers during the reign of @entity89 monarch @entity157 against the catholic faith was punishable by death , with some burnt at the stake , as in @entity3 , and other hung , drawn and quartered while the flames remained alight in @entity3 , others in the country saw their @entity6 pyrotechnics washed out by heavy rain			2
a number of fireworks displays were cancelled after heavy deluges of rain caused flash flooding in @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 the worst affected			1
it follows the cancellation of a number of large displays over the weekend , including one in @entity178 , @entity179 and in the @entity180 , @entity181			0
in all , the @entity182 issued seven flood warning in @entity2 and @entity184 on monday morning , covering areas of the @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , the @entity189 and @entity190 were also 53 flood alerts in operation			0
in @entity195 , nine adults and six children had to be rescued from a caravan park as flood waters rose on sunday evening			0
the @entity199 fire and rescue service used a boat as part of their operation at the @entity204			0
@entity205 ! two of the marchers taking part in the annual @entity6 celebrations in @entity3 , the county town of @entity4 , this evening			0
dressed in vivid , blood - red costumes and brandishing burning torches , they are participating in an event which can trace its origins to the @entity214 and the burning of 17 martyrs at the stake in the town in the period 1555 - 1557 @entity220 message : preparations in @entity3 have been underway all weekend , with banners hung above the streets followed by the procession @entity225 saw the most rainfall in the @entity227 , with 30mm falling in just 24 hours from 5pm on saturday			1
the @entity170 town would usually expect to receive 100mm of rain in the entire month of november			0
in @entity231 , the @entity230 burst its banks after a severe downpour , while much of the @entity234 saw water levels rise			2
but in the @entity237 , early risers were treated to a spectacular show of nature as fog shrouded the water and trees and snow glistened on the higher peaks			0
dwarfed : walkers on @entity246 early on monday morning appear so insignificant against this stunning backdrop - though their view of @entity249 and the other lakes beneath was totally obscured by mist meanwhile , @entity252 took the stage in front of thousands of shoppers to switch on @entity258 's @entity257 lights on monday evening			1
he was joined by @entity259 and @entity260 to turn on the 300,000 lightbulbs which make up this year 's display on the popular @entity179 shopping street			0
@entity265 switch - on : thousands braved freezing conditions to cram @entity258 as @entity252 turned on the @entity257 lights on monday evening it 's that time of year again : a close - up of some of the @entity257 lights suspended above @entity258 press the button : @entity252 is joined by competition winners to switch on the @entity258 lights video : spectacular ! torchbearers light up @entity3 in anti-papist parade			1

just one of thousands of fireworks displays and events up and down the country

*disappointment* for some in @entity231 , the @entity234 and @entity184 as torrential rain washes out events
