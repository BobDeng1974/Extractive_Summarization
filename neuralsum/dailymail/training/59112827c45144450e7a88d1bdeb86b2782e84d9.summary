@entity1 team principal @entity0 believes drastic changes need to be made to address the financial folly that has led to the demise of two @entity6 teams over the past week			1
@entity0 has long expressed concern at the escalating costs in @entity6 , with organisations such as @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 operating on budgets of Â£ 200 - 300million per year			1
unable to adequately compete , back - of - the - grid marques @entity16 and @entity17 have entered into administration , and the belief is they are unlikely to be seen in @entity6 again			1
the @entity21 team have followed @entity17 into administration this season the soaring financial implications of competing in @entity6 have resulted in @entity1 's future being placed in doubt , although @entity0 claims that whilst precarious , her team 's position is not as bad as @entity17 and @entity16			1
@entity0 is , however , angered by what has occurred , particularly as the teams had the opportunity at the start of the year to address the situation , only to reject @entity35 president @entity34 's plans for a cost cap from 2015 onwards			1
' i 'm beyond the stage of frustration , ' said @entity0			1
' it 's one thing to just talk about this terrible scenario that some teams are not going to be there , but for the people responsible for the sport to have let it come this far is extremely disturbing			2
' what we really need to look at - and we as a team have been saying for so long - is to get the figures right in the sport			0
' it 's a real shame we have turnovers of billions of dollars , yet as a sport , as a community , we are not capable of making sure that 11 teams survive			2
now you try to explain that to somebody			0
' in particular , @entity0 has called for a re-think as to how money is distributed amongst the teams			1
at present , given various agreements and deals between the teams and @entity21 supremo @entity67 , what a marque such as @entity10 receive in revenue outstrips that of @entity16 and @entity17 four fold			1
a security officer takes down the @entity75 flag as the @entity17 factory in @entity77 is closed ' there should be a certain amount that allows each and every team to at least live decently , " added @entity0			1
' no - one is saying you should have the most luxurious standards			0
we should be allowed to participate in the sport			0
' we have put in so much investment in order to reach this level , and that should be respected whereby you get a certain basic amount that is the same for everyone			0
' and given the brands , already so established , a team like @entity10 will attract different sponsors and amounts than ourselves			0
' but at least an environment has been created whereby a smaller team does not have to suffer that much			0
referring to one of @entity67 's oft - repeated comments , @entity0 said : ' it 's pretty outdated to say if you do n't have the money then do n't be in the sport			2
' even small teams are putting a lot of money into the sport - at least for normal people it 's a lot of money			2
' @entity1 team principle @entity0 urges @entity6 teams to have a financial re-think another issue is the self - interest of the larger teams , who possess power that allows them to go against the seemingly greater good of @entity6			1
@entity0 feels if the teams could be united then the sport would benefit , thrive and attract new marques and sponsors			1
' as teams we should first find this collective which is not there at the moment			0
that made us strong in the past , ' said @entity0			2
' we all have at least one common denominator which is to survive in this sport and make the sport something healthy , because we all will attract our sponsors			0
' like it used to be in the past and not too long ago , you had the big ones , the medium teams , the smaller teams and they all attracted very good brands			0
' you could attract them because the product was so good , because people wanted to come into the sport , and not everybody can go to the top three			0
' that 's what we first should focus on before we start pointing here and there			0
