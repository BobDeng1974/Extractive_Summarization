three @entity1 winners have blasted the decision to give this year ’s award to the @entity4			1
in an open letter , archbishop @entity5 , @entity7 ’s @entity6 and @entity8 from @entity9 say that the @entity4 is ‘ clearly not one of the “ champions of peace ” @entity14 had in mind ’ when he created the prize in 1895			1
they insist the 27 - nation bloc ’s values do not match those associated with the prize , and say the prize money of £ 750,000 should be withheld			1
contesting : @entity1 laureate archbishop @entity5 is one of three former winners contesting the decision to give the 2012 award to the @entity4 stating that the @entity4 condones ‘ security based on military force and waging wars rather than insisting on the need for an alternative approach ’ , they add that it has failed to ‘ realise @entity31 ’s demilitarised global peace order ’			1
‘ the @entity36 has redefined and remodelled the prize in a manner that is not consistent with the law , ’ their letter asserts , adding that the committee should respect the original wishes of the prize ’s founder , who died in 1896			2
the trio behind the letter are among the award ’s most respected winners			1
the most reverend @entity5 , now 81 , rose to fame in the 1980s as an outspoken opponent of apartheid in @entity51			0
he received the @entity1 in 1984			0
mrs @entity6 , 68 , won the 1976 prize for her ‘ @entity53 ’ marches during the @entity54			1
in recent years she has also been a noted critic of @entity56 ’s policy towards @entity57			0
mr @entity8 , 81 , is a pacifist , painter and sculptor who won the 1980 award for his defence of human rights against the @entity9 junta			2
their letter was also signed by the @entity68 - based @entity67 , which won the award in 1910 , and several authors , lawyers and peace activists			1
announcing this year ’s award in october , the committee hailed the @entity4 for transforming @entity75 ‘ from a continent of war to a continent of peace ’ in the decades following the @entity76			1
the controversial decision came as a surprise amid @entity75 ’s crippling economic crisis			2
but while acknowledging @entity75 ’s current financial problems and social unrest , @entity36 president @entity84 said the decision was to herald six decades of advancing ‘ peace and reconciliation , democracy and human rights ’			0
former winner : @entity7 's @entity6 , who was awarded the prize in 1976 , has also signed the open letter , which says the @entity4 is not a ' champion of peace ' @entity4 president @entity95 called on all the bloc ’s member states , along with soon - to - be - inducted @entity98 , to send attendees to the ceremony			1
but while @entity103 chancellor @entity102 and @entity105 president @entity104 have said they will attend , @entity101 leads the list of leaders who plan to snub the december 10 event in @entity110			0
eighteen @entity75 leaders have accepted an invitation while six others have declined , the @entity111 said yesterday			0
the @entity31 committee has rarely shied away from controversy with its choice of winner			0
@entity120 president @entity119 won the award in 2009 , despite leading a country that was fighting two separate wars			0
@entity14 , a @entity124 industrialist and inventor , gave only vague guidelines for the peace prize , saying it should honour ‘ work for fraternity between nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses			0
’ a prominent researcher and @entity31 critic @entity139 – who also signed the letter – previously accused the @entity142 jury of gradually widening the scope of the prize to include environmental , humanitarian and other efforts by selecting winners such as president @entity119			2
the complaint led to a formal inquiry to see if the @entity1 jury has deviated from its selection guidelines for winners , but it was later dropped .			0

@entity5 has contested the decision to award the prize to the @entity4 in an open letter to the @entity157
@entity159 laureates @entity6 and @entity8 also signed the letter , which insisted the @entity4 was not a ' champion of peace '
the trio said the *$* *1.2million* prize money should not be paid out to the bloc , which they claim *contradicts* the values associated with the prize
the decision to award the prize to the @entity4 in a year marked by *rioting* amid the *ongoing* @entity175 crisis has already been widely *derided*
