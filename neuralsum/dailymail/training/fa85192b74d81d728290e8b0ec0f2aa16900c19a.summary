' in @entity24 i was very glamorous with my make - up perfectly done , my @entity99 heels and @entity101 bags but at home i had my hair tied back and my jeans and t - shirt on			1
' i was just a girl that came from @entity5 and yet i was living a life of luxury			2
i 'd gone from having threadbare carpets in a council flat to earning £ 3,000 some weeks , it was incredible			2
' to be able to buy my daughter the clothes and toys she 'd always wanted was the best feeling in the world and it gave me a rush to know she could have anything she wanted			0
' at the same time i often felt bad that i worked away a lot and watching her become closer with my mum than she was with me was hard			0
' ' i 'd leave my daughter with my mum and i would go to @entity24 for a week or so to ' work ' and then go back home again			1
in the end i did confess what i was doing to my mum but she said she 'd already guessed			0
' she was terrified thinking i was going to get hurt but that kind of thing never really bothered me			0
i was working for an agency and they would get clients for me			2
sometimes people would ring up randomly asking for blondes or brunettes and other times they would ask for me			0
@entity0 , pictured at age 38 , was a high - class @entity23 call girl earning up to £ 3,000 a week ' you were with people that have a lot of money and were pretty well known - but also people who were criminals and gangsters			2
my clients included a wealthy record producer who once asked me to marry him			0
also the brother of a very famous actor and the son of a very well - known man			0
' i also had gangsters ask for me so i had to have my wits about me			0
the money was great - i was earning thousands each week but the hardest part was knowing that my daughter was missing out on me being her mum			0
' i was partying really hard - sex , drugs , rock n roll			0
my life is very different from how it was			0
