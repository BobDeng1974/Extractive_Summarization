@entity0 2015 will come ' far too soon ' for rugby league convert @entity2 , according to @entity3			1
@entity0 - winner @entity3 believes @entity5 signing @entity2 could struggle to master union 's complexities and break into @entity10 's @entity9 squad in time for next year 's global tournament			1
league sensation @entity2 will swap @entity13 for the south west next month , arriving at the @entity15 on october 15			2
big change : @entity2 , pictured here in action for @entity9 's rugby league side , will become a union player next month when he joins @entity5 @entity5 will pitch @entity2 into action in the centres , with head coach @entity23 still confident the 25 - year - old will flourish in the back - row in time			1
former @entity26 and @entity5 flanker @entity3 , part of @entity9 's triumphant 2003 squad , believes next year 's @entity0 may be just out of reach for @entity2			1
' there 's a lot of interest and excitement around @entity2 's arrival , on how he 'll fit into the @entity5 squad and what will happen with @entity9 , ' @entity3 told @entity37			1
' will they put him straight into the squad ? with the way @entity42 's been i find it hard to imagine that they would include him straight away			0
' going back to 2003 @entity45 had n't played many games for @entity9 going into the @entity47			0
' so there 's always a chance for him , but i think the @entity0 will be far too soon			2
' but that wo n't be down to coaches or other players , it will be down to @entity2 and how quickly he fits into the game			0
concerns : former @entity9 star @entity3 believes @entity2 will not earn himself an immediate call - up to @entity10 's @entity0 squad ' i 'm sure he 'll have been doing his homework on rucking and mauling , offside lines and dark arts , because it 's a very different game			1
' @entity2 pas proved an @entity67 sensation in four years at @entity69 outfit @entity13 , but will have just nine months to handle his code switch in time to make @entity9 's @entity0 squad			1
@entity9 launch their @entity0 bid on home soil on september 18 next year , but head coach @entity10 will have his extended training squad in place by july			1
@entity3 expects @entity2 to thrive in union in the long - term , but believes his line - breaking talents will be best employed from the centres , not the back - row			1
' back - row is such a technical position and there 's such a lot to learn , it 's not just broken - field play , you 've got the breakdown , scrum and line - out , ' he said			0
' i think back - row might be slightly too complicated , and will take some time to learn			0
' @entity89 was moved between six and 12 when he came over from league and it did n't really fit			0
talent : @entity3 thinks @entity2 ( left ) could be a future centre for the national team ' so if they just stick him at 12 and give him the opportunity to play and stick with that , then it will be far better for him than trying to move him into the forwards			1
' i think @entity99 has done pretty well at the breakdown in his transition with @entity5 and @entity9			2
' he 's squat and powerful , so he has the ability to make the tackle , get back to his feet and get over the ball , so he 's been useful there			0
' the technical side of the game is tough , but i 'd imagine they 'll keep it pretty simple for @entity2 at @entity5 straight away			2
' @entity111 ambassador @entity3 got his hands on the @entity113 again at @entity114 , admitting @entity0 fever is already hitting home			2
' i found out for the first time you 're only allowed to handle the @entity0 with your bare hands if you 've won it , ' he said			0
' so that 's a nice touch that just brings home that achievement back in @entity67 in 2003 really			0
' it was such a special part of my life and it 's great to be able to look back on it with very fond memories			0
' i would give anything to play a part in a @entity0 in my own backyard , and hopefully @entity9 can go and achieve something special on home soil			2
' @entity3 was speaking on behalf of @entity111 , @entity132 and @entity133 2015 .			0

@entity2 is swapping rugby league for rugby union when he joins @entity5
he has been spoken about about as a future star for the @entity9 team
but @entity3 does not believe he should play at next year 's @entity0
@entity3 sees @entity2 as a centre for @entity10 's side
