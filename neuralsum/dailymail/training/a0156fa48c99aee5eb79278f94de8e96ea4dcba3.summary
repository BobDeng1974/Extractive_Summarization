the @entity26 are on 30 per cent , down one point , with @entity12 unchanged on 17 per cent and @entity28 on 6 per cent ( down one )			1
in the 2010 general election , @entity1 and @entity26 were neck - and - neck on 37 per cent across these seats			2
however , mr @entity10 led mr @entity14 by 46 per cent to 33 per cent when voters in the battleground constituencies were asked who they would prefer as prime minister			2
six in 10 people claim @entity14 puts them off voting @entity1 , with 46 per cent saying they would rather have @entity10 in @entity37 at the @entity40 party conference in @entity41 , the @entity38 have produced parody beers mocking @entity1 the @entity26 hope to focus the election on voters ' fears about mr @entity14			1
mr @entity10 said yesterday : ' if you want to have a @entity53 referendum , if you want to have immigration control , if you want to get the deficit down , if you want to build a stronger @entity50 that we can be proud of , there is only one option			0
' the choice is really between that government – and we 've got a track record now of getting the deficit down , getting people into jobs , taking a correct line on @entity53 – the choice is that or @entity14 in no. 10 @entity72 with no plan for the deficit , no leadership for our country , no way to get the economy growing , the deficit going up , more borrowing , more spending , more taxes			0
that is the choice , ' he told @entity77 's @entity76			0

but *pollsters* @entity6 *insist* @entity1 now has a ' convincing lead '
