@entity5 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , in @entity8 , has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision			1
@entity5 uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision and when she boarded the bus on wednesday afternoon she had folded the stick under her arm			1
‘ when the bus pulled up i went to get on after a few people and , like i usually do , i folded up my cane and showed the driver my card , ’ @entity5 told @entity16			1
@entity5 , from @entity7 , in @entity8 , was shocked when a bus driver refused to believe she was blind despite showing him her concessions bus pass and cane the bus pass , issued by @entity28 , clearly states ‘ blind person ’ on it			1
‘ it just gets me a dollar off my fare which i thought i may as well use , ’ @entity5 said			1
as she handed over her $ 2 fare the driver refused to take her money as she explained the pass simply gets her a concession fare			1
‘ he said “ yeah but you are not blind are you ? ” and started laughing , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ i said “ are you kidding me ” and he said “ well how did you get on the bus , you can obviously see things ” , ’ she recalled			2
@entity5 ’s hereditary condition , @entity44 , means her eyesight is approximately 170 degrees worse than a person with perfect eyesight and leaves her with no peripheral vision			1
shocked by his assumption that she was lying about being blind , @entity5 told the bus driver she has ‘ five per cent vision ’ and he responded : ‘ that ’s not actually blind is it			1
’ @entity5 's bus pass , issued by @entity28 , clearly states ' blind person ' on it but the driver simply laughed at her the 28 - year - old has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision ‘ i was really shocked			1
i took my money and got off the bus … i should be able to get on the bus without being questioned , ’ @entity5 said			1
‘ i was just devastated			0
i was on my way into town to meet a friend and it ’s taken a long time for me to be confident using my cane and be not judged			0
’ upset and in tears , @entity5 fired off a message on @entity72 to the bus company and was told to call their generic customer service line			2
‘ i said “ hey your bus driver just laughed at me and said i was n’t blind despite having a cane and a card ”			2
they gave me the general @entity83 number			0
’ when @entity5 rang the company in tears she was told they would get back to her in two to three weeks			2
since her story was first published in the @entity89 , the @entity87 bus company has been in touch to apologise			0
@entity5 , a talented artist who drew the above illustration of herself , uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision @entity44 is an inherited , degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness			1
it dramatically effects peripheral vision and is often described as extreme tunnel vision			1
the degeneration is progressive and has no known cure			0
but @entity5 believes there needs to be more awareness around the fact there are varying degrees of blindness			2
‘ i am constantly confronted by people who think blindness is black and white			0
but there is a big variation , ’ @entity5 explained			2
@entity5 has had her cane for around a year and a half and it is n’t known at what rate , or if , her eyesight will continue to deteriorate			2
‘ i have n’t been on a bus since then and i definitely do n’t feel comfortable			0
i also have a card for half price taxi fares so i feel more comfortable using that now , ’ she said			0
since becoming legally blind @entity5 , a talented artist and designer , has battled with not only her difficulty in seeing what ’s around her but also people ’s perceptions of her disability			1
‘ i ’ve always had artistic tendencies but people find it hard to deal with because it ’s such a visual thing			0
it took her a long time before she began feeling confident enough to use her cane ( pictured ) in public ‘ the fact of the matter is i do have intact middle vision and it ’s there and fine and it ’s more than i need to draw illustrations			0
it also means i can work from home and do n’t have to go out , ’ she said			0
@entity5 inherited her @entity44 , which can not be cured , from her father and is considered legally blind			1
in an article she wrote for the website on @entity140 , @entity5 described how ‘ getting around in public became increasingly hard a few years ago ’			2
‘ i was constantly getting in people ’s way			0
people were in a hurry and were huffing and puffing and occasionally swearing at me			0
they were n’t to know , but it made me feel horrible			0
if i bumped into just one person , it would rattle me and ruin my entire day , ’ she wrote			0
the illustrator reasoned : ‘ blindness comes in many , many forms and just because we ca n’t see one thing , it does n’t mean we ca n’t see another			0
