an incredible phenomenon has been captured on video for the first time as washing - up bubbles are shown freezing in mid-air			1
the footage , filmed on cameras four - times sharper than hd , shows a group of children blowing the bubbles in a @entity12 forest			1
as the bubbles hit the air , they crystallise and turn into hollow blocks of ice in slow motion			1
as the bubbles hit the air , they are shown crystallising and turning into hollow blocks of ice in slow motion ( pictured ) the video was directed by @entity29 and @entity30 , and was set in forests near @entity32 in @entity12			1
a series of @entity35 cameras were positioned to captured the bubbles as they hit the air			1
shortly after each appears , the crystal - like structures of the ice are shown forming and bonding together			1
a bubble is formed when a layer of water molecules is trapped between two layers of soap molecules			0
each soap molecule is positioned so one side faces the water , while the other faces away			0
@entity51 , @entity52 ( oh ) 3 , extends the life of a bubble by forming hydrogen bonds with water , which slows down how quickly it evaporates			2
when a bubble is blown , the air inside it is warmed by the air in the blower ’s lungs			0
as this warm air hits the cold air , it contracts to set the surface of a bubble			0
in extreme temperatures , this water layer freezes first , followed by the soap layer - making the walls of the bubble more structurally sound , and visible			2
the difference in air pressure and temperature eventually causes the air inside the bubble to disperse and burst the surrounding later			0
as these structures spread across the bubble , they are is shown creating a solid outer shell			1
the film then records the bubbles shattering and shards of ice falling to the ground			1
director , @entity85 said : ‘ we were blown away by the beauty of the intricate patterns that the freezing of the bubbles ’ surface was creating at very low temperature			1
‘ the feather , flower and star ice shapes were so delicate and mesmerising when they reflected light			2
‘ to bring out all these details in @entity35 was to almost discover a new world , that we did n’t suspect existed			1
’ no special effects or editing were added to the bubbles , and the films were shot in real - time before being slowed down			1
in one shot , an icy bubble is shown as tough enough to be held in a hand			2

this surface is pictured freezing no matter what shape a bubble creates when its first blown , it eventually forms a sphere to minimise the surface area of the structure			0
this shape uses the least energy to form			0

@entity215 was directed by @entity29 and @entity30 in @entity32 , @entity12
they used @entity35 cameras to record crystal - like structures of ice forming
as these structures spread , they are shown creating a solid outer shell
@entity226 then records bubbles shattering , and shards of ice falling to the ground
