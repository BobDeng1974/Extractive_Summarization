one of the greatest puzzles of our age is why , when we can split the atom , blast people into space and send information around the world in the blink of an eye , do we find it almost impossible to open a packet of nuts ? two - thirds of @entity14 have injured themselves in ‘ wrap rage ’ incidents , according to a survey this year by trade journal @entity18			2
and half - a - million people a year need medical treatment for injuries from attempting to get into tin cans , consumer group which ? has found			2
so if you ’re fed - up of losing wrestling matches with packaging , try these easy yet ingenious tips to come out on top … a tin opener for plastic problem : moulded plastic ‘ clam - shell ’ packaging completely sealed around each edge — like that found around many children ’s toys , disposable razors and small electrical products — is the leading cause of frustration , according to which ?			1
struggling with a corkscrew ? a tap on the end of a bottle with a shoe should do the trick as sir @entity52 raged on tv ’s @entity53 last year : ‘ has anyone tried to break into a toothbrush lately ? ’ getting into this sort of packaging is particularly hellish because the plastic is both hard and an awkward shape			1
you ca n’t pull or tear it apart so have to cut into it with scissors — normally at awkward angles to avoid damaging the item you ’ve bought			2
then you have to avoid cutting yourself on the sharp edges you have created			0
solution : grab an ordinary manual tin opener , clamp it on to an outside edge and open as if it were a can			1
but bear in mind the can opener wo n’t go around sharp corners , so in this scenario you ’ll have to slice the packet open in straight lines along each side			1
@entity77 problem : the traditional way of opening a stubborn jar is to bash the edge of the lid on a kitchen worktop — but that can lead to some expensive repairs			0
or , if the seal on the lid breaks suddenly while the jar is being held at an angle , brine or beetroot juice all over your floor			0
solution : there are all sorts of fancy gadgets on the market to solve this niggling problem			0
but save your pennies and try an elastic band instead			0
use a shoe to bang open a bottle if it 's stuck wrap it around the lid , several times if necessary , then twist			1
the thicker bands work best as they give maximum grip — but if you only have thin ones , you can use two or three for the same effect			0
it works because it stops your hand slipping around the edge of the jar and gives you the extra grip and traction you need to twist the lid off easily			0
@entity116 bottle problem : we ’ve all done it — mislaid the corkscrew when we need to open a bottle of wine , or simply forgotten to take one on a fancy picnic			1
solution : stop fretting and grab a shoe			2
remove the metallic wrapping that covers the cork and place the bottle into your footwear so that its bottom sits on the insole , at the heel , and the side is snug against the back ( do n’t use a shoe with any kind of heel or one without some cushioning )			1
place the bottom of the shoe against a brick wall or tree to create a 90 - degree angle then , while carefully holding the bottle in place , start banging gently			1
after a few knocks , the cork should have risen up enough for you to twist it out with your hands			0
this is because the banging motion repeatedly forces the wine against the cork at high pressure , forcing the cork to slowly work its way out of the bottle			2
the @entity159 problem : you ’re desperate for a snack but , try as you might , the plastic packet full of crisps , nuts or sweets just wo n’t open , no matter how much you try to pull the sealed top edges apart			1
solution : if you do n’t have scissors to hand , grab two coins , place them on the opposite sides at the top of the bag ( close together ) and push them against each other			0
the coins will work as makeshift scissors and neatly slice the top open			2
cheers to the mail use your trusty @entity179 to lever off the caps from tricky to open bottles problem : you do n’t have a bottle opener to hand but the thought of expensive dentist bills puts you off using your teeth			1
solution : pick up your trusty @entity179			1
take about four folded sheets and fold in half from top to bottom , repeat — and repeat again			0
finally fold it from left to right just once , and place one of the corners underneath the bottle cap			2
lever the cap off the bottle and enjoy your well - earned refreshment			1
this works because the repeated folding creates a highly dense makeshift tool that can handle the pressure of shifting a bottle cap without buckling			2
@entity203 if you ca n't open a tin just turn it upside down and rub it against a concrete surface problem : it ’s easily done — you go camping with enough tinned food to feed a small army , only to discover you ’ve left the tin opener at home			1
solution : never fear — here ’s an amazing trick that will allow you to get at your food without the need for any tool whatsoever			0
just turn the tin upside down and start rubbing it against a concrete surface ( any will do )			1
the motion will wear away the ‘ lip ’ of the tin that seals it shut			0
after a few seconds , turn it back the right way around and give the sides a squeeze			0
if you ’ve used enough elbow grease , the lid should pop open			0
conquer your @entity233 a staple remove will get a keyring off too problem : getting keys on or off a keyring should be quick and simple but the length of time it takes most of us to achieve this basic feat — and the number of nails we break while trying to do so — makes us wonder if keyrings were actually designed to confound criminal masterminds			1
solution : save your manicure and employ a staple remover instead			0
pinch the teeth of the remover into the middle of the keyring , and the two pieces of metal will part like magic , leaving the perfect amount of space for you to slide a new key in			0
if you do n’t have a staple remover , try inserting a butter knife — which has a thicker blade than a usual table knife — between the rings instead , twisting it gently so they open .			1

to get into tough plastic packaging use a tin opener
use a shoe to bang open a bottle if it 's stuck
your trusty @entity179 can lever off the caps from tricky to open bottles
if you ca n't open a tin turn it upside down and rub it against concrete
a staple remove will get a keyring off too
