by @entity0 pampered and preened , with curlers in their hair and stylists giving each of them a last trim before showtime , this could be backstage at a fashion show or a celebrity gala			0
instead , this is day three of @entity11 2014 , where the great , the good , and the downright bizarre of the canine world gather to indulge their passion for pets			1
from poodles with pigtails , to a pomeranian in a pram , day three of the event at the @entity19 arena in @entity20 has already seen some incredible sights			2
@entity26 : with pigtails in their hair and a dedicated owner giving a final haircut and applying hairspray , these two poodles are given celebrity - style treatment perfect : with their gleaming white fur , dainty bows and sparkling eyes , these two @entity35 dogs @entity36 ( left ) and @entity37 are sure to impress grumpy : as @entity44 the @entity43 has his @entity45 trimmed on the third day of the show , he looks a little less than impressed with the attention he 's getting @entity11 , which started in the @entity50 era in 1891 , is said to be the largest event of its kind anywhere in the world and attracts the beautiful and the bizarre pram : rather than risk spoiling the coats on these dogs on the way in , their owners have instead opted to put them in specially designed baby buggies ready for a closeup : this @entity64 waits patiently while his owner styles his hair ready for his time to shine and a chance to be named @entity70 today it is the turn of the @entity72 of dogs to take centre stage , with breeds such as @entity76 , @entity64 and @entity77 all on display			1
the day 's events will also feature utility dogs - breeds which do n't fit into any other category or whose original use has become redundant			1
the four - day event is the world 's largest dog show , and today features competitions from 9am until 5.15pm			1
categories include agility , freestyle and heelwork to music			2
there will also be various displays from groups including the the @entity94 and the @entity95			0
how do i look ? : a @entity77 , part of the toy dog category , has its fur styled ready for an appearance on the big stage today it is the turn of the @entity104 dogs to take centre stage , with the @entity106 to follow on the final day tomorrow does this fur make me look fat ? this tiny canine is all puffed out after an extensive styling session by his owners at the @entity19 arena cheer up ! : all the waiting around seems to have got the better of this poor pooch who looks thoroughly fed up thirsty work : this pampered pet proves that its not easy being beautiful as he takes a quick drinks break patience : the dog will compete in events such as the obedience category , which sees them follow on their owners heels and lie down for two minutes thursday saw the @entity126 and @entity127 dogs strut their stuff , yesterday featured the @entity77 and hound categories and tomorrow will mark the finale of the competition with the @entity106 - featuring breeds such as @entity133 , @entity135 setters and @entity136			1
there are also a number of events solely for children and their dogs it has changed in ways that couldnâ € ™ t possibly have been imagined when the show was set up in @entity50 times by the late @entity146			0
although it was a very different event in 1891 @entity146 was a great showman and would surely have enjoyed the size and scope of the event today , which is an essential date in any dog loverâ € ™ s calendar			0
@entity155 quality : the dogs get celebrity treatment for the day , and also celebrity attention , as @entity159 arrived to give bulldogs @entity161 and @entity162 a hug flying the flag : if the judges were giving out points for patriotism then this @entity165 would surely walk away with first prize ab fab : this tiny chihuahua , called @entity172 , is the centre of attention as she arrives with owners @entity176 ( left ) and @entity177 a whole lotta love : the gaze on this man 's face shows nothing but love for his two chihuahuas as he sits with them during @entity11 dog tired : spending the whole day as the centre of attention and having your hair done can be exhausting , as this @entity77 terrier seems to be finding out upstaged : while the attention is supposed to be on the dogs , this flamboyant owner manages to upstage her poodle with her pink hair , suede and trainers combo bad hair day ? : caught halfway through preparations for the show this dog makes for quite a striking sight but will hopefully have the mop - top under control soon the dog show is still an important part of the event , celebrating the unique relationship that dogs share with their owners			1
judges are trained to ensure that only healthy dogs win prizes , which in turn encourages the breeding of healthy dogs			0
but the event is now about so much more besides			0
@entity11 is ultimately a celebration of all dogs			2
it celebrates working dogs , such as those in the @entity223 classes or which line up for the @entity224 and @entity226 award			0
it hails hero dogs through the @entity229 competition			0
rescue dogs are celebrated in the rescue dog agility competition and the speed and agility of dogs is celebrated in the ever popular competitions of @entity236 and @entity237 to @entity238			2
international : dog owners travel from across the globe to take part in the four - day extravaganza including @entity243 ( left ) , @entity244 ( centre ) , and @entity246 ( right ) from @entity247 picture perfect : this pair of pomeranians , @entity251 and @entity252 , have travelled with their owner @entity253 from @entity255 for the day nearly ready : after hours of preparation these @entity77 terriers have the final touches applied to their immaculate hair @entity43 dogs named @entity261 ( left ) and @entity262 ( right ) line up either side of cross-breed @entity264 in the centre from @entity266 for prospective dog owners and dog lovers , @entity11 is a prime opportunity to talk to @entity270 , rescue charities and breed experts about how to responsibly buy , train and enjoy life with your dog			1
