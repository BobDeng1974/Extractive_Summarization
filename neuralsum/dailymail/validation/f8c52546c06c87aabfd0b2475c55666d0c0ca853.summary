it was a familiar feeling when @entity1 found himself being towered over by the 6ft 6in @entity3 at @entity6 ’s @entity5 training ground			1
the @entity8 winger , who was on the books of @entity10 as a teenager , had to give up his ambition of becoming a professional footballer because he was ‘ too small ’ to make the grade			1
ironically , the dream of playing at @entity16 transpired through rugby , but an afternoon with @entity3 , @entity18 and @entity19 provided a taste of what might have been			2
@entity1 ( far left ) poses with @entity8 team - mates during a visit to meet @entity6 players ‘ they all dwarfed us , but gone are the days where you have people like @entity31 and @entity32 running around in midfield , ’ said @entity1 at a sponsors ’ cross-code challenge day			2
‘ i was always a better footballer at school — @entity35 was my idol — but i was n’t big enough to make it with @entity10			2
that ’s when rugby took over at about 16			0
‘ it ’s funny how both games have changed			0
now you ’ve got your @entity42 and your @entity43 : small guys who are so skilful			0
’ @entity6 striker @entity18 signs a doll for @entity1 during a visit to @entity5 on friday @entity1 scores a try to help @entity8 to @entity49 glory over @entity50 last weekend @entity1 draws comparisons between the northern and southern hemisphere games , highlighting the superior skillset of forwards in @entity55 and @entity56			2
their lighter emphasis on the breakdown , he says , forces the big men to stand out in the backline and become more clinical in attack			0
the record - breaking final weekend of the @entity63 bucked the trend and , having seen @entity65 beat @entity66 in a 90 - point thriller , @entity1 feels more needs to be done to spice up the competition			1
‘ you need to bring in the bonus point to discourage that conservativeness , ’ he said			0
@entity1 has a laugh as @entity6 goalkeeper @entity19 tries on a rugby skullcap @entity1 was a promising young footballer , pictured here for the @entity75 in his youth the @entity8 wing attempts a scissor kick during a visit to @entity6 's training ground at @entity5 @entity1 , who faces his former housemate @entity81 of @entity82 at @entity16 on saturday , topped the @entity83 try count last season , while this campaign he is ahead of all of @entity65 ’s @entity63 wingers			1
yet it is approaching two years since he played the last of his 14 tests and he has learned not to wait by the phone on the day of @entity92 ’s squad announcements			1
@entity93 and @entity94 ended the @entity63 as @entity65 ’s first - choice widemen , but @entity1 , 31 , has been surprised at the amount of chopping and changing — with @entity98 and @entity99 both drifting in and out			1
@entity1 last played for @entity65 in the test against @entity101 on june 8 , 2013 ‘ there ’s a situation where someone gets dropped after one bad game , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ then another player comes in and then it ’s back to the start again			0
‘ it ’s the coach ’s prerogative but this close to the @entity112 i ca n’t get my head around the fact someone is starting one week and not in the squad a couple of weeks later			2
‘ i ’ve learned not to hold my breath about getting picked			0
my performances show i warrant consideration , but you just have to do your best and then it ’s out of your hands			0
so long as i ’ve got the respect of my peers and team - mates , i ’m happy			0
