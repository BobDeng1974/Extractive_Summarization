by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 20:39 est , 4 december 2013 wildlife workers in boats struggled wednesday to coax nearly four dozen pilot whales out of dangerous shallow waters in @entity6 's @entity5 , hoping to spare them the fate of 10 others that already have died			1
six of the whales were found dead , and four of the whales had to be euthanized wednesday , said @entity14 , coordinator for the @entity16 's marine mammal stranding network			1
at least three could be seen on the beach , out of the water			0
the whales are stranded in a remote area near @entity23 , the western boundary of @entity5 and about 20 miles east of where they normally live			1
beached : pilot whales are stranded on a beach in a remote area of the western portion of @entity5 , @entity6			1
federal officials said some whales have died			0
the marine mammals are known to normally inhabit deep water no chance : a dead pilot whale lies near the beach in a remote area of @entity6 's @entity5			1
federal officials say 10 of the dozens of whales stranded in @entity6 's @entity5 are now dead it takes more than an hour to reach the spot from the nearest boat ramp and there is no cellphone service , complicating rescue efforts			1
' we want to set the expectation low , because the challenges are very , very difficult , ' @entity14 said			0
park spokeswoman @entity49 said rescuers were trying to surround the whales , which were in roughly 3 feet of salt water about 75 feet from shore , and herd them back to sea			1
' they are not cooperating , ' @entity55 said			0
tragic : four of the whales had to be euthanized wednesday , and six others already had died			2
necropsies were being preformed this afternoon in danger : a frantic rescue operation has begun along a remote beach at @entity5 , where 51 whales have become trapped in the shallows and 10 have died workers also tried to nudge the whales out to sea earlier in the day with no success			1
the short - finned pilot whales typically live in very deep water			1
even if rescuers were able to begin nudging the 41 remaining whales out to sea , @entity14 said they would encounter a series of sandbars and patches of shallow water along the way			2
this particular whale species is also known for its close - knit social groups , meaning if one whale gets stuck or stays behind , the others are likely to stay behind or even beach themselves as well			2
' it would be very difficult for the whales to navigate out on their own , ' @entity14 said			0
federal officials were notified about the whales tuesday around 4 p.m. because of the remote location , workers were unable to access the site before dark			2
they arrived wednesday morning and discovered 45 whales still alive			2
officials in boats monitor the scene : the rescue strategy is to keep the whales alive during low tide and then use the rising waters of high tide to get the creatures to swim back to deeper , and safer waters			1
six whales have been rescued so far miffed : for reasons not yet known , a pod of them penetrated the maze of shoals and sand flats on the @entity110 side of the park , cutting themselves off from their usual habitat and food supply ' there were some that were very compromised and in very poor condition , ' @entity14 said			1
four were euthanized with sedatives , and more could be put down thursday if their condition deteriorates , @entity14 said			0
she described the remaining whales as swimming and mobile but said scientists do n't know how long they have been out of the deep , colder water they are accustomed to and could be impacted by secondary consequences , such as dehydration			2
' i do n't think we have a lot of time , ' @entity14 said			0
necropsies were being done wednesday on the deceased whales			0
scientists will look for disease or other signs to indicate how whales got stuck in the shallow @entity5 waters			0
as workers tried to coax the animals to deeper water , at least one could be seen a few feet from shore floating upside down with its head bobbing up and down			1
three to four more could be seen on the beach bleeding			0
@entity150 : officials are pessimistic about the prospects of the 41 that remain , saying they will try to herd them to freedom through a 20 - mile labyrinth of sandbars and shallow water , but that it 's very difficult , particularly in a remote spot twenty - two pilot whales became stranded in @entity6 's @entity162 in @entity163 in 2012			1
residents , state and national officials attempted to rescue them , but only five could be saved			0
' it 's not uncommon , ' @entity55 said			0
' but it 's not something that happens a lot			0
' @entity14 said @entity16 was consulting with experts in different counties with experience in herding whales to see if there were other options , but said she was not optimistic			2
' the outlook ultimately does not look good , ' she said .			0

45 stranded whales may have to be euthanized
the whales are believed to be short - fin pilot whales
they are stranded in 3 feet of water on the @entity110 side of the park
there is a rescue operation in place to help get the whales to deeper water
a *fishing* guide sounded the alarm tuesday after spotting the whales in *distress*
whale experts say such strandings are common
