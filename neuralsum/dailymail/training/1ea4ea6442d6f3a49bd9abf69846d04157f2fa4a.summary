canyons , lakes and mountains have been revealed in the most detailed maps ever made of the hidden world beneath the polar regions			1
surveys of the @entity7 and @entity8 have revealed features buried under the ice including a ‘ mega canyon ’ in @entity12 - bigger even than the @entity13 in the @entity14			1
and data from surveys of the regions has revealed the extent to which @entity8 sea ice is gradually decreasing and how long it might take to disappear			2
the most detailed maps ever made of the land beneath the polar ice caps in the @entity8 and @entity7 have been revealed			1
using various techniques researchers were able to show the elevation of bedrock beneath the ice , highlighting amazing land features ( shown ) the unseen land under the ice was detailed in the new edition of the @entity31			1
while previous maps of the polar regions showed them as mostly near - blank whiteness , the latest data has allowed the appearance of the land under the ice to be revealed			1
and the maps show the dramatic decline in @entity8 sea ice in recent decades as the region is affected by rising global temperatures global warming could be triggering increasingly cold winters in some parts of the world , scientists have claimed			2
they discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures , and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex			0
researchers led by @entity55 from @entity56 found that as oceans heat up and melt the @entity8 ice , warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere			2
the polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the @entity14 last winter , they say			0
dr @entity66 of the @entity67 , the joint lead author on compiling the @entity7 dataset , told @entity70 that if there was no ice at the poles the land would look almost normal			2
‘ if the ice was taken away we would have continental features like mountains and canyons , which we do n’t expect from regions like @entity7 , ' he says			1
the data for the maps was mainly collected using a technique known as radio - echo sounding			0
this involved flying a plane over areas of interest , firing radio waves at the ground below and measuring how much they were reflected			0
and the researchers also used seismic and gravity - wave data to compile the maps			0
the sub-ice maps use bedrock data to show physical features such as the @entity7 ’s @entity97 , which are as large as the @entity98 but completely covered in ice			1
in the @entity7 , the map also shows huge trenches buried under glaciers , including the @entity103 , which reaches a depth of 8,188ft ( 2,496 metres ) , and the location of @entity106 , lying close to 2.5 miles ( 4km ) under the ice sheet			0
the @entity108 , which contains the thickest ice in the world , is also featured on the map			0
at the other end of the world , the map shows @entity12 ’s ' mega canyon ' , which is more than 470 miles ( 750km ) long and 2,600ft ( 800 metres ) deep , running north to south under the ice sheet			1
by comparison the @entity13 in @entity114 is 277 miles ( 446km ) long and 6,000ft ( 1,800 metres ) deep			0
@entity12 's canyon - which was discovered in 2013 and is thought to be older than the ice sheet that covers it - is unnamed , although ' @entity12 ’s @entity13 ' or ' @entity13 of @entity12 ' have been proposed			2
the incredible features appear in the new edition of the @entity31			1
included on the maps is a mega canyon under @entity12			1
it is almost twice as long and more than twice as deep as the @entity13 in the @entity14 @entity12 ’s ' mega canyon ' , which is more than 470 miles ( 750km ) long and 2,600ft ( 800 metres ) deep , running north to south under the ice sheet , is shown here in an illustration from previous data			1
by comparison the @entity13 in @entity114 is 277 miles ( 446km ) long and 6,000ft ( 1,800 metres ) deep the data for the maps was mainly collected using a technique known as radio - echo sounding			0
this involved flying a specialised plane ( shown ) over areas of interests , firing radio waves at the ground below and measuring how much they were reflected to reveal the land hidden under the ice ' it ’s very important to know how much ice there is and what the topography of the bed looks like , as this is one of the main controls on how quickly ice sheets melt with climate change , ' said dr @entity66			1
he said the data in the survey of the @entity7 bedrock was a key component in scientific models that tried to predict future sea level rises			0
' as the world warms with increasing greenhouse gas emissions @entity7 ice will start to melt and cause global sea levels to rise , but the speed and amount of sea level rise is very dependent upon the bed - topography under the ice sheet , ' he continued			2
the new edition of the @entity31 also has a map which includes long - term trends in @entity8 sea ice cover , showing the average summer sea ice extent from 1981 to 2010 , as well as the record low minimum cover in 2012			2
it also shows the minimum extent of the ice last year , 18 per cent lower than the 30 - year average , using data sourced from the @entity179 and @entity180 in the @entity14 which tracks polar ice cover			1
the sub-ice maps used bedrock data to show physical features such as the @entity7 ’s @entity97 ( middle of image ) , which are as large as the @entity98 but completely covered in ice in addition to radio - echo sounding ( shown ) the researchers also measured seismic and gravity - wave data to compile the detailed maps			1
dr @entity66 told @entity70 there were still one or two holes in the data with regards to @entity7 , and there may be even more features hidden underground @entity8 sea ice melts each summer , reaching its lowest extent in september , and the changes to the sea ice cover are seen by scientists as a sensitive indicator of the warming climate			1
dr @entity206 , research scientist at the @entity207 , @entity208 in the @entity14 , said : ' end of summer sea ice extent averages 40 per cent less than it used to be in the early 1980s			0
' the ice is also substantially thinner , about half the thickness on average than during the 1980s			0
' the loss of sea ice results in more energy being absorbed in the @entity8 , contributing to amplified warming compared to the rest of the globe			0
' the previous edition of the @entity223 , published in 2011 , was hit by controversy amid claims by the publishers that 15 per cent of @entity12 ’s ice had melted in little over a decade , an assertion they were forced to admit was ' incorrect '			0
a reworked map of @entity12 also had to be produced after scientists said numerous glaciers could be found where the atlas showed ice - free conditions and the emergence of new land			0
the maps also show the extend to which sea ice is retreating			0
@entity8 sea ice melts each summer , reaching its lowest extent in september , and the changes to the sea ice cover are seen by scientists as a sensitive indicator of the warming climate while previous maps of the polar regions ( pictured ) showed them as mostly near - blank whiteness , the latest data has allowed the appearance of the land under the ice to be revealed			1
and the maps show the dramatic decline in @entity8 sea ice in recent decades as the region is affected by rising global temperatures			2

the most detailed maps ever made of the land beneath the polar ice caps in the @entity8 and @entity7 have been revealed
they show vast mountains , canyons and lakes hidden beneath the ice
the incredible features appear in the new edition of the @entity31 of the world
included on the maps is a mega canyon under @entity12 bigger than the @entity13 in the @entity14 and a mountain range as large as the @entity98
data from the regions could reveal how fast the ice sheets will melt
