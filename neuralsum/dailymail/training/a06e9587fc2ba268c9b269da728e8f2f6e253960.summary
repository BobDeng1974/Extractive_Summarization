by @entity0 published : 02:43 est , 5 june 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 5 june 2012 the birthplace of the human race is @entity3 - our earliest ancestors came to @entity3 in a huge migration 37 - 38 million years ago , before they evolved into present - day apes and humans			1
a team of palaeontologists in @entity11 has found the tooth of a pre-human ancestor - afrasia djijidae , so - called because it forms a missing link between @entity15 and @entity3 - that is very similar another early ancestor found in @entity18			1
four similar teeth were found after six years of sifting through sediment - a find that helps seal @entity3 as the starting point for our species			1

it is very similar another early ancestor found in @entity18 ‘ not only does @entity46 help seal the case that anthropoids first evolved in @entity3 , it also tells us when our anthropoid ancestors first made their way to @entity15 , where they continued to evolve into apes and humans , ’ says @entity43 , @entity45 palaontologist			1
he worked with an international team that included scientists from the @entity56			0
‘ @entity46 is a game - changer because for the first time it signals when our distant ancestors initially colonized @entity15			2
if this ancient migration had never taken place , we would n’t be here talking about it			0
’ paleontologists have been divided over exactly how and when early @entity3 anthropoids made their way from @entity3 to @entity15			1
the trip could not have been easy , because a more extensive version of the modern @entity71 called the @entity72 separated @entity15 from @entity73 at that time			0
while the discovery of @entity76 does not solve the exact route early anthropoids followed in reaching @entity15 , it does suggest that the colonization event occurred relatively recently , only shortly before the first anthropoid fossils are found in the @entity15 fossil record			0
¿ not only does @entity46 help seal the case that anthropoids first evolved in @entity3 , it also tells us when our anthropoid ancestors first made their way to @entity15 , where they continued to evolve into apes and humans , ¿ says @entity43 , @entity45 palaontologist ¿ not only does @entity46 help seal the case that anthropoids first evolved in @entity3 , it also tells us when our anthropoid ancestors first made their way to @entity15 , where they continued to evolve into apes and humans , ¿ says @entity43 , @entity45 palaontologist @entity11 ’s 37 - million - year - old @entity46 is remarkable in that its teeth closely resemble those of @entity93 , a @entity15 primate dating to about the same time			1
the four known teeth of @entity76 were recovered after six years of sifting through tons of sediment near @entity97 in central @entity11			0
details of tooth shape in the @entity76 and the @entity101 fossils indicate that these animals probably ate insects			0
the size of their teeth suggests that in life these animals weighed around 3.5 ounces , roughly the size of a modern tarsier			0
‘ for years we thought the @entity15 fossil record was simply bad , ’ says professor @entity111 of the @entity56 in @entity112 , the team leader and a @entity45 research associate			0
‘ the fact that such similar anthropoids lived at the same time in @entity11 and @entity18 suggests that the gap in early @entity15 anthropoid evolution is actually real			1
@entity121 did n’t arrive in @entity15 until right before we find their fossils in @entity18			2
’ the search for the origin of early anthropoids — and , by extension , early human ancestors — is a focal point of modern paleoanthropology			0
the discovery of @entity76 shows that one lineage of early anthropoids colonized @entity15 around 37 – 38 million years ago , but the diversity of early anthropoids known from the @entity18 site that produced @entity93 hints that the true picture was more complicated			1
these other @entity18 fossil anthropoids may be the descendants of one or more additional @entity3 colonists , because they do n’t appear to be specially related to @entity76 and @entity93			2
@entity140 evidence of evolutionary divergence — when a species divides to create new lineages — is critical data for researchers in evolution			0
the groundbreaking discovery of the relationship between @entity3 ’s @entity46 and @entity15 ’s @entity93 is an important benchmark for pinpointing the date at which @entity3 anthropoids colonized @entity15 .			2

tooth from @entity11 is similar to tooth from @entity18 from 37 million years ago
pre-human ancestors migrated between continents
@entity3 , not @entity15 , is the birthplace of our anthropoid ancestors
