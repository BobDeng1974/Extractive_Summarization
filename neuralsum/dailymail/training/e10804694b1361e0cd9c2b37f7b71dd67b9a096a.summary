indestructible ? new @entity0 will reportedly feature a sapphire screen which is impervious to most damage for millions of us , it ’s one of the perils of modern life			2
you ’re going about your daily business when your expensive smartphone slips out your pocket , hitting the ground with a thud			1
if you ’re lucky , your beloved gadget is fine			2
if you ’re not , the screen is scratched			2
or , worse , the glass is cracked , leaving you with a repair bill that can be more than £ 200			1
is there nothing that can be done , you fume , to make smartphones sturdy enough for the real lives of the people who use them ? at last , some good news is on the way			2
@entity26 , the technology company that has sold an incredible 500 million iphones since they went on sale in 2007 , is expected to launch its @entity29 6 next month			1
and their latest model improves on the versions that came before it in one crucial way : a ‘ virtually unscratchable ’ screen , made from sapphire			0
at least , that ’s the rumour being circulated by technology aficionados online			1
why sapphire ? well , it ’s the second hardest naturally occurring material on earth , after diamond			0
the @entity29 will not technically be the first sapphire crystal mobile on sale in @entity45			1
but if , as expected , it goes on sale here for roughly £ 600 , it ’ll be the first that is vaguely affordable			1
the only sapphire - screened mobile phone currently available here is the @entity55 , a super-deluxe model that costs a wallet - busting £ 6,750			1
the phone also includes a camera made by upmarket manufacturers @entity61 and an audio system designed by @entity63			0
the @entity26 model , on the other hand , will be firmly aimed at the mass market			0
business experts are predicting the company is preparing to manufacture an incredible 75 million @entity69 by the end of this year			0
so how ‘ unscratchable ’ is sapphire ? and is this the holy grail for phones ? theoretically , since the only substance harder than sapphire is diamond , the only thing that could damage a sapphire screen would be a diamond			1
but that would only be true if the screen were of pure naturally occurring sapphire , which it is not			0
it uses man - made sapphire , which is not quite as robust			1
synthetic sapphires can be made in a lab and are almost identical in chemical structure to the real gem stone , only clearer and lighter			0
the respected technology expert @entity91 managed to get hold of one of @entity26 ’s new screens - albeit without a phone attached - and subjected it to a raft of assaults			1
in a @entity100 video which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times , @entity91 slashes the screen with a sharp hunting knife and a set of house keys — and it emerges as good as new			0
‘ the worst blemish , ’ he says studying it afterwards , ‘ was my fingerprints			0
’ he concludes : ‘ basically , as long as you ’re not carrying some high - quality sandpaper in your pocket , you should be good			1
’ damaged screens are certainly a common problem			1
a recent survey of 2,500 @entity29 users revealed that nearly a quarter of them were using phones with a screen that was chipped , scratched or cracked			1
other smartphones are just as vulnerable			0
in an attempt to deal with the issue , some manufacturers have begun using a material called ‘ gorilla glass ’ , which is more scratch - resistant than ordinary toughened glass			1
but ask anyone who has used both gorilla glass and sapphire and they ’ll tell you : sapphire screens are in a different league			1
@entity134 , editorial director of tech website @entity136 , carried out his own tests on a phone with a sapphire screen , attacking it violently with steel wool , coins , a knife and sharp stones			0
none of them left a scratch			0
‘ @entity149 crystal is not a gimmick , ’ he says			0
‘ it really can withstand a lot more abuse than any of the other current materials			0
i had to beat the hell out of it to get it to chip or scratch			0
’ he only eventually damaged the screen when he threw the phone from 3ft in the air on to sharp stones			0
‘ scratch resistance is not the same as impact resistance , ’ he says , pointing out that even water , if sprayed at a high enough pressure , can cut steel			0
@entity134 believes that soon all mobile phones will have a super-tough screen , whether it ’s @entity26 ’s sapphire technology or a rival version			1
after all , pretty much every smartphone you can buy now manages your emails , has a decent camera and a high - resolution display			1
the strength of the screen is likely to be the next battleground			0
risk : everyday life poses a significant - and costly - threat to smartphone users there are , however , two potential problems with sapphire			1
up until now , sapphire screens have been too thick for the manufacturers to want to use them			1
but @entity26 seems to have solved this problem — although they have n’t yet revealed how they have done it			0
the other issue is cost			1
it ’s estimated that a traditional glass screen costs a manufacturer around £ 1.80 per phone ; a sapphire screen is believed to cost around £ 18			1
by the time that extra cost has filtered down to the consumers on the @entity203 , you could be looking at a phone that ’s £ 100 more expensive than a normal glass - fronted model			1
but , inevitably , that premium will eventually go down as the technology goes into mass production			1
@entity210 , editor of the @entity212 technology website , says : ‘ if @entity26 wanted , they could soak up the extra cost — their margins on iphones are very high			1
but it would be strange for a company to choose to do that			0
’ yet price is not everything			0
‘ i think the biggest problem with smartphones are not scratched screens but cracked ones , ’ says @entity210			2
‘ you drop it , it lands on its side and the screen cracks			2
so , if @entity26 has developed a way to make the glass more resistant to that , that ’s going to be the biggest win			0
’ @entity210 adds : ’ the hard part is n’t making one screen that does n’t scratch or crack , it ’s making hundreds of millions of them			0
the biggest challenge will be getting a good quality product when you ’re producing lots of them - and at a cost that does n’t make the phone unaffordable			1
’ that said , the cost of maintaining a phone with a non-sapphire screen can also be high			2
currently , @entity26 charges £ 216 to put a new screen on a cracked @entity250 , though small mobile - phone shops often carry out unofficial repairs for around half that amount			1
but £ 100 is still a lot of money for fitting what is essentially a piece of glass			2
it ’s no wonder that there are video ‘ tutorials ’ on @entity100 for those who want to buy a new screen online and repair their phones at home			2
the steep cost of repairs is also why so many smartphone users choose to just buy a new phone instead of fixing their old one			2
and why so many of us stick our beautifully crafted pieces of engineering inside an ugly , plastic protective case			0
many also attach a cheap ‘ screen protector ’ ( a sheet of clear , adhesive plastic ) on the front to help guard the phone from scratches			2
as @entity210 says : ‘ at the moment you ’re a bit stuck : either you enjoy your beautiful phone and accept that after a couple of years it ’s going to be scratched and you throw it away - or you wrap it up in a case and ca n’t enjoy the aesthetics that probably made you buy it in the first place			2
’ that is , however , before the arrival of sapphire			0
if sapphire screens live up to their promise , your mobile phone will be almost indestructible			2
just make sure you keep it away from your diamond engagement ring .			0

everyday scratches and cracks in screens can cost more than £ 200 to fix
so far phones have proved difficult - and expensive - to proof against harm
but new technology - rumoured to be in next @entity29 - could change that
