by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 if @entity2 had his doubters after losing three straight @entity5 finals then so did the man who coached him to the @entity9 title on sunday - @entity10			1
so for the 46 - year - old @entity12 there was a particular pleasure in proving wrong those who believed his appointment was a gimmick , or merely an attempt to copy @entity19 in his choice of @entity21			1
@entity10 came out on top of sunday ’s coaching face - off with his old rival @entity24 , but he believes that today ’s stars hiring those of yesteryear was always going to make sense			1

‘ i think it was time for the top players to understand that if they want to improve			2

if it ’s successful , if my wife allows me to be travelling like that and behave like a 25 - year - old , then sure it could			1
@entity2 and i have an unbelievable amount of respect for one another			2
but friends ? i would rather not go with him on a bachelor weekend in @entity71 , put it that way			0
‘ i remember how i felt ( winning @entity74 ) and this has n’t happened for a long time that i remembered how i felt on the court			0
i noticed emotions that i have n’t felt in a long time and that ’s a driving force			0
