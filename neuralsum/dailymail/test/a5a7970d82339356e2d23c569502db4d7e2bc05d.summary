@entity0 claimed all three points against @entity3 play - off hopefuls @entity2 with a 1 - 0 win thanks to @entity6 's second - half goal			1
with both teams playing with high defensive lines at @entity11 there were a high number of long balls attempted by each side but , with few finding their mark , the game produced nothing of note for the vast majority of the first half			2
it took until the 35th minute for a decent chance to present itself when a whipped cross found @entity23 in the box but the @entity26 striker could not wrap his foot around it and the ball sailed wide of the post			0
@entity6 ( second left ) opens the scoring for @entity0 with the only goal for the game @entity6 ( right ) is mobbed by his team - mates after he scores the first goal for the home side the second half started in a livelier fashion to the first and that was evident after 49 minutes when some clever play from @entity2 around the box presented @entity42 with an opportunity to get a shot on goal but his effort skimmed agonisingly past the post			1
however , the promise of exciting football and the chance of goals petered out as the half wore on			2
both sides managed to work themselves into good areas but could not produce the final pass to create clear - cut scoring opportunities			0
a mistake from @entity58 looked as though it had gifted wednesday with a sure - fire goal			2
@entity60 collected the ball and made a run towards goal with @entity64 at his side but the pair could not make the two - on - one situation count as @entity69 ' lay - off to @entity64 was hit straight into the midriff of @entity71			0
@entity72 ( right ) is dejected after missing a chance as wednesday keeper @entity74 looks relieved @entity75 watches on as his @entity2 side lose and suffer a blow to their promotion hopes the breakthrough finally came in the 75th minute when @entity6 ghosted into space in the box and was unmarked as a parried ball from @entity83 fell at his feet			1
he made sure his shot found the back of the net as he rifled home from six yards out			0
@entity2 had a chance to strike back five minutes later but , having found himself one - one - one with the goalkeeper and with two of his team - mates to the left of him , @entity72 blasted the ball over the keeper and over the goal			1
another mistake from @entity58 almost gifted the @entity26 a second goal but instead of running into the space he had available , @entity69 decided to shoot from outside the box and could not keep his effort on target .			0

@entity6 's second - half goal wins the game for @entity0
@entity72 missed a one - on - one chance to *equalise* for @entity2
@entity2 now sit outside the play - off places after a *damaging* defeat
