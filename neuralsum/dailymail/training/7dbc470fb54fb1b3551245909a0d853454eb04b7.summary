by @entity0 cure for the meds : quit sugar to avoid gaining weight when you are put on steroids i am on long - term corticosteroids to treat a rheumatic condition which means i have very stiff joints – especially my shoulders , upper arms and hips			1
one of the side effects is that i have gained weight which i find impossible to shift			1
is it pointless trying to diet and exercise if the drugs are making me bigger ? no. many people experience weight gain when they start taking steroids , as one of the side effects is an increased appetite			1
but this means it is also possible to control			1
this is actually a great opportunity to clean up your diet			1
it ’s high calorie and the latest research suggests it triggers weight gain by affecting our body chemistry , too			1
of course sugar is a natural component of whole foods , but this is n’t the problem			1
do you drink fizzy pop ? how about a teaspoon in tea or coffee ? alcohol is high calorie and often laden with sugar – there are online calculators that will tell you how many extra calories your daily tipple adds			1
even modest regular drinkers are usually in for a shock			1
check the ingredients of any pre-prepared foods , as there ’s hidden sugar in many supermarket products			1
also be wary of honey and other sweet syrups - these are basically pure sugar and empty calories			1
fruit juices and smoothies are high in sugar albeit natural			1
i quit @entity69 , by @entity70 , is a great new book about all the health benefits – including weight loss – of a sugar - free diet			1
all weight loss is achieved by limiting calories consumed and maximising what you ’re burning off , so exercise is also key			1
even committing to walking for 30 minutes a day will be a start			1
but if you really want to burn some calories , then you ca n’t beat @entity82 ( @entity82 )			1
search on @entity83 for hundreds of these short , intense workouts			1
often , an entire workout can take just ten minutes			1
good luck ! i ’ve read that even skinny children can be storing up health problems if they do n’t exercise			1
that ’s my teenage grandson ! he spends his spare time playing computer games			1
what can we do to get him out of his bedroom ? when we were that age , we played outdoors and i ’ve never had to diet or worry about things like the gym			1
i ’m 83 , and still wear clothes i bought in my 30s			1
turn it off : even a slim person needs to turn the computer off and get up and exercise for their health you ’re right , staying fit well into old age is n’t just about size			1
a recent study looked at how inactivity in childhood led to fat deposits accumulating around the organs – hence the acronym @entity117 : thin outside , @entity118			2
establishing regular exercise early in life lowers the risk of most degenerative diseases , including diabetes , heart disease and some forms of cancer			2
in @entity128 , sport is ingrained in the culture			2
it ’s a shame sports are n’t so popular among @entity133 teens			2
as your grandson loves his computer , a @entity136 with physically active games , could be a good investment			2
before i came to @entity128 , people warned me about ‘ the @entity142 stone ’ – referring to the weight gain many experience when they move to the city			1
eating out , larger portions and food that ’s more heavily processed are the main culprits			2
luckily , discovering the city ’s vibrant workout culture first meant i did n’t fall prey to it			2
i have noticed changes in my digestion , though , and developed some food intolerances since my move			2
here ’s a luxurious way to beat the heat : a cooling spray containing none of the additives or chemical nasties that shop - bought brands can contain			2
empty atomiser spray bottles can be purchased cheaply online or at department stores , so you can have one by the bed and one for your bag or desk drawer			2
this is not to be used as a sun block , but the anti-inflammatory properties of aloe vera mean that it ’s a great treatment for sunburn			2
witch - hazel soothes the skin and helps reduce swelling			2
eucalyptus oil gives a fresh aroma and has a cooling sensation , as does peppermint oil , which can also be used as an alternative , or addition			2
essential oils may not be suitable for pregnant women or those with some medical conditions – consult your doctor before using this spray			0
@entity196 - 50ml water - 25ml aloe vera juice			0
look for a brand containing nothing but aloe inner gel such as the one by @entity200 ( £ 8.96 , 500ml , pukkaherbs.com )			0
it ’s 99.8 per cent pure with just some lemon juice as a preservative			0
you can find 100 per cent pure on the internet			0
these are usually marketed as drinks but are perfect for putting on skin too			0
- 25ml distilled witch - hazel liquid - 5 drops of eucalyptus and / or peppermint essential oil , or three drops of each @entity215 ingredients into a bowl and decant into an atomiser spray bottle			0
shake well before use and spritz your face and body when hot			1
can be stored in the fridge for two to three months			0
tackling these problems means i now follow a mainly vegan diet – i eat no dairy at all , but occasionally fish or eggs			0
food blogger @entity229 , pictured , has a similar story			0
after moving from @entity233 to the @entity234 , her @entity128 diet left her feeling lethargic and lumpen , and she , too , started eating vegan – not because of animal rights , but for her health			0
and if this instantly conjures up images of endless plates of tasteless mung beans , then her new recipe book , @entity244 , should change your mind			1
i love the sound of dishes like @entity249 and @entity250 , and you do n’t need eggs or cream to make her desserts			0
if that was n’t enough to tempt you , the well - publicised health benefits of a vegan diet ( as spelled out in the @entity128 cult documentary @entity259 ) include everything from lowered blood pressure to reduced risk of heart disease , diabetes and other diseases			0
a lessening in the environmental impact of factory farming and the needless suffering of animals is just an added bonus			0
in the past year , the @entity274 has been photographed playing volleyball , cricket , the @entity278 game of three tins at the @entity280 ( above ) , running along a sandy beach and doing hurdles – all while wearing vertiginous heels			0
and now it seems as if princess @entity285 is getting in on the act			0
she was last week photographed posing with a hockey stick wearing @entity274 ’s heel of choice : wedges			0
what is it with the @entity293 and wedges ? perhaps the girls are following in the heels of the fictional @entity297 – from @entity298 – who was forever sprinting down the streets of @entity142 in @entity301			1
but they should be careful			0
despite ‘ high - heel workouts ’ growing in popularity , it seems more than a little dangerous to me			0
i ’ve had too many sprained ankles from just walking in high heels , let alone taking to the treadmill in them			0
@entity128 are obsessed with their teeth , and it seems as if everybody here has a perfect movie - star smile			0
flossing is a favourite national pastime , while most wear braces as children and then have their teeth bleached white			0
it ’s no wonder , then , that the ancient @entity321 practice of oil pulling is the latest health craze			0
said to remove harmful bacteria and plaque build - up , as well as whiten teeth naturally , oil pulling involves swishing a tablespoonful of oil around in your mouth for ten to 15 minutes each morning – before eating , drinking or brushing your teeth – then spitting it out			0
i ’ve been trying it , and it ’s not as disgusting as it sounds			0
i use coconut oil as i like the taste , and swish it about as i make breakfast			0
