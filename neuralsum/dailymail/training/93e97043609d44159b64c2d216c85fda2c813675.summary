the ageing process of a woman from infancy to old age is captured beautifully in this timelapse illustration by @entity6 artist and illustrator @entity5			1
mr @entity5 , who is better known as @entity8 , has meticulously rendered each of life ’s stages in layers , so that a baby swiftly transforms into a growing girl who , in her turn becomes a young lady before the inevitable happens and an ageing woman emerges from the skilful brush of the artist			1
the four - minute video captures the poignancy of ageing wonderfully as the artist affects minute changes which thoroughly alter the painting , although the features of the ' subject ' remain the same throughout			2
remarkable work of art : @entity6 artist @entity5 adds minute changes to each layer so that an entirely new picture emerges in the end step - by - step details in short , swift strokes are added to the painting , which becomes more and more lifelike as it ‘ ages ’			1
the face becomes longer , losing its baby fat chubbiness and hair goes through various colour and length changes			2
mr @entity5 manipulates his digital brush skilfully , adding minute changes upon each layer and building a picture of a woman who has left her youth behind and is going towards old age			1
as the painting becomes ‘ older ’ , the subject too takes on mature gaze			0
ageing gracefully : wrinkles etch the face as the subject loses its flush of youth and heads towards maturity coming full circle : the artist skillfully demonstrates the poignancy of growing older in the four - minute video the artist adds more wrinkles to the picture and an older lady emerges			2
hair is now nearly snow - white and the wrinkles have deepened even more and are no longer just constrained to the corners of the mouth and eyes			0
skin has lost its elasticity , and sags down			0
signs of ageing are most obvious in the neck area , a truly lifelike representation of old age			0
this level of precise detailing is carried through to the clasped hands , with gnarled and bony knuckles .			0

@entity8 transforms a baby to an old woman in minutes
details are meticulously added as a whole new picture emerges
digital transformation captures every single *nuance* of ageing
