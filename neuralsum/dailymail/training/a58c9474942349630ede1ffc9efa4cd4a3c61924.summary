by @entity0 published : 17:04 est , 16 november 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 16 november 2013 like most men who have turned 40 – and many who are much younger – i endlessly and pointlessly worry about my health			1
a hangover can easily become terminal hepatitis c after a few misguided clicks on net doctor			1
recently my partner @entity9 – fed up with my constant worrying – told me she was getting one of those all - singing , all - dancing private health mots via her work ’s healthcare plan , and ordered me to do the same			1
i was intrigued , as any middle - aged hypochondriac would be			1
had my misspent youth left irreparable damage ? clean @entity18 : @entity0 has his fitness tested at the gym as part of a health @entity23 courtesy of his gp but with no health insurance of my own , the day of tests would cost me a hefty £ 650			1
surely , there are other options ? after a little research i discovered i could get almost everything offered by the private @entity23 companies for free or next to nothing with an @entity34 at the gp and a fitness test at my gym			1
dr @entity37 , a gp in @entity38 , says : ‘ we offer a series of basic tests to assess the risks of heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes and kidney disease			1
’ the service , he explains , is available to adults aged between 40 and 74			1
there are not as many tests as in the more complex private screening ; an @entity50 for example			1
dr @entity37 adds : ‘ the @entity34 is more discerning			2
if there is a need for further testing – whether through family history or lifestyle – then it can be done			2
’ and so i submitted myself			2
the good news : i ’d save a lot of money			2
the bad news : i might find out i ’m really dying			2
@entity62 i have a pin - prick blood test where a tiny sample taken from a finger is put on a cartridge , then inserted into a machine			1
in a few seconds a number pops up on the digital display			2
‘ high cholesterol can contribute to blocked arteries , ’ says dr @entity37			1
these are associated with heart attack and stroke			2
the @entity34 recommends total cholesterol should be scored lower than five			1
result : action required my cholesterol test gives me a slightly raised level of 5.53			1
i ’m confused as @entity9 is vegetarian and i ’m hardly overweight at 6ft 3in with a size 34 waist			2
but we eat far too much cheese and lashings of butter			2
it ’s no disaster – i ’ve no family history of heart problems			2
i ’m advised to cut down on dairy and sugar and come back in a month			2
@entity23 : the @entity34 check , available to adults between 40 and 74 , tests everything from cholesterol to kidney health kidney health @entity97 , a urine test : i ’m given a little screw - top jar , pop to the loo , return , and the nurse dips in a stick which changes colour as the chemicals react with protein in the sample			1
‘ high protein in the urine can be associated with kidney disease , ’ says dr @entity37			1
this problem is increasingly prevalent , due to high blood sugar and blood pressure			2
result : no action required i hand over a sample which looks suspiciously cloudy – only to find the testing strip turns yellow , i ’m ‘ completely normal ’			0
@entity120 would have been bad news			0
@entity122 the test for blood pressure is familiar – an inflatable cuff is strapped round my upper arm and inflated until it ’s tight , then air is slowly let out			0
high blood pressure increases the risk of serious vascular health problems such as heart attack , stroke and kidney disease			1
it often has no symptoms			0
result : no action required there are two numbers : systolic , the highest level your blood pressure reaches when your heart beats ; and diastolic , the lowest level your blood pressure reaches as your heart relaxes between beats			0
it should be between 90/60 and 140/90 and at 107/60 , i am ‘ excellent ’			0
this feels like a walk in the park			0
result : @entity0 's @entity154 check - up came back mostly positive , putting an end to months of concern about his health @entity158 ( @entity158 ) your @entity158 is an indicator of how healthy your weight is			1
a higher reading will indicate obesity , which raises risks of everything from diabetes to cancers			0
it is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared			0
result : action may be required at 91kg and with a @entity158 of 25.2 , i ’m just overweight			0
this comes as a shock as i rarely eat breakfast , busily attending to the needs of my three - year - old , @entity176			1
‘ breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day , ’ says my gp			0
‘ without it , your body goes into lockdown and actually stores energy as fat			0
’ @entity186 ‘ this indicates diabetes risk more than @entity158 alone , ’ says dr @entity37			0
‘ measure around your belly button , not where your trousers sit , and do n’t suck in			0
’ men should measure less than 37in and women 31.5in			0
result : no action required at 34in , i ’m bang in the middle of the safe area			0
since the test , i ’ve lost 2kg , putting my @entity158 back in the healthy bracket , through cutting down on dairy products , eating breakfast , light cycling , gym trips and generally thinking about what i eat			0
overall improvement : @entity0 urges other men over 40 to get a health mot from their doctor , insisting it has improved his sex life and made him happier @entity213 ‘ we do n’t take just one risk factor for cardiovascular disease , ’ says dr @entity37			1
‘ we combine different elements , such as age , sex , blood pressure , smoking and cholesterol			1
result : good – but action required i have less than a ten per cent chance of developing heart disease over the next ten years			0
but i smoke – a couple a day			0
‘ your result is good but would be even better if you gave up smoking , ’ says dr @entity37			0
conclusion like many men , i ’ve been sitting around worrying about my health but not doing anything about it for too long			1
i ’m sleeping better , feel happier and my sex life has improved			0
there are other things i could have had , such as diabetes screening and a liver function test , but i am assured that due to my history and lack of health problems , it was unnecessary			1
older men can have prostate cancer screening , and after 60 we all get a bowel cancer screening test			0
for free ! and we all love a bargain , so why not do it ? ‘ for the most part our bodies are incredibly resilient , ’ says dr @entity37			1
‘ by checking our health , we generally do n’t discover we ’re going to die imminently , but we can make changes for the better to improve our health and the chance of living a better life for longer			1
’ for my part , i would urge other men to get checked out			0
if i can do it , anybody can .			0
