@entity10 , a married mother , has undergone 17 operations since the april 2013 blast and was in *excruciating* pain
earlier this month she had her left leg removed from below the knee
before the amputation , she penned a break up *letter* to her limb and threw it a ' last supper ' with family and friends
she will now start physical therapy and eventually get a prosthetic
