' @entity30 is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the @entity37			1
symptoms , including pain , tingling and numbness , begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs			1
it can also cause muscle weakness , co-ordination problems , paralysis and even death			0
the exact cause is not known , but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection			0
it attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system , including the motor nerves , used by the brain to control muscles			2
around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome			0
within two days of noticing the first symptoms , which included a numbing sensation in the arms and legs , miss @entity6 was admitted to @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity51			1
but doctors were baffled by her symptoms and it was not until she was given a lumbar puncture - an injection in the base of her spine - that things become clear			2
' when they did the injection , i was warned it would be painful but i could n't feel a thing			0
i think everyone knew there and then that something bad was going on , ' she said			0
three days after @entity118 returned from @entity10 she was diagnosed with @entity30			1
guillain - barre syndrome simulates a nerve cell , causing the body to attack its own nervous system as it fights the infection and can cause paralysis and even death			1

but i was n't too worried			0
doctors told me it was a mild case and i 'd be home in three days			2
' unfortunately for the 29 - year - old , her condition began to deteriorate			1
she added : ' it was weird			0
i felt fine , but my body just was n't working			1
' then my friend came to visit me and she asked me what was wrong with my face			0
i looked in the mirror and when i tried to smile , my mouth just would n't move			2
i suddenly realised how serious it all was			0
' that night miss @entity6 was transferred to the high dependency unit			1
she said : ' it was scary because everyone else there was full of tubes and wires but i did n't feel ill at all			0
' but again , miss @entity6 began to deteriorate and after loosing her ability to speak or swallow , was transferred to intensive care			1
' when they moved me to intensive care , i was warned that i might not be able to breathe for myself , and i 'd need a tube fitted to feed me			0
' they even mentioned the possibility that i could die			0
a week before i 'd been having the time of my life ' ' they even mentioned the possibility that i could die			0
i just could n't believe it - a week before i 'd been having the time of my life in @entity10			1
' but miraculously , after ten days in intensive care , miss @entity6 responded to treatment and her condition stabilised			1
a month later , she was allowed to move to @entity28 , to be nearer her family			2
miss @entity6 said : ' back in @entity28 i really started to feel better and was told i could start rehabilitation			1
i was warned recovery would be a long and slow process but by this point i could eat and speak again , so i was starting to feel like myself again			2
' miss @entity6 spent five gruelling months of physiotherapy at the @entity171 in @entity28 , where she had to learn to walk again			1
' it was a tough time but every little thing was a big achievement			0
i 'd get so happy if i could just wiggle my toes or hold a pen			0
inspiration : the air hostess is a @entity179 volunteer and hopes her story inspires others ' it was hard being in rehab , but the staff were amazing			0
they encouraged me to do normal things and did stuff like paint my nails for me			0
' i could n't have got through everything without the support of my friends , family and boyfriend ' ' they even helped me get dressed for a date and let my friends come in to do my hair and tan - it 's thanks to them i 'm now with my amazing boyfriend @entity200			2
' miss @entity6 finally returned home and has since been going from strength to strength			1
she said ' leaving rehab was surreal , but it was amazing - it feels like i finally have my life back			2
' she has even started modelling for @entity207 , an agency that campaigns for diversity in models			0
' i was browsing the internet for some customized crutches on a site called @entity212 , and on their website i came across @entity207			0
' i got in touch straight away , and i 've just had some test shots done - i ca n't believe it			2
' i just want people to know that just because someone is disabled , or in a wheelchair or on crutches , it does n't mean they 're not like everybody else			0
' i could n't have got through everything without the support of my friends , family and boyfriend , but i hope my story will inspire people , and change how disability is thought of			0
