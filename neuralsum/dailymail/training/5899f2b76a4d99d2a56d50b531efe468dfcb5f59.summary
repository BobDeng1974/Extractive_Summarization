click here to read @entity2 's in - depth report on fixing in cricket			1
@entity4 has been banned from cricket for life after releasing a remarkable video statement which begins with the words : ‘ my name is @entity4 and i am a cheat			1
’ the former @entity12 star , whose involvement in match - fixing was laid bare by @entity15 in may , pleaded guilty to 18 breaches of the @entity18 ’s anti-corruption regulations , relating to three county matches			1
he also confessed to seven charges pertaining to the 2012 @entity21 in @entity22			1
@entity4 said : ‘ i have abused my position as a professional sportsman on a number of occasions by choosing to accept money in fixing			1
‘ it ’s a truth that has rightly caused uproar and controversy in @entity12 and around the world			1
i have shamed my country , i have shamed my sport , i have shamed those close to me			1
and for that , i am not proud			1
’ his four - and - a - half - minute statement was posted on the 3news.co.nz website a few hours before the @entity18 announced his ban , which will apply worldwide			1
it follows the life ban handed down to @entity52 seamer @entity51 , who conspired with @entity4 to fix @entity54 ’s 40 - over game against @entity55 at @entity56 in august 2011			1
the 18 charges laid at @entity4 ’s door relate to that match plus two @entity21 fixtures he played — for @entity61 against @entity62 in 2008 and for @entity54 against @entity61 three years later			1
six weeks ago , former @entity64 and @entity61 batsman @entity63 told @entity15 how @entity4 offered him £ 10,000 to score fewer than 10 runs in the game against @entity62			1
@entity4 doubled the offer the next day			1
@entity18 chief executive @entity68 said : ‘ we are extremely pleased that the matter has now been brought to a satisfactory conclusion and that an individual who repeatedly sought to involve others in corrupt activity for his own personal gain has accepted that his conduct warrants a lifetime ban from cricket			1
’ @entity4 , 35 , who played 23 tests and 102 one - day internationals between 2001 and 2007 , said he had been persuaded to come clean after meeting his future wife @entity81 and learning about ‘ unconditional love ’			1
he said : ‘ i can finally look my children in the eyes and tell them that honesty is the best policy — even if it feels like the hardest thing to do at times			2
i now believe in myself as a person again and i do n’t wake up every morning hating myself			2
‘ today is the day i offer my deepest , deepest apologies to the public and the cricketing world , to the loyal fans , to the dedicated coaches , staff , players past and present			2
’ he refused to blame the depression he suffers for his misdeeds , adding : ‘ my actions i will regret for the rest of my life			2
’ video match - fix cheat @entity4 banned for life you 'd never guess : @entity4 - here batting for @entity61 against @entity106 in 2008 - was at it for years that was echoed by @entity110 chief executive @entity109 , who said : ‘ i encourage all the players to note how engagement in this type of activity can destroy careers and lives			1
’ @entity64 all - rounder @entity117 also applauded @entity4 ’s life ban			1
‘ that would scare a lot of people out of it , i ’d hope , ’ he said			2
‘ for a lot of people who play cricket , cricket is everything to them			2
you finish your career at 35			2
if you get a life ban from cricket then what on earth are you going to do with your life ? ’ four cricketers have been imprisoned in @entity64 for the involvement in corruption : the @entity52 trio @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , plus @entity143 seamer @entity142			2
but the possibility of criminal proceedings against @entity4 would depend on whether the @entity146 considered a trial to be a sensible use of public funds			1
my name is @entity4 and i am a cheat i have abused my position as a professional sportsman on a number of occasions by choosing to accept money in fixing			1
i have lived with this dark secret for so many years , but months ago i reached the point where i decided i had to come forward and tell the truth			1
it 's a truth that has rightly caused uproar and controversy in @entity12 and around the world			1
i have shamed my country , i have shamed my sport , i have shamed those close to me			2
and for that , i am not proud			2
i lost faith in myself , in the game , i abused the game i loved			2
i had to put things right			0
speaking out , exposing the truth , laying bare the things i have done wrong , is the only way i could find to begin to put things right			0
the time has come for me now to face them like a man and accept the consequences – whatever they may be			0
i could not live with my wrongdoings any longer and after meeting my future wife @entity81 , after learning what unconditional love really is , i felt strong enough to tell her what i 'd done and she has helped me take the painful steps in telling my parents , my wider family and then the authorities			1
i am proud of the ones i love , especially my immediate family and friends			0
their strength , support and forgiveness has enabled me to address some of the deepest , most uncomfortable issues one can face			0
i can finally look my children in the eyes and tell them that honesty is the best policy – even if it feels like the hardest thing to do at times			0
i now believe in myself as a person again and i do n't wake up every morning hating myself			0
today is the day i offer my deepest , deepest apologies to the public and the cricketing world , to the loyal fans , to the dedicated coaches , staff , players past and present			0
i apologise to and thank the @entity212 for the help and support that is out there for all players , that has helped me a great deal , @entity218 and his legal team and all the associations that have handled the sensitive situation with professionalism and respect			0
the people who know me know i 'm vulnerable , but they also know that i am not stupid			0
and i know what is right and what is wrong			0
i do suffer from depression – that is absolutely no excuse for all i 've done wrong			0
i used to think mistakes were made by bad people , but now i even know that good people can make the worst of mistakes			0
my actions i will regret for the rest of my life			0
for sport to prosper , it is up to players to police the game , because they are the ones that will ultimately lose out and allow themselves to be used as pawns to make money			0
no one should ever be put in a position and no one should ever allow themselves to forget what sport is about and let money rule their decisions			0
the decisions i made were wrong			0
players must be better than that ; above reproach , for the fans , for the sport			0
for the first time in a very long time i feel positive about my future , i am finally becoming the man i want to be			0
i have to face up to my wrongs and make them right			0
i have kept my head down for too long now and it 's time to man up to my mistakes and today , i can stand with a better conscience because i know i am doing the right thing			0
it is entirely my fault and i 'll never be able to stand in front of a game again , it 's entirely my fault that i will not be able to apply my skills in a positive way to help future cricketers , but it is entirely possible that i can use this moment to convince others not to be tempted by wrongdoing			0
to do the right thing for themselves , for family and friends and for the sport they love.i accept my punishment .			0
