by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor guarantee : @entity4 education secretary @entity3 says @entity5 will help parents get back into work primary schools will have to offer childcare from 8am to 6pm under @entity5 plans to help working families			1
the guarantee that children can be looked after outside traditional school hours is designed to help parents who struggle to fit jobs in with ferrying their children around			1

there will also be a promise to strengthen the minimum wage , reverse benefits changes dubbed the ‘ bedroom tax ’ and action to reduce energy bills			0
under the ‘ @entity40 ’ parents will still have to pay for the childcare through state - funded vouchers or their own money			1
but by ensuring schools remain open and willing to look after children from 8am to 6pm , parents can commit to working longer hours			2
in his speech to the @entity5 conference tomorrow , mr @entity3 will say : ‘ for school - age children , childcare has become a logistical nightmare			1
‘ @entity53 scrapped @entity5 ’s programme to support before and after - school clubs , leaving many parents struggling to juggle work and family life			1
‘ if we want an economy that works for working people , we must support parents trying to balance these pressures			0
’ the @entity40 will be written into law if @entity5 wins the 2015 election , mr @entity3 will announce			1
conference : labour leader @entity68 ( left in @entity31 today ) and deputy leader @entity69 ( right ) are at pains to prove they have election - fighting policies at the annual conference , which begins tomorrow ‘ this will give all parents of primary school children the certainty that they can access childcare from 8am - 6pm through their school			1
a clear message to hard working parents : @entity5 is on your side			1
’ but in a blow to mr @entity68 's claim to be helping people feeling the pinch , a new poll shows most people still blame @entity5			2
the @entity91 survey found 30 per cent said @entity5 was to to blame for the fall in living standards over the last few years , compared with 16 per cent who blame the @entity95 alone and 9 per cent who blame the coalition			2
@entity98 : @entity68 's wife @entity101 ( in red coat , below right ) spoke in @entity31 ahead of the @entity5 annual conference all parties together are blamed by 19 per cent while just one per cent said it was the fault of the @entity105			2
tackling the costs and difficulties of bringing up children have become a major political battleground			0
parenting costs : labour leader @entity68 and his wife @entity101 took the chance to take their children @entity115 ( right ) and @entity116 ( left ) for a walk along @entity31 beach today @entity105 leader @entity119 this week announced that all children in reception , year one and year two will receive free school meals			0
he argued the policy aimed at children aged seven and under will reduce costs for parents while increasing attainment			2
conservative childcare minister @entity131 has also pushed for reform of rules for nurseries and childminders to cut costs			0
@entity5 points to figures showing two thirds of parents of need some form of before - and - after school or holiday care to combine family and work			1
but almost a third of these were unable to find it			0
meanwhile , @entity5 ’s deputy leader @entity69 is pushing for the party to promise to introduce ‘ granny leave ’ in its 2015 manifesto			1
it would allow grandparents to help out with looking after grandchildren without giving up work altogether			1
under the plan mothers and fathers would be able to transfer part of their flexible parental leave to grandparents			0
ms @entity69 said many grandmothers in particular are forced to decide between their own jobs and helping their daughter or daughter - in - law to return to work			1
she told @entity165 : ‘ they should n’t have to make that choice			0
i am going to fight for it to be in the manifesto			0
‘ i am determined that it should be			0
i am going to make sure that we have a big offer on childcare			0
it is such a central issue for our women			0
reform : both @entity119 , left , and @entity131 , right , have pushed for changes to childcare laws ‘ it is down to @entity5 to listen to women and respond			2
our manifesto is going to understand what is going on in people ’s lives and put forward solutions that help			0
’ a recent study by the @entity189 think tank found grandmothers who look after their grandchildren are likely to be low paid , younger and in work			0
two - thirds of grandmothers who provide between 10 and 19 hours of child care a week earn less than £ 25,999 a year , compared to a quarter who earn £ 44,000 or more .			0

@entity5 would *legislate* to force primary schools to guarantee childcare
parents would still have to pick up the bill for costs or use vouchers
@entity3 to argue parents struggle to juggle work and family life
@entity69 calls for ' granny leave ' to allow grandparents to take time off to look after grandchildren
