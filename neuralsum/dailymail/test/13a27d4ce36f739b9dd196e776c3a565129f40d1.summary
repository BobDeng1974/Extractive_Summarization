for talented youth team strikers fighting for their big break in the game , goals really are the best currency to convert into those precious first - team minutes			0
and after extraordinary seasons in which they have both smashed the 35 - goal mark , @entity12 's teenage strike duo @entity11 and @entity13 are certainly flush at the moment			1
the two 17 - year - olds are in the form of their young lives , enhancing their reputations every time they find the net and boosting their chances of @entity22 handing them some game time once the @entity25 title has been secured			1
@entity11 scores for @entity12 during their 3 - 1 @entity28 final first leg win against @entity29 striker @entity13 celebrates after scoring @entity12 's third goal at the @entity31 on monday and after the @entity35 manager said his first - team squad had space for ' three or four kids ' next season , there is every incentive to keep scoring			1
the latest victim of their remarkable goalscoring spree was @entity29 in the first leg of the @entity28 final on monday night			1
@entity12 will take a commanding 3 - 1 lead into the second leg at @entity48 after @entity53 's double - which took his tally to 36 for the season - was added to late on by @entity13 , who has now reached 35			1
the @entity54 have consciously tried to recruit talented young players from the @entity57 area and @entity58 - born @entity53 , who joined the club in the under eights , is a success story of this policy			0
by any standards , he has enjoyed an exceptional season and one that has featured numerous milestones in his development			2
most striking has been the sheer volume of goals for the under 18 team , who finished 10 points clear at the top of the southern section of the @entity25 at that age group , and are currently competing in the play - off round			0
@entity53 is top scorer in the whole competition with 22 goals			0
@entity13 ( no 9 ) celebrates with @entity53 after the latter 's second goal of the night and 36th this season @entity13 , pictured scoring against @entity29 , could play for the first - team against @entity83 this weekend highlights included back - to - back hat - tricks in away matches with @entity87 ( which ended in 4 - 2 and 6 - 4 wins ) , plus four goals during @entity12 's run to success in the @entity92 , the continental competition for under 19 teams			1
this campaign has also seen a scoring debut for @entity12 's under 21 side and a first involvement with the @entity100 youth set - up			2
it has been the kind of scoring sequence where pretty much anything struck seems to fly into the top corner and that was the case for @entity53 's first goal against @entity29			2
controlling @entity108 's excellent ball over the top to allow it to run across his body , he sent his shot spearing into the top corner			0
it was a moment that drew considerable attention on @entity116			0
little wonder the dreadlocked frontman described ' scoring goals as the best feeling ever ' in an interview after the match			0
his second goal showed the sort of instinct all successful strikers need , positioning himself on the edge of @entity29 's six - yard box to hook the ball home after the goalkeeper had blocked an initial header from @entity133			2
@entity53 ( right ) poses with team - mates @entity134 and @entity133 ( @entity136 ) after winning the @entity92 @entity13 trains regularly with @entity12 's first - team and made his senior debut against @entity139 this season another strength is his ability to play across the forward line , on either flank or as a central targetman			1
on monday , he started on the right , with @entity146 as the no 9 and @entity133 on the other side			0
when asked about it , @entity53 showed a studious nature when it comes to watching the game : ' over the years you see how people have to change their positions in games and it 's a good thing if you can adapt			0
' @entity13 is a more familiar name to not only followers of @entity12 but football fans in general			1
he has been part of @entity22 's first - team squad all season alongside @entity133 , 18 , and the midfielder @entity165 , 19			0
they train daily with the first team and @entity13 made his professional debut when he replaced @entity169 for the final 20 minutes of a @entity171 match with @entity139 back in october			1
he seems well - suited to the continental stage , as shown by the tournament - best 12 goals he scored as @entity12 became the first @entity176 side to lift the @entity92 after beating @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 last week			2
@entity13 scored in every round in that competition and has now done likewise in the @entity28 , a competition he won when @entity12 beat @entity183 in last season 's final			1
@entity53 acrobatically puts @entity12 2 - 1 ahead against @entity29 after @entity187 's equaliser @entity13 scores @entity12 's second goal in their 3 - 2 win over @entity177 in the @entity92 final by his standards , it was a quiet night against @entity29 but when his chance came in the closing minutes , he made no mistake and scored a potentially tie - killing third			1
with @entity198 out injured and @entity199 and @entity200 doubtful , there is a chance @entity13 will play against @entity83 in the @entity25 this weekend			1
his performances this season , which has also seen him elevated to @entity100 under 18 standard , mean he is no longer an unknown quantity but any first - team action between now and the close of the campaign will be valuable			0
@entity13 is calm about his future but certainly not complacent			2
he said after the @entity92 success : ' it 's a tough task at @entity12 to get into the first team but you 've just got to keep working and see what happens			2
' you 've got to keep trying to improve and impress and who knows what happens in the future			0
' like @entity53 , he is certainly making a compelling case at the moment .			0

@entity11 scored twice against @entity29 on monday
@entity13 was also on target in the @entity28 final first leg
the @entity12 duo have been in *brilliant* form so far this season
both will be *hoping* to earn some playing time if @entity12 *clinch* the title
@entity13 could be involved against @entity83 at the @entity234 on *sunday*
