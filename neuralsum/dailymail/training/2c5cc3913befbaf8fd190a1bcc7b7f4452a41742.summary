for many couples , space from one another is a vital part of a healthy relationship			0
but for one couple who live in the @entity7 in @entity9 space is simply not an option because their tiny apartment measures just 242 square foot			1
despite this , @entity14 and her boyfriend @entity15 have become used to moving the couch out of the way before they can go to bed every night			1
and when they decide to go to sleep , they have to move the couch before they can pull the bed down , which has a duvet and pillow on it already made up			1
the cramped property also features a little bathroom with a door made from reclaimed wood on barn door sliders			0
meanwhile , the kitchen , which takes up most of the leftover space , features an oven , a ' big ' mini fridge , pots and pans hanging from the ceiling and a wooden table where they put a bowl of fruit			0
the limited space means that the couple have to plan their meals very carefully			2
' we really only shop for one or two meals at a time , no @entity78 trips in this house ! ' @entity15 told @entity80			0
in the space that 's left , they have a minuscule walk - in closet and a tiny attic above the bath			1
' so we 're renting that [ attic ] now on @entity88 for $ 275 - a - week , if anyone 's interested ! ' @entity15 joked			1
kitchen : the kitchen appears to take up most of the space in the apartment and features an oven , big mini fridge , pots and pans hanging from the ceiling and a wooden table where they put a bowl of fruit reclaimed wood : the bathroom door is made from reclaimed wood on barn door sliders , pictured above , walk in closet : @entity14 stands in her small walk in closet , pictured in the back , the original wooden dining room table is another space - saving design that takes up only three inches in the wall and has been made to look like a cupboard			0
but it provides the couple with two benches and a wooden table when it 's pulled down for use			1
' it just has so much character , ' @entity15 said			0
' then you squeeze , ' he adds , as he moves to the back of the table to sit down			0
dining table : the original wooden dining table takes up three inches in the wall and has been made to look like a cupboard , seen here , ' it just has so much character , ' @entity15 said			0
' then you squeeze , ' he adds , as he moves to the back of the table to sit down marriage : the couple plan to get married on @entity135 after living in very close proximity to each other the bathroom and kitchen were redone as a part of a $ 33,000 renovation on the apartment which they bought three years ago for $ 270,000			1
in previous years , the apartment used to be used as a dorm for @entity146 dock workers			2
however , their small living unit is not the city 's smallest pad			1
a studio in @entity153 's @entity152 is just 90 square foot and measures 12 feet by 7 feet			1
it is being rented by @entity156 who pays just over $ 700 per month for her microstudio in an area where the average rent for an apartment is $ 3,600 per month			2
and while living in such close proximity could have spelled disaster for this couple 's relationship , it appears to have worked out well for them as they plan to get married in the @entity168			2
@entity14 said : ' we plan to get married on @entity135			0
i do n't know about long term plans , but our dream is to be able to keep this [ apartment ] as a pied - a - terre			0

the tiny apartment located in @entity9 is only 242 square foot
it is not the city 's smallest pad but ranks as one of the most humble
when the couple go to bed they have to move the couch first
they spent $ 33,000 renovating it and bought it three years ago for $ 270,000
