@entity0 tossed his jacket aside in this match and he ’s now going to have to roll up his sleeves			1
that ’s two games and two defeats for his promoted @entity8 side			1
granted , one was against @entity9 and this was away from home against a side who won at @entity14 on the opening day			1
but already , at this extremely early stage , the @entity16 looks like he needs a few more creative thinkers on the pitch			2
time and again @entity8 held possession — 45 per cent , which is good going in these parts — but lacked the wit to find a way through a backline that performed well , yet still appears the weak point of this side			1
celebration : @entity30 goalscorer @entity29 and his team - mates look delighted after he scores in the 23rd minute against @entity8 goalscorer : @entity8 goalkeeper @entity33 was unable to keep @entity29 's shot out of the net despite his best efforts team effort : @entity30 , pictured celebrating @entity29 's goal , proved to be too strong for @entity40 newcomers @entity8 @entity30 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity41 6.5 ; @entity42 6 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 6.5 , @entity45 5.5 ; @entity46 6 , @entity47 5 ; @entity29 7.5 ( @entity48 65 , 6 ) , @entity49 6.5 , @entity50 7 ( @entity51 90 ) ; @entity52 6.5 ( @entity53 64 )			1
subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58			2
booked : @entity47 , @entity49 manager : @entity60 7 @entity8 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity33 6 ; @entity61 5 , @entity62 6.5 , @entity63 5 , @entity64 4.5 ; @entity65 5.5 , @entity66 6 ( @entity67 90 ) , @entity68 5.5 , @entity45 6 ( @entity69 70 , 6 ) ; @entity70 5.5 ( @entity71 81 ) , @entity72 6.5 subs not used : @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77			1
booked : @entity63 manager : @entity0 5.5 referee : @entity80 6.5 att : 20,565 @entity81 : @entity29 unfortunately for @entity0 , it was his own defence that buckled , making @entity8 ’s lack of penetration up front all the more telling			1
@entity29 ’s goal was avoidable , the ‘ outstanding negative ’ in @entity0 ’s words after @entity86 made a hash of an interception and @entity63 hesitated in closing @entity29 down			1
‘ i was just explaining to them that we showed too much respect in the first half , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ that can happen to promoted teams			2
i have been through it myself			0
‘ we are not naive enough to think the growth period does n’t have to be quick because it does			0
’ the last point was telling			0
indeed , they learnt something of a lesson in the break , re-emerging with far more purpose and disregard for what was coming at them			0
they were at least the equal of @entity30 in the second half			1
but the test will come from creating proper chances and taking them , which is what @entity8 failed to do here			1
had they shown similar precision to @entity30 , they might have taken a point , a reward more tangible than the ‘ encouraging ’ signs to which @entity0 pointed			1
‘ @entity30 are good but they are not @entity9 yet , ’ he added			1
‘ they are a very good side			2
but it was a more realistic challenge			0
we did n’t get anything and that is the challenge			0
but at least the players will know they can compete at this level			0
’ for @entity60 , this was a second win in two , increasing the sense that he is the right man to lead the club			2
he spoke this week of banishing mobile phones from @entity30 ’s canteen and kicking out agents two days before a game			1
the measures were aimed at fostering a more united squad than that of last season			0
already , he has been able to point to a performance of more grit than usual			0
@entity60 said : ‘ in the first half we controlled the game			0
we spoke at half - time that they would throw everything at us and we were n’t at our fluent best , but we dug in and defended well			2
‘ there are times when you have to dig in and the boys were magnificent in that respect			2
i have been involved in so many games where we play well and get nothing			0
‘ six points in two games is all you can ask for , ’ he added			2
early goal : @entity29 's goal turned out to be the only goal of the match - click here to view the @entity161 statistics from this weekend 's game at the @entity163 in the net : @entity8 goalkeeper @entity33 looks on in despair after the ball nestles into his net in the first half of the @entity40 encounter all smiles : @entity60 ( left ) and @entity0 ( right ) share a joke before saturday 's @entity40 match major battle : @entity30 midfielder @entity47 tries to wrestle @entity8 striker @entity72 off the ball mins @entity176 @entity30 total 113.1 70.3 @entity49 90 12.9 8.0 @entity46 90 11.7 7.3 @entity42 90 11.6 7.2 @entity8 total 107.3 66.7 @entity65 90 11.4 7.1 @entity177 90 10.8 6.7 @entity66 90 10.7 6.7 data courtesy of the @entity179 , the @entity180 of the @entity40 initially , this looked like it could be a terrible afternoon for @entity0			1
within a minute he was on his feet ; within three @entity30 had an excellent chance			1
@entity47 won possession in his own half before the ball found @entity50 on the right			0
he jinked into the box , saw that @entity52 had been given too much space near the penalty spot and delivered a perfect cross			0
@entity62 cleared the @entity194 ’s header off the line			0
@entity72 then volleyed over , but for the first half that was as good as it got for @entity8			1
their main issue , in the early stages , was midfield — or , more precisely , their lack of one			0
@entity30 ’s 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 system and the extra man they were afforded against a 4 - 4 - 2 proved significant , even if @entity47 was having one of those days in midfield where his good and sloppy traits took turns to show up			1
in one five - minute passage of the first half he passed straight into touch			1
then he hit a precise pass 50 yards into the path of @entity50 , who was wide on the left			0
the winger beat @entity61 and his low cross perfectly met the run of @entity49			0
the @entity219 midfielder glanced his shot from seven yards when something a little more forceful would have done the job			0
@entity33 made the save but it was a major let - off , albeit a temporary one			2
within a further five minutes , @entity30 were ahead			1
@entity49 was involved , playing a through - ball from the middle that @entity64 reached but allowed to squirm past			2
@entity29 took possession , motored away from @entity64 and carried on his surge into the area when @entity63 continued to back away			1
@entity33 got a hand to the near - post shot but not enough to stop it			2
@entity0 estimated earlier this month that he had made 500 calls over transfers in a bid to keep @entity8 up			1
he has acknowledged he might need to make a few more over the next week			0
@entity52 miskicked from the edge of the area after the restart and @entity0 ’s jacket came off			0
@entity60 , new to a suit after feeling he ‘ earned the right to wear one ’ in his caretaker spell last season , was less ruffled , despite a less than energetic start to the second half			0
@entity30 almost paid for their lethargy when @entity72 took possession on the left of the @entity30 area and threaded a pass to @entity66 , whose shot across goal beat @entity41 but was heading wide			1
@entity70 was inches away from connecting with a lunge			0
it was close , but not close enough			0
and @entity0 will know that simply wo n’t do			0
lining up : referee @entity80 gets his vanishing spray can out to mark out @entity30 's defensive wall up for the challenge : @entity29 , pictured tackling @entity8 defender @entity86 , proved to be the match winner for the @entity263 side clean sheet : @entity8 failed to find a way of getting past former @entity266 goalkeeper @entity41 at the @entity163			1
