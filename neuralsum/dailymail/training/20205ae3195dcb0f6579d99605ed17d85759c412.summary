by @entity1 reporter published : 17:07 est , 28 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:43 est , 28 february 2014 a new survey by the @entity5 has revealed millions of patients wait as long as three weeks to see their gp millions of patients wait as long as three weeks to see their gp , a @entity5 survey reveals today			1
only one in three manages to secure a same - day appointment , despite @entity12 promises to make such slots routinely available			1
one in five can not get a consultation within seven days			1
the survey suggests that two million adults wait between two and three weeks to see a doctor and half a million suffer a delay of three or four weeks			2
leading gps say the figures reflect their struggle to meet the demands of a growing population with ever larger numbers of pensioners			2
and they are increasingly worried about late diagnosis of deadly illnesses such as cancer and lung disease			0
@entity30 , of the @entity31 , said : ‘ we do worry on patient safety grounds that access is becoming more of a problem			1
‘ take someone who ’s had a cough for four or five weeks			0
the chances are that it ’s a long - running cough from a viral illness			2
but what if they ’ve got @entity42 , what if they ’ve got lung cancer ? if it does turn out to be cancer or @entity42 then the quicker they ’re dealt with the better			0
’ @entity49 , a @entity51 primary care chief , said : ‘ gps who have been the bedrock of the @entity54 are struggling , seriously struggling			2
they are particularly struggling in @entity55			2
‘ as we get older , as we live longer , we are putting more strain on general practice			0
it would not be unusual for @entity52 to see 40 to 50 patients in any one day			1
’ dr @entity49 is helping to draw up new guidelines for @entity52 in @entity55 – which may later be adopted across the country – to make it easier for patients to see their doctor			1
they will urge surgeries to offer phone consultations as well as ensure @entity52 and nurses are freed up to offer more same - day appointments			1
the @entity5 ’s survey – in collaboration with over- @entity72 – asked 11,019 adults how long they waited the last time they saw a family doctor			1
twenty - two per cent had to wait longer than a week and 4 per cent had to wait two to three weeks			2
another 1 per cent waited longer than three weeks and a handful waited longer than a month			2
nationally , 4 per cent equates to two million people and 1 per cent to 500,000			0
many practices now offer same - day appointments only to those prepared to queue outside from the moment a surgery opens			1
in autumn the @entity83 watchdog reported that some patients have resorted to taking stools to make their wait more bearable			0
surgeries have also become busier because fewer gps work at evenings and weekends			0
a contract , which was negotiated under @entity91 in 2004 , allowed them to opt out , meaning services are now largely run by private firms employing locums			0
many patients would rather wait and try for an appointment with their own doctor on the monday morning – which is when surgeries are busiest			0
the @entity5 survey – carried out over a period of ten days on the internet this month – also found it is much harder to book an appointment now than it was just five years ago			1
forty - nine per cent said it was difficult or very difficult , compared with 21 per cent in november 2008			0
dr @entity30 from the @entity31 of @entity52 ( left ) warned patient safety could be compromised while @entity49 , a @entity51 primary care chief , ( right ) warned gps are ' seriously struggling ' especially in @entity55 one in three people manages to see their family doctor on the same day as calling for an appointment despite @entity12 promises from @entity113 's @entity112 , that these slots would be made routinely available			1
one in five patients can not get a consultation within seven days the situation is worst in @entity55 , where 27 per cent wait more than a week and 1 per cent wait a month			2
@entity118 said : ‘ having to wait ten days to a fortnight is quite common and quite often you will hear of people waiting three weeks			0
‘ you have to wait longer if you want to see your own doctor – it ’s easier if you ’ll see any locum who ’s popped into the surgery for a couple of weeks and will never be seen again			0
‘ for most people locums are n’t satisfactory			0
if you ’ve got an ongoing problem you do n’t want to discuss it with someone you ’ll never see again			0
’ the lack of gp appointments has partly been blamed for the crisis in @entity136 units			1
@entity54 figures show that half of patients arriving in casualty need no treatment			0
health secretary @entity113 has urged gps to provide more same - day appointments as one measure to ease the pressure in @entity136			1
@entity146 , chief executive of the @entity147 , said : ‘ unless urgent action is taken , we are going to see increasing pressure being placed upon an already overstretched @entity136 system , as patients visit the emergency departments in desperation			1

@entity5 survey shows one in three can not get a same - day appointment
one in five fail to get a consultation within seven days
@entity31 of @entity52 say patient safety could be compromised
