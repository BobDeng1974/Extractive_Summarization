goalkeeper @entity0 deserves his place as @entity3 number one , according to double winner @entity4			1
the @entity5 international has found his position under the spotlight this week following reports he was caught smoking in the showers after @entity3 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity12 on @entity13 , when his errors played a part for both goals			1
it has been suggested the player will be fined around £ 20,000 for his alleged misdemeanour , and it remains to be seen whether the 24 - year - old will be back between the posts for sunday 's @entity25 game against @entity26 at the @entity27 after he was replaced by @entity29 @entity28 for last weekend 's @entity30 tie versus @entity31 - a move always planned by @entity34 boss @entity33			1
@entity3 goalkeeper @entity0 was fined £ 20,000 for smoking in the showers at @entity12 @entity0 's father @entity37 , meanwhile , insists his son should not be singled out for @entity3 's defensive shortcomings , declaring centre - half @entity40 ' showed the agility of a rhinoceros ' as the team let in the first goal at @entity12			1
@entity4 - who made more than 300 appearances for @entity3 and helped them win the 1971 @entity48 and @entity30 double before returning to the club as a goalkeeper coach - believes @entity0 should not be ostracised for one high - profile poor performance			1
' @entity54 deserves to be the @entity3 number one at this time , ' @entity4 said in an interview with the @entity57			1
@entity0 left his goal unattended as @entity12 opened the scoring during the defeat on @entity13 ' @entity61 looked pretty good at the @entity62 and he looked fine in the @entity31 game			1
he made a couple of really good catches and made one save low down , but that is all he had to do			2
it was n't a serious test			2
' what niggles me about this recent criticism ( of @entity0 ) after the @entity12 game is that if people go back four days to the @entity76 game ( on december 28 ) , his performance was so good he won us the three points			1
' if you are looking for incidents to blame him , put the first goal at @entity12 against him , fine , but do n't start arguing with me about the second goal because it was not his fault			2
@entity28 started @entity3 's @entity30 victory against @entity31 on sunday and did n't disappoint ' any goalkeeper will tell you , lying on the floor with the opposition closing in on you , you make contact and you have no chance to get any leverage on it			1
it could go anywhere as a result of a situation not of his making			2
' he did not have his best game , but most ex-keepers would say the last thing you want to do with your number one goalie is give him a rest			0
if i was goalkeeping coach there now and @entity33 was asking me , i would say , '' do n't drop him			2
'' ' every goalkeeper makes mistakes			0
i spend a lot of time with @entity114 and all anybody asks him was , ' what happened with @entity117 ( against @entity118 at the 2002 @entity62 ) and @entity121 ? ( in the 1995 @entity120 final )			0
' the people in the know should recognise who is the best goalkeeper there ( at @entity3 )			2
' @entity4 ( right ) used to be @entity3 's goalkeeper coach , in training with @entity114 and @entity33 @entity4 , the 73 - year - old who retired from his @entity3 role in 2002 , but remains involved at the club and promotes charity work for the @entity133 , understands all too well how testing a career as the last time of defence can be			1
' it should n't affect you , but sometimes it does because you are n't in the best place , ' he said			0
' @entity54 seems to be a very confident , phlegmatic boy			0
a problem has cropped up here and he has to remain totally focused			0
' the only time i can give a similar example was after we had won the double , i got carried off in the semi-final of the 1972 @entity30 and was out for six or seven months			0
@entity4 has backed @entity0 to regain his form and confidence after the defeat at @entity12 ' i came back the following season and we lost 5 - 0 at @entity152			1
every newspaper said , '' this is the end of @entity4			0
'' my kids came back from school crying because the other kids had said , '' your @entity155 is useless			0
'' ' the next game was @entity161 away			0
we won , i had a blinder and my place in the team was assured			0
' you must never believe you are anything less than good enough and always think you are better than the guy challenging you			0
@entity54 needs to keep his confidence high			0
' @entity33 is expected to step up efforts to bring in some much - needed defensive cover as the january transfer window continues , with @entity174 captain @entity173 and @entity176 's @entity175 reported targets .			1
