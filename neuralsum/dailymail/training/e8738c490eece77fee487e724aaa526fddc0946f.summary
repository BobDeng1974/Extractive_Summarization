@entity0 and @entity1 are facing questions about their roles in the controversial @entity5 bid after @entity6 claimed he had discussed it with both men			0
mr @entity6 said he raised the subject with the prime minister during a cosy @entity12 dinner at the @entity14 home of former @entity16 boss @entity15			1
@entity17 spent months dodging questions about that occasion , which took place on december 23 , 2010 , two days after business secretary @entity21 had been stripped of responsibility for the bid and culture secretary @entity24 had taken charge			0
cosy relationship : @entity0 and former @entity16 boss @entity15 together			2
@entity6 discussed the @entity5 takeover with the prime minister at her dinner initially , @entity30 refused to provide a date or even suggest whether the dinner took place – and when it did , sources were quoted as saying neither @entity36 ’s takeover bid for @entity5 nor the phone hacking scandal were discussed			1
top gear host @entity38 , a guest at the dinner as another member of the so - called ‘ @entity43 set ’ , insisted : ‘ @entity5 was not mentioned			2
’ the prime minister himself later told @entity47 he ‘ never had one inappropriate conversation ’ with mr @entity6 and ‘ completely took myself out of any decision making about this bid ’			1
but appearing at the @entity52 inquiry yesterday , mr @entity6 , 41 , revealed he had used the @entity12 get - together to seek assurances from the @entity45 about @entity16 ’s plans to buy @entity5			1
he said he wanted to know that @entity24 , the new minister overseeing the bid , would be more ‘ objective ’ than his ‘ acutely biased ’ predecessor @entity57			2
mr @entity6 said he and mr @entity0 discussed the revelation that mr @entity21 had been caught privately ‘ declaring war ’ on the @entity6 empire , a disclosure which meant mr @entity24 being handed responsibility for the bid			0
little chat : mr @entity6 told the @entity52 inquiry that he had a ' tiny , side conversation ' with the prime minister about the takeover of @entity5 ahead of a dinner for up to 15 people at the @entity43 home of mrs @entity15 ‘ he reiterated what he had said publicly , which is that the behaviour had been unacceptable , and i imagine i expressed the hope that things would be dealt with in a way that was appropriate and judicial , ’ mr @entity6 said			1
‘ it was a tiny conversation ahead of a dinner where all these people were there , so it was n’t really a discussion			0
’ mr @entity0 was accused last year of breaking @entity47 ’s ministerial code of conduct , which requires ministers to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest , by attending the @entity12 dinner , a claim which was dismissed			2
but for the prime minister , the revelations about the @entity12 dinner mark an unwelcome return to the subject of his closeness to mrs @entity15 , the former chief executive of @entity16			1
it also has uncomfortable echoes of last month ’s ‘ horsegate ’ saga , in which mr @entity0 was reluctant to admit riding a retired police horse that mrs @entity15 had been loaned by the @entity101			1
he was eventually forced to confess he may have ridden the horse with mrs @entity15 ’s racehorse owner husband @entity103 , a friend from their @entity104 days			1
scrutiny of mr @entity0 ’s friendships with @entity16 executives is likely to be heightened by another disclosure by mr @entity6 yesterday – that he personally informed him @entity109 would be backing the @entity110 at the next election			0
over drinks at @entity113 in @entity114 on september 10 , 2009 , mr @entity6 said ‘ it was made clear to mr @entity0 by me ’ that @entity109 would be switching allegiance from @entity117			0
dinner hosts : mrs @entity15 and her husband hosted the @entity12 meal at their home in the @entity14 the media baron denied this was part of a deal to trade favours with mr @entity0			1
his wife , @entity127 , who was sitting in the public gallery along with mr @entity6 ’s brother @entity129 , was overheard saying ‘ outrageous ’ when this suggestion was put to her husband			2
the inquiry heard how @entity6 had met mr @entity0 a total of 14 times , 12 of them before he became prime minister			1
there were seven breakfasts , lunches and dinners between june 2006 and may 2009 for what mr @entity6 said were the purposes of ‘ general social conversation ’ , often with their wives present			0
mr @entity0 dined at mr @entity6 ’s @entity114 home in september 2009 , nine days before @entity109 switched allegiance to the @entity148 , and on november 2 that year , @entity6 and @entity15 joined mr @entity0 for breakfast , to discuss ‘ politics ’			1
the two men have met only twice since mr @entity0 became @entity45 , once at the @entity12 dinner and a lunch at @entity154 in november 2010			2
mr @entity6 said he was ‘ curious ’ as to @entity0 ’s views ‘ on a variety of topics ’ when he met him			0
@entity159 probe : @entity15 , pictured with media mogul @entity36 , was first arrested under @entity160 last july it also emerged that @entity162 and @entity163 invited @entity6 to @entity154 for lunch when @entity117 were in power , and he met @entity166 three times – all three at the request of mr @entity166			2
mr @entity6 told the inquiry yesterday he was also ‘ friendly ’ with mr @entity1 and had visited the chancellor ’s grace and favour house , @entity173 in @entity174 , with his family			0
@entity0 and @entity16 chief executive @entity15 and her husband @entity103 are at the heart of what has become known as the ‘ @entity179 ’			2
it is made up of powerful political and media figures who have homes in a tiny triangle in one of the most scenic parts of @entity187 – the @entity14			0
the group go to the same house parties , dine together and even ride together			0
key players in the ' set ' also include @entity191 presenter @entity38 and daughter of media mogul @entity36 , @entity193 who is married to pr fixer @entity194			0
they met socially until the phone hacking scandal erupted			2
he claimed he had a discussion with the chancellor about @entity201 ’s bid to take over @entity5 , which was eventually dropped last july after a public outcry over the revelation that the @entity204 hacked murdered schoolgirl @entity206 ’s phone			0
mr @entity6 said his conversation about the proposed buy - out of the satellite broadcaster with the chancellor ‘ would have just been to be grumpy about it taking a long time and being referred to ( regulator ) @entity213 , which i was very clear in public about at the same time ’			0
last night @entity117 mp @entity216 raised questions about the response from the then cabinet secretary sir @entity219 – now lord @entity219 – to his questions last year about conversations between the prime minister and mr @entity6 regarding the @entity5 bid			1
last july , the mp was told that decisions ‘ were at all times taken properly and in accordance with the relevant legislation ’			0
lord @entity219 concluded : ‘ the prime minister was not the decision maker			1
nor did he seek to influence the decisions of the @entity231 , @entity24			0
‘ the fact that he had meetings with @entity15 and @entity6 last year is a matter of public record			2
‘ the fact that the prime minister was not the decision maker meant that he would not have had to consult me before meeting them			1
’ but mr @entity216 said : ‘ the ex-cabinet secretary and prime minister both face critical questions that must be adequately answered			1
‘ why was there no investigation carried out last year into the prime minister ’s dealings with @entity6 regarding the @entity5 bid ? ’ a @entity17 spokesman denied that journalists had been misled last year , insisting it had been right to say mr @entity0 had not been involved in formal discussions about @entity5			1
these are the meetings @entity6 held with senior @entity254 politicians disclosed by the @entity255 : meetings with @entity0 as leader of the opposition : june 26 2006 dinner at @entity259 in @entity114 , at which the @entity110 leader talked about his ‘ vision for the country ’ to a group of business executives wooing the @entity265 : @entity0 and @entity6 together in 2007 while the @entity110 leader was in opposition july 4 2006 dinner hosted by @entity1 and his wife @entity269 attended by mr @entity6 , his wife @entity270 , mr @entity0 and his wife @entity271 april 4 2007 dinner with mrs @entity127 and mrs @entity273			0
