being woken up early by excited children is a feeling that every parent will know all too well			2
so spare a thought for this male lion in @entity5 who was given a very early wake - up call by his two eager cubs			1
@entity8 may be the king of the beasts , but that did n't stop his children @entity11 and @entity13 from treating him like just another plaything			2
this is the moment two lion cubs called @entity17 and @entity13 gave their sleepy father @entity8 an early - wake up call aspiring wildlife photographer @entity20 , 24 , captured dad 's very unimpressed look as he was woken up ms @entity20 captured the images while working in @entity5 as a volunteer on the @entity26 game reserve @entity20 , 24 , captured the stunning pictures as the tiny cubs pounced on to the male lion and bashed him with their paws			1
aspiring wildlife photographer @entity20 spotted the cubs at the @entity26 game reserve in @entity5 as they played around on the savannah			1
she said : ' i was volunteering at a private game reserve called @entity39 in the @entity40 of @entity5			2
' i 'd been assisting the team in monitoring , observing and collecting data on all the endangered species , one of which is a pride of lions			2
' @entity8 , who is the handsome male lion , was the only fully - grown male at the reserve , so he was king , never having a rival			0
the adult lions were trying to sleep after a night out prowling but the playful cubs had other ideas i 'm awake : seemingly oblivious to his father 's bad mood , the cub continues batting at his mane @entity17 and @entity13 are part of a pride of endangered lions that are carefully monitored at the nature reserve ' there are four lionesses in this pride , so @entity8 had plenty to choose from			1
' this is the second time i 've visited but the first time i 've seen the cubs - they were very cheeky , playful and curious			0
' i was surprised because we did n't have to wait long as the whole family emerged out of the bush into the clearing enjoying the morning sunshine			0
' the two adults sat down tired after a long night on the prowl , however @entity11 and @entity13 were rolling and tumbling full of energy			1
' the photographer , originally from @entity80 , said the lion looked less than impressed with the early wake up call			0
back to sleep : one of @entity8 's cubs hides his eyes from the morning sun having just woken him up there are four lionesses in the pride , but there has never been another lion , meaning @entity8 has never had a rival ... that is until he had children photographer ms @entity20 said @entity8 was very patient with his children , but added : ' if they were n't his , i think it would have been a different story ' @entity20 added : ' the cubs tried to catch their dad 's attention in some play but he was not interested			1
' despite their enthusiasm he just let his offspring jump and jostle him without any problem			0
' they are his two cubs , so it was not dangerous for them to be near him			0
if they were n't his , i think it would have been a different story			0
