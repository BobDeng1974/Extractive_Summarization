while many of us will try and catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse tomorrow morning , the striking astronomical phenomenon may confuse animals			1
experts have warned that darkening skies could make nocturnal animals such as owls more alert and cause creatures that are usually awake during the day , such as sheep , to find a place to sleep - as well as possibly silencing songbirds			1
while animals may not react as strongly as during a total eclipse , zoos are still preparing for the partial eclipse that will see skies darken slightly across the @entity18 at around 9.30am tomorrow morning			1
the left - hand animation shows the totality of the 1999 eclipse			0
the right - hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 march will travel over @entity31 @entity32 , @entity33 at @entity34 told @entity35 : ‘ a solar eclipse , especially a full eclipse , could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation			1
‘ here at @entity46 ’s @entity45 , we ’ll amend the lighting slightly to counter this during the partial solar eclipse on the 20 march			2
’ an expert from @entity34 told @entity35 that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies ( an owl butterfly is shown ) tomorrow , the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over @entity59			1
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the @entity18 , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in @entity34 , @entity66 will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , meaning that animals in @entity73 may react more strongly than those in the south of @entity76			1
the most ‘ complete ’ eclipse in the @entity18 will be seen from @entity78 in the @entity79			1
timings will vary , so that in @entity34 , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will begin at 8.24am			0
the eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am , the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end			0
for spectators in @entity71 , for example , the eclipse will begin , peak and end four minutes later			0
@entity98 , vice president of the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) told @entity35 : ' it will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun , ’ but anecdotes from past partial eclipses hint that animals will still notice the change			1
@entity109 , @entity110 at the @entity111 , told @entity35 that the most people will notice that many of the common birds might stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer			2
. ' farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night , ' he said , before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks , they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on			1
professor @entity109 also said that pet dogs and cats will probably be ' sightly disturbed ' by tomorrow 's eclipse			1
they 'll notice it will get dark , ' he said , before adding : ' although night happens every day , you do n't have a substantial change in light intensity in the morning , so it 's a bit disturbing for them			2
' dogs , for example , will probably be more alert and pay more attention to what 's going on around them more then usual because they will be ' sightly surprised '			1
the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in @entity34 and around 94 per cent in @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71			0
a partial eclipse will be visible across @entity31 , @entity145 and @entity146 for about 90 minutes			0
this suggests that animals living nearer the arctic circle may react more strongly @entity150 , a biologist at the @entity151 in @entity152 told @entity153 that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark , because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘ night - time ’			2
for example , sheep ( stock image ) may find a place to sleep tomorrow projection : place a pinhole or small opening in a card , and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away			1
filters : the sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose			0
such filters have a thin layer of aluminum , chromium or silver on the surfaces			0
telescopes with solar filters : there are sun - specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse			0
@entity150 , a biologist at the @entity151 in @entity152 told @entity153 that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark , because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘ night time ’			2
she said : ' diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night : sleep ! ‘ dragonflies hide under a leaf , ants return to their nest , sheep walk back to their sleeping place , cattle egrets ( heron - like birds ) return to their nocturnal roost , diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop			1
’ ‘ nocturnal animals become active : owls hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on			1
’ bees may become more active during the partial eclipse , based on a study conducted in @entity214			2
experts at the @entity217 studied rock bees during an eclipse in june 1955 and found that when the sun was hidden behind the moon , 150 bees buzzed out of a hive , instead of the normal 25 or so , the @entity215 reported			0
‘ it would appear that during the partial solar eclipse on the 20th june , the rock bees became distinctly restless and more active , ’ @entity224 , who led the study said			2
during a partial eclipse in 2001 , desert cicadas in @entity229 fell silent in a break from their normal calling , suggesting similar insects such as crickets may do the same in the @entity18			1
the solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of @entity31			0
on the morning of the 20 march the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over @entity59 - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 august 1999 ( pictured over @entity247 ) ‘ nocturnal animals become active [ during an eclipse ] : @entity252 hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on , ’ one expert said experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse ’s shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy , it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication			1
in 1973 , researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse , indicating that native squirrels may notice tomorrow ’s unusual astronomical spectacles			1
in the study , the animals increased the length of this ‘ non-stop running sessions ’			2
there is also evidence that blue bulls changed the amount of time they spent eating and resting , hinting that cows ’ daily lives may be disrupted during tomorrow ’s partial eclipse			2
during a 2001 solar eclipse in @entity145 , self - proclaimed eclipse chaser , @entity287 witnessed strange animal behaviour in @entity291			0
it is guesswork as to how some birds may react tomorrow			1
some evidence points to blackbirds ( stock image ) singing during the astronomical event , while other other birds have fallen silent when the moon has blocked out the sun the eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across @entity31 , energy experts have warned			1
the spread of huge solar arrays across the @entity306 means that more than 10 per cent of the continent ’s electricity now comes from solar panels			0
with power supply so reliant on the sun ’s rays , the solar eclipse on 20 march might lead to blackouts			0
electricity system operators have warned that the eclipse poses ‘ an unprecedented test for @entity31 ’s electricity system ’			0
the @entity319 , a group of power supply organisations , said : ‘ the risk of incident can not be completely ruled out			0
‘ solar eclipses have happened before but with the increase of installed photovoltaic energy generation , the risk of an incident could be serious without appropriate countermeasures			0
’ the organisation said it had been planning so - called ‘ countermeasures ’ for months , with suppliers across @entity31 set to help balance the load with more energy from other power stations as solar electricity drops off			0
the eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in @entity18 because so little of our power comes from solar power			1
despite a boom in @entity18 solar arrays in recent years , particularly in southern @entity76 , solar power today provides just 1.5 per cent of our electricity needs			2
the @entity344 said it expected solar power output in @entity18 to halve from an average march figure of 3,000 megawatts to 1,700 megawatts			2
he said in a blog post that birds went to roost as the sky darkened , crickets and cicadas fell silent and even mosquitoes vanished			0
@entity354 , visiting professor of astronomy at @entity357 @entity356 , collected observations from 250 members of @entity360 ( @entity361 ) during the same eclipse			0
he wrote that hippos looked nervous and alert in a river , unsure if it was dawn or dusk and once the eclipse ended , there was a ‘ crescendo of loud dawn chorus - like calls ’ from turtle doves , after they had fallen silent though the event			0
‘ by contrast frogs in the river called at totality and ceased calling when the light reappeared , ’ he wrote			0
this observation may suggest that birds could cease singing in parts of the @entity18 tomorrow during the partial eclipse , while frogs may call loudly .			1

@entity385 will see skies darken across the @entity18 at around 9.30am tomorrow
@entity388 said it may affect the light of nocturnal moths and butterflies
expert claims dogs and cats may be ' sightly disturbed ' by unusual lighting
observations of previous eclipses hint that nocturnal animals such as owls may become more active , while daytime creatures may go to sleep
studies are split as to whether birds will sing or be silenced by the event
