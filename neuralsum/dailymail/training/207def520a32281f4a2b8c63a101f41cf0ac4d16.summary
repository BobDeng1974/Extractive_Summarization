a ban on assault weapons has been struck from the @entity3 's gun control bill , leaving out a major portion of gun control legislation that 's due to be revealed next month			1
@entity7 @entity6 , the sponsor of the ban , announced the decision by senate majority leader @entity11 today			1
the gun control bill will be debated by the @entity3 next month			1
instead , @entity6 said she will be able to offer her ban on the military - style firearms as an amendment			1
speaking out : @entity6 , the sponsor of the assault weapons ban , announced the decision to drop that portion of the bill gun rights issue : the assault weapons ban was the most controversial of the major proposals to restrict guns that have been advanced by president @entity25 and @entity26 she is all but certain to need 60 votes from the 100 - member @entity3 to prevail , but faces solid @entity30 opposition and likely defections from some moderate @entity26			1
' i very much regret it , ' @entity6 , a @entity32 from @entity33 , told reporters of @entity11 's decision			1
' i tried my best			0
' killer : @entity40 used an assault rifle when he murdered 20 children and six adults at @entity44 on december 14 asked about the decision , @entity11 said he wanted to bring a gun bill to the full @entity3 that would have enough support to overcome any @entity30 attempts to prevent debate from even starting			1
he said that ' using the most optimistic numbers , ' there were less than 40 votes for @entity6 's ban			1
that is far less than the 60 votes needed to begin considering legislation , and an indication that @entity11 feared that including the assault weapons ban in the main guns bill would risk getting the votes needed to begin debate			1
' i 'm not going to try to put something on the floor that wo n't succeed			0
i want something that will succeed			0
' i think the worst of all worlds would be to bring to something to the floor and it dies there , ' @entity11 said			2
@entity6 , an author of the 1994 assault weapons ban that expired after a decade , said that fellow democrat @entity11 , informed her of the decision yesterday			1
there are 53 democrats in the @entity3 , plus two independents who usually vote with them			2
an assault - type weapon was used by @entity40 in the december massacre at @entity44 in @entity78 , @entity79 , that revived gun control as a top issue in @entity82			0
it was also used in the ' @entity85 ' shooting spree in @entity86 , @entity87 , and the deadly @entity89 shooting of firefighters responding to a blaze in @entity92			0
pledge : @entity94 assault weapons was among the proposals @entity25 made in january in response to the @entity44 killings procedure : senate majority leader @entity11 said the gun control bill will face two votes after it goes up for debate next month banning those firearms was among the proposals president @entity25 made in january in response to those slayings			1
the assault weapons ban was the most controversial of the major proposals to restrict guns that have been advanced by @entity25 and @entity26			2
applications for gun permits have jumped in @entity78 , @entity79 , since a school massacre there revived the national debate on gun control and led to worries about new restrictions			0
@entity78 in recent years has issued about 130 gun permits annually			0
police say the town received 79 permit applications in the three months since the december 14 massacre , more than double the normal pace			0
@entity123 , records manager for @entity78 police , says many applicants have expressed concerns that their gun rights will be taken away			0
firearms sales have surged around the country , driven by @entity82 's new focus on gun control			0
20 first - graders and six adults were killed at @entity44 when @entity40 forced his way in and began opening fire in the hallway and in two classrooms			0
because of that , it had been expected that the assault weapons measure would be left out of the initial package the @entity3 considers , with @entity26 hoping the @entity3 could therefore amass the strongest possible vote for the overall legislation			2
having a separate vote on assault weapons might free moderate @entity147 senators facing re-election next year in @entity30 - leaning states to vote against the assault weapons measure , but then support the remaining overall package of gun curbs			0
gun control supporters consider a strong @entity3 vote important because the @entity30 - run @entity155 has shown little enthusiasm for most of @entity25 's proposals			2
@entity6 said @entity11 told her there will be two votes			1
one would be on her assault weapons ban , which also includes a ban on ammunition magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition			2
the second would just be on prohibiting the high - capacity magazine clips			0
many democrats think the ban on large - capacity magazines has a better chance of getting 60 votes than the assault weapons ban			2
the @entity174 has approved four gun control measures this month , including @entity6 's barring assault weapons and high - capacity magazines			1
the others would expand required federal background checks for firearms buyers , increase federal penalties for illegal gun trafficking and boost school safety money .			0

@entity7 @entity6 , the sponsor of the ban , announced the decision by senate majority leader @entity11 today
she says she can still present the ban as an amendment when its debated by the @entity3 next month
