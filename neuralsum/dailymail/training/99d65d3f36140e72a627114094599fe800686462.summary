if someone suggested you spent a well - earned holiday in a garden shed , you 'd perhaps politely decline			1
but now more and more people are opting to spend their precious time off in £ 2,000 a week luxury ' boltholes ' - which are strikingly similar to the humble garden shed			1
hundreds of the boltholes have been built in some of the country 's most rural areas to cater for the rise in people staying in the @entity12 for their holidays - known as ' staycationers '			1
a specialist website that handles the converted timber shacks says it is struggling to keep up with demand , - with most of the quaint holiday homes now let - out for most of the year			1
the site , @entity35 , lists 37 two - man boltholes , around half of which are located in the popular tourist areas of @entity27 and @entity40			2
others are dotted around @entity12 in picturesque areas such as the @entity43 , @entity18 , the @entity44 and the @entity45			1
@entity46 , spokeswoman for the company , said today : ' we have special properties of all sizes but the ones that do the best are the sleeps - two boltholes			2
quite the holiday home ! a bolthole in @entity55 , @entity27 , transformed into a fabulous holiday destination with panoramic sea views @entity59 view : a panoramic view from inside @entity62 holiday home ' people are tripping over themselves to book them			1
' these romantic boltholes come from the most unlikely of beginnings , from run - down sheds to old beach huts			1
' they are turned into luxury hideaways and they are proving a real hit because they offer couples privacy , seclusion , luxury and romance in unique settings			2
' what started out as a showroom for her interior design company ended up becoming a real money maker for mother - of - two @entity84			2
she spent just £ 10,000 turning a roofless , disused garage at her house in @entity18 into a £ 3,200 a month retreat			1
the 46 - year - old had found herself struggling to pay the bills and her large mortgage			1
idyll : mrs @entity93 outside her renovated bolthole in @entity18 - which earns her £ 3,200 a month but now the income from the renovated garage , called @entity98 in @entity18 , pays the £ 300,000 mortgage on her 136 - acre estate - and more			1
speaking outside the bolthole , mrs @entity93 said : ' i was using the garage to store products for my interior design company but it did n’t have a roof and birds were making a mess in there			2
' i decided to renovate the garage and use it to show off my products			0
' i did most of the work myself and did n’t skimp on anything - it is all the best you can get			2
neutral decor : inside the luxurious holiday let - which cost £ 10,000 to transform ' the house was featured in a few magazines and they suggested i looked into letting it out through @entity35			1
' it went onto their site in the middle of may and the first booking came in five days later			0
' bookings have been coming in thick and fast since then			0
' each month i ’m getting about £ 3,200 just from letting out the hideaway which is double my mortgage			1
' it cost @entity130 just £ 6,500 to buy a ramshackle timber shed perched on the top of a 300ft cliff overlooking @entity55 in @entity27			2
@entity130 bought the derelict shack while at university 25 years ago , and it remained unused for long after			0
but now he and wife @entity136 have invested £ 100,000 into turning it into a luxury , cosy bolthole that has a kitchen , lounge , bedroom , shower room and sun terrace			1
before : @entity62 stood as a ramshackle blue shed for 25 years before its transformation the chalet , called @entity62 , is booked up until the end of summer and costs up to £ 1,500 to hire for a week , pictured in its current glory below			2
mr @entity130 , 47 , who runs a marine services business , said : ' i worked as a lifeguard on the beach below and bought the leasehold for the chalet for £ 6,500			2
' i just bought it to live in it while i was at @entity158			0
' it was nothing more than an wooden shack on a cliff with one room and an outside loo			0
it was three metres by two metres and nothing more than a shed			0
out to sea : the property looks completely different after its £ 100,000 renovation ' i lived in it for 18 months and nearly got blown away with it a few times			1
' i left it as it was for 25 years and could n’t really afford to do anything with it			0
' it has only been the last 18 months that we managed to get the funding and planning permission in place that we could really do something with it			0
' we are delighted with how it has turned out and has been designed to make the most of the views			0
it is really romantic getaway			0
' people are happy to pay the rental price for it because of the views and the high standard finish			0
' former tv producer @entity192 , right , spent £ 150,000 doing up three decrepit 600 - year - old barns on her @entity27 farm - and now rakes in £ 81,000 a year in revenue			1
mrs @entity192 , 61 , was among the first to list a property with @entity35 after buying the 2.5 acre @entity197 listed @entity198 near @entity199 in 2002			0
her three renovated eco-homes - @entity201 , the @entity202 and @entity203 - all pictured after and before renovation below , cost up to £ 900 a week to rent			1
she is now planning the renovation of two more barns on the site which would take her income from the lettings to £ 135,000			0
mrs @entity192 said : ' i bought the farm with the pure intention to renovate the barns			0
' they were beautiful stone buildings but they were totally derelict			0
transformed : @entity192 's collection of three outbuildings on her @entity27 farm that are popular with couples before : the outbuildings , pictured before work began , were once dilapidated and unused ' i was adamant i wanted them to retain their rustic charm and still look like 600 - year - old barns			1
' it took a lot of work , made harder because the buildings are listed , but it was worth every second			0
' each cottage brings in around £ 27,000 a year			1
i ’m delighted and my accountant is too			0
