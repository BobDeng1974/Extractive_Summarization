pictures of @entity2 drinking in pubs with mystery women on his arm is part of what makes @entity8 great , @entity0 claimed today as he attacked @entity9 for fuelling fears about globalisation			1
the former prime minister mocked mr @entity2 ’s image as a drinking , womanising populist who fuels fears about globalisation			1
mr @entity0 insisted the rise of @entity9 – topping the @entity21 elections last month – was not the result of public anger over immigration or @entity21 , but fears about the ‘ juggernaut ’ of global change and @entity8 ’s place in the world			1
former prime minister @entity0 warned @entity30 against thinking the rise of @entity9 was the result of anger over immigration or @entity21 the @entity30 is divided about how to respond to the threat from @entity9 after seeing support switch in heartland working class seats in the north			1
work and pensions spokesman @entity40 warned that blue - collar supporters felt @entity9 understood their fears better while @entity43 insisted : ‘ we ca n’t imitate @entity9 , we have got to take them on			2
’ but despite being part of the @entity30 government which opened the doors to eastern @entity21 and handed more powers to @entity48 , mr @entity0 claimed @entity30 had to make the case for opening up the @entity8 economy to rest of the world			1
and he ridiculed mr @entity2 , who has often been pictured drinking in pubs and last week faced questions after returning to his hotel at a tourism conference in @entity57 at 4am with an attractive woman			2
mr @entity2 dismissed allegations of inappropriate behaviour as ‘ fluff and nonsense ’ , saying : ‘ i did n’t go to bed with her			2
’ speaking at press gallery lunch in @entity66 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity8 can not be @entity8 without seeing a photograph of @entity2 with a pint in his hand and a mystery woman lady in the other hand			1
’ he went on : ‘ @entity8 can not be @entity8 these days , a new permanent fixture by the way , without the @entity74 coming in sixth place			2
‘ @entity8 can not be @entity8 unless at some point you have a @entity78 as well as welsh or northern @entity83 prime minister and not simply @entity80 prime minister			1
mr @entity0 joked that part of @entity8 was @entity2 's love of drinking and @entity88 's @entity87 now finishing sixth in elections , after woeful results in the @entity21 elections and @entity92 by - election ‘ @entity8 can not be @entity8 without @entity78 being part of the @entity8 and without @entity78 @entity8 will not be @entity8			1
@entity78 assertiveness , sometimes @entity80 indifference			2
‘ there is a difference , and there is aggression but @entity78 and @entity8 go together and i do n’t want to see a future where the four nations of this @entity8 at a time when the world is becoming more integrated , societies are talking about interdependence and when it ’s absolutely important that we have co-operation in the future			1
’ he warned @entity30 leader @entity114 must not respond to @entity115 with tougher policies on migrant workers or the @entity118			0
instead @entity30 must make the case for @entity8 working more closely with foreign countries			0
‘ for me this is an issue about global change			0
people say it ’s an issue about immigration and it ’s an issue an issue about @entity21			2
‘ but it ’s about how we respond , and who gets the benefit from these massive changes , this juggernaut that is taking place as a result of the opening up of the global economy			0
’ mr @entity0 joked that he had been at a meeting at the @entity139 where protestors outside were carrying a banner declaring : ‘ worldwide campaign against globalisation			0
’ he went on : ‘ you know exactly what people meant			0
people feel that this alien to them			0
people feel that its unfriendly , people feel that they can not control the process of change , and it ’s about time that we showed that globalisation – that is the big processes of opening up the global economy – has a human face			0
‘ i frankly thought that when we had the @entity158 in 2009 and with @entity159 as president we would be able to do this , we would be able to show that you can manage globalisation in the interests of people			0
‘ but the retreat from global co-operation in the last few years makes it very difficult			0
‘ we have got to show for skilled workers , or people worried about skills , people who are worried about their security , people who are on low pay , that there is a future for their children that is more about skills security and decent employment			0
‘ it seems to me that that is the answer to @entity9 as it is the answer to @entity78 nationalism			1
