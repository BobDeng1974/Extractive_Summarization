for this is the ' annual report ' of the @entity13 - inspired @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , designed to demonstrate its power and attract funds from potential donors			1

this chart shows the number of explosive devices the group detonated in 2012 and 2013 @entity12 's aim appears to be to demonstrate its record to potential donors , and @entity51 says the annual report , the second published in as many years , destroys the myth that the insurgents are a rag - tag band of @entity82 militants			1

in its 2013 document , @entity12 says it took over eight cities , compared to one the previous year			2
