by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:28 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:59 est , 20 december 2013 ' we would never copy the @entity4 ' : @entity6 pm @entity5 has criticised the @entity4 's economic policy which he says has caused ' mass poverty ' the prime minister of france has launched a blistering attack on @entity4 economic policy – saying it is responsible for ' mass poverty '			1
@entity5 painted a picture of a @entity4 racked by extremes of wealth and poverty and said his own country would ‘ never copy ’ it - yet did not acknowledge that his country 's own economy was in crisis			1
asked about austerity cuts imposed by @entity4 prime minister @entity25 's coalition government , mr @entity5 said : ' @entity6 is about to regain the level of national wealth it had before the 2008 crisis , and @entity4 has still not got there			1
' so the situation in @entity4 , with the mass poverty that it generated is far worse than in @entity6			1
’ his remarks came as credit agency @entity34 's cut its long - term rating of the @entity36 by one notch to @entity38 + today , saying it had concerns about how the bloc 's budget was financed			1
the 63 - year - old @entity42 told tv channel @entity43 last night : ‘ i see a lot more poverty , more inequalities , and if i was to look for a model to reform @entity6 i would want to save the @entity6 model			1
’ he said that he would ‘ reform ’ @entity6 but ‘ certainly not copy what others do , especially not if we 're not talking about the best			1
’ mr @entity5 was particularly critical of @entity4 's zero - hour contracts under which employees agree to be available for work as and when required			1
‘ do you find this okay ? ’ he asked			0
‘ do you think the @entity6 would accept this ? this is not our policy			1
’ mr @entity5 ’s left - wing party is associated with turning @entity6 in one of the cushiest places for workers anywhere in the world			1
it brought in the 35 - hour week and – since mr @entity5 was appointed prime minister last year by president @entity70 – there have been a raft of other massively expensive measures			1
these have included a reduction in the retirement age from 62 to 60 for some categories of workers , a rise in the minimum wage and the introduction of a 36 - month rent freeze on new contracts			0
but , despite all this , the @entity6 economy is in crisis , and polls regularly show that mr @entity70 is the most unpopular president in the history of the country			1
mr @entity5 criticised the austerity cuts imposed by @entity25 ( left ) , but ignored the fact that the @entity6 economy is in crisis and that polls regularly show that president @entity70 ( right ) is unpopular there has been particular criticism of proposed top tax rate of 75 per cent , and mr @entity70 ’s admission that he ‘ dislikes the rich ’			1
mr @entity5 has just announced a controversial budget approving more tax rises and cuts in public spending in a bid to rein in the high public deficit			1
@entity4 chancellor @entity102 produced an autumn statement forecasting economic growth of 2.4 per cent in 2014 , with many commentators suggesting that recovery is well underway			1
meanwhile , the downgrade of the @entity109 economy by @entity34 was dismissed by @entity36 leaders and other officials as misguided			1
in a statement that came 11 months after it announced it had a ' negative ' outlook on the region , @entity34 said : ' in our opinion , the overall creditworthiness of the now 28 @entity36 member states has declined			1
' @entity36 budgetary negotiations have become more contentious , signalling what we consider to be rising risks to the support of the @entity36 from some member states			1
' @entity109 officials said they were not surprised by the move since @entity34 recently downgraded the @entity126 and has lowered its view on six other member states - @entity6 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 - in the past year			2
but they pointed out that the @entity36 has no debt or deficit to speak of and its budget is a stand - alone entity financed by 28 countries , making it one of the most stable institutions and most reliable borrowers in the world			1
@entity70 is the least popular @entity6 president in history , according to polls			1
‘ another couple of weeks , and we ’ll be able to call [ our supporters ] by their first names ! ’ a presidential adviser said bitterly the other day , summing up the mood at the presidential @entity150			0
the president had just been booed on @entity152			2
the prime minister was ridiculed in parliament by members of his own socialist party			0
protesters in @entity158 — who have taken to wearing red caps like their ancestors resisting the @entity162 ’s taxes — tore apart new toll gates on highways			0
farmers circled @entity166 with tractors , slowing down access for almost a day			0
truck drivers , poultry breeders , teachers , midwives , craftsmen , even riding instructors and their ponies have taken to the streets to yell at tax rises			1
across the eurozone , there are signs that economic conditions are improving — and yet in @entity6 there are daily demonstrations and business failures			2
representing only 8 per cent of the workforce , trade unions are unable to channel this anger			0
violent protests burst out and public outrage is stoked by the bonuses granted to @entity191			0
‘ @entity193 le bol ! ’ ( @entity194 is enough ! ) @entity6 is fuming with rage — and the party that is profiting from the situation is the far - @entity198			2
a year and a half into his mandate , @entity70 has run out of steam			2
despite the bravura of his foreign policy — @entity204 , @entity205 , if not @entity206 — the @entity6 now doubt his leadership abilities and competence of his government			2
the rumour is that cabinet members are already looking for other jobs			0
politicians and pundits compare scenarios : will the president change his prime minister ? will he call elections and risk losing his majority to the conservatives ? should he resign , as some suggest , even though , short of his committing murder , @entity6 institutions protect the president for the duration of his five - year mandate ? ‘ none of that will happen , ’ sighs the @entity150 adviser			1
‘ do n’t underestimate his capacity to stay put in the merde			0
’ an optimist and champion of economic cycle theory , @entity70 staunchly believes the situation can only improve , repeating against all odds that there is no recession , that unemployment will decrease by the end of the year , that public debt will diminish and welfare will be protected			1
history and his @entity42 predecessor as president , @entity245 , have convinced him that the @entity6 can not endure harsh facts , and that the art of politics starts with mincing words			1
his appeasement strategy has backfired			0
the @entity42 president was elected on the promise that the rich would pay			2
now almost everybody does — since 2009 , taxation has risen from 42 per cent to 46 per cent of gdp			0
the prime minister announced an overhaul of spending , a political coup to save his skin , but people worry that taxes will rise even more			2
@entity70 has been credited for taking small steps in the right direction — so small that competitiveness measures have not boosted business , job flexibility regulations have not paid off and neither have pension reforms			2
the public service system is about to become the largest proportionally in the world , at 57 per cent of gdp			0
the core of @entity70 ’s electorate are public servants , who resent not being rewarded more			2
beyond dire economic circumstances , the legalisation of gay marriage , pushed through parliament before the summer , has stirred up @entity6 society			2
shaken by globalisation , wary of immigration and deceived by electoral promises , people have reacted strongly			0
the opposition @entity287 party , weakened by internal fighting , has not benefited from government disarray			0
seventy - four per cent believe the conservatives would do no better			0
a new form of populism is emerging , more individualistic , a blend of anger at the elites , @entity295 , and at the sense of national drift			0
the @entity198 is revelling in all this			0
it is ahead in the polls for the forthcoming local and @entity109 elections			0
her political platform may be inconsistent , her economic programme inept , her anti-immigration stance deceitful , but party leader @entity306 speaks the language of the common man			0
the vocabulary of the extreme @entity295 is melting into common parlance , its racial undertones amplified by social media			0
@entity314 , the justice minister , born in @entity315 , and the eloquent champion of the gay marriage bill , has become the target of foul racial slurs			0
the political vacuum allows for less inhibited public speech and tactics			0
the @entity6 have gone through similar periods before , rage simmering without leading to radical change			2
the elites should brace themselves for the elections in the spring			0
