on the surface , the story behind @entity2 ’s remarkable march to the play - off final is a simple one			1
@entity6 was sacked as manager last september with the team languishing in 14th place , following four mediocre seasons finishing in the middle to lower reaches of the @entity13			1
in came former player and coach @entity15 who waved his magic wand – or some such action to that effect – and @entity2 were galvanised into a run of seven successive wins that propelled them into the top two			2
it is a neat and tidy narrative and one that the club ’s owners have been keen to promote , but such a simple interpretation grossly undervalues the diligent work done by the previous manager over the preceding four - and - a - half years			0
for while @entity15 has undoubtedly brought purpose and direction to a young and energetic collection of players , there is no escaping the fact this is ultimately @entity6 ’s squad – one that he patiently assembled under very trying circumstances			2
nine of the 11 players likely to start at @entity57 were either bought or nurtured by @entity6 , and the two great hallmarks of the team – a tight spirit built on humility and an attractive passing style – were very deliberately promoted by the previous regime			1
in truth , @entity2 ’s rise is not an overnight transformation but one that has been brewing for some time			0
it is necessary to rewind back to january 2009 , when @entity6 was appointed manager , to appreciate the firm foundations upon which @entity15 has sculpted his impressive team			1
key : @entity72 ( left ) and @entity73 ( right ) have flourished under @entity15 since joining on loan @entity2 v @entity40 , saturday 3pm ( @entity57 ) follow it live at @entity75 @entity6 took over a club in crisis , one in danger of sinking into the third tier of @entity81 football less than two years after dropping out of the @entity82			1
the @entity84 owners were realistic about the dire finances and set the son of @entity2 ’s most famous manager the arduous task of rebuilding the club from top to bottom on a shoestring budget			0
big earners and prima donnas were ditched and the manager was forced to work with players from the academy and lower leagues			0
but he did so with a clear long - term vision behind his careful actions			0
only hungry , hardworking and humble players would be allowed to wear the shirt			0
one of the first signings , @entity105 , was initially derided as little more than a pub player when he arrived from @entity108			0
but his wholehearted and unselfish performances at centre half showed the path to a strong team spirit , and he is now a cult hero among fans			0
@entity115 : will @entity120 ( centre ) , celebrating his audacious opener in the win over @entity119 , is one of the best young talents in the country goals : @entity125 was @entity2 's top scorer with 22 league goals while some of @entity6 ’s signings were born with such character , others were given the chance to reinvent themselves by joining this collective ethic			1
@entity125 , previously convicted of assault and banned from 68 @entity135 pubs , was plucked from @entity136 last year on a free transfer and told to step up to the responsibility of becoming a proper no 9			0
he is now the key and focus of all @entity2 ’s attacking play , scoring 25 of the team ’s goals this season , 22 of them in the league , and assisting in most of the others			2
@entity148 to these signings were a clutch of youngsters promoted from the club ’s restructured academy , most notably the much - coveted @entity120			2
two years ago @entity6 recognised in the slender 17 - year - old the courage to receive the ball in any situation and attempt to dominate possession			2
the team subsequently evolved around the teenager ’s vision and one - touch passing , and finally began playing the sort of football befitting a side managed by a man called @entity164			2
trophies : @entity15 won the @entity167 @entity166 whilst with @entity168 playing career spanning 13 years mostly for @entity170 was assistant to sir @entity172 at @entity173 and then twice for @entity174 managed @entity175 , @entity168 ( twice ) , @entity176 , @entity177 and now @entity2			1
managed @entity174 from 2006 until 2007 after previously being @entity179 's @entity178 trophies include the @entity181 in 2004 and the @entity166 in 2010 @entity182 may have been frustratingly slow but this season began with public pronouncements of finishing in the top six , and some of the early signs – a 5 - 1 away thrashing of @entity187 and a glorious goal after a 26 - pass move at @entity190 – were promising			2
but consistency remained elusive and the board lost patience after a 1 - 0 loss to local rivals @entity177 in september , the third defeat in eight days			0
while @entity6 ’s sacking was undoubtedly harsh , but the bold decision to hand @entity15 the task of fulfilling the team ’s potential has been vindicated in spectacular fashion			1
@entity15 has repeatedly acknowledged his great inheritance at @entity2 , and perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his success is that it is built on no more than minor tinkering and fine - tuning			1
it may well have been the case that @entity164 was too close to his project , and a fresh pair of eyes was needed to make the small – but significant – changes that have propelled @entity2 up the league table			0
@entity214 move : @entity217 's @entity216 has been very impressive on loan while @entity6 ’s team had a tendency to over-elaborate and sometimes keep the ball for the sake of it , @entity15 ’s charges play with more urgency and forward momentum			1
while @entity6 ’s desire to pick his best 11 footballers often meant putting square pegs in round holes , @entity15 has fitted the players into a clear 4 - 3 - 3 formation			1
and while @entity6 was inherently cautious and would try to preserve a 1 - 0 lead , @entity15 encourages his players to cast off their inhibitions and chase more goals			1
he has also been far bolder with substitutions and tactical changes , rescuing many points from seemingly hopeless causes by making an early switch in matches to playing four up front			0
records : @entity245 has had a breakthrough season in midfield , with 16 league goals but beyond this the team is largely unchanged , with only minor changes in personnel – most notably the @entity217 loanee @entity253 bringing solidity to a leaky defence and @entity73 borrowed from @entity256 to fill the crucial holding midfield position			0
it is tempting to wonder whether this very same success would have been overseen by @entity6 , had he been granted more time to see his work come to fruition ? or perhaps it did actually require someone with the experience and insight of @entity15 to accelerate the team ’s development by instilling greater positivity and self - belief ? rivals : @entity15 ( centre ) during his brief spell in charge of @entity177 it may even be the case that @entity2 did @entity6 a favour by jolting him out of his complacent comfort zone in the town where he grew up , for he is now enjoying at @entity277 the sort of rapid success that eluded him in his previous job			1
it is possible he just needed to be liberated from the giant shadow cast by his father ’s unmatchable accomplishments at @entity2			0
the management change has also brought a chance of redemption for @entity15 , whose image was tarnished by failure in charge of @entity174 , a sacking at @entity176 and resignations from @entity177 and @entity168 , not to mention the comical local accent he adopted while managing in @entity294			1
he is now flourishing back among those who love him and rediscovering what an excellent manager he can be at the club where he first experienced @entity81 football ’s top tier as a player and coach			0
if he returns @entity2 to the @entity82 he will deserve all the plaudits that come his way , but he knows the achievement will rest above all on having the good sense to recognise – where others did not – the many fine attributes in the team built by his predecessor .			2

@entity2 face @entity40 in the @entity13 play - off final at @entity57 on saturday
the former @entity174 boss has turned around the @entity319 ' fortunes by making tweaks to @entity6 's team
@entity15 has restored his *reputation* after fiasco in charge of national side
@entity120 is the shining light of the @entity2 team
