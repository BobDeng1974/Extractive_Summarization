an innocent man who spent years on death row after being tricked into confessing to a double murder says he finds it hard to forgive the people who put him in prison			1
@entity6 , 64 , admitted to the killings in 1999 as a result of an investigation by an anti-death penalty group which has since been accused of using threats and false promises to force the drug addict into his confession			1
the investigation by the @entity16 helped free death row inmate @entity17 just days before his execution , a case that was cited when the state announced a moratorium on capital punishment in 2003 and its abolition in 2011			1
that also spared @entity6 the death penalty , but he went on to serve 15 years in the @entity26 before being released after the @entity27 re-examined his conviction			2
he was released from @entity35 last week as he adjusts to life as a free man , @entity6 has spoken of his anger at the tactics used by the @entity16			1
speaking to @entity40 , he said : ' it was very hard to get along with knowing that fact - that i was locked up in prison for something i knew i did n’t do			0
' it can make you kind of mean , but as time went by i overcame it			0
' the @entity16 , led by former @entity34 journalism professor @entity50 , confronted @entity6 at his home claiming that the mother of one of the two victims of the 1982 shooting had placed him at the scene			1
days later , private investigator @entity57 and another man returned with flashing guns and police badges and urged him to confess if he wanted to avoid the death penalty			1
he denied any involved but the group persisted , promising him a light sentence and royalties from a book they were writing on the crime			0
they also showed him video of his ex-wife and another man who later turned out to be actor claiming they witnessed @entity6 commit the murder			2
' they did everything that ’s forbidden by the law enforcement community , ' @entity6 said			0
' these people went to great lengths to do what they did to me , and i never did anything to anyone			0
' @entity6 's attorney @entity84 claims the team , led by professor @entity50 ( pictured ) framed his client so death row inmate @entity17 could become a ' poster boy ' for the bid to end executions in @entity91 earlier this month , it was reported by the @entity93 that @entity6 's attorney @entity84 claimed the team of journalists and their professor at the @entity16 framed his client so @entity17 could become a ' poster boy ' in the bid to end executions in the state			1
@entity102 state attorney @entity101 added that the ' tactics and antics ' of the investigator , @entity57 in conjunction with @entity107 could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice and intimidation of a witness at the time			1
however it would be impossible to file charges because the statute of limitations has run out			0
@entity6 , wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison , told reporters outside @entity123 that he was angry			0
' i 'm not angry at the system			0
i 'm angry at the people who did what they did to me , ' he said , crying as he told reporters that his mother had died while he was behind bars			0
@entity6 was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison - he served 15			2
' poster boy ' : @entity17 ( pictured right after his release with @entity107 ) was sentenced to death after initially being convicted in the shooting of two people in @entity137 but the @entity138 began re-examining his conviction last year after his attorney presented evidence that he had been threatened with the death penalty and coerced into confessing with promises that he would get an early release and share in the profits from book and movie deals			1
@entity149 said he was tricked by a private investigator who stormed into his home and showed him a videotape of a man who said he had seen @entity6 pull the trigger			1
the man turned out to be an actor			0
' in the best interest of justice , we could reach no other conclusion but that the investigation of this case has been so deeply corroded and corrupted that we can no longer maintain the legitimacy of this conviction , ' @entity149 said			0
the @entity17 case helped lead former gov. @entity166 to declare a moratorium on executions in 2003 , and he cleared death row by commuting the death sentences of more than 150 inmates to life in prison			1
gov. @entity174 abolished the death penalty in 2011			0
@entity149 did not say whether she believed @entity6 is , in fact , innocent , but she said there were so many problems with the case			2
methods : @entity102 state attorney @entity101 added that the ' tactics and antics ' of @entity107 ( pictured hugging @entity17 ) could have added up to criminal charges or obstruction of justice frustration : @entity6 , wearing a grey hoodie and jeans when he was released from prison , told reporters outside @entity123 that he was angry at ' the people who did this to me ' one of them was what she called a coerced confession and the deaths of a number of key figures , making it impossible to determine exactly what happened on the morning of aug. 15 , 1982 , when two people were shot to death as they sat in a park on @entity137 's @entity207			1
she also said there remains powerful evidence that @entity17 was the gunman , including several witnesses who still maintain their original statements			0
' as i stand here today , i ca n't definitely tell you it was @entity17 who did this or @entity6 who did this , ' she said			2
@entity50 , who retired from @entity34 in 2011 amid questions about his investigative methods , has not responded to phone calls for comment , but has previously defended his methods and results			2
@entity224 , who like @entity107 has denied acting improperly , released a statement that emphasized that @entity6 confessed multiple times , including to a tv reporter and his own lawyer			2
' you explain that , ' @entity224 said			0
nonetheless , he added , no one should be in prison if the state did not meet its burden of proof			0
advancing claims : @entity17 spent 16 years on death row prior to his release			1
@entity91 put a moratorium in place on executions in 2003 and the death penalty was abolished in 2011			1

@entity6 , 64 , confessed to a double murder in @entity137 in 1999
it came as a result of an investigation from a team of students at @entity34 , led by professor @entity50
it helped free death row inmate @entity17 who was initially convicted
his case was cited when @entity91 put a moratorium on executions in 2003
@entity6 's attorney @entity84 claims the team of journalists , the professor and a private investigator framed his client
@entity17 would then be a ' poster boy ' for the bid to end capital punishment
attorneys said his confession was coerced and tactics used were ' criminal '
