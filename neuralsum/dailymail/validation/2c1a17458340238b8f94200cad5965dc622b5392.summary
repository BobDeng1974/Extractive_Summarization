plus - size fashion is a hard market to crack but with the average @entity4 dress size hitting 16 , many women are left frustrated by designers that seemingly have little knowledge of the female form or how women want to dress			2
and that is exactly why @entity11 , who pioneered the first - ever plus - size fashion week , want to change that			1
the high street store , which falls under sir @entity17 's @entity16 umbrella , set up an initiative last year with universities to teach students how to design plus - size clothes for the brand 's @entity11 range			1
@entity11 , which falls under sir @entity17 's @entity16 umbrella , is giving plus - size fashion a trendy edge @entity26 , @entity27 , wanted to change the way the next generation of fashion designers view plus - size			1
so , she asked students from @entity34 and @entity35 to design a six - piece collection that was fashion forward but not limited by size			1
a panel of industry experts were brought together in @entity40 to judge the competition			0
the panel included @entity43 ( @entity45 winner ) , @entity46 ( stylist for @entity48 and @entity49 ) , @entity50 ( @entity51 founder ) , among others			0

' the high street store set up an initiative last year with universities to teach students how to design plus - size clothes for the brand 's @entity11 range and now they stock the winner 's in store students from @entity34 and @entity35 were asked to design a six - piece collection that was fashion forward but not limited by size and @entity72 won with this colourful range the overall winner @entity72 , a @entity75 student at @entity34 , took inspiration for her collection from the underwater world			1
the result is an esoteric range that creates a silhouette aimed to fit and flatter			0
the @entity83 collection was chosen to open the @entity84 during @entity85 and is available to buy in @entity11 stores and online across the @entity4 , @entity88 and @entity89 now			2
