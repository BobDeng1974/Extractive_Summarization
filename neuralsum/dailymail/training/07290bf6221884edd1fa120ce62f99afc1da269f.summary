@entity0 today came under pressure from his own mps to lurch left in the wake of the victory for an anti-austerity party in @entity6			1
senior @entity8 politicians hailed the ' exciting ' victory for the left and demanded an end to ' savage cuts ' , piling pressure on @entity0 to oppose more spending cuts			1
and @entity15 @entity14 said the win by the left - wing @entity5 result ' marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model '			1
but @entity23 chancellor @entity22 warned against ' returning to economic chaos ' , insisting a change in direction would lead to higher unemployment			1
he has also pledged to reverse many of the reforms that @entity45 creditors demanded in exchange for keeping @entity6 financially afloat since 2010			2
that has placed the country on a collision course with @entity50 over its massive bailout deal , with @entity52 effectively saying the new @entity6 government can forget any kind of debt relief			2
the 40 - year - old was sworn in this afternoon , making him the youngest @entity6 prime minister for more than 150 years			2
with 101 days until the general election in the @entity60 , the result has been hailed by left - wing parties in who hope it will bolster their call to reverse the efforts to tackle nation 's deficit			1
reacting to the result today , mr @entity0 sought to distance himself from events in @entity6 : ' just like our elections are a matter for the people of this country , so who the @entity6 people elect is a decision for them			1
' it is the responsibility of the @entity60 government to work with the elected government of @entity6 for the good of @entity60 and @entity82 and not to play politics			2
' and it is up to each country to choose its own path on how to deal with the economic and social challenges they face			0
' we have set out our path for @entity60 : to make sure our country is fairer and more prosperous and balance the books			0
' but veteran leftwing @entity8 mp @entity94 said the @entity5 ' points the way to ending the era of austerity across @entity82 '			0
he added : ' nobody should underestimate the anger and the demand for change here			2
' former labour cabinet minister @entity36 , a close ally of @entity0 , declared : ' fantastic @entity5 win : austerity does not work for @entity6 , for @entity23 / @entity105 @entity60 , nor for @entity45 ; we all need investment in growth not savage cuts			1
' former labour cabinet minister @entity36 , a close ally of @entity0 , posted this message on @entity111 after the result was announced veteran leftwing @entity8 mp @entity94 said the @entity113 ' points the way to ending the era of austerity across @entity82 ' @entity116 , @entity8 mp for @entity117 , said he was ' delighted ' with the result in @entity6 more than a dozen @entity119 have called on @entity0 to lurch left , in the wake of the election victory secured by @entity5 in @entity6			1
a letter signed by 16 mps calls for an end to ' prolonged austerity ' , nationalisation of the railways and a return to collective bargaining and employment rights in the workplace			1
@entity8 mp @entity132 told @entity133 : ' jobs and growth are vitally needed rather than prolonged austerity as the best means both to cut the deficit fastest and to give hope to our people			2
' public ownership is urgently needed to reverse failed privatisations , and the railways should lead the way to a new perspective of the crucial role of the public sector			0
' and an enhanced role for the trade unions is strongly needed both to promote economic partnership in our workplaces and to reverse the extreme inequality now so badly disfiguring our society '			0
among the mps who have backed the letter are @entity157 , @entity94 , @entity116 , @entity158 and @entity159			0
@entity116 , @entity8 mp for @entity117 , said he was ' delighted ' with the result in @entity6 , adding : ' austerity con that 's increased poverty and made super-rich even richer has been dealt a severe blow			1
' @entity164 , @entity8 candidate in @entity165 , said austerity does not work and was ' punishing the poor for the mistakes made by the rich '			0
@entity169 , wrote on @entity111 : ' with @entity5 election win @entity6 has lit the way for the rest of @entity82 's battle against neo con austerity			1
' @entity175 , a @entity8 candidate in @entity176 , said : ' ' a major victory for the left and in fight against austerity , very exciting			1
' the @entity181 , which has called for an end to austerity , predicted the @entity6 result would be repeated in the @entity60 green mp @entity34 said she had been ' inspired ' by the ' huge vote ' for @entity5			1
' now @entity45 must listen to people & economists & respond with debt forgivenesss & support , ' she wrote on @entity111			0
@entity190 and @entity191 also called for an anti-austerity revolution in @entity60			0
' greens share the view of the new government that austerity is a failed model which has piled misery on the poorest while making the wealthiest even richer , ' they said in a statement			2
they added : ' this result shows that challenging business as usual politics can win the support of the people			2
' in the @entity60 we are witnessing a @entity208 , in no small part due to our anti-austerity agenda , and we hope the @entity6 election result marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model and failing governments across @entity82			1
' the @entity181 manifesto promises policy to give everyone in the country a ' basic citizen 's income ' of £ 72 a week regardless of wealth - at a staggering cost to the country of £ 280billion			0
the party also backs zero economic growth and falling levels of personal consumption and wealth as a way of protecting the environment			0
green mp @entity34 said she had been ' inspired ' by the ' huge vote ' for @entity5 prime minister @entity233 warned the result will ' increase economic across @entity82 ' and vowed to stick to his austerity programme but the @entity60 government insisted that diverting from the plan to reduce spending cuts would lead to economic chaos			1
mr @entity22 said relying on spending more money to get out of difficulties was a ' panacea , false hope '			0
' ultimately , if you take at face value all the things that the new @entity6 government has promised , including new big increases in public expenditure , i think that is going to be very difficult to deliver and incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members , ' he said			0
' but i hope that both sides now act responsibly			0
' everyone has in the past looked over the precipice of @entity6 exit from the euro and pulled back			0
it is certainly in the @entity60 's interest that we have stability , that we have proper dialogue here between members of the euro			0
' but ultimately what the @entity60 needs is a strong partner , and the institutions of the eurozone are not working well enough for the people of @entity82 , and that has an impact on us			0
' conservative mp @entity277 mp said : ' @entity5 will increase economic uncertainty across @entity82 , @entity0 wants to do exactly the same thing in the @entity60			2
' @entity60 currently has a long - term economic plan that works wile @entity0 offers only chaos and confusion			1
' in fact the views of many of @entity119 would n't be out of place in @entity287			0
' one thing that 's certain is @entity0 is a weak leader who is n't respected by his own mps			1

labour mps hail left 's ' exciting ' victory and demand end to ' savage cuts '
pressure will grow on @entity0 to change course and oppose austerity
greens say result in @entity6 marks start of ' ordinary people ' rising up
