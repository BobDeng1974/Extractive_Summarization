@entity6 researchers have discovered that dogs eavesdrop on what their owners are saying about their food , in order to decide whether they want to eat it or not			1
they conducted a series of experiments to find that dogs watch and listen to the way people interact with one another to work out who will provide the tastier meal			1
researchers found dogs use information gleaned from the interactions of one human with another			1
in picture a a man tells the woman how tasty the cornflakes were , in b he returns the ' disgusting ' cereal and in c the dog approaches the woman with the tastier cornflakes the research , described in the @entity35 journal , builds on another study , which demonstrated that dogs carefully watch the behaviour and emotions of people			1
the new study , conducted by scientists at the @entity43 , found dogs use information gleaned from the interactions of one human with another , instead of a person ’s direct interaction with them			1
scientists are undecided about how much dogs really understand the actions of humans in the experiment , dogs watched a man ask two different women for a bowl of cornflakes			1
while both women supplied the man with cornflakes , he told one woman how delicious the cereal was and returned the bowl with the same food in it to the other woman , telling her it was disgusting			2
after his interactions with the women , he left and a dog that had been watching the exchange was let off its lead			0
the animal preferred the woman who had provided the ' tasty ' cereal			2
however , in some repetitions of the test some dogs did not approach either of the women , suggesting that the outcome of the experiment was not entirely clear cut			0
other studies have found that puppies can tell if their owner is happy by looking at their facial expression , compared with a neutral one , @entity85 reported			0
dogs have also been found to prefer people who share food , and in one study by the @entity96 , @entity97 , sought out the company of crying people instead of those who talked or hummed			0
researchers found the canines sniffed , nuzzled and licked crying strangers			0
while there is an argument that dogs only watch interactions between people , instead of a person ’s reaction to an object , a previous study discovered that dogs are able to pick out boxes that excited a person			2
however , many scientists are undecided about how much dogs really understand the actions of humans .			0

@entity6 researchers conducted a series of experiments to find that dogs watch and listen to the way people interact with one another
@entity43 scientists set up an experiment in which dogs watched a man react differently to eating two bowls of cornflakes
they found the dogs preferred the person who had offered the man the ' tasty ' cereal
