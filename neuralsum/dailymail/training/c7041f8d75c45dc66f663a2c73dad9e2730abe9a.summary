a week dominated by headlines about the most famous @entity1 in the @entity2 can end with a fellow sardinian with his name in lights			1
the tremors were almost off racing ’s @entity7 when @entity9 lost the ride on @entity11 on monday			1
the 43 - year - old , on board @entity14 ’s @entity13 in this afternoon ’s £ 650,000 @entity12 , will be an observer at @entity17 tomorrow when the filly tries to justify her place as @entity21 favourite against nine rivals in the @entity23			1
@entity24 poses at @entity25 on friday 23 - year - old @entity24 rides @entity26 in october 2013 @entity24 has already ridden some winners this week - pictured jockeying @entity28 on thursday by then @entity24 , 20 years @entity9 ’s junior , could be dreaming of the biggest race in @entity30 on october 5 should 3 - 1 favourite @entity26 do what he and trainer @entity32 believe he can over the extended mile and three - quarters of the season ’s final classic			1
that is how highly they regard their colt , winner of the @entity42 @entity41 at the course last year			2
he has yet to win this season but produced solid efforts in both the @entity46 and @entity47 while his @entity49 second , when length and a quarter behind @entity51 , is form none of his rivals can touch			2
this a group one performer up against fair rivals but ones who ca n’t boast a win above @entity61 level between them			0
with @entity64 giving @entity26 the green light to run after fears over the ground , there is an issue over whether @entity26 will stay			1
@entity69 shocked the racing world when he failed to win on @entity11 on monday ' do n't stare ' ridden by @entity24 wins the @entity71 @entity32 , trainer of @entity26 , is hopeful of a win on saturday afternoon at @entity25 his sire @entity74 has yet to father a winner at today ’s trip but his performance over a mile and a half in the @entity49 hardly suggests lack of staying power			1
@entity24 , who needs two winners to ride 100 in a season for a first time , does n’t think so			1
he said : ‘ in the @entity49 , the draw did n’t look good and i had to use the horse to get a position			2
he still galloped all the way to the line so has every chance of staying			0
‘ he has never been a flashy worker but his work last week was better than ever			0
he has never run a bad race and ran a blinder in the @entity49 probably against the best horse out there			2
to win my first classic would be amazing			0
’ @entity24 , recently appointed @entity99 ’s 2015 successor as no 1 jockey to @entity101 , faces a strong challenge from sir @entity105 ’s @entity104 winner and @entity107 runner - up @entity108			1
he will also respect team @entity14 – the trainer has won the race four times - which also includes @entity114 and @entity115			0
if his temperament can be kept in check , @entity118 can out - run his long odds			0
and @entity24 will not be taking anything for granted , the fate of @entity121 in yesterday ’s @entity122 ’s @entity71 underlined racing ’s propensity for the unexpected			2
the @entity127 - trained colt was cruising to victory when veering right and unseating jockey @entity130 yards from the line handing victory @entity133 ’s @entity132			0
in contrast , the @entity134 was a thoroughly worthy length and a quarter winner of the @entity138 under @entity139 , digging deep to pull clear of @entity140			0
however , a tilt at the @entity142 with @entity134 is now looking unlikely .			0

23 - year - old @entity144 could steal the headlines from @entity9 if he wins
@entity9 , 43 , shocked the racing world when he lost on @entity11 on monday
@entity24 rides 3 - 1 favourite @entity26 on saturday , but there are concerns over whether the horse will stay
the @entity1 needs two winners to ride 100 in a season for the first time
