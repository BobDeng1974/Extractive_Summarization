self - styled ' anarchist libertarian ' squatters have set up camp in one of @entity4 's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading ' homes for all '			1
the protesters mounted @entity8 , which joins @entity9 with the @entity10 , and called for others to join them			1
it is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight , as a garbled message posted on @entity17 by the group simply calls for ' christmas lights ... any and all radical / revolutionary messages '			1
but banners bearing messages such as ' better squat than let homes rot ' and ' respect existence or expect resistance ' were seen hanging from the @entity27 - i listed building , as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side			1
the five protesters from anti fascist group ' @entity62 ( @entity63 ) ' called for support in a message on their @entity17 page as police converged on the area			1
they posted : ' urgent shoutout for banners , @entity50 lights and anything else we can use to make the most of this massive canvas we have			1
any and all radical / revolutionary messages welcome , but a preference for antifa ( sic ) in anticipation of the pegeda event on the 4th of this month			2
' one onlooker , who asked not to be named , said : ' i 've seen a couple of guys on different parts of the roof throughout this morning			2
' all they were doing was shouting power to the people			2
i have no idea how they got in there because i 'm pretty sure it 's offices			2
' a man was walking across the roof of the arch this afternoon wearing a black sleeveless hoodie with the hood pulled up and a black scarf across his face			2
they added five photographs of themselves up on the building			2
they are believed to be the same group who took over the former offices of the @entity109 on @entity10 in central @entity4 last month			1
the building , not far from @entity112 , was targeted because it was originally opened by @entity113 , the groups said at the time			2
the squatters later bragged that it ' was n't difficult ' to get into the historic landmark which is a five minutes walk from @entity112			2
the group said they got into the building overnight by climbing through an unlocked window			1
proclaiming that what they were doing was ' more punk rock than the @entity127 , ' one of the men , who only gave his name as ' @entity123 ' said the group decided to take @entity8 because it was a ' significant ' building a stone 's throw away from the @entity112			1
' @entity123 ' , who claimed to be one of the founders of the @entity134 , said : ' we decided to take it because it is a significant building - you can see @entity112 - there is a significant flow of traffic and we wanted to highlight the fact there are some corrupt individuals affecting this country and they need to get dragged out			2
banners bearing housing messages were seen hanging from the @entity27 - i listed building as the masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side ' also , we wanted to highlight the fact that there are so many people that are homeless			2
' we got in overnight through a window that was unlocked and just climbed in through that , there 's about 15 of us here			0
' the ironic thing is that we had been evicted from the building in @entity10 and all we were doing was walking around here when a security guard said ' you ca n't come in here , you ca n't take this ' - which said to us it must be empty and that 's when we decided we could take it			0
' we are trying our hardest to keep it clean and tidy , but when your squatting in central @entity4 the chaos does take its toll			0
' we want to stay here as long as we can			0
' @entity175 admitted he was one of the hooded figures seen standing on the roof of the arch today and said he was shouting ' power to the people			0
' he also said that some of his colleagues were shouting ' acab ' which stands for ' all cops are b * * * * * ds. ' he added : ' that is not something i join in with [ shouting about police ] because i find a lot of police officers can be quite reasonable			0
' a ' notice to vacate ' has been posted up the entrances to the landmark , however @entity175 warned that if the group are evicted ' there may be some individuals that do resistance			1
' another squatter , who asked not to be named , said : ' we decided to take it because it is two fingers up to the @entity205			0
' we are anarchists , we are not left wing or right wing , we are anarchists - look up the dictionary definition of the word			0
' the @entity127 need to start doing a new album because what we are doing is more punk rock than the @entity127			0
' asked how long he wanted to squat in the landmark he replied ' indefinitely			0
' it is not the first time protesters have ' taken over ' @entity8 in 2006 , 14 @entity219 protesters spent a day on the arch demonstrating over claims the government is using illegally logged wood			1
the gatehouse , built as a memorial to @entity55 @entity54 , was sold in 2012 after a @entity57 hotel developer paid £ 60 million to buy it from the government the five protesters from anti fascist group ' @entity62 ( @entity63 ) ' called for support in a message on their @entity17 page as police converged on the area they added five photographs of themselves up on the building			1

' they remain on the roof			0
' @entity17 user love activists posted : ' love activists , @entity257 and the @entity258 have occupied the old cabinet office opposite trafalgar square , on the road which leads directly towards the palace			0
we call out for all hands to assist us			0
