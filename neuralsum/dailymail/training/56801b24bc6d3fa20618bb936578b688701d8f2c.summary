by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 08:21 est , 8 september 2012 a dramatic plan to transport humans beyond the solar system within 100 years today received the backing of former president @entity5			1
the 100 - year @entity7 project , which was set up with @entity9 military seed funding , plans to develop huge ' starships ' to send humans far into space			1
next week it will meet to discuss the plans and begin the huge task			1
@entity16 , the first serious attempt to design a ship capable of travelling to the nearest stars			2
weighing 50,000 tonnes , powered by nuclear fusion , travelling at 12 % of the speed of light , the journey time would be close to 50 years			2
it has already received large amounts of funding , and former president @entity5 has even stepped in to serve as the symposium 's honorary chair			1
in a statement , @entity5 said : ' this important effort helps advance the knowledge and technologies required to explore space , all while generating the necessary tools that enhance our quality of life on earth			1
' the astronuat who became the first black woman in space in 1992 has been chosen to skipper the ' 100 year starship ' project			1
@entity42 will lead the project to explore what it would take for a multigenerational mission beyond the solar system			1
' @entity7 will make the capability of human travel beyond our solar system to another star a reality over the next 100 years , ' she said			2
the massive craft needed to escape our solar system next to @entity56 cathedral conceived by the @entity57 , @entity16 was a thirteen member volunteer engineering design study conducted between 1973 and 1978 , to demonstrate that interstellar travel is feasible in theory			2
the basis of this belief was the demonstration of a credible engineering design just at the outset of the space age that could in theory , cross the interstellar distances			0
@entity16 demonstrated that with current , and near future , technology , interstellar travel is feasible			0
' we will embark on a journey across time and space			0
' if my language is dramatic , it is because this project is monumental			1
and our team is both invigorated and sobered by the confidence @entity82 has in us to make interstellar flight a reality			0
' the project began with an award by the @entity82 of a $ 500,000 contract to study what is needed for long term projects such as interstellar space missions			1
the group has teamed with @entity92 and the @entity93			0
@entity94 , director of @entity92 , said : ' @entity95 will be producing designs and doing basic research with the common goal of building the technical foundation required for eventual successful interstellar flight			0
' however , the team has not underestimated the task			0
it has already produced a list of what needs to be done ' a venture to the stars will require the creation of revolutionary energy generation , storage and control systems , advanced propulsion systems , radical advancements in closed - loop , life - support systems , and new insights into human development , health , behaviour and training , as well as advances in robotics , automation , intelligent systems , and manufacturing techniques , ' it says on its website			0
' programs to establish a human presence on the moon , @entity131 , or elsewhere in our solar system will be stepping - stones to the stars			0
' the 1970s project planned an entire mission , and found a two stage spacecraft was the best option			1
weighing 50,000 tonnes and powered by nuclear fusion the journey time would be close to 50 years			0
the 1970s plans could now be re-examined thanks to the 100 year starship project			2

project has received the backing of @entity5 , who is set to chair the project 's symposium next week
*non-profit* scheme has already received funding after an *initial* seed *investment* by the @entity9 military
