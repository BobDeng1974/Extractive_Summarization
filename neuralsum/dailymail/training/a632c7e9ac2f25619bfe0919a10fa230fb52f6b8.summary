by @entity0 published : 04:48 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 05:21 est , 23 august 2013 from elegant chignons to elaborate curls , there 's no shortage of hairstyles for women to try			0
but for long - haired men , the options have been few - until now			2
bored with seeing the same styles , blogger @entity9 decided to give men the chance to try the looks loved by the ladies - with entertaining results			1
she explains : ' one of my co-workers was talking about men with top - knots , and i said " would n’t it be funny if they got , like , prom - style up - do ’s instead ? " we agreed that it would be funny , and so [ the project ] began			1
glamorous : volunteer @entity26 ups his style game with the pretty @entity30 style looking good : @entity31 does his best @entity34 film star pout and hair swish for the camera ' i found eight guys with long hair and [ asked ] them [ to ] meet me at @entity39 in downtown @entity40 to get their hair styled in to formal up - do ’s - until now reserved for women on their way to a wedding or a prom			1
' the stylists came up with a " story " for each guy , and the photographer took before and after photos			0
the after photos were a bit of a struggle because no one could stop laughing			0
' among the styles given to her eight brave volunteers were the ' @entity30 ' ( tumbling glossy waves ) , the ' @entity59 ' ( an elaborate up - do ) and the ' @entity60 ' ( a backcombed chignon )			1
although the project was originally conceived as an amusing photo essay , the reaction to the photos has surprised @entity9			1
pretty : ' @entity65 had his hair braided into plaits for the @entity70 look creative : not content with his romantic up - do , @entity65 accessorised with flowers in both hair and beard @entity75 ! @entity76 works a pretty up - do perfectly suited to @entity59 - even with neck hair cute : with a delicate sprig of flowers to complete the look , all @entity76 needs now is a date and a tuxedo ' honestly , i just thought it would be a funny photo essay , ' she reveals			1
' [ but ] when i told my roommate about it she was like " ohhh , i just love how you ’re challenging gender norms ! " and at the time i was like " no ! you ’re thinking too hard ! it ’s just guys with fancy hair , that ’s it			0
" ' but , looking at it now , it ca n’t help but at least nod in that direction			0
more than that though , if we ’re going to look at it seriously , i think it speaks to the fact that men are cheated when it comes to style			2
ageless : as @entity110 proves , it 's not just twenty - something men who look good with fancy lady hair schoolmarm ? @entity110 looks a touch severe with his matronly chiignon but gets a manly touch from the quiff ' both men and women can grow their hair out but women have an insane number of websites and magazines dedicated to all their styling options , whereas what ’s " acceptable " for men is basically a lackluster low ponytail or maybe a bun			2
' this could have so easily gone in the direction of drag , but i think by staying away from makeup and having them wear whatever they came in with , it instead asks the question , " yeah , why do n’t men get to do more fun things with their hair ? " ' many people have commented that the after 's look even better than the before 's			0
' the photoshoot took longer than anticipated as many of the subjects got the giggles as they were being made over			0
