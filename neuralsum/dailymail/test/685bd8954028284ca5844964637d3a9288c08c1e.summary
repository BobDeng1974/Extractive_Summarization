@entity0 came through an injury scare and @entity2 fell just short of a century against his own team - mates as @entity5 's test warm - ups descended into a glorified training drill			1
events at @entity8 , where the decision was made to cull @entity11 managing director @entity10 , seemed rather more relevant to the future of @entity14 cricket than the mix - and - match day at @entity16 , where four members of the touring party were parachuted in to bolster the local team			2
@entity20 ( nought ) and @entity21 ( 17 ) largely failed to do so , but @entity2 made 98 and @entity22 ended the day 87 not out in a score of 303 for nine			1
@entity5 paceman @entity0 ( left ) bowls at @entity2 on wednesday it seemed entirely in keeping with the unsatisfactory nature of @entity5 's test preparation week that @entity2 , the only member of the seconded quarter not likely to feature in the series , had the most productive day			1
at least @entity0 averted serious injury when he collapsed clutching his left ankle in the second over			1
@entity0 initially looked in trouble when his boot slid through the crease and he tumbled to the ground , and coach @entity36 was concerned enough to stride out to the middle to assess the damage			2
but he spent just short of an hour off the field with an ice pack and later returned to the attack			1
@entity0 required lengthy treatment on the pitch after clutching his left ankle following his fall @entity0 was concerned enough about the run - ups to summon the groundstaff the ball before coming to grief			1
he initially suggested bowling round the wicket in search of firmer footing but decided to go back to his original angle of attack after sawdust was applied			0
when he went down the game was just 10 balls old - the same number of deliveries that were possible in the infamous abandoned @entity59 in @entity60 six years ago			0
by that stage , the first of @entity5 's honorary @entity62 had already come and gone			1
@entity5 captain @entity64 ( right ) watches on as ground staff make running repairs to the crease @entity20 opened the batting but lasted just three balls , guiding @entity70 straight to @entity71 at third slip			2
that was hardly the added steel @entity5 were looking for			2
the same was largely true of @entity75 , who seems short of his best after a troubled @entity78 , and managed only 17 before an ill - judged cut against @entity71 ended up in @entity81 's gloves			0
@entity82 had earlier ripped out @entity84 ' middle stump and @entity71 had @entity85 lbw offering no stroke			0
@entity2 , whose likely @entity59 role is as @entity81 's back - up , reached lunch on 33 not out in a score of 55 for four			1
@entity2 fell just short of a century against @entity5 on wednesday he continued to score briskly in the afternoon and was just two short of a ton when @entity82 found his outside edge to have him caught behind			1
the game lacked all semblance of competitive edge , even as @entity22 compiled a trouble - free half - century of his own , but there were some possible pointers ahead the first test in @entity60			0
@entity71 clearly outbowled @entity99 in the race for the spinner 's role and @entity103 failed to take a wicket despite seeing plenty of the ball			0
he came into this game in pole position but could fall behind @entity109 or @entity110 , who will open the bowling for @entity62 on thursday morning			0
@entity20 opened the batting @entity62 but lasted just three balls @entity2 gave little away about dressing room reaction to @entity10 's departure , partly because he was ready to go out and bat as the news was delivered in the lunch interval			1
' we just found out at lunch ,			0
no - one said anything , it was straight back out and get on with our job out here in @entity62 , ' he said			0
' i do n't know what the role entails or anything like that , it 's a decision that 's taken above us ... i do n't know what the job description is			0
' it 's our job out here to get on with the task at hand and win a series for @entity5			2
