by @entity0 published : 17:30 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 20:54 est , 7 march 2014 when it comes to ' corporate firefighting ' and ' pan-functional team - building ' , there 's only one man for the job - @entity7 , @entity10 's hilariously incompetent @entity9 in the @entity12 comedy @entity13			1
and now he 's back in a brand new sitcom that will have us falling about with laughter again , even if we have n't got a clue what he 's on about			0
this time , in @entity19 , he has the bigwigs at @entity21 in his sights - or as @entity10 puts it , he aims to ' clarify , define , or re-define the core purpose of the @entity25 across all its functions '			1
@entity7 arrives at the @entity25 with his trusty bike in the new comedy @entity19 @entity13 , which ran for two series and won a @entity30 , was a runaway success , sending up the @entity32 and the managerial chaos behind them			1
the show launched to tiny audiences on @entity36 and quickly became a word - of - mouth success , as the understated humour and all - too - believable characters caught on			2
but after it transferred to @entity41 , millions caught up with the running gags about jargon and managerial incompetence			0
the big - name stars helped - not just @entity10 , whose character was in charge of everything from publicity to traffic lights , but @entity51 , who played his long - suffering @entity52 and ardent admirer @entity53			2
she was the only efficient person in the @entity55 and all the work fell on her shoulders , but she was willing to do anything for her beloved boss			0
@entity51 won a @entity30 for her role as @entity53 in @entity13 her performance won @entity51 a @entity30 too , for @entity62			0
the show was never expected to have a sequel - ' the clue to that was in the name , ' jokes writer and director @entity68			1
but it won such acclaim that inevitably some of its central characters have found themselves in new careers ... and where better than the @entity25 ? ' i never expected there to be a sequel to @entity13 , the clue is in the name ' @entity68 @entity19 's premise is simple			1
swamped by bad headlines and desperate for the licence fee to be renewed , the governors of the @entity25 need someone to steady the ship			1
and of course , since the @entity12 were such a success , they bring in @entity7 - unaware of all the behind - the - scenes disasters he 'd been embroiled in ... or had caused			2
with a wry smile , @entity10 says that the @entity25 has been offered ' a lot of learning opportunities in recent years ' - management - speak for the catalogue of crises that have engulfed the corporation			1
' it was only a matter of time before the @entity25 reached out for a new head of values - and @entity7 was the man for the job , ' says @entity10 , who promises that his folding bicycle , the perfect symbol for his eco-friendly ethics and ridiculous image , will also make a comeback ... even if his character still has n't mastered the technique of folding it without severing a finger			1
the first obstacle he encounters when he arrives at @entity21 is the @entity25 's new ' hot - desking ' policy that allows anyone to work anywhere , meaning they must lug their laptops around with them too			1
' in the first episode , i think the defining message is how to find a desk , ' says @entity10			0
the writer of @entity13 , @entity68 , said he never expected to create a sequel ' because the wonderful , open - plan , hot - desking principle at the @entity25 , which really does n't allow you to sit down for any longer than five minutes , keeps the corporation quite literally on its toes			1
@entity7 is very keen to get the message across that his office door is always open , the only downfall being that there is no office			0
' @entity68 , who created both @entity13 and @entity19 , calls @entity10 ' the funniest straight - man actor in @entity130			1
he 's consistently funny , even when he 's not saying anything			0
my favourite moments are when another character is talking nonsense and the camera cuts to @entity10			0
before he says a line , the comedy effect has been doubled by the expression on his face			2
the secret lies behind his eyes			0
@entity10 brings a really elusive quality - he 's able to give you access to what he must be thinking but not saying			2
' with the @entity25 ' brand ' set to be such a crucial worldwide asset , they also hire the jargon - spouting pr consultant who handled the @entity12 publicity - @entity151 ( played by @entity153 ) who is @entity7 's biggest nightmare			1
it 's a chance for the characters ( who cordially loathe each other ) to 're - meet and recalibrate their relationship ' , as @entity10 puts it with a laugh			2
@entity151 's greatest regret is that she is n't @entity164			0
she does n't do lunch , or relationships - they 're both for wimps - and when she opens her mouth , verbiage tumbles out			2
' if you get bandwidth on this , you 've got maple syrup on your waffle at the get - go			2
' and there are new characters , including a @entity179 with the power to veto any programme , played by @entity182			0
@entity182 's career has been in overdrive for the past year , including a starring role in the saturday teatime blockbuster @entity186 ; in @entity19 she gets to play a blustering bully called @entity188			1
' she 's this high - powered , frightening , intimidating , very definite person , ' explains @entity182			2
' when she makes a decision , she makes it			0
unfortunately it 's always wrong ! she 's good at talking the talk			0
when @entity7 arrives , @entity188 is quite defensive : she 's suspicious of him , just in case he actually does know what he 's talking about ! ' @entity153 will return as her character @entity151 in @entity19 real - life @entity25 executives might be expected to feel more than a little anxious about a satire set in their own offices			1
but @entity68 insists the top brass have left the actors to get on with it , and that senior managers have not even asked to see a script , let alone demanded cuts or rewrites			1
it might ruffle a few feathers , though , he warns			1
' this is certainly no love letter to the @entity25 , but it is a gentle satire			1
it 's benign ... even if that 's not fashionable			0
' it 's more than just a laugh at the @entity25 's expense , even though the title is a direct reference to the postcode of @entity21 in @entity218 , where the series was actually filmed			1
the cast hope that , as with @entity13 , millions of viewers will spot the resemblance to their own working lives			0
' @entity13 was about satirising management structure and management speak , ' says @entity10 , ' and all the pitfalls of a team trying to do something en masse when all people are doing is passing the buck			0
the same flavour is there in @entity19 - we 're not deriding the @entity25 but we are having an interesting look at the way some decisions are reached			1
this could quite easily have been set in the @entity239 or @entity240			0
' @entity241 and @entity153 will return to our screens this month in @entity19 but the satire neatly skewers the @entity25 's addiction to jargon and meaningless titles , as executive producer @entity247 admits			1
' i was asked 20 years ago to be @entity249 , which meant non-narrative sketch shows			0
i said i did n't want to be head of anything broken , so a title had to be invented - i was made @entity254 , which then suggested comedy existed that was n't entertainment			1
' he took the precaution , before @entity19 started filming , of confirming with @entity261 , the director - general , that there were no plans to appoint a real - life @entity264 , and was told the post would remain vacant ... at least as long as @entity19 was on the air			1
@entity247 's own title now is executive producer			0
as he defines it , ' the producer 's the guy who does the day - to - day work ; the executive producer is the guy who gets the credit			2
' viewers who missed @entity13 should not expect a glib comedy packed with one - liners			1
the dialogue in @entity19 is stuttering : characters start to say something and get bogged down in their own incoherence			1
' with comedy there are 100 ways to set up a situation , and 99 of them simply are n't funny			0
finding the right one is the hardest work imaginable ' @entity68 often they suddenly cut off in mid-sentence , aware that they should n't give voice to whatever they 're thinking			1
it 's subtle , and all too easy to relate to , with a twinge of embarrassment			0
but despite the stumbling and the mumbling , there 's no improvisation by the cast in @entity19 - nor was there in @entity13			1
every ' umm ' and ' err ' is scripted			0
that puts huge pressure on the actors , because in a scene with five or six people , it only takes one tiny error , one word a second too early , and they have to start again			0
' the show might look like it happened to fall together , ' @entity68 says , ' but getting it precisely right take after take is exhausting			1
and that process continues in the editing suite - comedy focuses on the tiniest of details			2
with drama you might tell a scene in ten different ways , but with comedy there are 100 ways to set up a situation , and 99 of them simply are n't funny			0
finding the right one is the hardest work imaginable - and if it flops , everyone notices			0
' the question every @entity13 fan will be asking is what 's happened to @entity7 's doting @entity335 ( @entity51 )			0
sadly , she is n't returning , though the writer does promise viewers will learn what happened between @entity339 and @entity7 on their fateful trip to @entity341 at the end of the last series			2
but love , or perhaps a catastrophic office affair , is on the horizon for the @entity25 's new head of values			2
whether his career can withstand it is an outcome that , as @entity7 might say , will be determined following the appraisal of the blue sky interpersonal reassessment session			0
in other words ... wait and see			0
@entity19 will air on @entity41 later this month .			2

the award winning comedy - twenty twelve - returns to our screens
the new series , @entity19 will focus on the bigwigs of the @entity25
writer - @entity68 - says it may ruffle a few feathers at the @entity25
