a functioning man - made leaf that absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen , just like natural leaves , has been created by an art graduate			1
the new material could provide a steady source of oxygen for humans on long missions in space and even help us colonise new planets			2
@entity15 claims that the leaves could also transform life on @entity18 as we know it , because buildings could be clad with the material to oxygenate homes and polluted urban areas			1
he thinks the material could be used in space exploration , the colonising of planets and to clad buildings back on @entity18 @entity15 claims that the leaves could facilitate long - distance space travel by providing oxygen on future space craft			1
they could be dumped on planets that humans will colonise , as ' real ' plants ca n't grow in zero gravity			0
but the man - made leaves also need water to perform photosynthesis			0
the leaves could be used in interior design on @entity18 and the designer has already made lightshade using the material , which could oxygenate as well as decorate rooms			1
he thinks the leaves could be used to clad buildings and even funnel the oxygen produced inside structures			2
the @entity57 graduate told @entity58 that @entity59 is researching ways to ensure a supply of oxygen over long journeys so that people can live in space , but that plants do n’t grow in zero gravity			0
‘ this material could allow us to explore space much further than we can now , ’ he said			0
mr @entity15 , who lives in @entity70 , was working on his leaf while on the @entity57 ’s @entity72 and collaborated with scientists at @entity75 silk lab in @entity76 to engineer the material			1
it is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells that are suspended in a web of silk protein			1
the protein is extracted from natural silk fibres			0
‘ this material has amazing properties of stabilising molecules , ’ he explained in a video			0
the material is made up of chloroplasts from plant cells ( illustrated ) that are suspended in a web of silk protein			1
the protein is extracted from natural silk fibres mr @entity15 claims that he has made the ' first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does			1
' but just like real leaves , the new material needs a small amount of fresh water and light to produce oxygen , which still needs to be discovered on planets for humans to call home			2
mr @entity15 says that his material consumes very little energy and as a result he thinks it could be incorporated into modern buildings , to absorb carbon dioxide			0
it could be used to clad facades , ventilation systems , he said			0
‘ you can absorb air from outside , pass it through these biological filters and then bring oxygenated air inside			0
’ he has so far created lampshades made from the material , which produce oxygen while helping to light up a home			2
the project was showcased as part of @entity58 and @entity124			0

mr @entity15 claims that he has made the ' first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does			1
' but just like real leaves , the new material ( pictured ) needs a small amount of fresh water and light to produce oxygen , which still needs to be discovered on planets for humans to call home the leaves could be used to clad facades , ventilation systems , their creator said			1
he has so far created lampshades made from the material ( pictured ) , which produce oxygen while helping to light up a home			2

a graduate for the @entity57 , @entity70 , created the leaves
they are made from chloroplasts found in plant cells , that are suspended in a web of silk protein and can produce oxygen
@entity15 claims he has made he ' first photosynthetic material that is living and breathing as a leaf does '
leaves could be used to provide oxygen on other planets and *spacecraft* to enable long - distance space exploration
they could also be used to clad buildings on @entity18 and in interior design
