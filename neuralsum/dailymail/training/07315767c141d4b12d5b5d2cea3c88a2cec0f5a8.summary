by @entity0 published : 04:04 est , 31 may 2012 updated : 07:19 est , 31 may 2012 a mother of three who was attacked by a flesh - eating bacteria that has killed others and forced them to have limbs amputated has survived the terrifying ordeal			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , fell over on the gravel path leading to her house but thought nothing of the tiny cut , which did not even rip her jeans			2
the following day , ms @entity7 found that the cut had dramatically increased in size and was persuaded to go to hospital by her worried family			1
nightmare scenario : @entity7 thought nothing of the tiny cut she suffered after falling on her driveway - but the injury quickly developed into a huge wound lucky : ms @entity7 , her daughter @entity23 and the rest of the family are delighted she has beaten the killer disease doctors diagnosed a flesh - eating disease and broke the news to her family that she was unlikely to survive			1
the disease , known as @entity32 , has sparked panic in @entity34 , where four victims have contracted it			1
@entity37 , 24 , woke from a coma last week after a quadruple amputation while grandfather @entity40 lost his leg after cutting it in water			1
@entity44 , 36 , was infected after she gave birth to twins at an @entity48 hospital and @entity49 , 32 , was told doctors would need to rebuild his groin after his infection swelled to the size of a grapefruit			1
bacteria in the bug releases toxins into the skin and muscle , forcing it to waste away			0
grave consequences : the 43 - year - old old was told she might not survive and could face a leg amputation , before a vacuum pump was attached to her leg to remove fluid from the wound toxic virus : ms @entity7 spent four weeks in hospital after surgeons cut out the killer infection necrotizing fasciitis , more commonly known as ' flesh - eating disease ' , is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection			1
' @entity75 ' refers to something that causes body tissue to die , and the infection can destroy skin , muscles and fat			0
the disease develops when the bacteria enters the body , often through a minor cut or scrape			1
as the bacteria multiply , they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area			2
because it is so virulent , the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body			0
symptoms include small , red lumps or bumps on the skin , rapidly - spreading bruising , sweating , chills , fever and nausea			0
organ failure and shock are also common complications			0
sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death , and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue			0
amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg			1
patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up , to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons			0
the bug may have been laying dormant in ms @entity7 , but a scrape to her knee gave the virus a chance to spread			2
ms @entity7 , 43 , said : ' i was terrified			2
i had never heard of this disease and could n't believe a tiny little cut nearly killed me			0
' the attack meant my organs were affected and my lungs started failing			0
my family were called in to say goodbye because nobody thought i 'd pull through , and i was told i could lose my leg			1
' she was rushed in to surgery and despite their fears , doctors were able to save her leg and her life			0
but she was left with a shocking scar on her left leg , from her thigh to her knee , where surgeons had cut out the killer infection			0
when she came round , her family were gathered at her bedside , including her distraught daughter @entity23 , 21			0
ms @entity7 said : ' the first thing my daughter asked me was if i still had my leg - i had to reach under the covers to feel if it was still there			1
' it looked like a piece of meat , i was so shocked to think the small cut i 'd had before could have turned into that			0
' fortunately ms @entity7 's leg had not been amputated , but half of the skin on her leg had gone			1
covered up : the mother of three before the fall , left , and today , right , after several skin grafts global problem : @entity34 graduate @entity37 , 24 , underwent a quadruple amputation after the bacteria appeared in a cut on her leg she would not have been so lucky if her brother - in - law , @entity169 , had not insisted she seek medical attention			1
mr @entity169 , 48 , visited ms @entity7 the day after her fall last november , and saw that the wound was weeping and she was complaining her leg was throbbing			2
he called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital with a very low blood pressure and high temperature			1
as soon as doctors had examined ms @entity7 and received blood test results , she was told they were taking her to theatre and she had to give consent for her leg to be amputated if required			1
ms @entity7 spent four weeks in hospital , with vaccum pump treatment to remove fluid from her wound , and was given strong antibiotics to stop any further infection			2
she has since had a number of skin grafts done on the area , and is waiting for further surgery to reduce the scar			0
she said : ' i get aches from the skin grafts , and the scarred skin is very purple			0
' it upsets me that i ca n't wear the clothes i want to , but then i realise how lucky i am to actually be alive			0
' ms @entity7 is now able to walk , but faces several more rounds of surgery to help heal the skin on her leg doctors have told ms @entity7 she was right to get to hospital as early as she did , or she might not be alive today			1
her case was the first her surgeon had seen in 20 years , and her gp had never come across the illness			0
because of the flu - like symptoms that come from having a flesh - eating disease , most people do not get help in time and it becomes too late to save their limbs , and sometimes their lives			2
ms @entity7 added : ' it 's scary to think that while it was just a virus i had , it can get in so easily through a tiny open wound and be so lethal			2

doctors told @entity7 's family she was unlikely to pull through
she faced losing her leg after the bacteria spread through her body
the 43 - year - old was taken to hospital with low blood pressure , a high temperature and failing lungs
panic in @entity34 , @entity233 , after four people hospitalised with the disease
@entity37 , 24 , is *recovering* from quadruple amputation
