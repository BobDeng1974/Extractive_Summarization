the running of sunday 's @entity2 @entity1 remains a threat as organisers are still unsure of the impact @entity6 will have on @entity7 and the surrounding areas			1
the typhoon has been building over the @entity10 throughout the week and is expected to bring rain and heavy winds to the track - which could severely challenge the race			1
with the lights due to go out at 15:00 local time , there is little room for pushing the start back , as dusk falls fairly soon after the end of the grand prix			0
l - r : @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 after qualifying in @entity2 @entity24 ( left ) with his crew members on the way to taking pole in the @entity2 @entity1 an @entity30 spokesman explained why the race could not be moved , with sunday morning or later on saturday night originally mooted as potential options			1
' the timing for the organisers to change the time the race is held has passed , ' he said			2
' we will see what is going on in the morning			0
if that is a storm , what are you going to do ? the safety of the people , the spectators has to logically be the most important thing			0
' the situation is ever - changing , with the typhoon upgraded from a category one hurricane up to a category four inside 12 hours			0
it has also been at ' super typhoon ' levels after reaching winds of 150mph and the @entity30 is in constant contact with their forecasters			0
@entity58 ' @entity24 takes the acclaim after clinching pole position in @entity7 @entity62 's @entity61 walks out from his pit after the qualifying session championship leader @entity23 makes his way around the @entity2 circuit ' our team are monitoring at all times , ' the spokesman added			1
' everyone is trying to make sure the race can go ahead - but it will go ahead only if conditions in and around the circuit are safe			0
' there remains the possibility that the race could run behind the safety car if the weather was bad enough to warrant it - with half - points also an option should the entire race not be able to be completed			2
either way it adds another intriguing factor into the title battle between @entity58 pair @entity24 and @entity23 ahead of what will prove to be an interesting day .			1
