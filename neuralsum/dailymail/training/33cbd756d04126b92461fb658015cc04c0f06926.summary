@entity1 's chances of winning significant @entity3 reforms suffered a blow tonight after the new @entity6 chief @entity5 rejected limits on immigration			1
the nominee to be the next @entity11 president met meps from @entity14 's eurosceptic group in the @entity15 ahead of his coronation next week			0
mr @entity5 was asked directly if he would support any restrictions on free movement of workers within the @entity3			1
according to @entity21 meps at the meeting , he replied : ' no. ' mr @entity5 also raised the prospect of ' harmonising ' tax rates - which would be fiercely resisted in @entity25			2
@entity5 was grilled by @entity20 from @entity14 's group in the @entity15 tonight @entity27 , a @entity28 for the @entity29 , asked whether mr @entity5 agreed that free movement of people was a founding @entity3 principle and ‘ non-negotiable ’			1
he had barely finished asking the question , when mr @entity5 – who earlier joking asked chain - smoking mr @entity14 if he could have one of his cigarettes – interjected to say ‘ yes ’			2
mr @entity14 said afterwards that the exchange would hasten @entity38 ’s exit from @entity39			0
the @entity21 leader said : ‘ we are very pleased that mr @entity5 chose to come and speak to the most @entity43 group in the @entity15 which says something about him as a person			2
‘ we had a polite exchange of views but mr @entity5 made it absolutely clear that on the question of the free movement of peoples across the @entity3 , there was no question of any negotiation of that position			1
he showed himself to be completely out of touch by saying migration within the @entity3 was a ‘ marginal issue			0
’ in saying this , he will take the @entity38 closer to the @entity3 exit door			2
’ the new president faced down a question from an @entity65 mep about @entity39 being undemocratic , claiming ‘ there is no such thing as a @entity39 people ’ and that direct democracy at a @entity39 level ‘ does not work ’			0
however he did open the door to national governments taking further action to restrict migrants access to benefits saying that abuse of the system of free movement is ‘ for nation states to tackle ’			0
mr @entity5 's remarks tonight came after he earlier insisted he would not block @entity38 attempts to claw back powers from @entity6 - despite his public battle with mr @entity1 for the @entity3 's top job last month			1
the former @entity86 prime minister insisted he wanted @entity38 to stay in the @entity3 and said any proposals from @entity25 would be ' taken under consideration '			1
mr @entity1 , who has promised to offer an in - out referendum in 2017 after renegotiating @entity38 's relationship with @entity6			2
the prime minister last month warned that keeping @entity38 in the @entity3 had ' got harder ' because of mr @entity5			1
he described mr @entity5 ’s nomination as a ' bad day for the @entity3 ' and pledged to wage a ' long , tough fight ' to reform @entity6 before campaigning for the @entity38 to remain in the @entity3 in the in - out referendum he has promised to hold in 2017			1
but , speaking to @entity20 , mr @entity5 said that he is ready to begin talks with the @entity38 to return ' competences ' – @entity3 jargon for powers – back to the @entity38			1
in leaked remarks , published in the @entity99 , mr @entity5 told meps at a meeting in @entity6 : ' i would like @entity38 to stay as an active constructive member of the @entity3			1
if @entity38 puts forward a proposal it will be taken under consideration			0
' i am not in principle saying that no kind of repatriation can take place			0
if @entity25 wants to recover competences , ok			0
if the others agree it shall be done			0
' mr @entity5 insisted he was not a ' federalist ' - backing ever closer union between @entity39 states - and claimed there was not a single @entity39 people the nominee to become the next @entity11 chair was widely described in @entity25 as an ' arch federalist ' and @entity6 insider who was not suitable for the @entity3 's top job mr @entity5 , who is expected to be confirmed as @entity39 commission president during a vote of @entity20 on july 15 , replacing @entity126 , added : ' i 've never opposed the idea of a well - structured , well - organised , profoundly negotiated repatriation of competences from @entity6 to national parliaments			1
' i do n't want the @entity3 without @entity38			2
@entity38 is an essential element of policy making in @entity39 because the @entity38 are a common sense and down - to - earth people			0
' mr @entity5 also denied wanting a @entity136 of @entity39 - despite being widely described in @entity15 as an ' arch federalist			2
the @entity139 insider denied being a federalist in favour of ever - closer @entity3 , according to the @entity99 , telling @entity20 : ' i do n't think the @entity3 will become a state			0
i would fight against that			0
' but mr @entity5 risked controversy after responding to an attack on mr @entity1 by a @entity146 with a thumbs up gesture			1
@entity149 criticised the prime minister 's ' incompetent ' attempt to block him , and added that @entity152 were working hard to unseat him in next year ’s elections .			0
