by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 07:39 est , 31 october 2013 updated : 20:48 est , 31 october 2013 energy secretary @entity2 unveiled a package of reforms in the energy market energy bosses will face jail under plans to make the fixing of household fuel bills a crime			1
@entity2 , the energy secretary , yesterday said specific criminal penalties would apply to ‘ manipulation of the energy markets ’			1
modelled on those for the financial markets , where the maximum prison sentence for insider dealing is seven years , the details will be unveiled next year after a consultation			0
officials said they would apply to firms that artificially inflate prices to a level not justified by market forces or give inaccurate information about generating capacity or wholesale prices			1
mps claimed yesterday that the @entity32 energy firms appear to operate as a ‘ cartel ’			2
this prompted a furious response from @entity37 chief executive @entity36 who tweeted : ‘ lots of wild talk about cartels but no evidence and the facts do n’t support			0
where is the evidence ? put up or shut up			0
’ @entity37 announced this month it would be putting up prices by 10.4 per cent for its 3.1million customers from december 1			2
it was the third of the @entity32 to announce huge rises this winter – although regulator @entity50 says wholesale prices have only risen by 1.7 per cent in the last 12 months			1
in profile : the top five cheapest deals compared to the top five long - term fixed price deals are set out above under mr @entity2 ’s plans , energy firms would be forced to ‘ open up their books ’ so regulators can see the costs and profits of every arm of their business			1
he also pledged to reduce red tape to enable households to switch between energy firms within 24 hours			2
currently it can take five weeks			0
a look at current deals in the marketplace shows families can save up to £ 376 a year by switching from the most expensive variable tariffs			0
energy prices have dominated the agenda in recent weeks as the average dual fuel bill reaches £ 1,400 a year and @entity75 promises to freeze prices for 20 months if it wins the next election			0
the price hikes will add £ 50 to every family 's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £ 100 ministers say there must be more transparency about how wholesale prices feed through to bills , and have promised an annual ‘ competition test ’ by regulators			1
' the energy market needs to change to put consumers in control ' @entity2 , energy secretary but analysts expressed doubts about it , saying the energy market has been investigated several times over the past decade and no wrongdoing has been found			1
@entity50 ’s latest @entity99 in 2011 found no evidence of a cartel , but ordered firms to slash the number of tariffs they offer			0
the regulator has powers to fine a company 10 per cent of turnover and has imposed fines and redress worth £ 70million since 2010			2
mr @entity2 said : ‘ the energy market needs to change to put consumers in control			1
slump : just 341,000 people changed gas and electricity supplier in june this year , less than half of the numbers who switched in summer 2011 ' that means making it easy for people to change supplier to save money , it means regular market assessments to check their behaviour , and it means tougher penalties for market manipulation and putting an end to opaque finances			1
‘ energy companies need to know that any wrongdoing will be uncovered and dealt with			2
’ @entity133 and @entity134 claimed the @entity32 operate as a ‘ cartel ’			0
@entity75 ’s @entity136 said there was evidence for a ‘ hidden , protected , secret sort of cartel trading scheme ’ whereby energy companies trade with each other at above the wholesale price before passing the increases on to consumers			1
he was told @entity75 should hand over any evidence it has about wrongdoing			0
@entity148 promised last week to ‘ roll back green levies ’ which account for £ 112 of the average energy bill , and are set to reach £ 286 by 2020 .			0
