during the dreary winter months , many of us long for lighter evenings and sun rays hitting our windows			0
now there 's a solution - albeit an expensive one - that creates the illusion of summer in any room of the house at any time of year			0
designed by @entity13 , the £ 40,000 ( $ 61,000 ) artificial skylight mimics the appearance of the sun and sky using a phenomenon known as @entity18			1
@entity26 scattering is what causes the sky to appear blue , for example , and when blue light wavelengths travel through the atmosphere they are scattered @entity13 was set up by researchers from the @entity34 , in @entity35			1
each artificial skylight is fitted with a solid layer of nanoparticles that causes light to scatter			1

the layer also creates an illusion of depth to make the ' sun ' appear to be far away			2
it can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the @entity50 , @entity51 and northern @entity52			1
@entity53 60 produces ' cooler vertical ' rays with the ' maximum luminance contrast of light and shadow , ' as seen in tropical regions			0
the @entity51 - based @entity53 skylight features a 45 - degree ceiling beam that offers an equal balance of light and shade			2
while @entity64 uses a 30 - degree angle beam relative to the horizon to reproduce ' a warm , @entity68 grazing light			0
' known as @entity18 , this is what causes the sky to appear blue , for example			0
when blue light wavelengths travel through the atmosphere they are scattered by other particles to give the sky its hue			1
@entity53 ’s technology uses a similar principle to force light from a standard bulb to scatter in the same way			2
and it can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the @entity50 , @entity51 and northern @entity52			1

it can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the @entity50 , @entity51 and northern @entity52 @entity26 scattering occurs when light is scattered in different directions by small particles , typically smaller than the wavelength of the light being scattered			1
the phenomenon is commonly seen in gases , but can also apply to solids and liquids			0
@entity26 scattering is what causes the sky to appear blue			1
when sunlight travels through the atmosphere it is scattered by other particles			2
blue light is scattered more efficiently than other wavelengths of light which causes the sky to look blue the majority of the time			1
during sunrise and sunset , the sky appears red and orange because the sun ’s rays are passing directly through the atmosphere and red light is n’t scattered as much , so passes through the atmosphere unaffected			2
‘ @entity13 is an optical system based on nano technology to artificially reproduce the natural light and visual appearance of the sun and sky , ' said the company			1
‘ [ it ] offers a breakthrough opportunity for indoor architecture by creating the sensation of infinite space			0
the firm added that @entity13 is ideal for airports , offices , gyms and museums as well as underground networks and parking garages			0
in addition to £ 40,000 ( $ 61,000 ) for the technology , installation costs £ 5,000 ( $ 7,600 ) and requires at least 3.3ft ( one metre ) of ceiling recess for it to fit in			1
@entity13 is hoping that the technology could also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder ( @entity177 ) and other conditions			0
chief executive and associate professor of optics and @entity181 , @entity182 said : ' besides @entity177 , we see plenty of possible applications of @entity53 in hospitals			0
' ' naturally , @entity13 is foreseen to improve the quality of the overall treatment , with respect to comfort and [ relaxation ] , with benefit both for the patient and the hospital			0
